I knew this Porchetta ($9 for small) was a must order since everyone was raving about it! It came presented beautifully, with a golden crust surrounding all that protein. Eating the skin part was delightful, the crust was crackling which suit my fancy. However I thought the meat part was slightly dry. Maybe I just prefer the Chinese version of pork Belly.
Authentic Italian - highly recommend their roman schiacciata (Small for $10) which was stuffed with generous truffle mushroom filling.. so aromatic!! Pizza platter was amazing too~ we ordered the medium platter $24 which came in 12 slices (4 varieties - bacon zucchini, pepperoni, tuna, chicken&amp;mishroom). Starter $19 was a nice combination of taste and texture, with lightly creamy burrata, savoury parma ham, fresh rockets and juicy cherry tomato, quite expensive considering the portion though.

However unlike Etna’s posh setting, iO is more casual and laid back, perfect for a simple fuss free meal. However, don’t equate simplicity to lackadaisical. The food is hearty, comforting and delicious.\n<br />•\n<br />If you had to get one appetizer, I’d definitely recommend the porchetta. Coming in two sizes, (small is pictured, $9) the baked pork belly is stuffed with the aromatic wild fennel and served with spicy English mustard. The skin is crispy and the meat, delicious and well seasoned.\n<br />•\n<br />The only regret I had was that I didn’t order the larger portion😔
If you can\'t decide what pasta to get at io Italian osteria, this is definitely a good choice.\n<br />•\n<br />Swimming in all sorts of deliciousness, the al dente pasta was hearty, super comforting and packed with flavor, perfect amidst the stormy weather yesterday.\n<br />•\n<br />They were a bit heavy handed with the parmesan but def not a big deal. Will definitely reorder it again👌
So crisp, so stuffed, so freaking fragranttttttt!! 😍😭Ordered this to share among friends but had I known how amazing it was, would never had even shared... #juzsaying ❤️❤️ #mustorder !!
Made an impromptu visit for some casual, homey Italian grub. Food was served very quickly and generally pretty good!
Ordered the Porchetta (Baked Pork Belly) with Wild Fennel. The small portion was good for 2, priced at $9 which we thought was very reasonable. The chunks of fat melted in my mouth. 😍 Try it with a bit of the mustard sauce, gives it a different burst of flavour.
This dish is so worth your money. Excellent choice as a starter/ appetiser! 
Truffle pasta was on point. The crispy skin on the pork belly was amazing. Price wise was decent
Stuffed with the wonder combination of cream cheese and truffle. Need I say more? The schiacciata is toasted to perfection, has a slightly chewy texture, and the fluffy bits inside soak up the cream cheese and truffle, and every bite keeps you wanting for more.
Crispy crackling, juicy and meaty mixed with the wild fennel, each bite is full of dimension. Mustard  adds a nice cut as well. This is a must order every time I\'m here and it never fails to disappoint.
The food here is AMAZING. My friend has visited Italy and she said that the food here tastes way better than in Italy which means this is legit. I stay in the east and don\'t drive but will definitely get my ass here to eat the truffle bread thing its heavenly. I would give this place 10 out 5 stars 10/5 
Fluffy Mascarpone, smidge of Pistachio Praline and coffee soaked sponge finished with a generous shaving of the characteristic Iranian Pistachio. \n<br />Unanimous favourite of the squad. Good for sharing. \n<br />14bucks/slice\n<br />#FTrecommends 
Baked pork belly stuffed with fennel, served with a side of spicy mustard. Great flavours though the flesh was screaming for more salt. 
Margarita, Fennel Sausage, Bacon &amp; Zucchini and Pepperonis baked on @italianosteriasg\'s signature housemade one-inch Schiacciata crust.\n<br />We spared no crumb. \n<br />24bucks/Medium Slab (12 slices)\n<br />#FTrecommends
Traditional Roman Schiacciata ($18)
Burrata &amp; Parma Ham ($19)
Run by the same team behind Etna, iO serves up heartier but no less authentic Italian food in a laidback, rustic setting within HillV2. This place is perfect for longtime couples looking to enjoy the food and each others\' company. Decked out in wood and copper to resemble a traditional Italian tavern, the food, too, is comforting. Get the Porchetta ($16) to share — the crackling on the pork belly is spot-on, and we love the aromatic wild fennel stuffing. For mains, you won\'t go wrong with their pastas or risotto — the Homemade Raviolacci with Beef and Marsala Sauce ($16) and Slow-Braised Lamb Ragout Garganelli ($19) are favourites. Wines start from a reasonable $10/glass. You must end off with the Pistachio Tiramisu in a Jar ($10), a truly delightful spin on the dessert classic.\n<br />Avg Price: $45 per couple (without drinks)\n<br />Photo by Burpple Tastemaker Julius Lim
I guess this will suffice. Seared tuna on the daily specials at #ioitalianosteria last sunday. Perfectly seared tuna served on a bed of tangy shaved cucumbers. 😋 Happy Lunar New Year everyone! #burpple #searedtuna #italianfood
Who said size doesn\'t matter?\n<br />.\n<br />The Big Size Burrata (S$38++) is one of the chef\'s specials at iO Italian Osteria. The sheer size of the burrata doesn\'t compromise on the pudgy texture and the flavour is robust. There were loads of stringy Parma ham and rocket leaves that the dish is more than enough for four!
Shows that this year I\'ll be blessed w more good food. 😋\n<br />🍴\n<br />The texture is almost udon like but slightly springier than udon. Then imagine it in a seafood base sauce 🤤\n<br />🍴\n<br />#burpple #italianfood #pasta #italianosteria
I ordered the baked lasagne for $18 (bef gst), cooked in \"Grandma\'s style\", which made me imagine the hands behind this dish belonged to a nice wrinkly grandma doing what grandmas do best — splurge on the ingredients and salt. 
And they taste so good with the crusty pizza base and generous amount of toppings 😋. 🔅 \n<br />Reservations for dinner especially is highly recommended! 🔅\n<br />☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻☻\n<br />😋iO Italian Osteria\n<br />💰$22\n<br />🍴4 Hillview Rise #02-01 HillV2 Singapore 667979\n<br />⏲Opening Hours: Daily 10AM-10PM
Wish my own kittie could produce these cheesy beauties.. 🍕😍 / the pizzas look rather thick but they were actually really crusty and airy! Would liked to have for more flavour variations though 😋 \n<br />Those who like your pizza with fluffy chewy layers – similar to sourdough 🍞, this is meant for you. #italian #pizza🍕🍕🍕#doneright #ootd✔️ #burpple
One of their specials. The tuna is cooked to the right texture, mixed with olives, baby tomatoes, capers and butter sauce. Highly recommend! 👍🏻
The cream stuffings are almost cloud-like yet not overly sweet or jelat. Chocolate lovers should go for their uber fluffy dark chocolate bread - really really soft and airy! \n<br />Already waiting for the next time to bite into this superb doughnuts!
Although it\'s located in Hillview, Italian Osteria was packed despite it being a weekday night. Funnily, the one thing that stood out was how aromatic the olive oil was, and true to Italian cooking, everything waa drenched in this tasty tasty stuff. Also, even non-bread eating people like myself swooned over their loafs, baked in-house - so good we bought some back home!
In love with this gorgeous looking dish - The Pumpkin Risotto with Braised Duck ($32), a weekly special from @italianosteriasg. \n<br />The price might be on the higher side but oh so well worth it! Personally not a fan of pumpkin but the sweetness of the pumpkin flavour made me so addicted to it! Accompanied with interesting stir fried pepper elevated the flavours of the risotto.
Definitely a must order for those who love a good crackling pork done superbly well, tender meat and surprising me with their so so flavourful wild fennel stuffings. The matching sauce of mustard was left uncared for as the star itself was good enough to have a solo. \n<br />Thanks to fellow foodie @juliuslim who was so adamant about travelling to eat here, cause boy it was a long long journey to the far west (but oh so worth it!).
With the undying love for risotto, @rainraineeataway can\'t possible pass up the opportunity to not order this Pumpkin Risotto with Smoked Duck and Deep Fried Double Pepper ($32), especially since it was highly recommended by the server. The arborio rice was cooked al dente style and was perfectly complemented with the fresh pumpkin sauce that brought a sweet and uplifting flavour. The smoked duck gave it a savory balance while the spices when mixed together, hit a home run.
Additionally, iO has a more casual setting compared to the fine-dining ambience in Etna. One thing remains constant between both restaurants for sure, which is to respect the Italian cuisine with quality ingredients and deliver a punch of flavours. Take for example the massively popular Porchetta ($16), a baked pork belly stuffed with wild fennel and served with crispy skin, is something that I highly recommend you to order when you are here. Till date, this place has been one of my top Italian restaurants in Singapore even though it\'s situated in a far far away place from where I stay.
Traditional Roman Schiacciata\n<br />($7++ plain/$18++ stuffed)
Homemade Tagliolini, Prawns, Lemon, Aromatic Breadcrumb ($22++)
Assorted Pizzas ($29++ for 4 types)
Sure ended my day on a sweet note!☺️ This was like a Black Forest cake made w mascarpone and has a secret layer of peanut butter/ mars layer. 😋😋 #burpple #cake #tgif
A traditional Italian snack, the Sicilian Cannoli comes piped with Ricotta Cream. Yet another one of the cheesy dishes that leaves you wanting for me, the piping cream was fluffy as one would expect Ricotta to be, but lightly sweet and flavoured with a little orange zest for a zingy touch. The pastry skin is pretty similar to curry puff pastry, while the ends of the Sicilian Cannoli is sprinkled with pistachio for a slightly salted flavour and chocolate buttons for a sweeter mix of flavours.
People usually order pasta here, but our recent love for risotto made us order the baked risotto here. Presented as though it was chunks of meat, the risotto comes packed in a roll sliced into several parts. Inside, the rice was of a decent texture; not too wet not too dry while drenched in a bolognese sauce with minced meat covered in melted cheese. Despite the composition of the ingredients, the flavours are just right — tangy and cheesy but never once overwhelming, with bits of meat giving it a savoury flavour with a little bite once in a while. Portion might seem a little scary, but I guess it was how it tasted made it rather manageable. Would say that I would order a pasta the next time I am here (after all, that seemed like the main point of others visiting this place), but this dish was one that I didn\'t regret trying and is actually executed pretty well!
Homemade Raviolacci stuffed with beef in Masala sauce. ($22) The raviolacci was decent; it came with four pieces but each was pretty big in size. But it\'s the masala sauce that complements the beef really well, and each spoonful leaves me wanting more and more 😍
This is one for the truffle lovers. Stuffed with generous amounts of cheese and a truffle-infused mushroom mixture between two layers of crisp flatbread, this appetiser will definitely fill you up. (It would be just nice with a company of four as it came with 4 slices!) The  filling is packed with a strong truffle flavours and combination of cheese and truffle is simply heaven-sent 👼🏻 A must-order at iO! ($18)
Slow braised till tender. Heart warming w every bite ☺️. Brought my parents to my fav @italianosteriasg to have an early Father\'s Day celebration. (Since I\'ll be in Korea next weekend🙊) #burpple #italianfood #pasta
Went for late lunch on a Saturday. Didn\'t make reservations cos I didn\'t think I would need to. Wrong! They were almost full house so I had to sit at the bar. Surprisingly quite comfy. Almost half of the customers were ang mo. Staff too. Beautifully decorated with a distinct ang mo vibe. A wonderful place to spend a rainy afternoon. Very friendly staff. Their service was excellent. This stuffed traditional Roman schiacciata (truffles) is a must order! Crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, I couldn\'t stop stuffing my mouth even thou I burnt my tongue. Truffle taste was strong with melty creamy cheese. Tasted just as good after heating up in the toaster the next day for breakfast. The orecchiette pork sausage saffron sauce was creamy and luscious. It had a little spicy kick which perked me right up. I need to go back again. And again. And again. Wish they will open another branch in a more central location. 
Open by Italians, run by Italians and cook by Italians, you can most certainly feel the passion and love they put into the restaurant’s décor and food. Besides the traditional roman schiacciata that has been stuffed with mascarpone cheese and truffles, another must order starter is the Porchetta ($14); a baked pork belly stuffed with wild fennel. If you are a fan of our Chinese roasted pork (sio bak), you will fall madly in love with this. The crackling pork skin, melts-in-your-mouth pork belly and the saltiness from the wild fennel will surely make you a happy diner.
This Orecchiette with Pork Sausage and Saffron sauce ($18) was light on the palate considering it\'s a cream-based pasta. The kitchen are run by Italian chefs and some of the service crews are Italians too. 🇮🇹🇮🇹🇮🇹
I\'m not really into basic just cheese pizza so I asked if they could have a mushroom pizza instead. The waiter very kindly said he would add mushrooms on my cheese pizza order. Although the mushroom cheese pizza wasn\'t the most stellar dish, it\'s still quite nice to order (since it balances out everything else here that is super rich and flavourful.) 
If you really love carbs and bread and you\'re into thick crusted pizza made of flavourful, fresh ingredients you will LOVE THIS. Probably my favourite item after the Roman Schiacciata (for savoury items). Super garlicky and wholesome. If I could buy their pizza base by the bulk I would. 
Words cannot fathom how much I have raved and loved this dish. I have eaten this every single time I have came here (and trust me I come here enough to have tried almost all their desserts HAHAHA) This is a MUST to order and if you love truffle, mushrooms and cheese and really awesome bread - you will LOVE this. 
Handcut potato fries which were more mushy rather than crispy (if you\'re into that). Really flavourful tho, but I like my fries either super crispy or nice and soggy.
I never edit my photos - so everything is just with natural lighting! Pictured here is their lemon bar, which is much more manageable to eat than their lemon meringue (since the lemon meringue can get really sweet and cloying after awhile) and also a whole lot cheaper. Wished there was a more hard graham cracker crust tho! 
A recommendation by fellow Tastemaker @nillyfelt brought my friends and I to the west in search of good pasta, and we left being satisfied with more than that. Despite being in a location unchartered for some locals (none of us had even heard of HillV2), the place was absolutely buzzing! I count myself extremely lucky to be able to secure a table without booking a reservation (don’t make the same mistake, call!), thanks to the help of the friendly and accommodating hostess.
Pistachio cake (made will real pistachios) and espresso ice-cream as a after dinner treat in order to fatten up my brother before he flies off! :) the espresso ice cream was seriously strong and good (I think it\'s homemade? I forgot to ask!) but the pistachio cake was seriously the bomb, being such a flavourful dense cake. My only gripe is how for 16 dollars (excluding GST and service charge) they only give two thin measly slices. :( more please!!
This is seriously steep for its size ($10) , but I\'ve never found pistachio tiramisu anywhere else, and they  make such a well-balanced tiramisu - how can one resist?! So yes, I order this almost EVERYTIME I\'m here 😅 And also because tiramisu is my mom\'s favourite dessert hehe
Super rich and overloaded in taste. I don\'t really like cakes that have alcohol in them (but this was really good) I really love the hazelnut core in the middle, tastes like homemade Nutella. 
Asked for all vegetarian assorted pizzas, but J did try the garlic one before (which is really good) but never did I try the one piled with cheese. The garlic one still tastes better in my opinion tho. I love the crust of the pizza! Chewy and soft, seriously bomb. Sadly the service here is really deteriorating drastically, which is strange considering how much you pay for service charge here. 
it was better the first time I ate this- probably because this time it isn\'t that burnt and crispy!! But still v YUMZ 
Wowza! This was the highlight of our meal. Think roti John, but better than any John out there. Perfectly toasted bread that\'s just the right texture, crispy on the outside but not enough to cut your hard palate, and chewy on the inside but not dense till the point of badly done thick-crust pizzas. Oh boy what a mouthful, but doesn\'t beat the mouthful of flavours that will delight your tastebuds with every bite you take. Don\'t worry, your eyes won\'t be left out- dat ooze doe. Evidently, my photo doesn\'t do it justice. Stuffed with (cream?) cheese and mushrooms, drizzled with truffle oil (too bad not the real deal, but not complaining tbh), this dish will be bringing me back for more. 
The dishes I ordered here were so heart-stopping and delicious, I found my favourite new comfort food! The Roman Schiacciata was stuffed with ricotta cheese, truffle oil and mushroom, and it was so delicious it was unreal. (Not sure if it was real truffle oil though.) Vegetarian tomato pizza was also well seasoned with garlic, and thus both dishes were very, very rich on the palate. Truly real deal comfort food, or a yummy cheat meal right here. Can\'t wait to be back again! Also a big shout out to the wonderful server we had here, (didn\'t manage to get his name) but he has blonde hair and was extremely friendly and courteous. 
If you know me, I absolutely love anything lemon, and I gravitate towards buying anything lemon flavoured. Although this lemon meringue was on the pricier side, ($12) it was quite a large portion! It tastes just like a traditionally good lemon meringue, but it can be a tad bit sweeter. Do share because it\'s big and quite sweet! At the same time share the love for dessert! 🍋 = ❤️
It\'s actually a Roman Schiacciata, which is stuffed with cheese and truffled mushrooms. I like how the bread is baked with a smoky flavour. Truffle fragrance is strong too, but can\'t expect them to use real truffles at only S$16++ for this starter.
IO Italian Osteria looks like a traditional Italian place that serves honest Italian cuisine. Dishes feels authentic, unpretentious and homemade. Would love to be back for a few more times to try the other dishes, such as the porcetta which was not available that evening.
Cognac flambé prawns garlic sauce polenta for one of their Boxing Day special. Best decision made today. The garlic sauce was soooooooo good 😋😋😋 went well with the pistachio(I think?) and black pepper dusting! #burpple
Assorted pizza, really delicious! However the cashier/ lady boss spoilt the entire experience. Firstly we reserved for a table online and the following day they called to modify our timing (earlier). We came on time but were told our timing was not changed and they do not have a table available, if we do not want to wait, we can go. Really rude of the lady boss. And when our table was ready, she told us we only had 2 hours to dine and went off (luckily it was more than enough). But she was just too rude. 
Nowadays you can barely get a seat here if you didn\'t make reservations beforehand. Love the homely Italian food that you can get here. Only downside is that you go home smelling like BBQ. Got one of their specials today. Semolina pasta with monkfish. The small little semolina pasta had the texture of cooked barley and it was really tasty with the mashed monkfish! The tomatoes and pickled onions made the dish refreshing and balanced as well! Yum #burpple
very authentic and especially cheap for italian fine dining to be honest. the chefs cooking in the open kitchen are all super hot too hahahah desserts are a must try!! especially the chocolate lava cake
Chose this from the daily specials menu. Pork tenderloin stuffed w figs and prunes and laid over a bed of mashed potatoes. Christmas came early. It tasted very christmasy because of the figs and prunes. Would probably be better if they had chose either fruit to stuff it rather than both. 
Not sure if this is common in Italian cuisine but it was the first time I heard of it. Was even more intrigued when it came like little patties bubbling in a clay pot. There are 4 risotto parties in a cheesy and tomato-y sauce. Although it doesn\'t look like it, it was actually quite meaty! You get a mouthful of bolognese everytime you eat a spoonful. So basically, this is like a lasagna but more shiok and less gelard. It is also more filling. I can imagine this being my comfort food..
A very traditional Italian antipasti. This was made with aged angus beef. The thickness(or rather thinness) is just nice to still give a bite when you chew on it. It went well w the olive oil, rockets and Parmesan. 
It might not look like a lot but it is definitely filling (especially after the starters). The beef is so tender that you don\'t need a knife to cut through, just use a fork to flake the meat apart. However because it is only beef and potatoes, it can be a little gelard.
I love the crust! Thin but not paper thin, it still has some chewiness. All the flavours were great! Think I\'ll be dreaming of this tonight.
This was a good starter. Soft calamari w pesto sauce that has a slight spicy kick.
The O List
Back at my bf\'s family favourite place. I love how everytime you come here, they have different specials. Decided to try their tuna loin special as I have a thing for tuna. I love the sesame crust, though a tad salty. I must say italian tuna steak is not as soft as japanese tuna, but nevertheless still good! 
First time I ever tried anything like this and I love it! Rose cake(which is really caked dipped in Alchermes, an italian herb liqueur that is red in colour and tasted like rose to me) with savoiardi fingers and layered with custard and chocolate then encrusted in a meringue finish. 😋😋😋 Their popular hazelnut puffs and salted caramel pana cotta are in the background.
Ordered today\'s special. Fresh tender sea bass that\'s slightly crisp on the exterior, on top of a smooth creamy potato mash. ☺️ 
Love the richness and smoothness of the ricotta and the wonderful tart base. Would have preferred fewer chocolate chips though. They have a different selection of desserts daily!
This place is perfect for date nights. :) Although the steak was a little oily, the taste was perfect! The fettuccine was perfectly al dente and the sauce was really crabby! It was almost like chilli crab!
The salted caramel was quite good but the panna cotta was a little too soft. The hazelnut creme was really good ☺️
And the porcetta was a huge bonus! Spanks @felkhoo for the intro! :D
It was unique, perhaps because it\'s my first time having Orrechiette. Pleasant, but a bit salty toward the end :) awesome ambience too!
Excellent grade of beef cooked medium rare, topped with shaven Parmesan, with a side of arugula and fresh tomatoes with pesto are winning combinations, resulting in this perfect dish. I was in heaven- who knew beef and cheese could go so well together? Second time here and looking forward to my next visit again. 
iO Italian Osteria offers great Italian food in an extremely casual chic setting. With an open kitchen, open ceiling with hipster hanging lights and unpretentious wooden furnishings, this new restaurant basks in natural light from large side windows, providing diners with the ultimate chill ambience. Food is prepared from scratch using fresh high quality ingredients. Find anything from fresh bread baked in-house, plates of Italian street food, pastas, anti-pastas, and mains - which include options like the grilled US rib-eye and codfish in aromatic fish broth. Get some wine to accompany that, and don\'t forget dessert. Some tiramisu, perhaps?
West siders rejoice! 🎉 This charming, rustic, authentic Italian restaurant sits on the second level of the newly opened HillV2. Upon entering, I was awed by the ambience, furnitures and up till the heavy copper utensils that I was contemplating to shamelessly ask whether I could bring one set home, but obviously I didn\'t 😂 A couple of the staff there are Italians - extra cheese points! We ordered bruschetta with cooked ham and stracchino cheese, pizza with parma ham and rocket leaves, crispy golden seafood in semonila crumb, baked eggplant parmigiana and slow-braised lamb ragout gracchiette. They were all equally delicious, each with its own distinct flavour, but I enjoyed the lamb ragout pasta and the baked eggplant best! I\'m looking forward to my next meal there and that includes trying one of my favourite Italian dessert: cannoli. One word to describe this place: Fantastico! 
iO was packed to the brim for lunch today, and boy were we not disappointed! Had the crispy pork belly, succulent meatballs, grilled calamari and seafood platter. A fantastic Italian haunt with a wide selection beyond the simple pizza or pasta. 💯💯💯 #igsg #sgig #instaeats #sgeats #igeats #instafood #sgfoodies #sgfoodie #igfoodies #igfood #western #wheretoeat #8dayseat #darzieeats #burpple #burpplesg #chopesg #froth #ascott
This isn\'t on the main menu, do ask for the traditional pasta menu when you are there.
.\n<br /> My favorite was the unique and very tasty homemade stuffed schiacitta that was crisp yet dense bread filled with melted cheese and truffle. The pork belly was amazingly tender and the skin was very crisp (imagine that wonderful crackling sound when cut) altho certain parts were not as crispy and stuck to our teeth (:/). The stuffing of wild fennel vegetables added extra flavor to the meat, making it a highly enjoyable dish. Also enjoyed the prawn pasta with its tasty savory tomato sauce and smooth, creamy #bruschetta with fresh rockets and tomato. The #pistachiotiramisu was unique and very creamy with rich rum flavor but the pistachio flavor wasn’t very strong. The only let down dish was the #beefcarpaccio that was cut a bit too thick making it a bit too chewy.\n<br />📍@ioosteria, #02-01 HillV2, No 4 Hillview Rise
Cheese, sausage, mushrooms
Not that it means much …. but iO Italian Osteria’s Porchetta [$9 small/ $18 large] certainly has both my picky mother’s and my stamp of approval. Perfectly crisp and delightfully fatty, the baked pork belly stuffed with wild fennels didn’t disappoint at all. The crusty, crackled layer being the highlight for me; the sound as the server cut through the golden crackling was pure foodgasm even before tasting it. And after a bite, the taste and textures proved to be as good as it looks. Of course, the herb enhanced slab was succulent, savoury and nicely seasoned with an even hit of pepper.Served with a side of spicy mustard, the dip also added an extra punch of flavour to the meat though just great on its own, I had most of mine without.
not the most impressive freshness but pomegranate and olives did throw a refreshing burst of flavors.\n<br />.\n<br />#burpplesg #burpple #foodie #foodart #foodstagram #foodphoto #foodphotography #foodcoma #igsg #instafood #ioitalianosteriasg #foodpornsg #sgfoodie #instafoodsg #instafood_sg #igsgfood #sgfood #singaporefood #sgdining #restaurantsg #sgrestaurants
🥄\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; TIPS💮: Absolutely no idea why one would baked a Risotto. It looked like a Meatloaf more than a Risotto. The texture of the rice is way off than what one would expect, so skip this. 🧀\n<br />.\n<br />We tried most of the pastas they have to offer, from fresh pasta to risotto, surprisingly the pastas here are not up to par.

🥄\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; GTK💮: The phenomenally radioactive neon yellow Saffron sauce...

Though looking plain and dull, the al dente orecchiette was beautifully coated in saffron \'sauce\'. The subtle spice flavour was made more addictive with the addition of cheese and black pepper.

🍝\n<br />•\n<br />ACAMASEATS &amp; TIPS💮: Of all the Pasta we had this gotta be the most decent out of all. Scrumptious sauce, delightful prawns &amp; umami tomatoes. The only downside will be the Homemade Tagliolini itself. It could be more Al Dente. 🔖\n<br />.\n<br />Deep down in my heart I just wanna an authentic plate of Cacio e Pepe most uniquely Roman of pastas. Just three ingredients, pasta, pepper &amp; cheese. So simple, so good but so many places get it wrong or doesn\'t serve it. There\'s no sauce to hide behind, one can judge an Osteria simply by ordering that humble pasta. 🖖🏻\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />.\n<br />#fooddiary #foreverhungry #foodiegram #sgfoodie #foodiesg #foodsg #burpproved #burpplesg #burppletastemaker #TheNewHealthy #huffposttaste #f52grams #8dayseat #STFoodTrending #ChopeSG #iOItalianOsteriaSG #iOItalianOsteria #tagliolini #pasta #osteria #italian #cacioepepe

One must order dish has got to be the Porchetta ($9/$19), a baked pork belly stuffed with wild fennels.

With @juliuslim\'s introduction, we ordered the Porchetta ($9 for small, $18 for large). Stuffed with wild fennel &amp; baked till crisp, the porchetta is the perfect starter for every pork lover out there. \n<br />The skin of the pork belly was so crisp, I could just do with having pork belly skin as crackers instead. •\n<br />#aroundwithamd #Burpple #BurppleSG #BurppleTastemaker #ForeverHungry #Burpproved #whatI8today #8dayseat #tslmakan #openricesg #eatoutsg #citynomads #asiafoodprn #foodstagram #instafood #instasg #sgfoodie #sgfoodiary #instafood_sg #fdprn #exploresg #sgfoodstagram #sgeats #sgig #vscofood #foodphotography #singaporeinsiders #STFoodTrending #WeekenderSG

The Porchetta is so caramelized and so crackling! The traditional stuffed Roman Schiacciata filled with gooeey creamy truffle mushroom and crispy crust is absolutely amazing! \n<br />The food here were generous, absolutely divine and affordable! Not forgetting they have at least Italian chefs, lots of hot Italian waiters, I\'m already planning to visit again! \n<br />#sgeats #sgfoodie #ioitalianosteria #tgif #burpple #sg #instafood
Bolognese base with melted cheese, only $16!

Always wanted to try this place. Service is impeccable, and it feels like another country with the open kitchen. I ordered the ravioli with marsala wine sauce and it was pretty sweet, which scared me off haha. Other mains are really worth a try though!
Authentic Italian Cuisine. Delicious and good ambient.
Truffled to perfection, simple yet leaves you craving for more

It\'s like Disneyland where all the magic happens once this was served. Baked in-house and prepared upon order, the Traditional Roman Schiacciata ($18, stuffed) is absolutely divine, especially with the generous spread of mascarpone cheese and truffles in it. No words can describe how great this is, you just gotta try it for yourself.

Probably one of the best renditions of roast pork I have ever had. Delightfully fatty, the pork belly comes stuffed with leek and peppers for a better flavour. Thoroughly enjoyed the crusty and crispy skin, tender and gelatinous fatty meat that gives its a good bite with savoury, peppery flavours, not to mention the sheer size it comes in at $14 (it\'s relatively thickly-cut for a starter). Definitely worth making a visit down for.
A delicious mix of textures that was almost too pretty to eat.
Super delicious dessert topped with vanilla ice-cream
My brother was literally mopping up the sauce for this dish because he kept saying how light yet creamy the cheese sauce was. It baffled it how they made it taste so good and well balanced. Despite all the good food, the server mixed up our orders (twice) and we had to wait almost 15mins before someone came to take our order (this was after my Mother had stated to the waitress that she was ready to order, and we saw other people being served before us, even though we had arrived first and sat down.) I seriously wish the service becomes better. :(
Crispy, crackled pork belly which my family really enjoyed (I didn\'t eat it, but they told me it was really good.) I did however, try the accompanying mustard sauce which was seriously one of the best mustard sauces I have ever eaten. (It\'s even better than the one my sister brought back from Europe, which was freshly made by a mill - which says a lot.)
The only time we truly appreciate \'thunder thighs\'
I so can \"taste\" them now! soft meats between crackling skin!

And I\'m wishing it was Fry-day already... {Golden Seafood in Semolina Crumb} from @ItalianOsteriaSG to take away the Monday blues
and all I\'m craving for is this simple yet hearty {Orecchiette with pork sausage and saffron sauce}.. Nothing quite like anything I\'ve ever tasted but oh so tasty. Pasta may border on being just a little bit too al-dente for some but apparently that\'s how the Italians eat it
whatever this is, anything that\'s got choc + hazelnuts make for a wonderful dessert in my books! \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats @sgfoodie @singaporeeats  @italianosteriasg #italianosteriasg #italian #dessert #chocolate #hazelnut
That crunch 😄... be warned that portion sizes are ridiculously large (don\'t know why I\'m complaining) so grab some partners and dosey doe
they were G.O.O.D 👍🏼 freshly made in-house, they were so soft, I would have had that whole damn thing by myself if my tummy wasn\'t already bursting! another must-have is the Pistachio Tiramisu in a jar. yes, you read right. it\'s Pistachio. there\'s so much stuff in there, your tongue would be like a circus in tastes and textures! \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats @sgfoodie @singaporeeats  @italianosteriasg #italianosteriasg #italian #dessert #chocolate #tiramisu #donut #doughnut #custardbun #cake #latergram

oh gawd. there was SO MUCH FOOD and not enough tummy space (I haven\'t even gotten to the desserts yet 😧) but still, it doesn\'t stop me from trying everything on this plate. fish well-marinated and the squid, although chewy, wasn\'t tough at all!

I have never quite tasted anything as good as these. the aroma of the truffle and bread leaves you confused cos you wouldn\'t know which one you prefer more. grab these with your fingers (lady boss, Anna insists that\'s the only way you should eat them, not with 🍴) and feel the stuffings literally oooooze out. if and when they fall on your plate, you\'d naturally use the bread to scoop them up again so there\'s zero wastage here on the good stuff. great. just thinking about this makes me want to have more NOW 😣
I\'m not even a big fan of olives but these green olives definitely won me over with their blend of sour and savoury \n<br />@igsg #igsg #singapore #foodpornasia #burpple #setheats #eatoutsg #sgfood #foodsg #sgfoodie #singaporeeats @sgfoodie @singaporeeats  @italianosteriasg #italianosteriasg #italian #olives #stuffedolives

How about freshly baked bread? Lol.

Panettone filled with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce :)
Right dere... did I mention there\'s chunks of soft white chocolate in there, amidst fluffy clouds of mascarpone mixture?～ What\'s not to like？
🙃Oozing with succulent juices, the insides of the roulade flavored by baked wild fennel; and more importantly, the skin as crispy as a wafer without an inkling of that gummy effect - I wasn\'t complaining at all。
Sio bak ftw😁

One of their specials today. This was done really well. Swordfish grilled medium rare. Although I don\'t know what\'s the red sauce, it was quite nice w that sauce and tabasco. As for the side salad, it\'s a mixture of pickled onions which only serves to clear the palate.
Literally a cup of melted chocolate bar. It was thick, smooth and of course as chocolatey as it could get! Choice of hot or cold. 
Pastas came in huge servings but I think sharing for these would be better. Both got a little jelak after awhile! 
Very authentic italian food and the italian atmoaphere! Doing some takeaway of their amazing cookies! This gotta be one of the best cookies I ever had!
Pork belly with wild fennel. Just a little indulgent on Sunday night. Meat was really tender and flavourful. Only gripe was that the skin though crisp was a little sticky. Guess it can\'t be avoided, since they can\'t freshly fry each serving, as they fry the whole roll of pork tgt.
Rocket leaves, Parma ham, cherry tomatoes and mozarella cheese. 😋😋
Delish! Everything on this plate is so fresh
