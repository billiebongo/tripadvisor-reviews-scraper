One of my favorite item of the evening! Uni on top of ikura and Japanese sushi rice. It\'s creamy uni with a burst of briny ikura that coated the plump Japanese rice all in a single mouthful. And you know I can\'t resist dainty looking food, sometimes I just want to bring them home 😅
This roll is worthy of being their signature dish. Although no indulgent ingredients are used, this roll heated up the evening with its spicy maguro and a special chilli sauce created by Chef Ethan. It is then topped with fresh onion sprouts which is also sharp in flavour.\n<br />🔸\n<br />This is taken during an invited tasting.
Had a cocktail prepared by mixologist Adrian from Fort last evening. I don\'t remember seeing a menu, but Adrian asked me a series of questions before heading off to prepare my drink. He came back with one made from watermelon with gin and vodka and a dash of basil. This results in a cocktail that is exactly what I like - sweet and refreshing.

Well.. I just pointed to the stalks of ginger flower.. wonder if anything could be concocted.. and I was smitten by this awesome tickler.. a hint of spice.. nicely blended with house infused vodka (cherry or strawberry, sorry guys)... dash of \"something\" (ingredients in fine print.. but it looked potent..).. and the omakase was good value too...

.\n<br />And this Otoro sushi 🍣 is part of the course. Here food served are Japanese style with an Asian twist and the Omakase menu changes weekly, ensuring a fresh look and anticipation among diners.\n<br />.\n<br />Fort accommodates 24 pax by-the-bar seatings where you get the most experience out of watching mixologist whips up cocktails 🍸and striving up conversations with the ever-chatty Jane , chefs and Mixologist Matteo. Here, there\'s no barriers; everyone is treated like family. Really great time spent, go with an open mind and you never know who you are gonna meet! 😻
Gonna be posting some as and when, including photos of the amazing cocktails and Omakase!.\n<br />👉Turn up volume for sound effects!\n<br />📽Anyway, besides aesthetic purposes (the \'fog\' looks so cool 😄), who would have expected a bar to own equipments to make their own dry ice!
Cozy setting makes this place perfect for a date. Get high on their unique &amp; interesting cocktails 🍸☠🍹😍
Was there a while back, and only managed to write review. Love the ambience, hidden inside the park. Cocktail pairing is an absolute delight, along with the passion for the bar counter! Worth the visit notwithstanding the price tag.
Innovation / Creativity / Passion - all you want from a top cocktail bar!
We tried the $68 12-course omakase but I would say the food was just average. Highlights for me were the oyster (very fresh, didn\'t need the ikura topping), the yakitori chicken skewers and the mini lamb sliders. What I *would* come back for is the bespoke cocktails, which were served up by Mateo, our very skilled bartender who truly has a passion for his craft. Thanks Mateo, for making our dinner that much more enjoyable with the fun conversation! :)
In this hand-rolled maki, you find it to be slightly spicy as maguro (tuna) are lightly lined with wasabi and decorated with specially imported onion sprouts.
If you\'re a fan of Maison Ikkoku\'s cocktails, you\'re going to swoon over their latest concept housed in the Pinacothèque De Paris, right in the heart of Fort Canning Park\'s lush grounds. While most make the trek to this unexpected hideout for its underground vibe (think copper pipes, filament bulbs and velvet curtains) and excellent cocktails, the value-for-money, 12-course omakase set ($68) is its best kept secret, and just the thing for an intimate date night. The selection offers foolproof dishes that are also available on the à la carte menu such as The Sea ($38, à la carte), an indulgent starter of Hokkaido scallops, ikura and tobiko, as well as The Nest ($28, à la carte), a parmigiano-reggiano and mozzarella custard. For the complete experience, opt for the cocktail pairing (from $18, available for every dish) and imbibe on Maison Ikkoku\'s bespoke tipples. The pairings are all well thought out — for example, the marvellous whisky-based \'Antibiotic\', infused with young ginger and smoke (using Jack Daniel\'s wood chips), goes seamlessly well with The Nest\'s rich flavours. 
Liked the surprise chewy mozzarella bits in this Parmigiano-Reggiano and mozzarella custard, but loved its complementary bourbon-based \'Antibiotic\' cocktail ($26) more, infused with young ginger and smoke (using Jack Daniel\'s wood chips). 
It was then finished off with a dash of Himalayan salt to add a greater depth. The sweetest cocktail of all, which was beautifully balanced with a smooth and lingering finish!
Cubes of roast goose and beet placed upon mashed sweet potato laced with kaffir lime, tantalising our tastebuds with different texture and flavours. Enjoy this dish together with 珠光宝气 aka Bejewelled Radiance, that has daisy caviar in the bubbly champagne.
As part of Chinese New Year menu, they have developed a 4-course CNY Menu available from 1 Jan to 29 Feb 2016 at only $48++ per pax! It also offers cocktail pairing for each course at an additional of $40++ per pax!\n<br />The highlight of all was Sea of Fortune, 年年有余 because fish is always the star when it comes to CNY dishes. The salmon steak was topped with a slap of briny salmon roe and laid on passion fruit sauce. They also included the seeds of the passion fruit that was unique, as the crunchiness of the seeds will tempt your taste buds. Sweetness of the fruity sauce was also complemented with thin slices of green apple and graperfruit. \n<br />This is paired with Opulent Prosperity, 招財進寶 with a whiskey base, biters and sprinkle of citrus sugar, seemingly similar to Old Fashioned. Love the citrus sugar that further smoothened the whiskey!\n<br />Thank you @maisonikkoku and @wom_sgpr for the hosted meal and @cassakating for the extension!\n<br />Find out more from the link in my profile!
Crunchy green apple slices and passionfruit brought a twist to this dish as the tangy sauce balance out the briny salmon roe.
Love the vibe, the pretty plates and bespoke cocktails, all meant to provide you with a sensory dining experience. Review up on www.ms-skinnyfat.com Active link in bio! So so need a drink right now. Thanks to @ethanleslieleong for having me. #fortbymi
Made of whiskey, young ginger, lemongrass and oak chip smoke, you\'ll smell the \"poisonous\" gas before sipping the spiced smokey drink. Warning: there are different \"side effects\" so read what your label says.
During this festive season, they came up with a three-course menu that uses iconic ingredients of Christmas, bringing happiness to us. Cocktail pairing (additional $20++) is also available whereby you\'ll try two unique cocktails.
Antibiotic was my favorite drink at FORT by Maison Ikkoku. This Whisky Sour is smoked with oak wood chips. It smelled really poisonous and it\'s super potent with heat from the young ginger but oh it made me so happy. 😍 love the vibe of the bar. Look out for the other food pics later!
If you\'re a fan of Maison Ikkoku\'s cocktails, then you\'re gonna swoon over their newest concept housed in the Pinacothèque De Paris smack in the heart of Fort Canning Park\'s lush grounds. While the tipples at Kandahar are more playful and experimental, look forward to more refined concoctions at this establishment, as well as a more sophisticated interior with touches of copper pipes, filament bulbs and velvet curtains. Considering the bar doubles up as a humble “kitchen,” they dish out surprisingly delectable nosh (including a 12-course omakase for only $68) that are, more than good enough for an intimate date night. Must-order dishes include The Sea ($38) — an indulgent starter comprising Hokkaido scallops, ikura and tobiko, as well as The Nest ($28) – a Parmigiano Reggiano and mozzarella custard. Be sure to opt for the cocktail pairing for the latter, as the whisky-based \'Antibiotic\' infused with young ginger and smoke (using Jack Daniel\'s wood chips) is absolutely tipplelicious. 
It might be a short walk away from anything, but the space is perfect for intimate gatherings over some delicious cocktails.
Crunchy, spicy with a succulent kick. Everything packed within this roll is bound to make you gush with excitement!
Did you know that you could get a 3 course set dinner from Fort by @maisonikkoku at just $38++? And add on $20 for their cocktail pairing. Trust me, it\'s worth it because I would personally pay $38++ for their sous vide, truffle coated turkey which would be part of the menu as well.\n<br />.\n<br />🚇Dhoby Ghaut. Pinacotheque de Paris, 5 Cox Terrace, Fort Canning Hill, S179620.
Tucked away in Fort Canning Hill, in the Pinacotheque De Paris, you will LOVE the ambience of this place. While you would expect the food and drinks here to be really expensive, cause ATAS PLACE, but no. THEIR NEW MENU, the 3 course festive menu (launched TODAY) will only set you back $38++ per pax! Crazy huh?
These guys really know their stuff. Can\'t wait to be back. Bespoke cocktail for $18 sounds pretty much like a great deal 😍😍😍\n<br />Thank you so much for the media invite @wom_sgpr

How I wonder what you are.\"\n<br />🔹🔹\n<br />It shimmers it glistens. It dances round and round when being stirred not shaken. A mocktail crafted to suit my tastebuds by Adrian, a talented mixologist. It is sweet, it is tangy and slurpingly refreshing.\n<br />🔹🔹\n<br />A delightful concoction during a private tasting. Cool place for gorgeous crafted bespoke cocktails.

Before this was concocted, the bartender asked what we would like. I said I want something bright and colorful whereas my friend wanted fruity and alcoholic.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />Tadah!! Vibrant fruity cocktail with splashes of gin and vodka. I do not drink alcohol but judging from the empty glass, I think my friend enjoyed it. I had my mocktail which will be posted soon.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />It was a night of good food and plentyful drinks. If you enjoy \"bespoking\", this place is just right. Away from the crowd, cozy and your cocktails will be in the hands of the friendly bartenders.
The last course of the omakase. ◾◾\n<br />A non-complicated dessert but quite chio. Torched marshmallow on a stick and engulfed in liquid nitrogen. It made me warm &amp; fuzzy watching fellow diners enjoying  dessert on a stick. Simplicity at its best.\n<br />◾◾\n<br />Thank you Jane @fortbymaisonikkoku for the invite. Woohoo.... so fun hanging out with you.
Foie Gras nigiri. Soft and alittle melty with a tinge of torched finish on the palate. 🔼🔼\n<br />We got to try the new upcoming omakase which will be launched 3rd week of November. In the coming days, I will be posting some of the courses of the omakase.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />FortbyMaisonIkkoku is a cozy restaurant with bar seats at counter. A nice concept to create friendly interaction with fellow diners and the bartenders. Thank you, Gwen @oo_foodielicious.sg  my lovely handmodel and nice meeting you.\n<br />🔼🔼\n<br />The omakase is priced at $68++. Thank you, Jane  @fortbymaisonikkoku for the invite and owner, Ethan @fortbymaisonikkoku for hosting and personally preparing the food for us. We had a great time eating and getting to know the bartenders  plus fellow diners.

If you are worried of gamy taste, you would not get that in the burger. In fact you probably would not be able to tell its made of lamb. It is a lovely burger but if it can be more cheesy, I would have love it more.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #lamb #burger
Beside appreciating the freshness of the swordfish, I was drawn to the Asian dressing. It gives the dish an oriental dimension which felt like having Cantonese style steamed fish.\n<br />.\n<br />#sgfoodonfoot #exploresingapore #sgfood #sgfoodies #whati8today #iweeklyfood #instafood_sg #foodsg #foodstagram #burpple #mediainvite #omakase #swordfish #carpaccio
