I was crazy enough to order üßÄ Cheese Ramen. Must be too tired with whole office shifting saga. Damn it\'s so so yummy though :) Very generous with their meat. Sinful!

Torimaru - rich creamy chicken ramen good for the skin
Ramen broth is a lil salty, still prefer the one a Bugis+, but I enjoy the good company and thank you soo much for the Gilla Shiki Kit from HK! \n<br />#weekend #whati8today #burpple #8dayseat #ramenchampion #butagod #beeframen #tonkotsuramen #ramen #dinner #changiairport #changiT3
Buta God Sukiyaki Ramen $13. .\n<br />Surprisingly good. Robust broth, springy ramen and fatty-licious sukuyaki pork. No wonder they are the Ramen Champion!!.\n<br />.\n<br />#chubbybotakkoala #whati8today #burpple #ramen #ramensg #ramenchampion #noodle #noodlesoup #sgjapanesefood #japanesefoodsg #igsg #igsgfood #instafood_sg #instafoodsg #changiairport #changiairportsingapore #sgig #sgigfoodies #comfortfood #hungrygowhere #openricesg #stfood #citynomads

Egg cooked to absolute perfection. Broth was amazing, unfortunately the beef was on the tough side otherwise, It\'s pretty amazing to have this on a rainy day. #ramenchampion #ramen #singapore #sgfood #sg #SGFoodies #FoodForFoodies #Foodies #Instafood #Foodstagram #Instadaily #igsg #sgig #instasg #instagramsg #foodpics #foodphotos #foodpic #foodphotography #foodplating #sgrestaurant #style #sgfoodie #foodporn #sgigfoodies #foodreviewsg #singaporeinsiders #eatoutsg #8dayseat #burpple @fansofchangi
