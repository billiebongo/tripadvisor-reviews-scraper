Had never got the chance to try out their plated desserts so went for this one. Not sure what to expect for a Tarte Tartin but this one certainly was something I liked; filo pastry which is crisp drizzled with a light sweet caramel (not sure if they used vanilla beans in there), coming with a full caramalised apple. Personally I would have preferred the apple to be softer, but the soft crunch for this one seemed to give much more dimension to the dessert somehow.
For a person who really dread burgers for carbs, this is one of the rare few that gets me excited and even to the extent of visiting them just for the burger. Prices have went up exponentially through the years from $14 to $18 now, but it also comes with more chips as a result. What got me in love from Day One when I first had it till now; the soft, fluffy bun, the homemade patty which retains its q-ness while having a crusted exterior which is delightfully crispy drenched in just the right amount of melted cheese and apple sauce for some flavour contrast. It\'s like that crush you have had in high school that you can never forget.
Tender white fish, similar to cod fish texture, I love this fish, but not this tangy mango-spice sauce.
From nowhere to go to somewhere to eat. Tagliatelle with bolognese sauce. Unique pasta, with a hint of tuffle oil, but not too much to my liking.
Affordable coffee and cake. The cakes were not too sweet but still very fragrant. Too bad they had discontinued the espresso ice cubes with milk so I settled for their white espresso. The free wifi was a huge plus! 
I love how their Banana Bread seemed to be really sweet with banana flavours and a bit of mushiness in its texture, but it\'s pretty thickly cut and quite dense too, which is a tad heavy for me as a tea time snack that was ordered to pair up with my Cold Brew.
Espresso shot frozen into ice cubes served with milk at the side; pour in the desired amount of milk and the espresso would melt into it to form something similar to iced latte, but stronger. Leave it for a while and it somehow would form a creamy consistency; pretty alike to Old Hen\'s cold brew less the sweetness. Pretty intense in its flavours, so definitely not for those who does not fancy coffee.
Brunch in the West at a place with food of East and West influence .
A rather simple loaf cake that had been served here ever since they started. It\'s moist, and comes with zesty flavours of grapefruit with a bit of tang from the yogurt. Not too bad but I would prefer their flawless Pandan Chiffon Cake any time.
Hard to get in but maybe that\'s why the ambience is saoooo goooood 
Was ok.. Crispy. Quite lightly flavored, nothing a little ketchup can\'t fix!
Something diff from the usual pancake, this is the Chinese version pancake...with dried prawn... 
Soft, fluffy bun with thick, flavourful pork patty and tangy apple sauce. The patty tastes like chorizo in patty form. The chips, seasoned with salt &amp; black pepper, were crispy and addictive. So addictive that we ordered another plate of chips to share. üòã
Plain ol\' homecooked French toast with salt and pepper. Don\'t get the hype about this place, because their brunch items aren\'t anything spectacular, and from what I\'ve heard, the coffee isn\'t consistently satisfactory either. Maybe their dinner menu is more impressive, but I\'m not at all inclined to try it. 
Espresso frozen into ice cubes &amp; diluted with cold milk. Perfect for hot days! Kudos to the person who thought of freezing espresso into ice cubes. Coffee\'s still strong even after the espresso cubes melted which is good cos no one likes diluted coffee.
Ahhh still dreaming of this incredibly rustic yet delicious pasta dish. Now, a close-up for you guys - time to feast with your eyes!
My favourite was was the summer pasta - i loved the texture of the homemade tagliatelle, which was wonderfully coated with garlic-ky, cheesy goodness, while still remaining light on the palette. And oh boy those shiso leaves were a fancy touch we both thoroughly enjoyed (kind of reminded me of Ikyu\'s chirashi). Thanks to the staff who were also so cool last night, laughing along and joking with us. What a great start to recess week.
Really good ham tempered with mild Brie and the piquant wasabi-like taste of horseradish. 
The coffee here had been rather inconsistent because of the regular change in baristas here. Today\'s cuppa was bright and cheery but at the same time robust, and also had a slight milkier feel
Its been a long time since I last set foot here and they are offering some new cakes! The cake is a bit dry, but the zingy flavour was short and sweet; not much of it lingers on the tongue but its refreshing with each bite. Walnuts add a crunch to the soft crusted top.
Tucked into a quaint neighborhood, this cafe was perfect for catching up w friends, getting work done (people brought laptops in), and reading (good reads/mags provided on the table too!) Interesting iced espresso cubes w two cute mini bottles of milk, and very soft and buttery savory (cheddar x chive) scones. Good daylight feels and food seems reasonably priced as well. 
Brunch with an old friend at the secluded little cafe in a quiet neighborhood. Not really worth the trip unless you\'re driving in. Oh the coffee\'s great though! For $5 you get to choose coffee of various sizes and how you\'d like it (black/white). 
Amazing coffee, great desserts, tucked in a secluded area, just the right amount of quiet you need to rush out that proposal or assignment! We had our share of black velvet and a good cuppa!
Pork burger with cheese and apple sauce (and a whole load of rocket that I don\'t eat). Homemade potato and tapioca crisps on the sides - love it! 
You will always know when the chef really loves food. So much flavour in the lil scones just off the oven.Thumbs up to this ulu cafe.
It\'s always refreshing when a place commits to serving simple, good quality food and drinks, and that\'s exactly what Necessary Provision does. They\'ll be featuring their signature homemade Banana Bread, perfect with a cup of joe. For something different, go for their Iced Espresso in Milk - two frozen cubes of their specially curated espresso blend topped with cold milk. This is one unique drink you won\'t want to miss!
Nestled in a quiet residential area in Bukit Timah, this cafe offers an escape from the buzz of traffic and fast-paced city life. It hosts a relaxed environment for out-of-office work or some enjoyable book-reading. Try their innovative take on iced espresso in milk, which involves frozen cubes of espresso, served with a small jar of chilled milk to pour in as you wish. 
Not much variety on a weekday morning. Expensive, considering the type of food they have. Limited seating. Average taste. Nothing to rave about here.
Yummy! Would be better if they had fresh cream to go with it. We just made do with butter so that it wasn\'t so dry and it tasted great as well. Portion was quite small though for $6. #burpple
Dropped by necessary provisions today. Ordered espresso with I forgot 5 or 6 oz of milk (you can choose the amount of milk you like). Although the coffee tasted a little bright but I still love it. Had banana and Nutella panini as well as beef pastrami, simple fare but nothing to complain about as the prices were decent. The banana cake however tasted a bit off - like it was kept in the fridge for quite some time and it had absorbed the smell of whatever was in the fridge üòñüòñ I like the pandan chiffon cake though üòÑüòÑ will definitely go back again. A little inaccessible, as we cabbed in and out of that area. 
Gooooood cofffffffeeeeee üòÑüòÑ
A for effort for the handmade pasta, and that was one sick, decadent chocolate cookie
A wee bit disappointing as the carrot cake was just too stiff and had several uneven crispy clumps that ruined the consistency of texture. Did not really taste impressive either. Should have went for the flawless Pandan Chiffon Cake instead.
11.30pm and pigging out - a very juicy and flavourful patty (though a tad salty for my liking because of the cheese) with a lovely, fluffy bun. 
A special place in the West where a small village is situated. Nice retro decos in this cafe and enjoy the ambience with a cup of ice espresso with milk.. For anyone who like to have a cup of coffee over a weekend.. 
Iced Espresso with Chilled Milk.\n<br />.
The grilled prawn pasta, though taste fine, was a little too oily. The portion wasn\'t sufficient for a meal hence ordered their banana and nutella panini (you cannot go wrong with banana and nutella combination) to make up for the unsatisfying feeling. My friends ordered bolognese spaghetti (portion was also very small) and pandan cake that was very overpriced($4 a slice). However, a huge thumbs up for their burger and coffee. I was pleasantly surprised by the way they served their tea. Very nice ambience if you want to catch up on reading or work..not too sure for the weekends though..
Very quite among the terrace houses.. Nice setup n deco of the cafe. Unique but simple menu
Yay finally i made my way here. Coffee is great! #coffee #noelw Very quiet to chill and friendly service staff!
A cup of coffee for the new year in a nice seafoam green cup in the ulu west.
Who would have guessed that in the middle of estates, there will be a cafe selling sandwiches that melts your heart. Coffee that\'s as smooth as wine.
frbucatini pasta with grilled prawn - totally enjoyed it! esh big prawns, and pasta was al dente enough soaked in fragrant garlicky oil. tad oily but i am not complaining.
this È§êËÇâËèúÁ≤íÁÇíÈ£Ø is $8 bucks a serving but worth every penny. artisan coffee making in the front juxtapose with fierce wok stirring in the background - well, the \"wok-hei\" is definitely there i say.
cafwell, there was carpenter and cook at first, now Necessary Provisions. cafe culture is definitely calling upon the west. keep coming!!
banana nutella panini. must be mad to have this at night.
white espresso
Back to basics with this plain sandwich. Tender chicken seasoned with Rosemary gives a clean taste and salad for a healthy touch.
Simple panini spread with Nutella and complimented with sliced bananas which is great for breakfast.
Pretty much unlike usual scones; smaller in size and has a savory touch with cheese and chives. Very addictive!
Coffee here is split into two categories; Black or White. Different sizes are available for both options but all charged at a flat price. The 8 Oz is probably more suitable for those who wants to give Smitten\'s blend a try (they are opened by the same group of people behind Smitten and now-defunct Henry\'s Congressional), but afraid that they may not be able to accept the intensity in flavour.
$4 might seem like too high a price for just a slice of Pandan Chiffon Cake, but its hard to believe that almost every one of their regular customers swear by their Pandan Chiffon Cake and its not difficult to see why. It packs enough flavour, and its so fluffy and light its just delightful. Try it to believe it!
Ice(d) espresso with milk. Pretty good coffee. That\'s all I have to say about this place. #burpple
Rich and smoothly dark chocolate cookie and good coffee serving here.Recommend to chocolate lover:) The best chocolate cookie I\'d ever tried :) And it\'s a good place to daze :P
Beef Pastrami, Brie and Whole Grain Mustard. Sorry, not sharing with u. Lol.
The unique coffee ($6.50) &amp; savoury scones ($5) which I don\'t really like 
Hearty sandwich with good coffee
French toast was a weekend special but was rather meh. Beef pastrami was alright.
Saturday fix a little too far from home.  Necessary Provisions has got to be the most ulu cafe for a north-eastie.  Decent coffee, milk a little too hot, but honestly not worth the long haul there .
...#onthetable: all the favorite. this sick boy needs his daily fix. üò∑
Despite mixed views on food here, the Pork Burger is a must-try. The flame-grilled patty is simply smoky and tender with complimenting apple sauce.
Fantastic iced espresso with milk on a unique bottle. Lovely place for anytime!
Pineapple Tarts from the recipe of the baker\'s mother-in-law. Melt in the mouth pastry and generously filled tarts, a great companion to coffee.
Savory scones, Beef Pastrami and Coffee.
A good weekend well spent. How about you?
love!!
i loved this! the frozen espresso ice cubes is such a neat idea
Interesting way of serving coffee... It\'s not latte or cappuccino but instead choose the amt of milk u want - 4oz 6oz 8oz :) good stuff 
The espresso comes in an ice cube form! It melts as u pour the milk over.. And love the bottle the milk comes in.. New way of drinking coffee :)
...#onthetable, cause @jontkm says he\'s REALLY hungry. | iced espresso with milk ‚Ä¢ 6oz latte ‚Ä¢ pandan chiffon cake ‚Ä¢ banana Nutella panini ‚Ä¢ beef pastrami sandwich
A genius creation of iced espresso in cubes, with milk poured in your own speed and quantity. Smaller quantities of milk and some rigorous stirring result in a deliciously strong mixture. \n<br />Customize as you please with each sip :) on the left is the \"Dark Cloud of Pure Chocolate\"- a deceptively fluffy and decadently chocolatey, its a must try! 
Bee hoon with skinny luncheon meat...beef pastrami sandwich (love the crunch of the bread) grapefruit n yoghurt cake Moroccan rose tea n a cup of mocha...verdict...really just...o...k...limited selections unexciting in fact almost boring...
Yay cafe for the westies! In my old neighborhood @karlmak #coffee #saturday #chill
This is a super hidden gem. Definitely worth a try even though its hard to find !
Tucked away in the depths of Upper Bukit Timah, Necessary Provisions is everything you\'d want from a cafe. Surreal lighting, dark walls, streaming sunlight, plants, gorgeous bakes, killer iced espresso and milk, and beer on tap. It‚Äôs worth the trek. 
Pourover ($7.00) - Today they had a choice between Kenyan or Ethiopian beans. Opted for the Kenyan - it was delicious üëå 
White Coffee (4/6/8 oz)
But I kind of like it cos you look amazing just the way you are.

Hadn\'t been back after their revamp partially because they are so hard to catch now with the new operating hours. I have always had a liking for their pork burger so I was quite glad they now do offer three different burgers in their menu. This wasn\'t as fancy as the Pork Burger, but still does very well in satiating my tastebuds. The plump portobello was bouncy and juicy, leaking out the bursting earthiness with every cut, while onions and arugula compliments within. The melted cheese did give some of the savoury flavours to cut off the mushroom, but ultimately the brioche bun was still the one which got me; pillowy soft grilled buns that provided a natural sweetness to the entire burger. Definitely something I will order if I ever crave for something lighter, and I would be back to try the Thai Basil Minced Pork Rice some day too!
J: so you could grow in audacious faith and anointing. #burpple
Flesh was succulent albeit a tad plain in taste. Quick to judge, I shunned the spiced lentils but was quick to realize that it was the most intriguing part of the dish, possessing a flavor that invigorates the taste buds everytime you want to take a break from the mundanity of fried chicken„ÄÇ\n<br />~~~\n<br />@the_xw  I\'m slowly beginning to understand why you love this place but my coffee was seriously lacking today„ÄÇ

The meat is done in a hamburger style and thus rather tender. The apple sauce is not overly sweet and add a nice sweetness to the burger. The crisps are nice too. #necessaryprovisions #burpple #lovecafe #lovefood #cafehopping #cafeatwest #porkburger #burger
Very different from other grilled prawn salad that I had eaten before. The prawns were lay on top of a layer of baby spinach and drizzle with a sauce of fried garlic, shallots &amp; oil. Slightly tangy, chilli &amp; light saltiness taste.
