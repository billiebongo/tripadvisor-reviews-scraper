Average range of sushi but a much better choice than brand name takeaway.
Quality and consistency of product is always good.

This is a fun place for dinner .If you are traveling alone or with a group. Families welcome.We ate here twice as a couple & ran into a family of 5 that we new. All groups enjoyed to food & the experience. Hink if you see something u like grab it. Sometimes it never comes back or its a long wait till you see it again. It is a very long train. Go early or late. The que can be long sometimes during the peak meal times. We ate 23 plates and it cost us $40 singpoare dollars. Best value sushi we every had
