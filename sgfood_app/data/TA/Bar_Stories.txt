Went for a couple of drinks. There's no menu, so just tell the bar tender what type of drinks you like. They will prepare to what you tell. Drinks that are rather strong and pretty presentation.
5
Excellent service and great tasting cocktails. The best part is itâ€™s personalized to what you want! Will definitely return to this bar again
5
A must visit for cocktail lovers with an up-close and personal finish. Explain your flavours of the cocktail and watch them whip you a fantastic drink!

Visited Bar Stories based on recommendations. Was not disappointed. Was feeling under the weather, so asked Sri - at the bar to mix up a cocktail to perk me up. Excellent mix of herbs and drinks broke my fever by the end of the meal, which boosted my appetite to enjoy the succulent seafood cooked to perfection. What a find! Highly recommended - a must go to place in Singapore! Hubby enjoyed his drink and food too, personal touch...smiles all round. $$

Tucked in the Arab street area is this amazing cocktail bar which serves some of the best I've had in Singapore. The bartenders know their stuff and would be glad to brief you on the details of their cocktails and even add a twist on the flavors. I've been coming back regularly since I found out about this place a year ag
5
Took the family for drinks to experience the local culture. The staff were so friendly and helpful. They even made a fruit juice alcohol free drink for my 10 year old. Try sit at the bar so you can see the magic of how they mix your drink

We showed up at Bar Stories on the eve of a public holiday and it was buzzing. The bar is on the top floor of a shop house and can get a bit noisy with multiple people talking together - they should surely turn the music off. We were seated by the bar where one can see the mixologists at work. May be we picked the wrong time as I overheard that 2 bartenders were out - one sick and another on holiday. We had to wait for 20 mins for our turn - there are no menus, the mixologist will ask you what you fancy and then add some of his own suggestions to concoct a drink. I opted for Pisco Sour with passion fruit which was enhanced by burning rosemary, while one of my companions got a berry drink with whiskey and the 3rd person got whiskey with Absinthe. The last drink was unpalatable and we had to ask for a replacement, which was a whiskey sour - that too wasn't the best we've had. While the concept is cool, when it comes to mixing different drinks and mixers it can get tricky as you don't know how each goes with the others and hence a bespoke cocktail bar really needs to get it right (because most requests are untested). Unfortunately on this occasion we didn't really like what we were served, so may not be hurrying back here
4
Came here on a Friday night through a friend's recommendation each of us was asked what we like and each of us was given a different cocktail with its own unique taste! Thumbs up!But the place can get very tight and stuffy when it gets crowded unfortunately hence we didn't really stay on for long..
5
This place has no menu and no food - your drinks are crafted to your preference. The bartender guides you with helpful questions like "Do you like sour, sweet, spicy" and from there crafts out a unique mix. It may seem a bit expensive but it's well worth it for the quality ingredients
5
Bar Stories is a tiny cocktail bar without a menu. Tell the bar person what you like (sour/sweet, rum/whiskey) and he or she will make you something to order. Chances are it will be your new favourite drink. The experience of the bar staff varies from very good to world class. They understand what they are doing and can explain to you why certain ingredients go together. I believe they also run mixology classes. I suspect these would be very good indeed. It's not cheap but not so expensive by Singapore standards.
5
Very small but cosy cocktail bar, where there is no menu, just tell the barman what you like and he creates the taste.
Great fun and when I said I like a bit of fire, he didn't disappoint.
4
This is a fun place to have a different cocktail with the bartenders creating something based on your taste preferences. It's fun with friends and I'd recommend for something different to do.
5
Just tell them what you want your drink to be like then and they get in ready for you .. amazing concept , equally great cocktails !
4
There is no set menu you just give general idea of what flavours and liquors you like and they concoct something delicious.

Brought a foreigner friend to this while exploring haji lane/ arab street area for predinner drinks. Holed upstairs in a shophouse, was a surprise for me with the cosy bar counter upstairs - no menu, no food (well, was told that you can bring your own food) you just have to tell the bartender what you like or feel like having. Ta-da - next min u have some drink close to your liking. i wanted something bittersweetsour and i got vodka with yuzu... my friend got something sweet.. after you name your drink, cheers, and you can basically sit there and chill for some time. I went in the evening on a weekday at 6+ pm and there wasnt a crowd yet. we were at the bar but there were tables at the windows for people watching too.
5
Was there on a Friday evening as a group of 6 for a GF's hen's night. Wanted a chill gathering and so we tried out BAR Stories for cocktails rather than other pub where wild drinking may be tempting :PBooked the place 2 days in advance for Friday 7:30pm but arrived late due to the traffic crowd, but the table was still held for us. Misled by another review website, thinking it served food, but luckily the staff was able to advise us that a neighbouring restaurant partners with them to take orders and deliver to the bar.By the time everyone arrived, it was 8:30pm. Prior to that, they did not pester us to order and still served us water while we waited. Staff was alert and once they saw our final 2 friends arriving, he popped in to take our orders.Since it was a no menu place, what we had to decide was what flavours or "feel" we liked. So it was like a Q&A session with the staff. Descriptions like sweet, not-so-sour, more tangy, tropical, specific fruits, even no-alcohol options.The wow factor came in the many forms of presentation. Every drink was unique to its concoction. Sake bottle, martini glass, bamboo cup, beer bottle, lemongrass stirrer, lime peel floater. Each had its unique taste and we couldn't helped but offered our drinks around the table for everyone to try. It was such a bimbo moment for us.Crowd is generally mild but due to acoustics it can get pretty noisy.The drinks were about $20-30 each which is reason for the quality.Food from the other restaurant is about $80 for 3 finger foods and 3 desserts. Note to bring cash if you are ordering food as there is surcharge for card payment
5
I'd read somewhere that this was a cool bar but had no idea what sort of bar it was. Located near Arab St, in chic Haji Lane (worth a visit itself) Bar Stories is located behind a non descript door and up a set of stairs.It's a small and tight space, best for couples or small groups.Don't make the rookie error of asking for a drinks menu (like I did!).Instead spend your time watching the bar tender work his magic, and then give him a creation brief when it's your turn to order.I felt like something aniseed based, and old mate came to the party with a wonderful drink using absinthe, clove mist, (what looked like fresh thyme) and a artful decoration (which i maintain looks was a Christmas tree and tinsel).My fiance felt like something citrus and have old mate a wide brief to work with. To quote her "this is the most delicious drink I've ever had!".'nuff said!

After reading the great reviews on this place, we stopped here one evening after dinner. The atmosphere is super casual and friendly. Not being a big cocktail guy, I was delighted with the drinks our mixologist came up with. Very creative and delicious. Like all alcohol in Singapore, these drinks won't come cheap but the experience is worth doing at least once. Cheers
4
Dave and team make great, albeit quite, expensive cocktails. The space is small so it's best to make a reservation. I'd highly recommend any of their gin cocktails, all have been excellent. Do note that it's only cocktails, no beer or wine unless things have changed in recent weeks
3
The place has "bespoke" cocktails- One that makes an interesting tryout but comes at a good weight on your wallet. At 25 $ a cocktail- I was not over the top by what I had-The whole idea that there is no menu so how wild you can get is relatively dependent on how much experience you have had with stuff. I had a whisky sour which was pretty standard. Considering its Singapore- where money doesn't really stretch much, if you are on a roll - you may try this place but otherwise its not worth the buck IMHO
5
No menu, just right. Tell them what you want to taste and they'll craft something incredible. Has my highest recommendation.
4
Located at second floor along Haji Lane shop houses. They don't provide menu for cocktails. The waiter will ask what's your taste for cocktail and they will surprise you.! Good for gathering.
5
recommended by a friend so we decided to try it. it is a small bar and the service were attentive and we had really good cocktails and well executed with nice presentation and flavours.
5
We are a group of four adults who like cocktails, this bar created the best cocktails we ever tasted. The bar staff were exceptionally helpful (we walked in with no reservation, best to book in future) they created four individual cocktails which were unique and delicious. I would recommend this to everyone who likes cocktails
5
Worth a visit however be prepared to spend more than usual on a drink. No menu, just tell the waiter what you feel like or what your mood is & he'll come up with just the perfect concoction for you. Very small premises though & quite busy on the night we were there but everyone seemed happy other than the staff. Maybe it was because they were in the middle of renovations but we couldn't see this. One of the waiters told us the kitchen was closed due to renovations when we asked if they were serving any food. Probably would have been better if they served some nibbles to accompany the drinks. Been there, done that & not sure I'd make a point to go back
4
We have been meaning to try Bar Stories for a long time and we finally managed to get there. It was well worth the visit. Not so kind on the wallet but that's Singapore for you and you really are paying for the creativity that goes into the cocktails. Having no menu may be a bit daunting to some but it was fun! There's nothing like the element of surprise every time your drink is served. With inventive mixes and clever garnishes you will not be disappointed. Great place to start or finish your night
5
This is not a bar you go to and order a vodka soda. There is no menu -- instead, you describe the things that you like to your server, and they will create a custom drink for you. My husband and I went here for a drink with our ex-pat family and absolutely loved it. Each of the 4 of us had very different drinks, but every one was delicious. A fun experience! The atmosphere is cozy and intimate. Highly recommend
4
This is a bar with no menu. You can ask for anything you want. Each drink will cost you around 30SGD. This is the place present you cocktail as an art form. Definitely not the place if you are looking for a drunk. Was fun to visit with a bunch of friends
5
Went to this small bar at one of Haji Lane shop houses stretch because a friend of mine recommended the place. We were greeted by the friendly bartender Dave. The place was small, cozy and intimate, there were no jarring background music and the ambient was just nice for friendly hangout place. He explained that they don't have a menu there, we can describe what kind of drinks we would like to have and he'll create it for us! How exciting is that! So for the first drink, my friend ordered something pretty (must be Instagram worthy!), sweet, and fruity. He came out with this beautiful flaming cocktail in tiki glass with a mixture of so many fruity cocktail inside including passion fruits, lemon, lime and God knows what else... It taste brilliant! And definitely Instagram worthy! 2nd drink was mine, I wanted something fresh, cool, sweet, and when I mentioned I love Lemongrass, he proposed to have that as part of the ingredients mixed them with berries. Sounds awesome! He came up with this tall glass in a small bucket of ice and top it up with blackberries, raspberries and yogurt pearl in a bowl made of ice. The taste was really refreshing, sweet and sour, and the yogurt pearl just burst in your mouth. Hell, if I could get a bucket full of those pearl I'll be a very happy woman! I definitely enjoyed every sip of my drink! The last drink was called into the forest (the only drink that has a name!) my friend wanted something sweet and strong and.. I forgot what else At a first glance it looks like a bowl of soup. We were close to order croutons to go with it . But hey, what's not to like about this drink, look how pretty it is! Not as strong as she would have wanted it, but it was definitely still a great drink.I would say we are 100% satisfied with our drinks. And even though the price was a bit on the high side, (approx 22-25sgd each), I would say with that kind of personalisation and experience, it was definitely money well spent. The drinks are no longer just drinks, they are pieces of art and this bar certainly proves me right. We thoroughly enjoy our experience here and will definitely recommend to anyone who wants to try!

was here for after dinner drinks on a week day evening. first visit, but the stroll down haji lane was alluring charming in the night.If this is your first visit here, grab seats by the bar. The bartender - he's got some good experiences with clients to share.Do not expect a menu, do not order the standard like we know (the vodka lime, gin tonic, etc) But! look inside yourself and tell the bartender what you feel like? Maybe, a trip to Japan....tell him too if your taste buds are going after a drinks that more citrus or vanilla. ..he's seen and mixed enough...Be pleasantly surprised! he'll not only serve up something refreshingly different, but also a delight for Instagram fanatics.Good hangout...i wonder they start from 3pm
5
So I've never seen a concept like this for a bar before. There is no menu so the idea is that you describe a taste that you like with the barman and then he creates it. It's almost like talking to a creative consultant about a product you want and imagine and then before your eyes he meticulously prepares the glass, drink, flavorings and the garnish. The end result was amazing and I would highly recommend a visit
5
There is no menu at this place and it is very hard to find. It is in a very small door way down Haji lane. When you get in you have to walk up the stairs. I asked for a whisky cocktail that is peaty. The waiter took his time to perfect a great drink for me. The experience was fantastic!We stayed and chatted for a while and found this place was a little gem in a big city!A must do if you are in Singapore
4
There is definitely a craft being performed here, so try and think of something you'd really like to try. Or ask the bartender to make something while you tell him your favorite types of ingredients. I got a little creative with my choice and had rasberries, gin, rosemary, and something else I cannot remember. Cris had tequila, lemon, lemon grass, and pepper. Both of the drinks were amazing. I'm gonna research my next choices and arrive prepared on the next order.Also, the place is easy to miss. It's located on the second floor at Haji lane with a small door leading to a stairwell. Keep your eye out
5
Unless you have a sharp eye, U'll miss the place. Upstairs to a row of shop-houses along Haji lane , the new bohemian place in Beach Road area. Forget about menu, wines and beer. Just ask the bartender to serve you based on your inclination and likings. You will get plentiful cocktails to enjoy ! Whether you are alone or with a group of friends , you'll enjoy and saviour life. My favourites are rosemary Hendriks and passion pisco! Ask David Koh the bartender to stir you a storm ! Enjoy 
3
Well, bring your friend here if you want to keep them hostage in conversation, because there really isn't anything else to do while waiting for your drink to be done. For me, it wasn't worth the wait of 25mins for a drink and in the end the drink wasn't that fantastic as well. Perhaps I'm quite particular about my drinks, and others will find this place alright
4
A great sign of Singapore growing up and getting creative! Great concept done well - the bar does not have a drinks list. Customers are engaged in a chat by the staff about their mood, their preferred flavours and the kind of day they've had. And voila - a cocktail to fit! Priced between SGD20-25 a drink, it is a novel idea, some refreshing tastes and a cool ambiance in the small bar in a loft on Haji Lane. Nice
5
The ambience is very low key but the cocktails are amazing. These cocktails rank up there with the high end New York and SF cocktail scenes. The bartender really wants to know what kind of cocktail you like and create inventive and delicious drinks. Between the 4 of us we had 8 different drinks and they all came out looking and tasting amazing. I wish we had this in San Francisco. Drinks are pricier than other bars but well worth i
4
Our tour guide pointed out Bar Stories while we were on Haji Lane in the morning. We decided to give it a try later that evening. The bartender was very engaging and explained the concept of customising cocktails in accordance to a client's taste. A friend who likes fruity drinks was served a cocktail in a tea pot with an elaborate floral arrangement. My other buddy and I were served cocktails infused with herbs and was flamed. It was fascinating to watch him prepare the drinks from scratch. I think its really part of the bar's charm. I just can't imagine how they manage when the bar is full!The drinks were good and tasty but a bit pricey. The bartender was also nice enough to give tips on where to go for bar hopping/ It's worth a visit just for the heck of it
4
Fun and great cozy atmosphere to chill-out together with your partner.No menu, bespoke cocktails are priced between $20-25 each, which is actually quite reasonable for that kinda of environment. However, we saw that everyone's cocktails were quite similiar (just changing the "fruit flavor" which you prefer and the cup to contain it) - Maybe it was a busy evening (weekend), and they didn't want to challenge themselves.Might go back to challenge their creative cocktails.. Just for fun..
4
Kind of a novelty experience for me, visiting a bespoke cocktail bar. Nice cosy environment with dim lights. They have no menu, you tell them the taste you like and they concoct a cocktail for you based on what you've told them. The waitress (proprietress?) took her time explaining the idea to us and led us through our likes and dislikes. Our drinks all turned out fine but our orders took some time. $20 to $25 for a cocktail isn't cheap but the experience was fun and surprising.
4
A very unique cocktail on haji lane! Quick and prompt service, lacking atmosphere, hide away bar, but I hope to come and visit again and hope this rises to be come a very good cocktail bar as it's got the potential to be top notch!
5
Absolutely loved loved loved Barstories... Zak made us both the most amazing cocktails and my wife swears the one she had was the best cocktail ever... :-)
Cannot wait to get back to Singapore to revisit my favorite cocktail bar :-)
Highly recommended :-)

Personally, I don't really fancy the idea of no menu. You won't know how your drink will turn out until you get your drink - which means you'll probably be paying 20 - 30 bucks for a drink that you may not like.Sorry to say but bar stories was the case for me. I felt the drink I had was not good and the drinks my friends had had a lot of ice in them. Service was also pretty slow.Average place.
1
We found this bar through some research on Google and were extremely disappointed! The bartender who served us was not only rude, but also treated us as if we didn't know anything about spirits. My husband and I have been to a fair few bars with no menus, so this was not our first time. While the bartender was talking us through what he was going to make, I mentioned that I didn't like Gordons Gin and yet that's what he served me. He also made a terrible whisky sour and didn't understand that 'less is more'. We were expecting to get better spirits and good cocktails, especially for the price that we had to pay for a drink. Good concept, but there was no atmosphere in the bar (it was too bright), service was terrible and everything about it seemed like they were trying too hard. Would rather spend my money at a bar with a nice vibe, where people know how to mix a good drink
5
This is a unique cocktail bar. There is no menu.The bar staff ask what your taste preferences are (sweet, sour etc) and what alcoholic sprits you enjoy and they create a cocktail for you.In both cases the bartender was spot on.The cost for two cocktails was s$57I would recommend you try this bar out. It opens from 4pm daily
5
A very unique place that should be on anyones must visit list; well, almost anyone, some friends I took listened to the introduction, then asked for beers on tap and a wine list, they aren't the target audience.The concept with this bar is no menus, just a discussion with the bartender and a customized drink is brought out for you. In my many visits here I have only had one less than stellar visit and that was because our particular bartender that night, just didn't interact well with us, not fun, good drinks, but not exciting. Every other visit is fun with the bartender discussing your tastes and pushing you to try something new and expand your tastes.The service is above and beyond, in fact, one visit my wife was explaining that she doesn't like Gin, and a voice from across the room yelled out "You do too, like Gin, the last two times you were here I served you Gin" Two things about this, 1) We are not THAT regular, but they remembered us 2) They push you to try new things that even you don't realize you like. The drinks are not just mixed cocktails, but they are complete experiences, a table of four will likely have something flaming, some herb or unique fruit and maybe even a merengue. No two visits are the same and no two drinks are the same, it is a great experience and definitely a place to go with friends you will share drinks with to try it all.PS: I do advise making reservations, we have been lucky just walking up, but making a reservation ahead is advisable and allows you to request a bar seat which is the best experience
4
I can only say what an absolutely different place this is. There is no menu - you just tell the barman what you want as your basic spirit, roughly what you like flavour wise and then cross your fingers Your cocktail can end up with fruit, pepper, sage and thyme, fruit, mint, on fire .....It's not cheap, but worth a treat.It's quite difficult to find - tucked away upstairs in Haji Street in the Arab Quarter
5
What a great experience...They have no menu. You just tell them the flavours you like (or feel like) and they make a drink that will suit YOU.Now the drinks are not cheap BUT they are special. We went for 1 drink and ended up staying for 4. And we met other people there who tried different drinks and it made for great conversation.I'll be back

We went for a cocktail or two with a group of friends on Saturday night. We went before dinner and the place was largely empty, and as such the cocktail and service was pretty good - and we decided to come back after our meal with a couple of other friends, and this was where the experience was less than ideal.We managed to find a seat and sat down and chatted away, we noticed that the place was pretty busy but we had to find a way to get the attention of the waiting crew to decide what to drink. We order 6 drinks and kept on chatting. After about 30 odd minutes, our first cocktail arrived, but there was no sign of the others, so we waited, waited and waited. About 45 minutes later 4 of the 6 cocktails had turned up (albeit one by one), at which point the server simply served the cocktail without any finesse, I asked him that to start again with servicing the drink, as I had issues with the way it was delivered to our guest. He apologised and explained the drink cocktail and it was this time served properly. We then asked what happened to the other 2 drinks, at which point the barman who we ordered the drink came over and asked whether we had all of our drinks, which we advised was not the case.He then recapped the two missing drinks and went away to 'order' it from the bar (of course, this meant that they were not ordered in the first place, or 'missed'). My drink turned up, but we were still missing one last drink, and the barmen asked what it was, after waiting almost an hour we told him to forget it and we commented how long it took to get 5 our of our 6 drinks. After another few minutes, they turned up with the 6th drink and offered it on the house.We heard that another table sitting next to us had ordered their second drink but this did not arrive, so they had decided to go the bill and leave. We also know that other tables had drinks returned or delivery late.At the end of the night, after things calmed down, the barmen came over to apologise for the delays - noting that it was busy, and that yesterday (Friday night) wasn't as busy and service was okay. The whole night we could see that the service and bar staff were so disorganised, confused on orders, and couldn't keep track with what was served, and what remained. This place has been going for a while, so I am absolutely amazed that they cannot cope with patrons visiting on what should be a normal busy night - they don't serve any food, so it is simply drinks - and how can they get the service and delivery so wrong. What do they expect for a Friday or Saturday night is beyond me!?Mixology is not a new thing in Singapore, and many places have appeared over the last 18 months, so Bar Stories has to be careful that they don't lose people over its poor service, as its reputation can go out the window very quickly.The irony is that the cocktails are generally very, very nice; albeit slightly on the pricey side, but the service and the delays really ruin the experience. I know the guys tried, but there is definitely a lot to learn from these types of experiences

Been to Bar stories many times, and used to ends up being a very memorable experience. Chic setting, great bar counter, and chatty bartenders spinning up very creative drinks... a visual delight and great tasting cocktails!HOWEVER...changes in staff? and or management? or just the attitude... makes this the worst place to step into.For us, a hope for great evening hosting a visiting friend turned into a nightmare. First, the bartender was plain rude, refusing to seat us by the bar counter. Why - some (new, and very random) rule about not letting over 3 people of a group at the bar. Thats ok...if it's a fairly busy time. This was monday evening..and with literally 2-4 other customers during the entire time! so we were sent packing to a dingy corner, away from the action and fun. This 'rule' was visibly random, targeted, and new for us regulars who have enjoyed multiple fun nights at the bar counter, in more crowded nights, and in larger numbers. But hey, who are we to say...just customers (which means nothing to the 'cool n chic' bar stories staff)Then came the order taking...also usually a delightful process of interaction with the (used to be) social, friendly staff. This guy chose to take our orders from his pedestal at the bar counter, several feet away from us. Upon requesting politely, he obliged to come closer to us to have a 'conversation' as the order process here tends to be.Next on delivering the cocktails...he concocted and brought the first ones out. Now, to the very common, and genuine qn from my friend "is this mine?" (bcos you dont know what shape, color, or style your drink at bar stories could be..thats part of the 'fun', the bartenders response was 'why would i put it in front of you otherwise?!' (Paraphrased, but only a soft attempt to recreate the curt reply that left a bad taste, before the first sip went in!I used to say expensive, but great drinks and great experience makes this worth a trip. Now it is just expensive
1
The service on the other hand stank. The place was empty and even then they failed to come and ask if we wanted a second drink - so we left...!
1
Great venue, but the story has lost its mojo. So many other cocktail bars better than this. Asked for hell and received a martini. Really???
3
Nice that they take real care with your order and make something "to your taste" as there is no menu. Very artistic and the decor and music is really cool.Good luck getting a 2nd round as it takes about 30-minutes to get your first drink on a week night - no idea about weekends. Took another 30 minutes to get the bill and only when we got up and were about to walk did they actually take our money.Good concept but needs either:A - more staffB - 2nd location nearby/next door (with more staff)C - reduction in prices (30 bucks a drink is ok if the Fullerton or MBS because they are LIGHTNING FAST and make DAMNED GOOD DRINKS)Will probably take friends visiting but that's about it
5
Now, Alchemists, this is a must visit place. Some mixed reviews on here. Cocktails are great, and the 3 servers are extremely good. I didn't think it was expensive at all(you are in singapore after all), and what you got was a different drink each time. What I got was a unique experience compared to the usual water downed drinks in every sky bar/roof top bar/great view bar that I've ever been to.set me up for a great night listening to the live music outside
2
The artisan drink fad has reached Singapore, and alas, people here have taken it to an unnecessary monetary expense for the customers. Basically, they prepare something for you based on whatever information you give them, although I suspect they still have a set of cocktails in mind that they just give you as a personalized drink. All is fine and good, but the price is just exorbitant. My friend paid 30 bucks for a cocktail, and I think mine was 25 which is about the cheapest they charge. Unexusable.
2
I had heard a lot about bar stories, so paid a visit to only find one bleached hair rude chap serve us. He appears to be disinterested and looks at you as if you are a mixologist too and should know everything!! The cocktails were very nice, as we'd been there on a weekday it wasnt crowded and got a decent place to sit back and enjoy the drink. I would have gone back surely if mr know all wasn't giving stares and serving drinks to spoil ny evening

I have been to Bar Stories a few time over the past year and have been recommending it to friends as an interesting place to visit if you like cocktails. I brought a few friends over again tonight and was sorely disappointed in the level of service provided to my group by a member of staff. While he was taking our drinks preferences, he appeared bored and uninterested and (unlike our bartenders on previous visits) did not offer much advice for drink mixes other than "lychees and berries are very different to each other.", in what was a pretty sarcastic tone of voice. And when our orders arrived, the first set of drinks was sent round by his colleague who took the time to explain what the drinks were and what mixes they put in. When he sent the last drink over to our table, where my friend had requested a cocktail that would be energizing, he basically set the glass down and said "coffee and ginger". When asked if there was alcohol in it, he just replied yes and didn't bother to give an explanation of what alcohol was in it or why that particular concoction was created. Which is really one of the selling points for Bar Stories, why particular ingredients were used and how they came up with it.This particular member of staff never once asked us how our drinks were, and yet he asked the table behind us how their drinks were, so I'm not sure if we had offended him somewhat during our short interaction while ordering drinks.Have had mostly pleasant experiences at Bar Stories, most notably David has been great but was very let down by tonight's server, a youngish guy with bleached hair. I would come back, but only if I was assigned a different server

So, I've read reviews around about this bar stories and alot of people have been uraving about it.I've decided to check it out with my boyfriend, G. So, when I first stepped I was pretty stoked of what cocktails are gonna come my way.When we sat down at the bar, service was pretty good. G and I ordered sweet potato fritters and it was good. Next up, our drinks. G ordered a vodka based semi sweet, semi sour cocktail. It was good. And then my turn, I ordered passion fruit flavor,scotch based, sweet and sour and it was really good.In between,G and I were talking about work and other stuff (we work in the f&b industry and were discussing how awesome bar stories is.) . All was well until we started talking to the mixologist who's a malay and has blonde hair. We were asking simple questions like what the flowers on the bar top are. His replies were as sharp as a samurai's sword.The moment that actually took me aback when G went to he washroom and I casually asked if they were hiring and he said and I quote, 'why don't you go ask your male friend over there whether D***y and e****d are hiring.'. To me, as a person who works in the same industry as he does, that is very unprofessional.Okay, so when my boyfriend came back, we ordered a second round of drinks, G wanted a vodka based, semi sweet, semi sour cocktail and it turned out pretty average. This time round, I was wanting to challenge the blonde mixologist and told him I wanted a clear, light minty and tangy drink suitable for after meal but instead, I was served a very revolting drink. It literally smells like latex, taste like tyres and with each sip, I have to control my gag reflex. I mean, what kind of mixolgist don't taste their drink before serving? Besides, from what I do understand, two kinds of herbs, two kinds of aromatic bitters, two kinds of spices, two kinds of alcohol and eventually all carbonated together doesn't look or smell like after meal kinda drink. Even after a meal of bak kut teh and teh-o, the taste of the tyre tasting cocktail still lingers in my mouth. Really, if asked whether I'll head back there again, yes I will but without Mr. Mat Blondie around to ruin the atmosphere

No bar menu, no predictable cocktails just select your fave spirit and type of taste and hey presto you get your own bespoke drink presented beautifully in front of you. The bar staff are pure genius the way they mix, the tools used and the art form in the presentation.The bar is in the top stroy of a gorgous shop house on the vibrant Haji lane its really chilled out and a great place to chat and socialise.Will be back again and againPS. Be ready for the bill mentally - these are good quality cocktails

The first time we came here, we didn't really know what to expect. My husband had heard that they made 'bespoke' cocktails so we decided to try it out for his birthday. We were the first customers in and managed to get a seat by the window in some nice retro armchairs. The first member of staff that greeted us was very friendly and polite. However, the next member of staff, who came to take our order had a real attitude problem. He pretty much snapped our heads off when we were deciding on a cocktail. My husband politely asked "What's that lovely smell- what are you putting in the cocktail?" and this member of staff replied "Stuff" whilst rolling his eyes at us. He made us feel bad for even being there! How rude! The cocktails were out of this world, but the service was awful and we vowed never to go back if that same member of staff was serving. To be honest he really ruined the whole experience for us. Well, we did go back, this time with a couple of friends. We looked around to see if the rude guy was serving and it looked like he wasn't, so we all sat down. Then, guess who came to serve us! Once again we were confronted with this nonchalant 'can't be bothered to serve the likes of you' attitude. He actually snapped at one of our friends when they couldn't decide on what ingredients to put in their cocktails! Sorry, Bar stories. We won't be back until you give your staff a serious lesson in customer service- especially with the prices of your cocktails

Bespoke Cocktails. Unpretenious set-up and great service. Look out for Kino and Dave who make one of the best cocktails in town.

The mixologists are great! They put a lot of effort into every cocktail, which is highly commendable. Unfortunately, the taste is not as great as it looks. There are other better places to go, but I would say that Bar Stories is not bad.

Interesting concept in cocktail making basis your mood, thoughts, taste. A different experience for an evening drink with your friends, very friendly bar men, all in all, a must go!

Sit at the bar and be amazed. Making cocktails becomes an art done with such care and attention. The results are amazing. Excellent way to start or finish an evening

We stopped here for some drinks while trolling Singapore's Haji Lane. What I love about this place is that upstairs on a Saturday afternoon was such a great place to just relax and watch the people to by downstairs on the lane. The drinks are made bespoked based on your mood and desires at the moment and the bartender was just super great. A friend ordered some fries, cooked with truffle (?) oil? It was really really good

We brought some overseas guests with us to try out Bar Stories with recommendations from friends. We found a gem! The food was really unique and so tasteful. The lobster pasta, fried squid with squid ink, pork cheeks, fries with truffle oil were just fantastic...these were just a few items of the items we ordered. Service was excellent and staff was very knowledgeable on menus and cocktails. ..the staff were friendly and fun. Our overseas guests were impressed. The only thing to work on improving is the toilet. Unisex toilets usually are not as clean. :) Aside from that, keep up the wonderful food standards and service. Will definitely be back.

Hidden away from the main street crowds, nestled above the laneway foot traffic lies one of Singapore's hidden secrets - Bar Stories!A bar without a cocktail menu - with help from your imagination and your mixologist's skill your unique cocktail is but a moment away.Loved this bar and the experience.4 cocktails set us back just under $100SNG - small price to pay for amazing custom built cocktails and great conversation from the bar staff :

This bar is absolutely fantastic - the drinks are full of creativity and taste spectacular! These mixologists know their stuff! Our bartender was also kind enough to give us some caramel flavoured shots complete with dry ice on the house at the end - delicious!The whole process isn't based on a menu and you just tell the mixologists what flavours/alcohols you like and then they proceed to make you a spectacular drink! They whip out every gadget from blowtorches and milk frothers to various containers for your drink such as a milk bottle, mug or just a standard martini glass. Pricing is pretty reasonable for the amount of effort they put into your drink from around SGD$20-30 depending on what you order.I'd definitely recommend Bar Stories and it's definitely an entertaining experience as well as one for the taste buds

No menu just creative cocktails. Tell the bar person if you like sweet or sour and any preferred liquors and he creates an individual cocktail. $25 SGD Nett per drink flat rate but enough alcohol to make you mellow. When full service can be a little slow but that the watching and waiting is part of the fun. Get a seat at he bar to watch the creativit

A hidden gem! I loved the concept of this bar with no cocktail menu, the waiters ask for your preference and discuss your tastes before creating a unique combination. Beautifully presented and delicious. I recommend sitting at the bar where you can watch the guys creating the different cocktails, utilising a vast array of equipment and flavours. Ideal for pre dinner drinks or a chilled out evening

No menu, but the staff are excellent with judging what you'll like. But do expect to spend $25-30 per drink... Hoenstly, the experience is worth it. Just go.

Small upstairs bar down Haji Street with simple but good ambience. All cocktails are custom-made depending on your tastes and I have to say they were spot on. There were 3 of us and we tried all 3 drinks but realised we liked our personalised ones best! 3/3 - not bad.Only for special occasions though considering the hefty price tag of 25 dollars a cocktail! Great way to start the evening on Arab Street though..

Came here on a Monday night after dinner. We entered through a wooden staircase, and came to the central sunken bar, where three somewhat inebriated patrons were loudly joking with the bartender. Said bartender then insisted that we sit at the "best seats in the house" - at the bar - and proceeded to ignore us. We moved to the sofa, which prompted a snarky "don't like the good seats?" from the bartender, as he continued to ignore us. We waved down the waitress - whose relationship with the "mixologist" seemed to resemble that between Basil and Sybil Fawlty - who told us that there was no drink list, and that the mixologist would be with us soon, and she couldn't take orders. A further ten minutes later, she kneeled beside us and said "So you don't have to wait another hour, let me help you". She explained the "concept" there was no drink list, and we had to answer a series of questions that carried the faint whiff of soft core pornography. What's your favourite fruit? What's your favourite liquor? Do you like it sweet or sour? Soft or strong? Do you like it creamy?After providing a series of answers that probably would have seen us arrested in not-too-long-ago Singapore, the waitress disappeared. At this point, a middle-aged gent in a silly peaked cap entered with his female companion, and was greeted with a loud "So you've got a new friend, eh?" from the "mixologist". The companion turned the colour of the drink she was to be later served, and sat down quietly. Not long after, our drinks arrived. A passionfruit whiskey sour, which for some reason had a flaming raft of passionfruit husk in it - which I was helpfully advised to "extinguish before drinking" - and a mocktail concoction which seemed to have a large amount of whole grapes in it. The whiskey sour was sickly sweet - surely defeating the purpose of making a "Whiskey sour" - and didn't taste remotely of whiskey, although it had some kind of alcohol in it. It was about this time that we started googling reviews of this establishment on hungrygowhere.com - and noticing that the drinks that had been "invented" for previous customers were all making encore appearances tonight, a little like the annual re-run of the Sound of Music when we were kids. Black Forest Mojito? Check. Whiskey tumbler with a jungle of Rosemary in it? Check. (Rosemary? In a drink? Really? REALLY?) We also noticed the sense of violation that previous customers had felt when presented with their bill - presumably the rationale behind the no-drink-menu policy is to preserve the sticker shock until you can no longer walk out. By now the crowd had picked up, and the policy of the-help-can't-talk-to-the-customers had been reinforced. The passionfruit whiskey sour remained sickly sweet to the last drop, and my companion at least got some mental exercise trying to work out how to extract the whole grapes from the base of her highball glass using only a straw. It was then that I noticed the conspicuously placed, absurdly oversized flame throwers around the bar, and the number of patron's drinks that seemed to be gratuitously set ablaze. Which, apart from the senseless waste of alcohol, seemed to be dangerously incongruous with the all-wood fit out. When the bill arrived, it was "only" $22 for the whiskey-not-sour, and $15 for the mocktail... and the mixologist gave us a haughty cold shoulder on the way out, presumably either for having the temerity to sit on the sofa, or for messing with his margin calculations by only having one drink each.Tip for young players - save your coin and head around the corner to the Blu Jazz cafe, which makes a passable Mojito for half the price, without the added fruit salad, snark, or liquid-based performance of Dante's Inferno

Despite other reviews I did not find Bar Stories that expensive. I was curious after I heard Anthony Bourdain had visited, so we had to go to check it out. The ambience was great, in what Melbournians are used to; a laneway that takes on a different character at night time. The mixologists were friendly and welcoming, there was no pretence and we did not have to book. The bar gets busy later at night but the staff do not rush you or make you feel unwelcome. The food at the bar was great for the venue small plates and able to be eaten while drinking beautiful cocktails...if they gave Michelin Stars to mixologists this place would get one for pure imagination. I am sure the mixologists have some tricks up their sleeve to please but that did not matter as it was a great night and well worth a visit if you are a cocktail lover and want to experiment with flavours

Though the cocktail here are special. And like the rest had mentioned, no menu, no standard mix, just wait to be surprised. However, if u do drink, it will definitely burn a big hole in your wallet as the cocktail/martinis here are priced at around $25 each!!and for those who are serious about their drink, u might find some cocktail here tasting like virgin cocktails. Avoid Sat night as the staffs are not able to cope with the over crowded place. We had to wait about an hour for the cocktail!!!

Took out of town visitors here to rid them of the shopping sterility of singapore. The walk through haji lane transports you to a rather different singapore. Once you sit at the bar the mixologist actually take time to understand what you like and might be pushed to try. Go with an open mind and savour

If you are looking for traditional cocktails, this is not the place. They do it too, but they like to do things with a twist. No fixed menu, no fixed mixologist.My first time here was a busy Sat night. Even though we were there nearly at midnight, the place was busy, much too busy for the staff to cope. We ordered and waited, checked with the server and waited some more, and waited. The server ended up giving us a free shot of shoju each (which was nice..but we were really thirsty for our drinks!). We ended up getting our first drinks 1.15 hr later!The next few times were pre-dinner drinks, so it was much better. and we got a seat at the bar, which guaranteed immediate attention.Drinks here are fancy...and sometimes a little too sweet for our liking. The place is homely and nice, with exposed brick walls and nice couches. Plus, it is set in a shophouse in the cool Haji Lane. To my angmo friends, it felt like their homes.And yeah, you do pay for fancy drinks. So watch your orders as the bill can easily pile up.PS. I still kind of prefer Nektar personally. Drinks are not so fancy, and better made

This place is a gem of a find in the heart of SG - hidden away on Haji Lane street few blocks away from the Bugis station. It is a MUST-GO when in SG. The bartenders are attentive and really cater to what you really want. Their drinks are incredibly creative and delicious

No drinks menu, no beer, no wine, no soft drinks. These folks specialize. Cocktails is what serve and they design each drink according to your imagination. Really impressive what the young bartenders come up with. It's expensive, yes, very expensive, but you pay for a small piece of art with each cocktail you get. A nice living room ambience makes the whole thing a great experience

Went there on my boyfriend's birthday. Great choice recommended by Twitter friends :) as said by others, no menu, just a bartender asking you whether you want sweet, sour or spicy and what you wouldn't want in there. Whilst watching him make my drink, I started to wish I had told him no egg as suddenly egg white was being beaten. Hummmmm.. But I shouldn't have worried, it was lovely. It was a variation on a whiskey sour but I didn't even recognize the whiskey at first as the egg white softens it. Boyfriend loved his drink too as did many of the other guests. Great touch as mine looked like a cup of coffee :
