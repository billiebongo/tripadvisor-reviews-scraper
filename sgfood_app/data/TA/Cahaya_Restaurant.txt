Lunch hour is very short and Cahaya never fails. Able to cook fast despite the rush hour! Plus the food is excellent.

I have been going to this restaurant for more than 15 years, its still one of my favourite local restaurants. Expect a wide variety of dishes below $10

Cahaya restaurant is halal restaurant and it worth the money to have lunch or dinner. Overall the service and the staff are efficient. Try to avoid the lunch time as they are a lot of office staff having lunch or taking away.

Affordable yet delicious food around town area. From noodles to rice, everything is cheap and delicious that can fill your stomach.

Muslim food....dishes are average and cold..
If u want Muslim food best to go down to the basement of the same building or go to the 5th floor...
Not something we going to try again

We took lunch and dinner here several time due to budget and it's halal resto. We ordered some fried rices, mie, kwe tiao, u-tiao, chicken rice, laksa, hot & ice tea with milk.Some taste good, some just good enough to eat. The service is fast but sometime they put wrong order. So always check what they serve

There's a reason why this place is always very crowded but it is not difficult to get a table. The food are served very fast! Personally love their Rice with Chilli Crab Sauce @ only $6 and their Fried Wantan is a must order everytime I eat there. Certain food are not as delicious though so it really depends

Came here after a long hiatus from this restaurant. Food is still decent! I had the lemon chicken rice and the fried wanton which seems to be the popular choice here. Really can't go wrong with the fried rice dishes,so if you're in Orchard and looking for cheap eats, look no further!

The soup that I order is not hot and not even warm.I have to request to made it hot... I order fried wanton and it came last,and it's not even HOT and it's cold and wanton skin is not crisp at all. waited so long and this what we get... If the owner reading this,PLS WAKE UP! Yr food become more and more slack from bad to worse
