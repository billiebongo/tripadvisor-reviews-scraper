Economical dish of rice and mixed vegetables/meat.
A must-eat everytime im in the area. As a local Singaporean, this is one of my favourite mixed rice stalls.

Home cooked food is what most people after in busy lifestyle. This stall has been at the same place for period longer than most can remember. Queue is normal. Food is in general very home cooked alike but towards to tasteful side, means very appealing to more mature eaters. The environment may not be everyone taste though.Strongly recommended even you need to travel there to eat. You will know what you have missed after patronising this stall from your everyday meal

One of the better Cai Fan places in Singapore popular with locals in the Marine Parade area, you can expect a queue here during lunch. Bear in mind they don't open on certain days.Their Otak - spicy fish cake is great.As Marine Parade and nearby Katong develops and restaurant chains proliferate, I am glad stalls like Xing Long is going strong.Do note that they're on the expensive category for Cai Fan

This is one of my favourite Cai Fan(mixed vegetable rice). It is not exactly cheap for a hawker center stall, however from what i understand, they used higher quality ingredients compared to other vegetable rice stalls. I can also taste the difference, the rice is more fragrant and not overly moist. Most of the dishes here demonstrates the time and care taken by the cooks, thus feels like home cooked food.Barbarque chicken cubes- Chicken trimmed of fat and bones in a barbaque sauce. It is good with rice and trimming off fats does make it slightly healthier.Lemon Fried Fish- This is always a problematic dish for many cai fan stalls, most of the time, i end up eating deep fried flour with lemon sauce, with hardly any fish meat. However, the lemon fried fish over here provides a decent but not generous amount of fish meat, allowing the texture and taste of eating fish.Otak- While this is popular with many people, I personally do not like this dish as i dont like steamed Otah. I find this abit too soft and watery.Fish Fillet- This is quite an expensive item, Fish fillets topped with a little mayo. The fish fillet is decent, and almost up to the quality standard of fish and co and manhatten, of course with a size difference. However, it does not make it any more different from most cai fan stalls.
