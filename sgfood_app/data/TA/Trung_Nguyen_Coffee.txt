I've worked and stayed in VN for a few years and since I've been back in SG, I've had trouble finding a good, authentic bowl of Pho Bo in SG. Either the noodles they used were the wrong kind 'soft and mushy) or the soup simply didn't have that pow-wow of Pho you'll find in Saigon.But what an amazing bowl of Pho you'll find in Trung Nguyen. In it itself, Trung Nguyen is well known for its coffee and with their Pho set.... Completely complementing the flavour, it transported me back to the streets of Saigon.Go ahead and pile on the veggies and lime, it gives it the real authentic VN taste.Really the best bowl of Pho I've found in SG. Those at Joo Chiat often fall short. But this, this is the real deal.

Lesson learned. A coffee shop is not the best place to get Pho Bo or Vietnamese beef noodle soup. Because it's a coffee shop. Though the soup isn't bad, it's also not great. Walk less than a hundred meters away and you will come across another Vietnamese shop selling Pho. Taste is better and price is lower. Service though is good. Smiling cashier and waitress.
