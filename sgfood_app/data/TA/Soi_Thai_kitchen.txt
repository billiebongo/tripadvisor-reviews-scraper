Had the usual fav thai basil chicken with rice... The dish was too dry with no sauce at all. Chicken tasted rubbery as well. Disappointing!

Afford-ably priced thai food that tasted great. Service was so-so I can't expect much either from a small restaurant.

Been patronizing this kitchen for several years & is mostly happy with their food & service. The dishes are cooked by Thai chefs run by a Taiwanese Lady Boss. The food are delicious & of restaurant standard at wallet friendly prices. Dinner starts at 5.30pm & is easily packed by 6.30pm. They will be closed on 15 - 16 Feb this CNY so don't plan on having dinner there. Good food with modest settings at heartland price

Good and authentic food. It is always crowded at main meal times, and open from 530 pm for dinner.The food was generally good, if the portions were slightly smaller than before. We had the phad thai, olive fried rice, pineapple rice, mango salad, green curry chicken, fish cake, egg with radish and mixed vegetables. The popular dishes were the fish cakes and olive rice

Went during evening peak period, order few dishes, however the foods and drinks took quite long to serve, when check with the waiter, he came back and took my order again, so I strongly believe that they have forget about my order. After 2nd time when they took my order, the foods was served within 15mins. The place was so packed with people waiting and queuing. Food wise was good. Just a reminder, avoid the evening peak period.

We have been a regular at Soi Thai, not just for the food but for the service and their ability to customize your order. The chef allowed us to order items which are not in the menu. Our favorite has been their Seafood green curry which is not in their menu. The portions are sufficient for 2 - 3 pax usually. I recommend their Thai Ice Milk tea and Red Ruby dessert

Although the prices are reasonable, unfortunately, some things just cannot compromise. For example, i like my Tom Yam soup hot so serving it in a bowl basically means it gets cold quite quickly. I like their Fried Tofu in thai chili sauce, real crispy and tasty. Service was excellent

We had a family dinner so decided to get a few dishes from here.We ordered mango salad, pork fried with basil, green chicken curry, mixed vegetables, olive rice and pad thai, and got it within 15 minutes to go, and all for $45.The food was generally good, especially the minced pork and the mixed vegetables, which were crunchy yet cooked and very tasty.The only small negative, if that, was that the portions were small. Highly recommended if you are in the area

Good selection of food. Pad Thai has lots of ingredients. The main dishes were substantial. In our second visit, the Mixed veg dish was disappointing for $7 - only had slabs of white cabbage stem, few pieces of carrot slices, stems of kailan. Not sure why the standard had dropped in a matter of 2 days. Maybe, they were too busy. Lemongrass tea was too sweet

Visited and had dinner at this Thai restaurant.
Simple thai food non aircon restaurant in the residential neighbourhood. Tasty food at affordable prices.
Estimated about $16 per person for 2 course + dessert + drinks + dessert. Credit card accepted.

If you love thai food, this place is a must to try.
the pricing is decent for a thai restaurant.
love their thai ice milk tea

Don't know why their food are no longer as delicious as before.
They have change to letting you write down your order and pay at the counter.
No point visiting again only the price is cheap.

Food is not bad. Not the best but still better than some others. There's actually two shops selling Thai food at the same stretch. Different taste. See which you prefer. I just move around. :D

Been there couple of times but after today guess I won't return reason pineapple fried rice was tasteless and no sign of pineapple, green chicken curry was mainly coconut milk and fewer pcs of chicken. Hmm...kind of dissapointed. The Thai ice tea is over priced.

This eatery is still popular, even more so than the one a few doors down, and a short wait is the norm. We ordered prawn cakes, Thai kang kong, and garlic pork, and the first two were okay, but not exceptional. The garlic pork was just too salty and the pork was a little heavy going.We did love the olive rice, with its sliced shallots, cashew nuts and chilli.The Thai iced tea was pre-prepared and over diluted, while the calamansi juice was okay. Service was quick but without the usual Thai smiles. Many will still return here, especially students from the nearby schools, as the prices are reasonable. A meal for two cost $35

2 different Thai resturants along the same stretch. For me, I just move around. Tried most of the dishes as I stayed around the area. Prefer the Fried Kway Teow with Kailan over the Pineapple Fried rice as the latter taste rather..tasteless...? Overall, dishes are not bad, they provide free iced water and will drop by whenever craving for Thai food
5
There are two Thai restaurant along each other. Don't make a mistake of going to the wrong place. Both restaurants have similar names. This is Soi Thai Kitchen. Try their mango salad and Basil Chicken. It has outdoor seating. The place gets full easily so try to arrive around 6p

We wanted some Thai food for dinner but as it was drizzling, decided to pack the meal. On reaching home, the dishes were still good. We ordered olive fried rice, pineapple rice, minced beef with basil, tom yum goong and deep fried fishcakes. The majority of the dishes were tasty, though the minced beef was a little on the salty side. The meal for five of us cost around S$70

Have been eating for quite a few times and still taste as good as it is before. Price and service are good. Plus point- cheap, portion of food okay for a group of four on every dishes order, the staff are nice and always on a smiling approach, ice water are free and self service and they serve food fast. Week point- don't expect quality Thai food, expect queue in the night, don't take booking, the fish serve are deep fry and they don't have big table for big group Average Cost to eat per person between $6-$1

Tried at 4 times before. As always food is tasty and reasonable price. Tonight came with family of 4 and Ordered 5 dishes with a dessert of red ruby.
Total bill S$58.00

Passed by many times and today 1st time trying. Price reasonable and most important is yummy. Will visit more often from now on.

One of the best Thai food in Singapore and the service is wonderful. The cost of the food was also very reasonable. I enjoyed the Bandan Chicken and Tom yum soup.

Whenever my wife and I feel like a Thai food fix, we head over to this nice little Thai place. Authentic Thai food at good value for money prices. Do come early though as it gets busy especially on weekends.

Soi thai is located just behind my school (Temasek poly) so there will always be a lot of students dining there in between their breaks. The food there are really good and cheap, for the prices paid, the food are really considered top notch. Helps that the servers there are friendly too :)

Even with the relatively new Bangrak Thai eatery opening a few doors down, Soi Thai is still a firm favourite judging by the number of diners. Bangrak has a different pull - it has a liquor licence and can serve beer.We ordered stuffed chicken legs (so-so, and a little salty), Sweet and sour pork, Olive fried rice, Pad Thai, chicken with cashew, fried fish cakes and Tom Yum soup. Most of the dishes were still very tasty, especially the olive rice, pork and fish cakes. The Pad Thai was a little too sweet though. Service was quick - all our dishes arrived within 15 minutes

This is the second time we tried the foods. The first time was a few months back. The foods was not really nice, the portion are small and the ingredients are less. As we live nearby, we use to walk pass the shop and lately we notice there is always a long queues waiting for tables.So we decided to tried again lately, and YES, the taste have improved.The food is delicious and flavoursome and the portion sizes are just right. It's good value for money. The service is prompt and friendly. No long waiting times for orders

I can't say how many times I have been to Soi Thai because I would go there every time when I have cravings for Thai food!We would always order pandan leaf chicken for appetizer. The chicken is wrapped in pandan leaf and deep fried, it is served along with the sweet sauce. However, the chicken itself is already delicious without the sauce! For the main dishes, we had tried tom yum soup, stir fried kang kong in Thai style, green curry beef/chicken, minced pork with basil and olive fried rice. All of them are very tasty! The service is good and they don't make you wait so long for the dishes! We would definitely go back!

This was a surprising find amidst the HDB blocks, but it serves delicious and authentic Thai cuisine. Its popularity can be seen in the long queues even before the eatery opens at 6 pm. They do the usual Thai fare like pad thai, green curry, fish and prawn cakes and minced beef or pork with basil, but they do it well. Their olive and pineapple fried rice dishes are also must-trys. Staff are friendly, but the food might take a while to make it to your table due to the crowds. If you live nearby, take out is an option

 Soi Thai Kitchen has garnered a following. Even before the place opens at six in the evening, you can often see groups of people waiting for its shutters to open. The dishes have have improved in terms of taste and value since it first opened. The usual Thai favourites like tom yam soup, pad thai and sambal kang kong don't disappoint. A good place for authentic thai dishes if you're in the area but come early of be prepared to wait
