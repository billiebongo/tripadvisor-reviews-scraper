Fully covered and wonderful ceiling fans surround this place. Chairs are comfortable, they have a full bar with some delicious drinks and some lovely appetizers as well as a meal.

Great food. Lots of choices from local cuisine to Western Style food. The prices were reflective of Singapore, but you got a lot of food for the prices.

The buffet breakfast is at S$35/pax and the buffet dinner is at S$68/pax. The service is good but for the price that we are paying, not really worth it.
