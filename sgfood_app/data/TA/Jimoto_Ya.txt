One of the best dining experiences ever, staff were super friendly and sincere, the ramen served was one of the best ive ever had and a super reasonable price (no gst and service charge)

Service was exceptional, and the ramen tasted way different from the usual ones I eat at other jap restaurants. Will definitely be back!

Food was great and we visited with two toddlers. They were very nice to give us a private room. Excellent service. We would be back again.

The atmosphere was authentic and server was very friendly. Would love to come back here again! Perfect

Thick and flavourful ebi and pork broth. If you need slices of char siew in your ramen, then skip this. The cold ramen is an interesting dish. It is refreshing but a bit too oily for my liking.

Ramen was fantastic with great service from the crew. Nice cosy place. Will head back to try other items on the menu.

I really loved my visit to Jimoto Ya! I tried the whisky ramen in Dec 2017 and the infused whisky really brought out the natural Amaebi and Miso flavors and sweetness with a gentle alcoholic kick that is really smooth and addictive.The service was exceptionally good too and the owner really knows his stuff! I think I’ll be flying out to SG again soon just to get back to this superb restaurant ;

I tried the shoyu ebi ramen which taste strangely similar to sg style prawn mee albeit with a tinge of japan in it, while my gf tried the curry one. The ramen was good and from the money we saved using entertainer, we bought some gyoza to try too

My ramen was served an hour later after my orderly then I noticed there’s only one Chef. The restaurant wasn’t even full house. If you can’t handle the crowd, you shouldn’t have accept so many customers in the first place. To be honest, the ramen didn’t taste fantastic. Cold ramen was better than the soup one imo. The soup ramen (shio) tasted very much like Singapore’s prawn noodle soup

Interesting ebi broth. Like a modern japanese twist to our local prawn noodles. The dry ramen was light ans refreshing. Service was good and friendly staff. Enjoyed the lunch.

Love the food and ambience in Jimoto Ya. The service in the restaurant was really good too. Will definitely return.

Loved the prawn broth which was dizzyingly fragrant. Not so much the dry one that lacked flavours. Will return!

Good service from staff! Gyoza was great but nothing really fantastic about the Whiskey Ramen. Only had cabbages and some minced meat inside.

The service from Shaun was a delight. The whiskey infused ramen was delicious but you would need to make a reservation for the whiskey ramen . The set lunches were awesome

The combination of whisky with ramen is interesting and surprisingly smooth. The taste of the whisky is palatable in every mouthful. I seldom consume alcoholic beverages, hence I found the taste of the whisky to be strong and evident in the ramen. However, my boyfriend who is more familiar with alcohol found the taste diluted and light. Both of us found the ramen to be too oily for our liking. The air con was not switched on throughout the evening (i am unsure of the reason, but the fan was on at the side and doors were opened), and I could see many of the diners sweating. For those who purchased the ticket to try this ramen on Saucy, do let the staff know that u have paid for the ticket before u order, and please check your bill before you pay. The staff charged us an open bill of an additional $22 for the yamazaki whisky that was supposed to be included in the $28/bowl of ramen. We were shocked to see that the initial bill came up to $78 for 2 bowl of ramen which was supposed to cost only $56

D $28 limited edition bowl of Ebi Miso Ramen with 20ml of Fat-washed Yamazaki Whisky ! Didnâ€™t know that both ramen n whisky can work well together. The soup broth is delightfully sweet with a subtle tinge of smoky whisky flavour. The ramen was springy n I was surprised to find that it actually boosts a mellow sweet flavour instead of the usual eggy taste. Interesting to try this!

Ramen with a delightful, delicious twist - we couldn't get enough of the umami of the prawn broth. Service was friendly and charming, a cosy little place where you feel like family. The only complaint is that the entertainer voucher can only be used for a combination of one dry and one soup ramen, rather than two soup ramens. This wasn't what the voucher promised

the soup was rather too sweet.... as if it was mixed w sugar . Well, it was okay, but for $28 the expectation would be higher. Also i din manage to utilize the $10 voucher, still not sure how it works?? i asked the waiter she don knw about it

Love the ramen ! The ebi ramen noodles was so springy and the broth was amazing . Also tried the cold noodles, was refreshing and grea toot. However was quite disappointed to only redeem one hot and one cold ramen from entertainer app , with the strange explanation that they have limited 50 bowls of hot ramen a day. Hope they change this policy and I will be back again.
