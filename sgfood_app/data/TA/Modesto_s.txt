I like the pizzas here. Taste wise is very good. You can even share a pizza as it very big. The view is very nice also looking over the sentosa area!
4
Visited this restaurant after nearly a year and I would say that the standard is the same. The restaurant has an outdoor sitting that overlooks the harbour which I find it lovely and romantic.
1
Asked for a medium well filleto di Manzo. Came out cut in half and bloody. Did not have confidence in the chef to cook another one. Stated my complaint, waiter could see bloody steak. I will never come back here, except maybe for drinks. The one star is for the view
3
My first impression was: great ambience!Staffs were really attentive and friendly, ordered a mini pizza(Misto Carne), lobster spaghetti (Spaghetti Aragostine) and a Ravioli Funghi.Pizza was really good, mini looks small but it does fill you up! (for 2), spaghetti was decent but was not a fan of the ravioli funghi.. the ravioli filling was too liquidy, creamy, like biting into a dumpling filled with creamy blended mushroom soup, the sauce on the outside was alright, not a fan of the combination though. Would prefer a whole mushroom as the filling instead!Price was ok- a little on the high side. Would try their other menu items next time
5
Dined here a few times during our recent visit to Singapore and were made most welcome by their excellent friendly staff.Great location with the outside tables looking across the bay to Sentosa.The pizza is exactly as described thin based and extremely tasty and although they offer a variety of dishes the pizza was our favourite.Again thank you for the warmth of our welcome
5
We went there on Eatigo 50% and they also offered happy hour prices at 50% for beersc, wines and cocktails. Loved the Quattro stagioni pizzza, rack of lamb and the caprese as antipasti. We eat and drank a lot and the total bill was less than $100. As it was mid afternoon, there was no crowd and the service was good.

Modesto's is on my top list of restaurant's in Singapore. I have been living here for 5 years now and we have 10-15 visits each year. The experience starts right as you walk into the restaurant. The location being Vivo City is very helpful because as you come back from a tiring yet fun shopping trip or an eventful trip to Universal Studios, you walk into a nice and cool restaurant with a welcoming staff waiting for you. You have the option of a nice table in the air con or you can opt to go for the tables out on the terrace with a great and majestic view of Resorts World Sentosa. The menu has a variety of options including pizzas and pastas for everyone. The food is delectable and I love it a lot. Modesto's is a must visit restaurant and hopefully you enjoy it as much as I do
3
While in Vivo city and hungry do try out Modesto. This is not the best italian restaurant town but good bang for your buck. Any other place and you would have to shell out a lot for Italian food. I always try its aglio olio and penne arrabbiata. I find the place/ ambience far better than Jamie's italian and service is prompt. Sat night dinner waiting can be longer. It is good to enjoy a few drinks with your friends as well as it overlooks the bay
3
I have been coming here for a few years now because they have an extensive vegetarian selection. On my visit yesterday though i felt the quality of food and service has degraded alot.Staff looks tired and felt unwelcome. The had to be told on what to do and service was unfriendly without a smile.Garlic bread taste a day old and pasta was nothing great.Only thing the Pizza was still amazing.Really sad to see such a beautiful location with this sort of quality.Maybe a complete revamp in attitude is needed :
4
First time to this Modesto's at Vivocity. Beautiful view of Sentosa . Selection of food and quality was good.Large portions . A bit on the pricey side. Best to go with promo. .Liked the starters. Not impressed with Tiramisu and Macchiatto. The proof is always in the pudding.. Recommended thou for a day out..Especially a day afternoon is quiet and relaxing.
3
Nice location, very good craft beer, not so good for the food I'm afraid. For the price you pay, you would expect something closer to the real italian
4
We entertained our America guests in this Italian restaurant serving great food of pizzas. The price is mid range but fresh ingredients.
3
This was the only restaurant that wanted to serve us at 10.30pm.
Food was tasty and came quite fast - perfect for when you are hungry.
Dinner for two was not cheap.
4
The restaurant was pretty quiet when we arrived for dinner and to me, an empty restaurant means bad food or bad service or worse, both!We had 2 starters and 2 pastas and they are all very nice actually! A most satisfying meal indeed!We had:Prosciutto Ham and Melon - lovely combo of salty and sweet!! The cuts of ham were generous and the melon slices were so sweet! That equates to heavenly bites every bite! Very nice!Calamari - the batter was pretty bland but still crispy. Average nice. Bacon Carbonara - wonderfully creamy and the savoury bits of bacon made the overall taste very enjoyable. Seafood Linguine - am impressed with their seafood both in amount and freshness level. I am very happy with this pasta dish as the flavour is spot on and the tomato sauce is tasty. We will definitely be back for more yummy pasta
4
It is one of the good Italian restaurants in Singapore. The food is good and there is a plenty of vegetarian options as well. It is slightly pricey but the nice location justifies it. Try to find a seat in the open area on the back with a nice view of the sea and Sentosa island. Service is good too
4
Ordered Misto Carbe (regular) for sharing. Serving is good for 2 person, taste is nice but a bit salty with price tag of 28ã€‚Also try their calami, self very fast but the texture is soggy. Overall quality is below average. Not recommended.Also tried they cocktail, very mild.With mid-week discount of 30%, it will back to try their pasta again. I tried it during my last visit, they are fantastic. I hope they can keep up with their food quality. Service wise is not exceptional, not very attentive but no significant delay on our order. I will rate is acceptable.
4
Met up for a meal with a bunch of ex colleagues over xmas.Great family styled restaurant suitable for larger groups and families.We shared everything which made all the more better in the sense we got to eat a lot of different stuff.Good stuff:Seafood marinara pastaVongoleChicken wing basketsAny Pizza-thin crust- wood fired ovens.My favourite is the quatro formaggi.Good value overall
4
Modesto's was quite a revelation in terms of choice and flavour in the vegetarian department. Most places have a Caprese and a couple of standard Pasta-Pizza selections for non-meat eaters, but here was a veritable treasure! We had Eggplant Parmigiana to start with and for mains, the Mushroom Ravioli in Walnut & Saffron sauce. The sauces were insanely flavourful, and there was no skimping on the portions either. I'm definitely going back to try some of the other delicious sounding stuff they have on the menu
3
Came here for a mid-week lunch with the Mrs. We had the linguine Modesto, a seafood pasta loaded with prawns, clams and squid, and the pizza Misto Carne which was full of salami and sausages. They were all nice, but prices I felt were not so modest - Be prepared to pay about $60-$80 per couple
5
Been to Modesto's at Vivo City twice during weekdays for dinner. They have an ongoing OCBC credit card 30% discount for ala carte items (Monday to Wednesday).The menu is quite extensive for food and beverages. Must try the fried chicken wings with their special made chilli sauce. It's really tasty! Also ordered pizza, pasta, fish and chips. Everything is good! The restaurant is separated into three sections, the upper floor for family dining, lower section for friends' gathering and drinking sessions, and the outdoor seating area with a good view of Sentosa island. Service is generally good. Would definitely recommend this place
2
The twice I've been here ive been disappointed. First I had a very soggy pizza and the second time I ordered lasagne and it was not fresh, it had been microwaved, not to my taste.
4
My first visit to any Italian restaurant. And I must say that I just fell in love with this food here.
Do not miss to order Canneloni Spinaci.
1
We paid $62 for Pizza, French fries, cup of tea and a dessert. The pizza was awful, quite salty and very wet.. The dessert was quite dry and tasteless. As it was a Chinese new yr dinner, we didn't want to fight...
2
After a wonderful visit to the Orchard Parade Hotel outlet a few months ago, I decided to get my pasta fix at the Vivocity branch. I ignored the warning sign of the large restaurant being completely empty save for 3 tables while every other restaurant on the rooftop of Vivo was packing a full house. Sat down and ordered a Tagliolini Manzo and it arrived smelling truffley and delicious, just as I remembered it. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce was delectable. However, the cubes of beef tenderloin it arrived with were absolutely horrid. They tasted like they'd been boiled, flavourless and rubbery on the outside. I couldn't get half of the beef down, and I made it a point to let the waitress know when the bill arrived. She thanked me for the feedback and said she'd let the kitchen know. I still paid full price for the meal - at $40 this was an expensive pasta and I could've gotten a well rounded pasta/meal at hundreds of other restaurants in Singapore. At the prices they charge, service could also have been much better. Would not return
4
Went there recently with some family friends. Generally the food was good, the price reasonable. It was a family friendly restaurant as kids were left alone without complains despite being a touch noisy. Assume the place was big enough so the the kids noise didn't distract or disturb the other customers. There was space for in-restaurant dining and Al-fresco which was good. Kids enjoyed the food and so did the adults
4
We dined here on a Monday evening. They have indoor and outdoor seating, but due to the heat, we opted for indoor. We were there early, around 7 pm and the place was relatively empty. However, most tables were already booked via reservations. There were two tables left for us and we were quickly seated. The menu has an extensive list of pizzas, which most of my party opted to try. The pizzas are thin-crust, just to my liking. A mini was just right for one person. I finished off the meal with tiramisu...delicious! Very reasonable price, too. Overall good experience, topped with friendly and attentive service
1
This is mediocre food at gourmet prices, and is well worth a skip. Prices are high and the food is not up to the mark. The pastas we had, mushroom ravioli and four cheese gnocchi, both had a 'mechanical' or diesel undertones to them. Not worth the effort
2
Firstly, the restaurant is located inside Vivo city and the view is great as you can oversea Resort World Sentosa. However, the food is very average, french fries are quite salty though and the salad dressing is normal. We had ordered a pizza, spring chicken, dessert and drinks. The price is quite costly for a low grade food though, not really recommended though. We didn't managed to finish our food though
5
This place has a deck on the harbour front with the view of the sea, mono-rail to Sentosa and the view of the Sentosa island itself. In addition it has happy hours where all drinks including bottloe of wine are priced half.Just loved the view, food & wine. Must visit
4
One of the biggest benefit this place has is the location. It oversees the Sentosa island and if you manage to get outdoor seating on the weekend, you would love the view especially at night. The food was just about good, the pastas and the pizzas. Do note that the quantity per dish is pretty substantial. The cocktails are good as well
4
It is no problem to eat alone here. Good alternative to room service for the solitary traveller. Pizza is the option to go for.
3
Ok food but too expensive for what you get. Appetizers are great to have! Good when going for a quick lunch. Pizza have a thin bottom but are overpriced.
4
While on our Singapore trip we visited this branch of Modestos with our cousin who stay here. Food was delicious , ambience was great and we had a great time. Service was good and we had to wait for a while till the table was available.Ordered badsic italian fare of pizzas and pastas which were tasty and portions were also good
2
Even before i Walk in , i am told in a very Brash tone "last order now sir " . literally having to decide appetizers and main course at the same time .it ain't a few mins later than 930pm that i went in .Attitude and general body language at least Seemed like , if you guys chomp quickly ,we could shut shop for the night Just lost all the liking and the respect i had for this place from my earlier experience at clarkes qua
3
Put new cheese on an old stale pizza and served, was ok if you are hungry enough Location is very nice, nice restaurant and excellent service, pretty pitiful they would serve old pizza, even dominoes does not do that For the price , you expect better food
4
We went for a successful celebration with customers on 19 Nov 15 at Vivocity, 3rd floor. This was my first time to new location on the roof top. They used to located on 1st floor near Harbourfront area. We enjoyed ourselves very much especially the restaurant manager have recommended for good choice of appetizer, pizza, finger food beforehand so that we did not need to wait till 1 hour of hunger. Staff were friendly. All of us were very pleased with the food and dessert. Nice ambience for family, couples and busines
3
We had pizza here after a long stay at Vivocity mall and after queuing up for over 30min (seemed to be a rush for dinner around 1900 and place was crowded). Since it was raining and full we did not sit outside, but I checked the view which is indeed nice. Service was quick and friendly, no complaints. The Diavola pizza was very fatty and not spicy at all, felt more like a standard salami pizza. Nothing special. The apple crumble also was rather standard. So the food is the reason for three stars. Good seating outside but else nothing to get excited about.
1
I really like the food as it is one of the best italian places which has a great view and good vegetarian food. But my dining experience is always marred by the rude and insensitive behaviour of the staff. There is no warmth in their service and they never allow the guest to choose a table even when the entire restaurant is empty. if you have any table preferences, you are always informed that any table you choose is already "reserved" - which means u sit in the corner allotted to you by the waiter. One time i pressed for a particular table because it was neither occupied nor reserved and I was informed that if I sat there the service to me will be slow. enough said
1
i used to love this place. the view overlooking the harbor and Sentosa, the ocean breeze and its location at the most accessible shopping mall in sg, made it the perfect place to relax after a long day at work or for an evening coffee on a weekend.lately, however my experience has been horrible. the service staff acts like a bunch of idiots who have no interest in serving you or to make your stay any enjoyable at all. especially there is one specific guy (clean shaven, tall) on many occasions, when asked for a specific table, we were told by him that all places except the one he was offering us were booked, which clearly they were not. the way he talks is borderline rude. still, the place still has its pluses in terms of location and almost decent food. my advise, if you are looking for a pleasant time,please take a good luck charm with you to this place.
4
I will always come here to order their pasta and pizza. You can ask for more pasta sauce which is great. You can also try their dessert (Tiramisu) if you still have space in your stomach after the main course. They have happy hours if you like to have a beer
4
Love their food, especially their vongole. The best vongole pasta in Singapore! Whenever I go to an Italian restaurant and vongole in the menu, I'm always curious to try it. Theirs is so far the best (even compared to Angelo's of Mulberry St in NY)!
4
The restaurant is beautiful and has a very nice view of Santosa. But the best thing about it is the Pizza.We tried the Bolognese Pizza and fell in love with the idea.Wood fired pizza with Bolognese sauce and cheese.We did have French Fries and 2 drinks with the pizza but $42.37 is a bit much.Look don't get me wrong I will go back but don't take the kids to a place like this its more for business and adults
2
The best thing about Modestos is the view. I had to wait at the hostess stand for someone to finally seat me. Then they just motioned from the back anyway. The pizza looked good. However there was barely a stain of pizza sauce on it. They charge for water even when you order other drinks. Pizza was barely ok and the service cold and unfriendly. By the way this was lunchtime and there were just a few tables with people at them.
4
Hidden on rooftop near sky garden and just opposite Marche. The waiters tend to let guests sit at the back of the restaurant near Sentosa so that guests can get good view. This gave a wrong impression that the restaurant was empty as the tables at front part of restaurant were not occupied. Service - perhaps it's new trainee who are foreigner., they don't understand my request so another waiter took over. Generally very eager to clear our plates due to number of staffs on duty. Food: calamari was average but the pizza and pasta i ordered before were good.this was my 2nd visit as the price is quite expensive however came in large portion
4
Was there for dinner alone so took the high chair table. Very nice view of Sentosa and the place is quaint. They serve good Gin for the happy hour price. Ordered Cannelloni Spinaci (Spinach Lasagne) and it was love at first taste, rich cream and a lot of spinach and cheese. But the price is steep for the food items, pastas are priced $20 and above the, the Cannelloni was $28++. Would go again if there is promotion or vouchers otherwise its overpriced
3
I always wanted to check out this place and I finally decided to give it a shot instead of Jamie's Italian, my usual dinner place at Vivo. We went little early before the dinner crowd started to pour in on a Friday night. They had extensive pizza varieties on the menu but they didn't mark those vegetarian choices. We ordered bruschetta and garlic bread while waiting for the wood fired four cheese pizza to arrive. The garlic bread and bruschetta were okay. The pizza was just average too. The crust was little soggy! Ordered virgin pina colada and ice lemon tea too and they were okay too. I find the food items are overpriced. For the quality of food served, the price is not justified. There are plenty of other pizza speciality places serving much better pizzas for the same or less price.
2
Came here for dinner and ordered linguine modesto's and fusili boscaiola pasta.My husband got a seat with a great view of sentosa Island. Awesome location. The food was akin to canned tomato paste or mushroom cream cheese. I'm sure anyone could've whipped up such a meal with instant pastes from the supermarket. Tourist note, linguine modesto's was spicy beyond normal. I'm a Tom yum, curry, chilli padi lover yet still found the dish spicy. Had to get it changed to make edible. They simply washed off the sauce and returned my original plate of pasta.If you have to come, try lunch as their lunch deal prices are more reasonable.
5
Have been a few times now to this new Modesto's and I love the food and the environment. Modesto's is now perched on the top floor of Vivocity with a spectacular view over towards Sentosa. A spacious balcony offers a choice to dine outside or inside. The food is consistently good, whether you opt for pizza, pasta or entree style. But my favourite is their rigatoni puttanesca - delicious, nutritious and with just the right amount of chilli. Happy hour provides a good selection of wines at very reasonable prices. Service is prompt, efficient and courteous
3
My family and I dined at this restaurant and found it to be just about average. the food wasn't tasty, but the location is quite nice - overlooking sentosa. That's just about the only attraction of this restaurant. I had asked for aglio olio and told them to go a bit easy on garlic - voila, it came with a ton of garlic! water is chargeable and am not sure I am in a hurry to go back there again. There are certainly better Italian restaurants in Singapore
5
Had a seafood pasta which came with abundant amount of seafood and the sauce was so GOOD! The portion were big enough for 2 person. Husband and friends had a baked rice and a pizza. They commented that their food was great as well. Would love to visit again when I'm craving for pasta
2
Food here is horrible. Pizza Hut pizza is much better. Calamari is over cooked. Rib eye steak tastes stale. Will never come back.
4
We are here for dinner. We took a table outside with a fantastic view in Sentosa. Really a pleasant surprise. We enjoyed the good food and the great view.
3
Tipical italian food but medium quality. Very expensive for Asian place. To refresh the people the restaurant use the atomized water that coming from up.
1
Very simply the food here is poor and not worth the effort. Unlike the vast majority of restaurants they also refuse to provide tap water to drink. The service was also nothing to write home about.
4
Great pizza, very fast efficient and friendly staff. 30% off for happy hour was limited to a few choices, but in saying that there was something for everyone. We will be back.
4
My husband and I ate here as we were dying for Italian after two weeks of Asian food. We were not disappointed. I had the pasta arrabiata and my husband had the salmon penne. We also enjoyed some lovely chilled white wine. The food was delicious as evidenced by our clean plates. We did wish they served bread. You could purchase bruschetta or garlic bread but we wanted plain bread. All in all a very pleasant dining experience
5
LIKE: quiet for sure when we reached late post lunch hours. so opted a table in the terrace... lovely overcast, cool winds, chilled beer and crispy veg pizza. LOVED IT. Great staff - keep it up!!! suggestion: provide for warm bread with olive oil while guests wait for their pizza. its a little time consuming wait to get the crispy wood baked pizza on the table...!!!
5
We recently had lunch at Modesto's and simply enjoyed it !!. The pastas were a good size and very tasty as were the pizza's. The whole family enjoyed the environment, view and service. Would fully recommend it she your starving and looking to satisfy your pizza / pasta cravings
1
While we were happy to wait for an available table given that you were fully booked, we were not prepared to be treated in a callous manner - you DO NOT invite us to step into the restaurant to view your high table and then be told to wait outside for that table to be vacated - in heavy rain no less. The tables that have been reserved were ALL VACANT for the next half an hour - so the least you could have done was to invite our family of four (with two young kids in tow), to take a seat at one of those vacant tables while waiting for the high table to be vacated. We SHOULD NOT have to request for it. It was obvious that you did not value our patronage and it certainly didn't matter to you that we were frequent customers. No matter. Nothing can make me step into your premise EVER again.
4
It is in a great location on orchard road,so while shopping or waiting for someone else shopping this place is perfect. I participate that they have 2 coffee machines, one for Italians and one for others. Definitely I will be eating there often in the next few weeks while here on business
5
I've been meaning to try Modesto for some time and always ended up next door at the Angus Steak house, but after this gorgeous food tonight it'll be Modesto for me. The bruschetta starter is laden with garlic and for main the prawn spaghetti al olio with chilli is to die for. Loved it, and decided to go all in for the Tiramasu, yabadabadoo. Lovely food, compliments to the chef.Enjoy Orchard road. Fab. ;
5
Me & my Wife were at Modesto's for a couple of dinners or so, on Feb 2007 (still there was not Tripadvisor!) while we were on honeymoon. We simply found out Modesto's fantastic, astonishing: not only the best italian restaurant outside Italy, probably one of our best ever... Hopefully it's still like that nowaday
3
We've frequented Modesto's before it moved to the current location at Level 3 of Vivocity. They used to serve freshly-baked bread before the dinner which we used to enjoy. They don't serve that anymore after they moved to the current location. Modesto's has a wide variety of pizzas. We've tried different sorts of pizza and we were quite happy with it. The last time we went there we ordered pasta instead, Lasagne and Gnocchi. We were both quite pleased with it. Modesto's offers 30% off on all alcoholic beverages during their happy hour
5
I would highly recommend a trip to Modesto's in Vivo. Since they've relocated to the third level (#03 - 11) they now have a great outlook over the water towards Sentosa with loads of outdoor seating. The staff is what makes Modesto stand out for us. It's not always easy to find good service in Singapore, but Modesto's staff is in a class of its own. Each time we've left the restaurant we've had at least three people tell us goodbye - they really go the extra mile.They have an expansive menu and the friendly staff is more than happy to help answer questions. We're vegan and they were quite happy to ask the kitchen about what ingredients certain items had which was greatly appreciated.They also have a full bar to help compliment the stunning view. A great place to grab a drink or a bite to eat
4
The one I went to was at the end of Orchard Road and this review is based on just the first experience.- loads of options for vegetarians! You will find at least 4 wood burnt pizzas in the menu.- very good service. You can customize and get your own veg pizzasSome pointers:- Pizzas are thing crust- Mini (8 inch) pizza costs at least SGD 20- OCBC Bank card holders were getting 30% off on Tuesday's and 10% on other days!Free:A big cup of sugar syrup comes for free with an iced coffee! Who would need so much of sugar
3
The chain of restaurants is spacious, so you should not have a problem with seats. However, the pizza was really not up to the standards I expect, even if I lower my expectations. For some reason, I have no idea why they were so stingy on the tomato base when it would provide the pizza with much more flavour. The wood fired effect on the pizza also seem to be not like the ones I had in Italy
4
Been to Modesto's at Vivo City, Singapore twice and ordered the same dishes both times as the kids love their pizza and we do not eat pork. The restaurant is rather spacious and not as busy as other restaurants we've been to. The Seafood pasta is delicious. It's a bit of a mess eating the blue swimmer crabs that come with the dish so I would avoid it if you're trying to impress your date. Otherwise, go for your life. A place for a lazy Sunday lunch or brunch.
1
We were told it was a great Italian restaurant and we ordered pizza and garlic and oil pasta. The pizza was terrible, no flavor, the bottom was burned and I had better frozen pizza. We were told that drinks were 50% off so we ordered Singapore Slings; they were okay. The pasta smelled delicious but it had so much garlic, we were not able to finished. The bill came and the drinks were not 50% since were not guess of the hotel. Overall it was a terrible experience
1
I went thinking of having a normal lunch, not fancy and I knew it would be expensive, but I was expecting decency. I ordered prosciutto and melon and fettuccine with lobster. the prosciutto was decent but the melon was not freshly cut and was very mushy. Then the pasta came, with a few small pieces of what could have been shrimps meat, not lobster for sure, and a ton of sliced "burned" garlic. Now, I understand that in a chain like this you should not expect excellence, although the price I paid was $66, but to make a plate of pasta like this is an absolute careless effort that spells only one thing: I don't care about you
3
It was lovely enough, the outlet at Vivocity - complete with white linen table cloths and one could choose the Sentosa sea view if seated alfresco. We chose to dine indoors, though.We ordered our favorite "half-moon shaped" (giant curry puff lookalike / pizza folded into half) Calzone - named Calzone Farcito in this case. It was filled with the great ingredients such as cheese, pork ham, mushrooms, artichoke and complemented with tomato sauce. The crust was thick, but crispy; and tasted like a giant piece of graham crackers, which tasted wonderful with the tastebud-arresting ingredients enclosed within it.Then the Seafood Risotto (Risotto Alla Pescatora) was served. I just cannot get enough of the longish, chewy rice used to cook risottos, even though I am an anti-carbo person. The fresh and generous portions of prawns, sqiuds, mussels and clams tossed in a tomato-based sauce was simply divine. Every bite was satifying, bursting with the bounciness of fresh seafood, the exotic blend of seafood and tomato sauce. See, from the photo herein? The entire dish is bursting with seafood.

Strategic location in the heart of Orchard Rd. Good pizza and comes with loads of chili flakes and parmesan cheese, good service. Reasonable price. Will visit again :)
2
Bad Service, seemed miffend at having to work..insisted on me to order bread. Food everage.but pizza is not good.......
4
After 3 days of local hawker food we were craving pizza & salad. Modesto's didn't disappoint - food was great, service even better!! Pizza bases were thin & crispy just as they should be and salad was fresh. Thanks Modesto's, we'll be back!!
5
I had wood fired Pizza and it was fabulous and the service was also good. Price is little on the higher side otherwise it was a nice experience.
4
Modesto's was on the way back to our hotel so we stopped off for an early dinner. What a great choice. We ate out of doors and enjoyed excellent pizzas from the wood burning oven - the flavours were great. We were there at around 6.30 p.m. but the place filled up very quickly and before too long people were either queueing or turning away. The service is efficient and friendly and we considered the restaurant a lucky find
4
Since I last reviewed Modesto’s they closed the place on the 1st floor and reopened on the top floor of Vivo (the “open” floor with installation art and paddling pools - almost opposite Marche) The views in this location are always great but there was a really nice atmosphere up here away from the hurly burly of Vivo. The décor is nice and more stylish than before. The outside seating area is very attractive and nice and breezy at this level. I just hope they are able to maintain customer flow cos I can’t imagine they get much passing trade. The food was good – the kids had Penne Bolognese and I had Quattro Stagioni pizza – all delicious, as ever. Consistency of quality in this sort of place is so important, otherwise you might as well make it at home, right? At time of writing they have only recently reopened so there are quite a few discounts available – 30% off drinks in Happy Hour – “Frequent Customer Card” that gets you 20% off Mon-Thu and 15% off at weekends. I really hope it works out for them. It’s a nice place
4
Bruchetta was brilliant. $4 for two slices - you must get. I really enjoyed it!Server was a little to be desired though.... Even with a note book and pen he could not remember the order?! And had to ask 3 or 4 times (after he had gone to place order in POS). A friend then added to the order and asked for "one of what he had". The server didn't know what it was but worse; he informed it was something else! WOW! BIG FAIL. Otherwise; 5 stars
4
went there to watch a football match. ordered a mini pizza and drinks. for $15 plus, the pizza size was reasonable and the taste is fantastic! wished we had ordered a larger size! will be back with bigger appetite! service staff could improve their attitude a little though
4
We have been going to Modesto's on Orchard Road for years now and have always been impressed by the quality of their wood friend pizzas and authenticity of their pastas. The 4 cheese pizza is a must as is their fusili pink sauce pasta and cannelloni. We were saddened to find out that Modesto's no longer provides their house bread or tap water. It seems a very extreme cost cutting measure. Overall, the food and service is great, please bring back the house bread!
4
this is very good italian restuarant in orchard road the staff so nice i order my favorite dish of pizza and by mistake they bring another oneand when told them they quickly took it with nice polite apology and bring the original onethe location good - prices reasonable for being in singapor
4
The thin-crusted pizza is very tasty with just the right amount of ingredients on top. Ravioli with nuts is a very unique dish. Ordered other sides which completed our meal to our hearts content. Keep up with the good food!
4
We like the thin crust of Modesto who started business in KL 20 years ago.
The pizza is wonderful with thin crust and generous toppings.
For chili lovers go for Diavola.
4
Visited the place with my family. Very prompt service to go with the perfect Italian food. Pastas, Pizzas, and to end with the Tiramisu. Awesome food. My kids had food there for two consecutive days. Must visit.

Food came very quickly so ideal if you are in a hurry, it was pretty average, but no problems. Last time I was here I had the seafood special which was excellent,this time it was calamari and bolognese. Quite expensive for what you get.m

Iced tea warm. Pizza not well good. Buratta cheese was ice cold on the lower half and warm on the top. Espresso was good. The service was poor for the most part. Disdain best describes my waiter's attitude. Other staff ok. Keep on walking down orchard. Many other good places for an overly priced meal.

Arrived late and hungry. Ordered family pizza, it was huge, and one regular, which was more than enough for our family of 5 plus baby. If you order sundries tomatoes you get loads of thin, quite chewy thin strips. I like sundries tomatoes but this was a bit too much. However good quality and tasty pizza

We weren't able to take the opportunity to dine for lunch nor dinner at Modesto's but we enjoyed the breakfast buffet served for the hotel guests of Orchard Parade Hotel at the Modesto's.We felt at home with the cool, homey and a little bit romantic ambiance. It would be a good treat if one would take dinner at Modesto's . . . . perhaps some pizza and wine for the night . . . pasta? I can't say for I still have to grab a chance for a petite dinner with them.Our breakfast I believe were a combined effort of the Orchard Parade Hotel and Modesto's. The buffet was well prepared and very sumptuous to look at. It sure was visually appetizing to see the buffet spread . . . and I just had to come back for seconds for a very hearty breakfast meal to start our day on our 3 day vacation in Singapore

We have always been regulars at Vivo city Modesto and love their spaghetti, risotto, pizzas and appetizers. Especially the portobello mushroom, seafood soup with broccoli, risotto. Awesome service but rather hard to get the servers' attention when it's full. Great value for money and pls make reservations
5
Wanted to find a pleasant place to share a relaxing but entertaining atmosphere. We got just that at Modesto's. Service was above average. Atmosphere was great, the energy there was overall a great experience. I had the spaghetti carbonara .. Very good and when they mean al dente, they mean it to a T. Next time I will ask for a little longer in the boiling water. My husband ordered the lasagna. It was tops. I had a Shirley temple and my hubby had a beer. We enjoyed great food and good laughs. For dessert we ordered the gelato. It was a perfect end to a perfect evening.

Def the best pizza I've tried for agesMost 'Italian' pizzerias in London would eat their hearts out once they've tried modesto's pizzaWent with a few friends and was told that the pizza here is goodPizza in Singapore good? You've gotta be kidding me!No way, I'm playing safe and having the baby chicken I said!My dish was amazingly tasty and cooked just rightSo I was offered a 'bite' out of someone else's pizzaDamn was it good!I regretted having not trusted my friendsThe service can be slowish with a lack of interest but it seems that most places here are like thatBut I'm definitely going back again for the pizzaAs for the prices, if we keep comparing them to UK prices then yes they seem expensiveBut wait this is Singapore!:

Modesto's is located on Orchard road, its an italian restaurant, nothing special. The food is average, service is good but its expensive. I did not enjoy the pizza's, the bruchetta starter wasnt bad but all in all the meal was average.
4
Great food, prices a little to the expensive side, however the taste and size makes up for it.. Customer Service was very good as well

I have been going to Modesto's, Orchard Road, for over 13 years whenever I visit Singapore. My recent visit, on a Saturday evening, was an extremely poor experience. I think the whole place needs a makeover - it is looking tired and worn out and the big screen showing Premier football does nothing for the general atmosphere. Drink is expensive, even by Singapore standards, the food is OK - when you get it. The maddening thing about this visit was the complete and utter lack of interest by the staff. They walked around (there are more than enough of them) looking at the floor, rather than at tables. After being shown to a table we waited 10 minutes before being offered even a drink - the place wasn't busy. After our first course, no plates were cleared and it was a further 30 minutes before pizzas showed up - the waiter not knowing the first thing about customer service - expecting us to move our first-course plate so that he could serve the second. Staff training and customer service - absolute zero
5
Everytime we want reliably a good wood over fired pizza, we would go to Modesto's. This now over more than 10 years (the one next to the Orchard Hotel). They also added some excellent salads in addition to the usual ones. Good is also there is seating inside and outside (for those who do not like to freeze in the aircon). Staff is attentive, we like it
5
We stayed at the associated Orchard Parade hotel and chose to eat outside at this restaurant. We selected the Seafood Linguini dish and were amazed at the meal. It was oven-cooked in foil and was awash with a good selection of seafood including a crab. It was both tasty and excellent value. Service was also very good. I can recommend this place for a good meal and service
2
I had dinner here as I was walking down the street and was looking for something different this night than the Asian kitchen. As the place was looking quite decent and I like Italian I went in and had my dinner here. Service was good and relative fast.I choose the antipasti appetizer and after a pizza quatro stagoni.... Both were far from exciting and were missing the fresh, authentic Italian flavour. The pizza bread is more resembling to cardboard then nice crispy pizza bread.All in all I was not impressed with this place, location and atmosphere is good but I will avoid this place next tim
3
Modesto is in my point of view the classic Americanized Italian restaurant, big portion, but not authentic.I had a simple pasta from the a la carte menu, and the pasta was overcooked and not tasty at all.Even my friend meal was far from exciting.The pizza looked good, eventhough I didnt have the chance to try i
4
Decided to chill out with a Tiger and a pizza at the Orchard Road location, which was very good indeed, will order the large one next time. Great spot to people watch and spend an hour. Service was prompt and simply good value given the locatio
5
We have been visiting this restaurant for the past 14 years. They have maintained attentive service with a smile, combined with good down to earth food at reasonable prices. This is a nice place for a relaxed meal and watching the passing people. Ordered the Spaghetti al Olio, Pepperoncini and garlic - the best I had in a long time anywhere. If weather is not too hot or humid we recommend the open air area. Unless you are looking for a ''fine dining'' experience and ambiance, we can highly recommend this restaurant
2
Good selection of pasta and pizza, limited wine list (don't bother). Food is on high side, but it is to be expected because of location. Great outdoor to watch people. Service staff are attentive but they aren't that friendly and don't smile. Not a great place to hang out. But good for quick dinner and go
4
We had the house specialty. ..modesto seafood pasta for two and it was fantastic and excellent value for money. Atmosphere was nice sitting outside and watching the world go by. Staff were a bit dis organised but pleasant. Would go again.
5
We visited the one at Vivo City. The service was very good and the ambience pleasant. The food was also nice.The prices are at par with any other decent restaurant.
5
We go there regularly now, helped by the fact that they keep giving us 2 4 -1 vouchers. Totally love their pizzas though, and staff are great. Go before 9pm for best drinks deals.
4
Pizza is fine and reasonably priced! Brownie is a delight! Good spot if you don't want to go anywhere fancy and chill out
4
My wife and I decided to go explore the restaurants in Vivocity and ended up in Modesto's. The restaurant was quite packed when we arrived. Fortunately, there were two vacant seats for couple dining so we did not have to wait long.We order mini Bruciaculo Pizza and a Linguine Vongole to share. We enjoyed the Bruciaculo. The chili provided a jolt but it was quite tasty. Vongole was generous with clams. They also had a happy hour on Saturday's though their drinks seem overpriced to start with. All in all a good place to have dinner
4
Large Italian restaurant with wide oceanfront view. Authentic cuisine - pizza had thin cripsy crust which is how I like it (I think you can get deep pan though if that is what you prefer). It took us a couple of visits to get the hang of ordering - share a regular pizza and pasta dish and salad between 4. Portions are large. Do it that way and it is good value. It is a large noisy restaurant so good for large noisy groups/families - not really the place for a romantic meal for two
2
Had the chicken roasted dish. Which you can't get well done. Only one way so that tells me it's just pre pre made. We also had mushroom pasta in cream. Tasted okay. Served on flat plate which is a first. Lots of butter inside. Pineapple juice tasted like syrup mixed with water. Or just watered down. Pepsi. Well was pepsi :) Will not come back unless really really desperate for late night meal. Might go to nearby coffee club instead.
3
We went to Modesto's Vivo City at 2pm on a Sunday. Pasta was flavorful and pizza was excellent. The staff made an effort to serve the kids meal first which was commendable. The kids enjoyed the food tremendously. The service was prompt but it was odd the staff were not smiling(??!!), an area for improvemen

This restaurant was on the ground floor of the hotel I was staying in (The Elizabeth hotel). I ordered some soup and pasta when I arrived at the hotel to help recover from the jet lag. It was very tasty! I could the ingredients used were fresh and the dishes were very yummy. I ordered freshly squeezed orange juice (very pricey as it was $10 US) too which was good. On another day I ordered pasta and pizza - both were very good but again, on the pricey side of about $60 US for the 2 dishes. I would recommend this restaurant as a treat but not for everyday dining. There are hawker centres close by that offer the same (and more authentic to Singapore) dishes for half the price. Oh and there was one day when I ordered freshly squeezed pineapple juice and they brought me boxed juiced in a glass. My trained palate could tell it wasn't fresh plus there was no fresh foam on the top. I would've been charged $10US for boxed juice had I not felt something was wrong. I had it replaced. If you like freshly squeezed juice, though, I HIGHLY recommend you visit a hawker centre like Newton where you can get juice for about $3US. I did like that they would slice the mangos I bought in the market for me every morning
4
This place has good wood fired pizza with the thin crust reminiscent of flammchuchen in Germany. The only thing about this place is they are proud of their food. I got a mini and it was enough to fill the void and topped off with a beer and the bread and olive oil/balsamic dip they bring made it enough to keep the body chemistry in check. They have a choice location which probably makes it easy to charge what they do. $17 for a mini pizza is outrageous but they can get it
3
Nothing is wonderful there but a nice terasse on Orchard road is rare...
As long as you don't expect much, you wont be disappointed...
Pizzas are good, pasta are ok... Worth a try if you are in the neighborhood...
4
Food is consistently good, reasonably priced, good service, always available, and nice relaxed ambience. Worth more than 1 visit. Distinctive calamari! Thin crust pizza, and although can be a little wet, nice calzone. Strange no Hawaian pizza though
4
Good Cannelloni Spinaci and Casoncelli served with a nice smile. The Carpaccio Rucola is a little too oily for my taste and they don't know how to mix a Dry Martini.
Nice location for people watching whist you eat and priced right for the location.
5
Being an Amici member, my family and I love Mad Mondays at Modesto's, where pizzas and a selection of pastas are available at $9.90 instead of the usual prices from $18 upwards. The food is such tremendous value at this price! We start off our family dinners at Modesto's with a gratis basket of house foccacia, served with a cocktail of olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We then order our staple favorites - spinach cannelloni, pink sauce rigatoni, funghi pizza and a quatro formaggi pizza. The cannelloni is divine - filled with spinach and ricotta mixture and topped with creamy white sauce and a dash of tomato sauce! The pizza is made in a wood fired oven and is thin and crispy, with generous helpings of cheese. Not forgetting the tiramisu which is spongy and moist with layers of mascapone goodness. Indoor seating has a slightly more formal vibe, and the outdoor terrace is ideal for relaxing and people watching along Orchard Road. Here's to many more more Mondays at Modesto's
4
Very good service, Pizza was good although as previously stated toppings were limited to "gourmet" pizzas. Spaghetti bolognese was very well presented. Had a sling here for S$9 during "happy hour" rather than the S$30 at the long bar raffles Hotel. Very good with teh kids, as every place we have visited
3
We had a pizza with friends at Modesto's and it was not too bad but also not very good. The problem probably relies in the ingredients they use, not the right ones for a good pizza.We ordered also some bruschetta but it was done in a strange way and the taste was something else. The service is good and the place is quite nice inside, while outside is ok.We finally have spend about S$35 per person, with only three of us having a beer: a bit too much, in my opinion
3
Modesto's is a step above fast food Italian, but don't expect to be too impressed. The restaurant offers a nice selection of antipastos, pastas, and pizza and the quality and portion size are fine. It's a decent value for the price. If you're looking for a quick meal at a reasonable price, check out Modesto's, but if your looking for a great culinary experience try somewhere else.
4
Went yesterday for lunch with my boys. It's not as crowded as other places in Vivocity on a Sunday. Few servers seem to make the place seem rather busy. The range of food items on menu were plenty. They have nice pasta options and a kids menu. The kids' pizza was a tad big for my 5 year old. We has the Modesto's signature pasta for 2 with lots of seafood ( too much clams if u ask me) which has prawns , crab and mussels in a tangy tomato based mix. I think the pizzas and starters will have been nice if we could afford to eat anymore. Will try these at my next visit.
3
Friendly service and wide variety of pizza options. My napolitano pizza (which has anchovies) was very salty - yes I know anchovies are always salty but these seemed noticeably saltier than average. My wife had a seafood pasta dish which was daunting in volume - I think the portion size would have put me off. Cheap wine is available but not really worth bothering with. Pity there is not a more upmarket Italian in vivo-city
4
This restaurant serves quality Italian food, but not cheap. Location is fantastic at the end of Orchard road. you can sit outside, a bit set back of the bustling life on Orchard Road.Pizza and Spaghetti are very good - house wine ok. All that does not come cheap, but in Singapore nothing is cheap. Still one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore
3
Nice pizza. Well-portioned serving of pasta. Expensive pricing rhough. One will not get it wrong ordering pizza.
4
Had a nice beef lasagna at the Modesto's in the Elizabeth Hotel (Far East).It cost about 20 bucks and the portion was really large.
3
Always crowded here as its popular and has sidewalk seating. Bit slow to get an order and the pizza was not as great (still good though) as I remember last time. A bit underwhelming.
3
There are many better restaurants in Singapore, you can do better at mant hawker centres and food courts.
They are kid friendly, but the service is slow, and the food is only ok.
4
Just a few minutes walk down from the Hilton and yummy strawberry crepe! Well-presented and good value at $15! My colleaqgue had the pasta and said that was excellent too! Well-priced tasty Italian fare!
4
a very nice italian place with excellent wood fried pizzas and mouth watering pastas.the location is just perfect and will give u a break from all ur shopping up and down the street.very friendly and attentive staff some excellent fresh juices as well..excellent home made ice teaand a super kids friendly place…u cant ask for more for sure
1
When an Italian restaurant has the canned "Parmesan" cheese....you know you're in trouble. Barely passable food and for the price, you can do much better. Wine was watered down too- it was only a bit lighter than my water. Salad was all oil and no taste. Would not recommend
4
This is the Modesto's at Elizabeth Hotel, at Mount Elizabeth Road. We had a salad, a pizza and a pasta. The flavours of the food was good, and the portion were huge. We particularly enjoyed the pasta (the seafood with tomato-based sauce). It was a little spicy but they were very generous with the seafood. Every mouthful we took there was seafood! The pasta was done al dente! Yummilicious! Quite a nice ambience and rather peaceful. Service was prompt and the servers were friendly and helpful. Worth a visit
4
Been at Modesto's for the second visit this time round - and the food was as awesome as ever. Love the service, love the entrée (bread with olive oil and vinegar), as well as their pasta. Also, it's highly commendable that they have this wish-a-pizza charity work going on for the month of April - where half of the earnings from their regular pizza goes to a charity. On top of that, you get to choose 3 toppings to go with the pizza, and there is no limit to the type (premium/normal) of toppings you can choose. So, you can choose all premium toppings if you so desire. What I further appreciate is that they do not shrimp on their toppings, even though this means that they might earn much less from the pizza 'cos of the charity work.So yup... good food, good service, and being socially responsible - will definitely return for more visits
3
Modesto's is a good place to grab a bite if you're not fussy about your Italian food standards. Don't get me wrong, the flavours are average and so is the service. It's enough to fill a gap in your tummy before you go bar hopping around the Orchard area. It's all about location, location, location, at the beginning of one-way Orchard Road.
4
A busy restaurant witha cosy atmosphere and great food. The seafood pasta was a very generous serving of fresh seafood and quality pasta. It is just araound the corner from the Pan Pacific and worth the walk.
4
If you are staying at one of the hotels nearby at Orchard Road, this restaurant is easy to get to, offers very good pizzas, allows you relax and people watch and have a cold beer! Much better than eating at your hotel's restaurant.
3
good child menu. Pizzas okay. Convenient location on Orchard by but not in a mall.
4
Love Aglio Olio and also the pasta dish for two (forgot the nam) with lots of seafood served together in a foil. The Tiramisu is also a good choice. Wished new dishes can be introduced more often.
4
Craving for Italian and visited this restaurant as its just a ten minutes drive from my place. Great location and easily assessible by public transports. Ample parking space within the shopping mall as well. The restaurant has the alfresco sitting or u can choose to sit inside the air conditioned area. Do take note that it may get abit too hot sitting outside with singapore tropical weather.Food wise, I ordered the risotto and my wife ordered the lasagna. The portion was huge and I have trouble stuffing the whole plate of risotto down into my stomach. Generous heaps of fresh seafood on my risotto and the prawns were huge, so were the mussels. Taste wise, above average but when u have too much of something, the taste seems to fade away after a few mouthfuls.Finished the dinner off with the traditional Italian dessert, the tiramisu. Not fantastic and pretty average to me.Plus thing about this restaurant is that it sits just beside the harbour bay and one could enjoy some great sceneries during the meal. The interior of the restaurant reminds me of some Italian home run restaurants in Italy itself...:
4
My second time at the VivoCity outlet after a nice lunch with the family a little over a year ago. Got there rather early for a proper dinner but this gave us the choice in nearly every table present. Eventually chose one with an excellent view of the water and Sentosa Island across.Because we were rather rushed for time, we decided to only choose dishes that the four of us could share. We picked the Fritto Misto (deep-fried seafood appetiser) and Salmone Affumicato (smoked salmon) pizza, both of which were rather nice. Wait staff tried hard to please which was appreciated. A bit pricey overall but you do pay for the view somewhat
2
went with my spouse to this sort-of-italian place for a pizza to have a break from the asian food.Despite having a wood oven the pizza tastes like nothing, the place is loud and stressful.A pint of beer costs outragious 14.50 $ !!!!!!!ItÂ´s ok for families, kids can be loud without getting dirty looks from staff and other guests.The service was not bad, quick and attentive, but the food is less than average
3
You'll get exactly what it says on the box here... decent pizza at a decent price. The branch on Orchard Road has an entertaining view of the activity around Orchard Towers and the one at Vivo City has a nice harbour view.My litmus test is the pizza margherita, and Modesto's is wood-fired, thin and tasty.You're probably on your way somewhere else when you stop in here, and the service is quick, so you can fuel up and get back to shopping
2
Asked for extra tomato and got six thin slices.Asked for extra olives and got four.Regular pizza and wine for two = $50 SingaporeStaff were friendly except did point out "we will charge you for extra"Chain pizza is no better here so we have now resorted to DIY!!
5
We visited Modestos in early November for some good Italian. We were hungry and our waiter recommended the Lingine Alla Modesto. Wow...what a meal!! Just delicious...I had visited this same restaurant back in July and had the pizza...nothing exceptional but it was good...this meal was exceptional. The seafood and marinara souce were just delicious. I heartly recommend spending a little extra to get a glass of the special Chianti they have..it is really good. All in all..good service, a great meal, at a fair price
3
Fresh NZ mussels on fusilli. Good view of the harbour.
4
great desserts, sometimes the appetisers are over cooked, but the service staff are helpful and the food is served promptly.
4
Love the crispy crust and salads
3
usually good, though staff could be better
3
Have always love thin crust wood-fired base pizzas. I like the romantic ambience with panaromic sea view at Vivo City.
4
good pizza lah
5
Their pizza's are thin and baked from the oven on the spot. yum..
3
Only the pizza is nice.. the rest is just average...
5
We were 4 friends who went for sunday lunch.The service was fast and good, ordered some pizzas, pastas, bruchettas and garlic bread. The helpings were good and the food quality was amazing ! Needless to say that we all overate and enjoyed ourselves !The tira-misu dessert was mind blowing and we repeated the order 2 times as we were not able to let go of the "melting taste" in our mouth !Will surely go there when I go to singapore next
2
Bland boring pizzas without sauce or any cheese. Just semi-raw dough and bland veg. I was going to order the seafood pizza until the waiter said it was a frozen seafood mix mainly of crabsticks.The dough wasn't even crispy and was raw in the middle (so were the onions) so I guess the chef either needs to learn to make the wood oven hotter or cook the pizzas longer. Disappointing
4
The pizza is great.. Love the thin crust wood-fired base and not too much tomato sauce... But the experience at Orchard one was disappointing... The staff has too much attitude...
5
Nice view and food is superb though parma ham is not my cup of tea =)
3
love the thin crust pizza.
2
Serve hard Linguine (Tanglin Road). Not really enjoying.
4
Thin crusted pizza...not so "jer lak" not so nauseating....doesn't give you vision problems after one too many.Ha ha
4
Genuine wood-fired pizzas, seafood is fresh, family restaurant ambience with panaromic sea view. Affordable prices, check out current credit card promotions for best deal. Recommended for casual dining.
4
the pizzas are huge, tasty, authentic and reasonably priced. The staff there is friendly and attentive.
5
aaaahhhh... the best pizzas in town! this outlet has the best location too! great for a romantic date.
3
the quad-core, erm, i mean, quad-cheese pizza is quite nice, as well as the pine-nut pasta
4
love the pizzas!!!
