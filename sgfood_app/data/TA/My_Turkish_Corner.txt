I had a very filling lunch. For $10, I picked up a kebab with lots of salad and a wonderful sauce. You get the usual choice of chicken, beef or lamb.

It was one day of heavy storm!I was delighted to find a shelter at the muslim area.
Clean restaurant with Turkish food and friendly staff made me feel very lucky at that moment.

if i say worse, its worst.. not even a better word to describe.. salty, dry, bland, soggy, tasteless.... what more can you ask for.

The kebab is not really big and not really tasty. French fried not include.
The falafel was good!
You can find better (I hope)

Finally found a good kebab around Arab street. The price is affordable. The food is good with many choice.

One of the rare occasions to have to quiet dinner. At my hotel on enquiry I was suggested to try out this resturant. Silently moved towards my table when a warm hand was extended greetings exchanged then from there on I found suggestions and reccomendations to try out the variety of bread and kebabs all I was satisfied being alone was a quiet drink and a few recommended varieties of chicken and meat with the hot crispy bread, after a long time relished a dinner alone with the heaped courtesy and fine attention extended. A fine place to visit with the family to have a lovely dinner,ideal for those romantic young ones who can eat and yet have the joy of being together

Now called House of Kebab!Wandered into Arab Street looking for a quick lunch and happened upon this humble but wonderful establishment. I ordered hummus, pita and falafel... Wow was I surprised with such nice fresh ingredients and service with a smile. Prices can't be beat: e.g., falafel wrap was 6.50 Sing (or about $5 USD) and was quite massive in weight. They also offer things for the carnivores as well. Order your food and enjoy it while watching life go by on the avenue perched at one of their shaded tables out front. They also take cc's. I'll be back

My wife and I had the pleasure of having some time in Singapore and went for a stroll. It was about lunchtime and sure enough the scents of excellent food attracted us to this corner restaurant. It is in little India district, on Arab street. The welcoming was excellent. inviting not pushy, and the food was excellent. In the hot steamy weather, it was raining outside, we had bottled water with our dishes. the food was exquisite

On a recent visit to Singapore , and Arab street in particular, we ate lunch at a rip off restaurant called Corner Turkish restaurant. The food was good, I got felafels and a spicy dip called Esme, but the prices were outrageous. Our friend Pat bought a coffee and a piece of Baklava, which was the size of a quarter, and cost $8! I would not recommend this restaurant based on the small portions and high costs. Avoid at all costs
