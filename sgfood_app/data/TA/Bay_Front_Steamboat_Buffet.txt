The place has variety of food options available.
The Pricing is little on higher end but worth the pay for good cousin.

For the price you pay, it is cheap, but don't expect quality stuff. BYO if you can to make it up. Non air con but I like best the sea breeze.

Visited this place 2 weeks ago with Family, after walking 2 round and decided to try the BBQ steamboat, soup base available; chicken soup, herbal, tomyam and laksa. we tried chicken and laksa soup. All I can say is wide variety of seafood like big Crab, crayfish lobster, prawn, bamboo clam, sea cucumber and etc, and so as marinated meats for BBQ and veggies as well, free flow soft drinks and ice cream. The friendly Boss there surprise me with live big scallop...live big scallop normally available on Friday night (info from boss). Do visit their fb for more details www.facebook.com/marinabaysteamboa

Went with a group of colleagues for dinner here on a Friday. Variety of food is average, however the fried rice and fried items are cold; they were not kept in a heated warmer or similar. As huge fans are installed on the ceiling, plus the windy condition, the flames of our stove was not heating evenly and thus, one side of the hot plate took a longer time to cook. Overall, a great place to gather with friends and family
