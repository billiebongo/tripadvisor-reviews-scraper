This recently opened restaurant is in a strip that features several restaurants that have been around for ages such as Pasta Fresca and Casa Roma. It's lovely to see a new Japanese restaurant open in the locality and it has proved to be a very pleasant surpriseThis restaurant specialises in yakitori, sukiyaki and shabu-shabu. My family and I went for the yakitori and found everything to be excellent. Well seasoned and extremely well prepared as was the ebi tempura that we ordered. Good service. Not too difficult to get a parking space right outside Hibiki and quite reassuring to see Japanese patrons. Looking forward to my next visit
