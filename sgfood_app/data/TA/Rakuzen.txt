Sitting here now, just finished chicken noodle curry and crab sushi. Only visited because it's opposite the hotel door. Pleasantly surprised would recommend for a casual meal. Busy with locals.
3
Had Wagyu Tataki and Miso soup. The Wagyu was good - a bit too fatty. The restaurant is not really appealing from the perspective of interior design.
So - mid level.
4
Went to the place couple of time as it was just across the road from the hotel. The food was ok, sushi choices very acceptable, nothing exciting. Convenient location, good food, reasonable service, suitable for business dinner.

I would recommend this place when you crave for Japanese Food. The price is right. Our orders arrived quick. Gyoza is really my favorite but Gyoza here is quite disappointing. I will still rate this 5 star cause the beef was really tender and tasty. The rest of the food was excellent. They serve fresh seafoods. My friend ordered additional sushi and sashimi just for him.

we liked the nice and friendly feel of this restaurant from the moment we saw it. an outside table was found for us despite being almost full. the menu was unmistakably Japanese with some very helpful well produced photos. the food was authentic and the service was excellent. highly recommended
4
Staffs kind of don’t understand what customer’s order... Nothing special in terms of the menu! Need to check the bell battery cuz couldn’t call staffs to order foods!We came here right on the day that there was only one cook, everything was so slow on that day!

Had a dinner at this fantastic place. The ambience is very nice. The service was very efficient. We sat at the sushi counter wherein 2 chefs were preparing fresh dishes. We ordered Nigiri Sushi. Sashimi platter. The fish was fresh and tasted yummy. The best wish was Stamina Roll. The eel was very well cooked it just melted in the mouth. The sashimi salad was also very fresh an delicious. With 2 of us dining, the bill was $115. Overall a wonderful experience.

was here for lunch today with friends. surprisingly it was not as crowded as expected at lunch time. we had a room for 4 of us.. pretty neat. service was fast, the menu extensive. meal was served rather quickly and when we needed to call for the server, we just had to press the buzzer. we had the sakura chirashidon zen, the sushi was really fresh. it was thoroughly worth the 15 mins drive here
5
Went here for family dinner and sat at the sushi counter; ordered from the chef directly and was blown away! Sushi nigiri using such fresh cuts of fish, small mounds of rice so soft and delicate - absolute winner! Sashimi Salad that totally rocked - huge serving full of sashimi pieces! One of our fav sushi experiences to date! The sushi chefs all so knowledgable and friendly; knew their stuff! The source only the best produce from near and far. To top off a great meal they even threw in some icecream desert for kids on the house!!... total winner!!

I had been to Rakuzen about 2 years ago and had an amazing meal - quality food and attentive staff. Sadly, upon my second visit much has changed. To start with the service is all but gone. Told that there were no tables available apart from at the sushi bench I was amazed to see table available with others being shown but clearly they did not want two people siting at a four seater table. I get that but when a place is not full it is rather silly. After 15 minutes our order was taken and 40 minutes later we were told that our meal was still 15-20 minutes - the place was not even full!!! When one meal arrived it was cold and it was meant to have been part of the wider meal so we simply got up and left. There are so many other places in the area to eat that I would skip Rakuzen.

Service was very good and friendly. Nothing special about the food which was standard Japanese restaurant offering but was of good quality and well presented.
4
It's a small Japanese restaurant but with decent food. Especially the combo plates are an excellent choice with good sushi, sashimi and other stuff. Good value for money with OK service...
4
Sushi, beef, sashimi, tempura veg., sake all of it was very tasty and definitely above average. Kind service , will come back.

I have been to Rakuwen in KL several times, this was not as good. The food was ok, menu lacked choice i.e. very few sets. The food was ok but served very quick so assume premade. Overall ok but probably will not go back.
1
I have been to the restaurant a few times out of convenience. Food quality and service is average but the served food is very similar to what I see in the menu. It didn't occurred to me that they have a disclaimer, well hidden beneath the busy design, at bottom of menu that states "all photos shown are for representations only". Hence, I was shocked and greatly disappointed when the 'sakura chirashidon zen' served to me have very little resemblance to the picture shown in the menu!!☹️staff replied the selection for the dish is up to the chef!! so, this is one restaurant where 'what you see and think you are paying for, is likely not what you get'
3
We were regular diners at the KL outlets necause they were fantastic (especially Sunway Putra) and now we moved to SG we wanted to see if it was as good. Well.... it wasnt as good as Kuala Lumpur's. They dont stock the signature salad dressing, service is a bit vague, the menu is lacking a lot of the selection and generally speaking it was just a dull meal. What a shame they couldn't replicate the great experience here in Singapore.

6 of us had dinner here and nobody enjoyed the food, 3 of us didn't even eat what we were served. Were asked if we wanted frozen or fresh sushi; the seared beef was raw and basically consisted of the waitress applying a blowtorch to some beef slices at the table, unfortunately not cooking all of it, no seasoning, tasteless chewy meat. Sushi rolls had grit in them. Parts of our order never came. The person who ate most of the meal was ill later. Worst food I've ever seen in a restaurant, all 5 colleagues agreed, and we've eaten together in many places around the world

My family visited Rakuzen for lunch on 24 June 2016. We were ushered into a booth seat which is located on the left side of the restaurant once you enter through the main door. It is a great seating choice for some privacy and comfort, considering the right side of the restaurant consisted of tables in an open space.My children ordered the ramen which looked really good. My husband and I ordered the beef teppanyaki set and it was very disappointing. We had requested for the beef to be medium cooked as the waitress said that medium well would be hard, so she recommended medium cooked. We followed her advice, but when the food came, the beef was so tough, it was as good as almost well done. I didn't finish the beef in the end, had to leave half the amount behind as I have difficulty eating hard and chewy food.The California roll was served, topped with a dollop of mayonnaise on top of each roll. I never had eaten it that way before, typically dipping it in shoyu sauce. May I suggest that the chef place the mayonnaise on the side of the dish so that the customers have a choice of eating it or not? I had to scrape it off.Otherwise, a pretty normal lunch, nothing overwhelmingly good to draw me back to the restaurant anytime soon

Located at Marina Square /Suntec City vicinity. Opposite Conrad Hotel Singapore. Nearest MRT station is Esplanade station, take Suntec City Exit.Nice cosy restaurant with friendly waiters and waitresses. Need not wait very long for food to be served. Reservation for Friday evening recommended.Tasty food at affordable prices. Everyday 12 noon - 2pm, they serve set lunch which will be more value for money (about 20% saving). At least 10 choices in their set lunch menu.Rakuzen (Tampines Branch) already ceased operation. Taken by a Halal Western Food Restaurant operated by a charitable organisation

The location I visited is on Telok Ayer, but that one isn't in Trip Advisor and it is the same restaurant group. I enjoyed my meal here. The restaurant is fairly small, but there is counter seating for at least 10 people. So I ate there, with lots of help ordering from the attentive wait staff. I ate eel for a main dish and some kind of fish for an appetizer (kawahagi). First time having both and it was quite taste for my American palate. Teriyaki sauce on the eel made it taste. The dish came with rice, and also a cup of miso soup. Nice place if you are looking for Japanese food. Seems like a place for regulars and visitors alike.
4
They have private room hence I think it is good option for business lunch. Quality of food is good. You will never disappoint your partner
3
The Marina area now has even more Japanese dining options than ever. Rakuzen has been there awhile and doesn't seem to have maintained its edge.
4
Set lunch goes as low as $14 with tax when you sit outside.. the food is really good... as for the sit outside menu when u are there for weekday lunch.. ☺
5
I just ate at Rakuzen this week, all the seafood and salads are so fresh and yummy.
Especially the sashimi mori its to die for, you must try lah.
5
Good grades of sashimi
BriLlant presentation of food
great sakes choices
Good for family gatherings, big groups or friends of 6 .
5
It was my first time to dine in at this restaurant and I had a good experience! Their foods are great especially the sashimi which are fresh and at reasonable price!
5
Sashimi is fresh.
Pocket friendly.
Too many options to choose until don't know what to eat.
Nice ambience, and I like they come with complimentary free flow of green tea, both hot n cold.

We arrived 1 hour before closing and ordered Udon and Teriyaki Beef. I was surprised that they ran out of Udon broth for the Udon - so we opted for miso soup because the whole point of coming here was my girlfriend wanted to have udon. Such a disappointment. The udon ended up not being very good. My beef teriyaki was also a disappointment - the beef was quite chewy some pieces were like rubber that after chewing I had to spit it out. Definitely not the quality I was expecting. It was a big disappointment to a good day in Singapore
4
I had lunch and dinner here a dozen times with friends and business associates, and although the sushi may not be the freshest around, Rakuzen never fail to maintain a certain reasonable standard. The staff are always very friendly and all in all the ambience and whole package is spot on. You get what you pay for
5
The restaurant offers many options. But its specialty is the sashimi, which are flown fresh directly from Japan twice weekly. The uni and the amaebi is especially sweet. And the otoro price is unbeatable. U cant get the same quality cheaper anywhere else.Karei age or a type of fried flatfish is a hit with my family. Its meat are cut out and shaped into balls, so no worries about bones. The whole fish bone is then deep-fried to a crisp, perfect with beer.The restaurant does not offer any kid menus, but u can request for mini udon or ramen. My 18mo baby finished up the whole bowl of udon by himself, which was a surprise since he usually doesn't eat much.Highly recommended, even for families too

Good foods
Good alcohol
Good chefs
Good service!!!
The tourists going to Singapore must try this restaurant. It's near by many five stars hotel.
5
A good Japanese restaurant with a good vegetarian option. The set vegetarian meal offers a great selection. Price is a bit high but well worth it.
5
quality of food, but service a little slow. The lunch bento box selection is quite good and the layout of the restaurant allows you to choose to sit outside or inside.
2
We ate here because close to Conrad Hilton and looked authentic. The waitresses were half asleep and got our orders wrong. Food was OK but experience brought it down. Wouldn't recommend so many other great places nearby.
2
This is affordable (read: low quality ) Japanese food, and to a certain extent, poor service . There are some dinner sets available and we chose thoseMine was a sushi and udon set. The sushi pieces are tiny and the fish of the pedestrian varietyThere were 5 of us and 2 of my friends were served their chicken dish only after 3 of us finished eating . But at least the chicken was somewhat freshly grilled
4
Very good Japanese food in Singapore at a relatively affordable price. I really like the fact that Rakuzen is one of the few Japanese restaurants in Singapore that offers whole grain rice as an option. Their Unagi is very good. My favorite dish, hoever, may be the Ikura Chawan-mushi - egg custard with salmon roe - delicious
4
Was trying to have some 'Me' time for lunch today. Decided to head to Rakuzen at Millenia. Love the quietness and serene surrounding. I've ordered 5-kinds of sashimi. Requested to change the prawns and squids to something else as I do not fancy raw prawns. The staff made the change but explained that I have to top up $3 extra and I said ok. Turns out to be great that they changed to fresh scallop for me. Love the sashimi. It's freshness and sweetness tasted like its directly air flown from Japan. Would have love to order a Sapporo beer to go along but as I need to head back to work, I've settled for a hot green tea instead. Service is good and prompt. Would certainly go back for more
4
It is such a pity that the waitresses are completely disinterested in seating or serving you, because when you perservere the end results are great.The stand out dish for me was the scallop sashimi, as well as the more main stream tuna sashimi. I wasn't personally convinced by the fatty salmon, which was just personal taste rather than a reflection on the quality of the dish itself. All of the sushi and sashimi that we received was wonderful, beautifully presented and obviously really good quality.We followed up with some of the hot dishes, which are also very good in particular the thin slices of beef with crispy caramalised onions. However, the waitress failed to remember our order correctly for the hot food so we did end up with some swaps for dishes that we hadn't ordered! Luckily we aren't a picky bunch and ate them instead of trying to negotiate with the waitress for the food that we had actually ordered, as I suspect this would've been a slightly painful process
2
The food came at completely different times, so one guest got all his right away but had to wait for the others food to arrive 20 min later.All three guests ordered separately, but we all had one maki bite in common, the Dragon Roll. Two of the rolls look great, but the meat in the third was brown and disgusting. We asked to have it changes. Another 20 min went buy and we asked what happened. The manager then replies that the chef is too busy, but we won't be charger for the bad one. HELLO.100 dollars for 5 maki rolls????Unbelievably poor service, and highly average food
4
We visited on a weekday evening at my husbands suggestion as he'd been before and enjoyed it. We sat outside on a lovely balmy evening and had a selection of sashimi followed by some grilled dishes. All were delicious, the only drawback being the waiting staff who were slow in bringing drinks and taking orders. They were busy and looked a little understaffed, this shuoldn't put you off though as the food is worth the wait.Reservations weren't needed
4
Excellent freshness of sashimi at reasonable price. I recommend this restaurant for family as the broad choice of the menu could adjust any taste. My child doesn't eat raw fish but found lots of alternatives dishes. Well done Rakuzen!
5
We visited the Rakuzen by the hint of a true singaporian& cant say we complained
Such a warm welcome
Great fresh (really fesh) fish & original sushi - sashimi & other traditional Japanese food
Thx to the manager for the wine advice

Some of the best sushi in a great location to dine indoors or out is Rakuzen. Located near the Millenium Mall, Rakuzen has fast, friendly service and really fine sushi. I’ve been there a number of times and never been disappointed.
4
Each time we're in Singapore we make a beeline for Rakuzen. Staying at the Conrad (next door) certainly makes it convenient.The service is efficient and friendly.The food is great value for money, the Rakuzen specials and side dishes are all great value, especially compared to Australian Japanese restaurants.We've had many lunches and dinners and have yet to be disappointed by even a dish!In the Singapore heat the beers on tap are a winner

Visited this location almost 2 years ago and found it great so decided to return. Shockingly, the new menu was so alike Sushi Tei that i could find 80% similarity of items.Once again i decided to try the Saikoro Steak Yasai Itame (Diced beef steak with pan fried vegetables). To my disappointment, the beef cubes were overcooked and the vegetables did not feel fresh and light that would complemented the beef. Instead, it was laden with cabbage and oily. We also ordered the kanimayo maki which was okay and tempura where we definitely had better elsewhere.Thankfully service was better than normal.All in all, just a convenient dinner place but definitely not one to go out of your way for
3
Decent sushi at reasonable prices. This place is definitely good value. But the service staff needs more training. After being seated for quite some time, no one approached our table. And it was quite difficult to flag someone down to take our order. I ordered a bottle of wine, but it never came. I had to flag another server down to remind them. Only after reminding them did the wine arrive, but it was the wrong bottle! Yes, it was a busy night -- the evening before a public holiday -- but that's no excuse for poor service. If it's too busy, then either hire more staff or decrease the number of open tables so that patrons can get proper attention and service
4
I have been here a number of times and the food is always very good and consistant always very fresh and the staff are always very helpful, and they have a very good Saki range as well. The Sashimi was of the highest quality and as one would expect very fresh, an dthe rolls are superb, I was a little disappointed with the tempura but I generally wouldn't order it anywhere but in a Tempura restaurant so I should follow my own advise. I recommend this place highly
5
Went here twice in two days after a recommendation from a friend. This multinational chain has a very extensive menu of Japanese food, from yakitori to sushi to tempura to katsu etc. I tried the torched fatty belly fish selection and the fatty tuna/fatty swordfish/fatty salmon plates, and they were among the best I have eaten anywhere in the world, including Tokyo. Prices are in line with the quality, reasonably affordable for what you get. Finished with the yuzu sherbet, which was wonderful
4
In the Marina Bay area of Singapore we were looking for a decent meal. A tip from a contact at our hotel pointed us in the direction of Rakuzen. Arrived there the place was full up, which is always a good sign. We were asked if we minded to sit outside, which normally in Singapore humidity is not advisable but a cool breeze persuaded us so we did just that.The list of dishes included Kimchi (obviously not standard Japanese) which was very much appreciated, bought in we learned but nevertheless very good.We also had a small sashimi (called Hama I think) which was very much ok.Beef Tataki, a favorite of ours from other restaurants, we ordered and liked very very much.Then came the grilled eel, again delicious with a soba salad.We did find the waiter doing his job very, a bit too much, thoroughly by continuously pushing his specials but all in all, very good service.At a price of 110 S$ not cheap but good value we found.So actually Rakuzen gets a very good for the wonderful flavors that kept following each other

Rakuzen is conveniently located in the mall opposite the Conrad Hotel. We sat outside - not much of a view other than the street but very pleasant nonetheless. The menu offers an extensive range of sushi and sashimi, and also has a picture of each item - ideal for us amateurs!The serving staff were very helpful in explaining the different cuts of fish and the sushi and sashimi that we chose were excellent - fresh and nicely prepared. All too often I find that good sushi and sashimi comes with an outrageous price tag, but that certainly wasn't the case here. Indeed, I thought the bill was very reasonable for the selection we had.If you're in the area I'd certainly recommend trying it
