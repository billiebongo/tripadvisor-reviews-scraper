Fining dinning concept. Very expensive though but the set dinner is just nice to fill the stomach. Not too much!
5
Excellent pasta alongn boat quay.
You can sit near the river and enjoy different pasta. Will definitely come back!
4
Pasta and pizza were good, authentic and flavourful. Rich and awesome taste. Highly recommended for lunch
5
The food was authentic and great! One of the best pastas in Singapore! But the price is slightly on the high side.
5
Tasty food & reasonable price. Very nice sitting outside overviewing Singapore river. So close to MRT, will surely come back.

Had a very good pizza night at the Boat Quay walking.
Very fresh and good topping with tasty mozzarella and Parma ham too.

I love the ambience at Boat Quay and at this restaurant I especially enjoy san giovanrese pasta. Sitting on the river's edge sipping wine, watching the ferries go by, the lights of the colonial parts of Singapore come on at dusk. I have been to this restuarant of the past 18 months and the quality is consistent
4
Overall, the food was good. Ambience was good. The Chef (or maybe was the owner), came over to speak to us briefly, probably wanted to make sure that we finished our food. Haha. Had the house wine and it was good as well. Experience has been great but next time, will try the pasta.

It has been a while since I last wrote a TripAdvisor review, but I am making a comeback, because it has been a while since I've had a meal so bad that I felt like I needed to warn others about it. The location is smack in the tourist trap of Boat Quay. Plenty of bars in the area, which is nice, but the restaurants perhaps aren't great. However, my friend and I were craving for some pasta and we were just two shop lots down from Pasta Fresca. We had a look at the menu, and everything sounded and looked good.We ordered a bottle of their $100 wine (Brunello Di Montacilno), because we thought we'd like to pair a good wine with some good food. My friend ask what vintage the wine was and the waiter replied "it is full bodied". I guess that was an indicator, but nevertheless, its a restaurant at Boat Quay, I didn't want to set my expectations so high. We ordered the meat and cheese platter, and I asked "What meats and cheese come in it?" Waiters response: "pork, beef, parmesan, and some other cheeses too, like blue cheese". I was looking for a little more detailed information than just pork and beef, but OK. Strike two.Upon eating what tasted like store bought meats and cheeses (I'm fairly certain it was store bought, not even from a butcher) we decided on the white wine Vongole soup. We received a bowl of what tasted like clams in simmered water. No taste. ZERO. No seasoning, tasteless, HORRIBLE. We sent the order back, as I wasn't going to pay for a bowl of clams and hot water. We then decide to have pasta, skipping our three course plan because of the disappointing clams. We ordered the Crabmeat pasta (with linguine) and the, what seemed like their speciality as it was in its own separate pull out, the burrata ravioli with truffles. Crabmeat not fresh based on taste and smell. Portion of crab was poor. the linguini however was perfectly al dente. Props to the chef for that, at least he knows how to cook his pasta al dente. The ravioli (the supposed "star") was horrible. I don't know why this dish has been highlighted on their menu, but it was very plain. This could have been tucked in to the regular menu, because it didn't 'wow' me at all. It just tasted like plain cheese ravioli with a mushroom sauce. I don't think the ravioli was fresh, it didn't taste like it, unlike the linguini, where it seemed fresh.The end of the evening, the waiter hovered back and forth with the check book, because they needed to close, which we completely understood, so I called him over and asked for the check which he had ready in his underarms. We paid for the $200 bill (minus the Vongole soup, he removed it, rightly so). The waiter then brought out two plastic cups, which I told him to take back because I was not about to pour the $100 wine in a plastic cup (Oh, $100 was a bit steep, but my friend highly recommended it and it was good wine, although apparently you can get it cheeper elsewhere). The only highlight from the evening was the wine and the store bought meat and cheese plate. Which I guess we could have done at home. Clams were a HUGE letdown. Pasta was cooked well, but didn't 'wow' us at all. I am not sure if the chef is Italian (I don't think so). If he is, he needs to return home and take a vacation with nonna. I don't mean to insult the chef and his cooking, but this was a very VERY bad meal. And no, I will not return... Never again..

It was raining so the terrace seats along the river was wet, when we asked if they can wipe the seats, they used a wet cloth instead of a dry one, which was puzzling... While we were only 2 people sitting at a table for 4, they only wiped half of the seats so the seat next to me was still wet. We ordered pesto, and a tomato-based pasta with salmon meat. The pasta was overcooked. They also served pasta with the parmesan cheese powder that u can find at saizeriya, which I don't think should be allowed at a proper italian restaurant. Maybe I had the wrong expectations at prices that we're paying. The night view was nice though
5
Simple food done well. Service was attentive and there were no complaints on the food quality or taste. There are a number of restaurants down here at cuppage plaza, this one is worth a visit.
4
decent fresh pasta. breaded chicken was really average, but the other dishes were ok for the price point. will probably visit again.
5
Always good food on Boat Quay. Enjoy lunch or dinner by the river. Delicious food. Service misses Nicola.
5
We wanted a nice resurant with a fantastic view. My husband found the restaurant on Facebook. We were pleasantly surprised, and would recommend the pizza.
5
Brought my regional head and head of department over for lunch. They love it! Great service paired with superb food. TWO THUMBS UP!
4
There was alot of pasta choises from the menu..Food was nice..the ambiance was nice and very relexing
5
Tasty good value Italian restaurant on Boat Quay. A lovely spot on the river to relax or people watch.
2
Lovely location. We met friends here who were visiting Singapore at the same time. Unfortunately the server we had, better referred to as a order taker, was totally useless. A tall slim young fellow who could learn a bit of personal skills. No introduction, no offering of drinks, no asking if we needed to order, cleared the table, never came back to ask if we needed anything else. We finished our meals and left to have coffee elsewhere. Not a memorable visit. I would rate the food decent, but because the experience was so bad, the rating is poor.
3
Pasta Fresca has always been our favourite place for pizza / risotto night. Can never find risotto as hearty and tasty as this place n the pizza used to be one of the best in town. But not on that Tuesday evening, we had antipasti misto followed by pizza Diavola with pork salami, and two types of risotto. Something not usual with the pizza: the dough, the taste was different, I don't know. Somehow we felt like we weren't at Pasta Fresca. Hope it was an ad hoc chef that night, or wrong recipe, or oven that's not working right. We hope to find back our favourite pizza again next time
4
We spent five days in Singapore during F1 and ate twice at this restaurant. Very good pizza and pasta. There were a lot of people at this time, but the service was on top. If you are going to eat Italian food with a nice view, I really recommend this place. At very good prices to be Singapore
4
Restaurant has a nice location on Boat Quay, near to Financial District. Business and leisure hand in hand. Food is excellent, pizza molto buona, draft beer perfect - mama mia!
5
REALLY LOVED THIS PLACE. perfect setting, perfect company, perfect food and lovely service. What more can one ask for!
5
Its great that the staff accept my request of the table sitting and appreciate that they reserve it even we were late.
4
I like Italian meals and I know how it should be. There are good cuisine. May be it's not excellent but really good. A big selection of pasta. I recommend pizza.
5
A firm favourite in buzzing Boat Quay. A varied menu with plenty of veggie options included. Good food, great location.
4
It is boat quay, so be prepared. However, we actually had a quite nice dinner here. Pizzas were even good.
5
We had pizza and carbonara. Pizza was ok and carbonara was amazing. The staff was friendly and polite. Prices as usuall in Singapore (quite expensive).
1
Pizza was soggy in the middle, crust not crunchy nor soft, impossible to cut. Probably one of the worst i have had. Gnocchi was super dense, in a tomato sauce that doesn't have any other taste than purely sour... such a far cry from what it was couple of years ago
1
I'm not even going to bother with a long review. The food might sound Italian on the menu but that's as close as it gets. An 'Italian' restaurant that serves a caprese salad with lettuce instead of basil? Main course was dry chewy salmon served with 3 tiny lumps of bland boiled potato and overcooked broccoli .Then we get to the service. Clearly the location guarantees enough passing trade from tourists that they don't have to make any effort whatsoever because I can't imagine anyone would make that mistake twice. After waiting 10 minutes I had to walk across the road to the restaurant from the quayside to ask for a glass of water This place is just AWFUL, keep walking..
4
After many years of absence, I went back to this restaurant for lunch. They had a set menu (Monday-Friday) that came with soup, bread, mains - pasta or pizza and coffee; so I decided on that because it was good value and saved the hassle of choosing. The food was pretty good and the service was satisfactory. The location and ambience were better than average. Alas, at the end, the waitress had to spoil everything - when bringing back my change during cash payment, she dropped some coins. This was not a problem. The problem was her attitude - she refused to pick up the coins and took for granted I should just accept this. I felt it was very unprofessional and unacceptable of her. If I had said, Oh forget about it, then things would be different. She was nonchalant and trivial about it, like it's just a few coins what's the big deal? Like I said, unprofessional
5
Super location on Boat Quay , dining tables next to the river. Good Italian food and wine.There are AC tables but the pleasure is outside.
4
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore is located on a picturesque spot on popular Boat Quay, with fantastic views of the City and colourful shophouses. The menu is wide, the food is tasty, and the views the best in Singapore.
5
Hearty Italian restaurant with superb views of Singapore's CBD. Located on fun Boat Quay, popular for city workers and tourists alike, this little Italian is hard to beat for it's delicious menu at not too expensive prices
5
Yes, I didn't order pasta. But no worries other dishes are as good as any of the fresh pasta. Definitely will be back again. Love the place.
4
Pasta was really good.
We had a ravioli with a mushroom/truffle cream sauce and a crab/tomato based sauce with spaghetti.
Our food came out very quickly, which we liked,cause we were super hungry.
Great setting right on the river.
Would definitely recommend.
5
We come here all the time for their prossecuto e fungi calzones that are the best in Singapore. The best part is that they can make any of the 20+ pizzas on their menu in a calzone, most Italian restaurants will only do a few calzone options.It's a nice place to relax over dinner and wine - especially if you get one of the coveted tables that are next to the river. The service is consistently good and we often see Mr Salvatore as part of the crew
3
Wifi is very poor and not worth usingFood very average. They do a great offer of freeflow and food Friday 6-9 for SGD 43Riverside, veranda and inside air con seating down stairs. Large upstairs with views.Popular but food very very average and over salt
3
I read the positive reviews online before I decided to come here with my husband for dinner. We thought it would be a nice romantic setting to dine by the quay. So our appetizer came, we ordered the eggplant parmigiana (our go-to at most italian restaurants), and we were pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was! We gobbled it down, along with our refreshing rocket salad. We thought the next dishes were going to be even better, judging from our appetizers.However, we were sorely disappointed. My husband ordered the 'chef recommended' Polpa di Granchio, crabmeat sauteed in garlic and tomato sauce, whilst I had the smoked salmon pasta. He said his dish was a bit salty, and portion was small for him. While my dish tasted just average...there was nothing special about it, although the portion was fine for me. Presentation for both dishes were non-existent. We also had the house white wines...that was a mistake. It tasted horrible! I couldn't finish mine and my husband had to chug his...Not sure if I'll come back to try the other dishes...but at least I know the eggplant parm was good
5
We had a very relaxed lunch sat outside, under canvas, by on the Quay watching the fish swim along the edge. A nice change from the eastern style food typical of Singapore. Very much an Italian. The pizza was excellent and hubby said the lasagne was lovely too. The house red was very tasty and to be recommended. The staff were very polite and helpful
3
Been to Pasta Fresca years ago but a first to the one at Boat Quay. Went with family thus had the joy of having a variety to dig into. Can't complain on venue as its really a great location...For starters had the Tagliere Misto,Calamari Fritti and Bruschetta .Tasty and good selection of cheese for the mixed platter. Won't say it was authentic Italian style starters but appetising enough.Main had lasagne, crespelle all fungi and diavola and marinara pizzas. Can't go wrong with the pizzas. Lasagne was not great as it was dry and lacked taste. Maybe wasn't cooked well. Would like it done better next time round.. Crespelle was ok. Desert. As they say the proof is in the pudding.Ordered Tiramisu and top it of with Macchiatto.Good portion for atleast 3 to share. Taste wise would say OK. Macchiatto was a let down. If you like it bitter then maybe might be your kinds taste. The service was exceptional. Great work ! Overall great place to bring family friends and have a good day out over lunch or dinner. With food that wont make you go wild but will please your appetite.If there was a rating that said Good. Would rate it as Good . Better than average but won't say Very Good. 
5
Great Food with nice atmosphere around 👌👌👌👌 will surely come back again and try out other pasta dishes
5
Ate here twice, the food and service were excellent. Authentic Italian cuisine at a reasonable price.
4
The pasta and the rice did not taste nice. The place was cozy and the ambient was nice. The staff were friendly.
5
6 of us visited this restaurant for my birthday dinner. We've ordered 5 different types of pasta and all I can say is yummy! I enjoyed every single flavour and we will definitely come back again! Service was good too.
3
Nice view of the water. Bread was not served with dinner-had to ask special. It was very dry and unappealing. Small portions of pasta-but good flavor. We were done in 1/2 hour. Would not return.
4
Went for dinner with my partner and we got a first row table next to the river. The food that we order was amazing, Ravioli Verdi Al Funghi e Asparagi for me and Spaghetti Alla Carbonara (which I tasted) for her. Both dishes were very tasty and on a medium/big portions. The service was good and the food was delivered to the table without making us wait for it, simply on the right moment.The home-made Tiramisu that I had for dessert wasn't the best but still good. I recommend this place and will plan to come back again on a future visit to Singapore
5
Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore is a reliable restaurant for tasty, authentic and reasonably priced Italian cusine. Founded by Chef Salvatore decades ago, with impeccable service by Nicola, this is a regular haunt for me. I love the riverside dining at Boat Quay, with some of the best views of Singapore. Great for couples, singles, business. It was great to go on St Valentine's Day and not to be ripped off by expensive set menus - all credit to Chef Salvatore
2
Boat quay delivers nice views, but the good things stop there. The food was average.The rocket salad was dry and the lasagna flavorless. The red house wine was undrinkable.The tables and the seats were like a self service restaurant. No tablecloths, no placemats, nothing at all.The staff was smiling but the whole atmosphere gave you the impression of a rushed, cheap service.Touristy like the whole area and way overpriced
1
we had bruchetta and lasagna. the bruchetta without tomato and average taste. lemon juice tasted discusting. and the lasagna was... I don't know how old. but definitely freezed and I almost puked. it was just a mash without structure... the waiter was unfriendly and harsh. all in all a really nice dinner, you can't go wrong with that
5
The host was very friendly and a real Italian. We felt ourselves somewhere in the region of Tuscany. The waiters did need some control of the host. The wine was perfect and the food was great. We had small appetizers and a nice main course. We will be bac
5
I had the occasion to visit this place in 1996 and i remember that the food was excellent. I revisited the place 20 Years after my first visit and i can say that the food is still gut but the design is more up class.
5
Didnt expect the food to be that good and the wine was genuinely Italian and quality.well recommended
5
Nice location directly at the singapore river. It is newly renovated. Food (we had pizza, pasta and salad) was great. Service was extraordinary good. We felt good and for sure we are coming back.
5
Visited here last sat after a hectic day..very comfortable sitting by the side of river..staff is quick and humble..Being vegetarian we ordered garlic bread as starter which was just ok..main course was nice..with a plenty of option of pastas with different sauces and pizza too had 2-3 veggie options.Portion size is good for two people if u order one pizza and one pasta..had 5 beers and end with ice cream..the bill was $138 which was quite ok seeing the place and the location.visit here for some nice occasion to celebrate or relax
2
As the rest of boat quay restaurants, overpriced and much below expectations. I went for garlic bread and fettuccine arrabbiata, garlic bread below average quality, pasta was harmfully and annoyingly spicy. Both are overpriced for such low quality. Normally I don't judge future visits based on first one, but this restaurant is definitely a no go.
4
Located along East Coast road for many years the place is spacious with outdoor settings.Choices of pasta of seafood, crabmeat, smoked salmon softshell crab with a list of pasta and sauce of your choice.Pizza with assortment of taste and you can order half of seafood, mozzarella, pork ham with olives.Dark Erdinger is our delight to complement our al dente sphagetti and thinly baked pizza.Lots of tirimisu cakes and ice cream to end your wonderful satisfying Italian meal.The bill amounted to over S$185 for 7 pax
5
Each time at Pasta Fresca has filled with exceptional service and superb food. The hand made pasta and quality are truly felt in every bite. I truly appreciate the value prices of not just the food but the wine as well. Italian food must definitely be enjoyed with a bottle of nice wine. The staff at Pasta Fresca are attentive and quick to offer brilliant recommendations. Small touches such as the free valet service is also a plus! I also loved to see the passion of service seen by the behavior of the owner as he chatted with every customer at the restaurant! Truly Legendary! A must go, I am sure you will be a fan after your experience there
5
I'm beyond impressed with the level of detail and service demonstrated by the staff at this restaurant. Despite having only a few hours to prepare, the staff were very accommodating and was able to make arrangements for my proposal, which made it a huge success. The restaurant was beautiful with an amazing night view of the Singapore river, and the food was incredibly good with so many varieties of pasta and sauces! A huge thanks to restaurant manager Van who helped to make everything go so smoothly. Thanks Van! Definitely coming back for more :
3
if you go for good location - yes this is great at the river.if you go for service - maybe not the first choicefood quality - not bad, although for the quality and service i find it pricyit is a restaurant for tourists - don't think regular Singaporeans or residents as we are would go there often, looking at the myriads of choices available in town
5
Great place to go for a relaxing lunch or outdoor dinner. The choice of food is fantastic. They allow you to mix and match an amazing variety of pasta and sauces. Despite that, the final product has a gourmet taste. Only lament, prices have gone up over time, a classic Singapore problem. If you are unsure the standard suggestions are just as great. The only negative, service is so so
5
The service was very satisfactory. Food is beyond expectation, tasty and very presentable. The ambiance is very accomodating and nice.
5
My boyfriend and I decided for a taste of Italy for his birthday with some friends. It's my second time and will definitely go for round three. I love the place and the food, perfect for quiet, intimate time.
4
After a long day around in the area. Very nice spot at the river side.
Very nice fresh pasta and then a great pizza from an oven.
Don't be affraid of the impression of a touristplace
5
Our pizza was one if the best I've had in Singapore (which is not saying much). Initially greeting from staff was poor however ordering and service after that was fine. Food came quick. Beer selectuin pretty good.
1
This is my second time here. Don't quite enjoy the food - salty and qualify drop. While eating, the staff is cleaning the next 2 tables and decides joined the table to ours. Making our table instead of 2 seater becomes 6 sweaters. I feel that she can do it later not when we are having the meal. Will not return agai
5
if your craving for authentic italian food, this is the best place to go to! The staff are very friendly, fast and efficient. We also got a chance to meet the head chef (Alessio) who is always checking on us about the quality of the food. The pasta are al dente, you can really tell the pasta are handmade and freshly made. The pizza is also divine overflowing with toppings!One thing i loved most and will keep me coming back for more is that the head chef is very accommodating to us even though the pasta i am craving for that day is not on a menu, and he did it anyway! The attached photo is the pasta i requested, if you guys are wondering what pasta it is, its Cacio e pepe.
3
I was on my own so sat at one of the elevated tables for 2 at the quayside. I visited on a Friday night so the place was bustling and if you sit quayside you will have to get used to a constant stream of people walking past. This wasn't an issue for me.I ordered bruschetta with mozzarella to start and this was a little bland. For a main course, I had the pasta amatricana. This was full of flavour but was let down by the penne pasta which was undercooked and quite firm. The house red I had with my meal was fine.Overall, I was a little disappointed. It could have been so good but was just about OK
3
1) They don't have any fans or any other measures to protect people sitting outdoors from mosquito attack.2) Their food Menu is good, but you have to wait and keep looking for someone to attend to you. probably less staff.3) When we ordered, the person didn't write our order anywhere, and when they bring the food outside, they simply visit each table ask "did you order this?". This also creates confusion, like someone else's order reaching somewhere else. ANd also, because of the long trip from each table, Every dish that arrived our table was cold.As per all of these issues, the restaurant was overly priced
2
Ordered a mozzarella bruschetta and it came with five pieces of French baguette with cheese on top( Italian herb you can buy from fair price) and a 1/4 sliced tomato and a cut piece of butter head lettuce. That was the deco for $9.90. Main course came a bolognese lasagne and a truffle ravioli. Bolognese lasagne was very disappointing with basically just bottled prego pasta sauce taste. While the ravioli is under cooked still hard. Took it back and microwaved it. Just brilliant! So much for overprice Italian food. However, service is good and with smiles. Food was very disappointing for the price you pay. Will not recommend this restaurant
4
My boyfriend and I chanced upon this restaurant while walking along Boat Quay. We decided to head in for some small bites and dessert after we saw that there are quite a number of people inside. We ordered Hot potato wedges and 3 scoops of Gelato. The Gelato ice cream tasted like Wall's ice cream and it was definitely not worth the $10.30. Other than this disappointment, the service was good and responsive.
5
Wow excellent service!!! staff were friendly and accommodating and food was amazing for the price!!!
5
in the 4 days we spent in singapore, we ate here 3 times...we loved the food, the location and the service...special thanks to Nicola and Wanda who took care of us so much and made us feel so welcome..we are grateful for their outstanding service.
3
After a long journey, this was the first Italian we came to on the strip of restaurants on Boat Quay. Had one of the best tables on the edge of the river with fantastic views. Initially quieter than nearby places to eat, it had started to fill up by the time we left. Service good and quick ( which suited us ) and prices reasonable for Singapore. Pasta main courses quite bland however
1
My husband and I were in Singapore at the beginning of January, 2016. We were exploring on foot the Singapore River area and decided to have lunch at this restaurant. The only positive thing I can say about our experience was that we had a nice table overlooking the river. The food was terrible. My salad, which contained arugula, was barely edible with the arugula well beyond its "end date". We had pasta dishes for our main course and they weren't good either. I had the impression the pasta sauce had been frozen and simply thawed out and reheated. When I asked the waiter for a glass of pinot grigio, he curtly replied that they didn't serve pinot grigio by the glass and had a "white wine" by the glass. Surprising for an Italian restaurant. The wine was barely drinkable. Throughout lunch, the servers were, at best, indifferent and you really felt that none of them liked their jobs or cared about their customers. Singapore is a foodie's paradise and we ate at many wonderful restaurants during our week here. This one wasn't one of them
3
This place came highly recommended, the setting is very nice and we had a riverside table, waiting for our fourth guest and ordering bottle of wine and antipasta.Soon we were told are you here to eat or not, obviously occupying a premium table they wanted us out of here as soon as possible and the next diners in.Spoiled the evening, food was not good enough to warrant going back again.Give it a miss, plenty of other fine restaurants on boat quay that value your business and understand what service is all abou
4
We were in Boat Quay with its multitude of restaurants but we fancied an Italian meal and we were not disappointed.We chose croquettes and chicken goujons which were such large starters that we shared them and really were main size portions.To follow we had fillet of beef and grilled swordfish.Both were beautifully cooked and delicious.We had a litre of house white wine and the bill came to S$190 inc service.This we considered about right for the location by the river.This is a very pleasant restaurant with cheerful,helpful staff
5
I was actually a little apprehensive about eating here on my birthday as I had prior disappointing experiences, but the food did not disappoint this time. We were seated very quickly and the food was served promptly as well. Waiter was attentive without being intrusive, and I really enjoyed my food here
4
i went there for hoping to dine by the river but due to the high capacity of the dinner crowd i could not get my desired table. but the restaurant manager tried her very best to accommodate my request by promptly transferring me to the table by the riverside once it becomes available. kudos to her and the wait staff for their friendly demeanor and their attentive service. food wise was good, nothing to complain about. the pasta i ordered was firm to the bite, great evidence that the pastas is freshly made. would definitely recommend this place to people who likes fresh pizzas and pasta
3
A dinner for two that cost a bit less than 200 Sgd on a regular dine out day is somewhat on the pricey side. No complains about the food, drinks, ambiance and service because all that were mentioned are good. I'd even say worth the money we spent if our visit will be just once a month or so. Contrary to my opening sentence, I suppose this place can still be a regular place for a dine out if starters can be chopped away and limit the wine (etc. booze) to a glass or two. With main course of pasta and a glass of wine, 30 Sgd per head will do. As for the location, we went to the one at Bukit Timah simply because this is the most convenient. As for the other two branches, they have one at Boat Quay(interior looks very enticing from the outside) and another in Siglap. Like what I said earlier, they serve good food, so basically going to be one of the hottest pick whenever the crave for meat and pasta kicks in once again :
2
One should be lucky to get a table at the riverside and so we got one. Food was just ok. The cannelloni pasta which says its chefs recommendation was not evenly cooked as the pasta was warm & the stuffing was cold. Expacts were taken care well & the locals were left uncared.
4
We tried all pasta and pizzas in singapore, i should say Pasta Fresca served great pizza. Fresh, hmmm, the aroma, superb and appetising. Must Try!
5
Delicious, fresh, affordable. Excellent wines, pizzas, and super friendly Italian chef, taking the time to talk to his clilents and advising on the wine to choose
1
Food just average and fully let down by ignorant and even rude staff. Prices are steep and do not justify the quality. Location is very nice but that's about it and they tell you to leave even before you finished your meal. Some of the staff are friendly but specifically the management is only interested in throughput and not about guests having a nice evening
4
We tried the pastas and pizzas, and both are excellent.We advise this place to anyone who is looking for a good pizza, with a fresh crust.Pros: fresh crust and pastas, nice italian ham, very good menuCons: sometimes it can be a bit long to be serve
1
Well the view is nice.... The food has nothing to do with Italy. Pizza is tasteless the cheese chosen is not actual cheese and the sauce was as good as the cheese. The four cheese pasta is a cream pasta. Do ask for the Parmesan cheese on the side to make it a cheese pasta also add salt and pepper. I bet the rest of the food is as good as what we had. Would only recommend this place for water with nice vie
3
The location overlooking the water at the south end of Boat Quay is really delightful. The tables and presentation is enticing and it appears to be the only authentic Italian food restaurant along the quay. Service was a bit shaky. Taking the orders did not seem to be a problem, once I'd summoned the waiting staff's attention (I wondered how long it would have taken had I not signalled). The biggest problem faced by the waiters is the lack of space on the very small tables to accommodate many orders - they brought over the food but seemed not to anticipate the lack of space until they arrived at the tables. I noticed this happening frequently, particulary where two guests were sitting at one table, but the waiters did not seem to learn from the previous experience! My Bruschetta Pomodoro was slightly better than tasteless - lots of it but lacking flavours. My Risotto Catalana was tasty - but more of a Paella than a Risotto - still it contained plenty of varied seafood, which was impressive. So good location, reasonable food but poor execution
3
The location is great and eating on the water is super calming but the food is just bad. We've tried pizzas different pasta and different sauces but nothing was good. The pizza has no taste at all even the Tabasco sauce couldn't fix it. The pastas sauces were even worse.
4
My family and I went to the restaurant at Boat Quay for a Saturday lunch. We ordered Alla Pastora Spaghetti, Al Funghi E Salsiccia Fettuccine and Marinara Pizza. Both the fresh pasta dishes were flavourful. Marinara Pizza was also delicious. We enjoyed our lunch in a cooling environment away from the hazy hot weather. Overall a good Italian lunch experience
3
The quality is neither good nor bad - having dinner with friends here I did order a Cesar's Salad which was honestly good and Pasta Alfredo with diced chicken, ham and garden peas in light cream sauce. And that pasta did look and taste as an undergraduate student has cooked it in his student digs. Yes you can eat it but it was totally boring. As I know and love the sophisticated Italian cuisines in which Chefs create somewhat magic from very simple ingredients I was really disappointed. I did not expect that in a professional restaurant. The idea itself is fine: you might choose from different pastas and sauces to create your own dish but they could try harder. Nevertheless, the location at Boat Quay is great and perhaps another sauce or a completely different dish like Pizza would have been a better choice. Wine was ok

This is a small italian restaurant located at the beginning of the boat quay. Food is average for an italian restaurant (spaghetti were a little bit watery and tomato salad was far from being good). However service is ok and location (specially terrace at night) is very nice
4
The cheeseless pizza was unusual and yum. The aglio kind of pasta was absolutely right. Quaint waterfront side outdoor café with an air conditioned section too
3
Great variety, lovely ambience, Fantastic pastas, really fast service but the waiters ruined my experience :(!
I see from tripadvisor that I was not the only one who visited when the waiter had a bad hair day! Should have checked out on trip advisor!
4
Lots of choice, fast service and food was great. Our waiter was rude which spoilt the overall experience but would still go back.

Been dining at pasta fresca since I was young and can say the service varies between busy hours. The food has been always above average and I would always return to satisfy my italian craving.The service is generally average but might be slower a little when the restaurant is crowded - I can see they are definitely understaffed given the capacity of the restaurant. But hey, there's a shortage of staff in every F&B outlet in Singapore so I'm sure they are having their own problems.For a mid-range restaurant, Pasta Fresca is definitely recommended
3
Food is good but not great. Everything is excellently cooked but it feels like the chef and the person who designed the menu are not the same. The sauces and accompaniments don't match the dish. Yet, the dos is excellently cooked. Old menu was actually better.

Visited the Fresco De Salvatore restaurant at Boat Quay yesterday. It is one of the first restaurants you come across when you reach Boat Quay. The other places were buzzing with activity while this one was quiet - should have taken the clue!I ordered risotto - was served in 10 mins. It was something I have never seen in Italian cuisine - yellow coloured saffron rice which was excessively sweet and chunks of chicken which were undercooked hard and chewy.I had one bite and I knew I would fall sick if I have anymore.Called the waiter and told him what the issue was - he gave a cold look and asked if I wanted the cheque.I don't like to get into an argument in a foreign country so I asked for it, paid and moved on.Terrible terrible experience. Please avoid this place

I always go to Pasta Fresca, it has literally been my home. I celebrated by birthday there and it ended being one of my best birthdays. The food their is incredible!! I recently went to Italy and the food there and at pasta fresca taste so similar!! I love all the food their. You should really go eat their if your visiting Singapore. The location and service is extra ordinary

For a historical Italian trattoria since born in Singapore, pasta fresca has been around and somehow it has implanted a basic Italian food standard. Having been to Italy and tried many authentic Italian styled food. Pasta fresca has maintain their above average standard. Not going to review much as I tried all the chef recommendation. Thus summary, the taste is good and the thought of nothing will go wrong with pasta fresca is good. Good quality ingredient and spices thus try them. No exceptional taste but won't go wrong
1
Please just go down the street a little and eat at etna - just pay 10% more. Seafood they use are obviously frozen. Spaghetti tastes the same as what I buy in the supermarket. Alla Marina looked like a soup pasta. Horrible service!! Ate at the East Coast branch. Their miserable steak that I paid $35++ for = 4 extremely thinly sliced meat that has no texture. doesn't look like what's in the menu at all. Pepperoni has much better pasta than this for the same price range. Never again

Me and my wife had lunch at Pasta Fresca Boat Quay during a recent short trip to Singapore . We ordered one pizza and one pasta, both outstanding . Usually we don't like too much cheese on our pizza but that mozzarella was so amazing that we were glad it was 'too much' ! The dough was full of flavor and cooked to perfection, much better than many pizzas we have eaten before , believe it or not, even better than many pizzas we ate in Italy ! The pasta dish had that distinctive flavor of simple and fresh ingredients which represent what the 'real' Italian food is all about. Even though we were there during lunch rush hour and the restaurant was full, the service was fast and good. We didn't experience any of the problems some reviewers reported, overall we left very satisfied and definitely recommend it
5
Never disappointed. Despite being smack in the centre of the financial district, one of the most reasonably priced Italian meals in Singapore. May not be the most romantic, but excellent food, at comparatively fabulously reasonable prices!
5
Looking for some good Italian food and this place didn't disappoint! Great pizza. Wonderful pasta selections. Great salads. Go at 7 or 730 and get to see the laser show at 8.
2
I ordered my pasta with chicken and so did my partner. Unfortunately when we bit into it they were like hard pieces of Lego in our pasta, small squares of overcooked plastic. Other than that, the pasta wasn't too bad, needed more sauce and salt. For two people with 1 entree and 2 mains and a coke each cost AUD $70 which again wasn't too bad considering the location. I would try elsewhere
5
By far, the restaurant offers the best Italian food in Singapore. The cream based pastas are my favourite, both alfredo and carbonnara, but there are more to entice your taste. The service is top notch, and the staff are always smiling. I used to frequent their shop in Katong, pity it closed couple of years ago. I started frequenting their outlets in Siglap and BoatQuay. Honestly, there has never been a disappointment

A colleague and I visited Pasta Fresca for lunch to satisfy a pasta craving. I advised my colleague not to order the set lunch as the last time I had the pomodoro pasta, it was watery and utterly insipid. Instead, we both decided to order pasta with a mushroom and asparagus cream sauce, mixed with some arrabiata sauce for a spicy kick. I'm vegetarian, so this is a pretty safe vegetarian option. My pasta arrived and I started eating it. A few bites in, I noticed something round and hard mixed into the pasta. I initially thought it may be a tortellini, but the texture was all wrong, so I checked with my colleague. I gave it to a waiter who poked around it for a bit and then went straight into the kitchen. When he came, out, he didn't even come over straight away to apologise. I had to ask him if its meat, and if they even planned on apologising. He then trotted out a rather insincere apology, defending himself by saying "well, I typed the order in correctly"...He then brought the chef out, who apologised, but was quick to point out that he didn't do it on purpose. Of course not, but did that make me feel any better? Certainly not. I was feeling physically nauseous by that point and refused their offer for a new plate of pasta. Then the manager came by, and said he heard about "my problems". I was quick to point out that, really, it wasn't my problem. They had gotten my order horribly wrong. His reply was completely insincere as well. Appalling customer service!I had to tell them that I wasn't going to pay for my pasta before they confirmed that they wouldn't charge me for it. Shouldn't they have offered that themselves, instead of merely offering me more food (which they could clearly tell I wasn't about to accept)! That they took ages to give me the bill was another source of annoyance because I just wanted to get out of there! I felt so much better that I wasn't the only who had a horrible experience. There was a group of french girls ranting at the cashier because they had been waiting for 20 minutes for their bill. TOTAL FAIL

I have always disliked paying service charge - my view is that if service is good, I will happily tip. Pasta Fresca at Boat Quay is one occasion that I remembered how much I dislike being forced to pay service charge. We had such terrible, terrible service! I was dining there for the first time with a colleague - who is a strict vegetarian for religious reasons. This is NOT something to take lightly! She recommended the restaurant as she had been before. We both ordered the same pasta sauce - an arrabiata mixed with a mushroom and asparagus cream sauce. Does that sound vegetarian to you? Because it sure sounds like it to us. Imagine our horror, when halfway through her pasta, she finds a huge piece of sausage hidden beneath layers of tagliatelle!! I was eating papardelle and was horrified, and once I started digging around in the pasta, found pieces of sausage and bacon at the bottom. She promptly sent her pasta back and we were continually surprised at the relatively nonchalant attitude of staff. Waiter who initially served us was in the kitchen discussing the dish with the chef without even starting first to apologise and investigate. He just whisked the plate off without a second glance. Only after prompting for an apology, did we receive the most insincere and dismissive apology from both the waiter and worst of all, the manager. The only sincere apology we got was from the chef but my colleague was so put off by the meal, that she felt ill and rebuffed any offers of a new plate of pasta. They offered to knock the price of her pasta from our bill. Least they could do. Waiting for the bill was another battle - we were sitting next to the register, but even then, it took a long time of us waiting and continually asking for the bill for it to finally appear. Obviously, very difficult to work out the refund! I felt very sorry for my colleague because she felt so ill from the meat cooked into her dish that she just wanted to leave ASAP. Absolutely ruined our lunch. Incredibly disrespectful attitude from staff. Never going back there again, which is a shame because overall, the pasta was not bad. But the pasta was not good enough for me to warrant having to deal with the appalling attitude of staff again. We were there for lunch but it wasn't busy enough or understaffed enough for either of those reasons to be used as an excuse for our terrible experience. Keep in mind that it ain't cheap either! My pasta was about SGD$23+As we were leaving, a big party of diners came in from the outside tables - very mad at staff too as it turns out that they'd been sitting there waiting for the bill for 20 minutes! Unbelievable. We couldn't get out of there fast enough

Pasta Fresca has the best Italian food in Singapore. Every year for my birthday dinner, I choose to go to Pasta Fresca. Since young, my parents have brought me to Pasta Fresca and I've sort of grown up with it. I have seen it change over the years but the quality and consistency of the food they serve has remained the same. I truly recommend this place for anyone who wants to have good Italian Food in Singapore!
1
We were terribly disappointing by the Chicken Pizza that was served to us..chicken was v stale n the mushrooms v v bitter...the crust tasted only of flour as the cheese was barely there..My husband ordered soup which was as bad as the Pizza...for the premium price we paid for r meal , we came back v upset n disappointed. It's just that the location is good so well , guess u'll always find the place crowded ..
1
We ate at the restaurant in the late afternoon just after it opened for dinner so it wasn't busy. We waited 30 minutes for our food (pasta and penne) and it was cold when it was served. Small portions as well. The waitresses were very prompt about removing our empty dishes though, it made us feel like they just wanted us to leave. You could smell the river a bit too
5
In spite of mixed TA reviews, we tried Pasta Fresca Da Savatore, and found nothing but excellent Italian food with an amazing riverview experience in the heart of Singapore.We enjoyed the Bruschetta Promodoro as an appetizer, and it was fresh and fantastic. The lasagne entree was filling and tasty, and the Penne Pasta entree was worth eating every bite.Both the service and food were warm and welcoming. We walked along the riverfront and were accosted by waiters attempting to hustle us into the restaurants. Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore was one of the few places in which the waitress was ready to serve but did not attempt to hard sell us into the restaurant. For Italian food in Singapore with a romantic view and a fantastic dinner, go to Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore

Loved eating by the water. Nice busy location but it wasn't loud. Food was traditional italian style.
4
If U like carbonara, this the place U should try. The taste is good and the ham is good. The homemade spaghetti is good especially when they cook al dente.
4
Always encouraging when you see plenty of people in a restaurant ...Great for kids and adults !
Side dish and pasta was tasty.
Kids scoffed their pizza
Good service and price !
Recommend it

Fantastic food, very good service despite the density of the clients. Prices are quite big, but this is Singapore.

Yesterday 22 December 2014 I was in Singapore, while I was walking on Clark Quay I decided to try a pizza at Salvatore restaurant,( 30 Boat Quay).I ordered a Parma Ham.>the look was great>the taste was very good, salty as in Italy (not sweet like in Indonesia where they add sugar, see Trattoria), the body was little crunchy (not like a soup fluffy). >I did not find any big difference form an Italian restaurant in Italy and here.>My hobby like lot of Italian man is cooking, and simplicity ( I grow up in a farm where every things was made at home with good materials by grand ma and ma) is the key for good food but difficult to do so several restaurant they add every things to the food and you can not understand what you eat.This pizza was very good, plus the view itself.>The mascarpone was good too>The espresso was like in and Italian bar. >Price, high considering a pizza, 23.5 SGD $ but if the food is good you will be happy. Very important thing I did not get sick for 2 days like in Trattoria Kunningan in Jakarta where the King of these restaurants wrote me and my wife that was out fault because we when there and have very nasty food.Conclusion>if you are a pizza lover this is a very good place to go, I have been there already 2 time in 3 weeks (also if I wrote a review only now) and the quality was the same.Now I do not know if the chef is Italian or not (an I really not care) but this is for me the best Parma Ham pizza I ever had till now in Asia. I live in Indonesia and from Jakarta to Bali no one is like this.So have fun and enjoy your food,Ciao Claudi

This restaurant, situated in a wooded quiet location, provides excellent Italian meals that actuall reflect the true article - very tasty and well presented as one would expect if you have experienced Italy. The menu catered for all our tastes with promt, professional and polite service. We had pizza and pasta, all ingredients obviously home made and of high quality.This is an experience well worth having in a quiet tranquil environmen

We've been to Pasta Fresca a couple of times in the past 3 years and were reasonably impressed by the food. However, our most recent visit this week was a terrible disappointment. To start with, the service was poor - grumpy and unsmiling staff laid the foundation for the dinner to come. We ordered the following: Burrata main course - Burrata with a platter of grilled vegetables and bread. The vegetables were cold and limp and the creaminess of the Burrata couldn't make up for the tastelessness of the rest of the platter. The Gnocchi Arrabiata was good - the sauce was deliciously spicy, however, the quantity of the pasta was disheartening - three mouthfuls at best for a pricey sum of ~SGD 20, didn't seem worth it at all. The Caprese Salad was as listless as the service - there was hardly any basil or olive oil in it, and it was pretty dry. The House pour white wine was sour and flat, and tasted like something from a 3-day open bottle. On the whole, we walked away very annoyed - the food was below average, the service awful, and the bill unnecessarily tall. It didn't help that there were mosquitoes inside the restaurant that managed to get few good bites in

On all of our visits to Singapore, we stayed & ate a lot around the Clarke quay area. We found out about BOAT QUAY, from a local & were promised lower prices & a greater selection of bars & restaurants. They are fantastic. The Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore was great. Very friendly staff great service & a fantastic location on the waters edge.Totally recommend it!

Until this day, I remember my friend telling me "if you're craving for Pasta, Pasta Fresca is the best!".Well sadly, this statement was uttered some 7+ years ago and perhaps their glory days are long behind them.We came from Asian Civilisation Museum (ACM) and was on our way to Namu Korean Dining at the end of Boat Quay. However, we were starving and Riverfront dining looks good and thus, we decided to make have dinner at Pasta Fresca - which was one of the few shops that we walked past.Funnily, there was only one waiter taking orders from the guests seated outside. Not sure if there will be a bigger crowd later on but one waiter? Come on.Anyway, the service was pretty slow in terms of order-taking but our food came pretty fast, much to our surprise.Verdict:Spaghetti Amatriciana - Why is the spaghetti so thick??! It looks that it was soaked in hot water for too long. The sauce/toppings were ok, no complains.Al Funghi E Asparagi - Sauce was delicious and flavourful. My partner order Linguini to go with this and the pasta was done al dente. Perfect.Minstrone soup - Priced at $16 you'd would expect something better but all we got was a small serving of vegetables in plain soup. Soup that tasted very bland. A very poor excuse for soup
1
We have been going to Pasta Fresca for the last 6 years. We were hugely disappointed to find today that the service was extremely poor and the quality of the food has dropped significantly. We waited 45 minutes with just two glasses of water (no bread or word from our server that the food will take some time). Finally when the meal arrived, our appetizer had no seasoning or flavor. It was so bad, we had to send it back. The main course pastas lacked flavor as well. The owner was apologetic but did not extend the courtesy of waiving the service charge or the charge for the appetizer that was sent back untouched. Very very disappointing as this used to be one of our favorite italian restaurants in the neighborhood

My husband and I ordered pasta and were both very pleased with our dishes. It was a slow Sunday night, service was fine. View over the water was lovely as the night fell and everything became lit up.
3
Unlikely the quality in Singapore is poor and who is offering traditional Italian Cuisine with fair price must be considered an exellence therefore the 3/5 (Good wine as Pierpaolo Pecorari lovely Sauvignon, Just Roberto Pinot Grigio- Garganega and Nero D'Avola, Nottola Vino Nobile)
3
The restaurant is located in a street with quite some choice of restaurants at the Quay area. Do not expect gourmet quisine but basic italian dishes. Had a pasta carbonara which was ok, the chardonay served (they only had one that was served by the glas) was poor quality. The servant was new and indicated: I'll take you order slow since I am new ... The tiramisu was fine. Overall an average experience because of the loud setting of the restaurant and quality of wine and food
2
Still sitting at this restaurant and wondering what exactly is on my plate. Food was absolutely below average. Ordered "succulent chicken breast with white wine and mushroom sauce". Got some awful flat slices of chicken drenched in oil and mushrooms. Only saving grace were the potatoes. 26SGD for that!? Highly overpriced. Avoid please
4
Visited the restaurant at the Tanjong Katong Road, had no difficulty in finding it as it is nicely lit and with a nice outdoor sitting, We were lucky to be greeted by non other than Mr. Salvatore himself, a humble man with a great passion for food, we started with some Bruschetta's which I felt could have been better presented, but they tasted nice, we then ordered a Pizza , which was nice and thin crust , as good as it can be, we tried a cola drink coming from Italy but I think the regular colas are better so maybe one can give it a miss.The Penne Arrabiatta was nice and picante as it should be and the penne pasta was Al Dente. The Tiramisu is to die for, i have travelled all over the world and could rate the Tiramisu as one of the good one's. My score would be 9/10 for the food and the excellent service and an additional 1 point for Mr. Salvatore!
4
We visited the newly established Salvo (sister restaurant of the Pasta Fresca chain) along Tanjong Katong Road for dinner. Promising affordable deli-style food, Salvo had an adequate menu and good quality food. The menu was fairly limited, but still varied enough to make for an interesting meal. We ended up trying the spinach tart with a cheese fondue (which wasn't a bona fide fondue - more of a smear of cheese sauce on the plate upon which the tart was plated), a quattro formaggi pizza and a creamy tomato sauce rigatoni. The dishes were well-prepared and well seasoned. We felt that the only downside was that pasta dishes were fixed and the waiters were reluctant to allow us to depart from the menu combinations. The ambiance was pleasant and relaxed. There's a cute deli counter with condiments and various ingredients. It's a good place to dine with the family or with a large group
5
Went by the restaurant last night for a great meal only to find that it was closed and will never open at this location again... Sad to see it go, I will check to see if they are going to open someplace else in Singapore or if there is another Pasta Fresca Da Salvatore in town.
4
Boat Quay is one of those places that tourists head for. This restaurant is saved from being a 'tourist trap' by by the number of locals employed in the area who eat there, and would stop coming if they were not happy. The view up and down river, and across to the Asian Civilisations museum and the office towers of the CBD is fantastic. I eat here at least once on every visit to Singapore. The pasta and pizza are really good and the prices are reasonable - including taxes and service charge just over $S30 for main course, drinks and coffee
4
Was attracted by the "wood-fired oven pizza" promo, so decided to have dinner at the outlet at Prinsep Place. The manager (friendly sort of person) recommended the pizza with parma ham & ruccola and we ordered linguine al cartoccio to share. Pizza was thin crust, a bit cold when it arrived but tasty contrast with the bitter ruccola and salty ham. The pasta-in-a-bag was much better - steaming hot when the bag was torn open, we dug into generous serving of mussels, squid & prawns. Sauce was yummy, clinging to the 2-coloured pasta. There was no complimentary bread with olive oil & balsamic vinegar - has that gone out of style for Italian restaurants? Price slightly on the high side - SGD20/head for mains only. Downstairs seating indoors was full, fresco full of smokers. So, we sat upstairs (climbed up a squeaky flight of stairs) and had the whole place to ourselves, that is, until a large group showed up. Background music was all English songs - thought it would have been better for Italian songs to compliment the atmosphere. Descending the squeaky staircase, my dining companion had an unfortunate encounter - her pinkie got stuck with a wooden splinter. Ouch! The manager came to the rescue - dug out the splinter with a pin (sterilised it with a flame), wiped down with an alcohol swab & on with a plaster. Thanks Jack

I was only in Singapore for 3 days and ate here 2 nights running. I live in Brunei so was delighted to find an italian restaurant with a real italian menu right by my hotel. I had the Risotto al Frutti di Mare the first night, the risotto was perfect and the taste was really good, the squid was a touch underdone for risotto but cooked to the asian standard so I was not surprised and it did not spoil the meal at all. I had a glass of house white which was a very drinkable wine, but didn't quite go with the tomato flavour of the meal, perhaps alternatives for the house wines could be available to the waiting staff depending on food choice?Second night I had Bruschetta Pomodoro, which was perfect, great olive oil, beautifully fresh tomatoes on fresh bread still warm from being toasted, and just that hint of garlic and basil. Followed this up with a Pizza Rustica (mushroom and salami), the thin base was just right, seemed to be freshly made, and the tomato sauce which went onto the base was really good.The Lime juice I had the third night was a nice surprise, for those of you who travel in SE Asia you probably know they have everything extra sweet, well the lime juice here was still slightly sharp, just like you would get in Italy.All in all great food for very reasonable cost (approx $30
4
+ family-friendly atmosphere;
+ good sea food spaghetti
+ very tasty bruschetta,
+ good garlic sauce with the tenderloin
+ good value for money
+/- service is friendly, albeit a little slow
- tenderloin a bit over-cooked
would we go again: most likely yes
3
Basic Italian menu with reasonable portions and good quality. Some of the service could have been a little sharper. The restaurant wasn't busy when we were there.
4
Good value, great pizzas, nice mozzarella salads. Try the one at Rochester or at Boat Quay for nice ambience and outdoor seating
4
Had a relaxing meal and an ok pasta in this place. Wine was good and service attentive. For singapore tourist area value is acceptable.
5
I liked the option of indoor (AC) and outdoor (food terrace area). Informal but nicer than the typical mall restaurant arrangement in Singapore. If you like you can have a drink at a nearby bar/restaurant and dessert in yet another in this RESTAURANT TERRACE (Cuppage Terrace) location.. All in a block size area
4
The pizzas are very good and a decent size for the price. The wine by the glass is a disappointment; go for the Italian beer instead, it's really nice and served ice cold. There's the usual suspects for pasta, some of the party ordered various dishes and pronounced them as good but I really can't go past the fantastic parma ham pizza. Good value for money
4
We work in UOB Plaza on Boat Quay so this is our local Italian for lunch. We always start by sharing a Piadina which is an Italian flatbread with tomato, chilli and herbs. Then you can choose a variety of oil based, cream based, tomato based, etc sauces to pair with a large selection of pastas, including several different types of vegetarian and meat stuffed pastas (eg ravioli) in addition to tagliatelle, fettuccine, spaghetti, pappardelle, not to mention home made gnocchi. There is also a good range of pizzas which are substantial and excellent too.Everything is freshly made and delicious and always comes hot out of the kitchen straight to the table. Service is friendly and efficient and overseen by a kind Italian lady. We will keep coming back every week as long as it remains this good
1
The only good point: most of the staff in the kitchen and the manager are Italians, so they should know what to do.The reality: food is very average, extremely overpriced. Service is very, very poor. The manager is not capable of doing is job: he had an argument with many customers and with most of the staff in the kitchen. I could hear him shouting in Italiana nd he was not saying nice things
4
I've had the pleasure of dining at the sixth ave. branch for more than 3 years. I prefer this branch for the following reasons. First, its less crowded and commercial as the one on Orchard. Second, given the smaller size, the staff are able to cater to your needs with greater ease. Third, the tomato crab penne pasta is perfect every time I order it. A must try dish. Pizzas are great as well. To top it off, I always receive a complimentary tiramisu cake. Great staff, great food, great location

I believe in moving on with our experiences at hotels and restaurants. Our visits to Pasta fresca on the East Coast have always been troublesome. The food has always been very good but the service and ambience not great. Every 6 months or so we will give this place another try. However our visit tonight I just feel compelled to report which I would never normally do.My husband was not keen but submitted to my daughters request as she loves the parmigiana. We ordered two tuna pizzas, mozzarella and parma ham, caprese and the parmigiana.The two pizzas and caprese came pretty promptly we had finished our beers and cokes however it took a whole bottle of wine and two requests before the parma ham and mozzarella came! I queried why this had taken so long as there is no cooking involved and everyone had finished. My daughter and I cannot eat pasta or pizza and we are always left with salad and vegetables as a choice but usually this means we get prompt service and we love our options , not today at least two hours in before I had my mozzarella cheese and parma ham. The parmigiana then came shortly after mine. Not what we wanted for a family Saturday night out no excuses apart from they dropped the parmigiana but how can a mozzarella salad take so long?We left $240 dollars poorer including drinks which we needed and completely baffled, the free desert they gave my son was not wanted as he ate this while my daughter had yet to get her food.We noticed other tables had issues but generally saw that tables seated after us had their food well before us. We even ended up requesting out bill to get paid numerous times, maybe they just wanted our company all night.Lesson learned we will not keep trying and giving the benefit of the doubt. Be warned
4
Simple food done well. Service was attentive and there were no complaints on the food quality or taste. There are a number of restaurants down here at cuppage plaza, this one is worth a visit.
3
The food is OK but not worth a second visit. I haven't tried the pizza but the pasta is average and also ordered prawns which were quite bland
3
Small restaurant close to Orchard Road, comprehensive menu with Italian dishes. Ambiance is OK, but very hot and humid outside, while cold and filled with all kitchen smells on the inside.Food is good but pricey, compared to the better options in the Food republic across the street. Needs to work on ambiance and food quality to become a fine dine place, or to work on price to compete with the food courts around
3
The food was just OK, Breadsticks wrapped in parma ham - not a great deal of effort needed there.The rack of lamb cooked as ordered but a little lacking in tasteThe swordfish - overcooked and miniscule portionThe Tiramisu - ok nothing specialThe service was woeful - be prepared to wait half an hour for each courseThey seem very understaffe
4
A new branch of this Singapore chain located at no 39 Rochester Drive. We ate here for Sunday lunch having established in advance that it looked enticing. The food and service were very good and they were attentive without being overbearing. Excellent selection of pasta and choice of accompanying sauces. Very conveniently located next to Rochester apartments

WELL for those liking Italian heres one more for gluttony . The ambience is good w=very chilled out , the ravioli is awesome . The thin crust pizza is good too . The canneloni ( vegetarian was a melt in the mouth !!! They have outlets at Bukit Timah, Boat Quay, Cuppage terrace,Rochester Road, Siglap and Tanjong Katong( I went here ). Service is fast and friendly . need booking on weekends unless you go early Met their CEO Carecci Salvatore . Amazing " chatterbox " but fun too

This review is for the Boat Quay restaurant - there are several restaurants of the same name in Singapore. We first came here when looking at the many restaurants in boat quay. The restaurant looked nice and they didn't hassle us, unlike most of them. I had some of the best steak I havre had for a while and on a second visit, I had the steak again and it lived uop to expectations. All the food was good and the service was pleasant and efficient. The location means it is expensive but it is worth it
3
The restaurant is located a minute from our hotel Holiday Inn, so we went there for lunch on our arrival day. It was not long before closing time, but there were only us and two other small group outdoors.Our waiter was slow, and forgot several things during our meal. She was running around very stressed as if the restaurant was full, but this was not necessary at all. We could not understand why she did not follow us up during our meal. It was a total lack of attention and guest focus.The food was ok, but we expect more when we go to Italian restaurants.We had bruschettas for starter, a small margherita pizza, penne pasta, risotto and fettuccine + 4 lemon ice tea. Total price was 101 SGD! Not worth it at al
2
Table is too small, can hardly put 2 main dishes and 1 side dish. Nobody bother to clear the table after finished the food and attempted to squeeze in 2 plates of desserts. The gelato taste very artificial, even for the most basic chocolate favour. Pistachio taste like cough syrup. Will not recommend to anyone
3
I felt I needed some "pasta" and followed the italian sign; in a few words, not the worst place, but very little to do with italian cuisine.I started with a beef carpaccio which was beyond expectation: tender, thin, right balance of beef and parmigiano... then, I decided to go for the most demanding test... spaghetti alla carbonara... I must say this was below standard, pasta was barely cooked (and you know we italians love pasta al dente... but this too much !) and the sauce was too close to bacon&eggs breakfast.decent selection of wines, at a reasonalble price.price overall not bad, around 65 SIN$ (abt 40 â‚¬
