The cafe was recomended by a friend. Tried the fish curry with prata, enjoyed them very well. Most of the food have mildy taste, not too strong,making them acceptable for common people.

Chanced upon this place few years back. Usually drop by for a lazy brunch of Prata and Teh Tarik and occasionally a Goreng or Briyani if there is a companion.Would recommend you to order freshly made ones else you will be disappointed. I like my pratas newly cooked and served crispy. There is a Korean restaurant right next door and several other eating places within the West Coast Plaza Mall.

I have been coming here for years and it may have changed hands and had a couple of make overs but i still consider it in my top two picks for prata stalls.I can only comment on the egg and onion prata as thats all i ever have as i find them delicious, next time ill try something else. I note people say its a bit expensive, may be it is compared to the rest but surely that is down to rent and nothing else.Maybe the sauce could do with a bit more spice

They have a good spread... Fast service & tasty food. Masala Thosai, Crispy Paratha & Teh Halia are my standard order. The place gets VERY crowded between 12 & 1230 on weekdays.. Great value for money. My colleagues swear by the masala chicken & fish curry too

We went to this place for late lunch last week of April. We ordered ;- 2 Onion Prata which was quite nice and crispy outside and red onion inside was quite sweet. The bowls of curry that came with it also very tasty - Lamb curry was good which meat was tender and sauce was full of flavor. - Chicken Murtabak almost perfect. Chicken was well maintained and tasty. Roti outside if they could make it crispy as it supposed to be would be my perfect Murtabak in Singapore. Now it's very good. (I have tried Zam Zam and this one was much better by far). The lady staff just like walking dead. She brought us one fork. For two of us with all those dishes. I had to get up and grab utensil myself. All she did was stand there and look at the ceiling. The gentlemen staffs was attentive and friendly.

Compared to my last visit the service, cleanliness and response of the staff has vastly improved. Cravings for Prata satisfied with authentic and nice curry. Service was prompt n they clear up quickly after you. Prices reasonable as it is inside a shopping centre. Good experience. Will definitely visit again

This is the place a lot of us go to for a nice crispy prata. I recommend that you do not add egg or anything. Get the plain prata which is the most crispy. The curry sauce is thick. The round pratas are rather small, so if you have a good appetite, order at least two. And do not forget to order a Tea Tarik

If you like Indian prata, mutabak and mee goring, do try this as it serves the most authentic Indian food at very affordable pricing.

Really enjoyed authentic south indian food. Staff ans service was excellent. Must visit this place if you are planning to have regular indian meals in Singapore.

One of the best prata in singapore. I eat inUnited Square Branch. Their Prata Bom is good. Prata egg and cheese also good. But the table is too closer each other. Not come on the busy hour.

Sunday 11 November; Kranji War Memorial at 7am then down to Jalan Kayu for roti, mince & peas, curry sotong and mutton gravy. Remembering those who's sacrifice made it possible.

Try a test of typical Indian food here, prata. If you are game go for the creative ones, such as milk prata, chocolate prata. Otherwise, the egg and plain ones are just as good. Try their mee goring and mutabak for a touch of Indian food

Recently, I have brought my oversea friends to Jalan Kayu to try our local Indian food. I have been to jalan kayu for Prata couple of times especially when I was in my national service time. The prata then was especially delicious. But recently, after I tried with my friends, it was still tasty but not as perfect as last time. They have improved with more varities now and even air conditioned. I believed if they could again bring back the taste last time, it will bring in more regulars food lovers

I used to live in Singapore before so I had the opportunity to experience the up and down (and up again) of this shop. The first time I came here was in 1995 and it was already famous, literary. Tried most of the food they serve and so far it has been okay experience. There were some periods when the foods were very tasty, chewy and sweet. Some other time it was not as good as before. But the last time I tried was a year ago and I think their quality is back!Regardless of the inconsistency, the foods are always acceptable to my taste. So this place is still worth to visit every time I am back to Singapore

We went to the East Coast outlet. It was the long weekend and the place was empty. Having heard a lot about it and read in numerous mags, newspapers, we finally decided to go there. Ordered the traditional Plain Prata and Teh Tarik. The verdict - Crispy, non-greasy, fluffy and very very tasty. The accompanying curry and dal were equally good. Washed it all down with a very authentic Teh Tarik. They have options for Vegetarians as well. So yes, try it out ..

Either of breakfast or a late-night snack, do try their delicious egg and onion pratas, which come with a small dish of fish curry. But don't bother to order their chicken curry - I find the meat pieces are very small and the curry tastes powdery - stick with the fish curry provided instead. Parking at the stall is usually difficult, so park at the nearby public carpark. Located nearby is Jerrys BBQ. a mainstay of the area, and the shop selling the famous chocolate cake (think it is called Lanas)

This place has been around a for years and, in all the time has hardly changed. Its unpretentious but authentic and full of character.The popular dishes are: parathas, rojak, biriyani and mutton-soup. If you are looking for comfortable surroundings for a meal with family and friends - then Thasevi will suit you. Open 24 hours - what more could you ask for
