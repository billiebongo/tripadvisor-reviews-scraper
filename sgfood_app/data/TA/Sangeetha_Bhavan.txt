why do you keep north indian options in your menu when you have literally no idea how to make it? probably the worst Pani Puri and samosa chat I have had ever in my life !Their south Indian food might be okay but I am surely not going to try i

N reasonable too. We did try at other place but finally found this was worth it...n we ate here on all the three days we stayed in Singapor

Just next to the Farrer Park MRT station is this restaurant where you can get South Indian food at Singapore Prices. Mysore dosa is good but don't convert the Singapore $ to rupees and check whether to order or not. 3 Idlis is 3 $. And it fills your stomach. Have their coffee and Mint coolers

Heard that coconut oil and turmeric are good for health. And what better way to have both than in the guise of Indian food?So down to Little India I went, getting off at Farrer Road Station of Singapore's North-East Line. Instead of going to the usual fast food style Indian restaurant at the corner of Kitchener and Serangoon Roads, I went two doors down Kitchener Road to Sangeetha Bhavan Pure Vegetarian Restaurant for my usual masala dosa (also spelled dosai or thosai). This is a pancake made from fermented flour, encasing a diced potato filling. The fermentation gives it a slightly tangy taste and is supposed to be healthier as phytic acid in the wheat is broken down, rendering the flour more digestible. The dosa I had in the past usually came with two chutneys or dips made from coconut (white) and onion (orangey), and a veggie stew or samba. But here, they included a mint chutney which was new to my palate. This mint chutney was delightful, providing a fresh spin to this vegetarian meal. As I am wont to splash liberally over the chutneys and samba over the dosa, refills are in order. At fast Indian food restaurants, there are pots where patrons can help themselves but here, refills came in elegant tiny stainless steel cups, providing a touch of class. Other signs to this include a capped jug of water at each table (free) with stainless steel utensils and paper napkins. (The fast food place only givesplastic utensils that surrender and yield when encountering the thick dosa. I ordered a mango lassi to wash down the meal but was surprised it came in a disposable foam cup, not in line with the otherwise elegant image of the restaurant. I enjoyed my meal so much that I ordered another masala dosa to go, requesting for more chutneys. I was surprised that the coconut chutney was not included. The restaurant supervisor explained that they make their coconut chutney from fresh coconut twice a day and, as they cannot guarantee when their take out food will be consumed, they cannot risk their coconut chutney going bad should the patron eats the order late. This was thoughtful of the restaurant. I recommend this restaurant highly and will come again in future to get my masala dosa fix, with a heathy dose of coconut and turmeric, of course.
