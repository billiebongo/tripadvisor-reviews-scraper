Excellent atmosphere, delicious food. Mushroom soup was just wonderful. The service was warm and friendly unlike most places on the island. The restaurant is situated in an old building tastefully renovated. Clean bathrooms.

Had an after party event here with finger foods and free flow of drinks. While I think the french fries are cold, the nachos and wedges are good. They served salad a little late. I don't drink beers and wine but others seem to enjoy the night.

I did not expect the food at Azucar t be so good. Their risotto tastes just like the ones in Italy. The mushroom soup and beet root soups are nice. Their signature dish spaghetti with truffle oil is delicious. Another signature dish crispy salmon fillet is exceptional! even the garnishing asparagus is cooked to perfection. it is sweet and crunchy and just cooked. I will go back to try their other dishes.

Was just passing this place,When I stopped by & had a glance at their Food & Bar Menu.In a minute a lady,suppose to be a owner of the place walked to me & started a conversation, which convinced me to get inside & order some food for me.I ordered a portebolo mushroom Burger & blended Tiramisu Cooler which was very delicious & feeling.The owners were so much involved in the operations that they came personably twice to meet me & check with me about the quality of food & if i was enjoying or not??The place serves wide variety of Beers & wines,may be happening place for a hangout at Night time.Will be back for sure,This time for dinner

After arriving in Singapore I was looking for a nice little bar where I could sit back and watch the world go by. After a very short wander from my hotel I found Azucar. With their friendly staff who were full of recommendations. Perfect spot for a quite beer and people watching.

A long narrow little bar, varied menu, first two choices were not available so settled for the green salad followed by the fish and chips, green salad was very good and there was quite a lot of it, so did not quite finish it.Fish and chips were OK, but always difficult to find them better than at home, I would normally try something a bit more local to the place, but the first two choices were not on that night.Had a nice cold Tiger beer, and altogether it was a pretty good meal and a reasonable price. I would go there again
