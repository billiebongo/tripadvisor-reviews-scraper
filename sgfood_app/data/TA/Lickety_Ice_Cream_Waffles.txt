Enjoy hand crafted ice and coffee here. Reasonable price. Whenever i want to be refreshed or cheered up, a scoop of ice cream does wonder. Love this place. It is indeed my happy place. Thank you Lickers!

The ice cream is good, interior decoration is good but there isnâ€™t a variety of flavour when you compare it to Inside Scoop or Baskin Robbins.

love the concept and decor. very cute in pastel colors. but they have limited choices of ice cream during our visit. we pay for $8.90 for 3 scoops. taste wise; very gooodd. not too sweet and so fruity like eating real fruits yogurt. but hope they offer more flavors. this shop is located near masjid sultan; very strategic.

Quality of waffles 3/10...nothing special and not fascinating. Disappointed with the overrated.Quality of ice creme 3/10... nothing special and tasted like any normal ice creme from a tub. Flavors variety 5/10.. nothing special.Waffles nothing special. Very simple ingredients..not worth the price. Easily can get premium quality waffles and ice creme with the price that my friends and I had paid here

I stumbled upon this shop when I needed a place to hide from the sudden downpour of the rain. What really drew me in to the shop were the interior decor. It was decorated with bright candy color that can turn any selfie a top hit on their instagram page. Of course, once I went in, I was welcomed by the sight of ice cream and the smell of waffles, or more specifically egglets. Long story short, there are two flavors for the waffles: red velvet and original or both. At the same time, there are 16 different flavors of ice cream for you to choose as your topping. It was simply delightful. My afternoon was made after having the sweet savory snack

I've been to KG a couple of times, but never spotted this Ice-cream shop (it should be quite new?) They serve Hong Kong Egglets with icecream, and I got the Passionfruit & Raspberry Sorbet as well as the Dark Angel to try. All of which were very good, a great respite from the hot afternoon sun, and a good place to chill w friends.
