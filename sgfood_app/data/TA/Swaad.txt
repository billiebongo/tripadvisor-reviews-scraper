Went there with some Gujarati friends. Cold food, not real taste of Gujarat and not very good dinning environment. Not recommended.

it's Gujarati restaurant but the taste is lip smacking. One of the best soft roti in town and equally delicious buffet spread. Weekends you have daal baati which is equally good. The veg portions are comparatively better than restaurants around and spice level also good.

We went to the restaurant after a tour of little India. We were extremely disappointed with the food. If you're diabetic then avoid at all cost. The mains had a very generous helping of sugar which made the food very unappetizing and nothing like the Gujarati food I've ever tasted before, not to mention indistinguishable from the desert. I ordered off the menu and my husband had the buffet. The staff stand around bringing out rotis which gives you the impression that they're being very hospitable and considerate however don't br fooled! In reality they're monitoring whether you're sharing your meal. My meal took ages to come through (and never arrived by our departure), I happened to snack on a small piece of papadom off my partner's plate. I was quickly told off in a rude and impolite manner not to do so by the buffet nazi. I would understand if we were only paying the price of one buffet meal and we both shared it however my meal was off the menu and was priced more than the buffet meal. Aside from the food not being authentic, staff are inhospitable and rude. Needless to say, we left after having to pay for 2 meals including mine which never arrived! There was no point arguing as the guy was relentless and $20 extra was not worth spoiling my vacation over.If you really are interested in great vegetarian food with excellent service and a welcoming environment then head to Gokuls. We certainly did and love the place

This is a Gujarati restaurant, owned by a Gujarati. They have fixed and unlimited thali options, along with the normal ala-carte Indian food. If you crave Gujarati/Indian food in Singapore, go for Swaad. Its not a big restaurant, seating is limited. Surrounded by small shops, better to search it in the map.Food is decent, you can give it a try. Not all the items in thali are delicious. They need to do a lot of improvement of chhas, sabji. Roti is very nice here

There's no Gujarati in the buffet other than a kadi with loads of sugar to make it taste like Gujju food. Rest is so ordinary served on prison quality plastic plates. Still cant believe what I ate...Travellers there are so many good restaurants all around Little India. Please avoid this one

we went with small kids to this place located in Little India and asked for no chilly food items, were very happy with the food provided esp. the cahpatis they were hot and soft. this is a vegetarian only place and hosts and servers are nice and prompt

I am visiting Singapore from Switzerland with family and some one recommend to visit this Gujarati restaurant. Sheer disappointment. Folks, just look at the menu. There is nothing Gujarati. Just that one offers Khadi or doklas doesn't make them Gujarati restaurant. We ordered a Gobi Manchurian as it had been long that we had one. The waiter asked us if we wanted dry or with gravy, wow sounded very professional we were very exited but what landed on the table was just some gobi's out of the fridge uncooked fried with some tomatoes, onions and garlic sauce with lots of oil floating. This looked as if the chef was taking some cooking classes and got mixed up with both dry and gravy. We said we did want the dish as we didn't want to spoil our vacation. The waiter didn't bother to say sorry and charged us the whole price. We ordered a Swaad thali which is $11. In fact it is a recycle of the buffet items which is $13. My wife said she didn't want one item so the waiter put back the item into the buffet and gave us another from the same buffet. Nothing great about the thali. The food and the place is just average. For me Gujarati reference is something like Rajdhani restaurant back home. The one no one can beat in Singapore is Annalakshmi (eat as much as you want and pay as much as you want) with home cooking and served by volunteers. Final verdict, don't waste you time, money and spoil you health.

One food item tasted spoil and we returned it. The head chef just heated the dish and brought the same thing again. We were not very glad that it was returned and was cursing stating that we refused to take the heated food because I dint want to pay. Though we dint make much fuzz about it, we did not eat the dish and never going there again

Swaad offers a lunch buffet with a considerable variety with the price differing on weekdays and weekends. The menu is limited to a lunch set or the buffet, along with a la Carter items, e.g. samosa. Since I wouldn't enjoy the full buffet, I opted for a lunch set, that included rice, four curries, dessert, papad, and free flow bread with which to eat the curries. The spicy curries were my favorite, and a masala chai made the whole meal. The staff/family are so hospitable and helpful

We went looking for a vegetarian restaurant in Little India and we found this one not far from Mustafa. We went at 12.30 lunch time and got in just in time as the tables filled quickly. Its a small restaurant but the food was fantastic, we went for the buffet, we also had the soup which was amazing. The service was friendly and helpful, they encouraged us to have the pumpkin dessert which was great also. We will go back for sure and i would encourage anyone else to try it out.

If you want to have healthy non oily yet amazingly tasty vegetarian gujrati food in Singapore, this is the place to be.

Very Nice good hotel at Little India for Gujarati Food Lover. Value for money hotel . Over all good experience with family
4
If you want good Indian food with taste and not worried about the ambience this is the restaurant to go.
4
Perfect Indian dinner with friends . Reasonable and hot fresh chapatis is the USP of them . Masala chaj and sweet dish are add ons ...it's good to go there around 7:30 and enjoy the buffet
5
We probably have been here at least 6-7 times over the last 4 months. It's a small food joint opposite Mustaffa gate 3 and only serves Vegetarian Gujarati and Rajasthani.The price points are very moderate and slightly lower than the regular hotels in Little India. But there has been no dishes which was below average. You can have an unlimited lunch Thali at 12$. Who can beat that! (Except Annalakshmi)My TOP picks: Hot Jalebi & Rabdi ( weekend menu), Chilli bajji, Pav Bhaji, Chats, Phulka, Kadi

If you are bored with the oily, spicy food at the restaurants and are longing for a decent, mild and seemingly healthy food, then this place is worth a visit.Authentic Gujarati food (vegetarian) which is non spicy (for some it might be too bland) with a bit of sweetness in all the dishes is what you can expect. Decor is not great and had to request the staff to switch on the Aircon when we went there for lunch. $11 buffet for lunch is okay value for money unless you eat a lot chapatis which is unlimited and served super hot. Worth a visit

Its a small restaurant near Farrer park. We stayed at Parkroyal and this was walking distance from our hotel. It serves veg gujrati food, prices very reasonably. Lunch costed 22 SGD for 3 of us and the quantity was good. I ordered Masala poori and found one poori to be very oily. It was promptly replaced when I mentioned it. Parathas are priced at 4SGD and thali at 8 SGD. There is a buffet too at 11 SGD, but we didn't try it. Highly recommended for anyone looking for good Indian vegetarian food

Homely gujarati-rajasthani food in little india. efficient service & homely quality !! they serve not thali & buffet... with a continuous flow of hot off the tawa rotis !!an unassuming little restaurant - not for you if looking for fine-dining with valet parking we went on a sunday... apparently saturday is the day for jalebi & undhiya !!

I had heard a lot about Swaad from my colleagues. I decided to visit them on a Sunday afternoon when they have their daal bathi churma. The place is very small with just about 15-20 people capacity. There is nothing fancy about the decor. It plain and simple. Just like the decor, the food is also very simple. Almost like having a meal at home. There is buffet and also a la carte option. We chose the buffet. You can chose two veggies and 2 gravies. There are poori and fresh roti which are prepared just in time. There was also dhokla with fried green chillies. The food is really nice. This was the first time my family was having Gujrati food. We liked it very much. There was sone kadhi as well to go along with the gravies. It was sweet for our taste as we usually prefer hot & sour combination. All in all we liked all the main course we tried. The desserts were also good with rasmalai and gulab jamun. It is perfect combination of good food at very reasonable rates. I will definately recommend it for pure veggie food lovers.

Sometimes a restaurant need not have grand ambience, well dressed waiters, sparking silverware to impress but if it can get the basic thing of serving good food then it does leave an impression. Swaad is one such unassuming place that serves great Gujarati food. Thali and Buffet are present for lunch (they have ala carte too). Food is delicious and has that homemade feeling. The service is simple yet sufficient, needless to say that this place is a family run business

Excellent home like gujrati food. Must visit for any gujrati visiting Singapore.
Ambiance is average , but food is really yummy.

Heard of this small jewel serving quality gujrati food .. not disappointed at all
Dont expect great interiors ... but one of the best vef food in Singappre

Swad is a small, unpretentious place that serves pretty good Gujarati food. The buffet is well worth the $12. There's free flow of buttermilk. I've eaten better Gujarati food but not in Singapore.

Most horrible service and most horrible food you can ever eat.
Everything stale. Stale yoghurt & horrible service
Please don't ever go there

Swaad is a typically Gujrati restaurant and if you want to eat Indian food of the north, this is the right place for you. The food is very very tasty and you would want to try out their thali which is utterly delicious. The food here is affordable and the staff are very friendly

A small restaurant at Desker road close to Mustafa exit 5/6, this is our go to place when we want to eat out, yet want to have home food.The very first time I visited long back, it was multi-store with seating at lvl 2 also. Now it has seating only at lvl1. It has basic ambience, home-like and tables squeezed in.Yet, the food it awesome. Thali, Swad Thali offers more than enough dishes. The hot & fresh phulkas are non-comparable with any other restaurant. It offers buffet during lunch and dinner also.Last time I tried Gobi Paratha, I am a big fan of Gobi Paratha but haven't been able to nail down a proper place, untill last week. Perfectly stuffed, big, thick, can see grated cauliflower in it, balanced spices, exactly as I wanted. Loved it!Prices are competitive and on a lower side. For the taste and quality, it is not expensive.Servers are quick. Love this place. Perfect for Bachelors missing home food, travelers missing home food, foreigners who want to try Indian Gujarati Thali and all others who droll over taste more than anything else. The place is unique in the crowded street

One of the few places serving Gujarati food. Really enjoyed their chaat items and Thali. The buffet option is really good with unlimited roti when you are really hungry.Food is closer to home food as it is not too spicy and served hot and fresh. The roti especially are served nice and hot. Great option for families and friends trying out Gujarati food

Went for weekend buffet lunch in this small family style Gujarati restaurant. Lunch buffet was very cheap at 12.90++.Adequate items from appetizer, salad, curries, veggies, rice and a dessert. Not overly spiced or oily. Buttermilk was free flow.They will serve hot Chapati to your table as you eat. Gujarati curry was best and so was Pulav (Veg fried rice), dessert (Rasmalai) was a disappointment.Service was prompt, not so conjusted as earlier traveller claimed.Good choice for lunch or dinner at Desker road near Mustafa center
5
Everytime we visit Singapore we have to go to Swaad. Not once. The decor is simple. The focus is on the food. We usually take the buffet, start with 1 or 2 subzi's, then the chapati's come, and oh my, what a party in your mouth it is.The food is really excellent, and all that for just $10. I can not believe it

But at last, very close to mustafa so better have lunch or dinner here in pure veg. No where in singapore for this price
