I always enjoy my visit here

Nice fish head curry was very nice.....the naan was good but slightly more expensive. Chicken Bryan I was good as meat was tender.

This is my default restaurant for North Indian food. I have brought my guests there and everyone leaves very satisfied. The quaint thing about this restaurant is that they also serve Indian-Chinese food and hipster beverages which I have not tried.

Authentic food .. a bit expensive but nice ambience inside and close to train station ... on weekends the area gets crowded and hence a little hindrance .. have taken a few official guests also and they found it good!!

Jade of India serves one of the best Kashmiri Nann. Not so sweet yet soft and chewy. Definitely return again.

Food was good! Staff was nice and answer our queries on Indian cuisine. Will come and try their other curries.

This was the last meal we had in Singapore and it was the best. The place is a modest outlet but the host is very courteous, the staff helpful and the food excellent. Go for it, you will love it.

Went for Dinner and was disappointed. Tried Indian Chinese and it was below average, tasteless.Probably the most bland hot and sour soup I ever had. Chilli potato was okish.Steamed Momo were hard, I really mean hard and average tasting.Vegetarian Manchurian was ok and so was Veg Garlic Fried rice.Not sure about Indian food there. Service was ok, a bit slow

I and my friends enjoyed the ambience, the food was good, mutton beriyani was the best. Staff friendly and helped to choose the menu too. Mary was in attendance and looked after us. We were there at six, and no others but by 7.30 crowd started coming in. Nice for family. Very near to Farrer Park MRT

3. Ambience: Good.
4. Price: not too high.

A very commendable restaurant. The food is very good and arrives fast. There is a variety of Indian and Chinese cuisine. Ambience is okay.

5
visited this place for my last meal in singapore.. it was relaxing and the quiet. the food was good and reasonable,
5
Tasty food with a broad selection of mainly north indian cuisines.
Not many alcoholic items available and some starters were not available too.
However, I'd go back

I had been here a few times and was very happy with the food. Good food, good service, overall good experience. They serve Halal food (not certified due to serving liquor, but food is Halal). Recommended. Huzayf

Although it was quiet in the restaurant, the food was quite delicious and the price was affordable as well. The staff will do their best to accommodate to our taste buds, whether we want it to be less spicy or more spicy. They have a great range of menu at affordable price. A good place to start of for your journey in Indian cuisine

Throwback to yesterday's dinner with D. Had tikka chicken, cheese naan, stuffed naan, curry fish head and stir fried veggies. Total billed was S$ 64.85 inclusive of GST and Service Charge. We used #entertainerappsg 1 for 1 main course off and was told that the amount for the stirred fried veggie will be deducted. However, in the app the estimated amount deducted was around S$20 but remembered that the veggie didn't cost that much (around S$7 plus). And the curry fish head was stated as S$ 25 in menu but were charged S$ 30. Anyway only realised all the numbers when we reached home. Perhaps, will be more careful next time as the food was not bad. #burpple #burpplesg #entertainerappsg #cheatweekend

Mid Range Fine Dining Restaurant if you are staying near Mustafa / Little India area.You can order ala Carte here and the spread is good.We tried north indian food and Chinese which was decent and good and value for money.I would definitely recommend this place as the best place in this area north indian food.Other options are not as gr8 as this which i tried
4
Dined here couple of times, the food is good & the service is satisfactory.The Indian Chinese makes me feel as if am in India & the indian Tandoori starter are yummy too.The quality & quantity is also very nice.Worth the spending..!!Will defiantly visit again soon.

Located on the undisputable prime Indian dining belt of Singapore 9Race Course Road), this place is well known for its quality North Indian and 'Indianised' Chinese food. Go there with your family and you will not be disappointed.
5
Visited this restaurant twice during my stay in Singapore. A very nice restaurant for enjoying Indian food. Ambiance was good. Service was prompt. Would love to visit again during my next visit to Singapore.

Jade of India is located near Farrer Park MRT station. It serves multi-cuisine food. Visited this restaurant with family for dinner. Food served was yummy. Service was very fast. A very good place for people searching for Indian and Chinese Food.

We have visited this restaurant around 3 times. Every time we enjoyed the food and each item can be termed as delicious in true sense. The service is prompt. Restaurant is located conveniently on the race course rooad just next to farrer park mrt.The ambience is good and quiet. Its an ideal place to relish some good food with your family

Indian diners find oriental chinese food difficult to enjoy due to its bland taste and unknown ingredients. Accordingly we decided to try this restaurant which offers Indian Chinese food. It is located in the centre of the city on the Race Course road.It is a corner property with good ambiance. The staff are Indian and friendly. We ordered a no-spice dish for 3 year old baby which they gladly produced. We ordered both veg and non-veg dishes like honey chicken, chicken lollypop, stir fried veg, veg manchurian, chicken hakka noodles etc. The preparation were excellent. Even the baby enjoyed her food. Strongly recommended
5
Located conveniently in Little India but away from all dust and noise. Understand that this is a part of the Raj Goup of restaurants who are separately running a South Indian restaurant also. We went there for lunch and ordered North Indian vegetarian items. Food was very good and service was prompt and courteous. If you are in Little India and want to have good food in quite surrounding this is a good place

Jade of india won't be a disappointing visit if you are in the Little India area. The restaurant has good spread of North Indian dishes (I didn't try any South Indian dishes - so don't remember if they serve it). The locality is surprisingly quiet given it is a stone throw away (small stone, extremely good arm) from the ever crowded Mustafa area.

Our Indian friends have invited us to this place. It was after 8:30pm and there no tables on another side of the restaurant. (we were told that there two restaurants next to each other and they share the kitchen). We settled and ordered appetizers - humus & pita, and bruschetta with caramelized onions – both were excellent! For the main course we ordered Indian dishes:• Tomato, Onion, Chilly & Cucumber Raita• Paneer Palak Chaman (Fresh Cottage Cheese cooked in thick spinach gravy) was good but the portion was too small.• Daal E Raj - a combination of Black lentils & Red Kidney beans cooked with Indian spices – also was very good.• Plain Biryani - Basmati rice cooked with special, Indian spices – excellent!All was accompanied with the basket of bread: Roomali Roti, Kashmiri Naan stuffed with cherries and nuts (the bread was just OK. Naan was to oily and Roti – too dry and cold)We shared dessert:• Gulab Jamun was good and hot.• Mango Kulfi garnished with pistachio nuts also was very good.• Eggless chocolate brownie did not impress me – it was to dry.Our friends who are the excellent cooks are coming often to this place. So you need to know what to order to enjoy the food and place

Friends had recommended this restaurant for authentic Indian food. Indian , Yes. Authentic , Also yes. But that's all. It doesn't impress in any other count. Neither the ambience nor the cost is likely to pull me for a second time there. For one thing , there are so many other restaurants in Singapore where food is also authentic Indian. So no big deal there. This restaurant is in Little India ; so the fare compliments the location.I had gone there with family . Some members of the family (unlike me) were not first timers there. We didn't like like the food , which was spicy and oily : a bit too Indian perhaps. Not worth the price. Some members in the group confirmed that food used to be better during their previous visits. I believe them. With orders given in instalments , our stay there got prolonged almost till closing time. We got service , but it was not a very appetising experience to see parts of the hotel getting darkened /folded up even when we were there and one more group on another table.Dissatisfied with food quality , price and service , we didn't find overall experience very satisfying

Went there on a recommendation and the speed at which we decided to leave and the fact that we ended up in another restaurant to eventually have our dinner I guess says a lot. Not sure if it was a bad evening for the staff or this is what to be expected, but definitely not going back there in all likelihood. The vegetable dumplings seemed to have been fried in oil that had been used a multitude of times over, we couldnt even get through half a bowl of the soup that we had ordered...I have to agree with another reviewer that Raj restaurant - which is part of the same group - is way ahead in terms of food quality and cleanliness...this just left a poor taste (literally and otherwise too!

We use to visit jade of india often. But, recently i saw two cockroaches in the dining area. Dirty floor. Sticky tables. I Wonder how many roaches having party in their kitchen.
Food is just average.
1
Food Unhygienic, Meat not fresh and taste is more like a cheap imitation of authentic north indian food..
Service horrible and staff arrogant and slow...
Definitely not a place to try out again...

It happened to visit during chinese new year with friends. The appetizer is not bad being a vegetarian find few choices. The soup is just average not that fantastic. In the main course less options for vegetarians.The mango kulfi is so hard taste like Shorbet. The staffs are not attentive on there own least bother about customer. The compare to food and quality of service its not worth for money
1
Our CNY outing ended up at jade of india for lunch. Food was way below average while price was slightly higher than other restaurants in the same bracket. Worst biryani I ever had . I couldn't even finish half of the masala tea. surprisingly the raj restaurant at science park which is part of the same group was way better ..no comparison . I would never go here again

We felt like spicy Indian Chinese food one fine evening and decided to try Jade of India. The ambiance is nothing much to talk about, the interiors are unimaginative and the furniture looks rather crummy.We ordered the Crisp Chilli Baby Corn, Paneer Manchurian with gravy, and the Egg Biryani. The corn was everything it promised to be - hot, spicy, and crisp, with tonnes of food colouring, but it wasn't bad at all. The Biryani was terrible - it was supposed to be Lucknowi style but we weren't really sure what the fuss was about! The Paneer was okay, too oily, but definitely better than the Biryani.Overall, the food bordered on cheap fast food Indian style priced to a mid range restaurant. I wouldn't go back

my wife invited her team to lunch to the Jade of India in appreciation for their work over the year. we ordered 7 indian and 7 Indian Chinese dishes along with a variety of tandoor meats with a lot of Breads etcService was excellent, the food was very fresh and very tasty, the whole team enjoyed the food and all gave it the thumbs up and took the details down for home delivery,thank you staff of Jade of Indiasee you agai

great variety of food, quality is also great and service is nice & prompt. food is delicious and is available across various cuisines so not just your regular north-indian place, but a lot more variety. location is also at the corner close to the Farer Park MR

Dined here with my family and friends last Saturday. We ordered chicken tikka for starters, peas pulav, butter naan, butter rotti, mint pratha for mains and butter chicken, fish gravy, malai kofta for sides. The chicken tikka was little over cooked and it tasted tad dry. The peas they used in the pulav was the typical frozen one from the supermarket. Definitely not a restaurant quality dish. The bread dishes were normal but the sides were below average. Especially the butter chicken. The malai kofta gravy was passable but the koftas were bland and too hard. I was pretty disappointed that they don't serve kulfi and rasa malai even though it was stated in the menu. The only dessert that was available from the menu was gulab jammun. Ended our dinner with masala tea which was average. Ambience was okay, staffs were friendly but the food was really average.

This place was more like a discovery in the lunch hours. Being an Indian, looking for Indian food is automatic, especially when you are a vegetarian. I so wanted to have some paneer and daal of my taste as I was fed-up with pizza and pastas.Jade of India came out to be surprise as the Indian food served was of acceptable standards in a foreign land, the roti felt like a roti and not rubber. The tastes can definitely not be same but the effort was visible. Also a big recommendation that when walking into an Indian restaurant in foreign land, don't expect the Chinese or Italian to be as good as it should be or the Indian to be exactly what you get back home. I will recommend this place to vegetarians who want to eat Indian food

As an Indian, of course I would like my palate to not forget the taste of my land. This place was a relief after all the cuisines had already made a way into my tummy. The Chicken Rimjhim with the butter naan, the simple daal fry tasted so much better in a foreign land. But it was not all the homesickness which made my like the food, it is truly good.
