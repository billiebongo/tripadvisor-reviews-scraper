Having visited a number Hawker stands. Chomp Chomp is one of the best. Its where the locals go for an up market inexpensive meal with a great selection of stands. Best chicken wings and sting Ray.

Best place all ever to have hawker food in Singapore. Satay is exceptional but try the oyster w eggs: never eaten e better one in the whole world.
Don’t forget to try duck, noodle soup, chicken rice or whatever you Singapore flavors’ desire inspires you

When you travel and will like to a place to try out local cuisine at reasonable price, this is the place. Chomp Chomp or the local named it as Ang Sa Li is a smaller version of Newton Circus Food Center located within Serangoon Gardens. It has been around since 1972 with multiple revamps through the years. Prices are local too. Opens only for dinner. There is a underpass that leads from Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 Blk 459 basketball court to Serangoon Garden Way by foot. After exit from underpass, turn left, followed by turn right into the 1st street and walk all the way down thru Serangoon Garden Way till you see a bank with read logo. Move past the the row of shops and you will see Chomp Chomp just behind the bus stop.A good place for tourists to try. Not all stalls are excellent, generally they are delicious. Will not recommend any particular stalls here. Just try them out based on your cravings. Serangoon Gardens consists of restaurants, cafes, spas, hair salons, 6 banks, 2 food centres, local supermarket, French gourmet food store, pubs and Karaoke.Allow one to spend half a day to relax and catch up with friends or solo. Lunch, Coffee and dessert, a beer in hot afternoon, karaoke, dinner, grocery shopping

Came here for BBQ stingray at 6:30 PM on a Friday. It's very crowded among locals. BBQ stingray was very good, although not great. Loved the pandan leaf chicken from stall No. 8, and must have. Washed everything down with a big jaw of sugar cane juice like everyone else. Nice experience

Unlike the overrated, touristy hawker centres Google shows you when you search for the "best" hawker centres in Singapore, Chomp Chomp is one that probably won't show up in the list, but is definitely considered one of the best among the locals.The variety of Singapore food in here is limited - they pretty much only have BBQ seafood, BBQ chicken wings, hokkien mee and satay. But, the ones sold here are pretty much the best you can get in Singapore. Most people come here for the BBQ seafood and while every stall here is excellent, my personal favourite is Stall 1(look out for #01-01 at the bottom-right of their signboard). Prices are only slightly more expensive than the rest of Singapore but they're definitely cheaper than the touristy hawker centres. It's a tiny hawker centre though, and can get extreme crowded during the weekends. I'd suggest coming here early(6pm)on a weekday for the best experience. It's hard to get here, admittedly. I would suggest using a cab or Uber.
5
This is what I come to Singapore for! A really great variety of special local Singapore dishes, cooked fresh in front of you, eaten in a communal market setting. There's a great buzz and the variety is almost overwhelming. A good opportunity to try something new as well as old favourites as nothing is going to cost you very much. A really great atmospheric night out

Chomp Chomp was difficult to rate, not really a 4 in my book, but also definitely not a 3... we really enjoyed the food... but considering it was $70 for 2 adults and 2 kids (who didnâ€™t order much).... it seems very overpriced for the available tables / amenities and general presentation.... we love a good hawker centre but thought what we ordered was more likely $35 max.... also difficult to get there with few cabs around the closest MRT.... still great satay and stingray...
4
This hawker center is always crowded and difficult to get seats. Sugarcane juice is quite famous here and tasty comes in 2L, 3L and 5L. You need to go around for place first and then go around to get your food. Good food if you are able to locate a seat
4
It's a hawker centre, so you need to look around and order from stalls according to your tastes and what takes your fancy. You might make the odd mistake (mine was a rather unexciting beef noodle dish tonight), yet overall you can hardly go wrong with authentic BBQ fish, notably stingray and satay. Eat delicious food with the locals in a relaxed informal atmosphere, unpretentious effective service, at very affordable prices
3
Chomp chomp is quite famous place and have all varieties of seafood. It's nice and not too expensive however I didn't find anything exceptional compare to other hawker center. The main thing would be there sugar cane juice for really cheap price. It's quite tough to find seat over there so I usually will go other restaurant around unless my friend wants to eat seafood or satay.
5
A great place to get some good food. Variety of dishes. Prices are fair. Food is very good. Only con is this place is fairly busy so its hard to find a place to sit down and eat. Would definitely return.
4
The place is always crowded, but you got a lot of choices for anything BBQ.
Don't forget to get the Sugarcane Drink Tower after you feast on the food.
4
Chomp Chomp is local singapore food court. I found many good food here. but in the food court is quite dirty. Need to be improved.
4
I like the true singaporian ambiance.
It is always busy there. Lots of youngs and olds !
always croudy
good food
The washrooms are new and the food always very good
5
If you want a more authentic food market then go to Chomp Chomp at Seragoon Gardens. Great food, friendly locals and more real than Newton Circus
5
My wife and I have been to a lot of the hawker centers in Singapore. Chomp Chomp is our favorite. It’s famous for its BBQ seafood dishes, but the satay here is about the best I’ve had. Numerous other dishes are good too. For seafood, there are two places right at the front as you walk in. We think the one on the right is best, but others in my wife’s extended Singapore family think the one on the left is better. Either one, thoug(, and you can’t go wrong.If you’re staying in the central district, hop on the NorthEast (purple) MRT lineage take it to Serangoon Station. There, follow the signs to the bus interchange and take either the 315 or the 317. The trip from Clarke Quay took about 35 minutes from that station to Chomp Chomp.Best in Sing

Chomp Chomp is a local hawker centre. After the renovation, The hawker centre is now better ventilated with more fans installed. This place is famous for barbecue sting ray, Hokkien mee, satay with peanut and pineapple sauce. Be prepared to wait for a seat as it is usually very crowded
4
The Chomp Chomp is a hawker market where the locals go to eat. A great variety of dishes, all sold from tiny shops, all sharing seats and tables. The only thing you need to bring here (besides some cash) is your hunger! You can get anything from BBQ chicken wings, to stingray (their local specialty - no chili-crab here) to BBQ mushroom inside bacon-rolls...and so much more. It is a crowded and busy place, so prepare for lots of people, smells, and noise. Most importantly: enjoy while there! Best tip: Be a group of people, order "everything" and then share the dishes
4
This place is not big compared to Lau Pa Sat, Newton circus. It was poorly designed bcos, low roofing & some were not covered. We went on a rainy day so some of the seat could not be taken. But we were early (5.30pm) managed to grab a seat. Ordered some sugarcane drink, they were different sizes. We ordered, Rojak, Cken wings, satay mee, oyster omelette, satay, fry lala, grilled stingray, All were delicious. You won't see tourists here , more the local so the prices were realistic
5
One good place to find good food. Just renovation last month. The sugar cane juice here is special, got many size, from jug to towel, feel like drinking beer. If you want to eat BBQ stingray and other BBQ food, recommend you the first stall on the left from the main entrance. Parking after 10pm is free, good place for supper
5
Great selection of traditional singaporean food offerd, hygiene and seatings of the hawker could be worked on. Overall a great place for tasty treats.
4
very good and cheap hawker market. good food here are the satay sticks, char kway teow and of course wash them down with a pint of sugar cane juice
4
Great atmosphere and good place to experience a local Singaporean meal. Very reasonably priced and some unique food.
4
If you want a change from dumplings and meat skewers and crave some veggies this is the place: skewers with mushrooms (3 types), salad and other green stuff are delicious. The squid isn't bad either, in case you can't completely forego the animal protein.
5
It is complicated to get up to this hawker center as a tourist (just by bus or Uber). However, it is worth the trip! Chomp-chomp is all about stingray. Delicious, mouth-watering, tender bbq stingray with a spicy sauce! Moreover, we found a stall there serving the best Hokkien Mee I ahve ever tried in SG. Across the road, there is a 7-eleven selling iced-cold Tiger beer. Stingray+Hokkien Mee+Tiger=Heaven on earth!!!! Unfortunately, it is complicated to find an empty table there... but I guess this is a good signal of the quality of the food served at Chomp Chomp! :

Fortunately on a recent trip to Singapore last week, the great hawker centre in Serangoon Chomp Chomp reopened for business after renovation. Nothing much as changed. The laminex tables are new, the numbers on the table clearer and the fans bigger and more efficient. The food remains absolutely out of this world. My advice would be to walk around and see what all the locals are eating and ask them politely what it is. Then go to the stall and order it. On our visit we ate stingray which was delicious and melted in your mouth. Then kai lan steamed and with a delicious sauce, little chicken wings sizzling over hot coals and all washed down with sugar cane juice. The huge meal fed three of us and cost less than $20. Many visitors are reluctant to try hawker centres but don't let this one escape your attention. The food is exciting, the little stalls give the new tourist a great introduction to the local cuisine with the assurance of rigid health standards. Then wander around serangoon gardens for an extra special treat. There are food delights everywhere.
5
Definitely one of the best place for hawker food in Singapore . Been patronising this place for the past 35 years since I was a kid as my school was nearby. Upon reaching, wok and spices smell fills the air. BBQ Chicken wing, Sambal stingray, Fried carrot cake, Oyster omelette, Goreng Pisang and my favourite Fried Hokkien mee thats washed down perfectly with those Super jumbo size sugar cane juice. A lot more good food to be discovered there and very very easy on the pocket. Go for it folk . Happy Hawking !
5
Beer. Chicken wings. Sate. Rojak. RepeatIt's not the easiest to get to, but a truly Singaporean hawker experience if you make the trek. It's our local and a great spot every night. Not the cleanest. Not a lot of happy faces behind counters. But you're not going for that. You're going for the food. Don't miss the wings and chilli sauce
4
Many years since I have been back to Chomp Chomp. I still think it has the best Pisang Raja (Banana Fritters) In SG. You get a many different type of local food. You should try its satay bee hoon & Gorang Pisang or Pisang Raja. Seating can be an issue there. Prices are relatively cheap
3
I am quite sad to say that in recent years, chomp chomp have been overly hyped up causing some of the Hawkers quality to drop while still increasing their prices. However it is not to say that there are no good food there anymore.Their BBQ wings and Satays there are still delicious. In fact you don't really need to care which stall you buy them from as the quality there are all quite good. Don't waste your time queuing 1 hour for the fried prawn noodle near the entrance as it is really not that unique or So awesome that u need to queue an hour to get it. Go ahead and try it if there isn't any queue.
5
This is a paradise place for bbq food
Not only that
There are a lot of restaurants around but I think the bbq food here still the best
5
Everything we ate was cooked perfect. The stingray, noodles, chicken wings were all perfect. Will definitely go back as the other food centres are too commercial, this one is perfect.
5
This food court is certainly one of the favourite food courts of Singaporeans and tourists. It opens every day for dinner only and is always crowded esp. during weekends. You can try these yummy dishes: grilled/bbq seafood, satay, roasted chicken wings, fried Hokkien mee, carrot cake, char kway teow, satay meehoon,etc. You're advised to go there early, otherwise it will be a long queue and there may not be any seat for you. Best to go there by bus
4
Transport: From Serangoon MRT interchange, take bus 315 or 317 (10 to 25 mins ride), get off at bus stop right after passing the Chomp Chomp food centre. The routes are circle lines, so can go back at the same bus stop.Business starts at 5pm. We arrived around 7pm on a Friday, the place was already packed. The latter you get there the harder to find a seat. So better go early.We ordered a small plate of fried oyster for S$4, 10 sticks (minimum) of bbq mutton, pork and chicken for S$6, small size bbq stingway for S$12, Gong Gong for S$10, mixed bbq sticks forS$13.50, oyster cake for S$2.5, lemon sour plum juice for S$2.5, sugar cane lime juice for S$2. Total cost around S$50 was not bad for two persons.The bbq stingway is a signature dish one should not miss. For non spicy person, it is recommended to scrape off the thick spicy paste covering the fish. The fish was so good that one plate seemed insufficient. But we wanted to try other foods as much as possible, so we did not order another plate.The gong gong was similar to conch but smaller in size. It was very fresh, tender and tasty, even without any sauce. The satay and bbq varieties were above average. The oyster cake was so so and you would not miss anything even if you do not order it.For beer lovers, there is no need to ask around where you can buy cos there is only one stall at the far end on the right side. If you are non-alcoholic drinker, lemon sour plum juice or sugar cane lime juice can definitely quench your thirst and cool you down.If you still have room for more, then go to a famous dessert shop on 1/F nearby:Dessert Bowl-BOA Serangoon Garden Way, Singapore 555976 (closed on Mon.)

It's a decent place. Basically you should go here for some BBQ item. We got the BBQ Stingray and there was no shortage of places to get it. It wasn't filling but it was tasty for sure. The place was smokey. So a shower was needed when getting home. Everyone is desperate for you to buy from them which is nice because they want to serve you but ultimately I'm deducting the rating because it was too much. If I ignore a person and they keep heckling me, then I get bothered. If I say no and I still get heckled, I get really annoyed. The place is kind of small so we hard a hard time getting a table. I loved the sugar cane glasses that are huge and reasonably priced. But gosh they are so annoying and just wanna make a sale so badly. I'll probably go back for Stingray someday
3
I have visited a few hawker centres in Singapore and I would rate this one about average. We tried the stingray and it was good but the satays were just ok. I can't remember the names of the other dishes we tried, but again they were just ok, nothing to rave about.Chomp chomp isn't easily accessible by MRT but you can either walk or cab it from the train (cab took about five minutes). Half of the tables are enclosed however the other half aren't so it is best to go when the weather is fine. Get there early to ensure a table
1
While I must say the food here is good, and the atmosphere is lively I regret to say the hygiene and cleanliness levels here are really bad. When a group leaves a table they often leave behind bones etc from their meal directly on the table. The way this is cleaned is with a dirty damp rag, which gets used over and over to wipe tables without cleaning. The other unsightly activity is how the cleaners clean prawn shells from tables - they literally tear the styrofoam plates in half and use that to scoop the shells before wiping the table "clean" with the dirty rag. The filth in the place has put me off completely
4
Going chomp chomp for a late night dinner is never wrong. There are a wholesome of awesome stalls with mouth-watering food! We had BBQ stingray, Oyster omelette and Garlic Kailan this time round. Great, I would say. However, the whole place is rather smoky. Hence, you will definitely smell after you finish your meal. Parking can be difficult to find too!

Visited Chomp Chomp Food Centre for dinner tonight. It was cooling after rain. Located along Kensington Park Road, near the circus and Serangoon Garden Way (Behind the Post Office).A good varieties of local hawker food at affordable prices. Pick the table, order and pay for the food, give the table number and they deliver the food to the designated table. Estimated $21 for 2 persons.Tasty food, really enjoyed it

I grew up on Chomp Chomp food, living only 5 minutes walk from it. Open only in the evenings for dinner and supper, you'll find it packed with people by around 6.30pm. It gets even worse on Fridays to Sundays, and expect to wait around 30 mins - 1 hour for your food... IF you can even find a table to sit in. I've learnt to go to Chomp Chomp a little earlier. Around 6.00pm would be ideal, the crowd would be starting to come, but there would still be seats available. Some of the good food that I love and recommend are:- Hokkien Mee, located at the back on the right hand side of Chomp Chomp. - Chicken Wings and Satay- BBQ Sambal Stingray - Carrot Cake & Oyster Egg- Char Kway Teow. - Sugarcane juiceSome tips:- Try to find seating in the open air area. It's much more pleasant, and you don't walk away smelling like a bbq (or at least smelling less like a bbq). You also have less people standing around you trying to get a table, or people bumping into you as they walk by. - Order your hokkien mee first. It's popular and really good, and takes up to 1 hour on some days as he only cooks in batches. So order your hokkien mee, then order chicken wings or satay or bbq stingray and have those first... but save space for the hokkien mee. - Not all BBQ stingrays stalls taste the same. The sambals they use are different, so go for the one directly opposite the char kway teow stall near the front (in the middle column). They pile on the sambal as they bbq, which makes it super tasty. - a large sugarcane is REALLY large. Don't be fooled. Go for the medium if it's just you having it
4
Many Hawker stalls to choose from.
Must try stingray and chicken wings. Sugarcane can be ordered in tower if you're coming in group. Remember to tell your table number when you order.
5
There's lot of food variety in here, price quite cheap but taste good. Its like a foodcourt kinda place, so you can choose a lot of different asian food mostly chinese food
5
Always busy. Great, authentic Asian food. Seafood was very good, especially cerial and Fried prawns. A bit of a walk from closest MRT, but worth the effort. Very good value for money. Worth to wait for a table.
5
Close friends should go there together for a gathering once in a while. It is lively and filled with good eats. The price is a concern though
2
Food is generally of acceptable standard, but better quality can be found elsewhere for the same price. Popular dishes here include BBQ seafood, satay, hokkien mee, chicken wings and the gigantic glasses of sugarcane. Although touting has been prohibited by law, some hawkers can still get very pushy (and rather aggressively too).Be warned that driving in, especially during Fridays and weekends can be a lot of trouble, and parking can be a nightmare. There are 4 very reliable bus services that can get you here though: 315 and 317 from Serangoon, 73 from Toa Payoh/Ang Mo Kio and 136 from Punggol. All 4 are loop services. Be sure to check out the directions before boarding
4
Go early as parking can be a challenge. Great food to be had! Try the local version of carrot cake (a savory fried dish) and the wonton noodles at the rear of the food center is a national treasure; savory homemade bbq pork on springy noodles and a generous serving of wontons.
4
Yes its hot and hard to get table! Try to get table outside or inside (open air). I love the food, it is good. U only have few options there: seafood; carrot cake; chicken wing; noodles; and drinks! We had sugarcane and milo dinosaur with dino glass! Its very big!!
3
The food here is local hawker fares and very very crowded! It is very hard to get a tables or grab chairs during the peak hours. Certain part of the dining areas, within the centre is so hot and stuffy that you get choked on the smoke and fume from the cooking! Satay, grilled chicken wings, oyster omelettes, rojaks all very nice but I wont say that they are the best in town. Just so that they are not bad and they are under 1 roof! The best thing is the gigantic mugs of drinks!! you can get many variety of local drinks or fruit juices in this tall gigantic mug which is not seen before!!For those foreigners/tourists, you are better off going to somewhere in the food court or other food centres. You will never get a seat/table fighting with the locals!! The experience may not be a good one with sweat dripping down your face and shirt. If you want to go, better to be in a small group..like 2 or 3. But smaller group means you have less choices of food to taste. Good if you go with a local so they can be the runner for the seats or tables. You literally need to run and grab seats when they become vacant
3
Went to Chomp Chomp on a Saturday night at around 7pm, it was busy, and we knew it was going to be, so we're prepared to wait the 30 odd minutes for a table.Chomp Chomp is known for its seafood, namely the BBQ Stingray. It's tasty and well worth a try!Other good dishes there are the BBQ Satay sticks and BBQ Chicken wings. The black carrot is okay too.It's not a place to wear your best clothes as you will come away smelling of BBQ Seafood, but that just ads to the experience. The ambience is one if of seen at other hawker centres in Singapore and the smells as you walk through the place are amazing.There's no close train station, but is easy to get to by Bus and Taxi (or car if you have one). Located in Serangoon Gardens, it's only worth visiting at night as its closed during the day
4
It was my first time here and honestly I have never heard of this place despite being local. We arrived at 10.30pm and this hawker centre was packed full. I would recommend trying the 1. Sambal stingray (beware its spicy!) 2. Satays3. Fried hokkien shrimp noodles. 4. Chow Kway Teow5. Oyster omelette6. Sugar cane or lime drink! If you're a tourist, please wear proper shoes as the floor is damp and dress lightly as it is very hot, smoky and humid. Arrive early or be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes for tables. Despite that, I had a great time catching up with my family and friends. Good, authentic and local food at reasonable prices!PS Parking is tough to find so good luck :
5
Located in my mothers home suburb of Serangoon Gardens, Chomp chomp is a fantastic cheap eat and a place to enjoy the atmosphere. I recommend a visit.
4
This place is a local favorite any day anytime up to 11pm.It is not for the faint hearted foreigners on first time experience unless your mission is to explore, experiment and experience this new adventureDo not wear your new shoes and Sunday best! be prepared for a good soaking from the wet and slippery floors as well as attack from above with smoky oily air that will permeate through every strand of your beautifully permed hair.But some of the traditional local dishes are delicious, albeit, a bit heavy on the oily side. portions are small but reasonable priceThere is a good selection from many stores to satisfy most regular
5
Excellent "street-food" atmosphere, tasty food.Great place for family and friends.BBQ Stingray , Sambal Petai , Hokkien Prawn Mee , Satay , Sugar Cane Drink , Lok-Lok , Wanton Noodles , Ice Kachang , BBQ Chicken Wings.. Order a dish from each stall to get a taste of various singaporean flavours. Grab a cab. Crowds start at 6pm on weekends
5
Every time we have a visitor in Singapore, we take them to Chomp Chomp for all the local food. The carrot cake, chicken satay, bbq stingray and bbq wings are excellent. Be sure to not go at peak hours, as you'll be waiting a while to get a table.
5
Chomp Chomp is located near serangoon garden and in the middle of many terraces houses. Therefore it is inaccessible by train. Would suggest you to take a cab down if you are unfamiliar to this place. This place is also very famous among local, especially late evening for supper. A great place for gathering after work to chill and have some good quality food. This place is one of the top place to eat local food. Let me introduce some must try food whenever I go with my friends:- Sting Ray (sting ray fish with lime and chili sauce)- Sugar Cane Drink with sour plum- Good Luck chicken wing- Oyster Omelette - Taste real good!- Carrot Cake - Some people like black carrot cake which is sweet soya sauce. I prefer white carrot cake with chili.- Ah Hock Hokkien Mee - Fried noodle with prawnI hope you enjoy the feast Cheer
5
The service was unbelievable. The management was flexible to our request which made our wedding planning so much less stressful. The staff were lovely and always on point. Food was great! Atmosphere was beautiful. They really made our day that extra little bit more special. Thanks team! Definitely seeing you guys again again
5
Initially the name caught my eye when I saw it in the Lonely Planet - how can you not like a hawker stall that's called Chomp Chomp? - but when a work colleague, who lived in Singapore for 14 years, got all misty-eyed over her 'local' I had to go. I was glad I did.Ignore one piece of information in Lonely Planet - the best train station is Serangoon Central, not Toa Payoh, and the subsequent taxi ride is two minutes rather than 15. It's one of those places that is worth a lap or two just to see what's on offer. Ignore the blandishments of the hawkers on the first circuit, and keep your eyes and nostrils open. We found the food excellent, cheap and extremely tasty - each stall has its specialty so it's up to individuals which they find best - but I particularly liked the seafood noodles, the barbecued stingray and the pitchers of fresh lime juice. No doubt every dish (they all smelled great) will have its devotees.It may not be in the middle of town, but it's not a hike to get there and it is well worth the effort. Finding a table and then deciding which of the hundreds of available dishes you are going to eat will be the hardest parts of the whole experience
3
Came for dinner on a Sunday, place was crowded & crampy but luckily got 2 vacant seats for us. Stall vendors were aggressive & competitive, it's ok as long as they dont give black & long faces if we turned them down. So many Sugarcane stalls fighting for customers, i think 6. So many Satay stalls, about 5. Many BBQ seafood & many chicken wings stalls too. Competition is good but i reckon whoever the management is, 2 or 3 is good enough but not excessive as it reduces the choice of food. The most unique item i've never seen in any other food centers & hawker centers in Singapore is the humongous size of the sugarcane juice, as high as 32cm & as broad as 18cm diameter. I could see almost every table had a minimum of 3 such mugs. We tried Char Koay Teow, it was good, not bad, rating 6/10. Chicken wings were ok, crispy outside & juicy tender inside except that it's still bloody at the bones. Rating 6/10. We had satays, the pork & chicken were good but the mutton were kindof tougher. Cucumber were sliced very thinly & not to our likings. Satay sauce was on the sweeter side but palatable. Rating 6/10. We still prefer the Malay satay stall inside Serangoon Gardens Market & Hawker Ctr, just across the Post Office, where their mutton & beef was unbeatable & the satay sauce was perfectly concocted. The greatest & only setback of coming to Chomp Chomp is always finding car park, a nightmare & a misery. The seats inside are warm & our attire get smelly whilst alfresco seating is cooler in the evening. Would we return, yes if we could find parking
4
Shrouded in a mist of satay grill smoke on first glance you know this is Singaporian authentic in its offerings. A pleasant little layout and vast array of dishes such as BBQ stingray (a must), Singaporian Satay, Oyster Omelette, sugar cane juice, BBQ chicken wings to name a few. Try and get there early for a table otherwise wait times could be lengthy. About a 15 minute cab ride from Bugis Junction
3
With a history dating 50 years or so, Chomp Chomp is synonymous with FOOD and known among any True Blue Singaporean. Times passed, stalls changed, and it;s a pity there are unfortunatey, stall duplications today. I think the oldest surviving stall is the fruit juice stall operated by 2 brothers.For those who know, the infamous Orchard Road "Car Park", now gone. Chomp Chomp withstood the test of time at almost the same location. I wonder when, if the government will do the greatest dis-service by pulling this great hawker food place down.
3
Standards have dropped over the years. I would have chosen newton hawker over chomp chomp. Would advice to go there via public transport. Driving is discouraged due to the lack of parking spaces

highlights:
BBQ Stingray 12 $
Carrot Cake 3 $
Rojak 4 $
Satay 3 $
Prawn noodles 3 $
Oyster omelette 4 $
one of the best hawker food place in all Singapore, in the Serangoon Gardens neighborhood!

A visit to Singapore wouldn't be the same without a meal from Chomp Chomp. Always busy and parking a problem, but we prefer to take away and enjoy. Love the food, everything tastes fantastic and very reasonably priced.
4
Retaining the layout of hawker centres from the past, this is the last surviving one where you will get a taste of what it is like to have a meal like a local in the old days. If you do not mind the long wait for a table, it is a great place to sample local street food like fried Hokkien prawn noodles (my personal favourite is Chia Keng's), fried carrot cake, satay, barbecued chicken wings and sambal stingray all under one roof. Not forgetting the fresh sugar cane juice that goes so well with these
4
This place is well known amongst locals and is often the first stop for visitors wanting to taste a variety of good local fare all in one spot.The food here is exceptional, if a little repetitive. The stalls have obviously not been curated as you'll have multiple stalls selling subtle variations of the same thing. Grilled seafood, chicken wings, satay and fried noodles are a recurring theme, and it may take a few tries/visits before you find a stall that serves something to your exact taste. Crowds are a bit insane during dinnertime, so it's best to pay this place a visit on weekdays, before 6pm or after 9pm when the dinner crowd starts to thin a little. Otherwise be prepare to stand and wait for a table
2
Used to be really good but not anymore. The reputation covers up lots of the flaws. Food not as good as before but prices are so much more expensive, compared to the same portion which you can get elsewhere. Repetitive stalls selling same dishes as per other food centres. Ventilation wasn't good eithe
4
This is the most authentic hawker places in Singapore, extremely busy fast turnover of hundreds of people every night, the smells are fantastic as is the food, the noise of the people and the food being cooked is awsome. Better if you go in a group then once you have grabed a table - no easy task - you can take turns to go and pick some dishes and drinks. If you can take a bit of heat you must have the sambal stingray but there are plenty of other choices, as Europeans one of our group felt the need to try a a local dish and ordered chicken feet, i wouldn't if i were you! But as far as the place goes you have got to try it if you can, its an experience you wont forget in a hurry

Chomp chomp is one of those places where you thought might be a good place to catch up with friends but upon arriving, you would remember why you haven't met here for a long time. Firstly, the seating is very limited. If your entourage is more than 4 people, good luck on getting seating together. Next, the ventilation is quite bad. To be fair, it got better after the renovation but it's still pretty bad. Try to sit near the back to Chomp Chomp to get a bit more fresh air. The variety of food is somewhat repetitive. Seafood, sugarcane juice in giant cups, satay, hokkien mee and BBQ chicken wings. Yes, it does sound good but the waiting time also varies according to how popular the store is. So be prepared if you are brave enough to venture here

We were lucky enough that we were staying in Serangoon Gardens so it was our local! We walked down there a couple of times to eat and everything we tried was fantastic. I'd especially recommend the sambal stingray, it's spicy but delicious! Sugarcane juice is another singaporean staple and they make it fresh in front of you and serve it in huge steins, it is as sweet as it sounds however so not for everyone! The only annoyance is trying to find a spot to sit and eat if you are a group, you either play it tactically and have someone stationed at each corner on the lookout or maybe just get there for an early dinner to avoid the hassle

Been here twice now and have loved each experience. Be adventurous and try everything! Chicken wings and sambal stingray were our favourites from our last visit and can't wait to go back.It always seems really busy so you just need to loiter around and wait for a table. It's quite smoky too from all the cooking but I think it adds to the atmosphere
5
Was spoilt for the sheer choice of fairs here, so went around all the stalls taking a bit from all, delicious!
Only gripe is slow at clearing tables but cheap !!!!!!!!!!
Worth a visit

When we finally found it using a taxi (pay attention because the location in TripAdvisor CityGuide is wrong!), we enjoyed a nice Singaporean hawker center with lots of seafood and satay.
4
A little bit out of the way but definitely worth a visit! Food is excellent and cheap as with all hawker centres. Be prepared to wait though!

Me group of friends went to check out the local fare at Chomp Chomp! This place has character, special buckets (yes Buckets!!!) for sugarcane juice, great oyster Omlettes and stingray. People recommended trying the Satays with mushroom at one of the stalls to the left upon entering. Perhaps, next time

Another great place for supper is Chomp Chomp, it will always be packed with people, crowded and hard to find a seat. Goes same for parking, very hard to find parking lot in Serangoon Garden as well. Some of the must try food include fried carrot cake, bbq chicken wings, fried oyster, cha kway tiao, rojak and the super big cup of sugar cane drink. Though nice but actually nowadays I found that the food taste standard has already dropped, but still nevertheless a good place to hang out for supper with friends
4
Whenever my friends from overseas whom likes to try local food, this is the place to go coz it has all the good food all in one place but not too expensive to try all. Plus point- I always there for satay, fried oysters eggs and down with cold cold sugarcane drink. Of coz this is not all, there is many more to try out without disappointment.Week point- not accessible by MRT and car park is limited if you drive.Be prepared- to queue up for food, wait for table and hot and humid surrounding. Average spending- around $10-15 dollars per person

You can ask around- Locals do not go out of the way just to eat at chomp chomp. Its actually very ordinary and pales in comparison to other hawker centres. To experience singapore like the locals, go to hawker centres like tiong bahru, boon lay, etc

Often visit Chomp Chomp Food Center aka Ang Sa Li or Serangoon Gardens hawker. Here there are a lot of Singapore local delights, where you can find Hokkien Mee, Char Kueh Teow, BBQ stuffs, deserts, satay and a lot more. But it is quite a small hawker so expect crowds and waiting time after 6:30pm and it's quite warm too. This is a great place to enjoy singapore food or even supper. Nearest Mrt would be Serangoon Mrt and you would have change to take bus 315 to this place. Two Thumbs up for this oldie goodie place
4
This hawkers center located in Serangoon is worth visiting. Gotta go early otherwise there is a long wait for tables and some seafood such as crabs ran out. We had BBQ stingray, BBQ prawns, BBQ red snapper, satay sticks of chicken, beef and lamb. Sugar cane juice, satay mee. It was quite an experience
5
This place can be extremely crowded, especially during the peak dinner hoursYou will find people waiting patiently beside tables as people are still 'chomping' through their various dishes - it's that popularWhen it's full of that many people and with all the stalls cooking up various delights - it also means this place gets HOTIt's hot enough being in the tropical heat, but add that mix and you know you need to be dressed lightly The food stalls vary from seafood to chicken wings and all are outstanding Once you're done here, there are plenty of other places to satisfy your tastebuds in the nearby Serangoon GardensHighly recommended if you are visiting or living here......and it's far better and cheaper than the tourist favorites of Newton Circus and Lau Pa Sa

This place never fail me whenever I need a place for supper. Local food in Afforable price and many variety to chose from. So far i had tasted most of stalls and it never disappoint my taste bud. Tumbs up!
3
This is one of the more famous hawker stalls, but not my favourite. A lot of the same things and a huge line for most of it. Serangoon gardens is just down the road, more selection, awesome duck and porridge.
5
Hawker centre that gives good varieties and excellent local foodies. yum! Yum!!! must try the bbq stingray and sugar cane juice with sour plum. Also luv the satay there ... And the aymosphere!
5
This is one of the local low end eating places. A cluster of stalls serving various food. Fried prawn noodles and BBQ chicken wings, stingrays. Food to die for.
4
Chomp Chomp very much deserves its reputation.
DO go early to ensure you can sit down to eat.
As recommended by other reviewers: the oyster omelette, the satays, the barbecue stingray and the freshly-pressed sugar cane drink are a must!

The chomp chomp food center is near Serangoon and lorongchuan(?), northern Singapore area. I read someone else's review on line and decided to explore our dinner in a new place. This area looks famous for local seafood with affordable price of course. Unfortunately, there is no mrt around here you can get here only by a bus or a taxi unless u drive urself. The place seemed pretty busy when we got there around 8 at night but we were seated not long after. We were pretty hungry and were being exited to explore new restaurants, so we ended up ordering 6 foods for two ppl! HahaSpicy Bbq squid, grilled lobster, sting ray, fried rice, lala and bbq wings. :D U shouldn't forget to order a big jar of sugar cane juice if u go this place. They are so fresh! We had two XPThey were all pretty good but Spicy bbq squid and fried rice was my favorite of the dinner. The spiciness of the squid sauce went well with fried rice, thou fried rice itself was good enough! Another good thing is they were around $50 in total! If you look for a local family dinner, why dont u give a go here tonight? :

Good old local hawker food! Don't go to the wrong hawker centre though, there is another one nearby Chomp Chomp! Must tries are the satay, chicken wings, sambal stingray, hokkien mee, oyster omelette and sugar cane drink! Choose the outside seats for a less stuffy and smoke-free environment. http://poportion.blogspot.sg/2014/07/after-one-hour-interview-at-bugis-i.htm

The food is FANTASTIC! No wonder the locals come here by the droves, which means waiting for a table. Order the classics: satay, kang kong, prawn noodles, sambal grilled stingray, rojak, clams, and then wash it all down with sugar cane juice. Make sure you wear loose pants, and be prepared to roll out of there with a full belly

Things to love at Chomp Chomp:Barbecued stingrayBarbecued chicken wingsPrawn noodlesSugar cane juiceThings not to love at Chomp Chomp:Lack of dining tables in comparison to the number of stallsPoor design with bad ventilation (it is a smoke chamber in there)Advice:Go there early for good tables (especially if you are going in large groups of 4 pax and above), like 6pm and earlier for dinner.Be patient and "chope" your favourite table by approaching the patrons who are about to finish and ask them if they are ok with you taking their tables after their mealPopular stalls will take more than 30 minutes to prepare your food. If you do not have the patience, go for other stalls with shorter waiting lines/lists. Check first the time needed before ordering.Lastly, ENJOY CHOMPING

hawker centres of this scale containing almost all of the Singapore Hawker delicacies are rare now and they are all spread out in different regions of Singapore. Chomp chomp is located in the Central Sg part of Singapore. Other then serving most of the local iconic food, the prices remains reasonable. Open till late.

A good cheap hawkers centre in the burbs. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing the local eatery and sampling several of the .dishes. Omelette was :-) good at around $4. Very busy centre.

The good: A very popular local hawker centre with some rather well-known dishes that are considered 'must-trys' (barbequed stingray, oyster omelette, carrot cake, and freshly-squeezed sugar cane juice come to mind). Prices that have remained 'normal' (or only slightly higher) compared to other similar hawker centres around the island. And because it's located in the middle of a private estate, it does exert a kind of ambience.The not-so-good: This place gets ridiculously crowded, especially on weekends. A car park that's not kept up with demand for years and heavy traffic getting into and out of the estate, so think very hard before driving here unless you're really early. The overall quality of the food isn't that different from many other places, and the range might be considered to be narrower than that found in many shopping malls. And some of the tables and seats aren't properly sheltered when there's a fierce rain shower, unless you don't mind eating drenched.It's not surprising that the place retains a special place in the hearts of many Singaporeans' gastronomic beliefs. But I can't help feeling that that's all it is - mostly a reputation but not much more

AWESOME selection of Singapore local eatery. Almost all the authentic Singapore cuisines are available here. We had waves and waves of drinks, char kuey tiao, BBQ fish, Hokkien fried noodle, satay... you name it. Problems: Parking and seat during meal times can be stressful especially if in a hot day. Mosquitoes are another problem in the area..

I am an Aussie regularly travelling to Singapore. This was my first trip to Chomp Chomp on the advice of a local friend. At home we have Moreton Bay Bugs or Balmain Bugs. The way they're served at Lucy BBQ (left hand side about 5 stalls in from the front) is simple, fresh and perfectly spiced, seasoned and cooked. these were the best I have enjoyed. the Stingray is awesome, especially with an ice cold Tiger beer, which is abundantly on hand
4
This is one of the more famous hawker centres in Singapore so don't be surprised if it gets very crowded around dinner time. It's not that accesible though especially if you don't stay around the area. Just ask the taxi driver to take you there. You can get almost any local dish that you can think of at this place. Do come a bit early to get a good seat. They'll serve your sugar can juice drink in bigger-than-usual mugs, just right for the different variety of food you can try

I am fond of local Singapore cuisines. And chomp chomp is always on my list whenever I visit Singapore. From Serangoon MRT station take a 315 or 317 bus to Chomp Chomp. It takes about 10-15 minutes by bus. If you're confused ask the bus driver to notify you when the bus reaches there. The chomp chomp is located just across the bus stop. On my recommended list are:1. Good luck chicken wing bbq. There are about 5 stalls that sell bbq chicken wing but this one is the best. SGD 1.20/piece. 2. Carrot cake. There is only one place that sells the carrot cake. The first on the right by the entrance. SGD 3 for small portion and SDG 5 for big portion. They sell two type of carrot cake: white one (without soy sauce) and black one (with soy sauce). Ask for extra chilli if you prefer a spicy one.3. Popiah. Located on the corner left on the third row from the entrance. You can see the sign Popiah and Rujak.4. Oyster Egg is on the corner left of the last row from the entrance.5. Sugar cane drink. 6. Stingray fish. The best is the one on the farthest right of the first row. If you are first timer you have to pay first and quote your table number. They will take your order and deliver the foods to you

As a sgrean, I come here for a taste of real local food which wouldn't give u cut throat prices as how newton hawker centre would give u, especially as tourists. Prices are reasonable. One thing to note though is tt the place is pretty small, hence reach before 7pm if u want a place. Otherwise be prepared to wait. Satay, popiah, sugar cane juice, fried Hokkien mee, Satay bee hoon, fried chicken wings, oyster omelette, bak chok mee, u name it. Get them all here
4
It's probably one of the furthest hawker centers I've been, but it was worth it. It's authentic, the food was great but the atmosphere was superb. Make sure you get the sting ray from the stall no.1, drink sugar cane juice, get carrot cake and chicken wings
5
I love the hawker centers in Singapore but this was my first time at Chomp Chomp. We went with a local guy who helped explain how things worked and kept the price low price even lower. The food was great and the place was really buzzing so if you're looking for activity, people and the aroma of Singaporean food this a great option

I was an expat in Singapore for two years, and lived in Serangoon for my first few weeks. Chomp Chomp is famous island-wide, and all Singaporeans will mention the reputation of Chomp Chomp when you pronounce the word "Serangoon Gardens". Reality is very different. Due to its popularity, the place is extremely crowded, there are not enough tables. The place is very smelly due to the lack of space. That place is not as diverse as it used to be. Stalls now compete to sell satay, stingray, and carrot cake and offer really little food diversity. Chomp Chomp according to me is not family friendly but rather attracts a young crowd that do not live in Serangoon. After hearing so much praise about Chomp Chomp in a country obsessed with food, I honestly dislike this place. I recommend everyone to actually cross the road and eat at the other makan centre located near the Police station
4
One may find lots of good food here from barbeque chicken wings, popiah, hokkien mee, etc etc Very, very crowded all the time. We need to be there early if we want to have a seat.
3
It's far too crowded, always can't find a seat. Too hot and squeezy for me. Food is overrated and atmosphere overall is poor.
3
A tranquil village setting with delicious local hawker food fare. It serves satay (chunks of meat on a stick, like Turkish chnks of meat on a skewer).
4
One of my fave to-go place for supper. I have brought several foreign friends here for local delights and they enjoy it. I feel its less touristy compared to laopatsat or makansutra. As it'sa bit out of the way as well. During weekend dinner times, might be hard to get seats. I always smell after eating there as well. But i love the food there. Must try the sugar cane with lemon

Chomp Chomp hawker stand is a bit of a drive outside of central Singapore, but it's definitely worth the trip. Here you'll find a good collection of authentic Singapore treats in a clean and comfortable (but not airconditioned) environment. As many others have noted, the downfall is that it is small so you may have to wait for a table. Tasty things to try include sambal stingray, oyster omlette, chicken wings, chicken and pork satay, carrot cake, sugar cane juice and a variety of different noodle dishes (we tried a number and they were all great). You can tell the stall owners your table number when you place your order and they'll bring the food to your table when it's ready

Was taken here by a friend, was promised great seafood and I was not disappointed ! It's very busy and can be hard to get a seat at times. The high point was the sambal stingray , a new dish to me but tasted great. Also tried the sugarcane juice, not so sweet as you might expec
4
Nice tasty food. Its a hawker centre with lots of local cuisine. Best place to try out the following1. stir fried kang kong - 2. char kway teow (fried black noodles with cockles) 3. BBQ chicken wings 4. fried fish slices soup (very tasty fish) 5. Sambal Stingray - to die for . eat from the stall with the guy with glasses . kind of a food nazi but worth the wait
3
While it is not difficult to locate the place, but it's a hill to climb to find a parking spot. Mainly because there were simply too many shops in vicinity. Nevertheless, it's a great place to bring your foreign friends to. Think it's better than Newton.Pro: Good tasty local food, loved the environment!Con: Parking is difficult, getting a table is another issue (especially if you are in a group of more than 4), repetitive food stalls
5
It's a great place to hang out. Cosy and comfortable, authentically-Singaporean cuisine. Locations-wise, it's at Serangood Gardens so there are other food type options nearby too. Try the chicken wing, the sambal stingray, the sugarcane with plum juice and the ice-kacang.Across the street is the RK Eating house: must try the maggi goreng kampung!!! then maybe head to Bzb's for some drinks for the night.

This is a hawker centre I visit often. Most people go for the seafood there which is really fantastic. But for those who are on the budget side, don't forget to try the carrot cake and prawn noodles. They are famous for that. And also the sugarcane, be amazed by how big the cups are. ( but choose from the right stalls with more juice than water.
