Very simple place - not pretentious at all. Ramen were tasty and good. Ordering is a bit weird but we are in Singapore so dont freak out.

Brought my family for lunch. Nice cosy place that is run by 2 brothers (hence the name "Brothers Ramen").
The texture of the ramen was excellent, and the soup stock was of just the right balance (not too salty).
The Supermen is highly-recommended.

After trying out several (also great) ramen places in Singapore, this one distinguishes itself for me for some reasons.The broth is the perfect balance between too thick or too watery. It tastes delicious, and it doesn't taste like those oily versions you can find in other places either.Size portion - not too big that you leave feeling guilty or stuffed, not too small that you're still hungry afterwards. Feels like something light enough I could go for daily without planning on spending longer on a threadmill.Today was my first time there, and I already felt compelled enough to give them due credit with a nice review. Already looking forward to going back there and trying the other variations of the ramen
