The spread was better than the other outlets I've been to and the staff was incredible! They were super friendly and very proactive.

Fast and Easy to make reservations and has no problems with it.. At first i didn't know that the Seoul Garden outlet at Harbourfront Centre has the All You Can Eat Buffet until I made the reservations online..

Had a wonderful evening at Seoul Garden. We were there to break fast and to celebrate my husband bdae. The staff there especially Amy was very helpful and friendly.

We went to the restaurant on a weekday evening. It was really crowded because it was Valentine's Day. The service and food quality were average. It met expectations.

Great dining place with friends, would visit again. Recommended for students as there is an ongoing dinner promo till May 2017.

For the prices, better food could be eaten at other Korean diners. Services was satisfactory. Too bright of a diner, too.

I was there on the 24th of Feb with a good friend of mine to get our Korean cravings fixed. Firstly, we were greeted with a big hearty smile from the usher. All the staffs that were on duty that day were very friendly. They were always smiling and very efficient in their work. The food was great. Probably one of my favourite Korean joint to go to whenever i wanna satisfy my cravings. It's as close as to being authentic. Overall, i'm very satisfied with everything. The excellent service is just like the icing on the cake. Kudos to the team!

Went there for Iftar with my colleagues and we had a good time. Mariam was serving our table and she's really friendly and caring. The food was good too but I find that there's more variety in other outlets. Love the spacious setting and kpop music! Just have to improve food variety and it will be perfect! :

Reserved for 6 pax at 7pm and was being guided to our table upon arrival.The food options were good. Wide range of meat available and even cooked food. However staffs can be more attentive and friendly (:A suggestion to give all dining guest a pair of tongs rather than 1 table 1 tongs. we had only 2 pairs given and when asked for more, only 1 extra tongs was given and we were told that we are supposed to share.

All of us were surprised by the Wife spread of food variety and meat provided. For the price of $27per pax we had 2 pot of soup for steamboat and a hot plate. Definitely exceeded my expectations and created a whole new experience from the old Seoul Garden! The team must have revamped the whole buffet package. It was a worthwhile visit!
