Going to Wingzone for the first time and was delighted with their service and food. The food is affordable which ranges from $7-10.

Great customer service, only western food in the whole level 4 all other are japanese food.Burger and wings and tenders restaurant with varies sauces to choose spicy and non spicy each with 4 choices each.Well priced set burger meal before discount is 13 dollars. Wedges in photo is standard and fresh, but burgers bit small. For a lunch a 1/2 lb is more suited

Located at bugis. Guess it is a new store that's why Bugis junction and Bugis+ give out free chicken wings vouchers with min spending. Good For meat eater

Bad service with lower than average food quality. A staff were yelling to his colleague with some profanities involved. Not a good environment either. Maybe it's just one of those days for him. Not gonna return anytime soon.

I was late for my reservation but they were accomodating and the set comes with drink too great and tasty :) love their unique variety of flavours.

Ranging from 3-8 people, the group deals are worth the price. You can choose a selection of flavors but some are not up to par such as the garlic farm - it tastes bad on chicken. Nonetheless, it was a great and enjoyable time at their place

The first thing i want to commend Wing Zone Bugis+ for is their quality service. My companion and i were in a rush to eat before a movie, and so we hurried the wait staff. They responded very professionally and were accommodating, without showing any displeasure at all. Well done.The food isn't top notch, so they get one star off, but they have interesting flavours. So if you are craving unique chicken wings, give them a try.

Decided it was time for some western food. Boys wanted some burgers and husband some wings. Really tasty and you can choose your sauce and condiments.Good wings done right with just enough crisp and covered in sauce. Burgers were good and fries were tasty. I had the Caesar salad- just lettuce and cheese with sauce- tasty and ok for 6.50 otherwise I would not have purchased it

Made a reservation for 2 pax but when I arrived, there wasn't a place 'reserved' for us. Was lucky that there was an empty table. Place is small and squeezy. There was only 2 staff who were serving the food, taking orders and picking up phone calls. Had to wait for quite a while to make orders and for food to arrive. Food portion was very small, not filling. You are better off with having fast food which I am sure that you will feel more full at a much cheaper price

I really enjoyed my first time at Wing Zone! They offer a wide variety of flavors that's so delicious, it makes me want to go back for more! :p
3
Service was excellent, waiting time was reasonable as well. Had a great variety of sauces, but the boneless version can be better.

Burger is nothing like the picture, two thin patties that are of poor quality, basically the ones from the freezer section at the supermarket! Wedges barely edible they were so soggy. Wings are OK...would I order again. definitely not

Whilst on the way to the Orchard road area, we decided to stop here for lunch based on an online recommendation of halal restaurants and food places in Singapore. The inside is quite nice, with large tvs to keep you distracted until your food arrives, and plenty of places to sit. There are various meal options on the menu, including plenty of combo options which seemed better value. Once you have chosen what you want, you simply order and pay at the till. We went for a couple of shared sides including chicken wings, which were ok, although covered in a bbq source, and I had a Chicken burger with chips which was ok, although the chips could have been better. Overall not a bad place for a spot of lunch

It was my first time at Wing Zone, a US based restaurant. I went there with a few friends and so we ordered a few flavours of the boneless chicken to share. We were surprised by the wide assortment of flavours and had our go at the different flavours. The food was really good, some spicy, some sweet. A wholesome dining experience. The waiting time was long because it was made to order. Personally, I enjoy eating food hot and didn't mind waiting as we were chatting away and watching the funny show on TV.Service was good and staff is friendly and were patient when we took time to decide on what to order. A recommended place for tea break and I would recommend patrons to order larger portions or their filling burgers for a complete meal.Looking forward to going there again soon. Recommended for tourists too looking at enjoying many flavours

I visited Wing Zone at Bugis+ two Fridays ago. Portions of the boneless chicken is a little too small for my taste. I tried several different flavors of chicken. I loved the Liquid Gold and Blackened Voodoo. Although they were the same chicken breast, trying different seasonings and flavors proved to be a good experience. Blackened Voodoo is just a LITTLE too salty for me. The meals were a little too expensive for my taste to be honest, perhaps it will be on my list when i am around the area with my friends.Previous reviews mentioned rude cashiers, but I did not encounter any at all. In all, it was an interesting place to have been

Throw back to the visit to Wing Zone at Bugis+ last Friday. Tried several different flavours of boneless chicken. Essentially the same chicken breast mixed with different sauces though. Pretty interesting concept, different experience with different flavours, gonna try them all. Admittedly it is a little pricey. Lemon Zinger is my favourite

Sitting inside with the two TVs showing gags and the wall full of their sauces written graffitti style, and with the music they had playing, it felt as if we were having a meal in a cinema kiosk.Price wise, the items are reasonable. Service was pretty good and the food came quickly. Tastewise, it was rather hit and miss. I had the beef burger. While flavorful the meat was just a thin patty with BBQ smoked sauce, fresh onions and tomato slices. It was not bad, though the potato wedges that came with it looked as if they were radioactive - twisted, hard and cold.My wife had the four-piece chicken tenders, and tender they were not. Her potato wedges were just as hard. The teriyaki sauce was nice, but was also a little too sweet.Overall, it was an interesting experience but it is unlikely that we will return

Located on the 4th floor of Bugis plus is Wing Zone. Having studied in the US, I do miss wing nights and grabbing a whole bucket of wings for cheap and washed down with a cold root beer. But being in Singapore, these wings don't come cheap and no one seems to sell them in buckets (50 wings) Wing Zone is touted to have had 20 years of experimental success with their 13 flavours, originating from Florida.Looking at the menu, it really reminded me of being back at my second home. The usual items like mozarella sticks, burgers, wedges, winglets and drumlets etc. Most of it, seemed pretty affordable and they are all nett priced.This was their weekday lunch menu from 11am-3pm. I visited on a tuesday afternoon at 12pm and my colleague and I were the only customers the entire time. After you have picked your order, regardless if it's a burger or not, you have to pick a flavour.- Buffalo Bliss- Mango Fire- Nuclear Habanero- Thai Chili- Sweet Samurai- Liquid Gold- Honey Q- Garlic Parm- Cinnamon Maple- Tokyo Dragon- Lemon Zinger- Cool Ranch1. Mozzarella Sticks $6.95Cheese sticks You get 5 mozzarella sticks for $6.95. First off, the exterior of the mozzarella stick wasn't breaded, but rather just covered in flour. It was piping hot when served with the super chilled and cold salsa. This was completely unexpected but oh well! The mozzarella stick did have a long stringy cheese in the center which wasn't impressive in taste or texture. It felt very chewy and hard.The batter that covered the mozzarella stick was too thick and intense for me. I got pretty full from slowly eating one mozzarella stick.2. Chicken Tenders (4 pc) $7.95Served with a side of full-flavored version of traditional honey mustard offers blissful relief from the heat aka Liquid Gold. The chicken tenders were dry and hard. The were hot but I can presume the meat was just as frozen as the mozzarella sticks were frozen a long time ago. Not a single chicken tender tasted tender. It was another disappointment. The sauce however was it's saving grace.3. 1/4 Pound Burger $8.95The burger though small in size, was the best tasting item we had ordered. The meat was seasoned with Honey Q that had Sweet honey and smoky BBQ to deliver great Southern flavour. The meat itself wasn't as dry as the chicken tenders or mozzarella sticks. The bread felt a bit hard and stale though. The tomatoes and veggies used in the burger tasted fresh. The wedges were slightly too salty for my taste but they were fresh and crisp on every bite.4. 6 Pc Wings $7.956 pc I got a side of 6 pc wings with Tokyo Dragon which had hot honey meets classic teriyaki for an experience of ginger, soy and heat. The wings were dry but the skin of the chicken was slightly crispy. The sauce gave a sharp sweet and sour sensation. The sauce was evenly distributed amongst the 6 pieces of chicken.Overall : The food came quickly, maybe because we were the only customers during a weekday lunch time, but the food didn't satisfy any of my cravings for wings. The staff were polite and very friendly. They were also very patient and helpful when it came to picking a sauce for the wings
