Great place to order a few dishes to share and a bao each to not share. That they're moving to a "better" location is testimony to this café's success.

Value for money and friendly staffs. would visit again soon. good selection of good as well. Love the creativity!
3
ordered 3 baos and a serving of truffle fries. was empty on a friday at 6.30pm. got the salted egg chicken, salted egg prawn and chilli crab pau. were quite yummy/
4
The Bao are fantastic..especially the salted egg shrimp bao. Overall the food get 4 stars. But the place itself not great. Too much echoes, it made the place too noisy to sit down for a good meal, can only get 1 star.
5
Food was really good and unique. Will head back for more! Desserts were really unique too, love them!
4
The bao's were delicious and so tasty, service was great too. Thank you for helping my weekend hangover!
5
Tasty, unique (yes, despite the preponderance of similar hipster cafes) fusion food with great presentation to match. Reasonable pricing also makes The Bao Makers worth returning to. 5 stars!

Came here for Valentine’s Day and were amazed how we were even able to get a table here on hindsight seeing what a great experience we had. Service staff were friendly and prompt, loved the dim orange lighting and decor, food was surprisingly good at these competitive prices - we had 4 glasses of wine, a mojito, the steak, truffle fries with a chili crab bao and a salted egg yolk chicken bao, cream spinach, golden sand mushrooms, all for $128 on a Valentine’s Day night. Would come back again
5
Lunch menu revolves around baos and rice bowls with some pasta options. We've tried two different baos and a bowl and they were all very tasty and very affordable.Decoration is modern clean and although the place is not that big its feels very spacious, with some room between the bar and the tables.During dinner hours it turns into a steakbar but the baos stay in the menu, pairing with mojitos. Will definitely go back to try this combo
3
The concept is an interesting one, replacing bread with buns for their burgers. I adore the chilli crab flavour one in particular. After awhile however, I started feeling sick as all the food items apart from the salad were deep fried. A real pity that the salmon in my rice bowl was also fried, even though salmon is already an oily fish
4
Nice and cosy for gatherings big & small.
Reasonably priced with good quality food.
Food bites/appetizers snd Desserts could do with a wider range.
4
Love to try this interesting cafe which specialization in differ type of bao. Tried the chili crab and salted egg chicken bao, love it
4
2nd time here because I really really love their truffle fries!!! IT'S SO YUMMY and not forgetting their innovative baos as well!
4
Good combination of local favours with traditional chinese kon-bak Bao. Hope the restaurant keep improving to add more different tasteof Bao to the menu
4
Bao Makers is good! Food portion is abit small. Ordered 2 buns. Location is more accessible with car.
4
We had the Chilli Crab, Pulled Pork, Salted Egg Yolk Prawn, and Satay Chicken Baos, as well as the truffle fries. They all tasted great.
5
The bao is fluffy, unlike what I always had from the supermarket and it wont stick to your teeth. Been patronizing Bao Makers every now and than, update menu, price still so reasonable. Service staff was friendly but not over friendly. Definitely a place to visit for its not so common cafe menu
4
We went there with a $30 voucher gotten from Chope. We ended up topping up $17 more because we wanted to try more. We had 2 buns, chili crab and salted egg prawns. They were so good! Chili crab was just nice, not too sweet and slightly spicy. Crab meat and prawns were both fresh and they didn't skimp on the amount. Buns were not soggy either. We also ordered the seafood carbonara which was just the right amount, pasta al dente, again, they don't skimp on the ingredients. The seafood were nicely charred and fresh. We had 2 homemade iced teas as well. They were refreshing and good. Skip the truffle fries though, it's just normal, not much truffle oil in it. Overall, the food is great and worth the price paid for. Good for sharing or individual. Will recommend and return again!
5
I'm in love w the chilli crab bao and the Salted egg shrimp bao. I'm glad that I've truffle fries at a lower rate when I order the two bao. Very delicious n it's a great afternoon to spent here before swimming at Jalan besar swimming pool!
5
$5.90 for savoury bao, I would say its pretty decent and affordable. I ordered chili crab bao, salted egg shrimp bao, BBQ pulled pork burger and salmon mentai bao.All were pretty good but I think the pulled pork burger fall short to our expectations.I would highly recommend the remaining three baos
4
Food is quite good. Food choice is not much but they are generally ok in taste. Staff are nice. Good place to chat with friends
4
Food was surprisingly good. Loved the Don salmon and creamy mushroom pasta. Enjoyed their ice tea best!! Comfortable ambience.
5
Come here for the salted egg chicken bao and beef steak don :) The food was overall quite good and my friends and I liked the atmosphere here.
4
A lovely cafe with nice ambience and a varied menu. Food prices were nett and good value. We tried the salted egg chicken bao and the chili crab bao. Both were yummy but quite rich! The mentaiko salmon bowl was yummy :)
3
Food was okay but i thought it was a little pricey for the portion. Will recommend the soft shell crab and the watermelon and cucumber tea.
4
Very cousy,clean and charmy... we choose this restaurant because is near of your hotel. Good options and is cheap.
5
Very chill and nice cafe with minimalist decor. Oh and the lobster roll was simply out of this world. What an explosion of flavours in my mouth
4
The pork belly bun (kong bak bao) is the legacy of the Hokkien in Singapore. The meat is a tad dry and not fatty enough. We also ordered the chilli crab bun which is probably the best of the lot we had. The salted egg sauce drizzled on the deep fried chicken is delish but the charcoal bun was soaked and too soft. Nice ambience and cafe. Service was friendly and efficient.
4
Service was good. We tried the chilli crab bao and salted egg chicken bao.. the chilli crab dip needs more work, was watery and lacks ommph but the salted egg was super nice! Tried the seafood carbonara, a little too creamy for my liking. THe pork belly don was alright though it had a little too much garlic on top

BAO MAKERS situated in the heritage district of Jalan Besar is a concept store serving buns (sliders). They also served mains such as pastas and rice bowls as well as specialty coffees and desserts. We were here for lunch today and had the crab meat aglio olio and signature baos with nanban chicken, salted egg yolk chicken in black seasame bun and Chilli crab with deep fried mantou. Prices ranged from SGD5 for baos and SGD13 for mains, desserts start from SGD7. No GST and service charges.Overall a very refreshing and delightful experience if you fancy savoury fare. I will be back to sample the other flavourful baos on the menu
4
The dishes were a little small but were very nice. The kong ba pau certainly does not disappoint and they are generous with the fillings for each pau.
4
Loved the decor. Beautiful place for a casual afternoon tea. Baos were average though. Thought the salted egg sauce could have more salted egg taste. Chilli crab bun was really spicy..
5
This is my 3rd time there and the last 2 times I have brought my overseas friends and they all love it. It's a casual and friendly ambience and most importantly, the food is delicious!
4
Friendly service, nice & creative foods (rice bowls, buns, puddings), and lovely ambience.
Recommended for casual gatherings and lunches :)
4
Nothing too fancy but good for a quick mid-day snack. Liked the fried chicken with salted sauce most!
5
A re-porposed shophouse unit opposite the Jalan Besar Stadium, it sells the traditional steamed of fried Chinese 'Mantou' buns with interesting fillings.Other than the traditional 'kong bak bao', fillings are both fusion and reimagined dishes, such as chilli crab, salted egg, and so on.Nice, cosy, cafe atmosphere in an airconditioned enviroment, where you can sit and eat and watch the world go by.A definite must-try
5
When you put something special into a Bao, it just melt in your mouth. The best is Chili crab and egg yolk prawn. It is a self service place so not much service. One big minus is the floor. It has elevated area by the window and elevated area in front door. If you don't watch your step you will easily trib
2
It's was a cafe with a nice fusion food theme with good ambience. The baos tasted good but salad was not fresh. Reflected to staff and they just say they will reflect to the chef. Never take a look at our food and never changed the salad for us. Long Black coffee was sour.
4
With the entertainer app, I managed to enjoy 4 baos for the price of 2! My order was: chilli crab, salted egg chicken, satay chicken and veggie. All were great and I especially love the satay chicken with its fragrant and nutty peanut sauce. As well as the salted egg chicken with a savoury and flavourful salted egg sauce coupled with crisp deep fried chicken!The chilli crab came with a side of chilli crab sauce but unfortunately it was served cold :( The bun was deep fried to a slightly crisp exterior for the chilli crab but wasn't serve hot, just lukewarm. Nevertheless, the fillings were great and satisfying. We also tried the green tea pudding (since the cookie bomb was sold out) and it certainly exceeded our expectations! The green tea flavour was distinct and the pudding is milky, eggy, smooth and silky.
5
Went there on a Saturday morning. Staff was really friendly and nice. The atmosphere of the cafe was relaxing and quiet for a weekend. Feel like one of those hidden gems for the cafes in that area. Food and drinks were delicious and refreshing respectively. We ordered two baos (the salted egg yolk and satay chicken), the pork don and the chili crab pasta. All of it were well seasoned and tasty. Would definitely recommend this place!
3
Marrying the Chinese Pao with the chilli crab and salted egg sauce in a cafe setting, is a good concept. Coffee is of a good standard while food needs some adjustment. Cosy atmosphere for a slow meal.
4
Back for a second time today to this quirky little cafe not too far from Lavender mrt. Good selection of interesting baos to try, all quite tasty. Truffle chips also pretty good.
5
Visited on a weekday night, wasnt crowded. Food was cooked well and neatly plated. I tried the beef steak don, salmon mentiko don, chilli crab bao and salted egg shrimp bao. Will definitely revisit to try other items on the menu.
4
2nd time visiting, friendly and good service staffs. We ordered all different kinds of Baos, crabmeat linguine, truffle fries and calamari. Baos were really awesome!
4
Bao is nice! Pasta wasn't that nice though. Accoustics of place was quite had, so when a bunch of patrons were laughing and talking loudly, the rest of us suffered. Would be good if they could put some deco to reduced the sound reflections.
5
the consistence of the food standard is up to the marked, however a small bao is abit pricey but food is delicious, will visit again.
3
The salted egg chicken bao was delightful, but the rest of the dishes fell short of expectations. Would hope for some improvement in food quality consistency.
4
Relax environment with very delicious salted egg buns (bao). Tried both chicken and prawn ones. Very tasty salted egg sauce with juicy/ succulent chicken and prawn sandwiched by very soft and fluffy bun. We also had a pasta (beef) to share which is not bad. Coffee is decent. Ordered the Taro pudding which I feel is too rich. Overall would highly recommend to come here for the buns! Buns are around $5/$6 per piece (min 2 piece). Note that this place is not very accessible.
3
Just visited Bao Makers and tried their food. In general the food is decent to good. The food is inspired by local classics and the chef had managed to add a interesting twist to it. The pork belly bao is good. It taste sumptuous and you have a nice garlic taste. The chilli crab bao was a bit disappointing because it didn't really taste like chilli crab. The coffee was decent. I am willing to come back again to try the other items on the menu.
4
Appearance: From the outside, it looks like a 'atas' restaurant feel. But upon entering inside, it gives a very spacious and comfy feel with the deco set up. Utensils and cutlery are interestingly chosen. With a deep bowl for rice meals and a nice personalised wooden basket to hold the bao gives it a modern feel. Food: personally I love the BBQ pulled pork and salted egg chicken baos the best! Filling is generous and flavourful. Very interesting fusion and remaking something common and plain into something exciting and appealing to the eye and mouth!Salmon rice bowl is very nice as well. Rice used is very tasty and salmon is fried and drizzled with roe sauce. Effort is also made to make the lemon tea shake. With a pinch of mint in it. Nacho cheese fries came in a generous portion!Closing remarks: it can be a bit pricey but for the quality of the food, it is ok! As the baos comes in minimum 2, might be a good idea to go with another, order a main and have a Bao each!Owner says there's gonna be a new menu in oct '16! Looking forward to it.
3
Affordable price. We spend about $30 dollars for two persons. We tried the bao and noodles. Good for ppl who like eating Bao
5
easy to get reach.... the taste is good and the price is quiet affordable... went here with my little sister and my cousin...
5
Great place worth a visit. Food quality was really good and the menu is pretty innovative. Desserts were amazing. But the best part for me was the service at this place.
Ambience (inside) was good too, nice spacious setting.
4
Nice little cafe serving interesting and tasty baos of different varieties - highly recommend the Bulgogi and Salted Egg versions as well as the Truffle Fries!
4
Creative baos with interesting flavours. We tried the chili crab, pulled pork and salted egg chicken - all tasted wonderful! Really liked that there was a special chili crab dip sauce that came along.
5
Minimalist interior and nice touches. The food is outstanding and reasonably priced. Had the classic bao and the salted egg shrimp. Would recommend both! Staff were wonderful. Was able to use their wifi :)
5
My friends and I decided to order all 8 of the Baos in the menu, we loved the Chilli Crab, PulledPork, Fried Chicken Bao as well as the salted egg prawn Bao.
In addition, I loved the interior as it was rather spacious.
3
Tried the lunch sets, and they were ok but a bit expensive, maybe bao's are good.
I had the chicken lunch set while my gf had the seafood pasta, she said it didn't taste good. But my chicken tandori set was ok.
5
Visited with 3 young kids. They loved the truffle fries and fish and chips. My wife and I like the baos.
4
It was a great concept. Open face paos with unusual concoctions. The salted egg pao was a hit but felt too rich for me. The nanban pao was good but the classic pork pao is perfect right down to the sauce. For a shop that aims for hipster fusion and contemporary, getting a classic right sets it apart. Well done
4
Hard to find, but worth the trouble. Loved the salted egg bao! Service was good, wifi is so-so though. Should try the seafood pasta too!
5
Food was pretty good. The seafood carbonara was surprisingly light and not to "jerlat". The salted egg chicken Bao was good too. The salted egg sauce was just right and not too overwhelming. Will definitely go back again!
4
The area where I grew up has changed a lot. Had the opportunity to explore the area recently and came across this little place.Clean, simple and minimalist in design, the cafe serves baos with a difference. It's not your usual Char Siew or Pork buns but had the yummiest chilli crab fried Bao (I guess it's man tou to many) and salted egg fried chicken bao.Probably not the cheapest baos around as the 2 of them costed just over S$10. But for something different, I will gladly pay the price
5
Reserved a table for 7 at Bao Makers on Sunday for lunch. The staff was friendly and attentive and tried their best to clear a table for us even though we were early. Food was served in about 15 to 20mins and the place was full. Food was tasty and the Baos were very unique. In all, a very good experience.
3
Decided to try out this establishment after seeing at least 2 friends checking into the place on Facebook. Intended to take advantage of the Entertainer 1-1 but unfortunately I came during the Mother's Day weekend and it was not valid. However, the food turned out alright so not complaining! They have an interesting concept where you can order your choice bao (bun) at a minimum of 2 baos per order. They come like Kong ba baos that are overflowing with generous fillings. We tried the salted egg shrimp, salted egg prawn, BBQ pulled pork and chili crab baos and they were all pretty good! Also tried the chili crab linguine which wasn't too bad. Coffee here was a disappointment though. Definitely not one of the better ones I've had. Location isn't very convenient if you're not driving. Wouldn't mind coming back
4
Ordered chilli crab Bao and salted-egg chicken Bai. They are unique. Worth trying. May want to see how to rework on the chilli crab Bao, as it turns soft and wet on the bottom part of the Bao quickly. The cashier was quite slow, it took 10plus mins for them to take my order when there were just 2pax in front of me. In general, the staffs are friendly. So may due to overcrowded hence lack of speed
5
Well lighted and spacious design of cafe makes it a great place to hang out. They offer wonderful fusion of bao and local dishes such as salted egg shrimp, chilly crab, braised pork. Note that minimum order of bao is 2. The cafe also offers a variety of coffee and refreshing drinks.
3
Simple decoration and comfortable atmosphere. Having high expectation but not sure if the bao is made in house as it just looked like the commercial one. Nothing special about the choice of fillings but they were good in term of taste. The teriyaki chicken rice has nice appearance for sure and good for instagram-ing. I expected the rice is japanese rice but it wasn't. And I thought the sauce supposed to be on the chicken. Worst was I couldn't taste the teriyaki sauce but soy sauce on the rice. Overall, it was a good try.
3
Interesting choice of pork, chicken, crab or shrimp fillings for your buns. Tried the chilli crab bun ; fried bun was soggy and greasy, chilli crab filling was tasty with chunks of fresh crab meat. Salted egg chicken bun contained a crispy piece of chicken thigh coated in salted egg mayo cream. Tasty, but more bun than chicken. While the ideas are good, execution could do with some improvement. Would probably wait a while to revisit
4
The Bao Makers took over the colourful Windowsill Pies shop that moved to Upper Thomson. Instead of keeping the similar type of decoration, the Bao Makers stripped everything to white. From the outside the café stood out quite well due to the colour. On the inside, they also kept the minimalistic industrial look with the cemented walls and wooden furnitures, perfect for hipsters to hangout. We visited the Bao Makers on the last day of our holiday when we were quite full from our previous dinner, but at the back of my mind I always remembered my conversation with Em that I’d go and try the bao at this place. So without further contemplation I dragged hubby in and ordered two baos, the chili crab and Korean bulgogi pork. I like both but the succulent and spicy chili crab definitely delivered more flavour especially with the crispy golden bao. I really like the idea of infusing the local dish into the bao, something that I never seen before at other places. The filling for both baos were sufficient. Since Hubby was craving for dessert he also ordered a pretty serving of lemon meringue sundae. The meringue came as the topping in the shape of rose, the rest of the ingredients were lemon sponge, lemon curd and vanilla ice cream with almond slices. It was delicious but a bit awkward to be called a sundae except if you break the meringue and the sponge cake, then mix the whole thing together with the ice cream.  We had a good time at the Bao Makers and we hope they will be a one stop shop for bao and able to come up with a lot of different fillings next time we go to Singapore
