Low quality ingredients used overall. The fish we ordered was not fresh. Quantity was tiny for all main course dishes we ordered.

Ordered fried rice, a few baskets of dim sum and fried chicken. The food came hot and was delicious. Strongly recommended.

Came here with my grandma. She found the conveyor belt quite interesting. Staff were friendly, didn't have to wait too long for my food. Love the food!

Went with my family and mum on New Year’s Eve for dinner. Ordered one of the set dinners with additional Tim Sum and it was good.

I really enjoyed my recent visit there - it was my second. The food was great and the staff were friendly and cleared our dishes efficiently.

Nice experience from ordering to the food. Dim sum is good except the bun. Stir fried food are tasty. However, the meal is expensive to dine frequently.

First time dining at Tunglok Teahouse at Square 2 with family to celebrate two family member's birthday

Dinner at this place. First time.First, the restaurant captain seems on a bad mood today. Very. Unwilling to serve as I was earlier half hour before my reservation.The restaurant was crowded, half full. But it's obvious it's understaffed. Food served super slow,. I only ordered dim sum and took me 1.5 hours to finish the 6 dishes. I believe the chef do not need to cook much, just steaming. Was sitting just next to the kitchen. Chef keeps ringing bell but no server. Tension between kitchen and crew.. What a messy restaurant and super disappointed with tung lok. Just couldn't wait for the last 2 dishes. Canceled and no apologies. Super disappointed.

Avoid this place if you are looking for a full service Chinese restaurant because this place is anything but! With a conveyor belt delivering food very promptly to you, be prepared to be served microwaved food! Great idea for a quick week day lunch but definitely not for a proper sit-down family dinner

The idea of serving dimsum on conveyor belt seemed cool and we decided to check out Tung Lok Tea House. Perhaps we had higher expectations since Tung Lok is an established restaurant chain in Singapore, but the visit was a big disappointment. The place resembled a crowded, noisy fast food restaurant and it was nothing like a tea house eg Luk Yu and Yum Cha restaurants in Chinatown. Booth style seats are cramped with limited legroom (think low cost carrier) and table was small and cluttered with a clumsy condiments tray and a stack of side plates.Everything is DIY here. Browse the e-menu and order using the tablet beside the conveyor belt. Dimsum choices are very limited and most of the menu is devoted to stir fried dishes and one dish meals of rice, noodles, congee. The dim sum quality is mediocre and a far cry from other Chinese restaurant chains in Singapore such as Imperial Treasure and Canton Paradise. Among the dim sum items we ordered, only the truffle vegetarian dumpling were nicely presented and passed the taste test - thin, translucent dough wrapper encasing diced mushroom and asparagus. Due to limited choice of dimsum on the menu, we ordered a noodle dish and a vegetable dish to complete our meal. The noodles were bland while the spinach was overcooked and soggy.Prices are not cheap, close to or exceeding the prices charged by restaurants in its genre like Crystal Jade Kitchen and One Dim Sum by Imperial Treasure. At other restaurants, at least there is table service to justify the 10% service charge added on to menu prices. At Tung Lok Tea House, all the staff do is to assign customers to their tables. From ordering our food to lifting the dimsum basket and plates from the conveyor belt, it was all DIY. Utensils and paper napkins were placed in a drawer below every table, and customers had to go to the water dispenser which had neat stacks of cups beside it. Staff who were strolling along the aisles ignored the empty dimsum baskets and soiled plates stacked up at our table and would only take these away when we requested them to do so. At the end of the meal, diners have to queue up at the lone cashier's counter to make payment.Tung Lok Teahouse is a touch and go place that does little justice to Tung Lok's brand name. It is a self serviced, noisy, fast food eatery selling run of the mill food at restaurant prices and slaps on a 10% service charge just for waitstaff to greet guests and usher them to their assigned table

Food was better than average teahouse. Reasonable pricing and the dim sums are pretty cute too! Also, the food was serve fast by the automated “train”.

May enjoy whole day Dim sum for small gathering.
Using auto delivery and iPad ordering system. Less manpower?
Food are ok. SGD108 for 4pax.

Brought by my colleague for lunch. The price was reasonable.I was attracted by the adorable cartoon bun. The taste was nice and I even packet home. Overall I like the food and the interesting dining concept by delivering the food on an automated tray.

Food delivered to you via a conveyor belt. Service was very prompt. Food could be improved though...
5
Good service. Food is good but price on the high end. Love the way food is ordered and served..very automated.

Excellent dim sum quality is the best I have had. Ordering is done on individual tablets and service is fast. A must try place.

It was a dinner with my family on Mid Autumn’s festival. The food there was fine in my opinion and the way the dishes are delivered to us was kind of fun.

We happened to eat here while waiting for our connecting flight at T2. We ordered a bowl of Zha Jiang noodle, and some dim sum baskets. Foods and service just okay. It's a Teahouse anyway.

I live near the area and often frequent at Tung Lok Teahouse. It is a sushi train concept but for yum cha dishes which keeps the food fresh and made to order. The last few visits have seen a deterioration of service and quality of food. Portions are smaller for the egg tarts, the BBQ pork bun is tiny in filling, the supposedly pan-fried bean curd prawn is now deep fried with batter. What was an extreme let go was the service. On two occasions, we were dining with a family of five and we were directed to a smaller table seating for four. When I requested for an empty six seater (with the supervisor dressed in black top), we were told it's reserved but it was unoccupied the whole time we were dining there. This has left us an unsavoury feeling that it is unwelcoming, non-accommodating and frankly, non-genuine service. I am giving this rating 2 star for this reason of its lack of sincerity in service in ensuring customers dine in comfort. I hope the food quality and service improves if tung Lok teahouse is serious on retaining loyal customers

I have always liked Tunglok Tea House - particularly its braised beancurd with spinach, and its roast duck. However, I was very disappointed with its pomfret porridge, Don't bother to order it. It costs Singapore $9.50 and the amount of pomfret and the 'rice' was pathetic (especially consider that their Irish roast duck rice was about the same price and much better both in terms of quality and quantity). There were 6 small slices of pomfret, which I can still understand given that pomfret is expensive. However, the amount of porridge was really bad, considering that rice is NOT expensive. By the way, I am only 1.55 m high and I weigh only 48 kg, and I generally don't eat much. So if I say the amount was pathetic, it was pathetic. I have also given feedback to a service staff at the restaurant -hopefully the feedback was taken into consideration. In case it was not, that is why I am writing this review

I love the dim sum and their roasted duck and charsiew is also not bad. Herbal tea is washed down and can be improved with better herbal taste eg chrysanthemum and Guo otherwise it's just sweet water.

Came here for lunch periodically on working days.
Great dim sum and ala carte items.
Loved the chicken and century egg porridge and chicken feet
Seafood hor fun and fried mee USA were yummy, but slightly on the expensive price range.

The ambience are good and the staff is very friendly. However, the food sucks! Super disappointed! Bringing down the tung lok's name.

Met up with some friends at TungLok tea house in Novena square2. It was a bit difficult to find because it was well hidden in one of the corners. Ordering was done through the ipad and they served the food with their moving tray system. It cool! You can add food to your order anytime and it will just come through the small window next to your seat. The seats were rows of red and green. Very untraditional coming from TungLok. Food was also good and choices were cheaper than going to their seafood restaurant in Orchard central.

Went for lunch on second day of Lunar New Year. The air con was not working and it got very hot and stuffy. Apart from dim sum, ordered fried rice and porridge. Took more than 50 minutes for the mains to arrive. Asked the staff multiple times to no avail. Definitely not going back. BTW, I don't understand how they justify imposing service charge since you order your own food using a tablet, food gets sent to you via some sort of conveyor belt, have to queue at the counter to make payment.

Found this place after walking around Novena Square 2, just try. While i read all earlier posting as somewhat negative especially the automation, it's a fact that automation is a way of life now. But nevertheless the experience was pleasant except you got a sense of a train running by you due to the delivery of food by the automated trace. Food wise decent no complaint like the signature Cheong Fun which is good albeit a little too salty. Good enough to come again although price a tad high because of the Tung Lok brand

They have automated their services. The kitchen staff put the dish on a slider and gets it to your table on a track. You remove the dish from the slider, press a button to send the slider back to the kitchen. You place your orders on an iPad and submit. Chinese tea was sold out. That's impossible. We checked with the manager and he confirmed it is still available. More testing needed to sort out these glitches.Seating configurations have changed. They were lesser traditional round tables but many more rectangle tables. These rectangle tables have very tight elbow and legs space. There's little room between your body and the edge of the table. They packed 4 of us into what should have been a table for 2. We could only put our handbag and shopping bags on our lap or floor. It was claustrophobic. 10% service charge still applies even though it has introduced automated service. Feels like a chinese fast food restaurant. Not my cup of tea

Stumbled on this restaurant by chance . Delighted by my find . Elegant dim sum at pocket friendly prices . Had the baked barbecued pork bun and it didn't disappoint ! The congee was flavourful too . Will be back to try other items on the dim sum menu

Terrible service. The place was not packed with customers yet they gave us only 1 menu when there were 3 of us. So we helped ourselves to get more menu. The start of our horror! When we opened the the menu a small cockroach jumped out of the menu and on to the table! We leave immediately. On our way out the waitress asked us what happened and we told her about the cockroach. She didn't appear shocked but we were! Never going to step into this restaurant again! The relevant authorities should look into the hygiene standards in this restaurant

The dÃ©cor is supposed to recreate the ambience of a teahouse in Singapore in the 60's, but it looks a bit artificial. The food is a bit haphazard - some dishes are scrumptious (Signature Cheong Fun with yu tiao and prawn), some 'interesting-looking' but not that great-tasting (eg. Mushroom buns, assorted yam ring), some really unappetizing (eg. fish maw bisque, xiao long bao with almost no meat!). Maybe that's why it is often empty while others in the mall are packed
