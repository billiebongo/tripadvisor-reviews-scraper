Been to OSD before but the service today is severely poor. Understaffed, tables uncleared, food forgotten, table reservation for other patrons missed. Hapless and disappointing. Food may be ok, but service is much to be desired.

This cafe has a very relaxing environment. Lots of past-time books and games on display. The food is typical Singaporean cuisine. We get to write our orders on a little whiteboard. The starters are quite good, and I enjoyed the bandung dinosauress.

OSD is located off Upper Thomson Road, in the row of quaint shophouses off Jalan Pelatina. The decor is nostalgically designed to appeal to Asians of a certain generation (I'm not saying how many decades old we are), who remember the things we used to play with before the age of iPhones, email, PC's, and who still had to pen snail mail letters home. So, before I stepped in, I really really wanted to indulge my trip down memory lane. We had Kuah Pati to start off which, and although relatively nice, the filling wasn't as nice as memory had it. Then nasi bryani, which came in a large generous helping - but the chicken was slightly tasteless and far too big and chunky. Finally, disappointment of the day: was told no chendol left, even though it was only lunchtime on a Saturday. There were a line of home-made cakes on the counter, but darn! I really wanted the chendol. Oh well. You can't go home again, they say, and perhaps this time, they were right

After reading all the hype surrounding this place, am honestly quite disappointed by the experience. The place only tries to sell you overpriced nostalgia but the food and drinks left me quite unsatisfied.Food choices are incredibly limited, constrained to food that you can get at other places at cheaper price, like mee rebus, mee siam or nasi lemak. And not to say they are tastier than their cheaper counterparts outside.Drinks also quite diluted. Hated my teh cino which tasted more like water than milk tea. Even any prata shop can do better in terms of their drinks.Incredibly disappointed. Only saving grace is the ambiance. Won't recommend this place

A little cafe at Upper Thomson Road. Menu consists of local coffee, horlicks, ovaltine and milo and some cold drinks. Definitely true to its name, they have old school delights like laksa, curry chicken and more. We ordered the laksa (it came with cockles and chili on the side), tuckshop winglets, chocolate cake and drinks. Tops marks to the winglets and chocolate cake. Be prepared to wait just a little for the food during the lunch crowd but the staff tries their best. Overall, good ! On each table, they placed some old school toys like 5 stones and "old maid" cards. Its fun and obviously, often used. Hope the cafe will change a new pack of cards for "old maids" soon. :

They provide you with a white board and a menu card when you enter, so you need to write down your order and hand it over to them which I found unique about this place. The table set-up resemble that of a classroom.We had the nasi lemark & chicken nibblets. The food was very tasty

After missing local food from my hectic travels, this is one stop shop that I would go to to satisfy my yearning for local cuisine. From Nasi Lemak to Mee rebus to Mee siam. The Tuckshop winglets and Kueh Pie Tie is a must try. They have a second outlet at The Esplanade Mall. Service is good, Ambiance is really Old school, with Chalk boards, retro music in the background. A fun place to enjoy local cusine at a reasonable price

Visited OSD with a hungry tummy at noon, because the Hawker market close-by was still closed. Ordered Fish&Chips as I had too much asian food already while here in Singapore. As I cut my fish, Dolly Parton was loosing her man to some bad woman Jolene, sadly. After a while and endless more american medleys some Marty got lost and was being searched for. Apparently Singaporeans have a tendency for drama even while they eat. Maybe some Chinese don't get the words, but my Chips and my fish got slightly cold while listening to all this american hillbillie ups and downs...My friend ate Hainan Chicken and rice and didn't care much for Dollys fate, but as I finished this review I found him desperate to leave because the music made him depressed and aggressive, he said. lol. So, food was great, sides not too plenty, so the hunger feeling remained a while until I got coffee someplace else to fill my half empty tummy...When we left some guy was yearning about those days who were. Whatever..

The food is nothing to shout about--plain not exactly attractive food. No second visit for me. Perhaps the name is not attractive too. School food has never been a great delight for most of us as they were prepared for school children sold at reasonable prices.

Old school Delights is a place where I'll think of when I crave for simple but good food - comfort food for the soul which makes you happy! Ordered Laksa for the first time and it's better than my expectation! Creamy, rich and flavorful spicy soup base which is enhanced by the fragrant coconut milk. Fresh ingredients and garnishes to create a delightful dining experience! The tuckshop wings is a must- to-order dish. Crispy and golden fried wings with the special chilli mayo which tastes like chicken rice chili! Unique combination which I can only find it here at OSD. Drinks can be customized to your liking if you ask, which is a good thing as they're more flexible in orders. Finally, there's some games that you can play with your friends such as the Country eraser to reminisce your childhood times. Overall, it's a place suitable for gatherings since it's good and affordable!

Mee Siam is extraordinary
Nasi Lemak and curry chicken standard pretty normal.
Nice ambience for family to bring their kids here without their phones!

Old school food, brings back many good old memory. The Pulut is delicious, expensive though. Some old fashioned games are on the tables to play (while waiting for food) and on shelves for sell.

Done up to look like a school canteen as best a shop house can, this eatery along Upper Thomson Road boasts local favourites like chicken curry, hor fun, laksa, etc. The tables are arranged communal style and a small box of local games of a bygone era are placed along each table along with a couple of comics.The food is good for local cafe standards and the servings are fairly generous. Prices are average and an average meal shouldn't set you back more than SGD20/person. Overall a decent place for a laid back casual lunch if you happen to be in the area

Awesome atmosphere with awesome food! Reminds me of my childhood memories, with food that would make you go wild. Try their Curry Chicken with Rice! The 'gao' (thick) gravy is one of a kind, with rice it goes very well. The chicken, tender yet tasty goes very very well with the whole meal (S$9.80)

You would expect this place to be experts at what they offer but unfortunately, a lot of the so-called Singapore food is simply forgettable, even the nasi lemak with its cold, limp friend chicken and not so fragrant rice. One thing you will notice is that most of the wait staff are Filipinos (no offense) but they should find out more about the food that they are serving before attempting to work there.Perhaps their cakes on offer would have been a wiser option

Simply love the ambience and old time feeling with chalk and black board. The order of food is done interestingly with marker and white board. While waiting for the food, one can indulge in chldhood games such as five stones, snake and ladder and etc.My Top Picks are:1) Mee Siam with sauce of right richness and special tastes of combined spicy, sour and tinge of sweetness.2) Butter and banana cakes are not too sweet but have yummy old time flavours and are worth trying.3) Chendol is refreshing with the rich freshness of coconut taste, topped with thick slimy chendol pieces. Only hope for the red beans to be bigger.Although the prices are considered high for hawker food, the quality of food continues to attract repeated customers. Just an important note: closed on Monday and opens only from 12pm

Love the feelings of being back in primary school class settings. Had- Kueh Peiti- Mee Siam- Hor Fun- Nasi brayani- Otah Otah- OSD signature Putut - Tuckshop Wings- Home style curry chicken- Chendol- Food are fresh and above average (probably I am famish) but chendol is horrible, ice shavings were frozen therefore liquified tastelessly & worst off, coconut were not fresh & even though Gula Melaka were tasty it couldn't save the day

Totally love OSD for their friendly staff (Cindy always has a huge warm smile!) and nice ambience, not forgetting their food of course. Try the laksa and mee siam with extra sambal, and cool off with a iced milo, do note that they serve local food at cafe prices, so don't grumble at the cost because part of it goes to social causes

I am a frequent customer of Old School Delights (OSD) since it opened. The manager Cindy and her team are helpful and run the place well. As for food, some items stand out which are my personal favourites: Tuckshop wings with the delicious chilli mayo sauce, the Chicken Bryani, laksa, barley-lime juice and the yummy Aunty Gaya's Banana Cake and Lemony Cake. Overall quite value for money, especially if you like local Singaporean food

Brought back good memories about Singapore eateries of old. The cake is fantastic. Prices are very reasonable. Recommended for gatherings with friends too.

Just had dinner there with my family. Food was good. Ambience was great! Great place to chill on a lazy Sunday. A tad pricey but will definitely come again!

I usually come here once a month and really like the quality of food. Nice knick knacks to purchase reminding me of the old Singapore. Service is also good. Would recommend.

nostalgic theme, interesting place. Can see lot of efforts have been put into a lot of details in doing up the place. Sees old-time children story books, such as Enid Blyton, old time games such as snake and ladders, five stones, etc. It's a fun place to be in. Food wise, not too big a menu. Decent standard although not outstanding

We ordered the mushroom based Hor Fun and Laksa. Laksa comes in a smooth gravy. Not particularly exciting to the tastebud. My wife didn't quite enjoy this meal. I ordered the Hor Fun. It's actually Ipoh Hor Fun. The gravy has a very strong mushroom taste and is thick. I like this a lot. However, the rice noodles (hor fun) is too thin and made the entire dish too smooth and doesn't quite have a bite in it. Too smooth for my liking. Felt like I was having a soft diet.The ambience and dÃ©cor is very nice though. A lot of old days paraphernalias. Staff were friendly too. Only waited 10mins for the dishes to arrive

very diverse menu for the asian palate http://www.oldschooldelights.com/love their nasi lemak and finger foodeverything is a little on the pricey side though and if u sit outside the seating area is so near the car park and main road that u inhale alot of exhaust or cigarette smoke whilst eating. sitting inside also gives your clothes an oil stench =( but it's comfort food. delicious chicken wings and chendol
4
I am a regular at this joint as it's near to my place. There are many cafes around my area but this is a 'go-to' place as it has a nice ambience (can be a bit noisy though) and nice food (nasi lemak, chicken wings and chendol are my usual choices)
5
Food is good and served very fast. I love their nasi bryani.The service is always very good and there is a lady at the counter (don't know her name) who is always extremely friendly and helpful. I often go there with my wife and 2 boys and we are always well taken care of in a genuine and simple way. Thank you for that! Would recommend

Felt like going there for lunch in my school uniform! We love the snacks sold in a provision shop style, which reminded us of our childhood. Besides that, this place is great for good local food like laksa and mee siam. We really like the heart-warming theme of old school

Visited this restuarant for many times and it never fail to bring back some memories. Local dishes like Mee Siam, Nasi Lemak and Bryani is good but somehow I felt it lack some consistency. The chocolate fudge cake is a must try dessert. This is a place worth a visit especially for those born during the 60s and 70s. A good place to tell your stories to your children or even grand children
