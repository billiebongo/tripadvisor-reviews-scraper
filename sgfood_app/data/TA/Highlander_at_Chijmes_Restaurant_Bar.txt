Great friends, great food, great location and a pleasure to be at to relax and unwind. Used to work down here at the Jump but what a transformation Well done all.

Maybe nice if more people, but certainly not if you have only a few tables occupied.
The waiter literally overlooks the drink from your glass to take it away immediately when empty!

I was looking for a decent live band to unwind with good ambience. Highlander has a cosy ambience with nice setup. The 4 piece band local appears to be talented, the disappointment was the song choices where most of them I can't really relate to. The Martini was a pleasant drink, which was the first time I decide to try with no regrets
3
Service - Quite attentive but even though its only half full, I think they had their hands full. I had to patiently wait a few minutes to flag their service staff. They forgot our order of B52 after happy hour.Price - We were there during happy hour and tried their car bomb, highlander ale and lost in edinburg.Car bomb was really a bomb, my friend didnt feel much alcoholic content inside. My lost in edinbury had an overpowering lime juice taste and also didnt give much kick. Appears to be drinking mocktails lolx. Highlander ale is light and tasty.Location- Basement 1 of chijmesValue - Theres a live band as well.Price - Less than forty dollars for three drinks, during happy hour. So double it if you are there after happy hours

I went for drinks here after dinner and was smacked with a $180 bill after only a few drinks. After asking for a vodka/coke (which would usually be house pour) upon checking the bill, we were given Grey Goose without asking for it. Lesson here is to always specify which spirit or they WILL take advantage
4
We headed here after dinner at another restaurant at Chijmes because we heard the band & thought to hear them for a while. This was on a Friday night. We were shown to a table immediately and the service was good. It was quite full at the time we went but seem to empty out closer to midnight.. maybe the working crowd hit the bars and went home. We were there as tourists. The band was good to listen to with some of out old time favourites being played. Good service for drinks

Highlander at Chijmes has its own attraction compared to its twin at Clarke Quay. The setting here is more relaxed and is aimed more at a good dining experience with great music. The main attraction here is the tasty food and a superb live band. One can choose to sit either indoors to catch the music or one can choose the outdoor tables for some al fresco dining and conversation. The staff here is also helpful and friendly

I had reserved a table for 2 indoors, but was given a table outdoors when I arrived. As it began to rain, I requested to be shifted inside and they managed to find a table for me.Waited quite long for the food to arrive as it was Valentine's Day. We were supposed to have 2 warm chocolate puddings but only 1 arrived initially and we had to wait a while before the next arrived. We saw other customers complaining too, but at least the food quality was good. We liked the grilled chicken breast and the warm chocolate pudding was fantastic! It cost $88+ per couple for our Valentine's Day dinner

This was the second time visiting Highlander at Chijmes. We had the Valentine's Day Couple 3-Course Set Menu that came with 2 glasses of Moscato.We tried different starters - Prawn Cocktail, and Grilled Portobello and Poached Egg. The prawn cocktail was rather average, but the portobello was pretty good.We had the Guiness Beef Pie and Grilled Chicken Breast for our mains. The chicken was alright, but the Beef Pie was delicious. Generous portions of beef in tasty gravy. The pastry on the pie was nice as well.For dessert, we had the Cranachan and the Warm Chocolate Pudding. The cranachan was average, but we really liked the chocolate pudding which came warm and tasted really rich.We also had 2 beers which was going at 50% off during happy hour. Overall, we had a pleasant experience there, and I felt that it was quite value for money. Would visit again
5
Alone the atmosphere of Chijmes is something special. The Highlander is one of the bars and restaurants in the lower level. There is seating inside and outside. The staff go round wearing kilts, paired with black kneehigh socks. Service was fast and friendly, on a quiet night. I had seen this place much more packed a few nights earlier, but we chose a quite night for our drinks there
4
Met friends for a drink and happened to be happy hour so great cocktails at a great price also ended up staying for dinner which was good mainly western food but good value and good size portions.
Will definitely go back again
5
Good place to enjoy Scottish food with Scottish ale. I think every dish is little up-sized so ask the staff before placing any order. Swift and kind staff.
5
Higerlander ale is much better at chijmes than the outlet at CQ. Plenty of tapas to try from !! Do check it out from the friendly staffs or managers for more promotions. Excellent service and great deals!
5
Great job on the amount of effort made to the decorations (halloween). The happy hour and TGIW promo is very money-value. Sizzling prawn is yummy!

Our regular sushi place was closed for Chinese New Years so we dropped into Highlander for a bite. Kids loved the $2 sliders (available before 6pm) which also saved me from having to buy the $28 burger. I had the steak and Guinness pie. This was a first for me, so nothing to compare it to, but I found it really tasty with tender chunks of steak, carrots and potato in a tasty Guinness stew. We had the red velvet cheesecake and cherry pie for dessert. All in all a tasty meal and we'll definitely be back. They have a good happy hour as well.
4
Stopped for a quick snack and drink! Ended up having 3 drinks and more substantial food. Choice of food is mainly western style but decent prices and good quality . Happy hour great value as all drinks 50% off until 8pm and cocktails actually taste like cocktails not a watered down version. Would definitely go again.
4
My Wife and I went for dinner on New Year's Eve and had a fantastic meal, my Wife a sirloin and I had to have the haggis pie !!! I had a couple of pints of Scottish lager lol not sure if it was but it was good certainly not tenants lol we then sat outside to watch the world go by with a further few drinks .... excellent place for relaxing and great food
4
The food was delicious, value for money, the location was good and we had privacy. I wish the smoking area was minimised and away from the non smoking area because we were with babies and passive smoking was annoying..The service can be improved a little..Overall i like this place ..very cosy and relaxed with good food...will be back agai
3
We went for our night out with another couple, had the mixed platter n spaghetti to share with other entre. I had a beer while the others had margarita. Food was decent but the staff was rather lacking; we had to ask for things before we could get them...like round of ice water n sauces to go with the mixed platter, etc. They ought to serve mint jelly/sauce if there're lamb chops in the platter!! However they were very anxious in wanting to clear our plates/glasses even when we haven't completely finished. Rather irritating
3
We ordered the platter meant for 4 which came with free Cocktails. The platter was ok but the Bloody Mary that came with it was horrible. Our server was really nice and friendly but that we the only consolation. Maybe if you are here for drinks/happy hour, the experience may be better
4
Wasn't very crowded and the service considered as moderate. The steak was fine but not succulent. The side dish (fries) was really good!
4
Very nice location. service was little slow but it was early diner hour. Ordered hamburger and was surprised by the size. Very tasty and done per my instructions.
good place to have quick bite and few beers
4
Was a very surprise this restaurant for me. Very good environment, with a very nice and confortable design. The food is really goof moreover the salmon and you can enjoy his own Scottish beer. It is nice to see the waiters drressed by scotthish skirts!!!
5
We visited the Chijmes and randomly choose this place for the fantastic happy hour offers, but we're really impressed. Attentive service, delicious food and a great choice of drinks. Everything having a Scottish twist down to the staff wearing kilts. Enjoyed it so much we came back the second night with our kids and the staff were fantastic with them - making them laugh. We were seated outside both time and were very happy with everything. Will definitely be back again when we come back to Singapore

Hadn't been to Chijmes in years and stumbled across Highlander while looking for a place to have a drink on a Saturday evening. Happy Hour ran until 9pm and it was 50% off all beers, wines and cocktails. Not a huge cocktail list, but decent enough and at 50% off was more than happy to imbibe, given the typical cost of drinks in Singapore. We sat inside initially as it was still quite warm out. Inside is all high table seating, which was a bit odd but a decent enough layout. There was a stage for a band as well, though we didn't stay late enough to hear the music. We moved outside later in the evening; the outside seating area was typical tables/dining area with normal seating. Once the air had cooled a bit it was quite nice. The only food we tried was the cherry pie, which was decent enough and topped with vanilla ice cream. Good mix of martinis and the waiter made a few for us which were off menu. My Wife really enjoyed a drink called Lost in Edinburgh, which was from their single malt cocktail list. Will definitely be back again for happy hour.

I would recommend their steak, we had rib eye and it is cooked to our liking. Happy hour till 9pm was great for people that love to have a drink. We had red wine, white white and beer. Tried their cherry pie and i would give it a thumb up but not their red velvet cake, sorry
4
Highlander does good 50% off happy hour on beers. The atmosphere inside is a little strange - seating layout is a little awkward, but outside is fine if it is not too hot. The whisky prawns entree is quite nice and so is the lamb main. The staff are all dressed in Scottish skilts which adds to the atmosphere. I would definitely go bac

I was there with a couple of friends, we were an international group: German, Australian and Singaporean. The vibe of the bar was cool which is why we went in, but as soon as we sat down we commented to each other: why is your bar trying to give us a dark Berlin underground club vibe with antlers on the wall etc and Pan's labyrinth type paintings and you are playing S Club 7? Live band looked dead, music was fluffy American pop that added no charisma whatsoever to the atmosphere, bar was half empty but servers looked bored and slapped the bill on our table so suddenly we thought they were dying for us to leave. Perhaps because of how the bar looked and being spoilt on German or Australian underground bars with drinks that should only cost 3 or 4 Euros with industrial DJs we think that this is bad, very bad

A hidden find in the rather upclass Chijmes, one would expect an evening here to rake up a three digit bill. Not at Highlander, which runs a daily happy hour with half price off their extensive drinks menu until 9pm (yes - even on weekends)!We liked their classics. The Singapore Sling ($15.80 before 50% off) was a citrusy concoction with the right amount of liquor. The peanut butter chocolate martini ($15.80 before discount) garnered mixed reviews; an acquired taste that grows on you with each sip. Wash that all down with a sugary peach margarita ($15.80) and you're all set for the night.We like that they don't scrip on portions despite the affordable prices, each drink comes in a sizable glass. My guess is that by your third drink, you'll be ready to hit the dance floor.They're currently running a promotion with $2 beef sliders before 7pm daily. These are no wagyu patties, but make for good bar snacks nonetheless.The only thing we didn't like was the slow service and pouty-mouth waiters. Otherwise, definitely recommend Highlander for its very value-for-money drinks
4
We had pre-dinner cocktails here and were pleasantly surprised that they had 2 for 1 single malt happy hour- decent selection but what surprised us was their $SGD 1 sliders.. great deal- great atmosphere- Of course Singapore weather and single malt do not mix well so we had nice ice cold beers after the first dram... All good
3
Like this spot for evening drinks. Inside the Chijmes complex on the lower level. Nice alfresco drinks spot, very pleasant in the evening. Good for drinks, just that service is a bit slow.
4
We has a good time here. The drinks are however pricey. The outside sitting is very comfortable and we had a great time.
5
We had an enjoyable dinner here during our visit to Singapore. Food portions were adequate and drinks strong. We found the staff to be pleasant and efficient also.

Was extremely disappointed with the hospitality card privileges, I was issued with the hospitality card due to my job and bringing the rest of my friends who are working in the same industries to enjoy the deal. During settlement, card was presented with business card and with employee card and “the server” mentioning these privileges only applicable to one Xxx Company only. This was not communicating earlier when I got the card. 1st night we spend around $800 with no issue and 2nd night we spend around $200 with so many issues
4
We ate here, food was good, nothing amazing, but good. Wine like everywhere in Singapore is expensive but we happened to, unintentionally, arrive for happy hour, so it really worked out quite reasonable. Staff were nice and friendly. Not sure the kilts are a necessity in the heat!!!!
5
Visited with 2 other people while on a business trip, not during Happy Hour.Sat indoors and ordered the Shepherd's Pie, which was one of the best I ever ate, and an Illusion cocktail, which no words can describe how good it was!The place itself is fun, big, has live shows (though their sound is a bit too loud) and quite a kind service.Not the cheapest but definitely worth the price, which isn't too bad either
5
Off the record, the lady at the bar taps - sweet face. Just the face. I'm guilty of a few glances.I love their $2 mini burgers. It's mini, so challenge yourself to finish it in 1 mouth. Juicy. In the event of a choke, down more Ale. I like how competitive the pubs are as they battle it out with their happy hour specials.Here u get more seating, which means more human traffic too. As u approach the evening post 6pm, it gets more crowded on the weekend. Enjoy nonetheles
5
We visited during happy hourThe drinks were half price which is a much better deal than 2 for 1 if you only want an odd number of drinksThey have a boutique draft beer which I enjoyedMy wife enjoyed her Sauvignon Blanc Good serviceFriendly staff with tartan skirts & kilt

I had dinner hear with a few others during recent visit to Singapore. Service was friendly and fast. Food was good with a wide selection. Good happy hour including one for one whiskeys. If you like whisky they have a huge election available. Located at Chimes opposite raffles Place.Indoor and outdoor dining
1
Business meet up at the bar. Ordered from the menu Yamazaki 12 years 2 glasses, should be around SGD 12 per glass....But when the bill came, it was more than double charged to us and I queried why. They said they gave us the Yamazaki 21 years instead by mistake so this is the price.I told him I ordered 12 years and nobody was saying the one you gave me was 21 years before you charge me that? Then they tried to make excuses saying they were out of 12 years etc... Excuses or lies, your choice.Anyway, we insisted that, either they told us upfront they don't have 12 years, so we can decide. Not that to force you to pay for sth you didn't ordered. Be aware or avoid
3
Nice enough decor sitting outside. Staff a little slow getting to us. When ordering a beer, three on the list were not available and they were the Scottish ones I wanted.
Chicken breast was over cooked and meal lacked a nice vegetable.
4
Went here the service was welcoming and friendly. I had the fish and chips with curry mayonnaise which was lovely. There was a live band playing who were great
Nice place to go
5
Great location, nice to sit outside, friendly staff, good drink menu and reasonable prices. Great place for large groups of friends to meet
4
Unlike their other outlet at Clarke Quay, Highlander at Chijmes has amazing service! Interesting drinks and food! The live bands are amazing! Do check out their happy hour deals! Favourite place to hang out at the moment!
5
Alcohol were at 50% discount till 9 or 10pm. The cocktails all were excellent. Staffs are friendly. There are 2 group of live bands. Been there twice for drinks and definitely will come back again.

Went here on a Saturday night between 10 and midnight. Music was poor and the place was empty except a few locals. No one was eatin
4
This themed restaurant/Bar is set in the centre of the Chijmes district among some 20 food and drink outlets. SO, the general atmosphere is one of 'holiday-Buzzy'.I brought a Party of 20 here post a works conference. We enjoyed great, attentive service from the Manager and staff and on that particular evening there was a Live band to entertain us.(the musicians were from the Phillipines and were very talented) All these ingredients made for a superb evening of fun and joviality and we all really enjoyed ourselves
4
Although pricey, but then again that whole area is the same, I've enjoyed coming to this place a number of times. Staff are good, restaurant has nice set up and the whole area has a decent ambiance. There are some decent specials and the food is surprisingly good

Having been unwell, got a craving for there highlander chicken. Both my friend and I ordered the same, when I was half way through mine my friend pointed out her chicken was completely uncooked, when I checked mine was the same. When i got the bill, I pointed this out to the waiter who took the bill away and applied a 10% discount, no apologies or anything. I wasn't looking for a discount, I would have appreciated them recognising they were supplying food that could result in serious food poisoning. When I then asked a waitress to make sure she informed the chef, she laughed and walked away. Stay clear.
5
We went here while wandering around near our hotel The fairmont, there was a band playing pretty good tunes. The staff were busy but friendly and were very cheery when taking our order, we both had the fillet steak, which was fabulous, if we had been in Singapore longer we would have gone back again! The staff are in kilts, which adds to the fun/ highlander element. Lots of people all ages dining here very enjoyable experience/meal
