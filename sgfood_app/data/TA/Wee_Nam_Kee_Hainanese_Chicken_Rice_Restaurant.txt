Good food, singapore hainan chicken rice is a must try whenever visiting singapore, great food at cheap prices.

Pretty crowded restaurant. We arrived at 8pm and still had to wait. Ordered 2 different kinds of chicken - the steamed one and the roasted one and they were both delicious. My friend ordered some chicken stockings for $1 or so..
3
Overall standard has dropped but queue is still as Long.. expect 10-15 minutes waiting time at Marina Square. Especially the soup of the day, Black Bean Soup, $6 pales in taste and ingredients.

Asked hotel concierge about finding a popular dish for Singapore. She recommended this chicken rice restaurant. My wife had steamed chicken and I had roasted. It included a bowl of flavorful broth. One odd thing, they don’t provide a napkin. The was a towelette delivered to the table which they charged .20 for. The also charged for a glass of water. Don’t let these items keep you from trying this restaurant or the chicken rice

Tourists beware - if you have only a few days in Singapore and wish to try the famous chicken rice, this place is NOT it.The chicken is tough and dry and overpriced. They attempt to mask the poor quality of the chicken with lots of soya sauce. The other dishes - beef, vegetables, pork ribs are overpriced as well with very small quantity for that price. The mixed vegetables in particular was doused with a lot of starch in the gravy to thicken the dish with a measly portion of actual veg. The beef with ginger was overcooked and in small portions.Soup was essentially water with MSG in it and not the proper double boiled soup served in other Chinese restaurants. It appeared that they are cutting corners on the food quality and portions while still pricing it at the typical chicken rice restaurant prices. The worse thing about this place is the service staff. They are curt and arrogant. We were shouted at to wait for our food by a bossy fat woman in a yellow apron and black spectacles, when we asked to check on our order after 40 Min, and while the patrons that came after us were served their full meal. When we asked for our drinks to be served to us at least, she brought us our drinks and placed them on our table with a loud bang and cursed at us loudly in Mandarin. Shocked at her attitude we beckoned the manager who looked afraid to get involved and signaled to us repeatedly to engage that staff for anything we needed. Just as we intended to walk out, the food appeared and the plates were literally handed to us by the kitchen staff at our eye level as they did not bother to bend over to place it on our table for us. Atrocious service from this place. You would do better trying the food at the food court next door. At least you would be paying for what you get, without paying the additional service tax for abysmal service. Tourists - do try the chicken rice at a real hawker centre instead of this makeshift restaurant.

My buddy introduced me & family to this authentic Hainanese chicken rice in Marina Square. We all just love it! The steamed and soya sauced chicken are delicious. We went back there for second time and it was great!Must try this outlet if you're looking for nice authentic Hainanese chicken rice!Keep up the good taste

Somehow, the famous chains of chicken rice restaurants like Wee Nam Kee and Boon Tong Kee have not been upholding the quality of chicken rice in Singapore.For a plate of chicken rice averaging >$7, one does not get tasty or fragrant chicken meat. The chilly is also not up to par...so paying so much just for the rice isn't quite worth it
4
I'd say it's a hidden gem amongst the tonnes of eateries in Marina Square. It's tucked away on the top floor of the mall on the same floor as the massive food court. The restaurant is always churning out the same delicious quality of chicken rice every time I visit regardless of the long queues that snake down to the mouth of the escalator.My hot button with chicken rice is the flavour of the rice itself. If the rice isn't tasty to eat it on its own, then it's not good chicken rice. As for Wee Nam Kee, I can definitely eat the rice on its own and do can my colleagues. The chicken is of decent portion - unlike other stores where there's more bone than meat - and the price does not poke a hole in your wallet. Even if you were to dine by yourself, a simple plate of chicken rice comes to less than SGD5.00. Worth it

I was attracted by recensions for this restaurant, but i first of all had difficulties to find it, because it was inside the commercial centre, and local people did not know it. When finally found and taken table, I have been disappointed for the service. The waitress was requested to explain different dishes and suggest me, but she was a piece of ice and her english was very bad. At the end i ordered what i already knew.....and luckly the quality was good
4
Thanks to the recommendation of the concierge at our hotel. My wife and myself had a taste of the famous Singapore dish chicken rice. Was introduced few local home-cooked dishes as well.Although the waiters and waitresses seem to be struggling to explain the ingredients used in our dishes, we seriously appreciated that a lady uses google translate to explain to us in English. Service could be better
4
Good chicken rice for reasonable price. Can be a bit of wait through out the day but line moves pretty fast.
5
Celebrated my girlfriend's birthday here. Though this is not a usual "date" place, it can satisfy big appetite for chili crab and cereal prawn.
5
Every time we stop by Singapore, we usually stay at the Conrad, and walk over to the mall and have lunch at Wee Nam Kee. The place serves good chicken rice for a cheap, cheap price!
4
Came here for a late lunch on a weekend. Was still relatively full so had to wait just an bit for a table. Service was quick and attentive. Had the steamed chicken (e.g. Chicken rice; chicken was tender as it should be), the salted egg prawns (which were really good) and braised tofu and vegetables (excellent as well). If you want reasonably priced local Chinese food, this is one place you should visit.
5
Have been to this establishment several times and having tried many other chicken rice stalls/restaurants, we seem to gravitate to Wee Nam Kee as our go to place each time we visit Singapore.This is a busy little restaurant on the same floor as the food court. Because it is a stand alone restaurant, you cannot order food from the outside stalls.There is usually a 15-20 minute wait to get a table and it was no different the evening we visited.Apart from chicken rice, they also cook a variety of other dishes but the chicken is the stand out dish.If you want to try great chicken rice in Singapore, I highly recommend this restaurant

Fragrant chicken rice and tender chicken. Surprise to find the stir fried crab was beautifully done. The chefs are definitely versatile and very experienced. I come here one a week and it's my Neighbourhood kitchen. However can get quite crowded. Sometime I have wait for quite a while even for a take out. Food runs out fast as well especially the livers. A definite try
4
I wanted to eat chicken rice and found this shop in Marina Square. It was not too crowded and the waitresses helped me to find a table. I ordered roasted chicken drumstick with rice. The chicken is juicy but with some blood, depending whether you are ok to see some blood on the bones or not. Overall the chicken rice was good and at reasonable price
3
Came here for good cheap eats. The service and restaurant environment are great, but was disappointed when I tasted the cold chicken. The soup and rice are tasty. I actually had to dump the chicken pieces in the soup to warm them up before putting them in my mouth. Great place for hanging out with friends and family. Hopefully they can make sure the chicken meats are warm before they serve (possibly because I was going there for dinner so the chicken are already cooled hanging in the air for the whole day. Given the rave reviews they receive over their chicken rice, the food shouldn't be served cold). I also love their hot barley, tastes great (authentic) and not too sweet. If the chicken is not served cold, their chili and minced ginger would make the food tastes great
5
This outlet in Northpoint has just opened for business. I had the roast chicken rice which cost me $4.80. The chicken is soft and tender and the skin lightly crisp. I love the fragrant soft rice which has a light brown colour to it. There was a small container of chilli sauce that comes with the rice but I would also like some minced ginger - it was not given. Only for those dine-in customers. It was crowded even on weekdays so be prepared to wait and queue for your turn
5
Food is always consistent . Chicken juicy and succulent . Rice is always fragrant and I always help myself to another serving . You can get more soup for free , so I suggest not to buy any other soup . Great work and well done !
4
I went with some friends to Wee Nam Kee and we shared roasted chicken, sweet and sour pork, chicken livers, vegetables and more. The rice was very tasty, all the food was very good. Chili sauce was hot and flavorful.
4
The Hainanese Chicken Rice at Wee Nam Kee very tasty and the i like the roasted chicken. For sure one is not enough..
5
For tourists visiting Singapore, this is one of the must go places to have your plate of the famous Chicken Rice. The price is very reasonable and many locals actually visit this restaurant as well. Highly recommended and prices are very friendly as well!
5
I had my doubts when I see the place. It looked like a regular Chinese food eatery, plus it's just chicken rice. How good can it be? When I tasted the their specialty chicken rice, I totally understood the suggestions about this place from my friends and family. The chicken was perfectly cooked and succulent, the juice dripping from the skin was enough to act as the condiment and nothing else. There were other dishes that I ordered such as the roast pork belly and stir fry kale, which all were great, but the chicken rice easily top the chart. I took my friends there whenever they visited Singapore ever since and they all loved it as well
4
Yummiest chicken rice in town! Well, we visited the one in Novena area. We ordered steamed chicken, hainanese rice, cha siu, dumpling soup and veggie. My most favorite dish is the chicken rice. You need to queue to get your table though. Although it looked like a verrrry long queue but the staffs were efficient and fast! We got our table less than 30 minutes. Worth try wait and try
5
I loved the prawns with cereal. Very tasty. Service was okay. I did not have any problems with anything about the service. The place was full but lucky enough to be seated quickly as there was 1 table available. Service staff asked if I needed rice with my prawns, a good cue for customer info. Otherwise i would have waited again for an order of rice had I were not asked. This place will be in our list of resto to go to every visit to Singapore from now on.
2
There are many dangerous effects of having bad customer service and its sad to see that they are highly praised for their humble reputation on their website and Facebook. This is my 2nd time observing a boss-like staff exerting *his & her* power over a junior staff by raising their voice and pin-pointing their mistakes openly. This is extremely embarrassing, intimidating and unprofessional. Indeed "It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it". Food is average. Roasted chicken is dry and no longer tender as compared to the past. Chicken rice was too moist and no fragrance.We tried the Wee Nam Kee pork chop as well. Miserable portion for a (L) size. Salad dough fritters was hard and chewy.Definitely not the best Hainanese Chicken Rice stall around
5
They have a few outlets but I always go to the Novena branch (cause it's air conditioned and it's somewhat in The Central). I like the roasted chicken rice and fried you tiao (with squid paste inside)! The prices are really affordable! No service charge! But they do charge you for the wet tissue (0.20 cents for one).
3
I'm still not sure why everyone seems to think that Chicken Rice is any big deal. We thought this dish was really going to be something special so we went to this restaurant inside the Suntec Mall in the food court. What we got was one plate with sliced chicken breast on it and another plate with white rice on it. No secret sauce or anything special. The dish is pretty ordinary in my opinio
5
I came at 2pm, public holiday with my wife and 2 kids. I read a few negative feedback about their service. I am a tourist myself and I did not find anything wrong about how they treat people. Some tourist need to understand that this restaurant is busy and this is singapore where it is common people talk to you directly with their singlish which may sound "different" to some people from other part of the world. I like this restaurant it represent Singapore style Hainanese Chicken Rice and the Porks as well as the squid, when I was there, the service was decent. As a matter of fact it was slightly above average than the other typical restaurantI am happy to give them 5 star
5
This is more or less like boon tong kee . I miss their bbq pork which my friend told me very good. Will be back to try that
5
We came here to try their chicken over rice before boarding our cruise ship and we were not disappointed. The chicken was smooth, tasty and not dry. Add the condiments of a little soy sauce, ginger & garlic and a little chili sauce plus the coconut flavored rice, you got one heck of a meal. The place was relatively crowded as locals also frequent this place so you know it's pretty good. And to top it all, you do not have to dine in the dreadful Singaporean heat as this place is air conditioned so you could eat in relative comfort. If you like Hainanese chicken, this is the place
1
We made do w a table for 4 for 8 of us. There were some unhappiness but what takes the cake is that there was a table for 6 with 2 adults only n the guy who brought us to the table blamed us for not making a reservation??!!
1
Staff is rude, extremely racist and disgusting. I was welcomed in with a hostile look and a Yes? Menu was thrown on my table, food was thrown on my table. Looking at the pictures here on trip advisor of the same dish i ordered, i can see that i also got a much, much smaller portion + the food was Luke warm. What a sick, disgusting type of people run this place. It is truly worrying that such people even exist on this globe. Don't go here unless you are Chinese. Most certainly don't go here if you are black.
5
Totally have enough with chicken rice since I brought my family over & over again to boon tong kee until we tried wee nam kee. The flavor is refreshing! The chicken is very tender, roasted skin is light & crispy, soy sauce is well balance between savory & sweet and garlic chili is perfecting the whole dish. They have white or roasted chicken rice, personal set or half / whole chicken and also other chinese food menu. Price is affordable, portion is ok too. Avoid meal times if possible or prepare to queue
5
This is our first meal when we just arrived in Singapore. I love chicken so much. Therefore I chose this one without any second wondering. Chicken was so fresh and tender which combine perfectly with soya sauce. The soup was great with nice broth. Strongly recommend this place. Very clean, nice staff, excellent services
4
My partner and I are from New York City and came here to sample what we were told was great Hainanese chicken. We both loved the roasted and soy sauce versions it the chicken and the dark sauce was amazing. The restaurant is simple, clean, bright and bustling and the food was great and a great value. I wish we had this type of food available in New York. I would eat it every day
4
The restaurant is conveniently located on the 4th level of the Marina Square It is always very crowded during lunch and I always make it a point to be there early. The Chicken rice is consistently very good. They have a very reasonable set for lunch which is comparable to food court prices. Very good value for money and service is both friendly and fast. Every time when there are overseas visitors that craved for chicken rice, this is the place I will bring them to
5
One of my highlights to Singapore was to eat the Hainanese chicken rice. My wife loved it tremendously. The boiled white or dark soy sauce chicken meat is so tender and juicy. The rice is cooked in its juices and so fragrant. The ginger and chili paste is to die for if you care for the hot stuff. We ordered half a chicken for the 4 of us plus you can order other Chinese Cantonese dishes like vegetables or pork/beef. Ask them for recommendations

Visited the United Square branch in November 2016 to try out this infamous chicken rice. I did not find the white chicken to be anything fantastic. The ones I had in Boon Tong Kee and a restaurant next to Raffles Hotel were more exciting to eat.Soup was not bad. Service was a little slow, with incoming patrons hardly noticeable hidden behind a feature wall near the entrance. Waiters were not very friendly, they were focused more on delivering orders quickly..
2
Alas, the kitchen has declined and they've become lazy enough to use MSG for the chicken soup. Simply unacceptable. The chicken is tender but the accompanying sauce has lost its aroma, being overwhelmed by saltiness.
4
The food is excellent and there are quite varieties not only chicken rice. However, the chicken rice is great. Also the other vegetable dishes are also fantastic. The services are okay as a whole.
5
After a meeting near United Square in Novena I found Wee Nam Kee and decided to give it a try.
The chicken was tender and juicy and the rice was just great. It's excellent value for the quality of the food.
Highly recommend!
4
Very inexpensive, casual restaurant. Service was very friendly and food great. Quick service. Frequented by mostly locals, which is always a good sign. Their chicken rice was delicious.
3
Wee Nam Kee has been around since 1989, and is currently situated in an air-conditioned eatery at United Square. Their specialty is chicken rice. The white chicken which we ordered was flavourful but a little fat. The rice was a little too moist. We also ordered several other dishes like fish head curry, baby kailan (a green leafy veg), hot plate tofu and some chicken giblets. The standard of cooking of ok for an average Chinese cooked food store (as opposed to a Chinese restaurant), but then again nothing really special. One of the most important components of good chicken rice is the chilli sauce. The sauce served here was traditional but lacked oomph. The wait staff seemed to be mainly mainland Chinese, so communications might be an issue for non-Chinese speakers, although the manager is a local and very friendly. Queue management was somewhat chaotic that evening, seeing that they don't take reservations and have a very basic queue line in which at least 1 family cut the queue.Having said the above, the place continues to be very popular with locals and tourists alike. But there are far better places out there serving great chicken rice without all the other main course add ons.
3
Been to this place a few times and the chicken rice is nice with a variety of chicken - steamed, roasted or braised in soya sauce. The curry fish head is pretty good too. Come for the food but the service is pretty bad. Not sure where they find the waitresses from but there's this one who shows her bad attitude and it definitely sucks. If this was a cheap and nasty place then I wouldn't have mind putting up with chappy service. But the prices do not reflect a cheap and nasty place and therefore something needs to change. Perhaps that's why it isn't as busy as it used to be during lunch hour.
4
A thumbs up to their hainanese chicken rice. My daughter loves it and my son love their rice. He only ate the rice and almost finished two order of it. The stir fried beef is also good. The assorted veggies is also good. You can also order fresh coconut juice. The overall experience is thumbs up.
5
Tender chicken with light tasty sauce, it goes super well with fragrant chicken rice. Whether you order white chicken or roasted chicken, even once I ordered all chicken breasts, they still taste very delicious! Most people go for their rice, some people will order noodle it also serve with the famous chicken. I like their wanton type noodle too. They serve home-made chili paste, and ginger paste for you to serve with the chicken as you like. Fresh food, fast service, reasonable price. Must try
5
My review is for the United Sq branch. People have mentioned that the other chicken rice shops along Balestier Road are the best. But for me personally Wee Nam Kee is the best. The chicken meat is succulent and juicy. The rice and soup are tasty. They provide ginger paste that adds flavour to the rice. Overall, the best chix rice for me.
4
Ate lunch here. Chicken and chilli and a beef dish with seafood fried rice. All tasted good. With 2 glasses of water and 1 coke came to $31. They put disposable hand towels on table - if you use them there is a charge 9 not much) and tap water is 30 cents a glass.Service quick and busy cafe with lots of locals eating in it
3
Normal place, meat is tasty, breast meat is tough. Rice is nice and fragrant ... Chilli is below average. Can try if you are around here.
2
Read the reviews and thought to try it out. Unfortunately the service was poor, and the steamed chicken was no better then what you can get for lower price.
Saving grace was the rice, which was fragrant enough.
Prices was relatively expensive.
5
We were looking for a spot have an early lunch. We ordered the staple chicken rice and were very pleased with the dish. Would recommend.
5
my colleague, who worked in Singapore for a couple of years highly recommend this restaurant to me. So i spent a lunch there, and i never regrat to get there. the fragance rice is so good to eat, you never need other food to eat with. the chicken is tender and juicy too. highly recommended.
4
Were not aware that this restaurant had good TA reviews. It was quiet in the early morning we were roaming Marina Square looking for a place for breakfast so decided to give it a try. Turned out to be very good. We all enjoyed the tasty chicken rice, served hot with chicken broth and made tastier with the home made chilli sauce. Reasonably priced, good value. Later on when we passed the restaurant, it was full
4
Brought an overseas friend here as it was famous and she wanted to try it. The chicken was good but the rice was only passable. Could probably get the same quality at a cheaper price at hawker centres. But good to bring overseas visitors here as the ambience was much better than hawker centres.
5
We tried Tian Tian chicken rice after finding it on tripadvisor and thought it was good. However we wanted to try another chicken rice and the Mandarin Oriental hotel doorman recommended Wee Nam Kee. The chicken rice was much nicer than Tian Tian and it served it with the ginger sauce as well as the chilli sauce, and less time waiting as the owners were very efficient in seating people, the rice was very flavoursome and the chicken was so tender. We ate here a few times as it was so good. The price was the same as Tian Tian
3
It was really crowded in the evening when we went to have dinner. I made a reservations beforehand but was given a seat that was near the wall/pillar and I had a hard time moving my seat. The tables could not be moved and I was literally 'stuck'. The table was so dirty, as when I was trying to move the table to a comfortable distance, I had my hands all dirtied with soy sauce underneath the table. Still, the table could not be moved. Table for 2 pax but our seats were so near other people that we could hear every conversation. I did not have much appetite after the experience and we take-away our food instead. The fish soup noodles was nice, however the crab fried rice was a little dry. Soup of the day was really refreshing, however a bit pricey for a small bowl of soup
5
Chicken rice is a must, it solves hang overs, it keeps families happy, great food before you travel, tasty and big portions. I have never had a bad meal at United Square or when they were on Thomson road. This restaurant is onto a winning formula. We always order the same dishes and there is never anything left on the plates
4
It's a must to try their famous chicken rice and their service is relatively fast.The rice is quite fragrant and their roast chicken skin is kinda crispy too.The chicken skin does not have much fats and the meat is very tender.I will suggest to come early as it will get crowded during dinner time
4
The Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice is a real treat. First time to try, was a great meal. The roast chicken was a bit more juicy was was the pick of the day. Worth a revisit
5
We tried this famous chicken rice at their new branch @ Marina Square. The chicken is very delicious and satisfying. It's one of the best hainanese chicken I have ever tried. The service is also excellent.
5
I came to this restaurant a few years ago with a friend and I could remembered the restaurant was super crowded. This time I came with my dad. It took me a while to find the restaurand and had to ask around the exact location. Things really changed so quickly in Singapore, the restaurant was not located at the place they used to be as now it is located right at the United Square mall.We ordered 1/4 chicken and mixed roast pork..the chicken was so tender and very delicious. My dad said it was the best chicken rice in town. The price was also very reasonable. Our meal cost S$ 20 odd dollars.The next time I come to Singapore, I will definetely come again to this restaurant. It is just like saying you have not been to Singapore if you dont try the famous chicken rice, and why settle to a second best
5
We go to the United Square outlet and it's terrific. We eat there a few times a month and it's great value for the quality of the food...flavourful, tender, juicy chicken. Good rice, with a lot of flavour on it's own. Quick service, even when there is a long queue, the staff knows how to turn tables. Highly recommend
4
I found this place was excellent for the city's famous chicken rice. Some travel guidebooks may recommend you go to the one in the hawker centre near Chinatown. However, I don't like wasting time on long queuing just for a cheap eat. This place might not the best in the city (as a matter of fact, taste good or not is so subjective), I was highly impressed by this restaurant considering the food, price (similar to food centre) and location (accessible by MRT), and environment (located inside a shopping mall)I ordered a double portion of chicken rice for two of us. I liked the chicken and the sauces. I'll visit it next time I come to Singapore again.Please remember to give the wet tissue paper back to waiters if you don't want it. They will charge you so on the bill otherwise. The restaurant had no service charge
2
Went to Marina Square, Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice outlet to have my lunch with a group of friends after our church service. It was a Sunday but noise level is still acceptable and a plus point it's their aircon.Moving on to the food, they miscalculated the huge order and only after my request, they served me my chicken as well as my extra rice. They immediately took out the chicken and the rice. However, the chicken was raw and uncooked. The bones was huge and sharp to some extent.As my friend went away for a small walk to get something, they kept her rice to keep it warm and we request it back again when she's on her way back. The stuff shouted at us saying that the they went in and out because of people like us. They did not understand that my friend is on her way back this we asked for the rice back and one of the staff just shouted at us. Horrible!Upon my friend arrival, she took out the rice and she 'slam' it on the table. Her attitude was terrible and also she shouted to her fellow colleagues about her table. We felt so mistaken and so wrong about it. Overall, a bad experience about the place
5
Over the years I have been a huge fan of Hainanese Chicken Rice, and in my opinion, wee nam kee serves one of the best. Simple, fuss and frill free, this particulat brance is located on the 4th level food court of the Marine Square mall, the escalator towards this food court needs to be searched for a bit. The ambiance is simple, the place is quite crowded so be prepared to share a table. Service is prompt. My all time favourite is the roast chicken rice with lime juice, quick, light, healthy and tastes amazing!. Always a pleasure dining here
5
We ate here before the evening rush. It can get extremely noisy here, as one previous commenter noted, but it was nice and quiet when we visited. My wife, who is originally from Singapore, ordered 1/4 of the steamed chicken and 1/4 of the toasted chicken, just so we could compare taste, along with a plate of rice for each of us.Both kinds of chicken were delicious. I'm usually not a big fan of the steamed chicken, but this was very enjoyable. The hot sauce and ginger sauce in the jars on the table, the condiments that really make or break the flavor of the fish, we're both quite good. The rice was flavorful and made a good accompaniment to the meal.Total damage was S$19, or, at the exchange rate that day, about US$14. Can't beat that for quality and quantity.Highly recommended
5
We finally got a chance to dine at the famous wee nam kee.. The chicken rice is very good... that my husband and I decided to add one more portion. Kids love the noodle too in here and ate it with the chicken. Service is good. We called in advance to reserve just because we were afraid that the place would be packe
5
We dined at this very popular Restaurant on a few occasions during recent 7 days in Singapore. The Manager went the extra yard to make us welcome, even to introduce us to the owner Mr Wee.He suggested that we ring in advance and make a table reservation, the restaurant is very popular with local residents around main meal times. Would recommend trying the the Roast/BBQ Pork rice priced at SG$4 a serve
5
For my kids and I, this is our comfort food in Singapore!
We love the chicken rice and pork/shrimp roll all the time!
5
Was here 10 years ago. Restaurant moved and is now larger and more modern. But chicken rice still the best. I love it with the roasted chicken. Served with the best chicken broth. Cheap but delicious. A must whenever I am in Singapore.
4
Delicious chicken rice in Singapore. Variety of dishes and queue is needed especially weekend dinner. Good chilli paste complement the rice.
5
Their chicken rice is awesome (roasted n steamed). Me and husband always go to their United Square branch. Must try their steam chicken rice (ask for chicken breast part) and their kaylan with oyster sauce.
5
Just popped in for an easy lunch and was pleasantly surprise by the attitude of the staff. Such a delightful lunch. Price was pretty standard for a restaurant in a mall but the food quality makes up for it.
3
We visited on a weekday dinner time and were seated right inside the restaurant where it was quite packed. While the food was good (we had chicken rice and cuttlefish with vegs), the noise level was intolerable, probably also because of poor noise insulation. Sit near the entrance if you want to eat here. Would have given 4 stars if not for the noise.
2
I visit Singapore once every couple of years and every time when I do go there, I would go to my favourite chicken rice place across the Novena Church. However the last time I went back, I was told by the hotel reception that the chicken rice place named Wee Nam Kee had moved to a better place with air condition. When I got there, I was impressed by the place and for such a hot climate in Singapore, the air condition in the restaurant was a welcome change. As usual I ordered my usual vegetables with mushrooms, won ton soups and a plate of steamed chicken rice. The presentation was the same and so was the service, no complaint there. However, the chicken did not taste fresh at all and not as delicious as before. Also the vegetables were kind of raw and hard, only the won ton tasted the same. I was very disappointed. The price was increased which to me, though was not much, but I did not think the food was worth the price. I don't know what happened to the restaurant. They were so much better back at the old location. It is sad that even my favourite Singapore chicken rice place is no more.

Off the plane from Changii airport after no sleep from London , heard about this place from other TA users and headed straight there for lunch . Very authentic looking and greeted well by the staff . Opted for a steamed and roast chicken combo with green veg and wanton soup as sides . A meal for 4 with beers was $54 sing dollar , about Â£25 which we thought was great value for the quality and quantity . Worth a vast if you are in the Marina Sq mall
5
(this is a review of the United Square Wee Nam Kee) The must visit chicken rice when you're in Singapore! Cheap, Clean, Delicious! Chicken Rice is the Singaporean de facto hawker food and Wee Nam Kee sets the bar of how good a simple dish can be. Their steamed and roasted chicken are both good with the flavour "infused" to the meat itself! Cannot have chicken rice this good back in Melbourne.My personal favorite other than the chicken is the Sambal Fried Rice (warning, Huge Portion) and their Barley for drink. Pricing is very good as well. You get half chicken for 16$ (lots of chicken chop for half chicken, better be prepared) Definitely a must visit in Singapore. Or, this might be the best chicken rice in Singapore. Place can be VERY CROWDED in lunch/dinner time, so be prepared for the long queue5/5
5
This place serve Roasted Chicken Rice, one of my favourite dish.The Roasted chicken skin is not that crispy, but it taste delicious.Used to eat this so often during college time in Singapore, and I always want to go back here whenever I had the chance
5
Just leaving a review to proclaim to the world that Wee Nam Kee serves the best chicken rice in Singapore.
3
I used to bring my friends to their original place at Novena previously. But since they moved to United Square, their standard was dropped. The rice too oily, stream chicken tasteless, price increased, service lousy. Would not recommend to friends anymore.

Just go for the chicken rice... the rest so-so....freaking good chicken!! Have try the rest and in my humble opinion this is the best! Good and friendly service, fast queue, air con but dame noisy place, polish up your food and go.
5
never tasted chicken rice this rich in flavor ever. the portion is sufficient and the chicken are generously served. perfect.
1
Tried this restaurant twice in Singapore. One near Novena MRT and the other one in a mall which I forgot the name. It was a descent meal with fair price. Food is average and service is a little bit disappointed. But I am not complaining as there are so many customers there and it reflects the popularity of this restaurant. I would recommend a quick meal here but don't expect too much from it
5
If you like chicken rice, one of Singapore signature dish you have to try Wee Nam Kee. The food is tasty, the atmosphere family friendly and the price very affordable which make it a good altenative to foodcourts (and you have aircon p!). Definitely a place i recommend for a casual meal. For the purist, better to go to the original United Square restaurant
3
We used to frequent it when it was in it's original place at Novena. Currently housed at UE it is ok. Ambiance is well not what you pay for. Service can be abrupt and cleanliness is suspect. Today chicken was good and service was efficient so thumbs up. Although I have been here before when it all goes wrong.
4
Having grown up on their Chicken Rice, it was a trip down memory lane when I brought a group of foreign fans to sample this 'staple' Singaporean dish.They didn't disappoint & my guests tucked into the meal with relish. Still one of my favourite haunts, but I'm keeping the name of the island's #1 Hainanese Chicken restaurant close to my chest - for close friends & family only
5
Coming from HK, you are used to decent hainan chicken rices everywhere, but this place was really awesome! Everything was delish including the dumpling soup, the seasonal stir-fried bean sprouts (had awesome charred taste...) and of course the roasted chicken. Loved their sauce selection. The bbq pork noodle was the only thing that was just so-so. Had a great, cheap meal... They have several locations, the one in Marina Square is in the food court but conveniently close from the hotels in the area (Mandarin, Ritz, etc.). Look forward to going back :
5
Many Singaporean friends had told me to try Wee Nam Kee, where locals instead of tourists go for the chicken rice (according to them). The chicken was really nice, so was the rice. Before Wee Nam Kee, I had tried several different chicken rice restaurants in previous visits. In my opinion, Wee Nam Keep is as good as those introduced on TV and magazines, but at much more affordable price. An 8-course set plus tea only costs 20 SGD. In those restaurants, 20 SGD could probably only buy a portion of chicken and a bowl of rice. So, this is the place if you want to check out what Singaporeans have in their daily lives
5
every trip to Singapore, my first food in-take will be chicken rice! by far nothing beats wee nam kee HCR :) especially the rice :D make sure to order the drumstick part, (the dark meat). Healthy conscience yeah white meat is great as well.
3
After landed just go to united square to eat the chicken rice i ordered half steam and quarter roast chicken ... and the winner is roasted chicken but not that good as i thought...
4
Great chicken rice. Consistent good standard of food over the years. Will pop over once in a while to eat it.
4
Since 2010, I ate Wee Nam kee opposite Novena Church many times and always had to wait for awhile for table every single time. Then the whole area was torn down. I was quite sad for a several months. Finally I saw an advertising poster in United Square that this restaurant will reopen with bigger space. I was a great new of the day. Right after its open I went there and also took a few of my visitors to this place. It's never let's me down. All my friends were happy with their foods. I repeatedly visit this place countless times. Recommended : Cha chew Grill Chicken, herb steam rice (full of aroma and tasty), fried veggies and pork ribs.
3
I ordered chicken rice, prawn mee, and so on. Food is really nice and I love the flavor, too. Size is good and satisfying your appetite. This is one of the most famous Singapore local food. I have a few disappointment. The staff is terrible. I tried to ask to order and called the staff but they let us wait for so long. They never come up to us. I felt they were not kind to customers who are not English or Chinese speakers. This is my lack of knowledge but I was shocked when I knew water and paper napkin were charge. Is this common in Singapore?
4
Lovely authentic Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore. The rice flavouring is lovely. In fact, I could just eat the rice with chiken sauce. Order the white and roasted chicken and try both of it. Not to forget , the red chilli mix with gingers. If you cant take spicy, put a little on the chicken and rice. You will have a mixed flavour when you eat. I normally like to ask them to give me the chicken sauce to put on top of my rice
4
I've gone here so much I can't even recall just how many times.. the chicken rice is so delicious, along with the dumpling soup, sweet and sour pork, and the LIME JUICE! You must try the lime juice.. I have fallen in love! Although the service could be better (when I say better, I mean A LOT better), the food is still great for a good price. The staff seems miserable though and they are frequently quite rude
5
I came to know this place years ago when it was across from Novena Church on Thomson Road. Now there is a branch in Marina Square and a branch in United Square (Novena...just near the original). I visited the branch at United Square. If anyone remembers the old place, the new one seems ultra posh, but really they kept many of the things (especially the menu) the same. Their chicken rice really is fantastic and one of the best in Singapore. Their other dishes are equally amazing. Come with a local who speaks Chinese or you might feel frustrated... definitely worth locating and having a meal here. Oh yes... and the prices are very decent for Singapore
4
I've had chicken rice in other places, this one was one of the better. Chicken rice itself is a bit bland and uneventful (I'm from Louisiana, so I have a higher need for spice!). This place does chicken rice pretty well. Found the service and price to be ok
3
We went back to the Marina branch for dinner, as we were staying at the nearby Pan Pacific Hotel.There were definitely fewer customers, perhaps from the rat incident at the porridge place next door. We ordered a plate of roast chicken and a plate of steamed chicken. I preferred the steamed, as it was moist and absorbed the sesame and soya sauce better. Portions were largish, which was nice.We also ordered prawn dumpling soup, and a plate of Kai Lan in oyster sauce. A meal for two came up to around $25, which was not bad
4
One of my favourite Singaporean dishes would definitely be Chicken Rice and this is a great place to have it!
5
This is my favorite chicken rice in Singapore. i have tried many places, but the roast chicken here tops them all.
the crispy squid dish is excellent!
5
Silky smooth and very tender chicken, flavour that is just right, fragrant rice that is fantastic, great service, nice ambience to he restaurant, and efficient staff.
5
Wee Nam Kee have 2 brances, 1 opposite novena church and another in marina square. Marina square outlet taste average, but the one in novena is the original. Have went there many times and liked the chicken rice a lot, the white chicken taste smooth while the roasted chicken very crispy, highly recommende
2
I don't think the chicken rice is very special. It is average at best. There are better chicken rice out there (e.g. The Big Bird, old airport road hawker centre). The service is horrible... servers are curt, although not expecting much from a crowded place. I will not spend to come and dine here on my own
4
We had heard of this dish (chicken rice) from lots of travelers and decided to go to this restaurant to have some. The female waitress had very little English, but we just pointed and she understood. The older man came over, and in very good English, explained all the condiments which was appreciated very much. An English couple dining next to us advised that they were on a holiday and had returned to this establishment after living in England. They loved it, so did we
5
no doubt this is my best chicken rice ive ever eaten in my life, really recomended, beware it causes an addiction, i allways visit wee nam kee everytime i travel to singapore, roast chicken is my favourite, the restaurant allways packs in lunch and dinner tim
4
I grew up with Wee Nam Kee next to Novena. It has been my favourite place for Chicken rice since more than 10 years ago. Tried the new outlet in Marina Square recently, certainly brought me back to my childhood. Makes me want to move back to Singapore just to have their chicken rice again
2
Have been a regular at this restaurant for many years since their days at Novena.Although they continue to enjoy good patronage, I may have said my goodbye to them yesterday. Operations wise, they are in quite a mess despite innovating their operations with a slew of iPads introduced.Our order of chicken/char siew was delayed and we had to push to get our plate. When it came, it was not the order we placed.Service staff can never be found when you need service. Most faces are glum and cold.The way they clear tables and cutlery leave much to be desired - one can easily lose their appetites when the big black pail comes calling.There is no sound ventilation so it will be an absolute racket when the place is filled up.Food wise, it may be not be as good as before but it is still acceptable. At $27 for 2 persons, it is very expensive to eat chicken rice here these days.Not sure if we will be back.
4
This is one of our most frequent store at United Square. Why do we frequent this place, because the chicken rice is the best in Singapore. We never had a chance to have negative feedback for the food. This is one crowded restaurant, so getting the attention of the staff is not easy. Their zhi char is also delicious but still can't beat their chicken rice!!
5
For chicken rice lovers who can't get a seat or table at Marina Square, go to their branch at Katong 112. Plenty of seats and almost no queue. I eat there regularly and quality is consistently good and service is fast.
5
First time @ marina square. Great value for price. Fragrance rice and nice Chilli sauce. Ordered both steamed and roasted chicken. Love both. Will visit again.
1
What a letdown! Fsh head curry was super diluted, the ladyfingers too "old" (hard to chew). It's food that you eat to keep you alive and not food to die for. Dont waste your time and money there!
1
The service staff was rude and impatient, and the food was yet another disappointment.. Will not be returning ever again!
4
The hainanese chicken rice with very nice with fragance and chilli sauce. It is authentic and good value for price
4
I had been to their outlet in Novena Ville, but never to the Marina Square site before. Marina Square outlet is definitely more comfortable. Same quality of food, but better place and service. This is one of my favorite chicken rice in Singapore. Beside the chicken rice, do order their To Mio (veggies) sauteed with garlic. I think they have the best To Mio. Every place can sautee the To Mio but somehow they always cook it just right. Not over/under cooked. Definitely a must try
4
We had friends over fm Beijing. Theyve stayed here before so chicken rice is no stranger to their palates,in fact its a must have every visit.Todays visit is their 1st n mine since the reloc. ation so expectations werent high as we always thought there are better alternatives. The weather had a hand in todays choice and we were glad as at quarter past 7 at dinner there were tables seemingly begging to be filled. We just plonked ourselves down as there was no one to say otherwise.Ordering was simple enough. Tick,check hhmmm shud we get this or that.....Food came fast but the subsequent requests for more chilli sauce went unheeded,looking out for staff to take further orders was quite a task. They would walk past and not acknowledge nor take orders. It was a pity for poor service to take reviews duwn a couple of notches.The roasted chicken absolutely no complaints ;sambal kangkong also recommended,but this time the fish head curry took the cake. Super fresh fish,well cooked gravy, al dente ladies fingers and savoury enough to have a chilli bite yet comfortable for all.What else is there to say? This is the place to come if a/c is a must have with the pre requiste top of the line food.This review would not have happened if not for the fact that my friend went through the chilli sauce like no tomorrow. And he does not take too hot stuff most times. Yep, the chilli is that good.....Worth dropping in if poor service is offset by great friends and company,great food keep you distracted
5
I can vouch that this is in the top 5 chicken rice. The service is poor, but there's air con, and there's unlimited garlic/ginger on the table, plus unlimited chicken rice chilli! Expect to pay $7 for a plate just like at Food Republic, rather than the normal $3, but know that it's worth every cent
5
The best Chicken Rice in Singapore. I am new to Singapore and trying this Singapore's signature meal every where to find the best ones. So far, this is best in terms of value and taste. Even compare with those in Hotel restaurants with 10 times price tag, this one has best flavour and perfect match to the ginger flavoured rice. Honestly, they should charge more. Its too cheap
4
Though we have been early there the place was fully packed. No tourist and plenty of locals with their families. It's not a place to expect a great service. It's fast efficient and nothing fancy. It can look a bit messy but it has to be like that. The portion are sized well. Try steamed and roasted chicken both are tasting delicious. They do have take away in case you don't manage to get a table
3
Good price , good food , good decoration , old chinese style but....unfortunately the service was badly , hope they can improve they hospitality skill
4
The chicken is so tender, I love the chili too. Chicken rice is nothing without the chili. They have varieties of other choices in their menus, so if you think chicken only is not enough, you can go for tofu, kailan, etc.
3
Each time we return to Singapore, we will make time for a meal here. It is consistently good, even though the service can be improved. Our usual order includes half a chicken ( both roasted and steamed skin), a bowl of wonton soup, the Pork chop special, hot plate tofu and fried kangkong in chilli. Dinner for two, including two glasses of barley drink, was about $45.They have close rivals like Boon Tiong Kee, but somehow we feel that the chicken here is softer yet more tasty.If you are keen on chicken rice like us, do also check out the store on the fifth floor of Far East Plaza, located next to Goodwood Hotel
5
This restaurant has the best chicken with rice you will eat in Singapore. Weeks before my vacation started I took the time to find out the best places to eat in Singapore. The several people I talked to and that had lived in the city mentioned that this was without a doubt the place to go. Hopefully my hotel was next to the mall where it's located. The chicken is served with the tastiest rice I have ever eaten. They also serve you an amazing broth. Besides this we also ordered the crispy pork (pitty they were only able to serve a little plate since they ran out of it) and the pork chops. The lunch was the best first meal I have ever eaten in a city. This restaurant is a must if you are in Singapore! And everything for SGD15, including beverages (beers and sodas)
4
One of the well-known chicken rice restaurant in Singapore. Wee Nam Kee has 4 branches (United Sq, Marina Sq, The Esplanade and i12 Katong). For the Marina Square branch, the restaurant is located just next to the escalator as you move up to the level 4 food court. Beside chicken rice, you can order other dishes that you typically get from the neighborhood stir-fried food stall. Bought a quarter roast chicken for $8.50 and as expected, the meat is tender with relatively crisp skin. Blend very well with the special chili sauce. The bittergourd soup ($5) and sambal Kangkong (water spinach) for $8 was relatively tasty. My kids love the Fu Rong Omelette ($8) and the lime juice is always our choice drink to go with all the dishes. Be aware that the staffs in this restaurant might not be proficient in English
5
I have always been curious about Chicken Rice from Hainan. Finally got to have some at this great little shop in Singapore. I have had some back home but everybody tells me that the best are in Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. I have now tried the one in Singapore and I am looking forward to trying in Thailand when I am there on holiday. Either way, one should not miss this restaurant if you are in Singapore. It is true, chicken rice in the southeast region is certainly better than any where else
1
This restaurant had been my favorite for the past 5 years.. And today just got one of the worst service restaurants I ever been.. The skinny waitress just ignored us even she saw us.. The waiter took the leftover and throw it that makes loud noises.. Some more got 1 children crying loudly without the parents help.. Even wee nam kee give delicious meal, I feel not delicious anymore.. Before they move to United square the service is still OK.. Now getting worse
3
this time in singapore i try wee nam kee chicken rice restaurant marina square branch. many locals recommend me to try and i do to compare with tien tien chicken rice which i eat many times before. the result in my opinion is tien tien chicken rice is better for both chicken and rice,but the sauce poured over the chicken is of wee nam kee,it smells better and stronger in taste
1
For the first time in our lives, my family and I tried Wee Nam Kee with anticipation. We heard many raves about it since the days it was at Thomson / Novena Ville, before moving to United Square. We were early so there werent any queue. Five of us were ushered to a round table.The service was utterly disappointing. The waitresses were loud and brusque, kept walking way before we even finished placing our orders. When the food came, they just plonked the food down without even announcing what item was being served, or helping to arrange / set it properly on the table. We ordered alot of items, hence the tabletop was filled with dishes naturally.One of the items we ordered was unavailable that day, but the waitress at the chopper stand kept shouting out at us - how were we to know she was talking to us, and were we supposed to shout our replacement orders back in turn?We ordered half a chicken (the oil chicken "you ji") - which was very average, not especially tender or tasty. The rice lacked fragrance of chicken rice (usually chicken rice has a distinctive ginger / garlic fragrance) and was soggy. The braised eggs and innards were bland and soggy too, and the vegetables ("you cai") was overcooked so a tad hard to chew.On top of that, we found the food to be oily overall. This was the worst meal we've ever had, and we knew we would not be back for more. Food and service leave much to be desired. Note that so far I am very kind in all my food reviews because I am not a demanding or fussy person when it comes to my food; on the contrary I am rather easy to please when it comes to dining. Hence for me to pen this painful review, the standard was really mediocre and I could find no kind words for the incredibly lousy experience
5
As often with the genuine Chinese restaurants, the atmosphere is unfortunately gloomy and un-inviting: white neons, uncomfortable seatings..but as my Chinese friends say: that's not the decoration you come for, here. It's the Hainan chicken rice. And it's totally worth the bad lightning and rock-hard sitting. We went for the poached Hainan chicken (the roasted one was out of stock already) and OH MY GOD. This is the tenderest, juiciest, tastiest Hainan chicken I have EVER had in my whole life. Even when in Hainan. It's the sauce that makes the whole difference: spicy and gingery, unlike Hong Kong were they usually substitute the spicy sauce by a nasty oil. It was awesome in taste, so much that we had to have another 1/2 chicken (we were only 3 people!). Next to it we had some fresh sautÃ©ed veggies and some curry venison (a bit blend in taste that last dish). For drinking, same comment as the decoration: un-inviting. They serve only 1 kind of beer, and in metallic cans. Too bad for the wine lover (but I believe corkage fee is negotiable if you bring your own wine).Anyhow, I don't care if the white neons of the place make my dark circles look even worse, the Hainan chicken is to die for, and I will come again and again and again in the future. So must you!Last, service was fast and efficient. Be careful they end quite early, around 9 PM. Restaurant is located in the Marina Square shopping mall. If you get there early enough, try the roasted version of the Hainan chicken! If it was sold-out, it probably means it's even better than the poached one
5
This is the best chicken rice I' ve eat in singapore. It's located at united square. No word to describe it. A MUST TRY !! This place is always full, avoid going during lunch hour.
4
I tried Wee Nam Kee chicken rice for 1 in the Marina Square branch. The dish cost just $4.80. Bargain! The rice is also yummy when added with the dark sweet soy sauce. The chicken itself is soft and tender.
3
It's nothing special, but the food is nice and they provide a good service at a fantastically cheap price. It's perfect for a quick lunch or evening meal.
4
I frequent the one at Marina Sq and I usually order the set. Chicken rice with the dumpling soup. The chicken is moist and tender and the rice is fragrant. Besides chicken rice, the hainanese pork chop is really good too. Very old school!
4
I just love this place. great tasting food. good environment. staff alway smiling and helpful. good locations. not expensive. what else do you want?my favourite is surprisingly the hong kong fried noodles and all the variants of beef, chicken and fish with garlic and spring onion. i just love these two. the chiken rice is of course very nice. so are the omlettes and the prawn balls. these are mostly what i delve into whenever i am there - focussed and straight to the heart of the matter. certainly a must go.... i used to go their novena ville outlet but then that is gone. so now it is the one in marina square...
3
The food was fine, although not fantastic, and the price was decent. I think it's more worth going just to say that I went but I wouldn't go out of my way to return. Service was pretty quick. The restaurant is also quite noisy --they even have a sign asking people to keep their voices down, but I don't think anyone reads it
5
Great way to sample Singapore's national dish. I had this at the 112 Katong Shopping Center food court. For about SDG 7.50 (USD 5.95), I had the steamed chicken with vegetable set: steamed chicken, garlic rice, broth, and bok choy with oyster sauce. My goodness, I almost cried - I missed the tastes and flavors of Asia so much! Wee Nam Kee did not disappoint. My Hainanese Chicken looked like such a common, humble dish but it was absolutely delicious!
3
I've been to both branches, the one at Marina Square last Saturday, we went to the one at United Square. For some reason, the branch at United Square was really crowded. The waitresses couldn't seem to coordinate among themselves and one showed me to a table and shortly after a Chinese speaking waitress came over and demanded to know why I was seated there. She told us rather rudely to move over to another table as she was going to seat someone else at our table. We shrugged it off, quite accustomed to the level of service in Singapore by now. A middle aged lady took our order and thankfully, this one did speak some English. Ordered half a steamed chicken, vegetables, eggs and our local friend told us to try the spare parts like the liver and some other stuff. The chicken and rice came and we were almost half way through when we realized something was not quite right, reminded the staff about the rest of our order and that's when the vegetables came and nothing else. Oh well, their loss I guess.Terrible service here, but the one at Marina Square fared better in terms of service. May have had something to do with the crowd but I wouldn't recommend the ordeal. Food was alright, there were a couple of other establishments that really did taste better. Ask your local mates
4
I loved their chicken, be it soya sauce, white or even their roast chicken. They have a lunch set which includes chicken, rice and a veg or dumpling soup. Their dumplings are filled with minced meat, chestnut and prawn and very delicious. If you prefer a healthier choice, you can always order the chicken with white rice or noodles, equally delicious.As for service, I must say they are quite friendly, especially even during peak hours (like lunch). If they are packed during lunch, may have to queue for a while before getting a seat. They also provide take aways and the chicken are well packed with ample amount of chilli, ginger and sauce to go with the chicken. We like to order their dumpling soup for take away as they will always separate the dumplings from the soup so that the dumplings are not over cooked.Their chicken is slightly more costly than boon tong kee but still value for money. Half a chicken with some side dishes is sufficient for a family of 4, and definitely cheaper than a meal at any japanese restaurant or Chinese restaurant
4
The chicken rice here is simple and delicious. Simplicity is sometimes the key to comfort food, and this in my opinion is the ultimate comfort food. I had the half roast chicken (way too much for one person, get the quarter), with rice and it was perfect. It came out a little cold but that's okay. Don't come here expecting 5 star service. Lower your expectations as with everything in life
2
The chicken rice was pretty good, but service sucks, overcrowded, noisy , forced to sit with other people
4
This is one of my favorite restaurant in Singapore.. I love their chicken rice.. And their fried shrimp.. I often order their beef black paper. Everything is so delicious for me. but i hate their service.. Very unfriendly, sometimes they were rude to us.. Price was okay, not that expensive.. But it would be worse when you come in peak hours.. Noisy..Some of them cannot understand english well.
4
Am referring to the Marina Square outlet. In the midst of generic food stalls in the food court, is an outlet of a well known chicken rice place. The place is inviting and decorated to remind patrons of its beginnings as a humble coffee shop stall. The chicken rice is consistently good with the tender pieces of chicken and the wonderful chilli with ginger. The hainanese pork chop was also very good. If you want a taste of Singapore without the perspiration, this is a good place
3
Visited the branch at Marina Square for lunch yesterday. Ordered 1/2 chicken, fritters filled with prawns, chilli kangkong, wonton soup (L size), hainanese pork chop and hotplate tofu - food was not too bad, though some portions seemed small for M size. Inclusive of drinks and rice for six people, the bill came up to around $100
2
Went to the new shop just after it opened and service was very poor, thought it maybe new openning issues. Went back again last week, waited 10 minutes before getting the menu ourselves and after trying to get their attention for 15 minutes to make our order we gave up and left. We weren't the only ones not getting service. Think they are working on reputation to make up for the very poor service.
5
Wee Nam Kee is the first Chicken Rice stall that I took notice of over 15 years ago. By far, this place offers great value at just $4+, although the portion of chicken seems to be a lot less since they moved to United Square. I rate Wee Nam Kee as one of my top three favorite chicken rice stalls
4
I was looking for this place in Thomson Road but it actually already moved to United Square just a walking distance from the previous place. While the new location wasn't exactly easy to find inside a mall but the wait and search will be rewarded with a heavenly Roasted Chicken Rice. On par with Tian-Tian Chicken rice this one have one advantage for location as it located in a mall with bus stop that's easier to reach for tourists. You should try this place and order the Roasted Chicken Rice while make sure you're belly are hungry enough to have the best eating experience.My advice is come to this place at least with one friend so that you can order various menu and shared it with your friends. I ordered one half chicken of roasted and one half of the original and roasted pork and shared them to enjoy it
4
The address on this trip advisor page needs to be updated- the new address for the restaurant is at United Square, Novena. The portions of chicken are generous and both the steamed and roast chicken are delicious. The soup is also delicious. But the best part about the place is the roast pork- crispy and roasted to perfection with a hint of smokiness- truly commendable. This is by far better than tian tian. Or big bird
4
This review is for the newly opened outlet at United Square. Wanted to take family out for dinner. Went on a Saturday 2 weeks ago and there was already a long queue at 6pm. Ordered half a chicken, large portion of vegetables and large pot of the daily double-boiled soup. No additional drinks. Standard of the food was maintained, just like it was before the move from its previous location. Place has aircon now but was noisy inside.This might have to do with the layout and design. They actually put a sign near the entrance to tell customers to keep voices down. In addition, the staff seemed a little overwhelmed. But as long as the standard of the food is kept, I think we can live with the noise for a while. Cost of meal works out to about $10 per person
4
I chose this place (branch inside a food court near the Pan Pacific hotel) for dinner on a business trip close to my hotel. I seemed to have made the right choice after hearing from a local friend that this place is famous for their Hainanese chicken rice.True to form, I asked for the steamed chicken rice and a side dish of vegetables and soup. Volume was too much for one person and better enjoyed as a group - as is usual with chinese cuisine. The main dish was very good, enough to fill your stomach and enjoy the taste but not too much to get you bloated.Service was quick and responsive despite a lot of customers in the establishment. Upon paying, I was surprised to find that it was not as expensive as I anticipated, considering the amount I ordered for one person.Very good price-performance
5
In our opinion, the chicken rice war ended with wee nam kee as the winner.
The rice were divine, and the chicken were perfect.
But i think tian2 chicken rice offer a more tasty sauces and lower price.
5
Greate chicken rice here. I normally go to the one next to marina sq food ct. as its close to the office. Their chicken is the best in town for sure. Enjoy with a fresh coconut to drink.
4
Among many big names, this one is my most favorite chicken rice restaurant in town. The chicken is very tasty and delicious. Also dont miss the dumpling soup and HK-styled crispy noodle (it is huge!).
5
I lived 2 minutes away and I ate there about twice a month. Very crowded but the best food of singapore.
4
Arrived at Novena Ville to find the place had been demolished.....desperate for their delicious chicken rice we found they had moved to United Square - a 5 minute walk away. Whilest I prefer the old location which is more outdoor the food was still up to the usual high standards. Chicken rice here is tender & tasty as is the beef with ginger & spring onions. Service was swift & prompt - to some it may appear abrupt but this I think is due to langauge barrier. Great food at very reasonable price
4
Tried this Chicken Rice restaurant when I was last in Singapore - Sep 2012 after reading review. Good size serving, cost S$4.50, delicious, tender chicken and wash it all down with cold barley drink. For other tourist reading this review, it is an open plan restaurant therefore don't think it has air-conditioning but lots of wall fan which helps (with Singapore heat, something is better than nothing. They have other a-la-carte menu besides chicken. Would I go again? If I'm happen to be in the area, won't make a trip there specially
3
Used to love going to Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice as the chicken was succulent and the rice was flavourful, also the chilli was good. Well, tried Wee Nam Kee again yesterday, chicken was still succulent, but somewhat flavorless. The rice was okay, but again not as flavourful as before
3
This is a good stall. I rated it Average as I don't think I want to rate it Very Good. The food is still tasty though. For first-timers or tourists, do try this as it is one of the iconic dishes of Singapore. After eating it for years, I can still call it average/good - meaning it is quite good
3
Singapore has lots of chicken rice stalls but this seems to be one of the popular ones. It is usually very crowded, so much so that we usually just pack it. The chicken is flavorful and moist, while the rice can sometimes be a little on the hard side, but is still delicious. Do check it out if you are around Novena

I came here expecting to be bedazzled by an amazing aroma of my secodn favourite dish in the world, but I felt very underwhelmed by the average chicken, the average underwhelming not-so-flavourful rice and the more than average price. There was no wow or pizzazz in the chicken or the rice to keep me wanting more. I honestly don't see what the hype is about and I will not return
4
went for quick lunch..place was crowded but ordering was fast..after few minutes good food in front of you..really loved the chicken rice and te vegetables..good food and good to share
4
this hainanese chicken rice is well cooked. ginger sause, chille sause and black soy sause are match with chicken rice. it was hard to find black table at lunch time though, if you stay around Novena, it's worth trying.
4
As the Makansutra guide suggests, this is high quality chicken rice. Both the boiled and the roasted chicken are full of flavour, moist and the rice is highly flavoured individual grains. The chilli sauce is good and the ginger excellent.

Hainanese Chicken Rice has been my and few of my friends favourites. The aroma and the smooth texture of chicken was a mouthwatering experience. A must visit for the Chicken Rice fans!

As taste & expectations may vary from person to person, so might this review to be understood about Chicken Rice in Singapore. I have been working here for many years, eaten at many Restaurants, Hotels & of course Food Stalls- & Courts. Having eaten Chicken Rice for the 1st time at former Chatterbox at Mandarin Hotel Orchard Rd, I became a lover of this simple but delicious dish in Singapore and in fact throughout Southeast Asia. WEE NAM KEE CHICKEN RICE remains for me the best also because they managed to maintain the quality & standard of their most popular dish at Novena: Chicken Rice! For all Non-Singaporeans, especially expats from a Western country, you must be told that you are eating a delicious meal at low price in a fresco typically Singaporean eating environment: Food Stall! It's Singapore and I like it this way. Service is rather emotionally & sometimes rude when you don't understand every word the Chinese staff are speaking to you. English works most of the time - at least! Always remember one thing: You are going there for the Food and not because of an outstanding Service experience

Love Everything about it the rice , chicken, sauce . The roast chicken is soft and tender. Many places in Singapore serve very nice chicken rice but it is mainly the white ones that is very nice but for Wee Nam the roast one is as nice ! It's really rare to be able to eat roast chicken rice of such quality
5
There is always this impending fear in Singapore that our favorite comfort foods would degenerate in quality and value as the older generation hand over the reins .I can say categorically that chicken rice ala Wee Nam Kee is not one of them . Although it is certainly not a place that I would bring my clients in suits, I have had cheery meals with good friends and new acquaintances to Singapore and with my relatives .Often, we will takeaway half or one chicken , with many packets of rice and have a finger licking feast at home. They do not give soup, but next time, I will try to remember to bring a container and ask sweetly - then I can put in shredded cabbage to recreate the nostalgic Chicken rice experience as per my corner coffee shop when I was growing up in Katong .Though very busy, the servers are sweet once you get to know them, a crooked smile, and always obliging . Highly recommended anytim

Hainanese chicken rice is one of my favourite things to eat and I have not found anywhere in my home town that does it as well as they do in Singapore. When we arrived in Singapore we headed for the Maxwell Street Hawkers Centre to have some Chicken Rice at Tian Tian. To our horror it was closed for renovations. Some quick research in the Makansutra Guide however established that this place was worth a try. Indeed it was. For a start it was restaurant where we could sit out side and be served as opposed to negotiating the long queues at Tian Tian. We had some of the best chicken rice we have ever eaten with some lovely green vegetable and lime juice all for the princely sum of $19 Sing dollars. A great new discovery - highly recommended.

Wee Nam Kee is almost always busy, and for good reason, their Chicken Rice is fantastic. I used to live down the road and whenever I had visitors in town this was where I'd take them for their first Singapore meal. They'd almost always want to go back before the end of their trip.The chicken is always moist and succulent. The service is no frills, grab a seat where you can, have a beat up menu left of your table and try to decipher the menu. The place is usually packed, so the staff doesn't have a lot of time to answer questions. It's easiest to just say that you want Chicken Rice for the amount of people at the table. Then it's a choice of the roasted or boiled, and if you want the chicken breast. For westerners, it's best to start with the roasted version.They also have good vegetables, there is a mixed vegetables with oyster sauce that goes well with the chicken. I'd also recommend their lime juice, helps with the burn when you dip the chicken in too much chili sauce.It's also best to sit outside, as the inside can get really hot and really loud. Don't let the fact that you're roadside and near a bus stop fool you. Once you get the food you won't notice the cars anymore
5
Wee nam kee is known for the chicken rice but i love their cereal prawn more than the chicken rice.. Its hard to describe the taste.. Its the aroma , sweet n garlic, taste that made it unique.. A must try dish. Their chicken is very tender ofcourse and you need to match it with the three sauces - perfect! But this is outdoor so you need to withstand the noontime heat. And this is usually packed so go early.
5
Succulent meat. The chilly sauce with the ginger is to die for! Even my foreign guests were amazed at the meat's texture and tenderness. If only MSG is omitted, it would even be better. No where else in Singapore can I get the same quality!
4
I been here few times but their chicken rice still good, never fails. Soft succulent chicken and I always order few more dishes. All of them were delicious! I will always go back again and again everytime I visit singapore.
5
Great place for traditional Hainanese Chicken rice! The chicken is cooked to perfection, delicately flavoured and the rice, cooked in chicken broth is divine! Couple it with the fantastic chilli sauce and you have an addictive yet healthy treat!
4
One of the best chicken rice in Singapore. The chili is great the rice is fragrant
Chicken is absolutely tender and to die for.
3
Never leave Singapore without eating its crabs (pepper or chili sauce), laksa soup and Hainanese Chicken rice. Having said that you can do it in the best restaurants in town located in the best hotels (Fullerton, Raffles etc) or try a very local experience for once. Here it is. For about 1/10th of the price those five star hotel restaurants would charge (which is absolutely normal considering the good service, the quality of their ingredients, the atmosphere etc) you you can try, in a very minimalistic and simple / basic setting, a food that is a national pride. It is good but of course not exceptional. A good occasion to also taste the local atmosphere of a daily life of local people
5
Been there a good number of times; it offers one of the best chicken rice in Singapore. I have tried the white chicken and the roasted chicken, both are equally good. The chicken is tender and rich in flavour and it goes extremely well with the rice. The soup is fragrant, light and delectable. This is something that you truly would not want to miss
4
We absolutely love the Hainanese Chicken rice here! I like to mix the roasted and steamed chicken for the full experience. I also recommend the Cereal Prawn. Very laid back ambiance, nothing fancy. It's hard to linger over the food though as there are always customers waiting for a table. Will visit everytime we are in Singapore
3
I was so excited to come here because I heard it was the best for Hainanese Chicken Rice. I went to the original restaurant and honestly while it was good, it was no different from the Hainanese Chicken Rice I eat in my home country. It was just okay. Frankly, the Toastbox restaurant near where I live in Laguna, Philippines serves better Hainanese Chicken Rice than The Wee Nam Kee I visited in Singapore =( I don't think the trip is worth it. Other hawker centers in Singapore offer it and they are probably just as good or better
5
... loved this place. It is impossible not to love all hawker food. I thought it was very good with suitably indifferent service and well priced for me as a Westerner. Get there early if you want the roast chicken which I prefer and while you are waiting, you can even play the under rated game of "squash a cockroach" when sitting outside. A useful marker in my continued education of Chicken Rice
5
My sister's bro inlaw took us to Boon Tong Kee last Nov'11 and I was thinking to go back to BTK again, but then stumble upon this restaurant on Tripadvisors and decided to give it a try.In my opinion, the quality does match the hype. The rice is soft and fragrant and the chicken (both roast and white) is yummy & tender without showing blood like some hainanese chicken joint. Don't bother to order other dishes though, coz you might be disappointed. Hainan Chicken is what they specialize, and they do it simply the best!Tip: 2 or 3 doors down sell tofu pudding. Do give it a try. I like the durian one. The first time I had my tofu pudding with my favorite fruit, durian, and it's out of this world!
4
bear with the rude service but WNK is one of the better chicken rice institutions around. Tender moist and juicy, with fragrant grains of rice. Standards have been consistent in the last decade.
3
Rice and chicken was average. The price is on the high side considering there are lots of chicken rice available everywhere.
4
Lived in Singapore many years ago and Wee Nam Kee restaurant was close to our house. Again this evening they did not fail to delivery excellent food. If you would like to experience great food, come and order their white and roasted chicken with rice. Everything else on the menu is worth trying, but you will need more then one visit to do that. You know when a restaurant is good, you just have to look at locals eating there. As soon as table becomes empty, there are people waiting to sit down. Local food and excellent value
5
I would like to thank our my tour guide for introducing this restaurant to us. I think this is the best meal we had. The Hainanese chicken and its and special soy sauce and ginger is fantastic! And though i'm slightly allergic to seafood, the prawns are great, and I think I had more than what's supposed to. The servings are huge also, value for its price. I noticed too that in the restaurant, there were a lot of patrons, I guess it simply means that I'm not making this u
5
Every time I visit Singapore I always visit this restaurant cause their Chicken Rice is just simply delicious!!! It just simple Hainan Rice topped with Boiled or Roasted Chicken, but is so irresistible!! dipped the chicken meat to the salty sauce or grind pepper sauce for enhanced flavor and you will never regret to visit this place :
4
Honestly the first time I tried Wee Nam Kee Chicken rice was in Manila as they already have expanded outside of Singapore. Then I already liked it.Then I managed to find a job in Singapore, and so now, I come here at Thomson Road almost every Saturday afternoon. I usually am famished by the time I get here so I have two orders of steamed chicken($4x2). I usually add as much ginger as I can. Usually I also bring my own napkin so I don't pay the additional $0.20. =) For $4SGD, its hard to beat the value. Yes, as other have said, the ambience or the service could be improved. But considering that if they moved to a new location with airconditioning and improved the service, they might have to increase the price. So I'm very happy to have my chicken rice the way it is at its current price.If you want ambience, then go to Marina Bay Sands Hotel or some other joint
5
Been here many times. Always packed, always delicious. Eating by the side of a busy road (and steps away from a bus stop) may not be everyone's idea of a good place to eat, but it just adds to the no frills approach of the place. Order your food, eat, and go. The chicken rice is one of the best on the island. A must-go for visitors wishing to sample this great "local" dish
5
This is the best hainanese chicken rice in Singapore for me... The roast chicken,steamed chicken and fritter with mayo ! Superb..! A very wise choice for breakfast... But i think they need to have a better place,because the current place is the way to crowded and no ac :
4
. Review is based on their outlet at "112 Katong" Mall.Very clean appearance and friendly staff. Just stopped for a lunchtime snack of chicken rice and very good it was at the price of $13 with veg plate.Clearly a very popular venue with Singaporean families shopping at the mall.Looking forward to visiting again
5
This is my first visit, with my mom and siblings. All 6 of us loveeeeeeeeeeee it!! The steamed chicken is so yummy. The roast pork is so crunchy. The hainanese rice is very delicious. I don't really like the broccoli, not recommended. Next visit to Singapore, it's a must-eat place.The foods remind me of my childhood restaurant we used to go visit for dinner with our dad. It called Singapore Restaurant, in Jakarta. Aaaah, good memories
3
Good if you like oily chicken rice. Not so great if you are watching your waistline. There are other options.
4
Was a pimply teenager in 80s till now in my 40s - this store still serves the best roasted chicken, spiced with to die for ginger / chilli concoction eaten with aromatic garlicy frangance sesame oiled rice. My kids love em too!
3
As I said, affordable with good food... lots of people come here...but ambiance is so so...just a typical canteen type.... well, who cares, as long as the food is good....
3
I have always had good service and the prices of his dishes are reasonable.
2
Service is lousy. Workers shouting everywhere, even at customers. Got food orders wrong and rude.
5
Delish & cheap local cuisine. If you come to Singapore and want to try local food - Chicken Rice has to be on the list & this place is a must!For those who prefer a healthier option, order boiled chicken (chicken breast only if you prefer) & ask for the skin/bones to be removed.
3
The first time we visited, the skin of the roasted chicked was perfect as it was just taken out from the roast machine. The second time we visited, the skin was soggy, typical of the kind you find at a foodcourt. That's why I gave "Spin the wheel' as my title
4
Again, this is one of those restaurants that I would often come back to... Safe to say, I do business with this establishment at least once a month.The chicken rice here is dubbed as one of the best in the island - it is one of the must try dishes here I should say. The cereal prawn is also not too bad as well as their sauteed ginger beef.Since this is a famous restaurant, you may encounter some queue time before you will be seated. So patience is needed here.Speaking of patience, you definitely need those as the waitresses here can barely understand English. On my latest visit, I had to return 2 dishes as they were not the ones I ordered. In fairness to them though, they were very apologetic about their mistake.Cost-wise, I would say it would be affordable (not as cheap as hawker food though) - roughly 10SGD per person if you order a dish each and this comes with drinks already.If you are a tourist in Singapore with some extra time, a stop here for a meal would be nice - otherwise you may ought to just stay in the city center
4
I would say that that the food are superb!!Most peeps complain about service. This is a Chinese resto, so sit, order quickly, eat and go. Don't chat or browse the menu and ask (in English) for all the description. Of course they will not entertain that. They're Chinese so they don't speak English well obviously. I don't speak English. But I manage to go here n get a decent service.My tips are:1. Order packet of Rice+chicken (choose steam/boil, choose drumstick/bReast meat)2. Or order half/whole chicken3. Order ur veggie (toMiau or kangkong)4. Order dumpling soup5. Order your drink (lime juice/barley)That's it. If you want to order more or ask about the menu, I suggest u bring a translator.

this place was recommended to me by my friend who resides in Singapore. I had to walk a bit in order to reach it in Thomson Road. It was noon and it was a hot sunny day in Singapore. When I got there, it was utterly chaotic and the place was full. I opted to do take out since all the tables were taken. I didn't know where to order , they didn't have signs and when you ask the staff they talk to you in Chinese (maybe coz I kinda look Chinese) and try to ignore you. I can't blame them the place was just too stressful. So I hurriedly got my order after waiting and ate in my hotel room. The experience was stressful and the heat made it worse. But the Hainanese Steamed Chicken is good though and you can get a meal for $4SGD or $3USD or 130 peso
5
Its famous, and lives up to the hype. The chicken is moist, and juicy. The rice is fragrant, and the chilli is slightly spicy, and aromatic.
4
Decent chicken rice. Roast and white. Very crowded.
1
Must prepare that the staff has no service, rather rude and Disgusting. I will never go back regardless of food taste.
5
Went there twice in July and chicken rice was excellent. Rice and veg were good too. Better than Mandarin Chatterbox and a lot cheaper.

On 3-01-12 at around 6pm, i took a sit in the air-con rm n was ask to sit outside by the noodle cook( guy around 50plus of age, who stand facing the air-con room) saying not enough man-power but after 5min, i saw someone taking the same sit inside,this is one poor services. When a lady take my order, i ask for a chicken rice n a veg, then she say $6:40 veg? i then told her is for me alone just a small one will do, then she say in a harsh way that no veg for one person.what is this man. So simple when I order, she can ask isit a small one,so simple right??? I just don't want to argue with them cos I understand they are working but pls serve the customer well cos we do not eat for free. Is this how they serve when the bill don't include service charge or are they showing bias,if u wanna eat there, wear a tie n pant but not sports wear.very very bad services,I hope the management can do something about this. Do they like ppl to serve them this way when they dine out? I will never return to this place again although the food is gd. There are still many gd chicken rice in Singapore

We were visiting from the States. As a local I was craving to try the Hainam Chicken Rice in Singapore. We were recommended WNK as one of the famous and a MUST!.1. Ambience - was not good - with flies here and there, on the table.2. Patio Furniture - need to be replaced.3. Tables were not cleared and set-up promptly for next customer.4. Condiments on table did not look clean and fresh.5. Mediocre chicken rice - tasted better elsewhere, namely food courts.6. Noticed waitress serving a plate of chicken with fly on top; she did not bother to wave it away, but the customer was waving the fly off.7. Noticed Mina birds settling on patio tables to feed on scraps of food as were leaving.8. Certainly we will not return NOR recommend
5
A favorite of locals, this restaurant gets very crowded during meal times. 3 types of chicken are available: "white" chicken (boiled chicken), chicken braised in brown sauce and roast chicken. the chicken rice is fragrant. Typically eaten with dark brown sauce, minced ginger, and garlic chilli sauce. Other favorites at this restaurant include barbeque meat, dumpling soup and vegetables with oyster sauce
3
Based upon the crowds for Sunday lunch, this place has quite a following-we got the last open table before a queue of 15 or so people formed.Perhaps the Danish reviewer who got the boneless chicken ordered a different chicken serving, but our breast had plent of bone (not a complaint just more of a word of advise to not assume you will get boneless unless you specifically ask)My colleague who is a local guy loves this place-I didn't have the heart to tell him that I enjoyed the chicken rice from the company canteen!! I would review that but it doesn't really have a name, nor is it open to outside business
5
I visit Wee Nam Kee Chicken rice annualy for the simple reason which is: it is the best. The roasted chicken breast (no bones) is chopped into mouth sized bits, it is succulent, with a crisp, tasty skin. I personally like to top it off with a dash of chili sauce for some heat. The rice is perfectly steamed and infused with the rich aroma of ginger and garlic. Simply amazing! Furthermore, it only costs around 6S$ for a 4 person portion
5
My son has fairly conservative food tastes due to various allergies. Consequently he has eaten Chicken Rice MANY times in Sngapore over the last 12 years - and he says this is the best. I agree with him.Simple food served well with excellent chilli sauce (the key thing required to elevate 'good' chicken rice to 'excellent')
1
The chicken rice is sub par, the other dishes- we had the Japanese tofu, it was terrible. Was pretty expensive for a shop of it's kind.
5
Love the chicken rice. Waitresses are a bit pushy in turning you away when you're done to make room for new customers. No ambience but the food more than makes up for it.
3
nice but abit too salty, i prefer melaka "chong hua" chicken rice ball
3
i love their roast chicken here. comes with a delicious crispy skin. but thats about it. the cze char is about average, the rice nothing special and the white chicken just alright.
3
Good chicken rice.
3
Wouldn't consider this THE best Hainan chicken rice restaurant. The rice is much mushier/softer and fragrant than Chatterbox. Chicken portion is less, about 1/4 less. No soup, just a plate of chicken and rice. The price is the best at S$4.00 compared to S$25.00 at Chatterbox, (only difference is the bowl of soup and the 5 Star hotel rating).No comparison on ambience and cleanliness. You'll want to leave WKN ASAP. Service is pretty good though.Been to both, done that...check mark on the bucket list

There are countless delicious chicken rice stalls in Singapore, with notable names like Boon Tong Kee, Mandarin Chicken Rice, Five Star, etc. None of these mentioned ranks even up there with Wee Nam Kee. Though I must point out at this stage that Idon’t find Wee Nam Kee as the greatest chicken rice I’ve ever had, it certainly is high up there.Most shops are specialised for either their “pak cham kai”(steamed/boiled chicken) or roasted chicken. But at Wee Nam Kee, the soya chicken is outstanding. The rice is yummy fluffy, compelling flavoured, only slight oiled. Some people says that the chilli sauce is the crux of the entire chicken rice. Whether you make it or break it, it is the chilli sauce. The chilli sauce here has a bite to it that is both savoury and tangy.What is essentially an everyday dish, Wee Nam Kee’s chicken rice is effectively executed and it tastes exactly like what it’s supposed to: soft, fragrant, flavoursome and full of chicken stockiness(www.perfyi.wordpress.com
2
Wee Nam kee failed miserably in every aspect of my rating of the stall. To begin with, the food is not authentic. Then the service!!! I can almost write a whole chapter about how arrogant and rude they are ... about how they often over-charge unsuspecting customers etc.I have stopped eating there for years and vow never to return
5
I lived in an apartment above Wee Nam Kee for ten months. I ate there at least once per week; never had a bad meal. (Important: tell the taxi: "Chicken Rice on Thomson Row, opposite Novena Church." Don't use the address as 275 Thomson.)If you want to get a sense of Singapore as a nation in its daily life, come here. The tables are always full and the place mixes the high and low end of Singapore society with foreigners sprinkled throughout the mix. Mr. Wee runs a busy business for a reason (and he is a great guy, as is his son who works there as well). I have had taxi uncles tell me that they have had customers take a cab from the other end of the island (Jurong) just to have chicken rice here!The food is a great value. The chicken rice is amazing; however, as an American I recommend having it twice. The first time I was disappointed due to the build up by Singaporean friends. All I saw on my plate was rice, chicken and some veggies. It wasn't until the second time that I began to really appreciate the subtlety of the dish. And now? It really is one of the places I miss most and one of those foods I would consider a comfort food. It is perfect for a rainy afternoon as take out or on a busy Sunday midday to people watch.It is one of those places I unreservedly recommend to friends as a MUST eat when in S'pore

This stall lacks in terms of hygiene---and service. There were several birds perched on the tables placed outside the stall-----all feasting on the ginger and chili sauces placed in the cruets and left uncovered for most of the day. Leaving them exposed poses a serious threat to the consumers----as it allows bacteria from the birds' mouths and from the air to contaminate the sauces. The staff at the stall, though, did not even seem about it and made no effort to shoo these birds away from the stall. Because of this, the droppings of the birds on the table (if any) would make it even more unpleasant for the diners. The owner of the stall was aware of this upon being contacted; but quickly dismissed it and continued ignoring the situation

Dad's favourite

Used to be better (especially the Chili sauce) but still much above average.

One of my favorite places for Chicken Rice.

fragrant~
2
Used to be 5-Stars in up till the 90's. Son is not as good as the father.
4
great porridge
4
rice is flavorful and fluffy, drizzled with good amount of sesame oil.. chicken is fat and juicy.. and the chilli... ohhh YUM
2
The chicken is over-rated. Most of the food here are too salty.
2
ok lor.... no need to miss ittt....
4
nostalgia, i grew up in that area so this is biased. but hey, it's still nice!
2
This is again another over rated chicken rice...
4
their sambal fried rice(chicken) is my fav!
5
Yummylicious chicken, rice, dry noodles and ohhh, that soup...! Once in a while though, the chicken can be a little over-cooked.
2
Very crowded... But nice Chicken Rice
5
Long queue!! But worth the wait.

So-so.
5
My favorite chicken rice is here! Some of my friends do not agree with me though!
4
Affordable and tasty chicken rice. I like the other options of food there too.

One of my fav chicken rice stalls. A bit oily though and only white chicken iirc.
4
my daily food...
2
Not bad
3
overrated, untasty chicken rice (and here, I'm referring to the rice, especially). Don't know why so many sing high praises of this dingy joint
3
Chicken very fragant but a bit oily!
3
Ok.
4
The dumpling soup is good. Thjey are very generous with the fillings for the dumplings.
3
my fave is still Big Bird Chicken Rice cos of the chilli!
3
Tasty slight above average chicken rice. Very resonable price considering that this is one of the Top 5 Premier League chicken rice specialist. Should improve on ambient settings to keep up with others.Still, Five Star East Coast Rd for the chicken meat, Boon Tong Kee River Valley for the rice
