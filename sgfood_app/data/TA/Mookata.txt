Brought my family for their first mookata experience. The set for 4 pax is quite filling, though the meat quality can be better. Some of the quality meat like kurobuta pork and wagyu pork are unavailable though, which is a disappointment.

Normal.
Reasonable price although not many choices for food, but good enough for small eater and short gathering.

Flavourful Mookata. Meat were tender and soup is sweeter after all the essence from the meat drip into the base. Nevertheless, only soft drinks and no beer. Add the alcohol and it would be perfect. Atmosphere was good. 3 pax around $90 for ala carts.

We had a bad experience with their service although the food there was good. This should be my first and last visit

Staffs are friendly. They will help to clear away our plates. Overall their services are very good. Will recommend to Friends.

It was my second visit but first time trying the buffet. Food was worth thw price with some dishes worth the calories like tom yum chicken and sliced salmon.
4
Good ! Service is slight slow down at peak hour. Food else is food and tasty. Atmosphere is good for cheer with friend.

iPad ordering is supposed to expedite things but the staff seemed not to be looking at the orders rolling in. The food is substantial (3 of us ordered one set for 2 with one additional meat serving) and well-marinated. No post-bbq medical trauma for us, phew!
4
Food is good as usual. The only down thing is the number of staffs in the shop. You can see them rushing here and there for food ordering, cleaning table, cashier all by just 3 of them at the time I visitied then which is 7pm on Friday. The boss should hire more staffs for peak hours!!!!

We're a fan of Mookata especially in Bangkok's BarBQ Plaza. So, we opted one day to have our dinner here at Mookata Bugis Junction.As we were there during peak time, we were given a table even when we did not made any reservation. Food was great, with a variety of meat choice. My son enjoyed himself as he loved the cooking part, which he did himself on the Mookata plate

Limited selected for the buffet spread. Replenish of the food is slow. No one clear the dishes at your table..
1
Few choices, no fruits, seafood, coffee and tea. Not worth the money as compared to Seoul Garden and other steam boats buffet. I will not recommended to my friend.

Clean and not so smelly, food was OK. Service staff were not very warm, and did not accept chope voucher for buffet.
4
It's okay okay for me. Won't really recommend to friends and family to go though... the food is okay.
5
Gas based mookata, staff seems to be impatient sometimes. Good when I am having the vouchers. But I went for round 2 somewhere else.

First time try this outlet and the pork slices are very tasty. Even it is a set for 2 persons, but it is more than enough to share among 3 girls. Service is good, but it is only from a tall guy who wear spec. He looks busy from the beginning we entered the outlet. We noticed that the indoor temperature is high and asked if we could change a seat to other table under aircond, but staff told us they outlet has problem with the aircond for quite some time. So we could not move our seat. Will visit again if they fix the aircond problem.

We had planned a surprise birthday party for a friend. The staff were helpful and the food was delicious!
3
The food was tasty but not too much choices to choose from. Desserts were only 3 flavors of ice cream.
The service level of staff was good and very helpful.
4
First time there. Love the meat, esp tomyum chicken. Very fresh and special. Although its bbq, the stench after eating was not as strong as other restaurant. Worth going again.
4
Had dinner with a few friends & the bbq was great. Marinated well. The space is also ample & not cramp like typical restaurants. Manager is very polite. Price wise is reasonable.
4
Staff with very good service. Meat replenishment pretty quick although variety is not too many. The sauce is pretty good too
5
It's delicious. Price affordable (SGD 18.99++/persons & add SGD 3 on weekend)
Pork Bacon so yummie & juice
The Chilis had 3 different levels & the taste so good.
We'll back again.

This is my second time esting at Mookata. The first time was ok but this time was seriously bad. The worst mookata I have ever eaten so far. I am glad that i did not order buffet. We ordered set for 2 with extra pork liver and thai milk tea for drink. First of all, the staff are slow in serving and do not have attention to customer. We had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes for food to come. However, they forgot to serve a bowl of rice until I asked them. Secondly, the portion of food is very small. I did not expect too much but set for 2 is not good enough for 2 person. Moreover, meats were flavorless and seems like not marinated at all. The soup is another nightmare and is over sweetened by MSG ��. There are three kind of sauses and those are another disappointment. All of them have similar flavor and none of them are good to go with mookata. My overall experience at Mookata was terrible

The service was really pathetic because the staff looked miserable doing their jobs. Our stove/pan also took a long time to heat up because the flame was going out randomly several times, and none of the wait staff bothered to notice this and take action. The meat was already so bland in its marinated form, what more could we expect when it has been cooked. I also found it really strange that they served hot drinks in a normal plastic cup without the handle on the side. Little wonder that they could only afford to hire some inexperienced celebrity to be their spokesperson, who has totally convinced me that this place has zero value for money

Have visited to try mookata at this place as usually we would eat at golden mile instead. The waiter is not very friendly while we have requested things from the waitress and after that she did not get back to us, responsive is slow. The mookata price is on the high side as we ordered a 4 person set and we are still feel hungry thereafter. The food came fast though, meat marinated is good but the soup is a bit salty. Overall average

Went there for the team lunch. They dun take reservation.From the website, they mentioned that the price is around 30$ plus per person, but it turned out they have special price for lunch. So it's only around 24$ per person.Though it's a very reasonable price, the meat & vegetable selections are limited.The marinated meats are quite ok but we can not choose the soup base.No wonder their competitor in the same building ( S*ol G*r*e*) are more crowded.I like their chilli. They have 3 different level of spicyness. From low to medium to the highest.Think if they wanna grow, they really must make an improvement
