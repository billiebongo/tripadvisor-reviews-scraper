I really LOVE the decor. In all the Asian countries/cities I've been this is the best I've seen. We were the first to be seated for lunch and slowly got busier. The prices are consistent with the vast majority of Restaurants here. Although, I was very upset paying $16 for the smallest portion of Guacamole. I would think they'd make it table side for that price.The salsa and guacamole doesn't taste fresh as in made there in-restaurant even though waitress say they are. We ordered Chicken burrito and chicken enchiladas and both were tasty. Ordered Strawberry margarita and was good.For dessert we ordered Mexican fried ice cream. Wow what a huge portion...worth the money paid. HOWEVER, this is supposed to be deep fried and served right away. I don't think it's done like the real way this dessert is intended. I thinks it is friend and kept frozen. Still ok...but not how it's really done in Mexico.Def a place I'd come back again. Eat Mexican food I've had in Singapore so far

great ambience for mexican food- good number of options especially for vegetarians!we were a big group of 15 people

Good and friendly service, with a casual dining experience - what is there not to like.My wife was meeting with ex-colleagues, one of whom is a vegetarian, and they suggested meeting here.We started with a pitcher of - you guessed it - margaritas, though the designated driver opted for a virgin mohito.Foodwise. It was mostly good, including the nachos with beef, quesadillas and beef burritos. The fish tacos were not as tasty though. It was a tad expensive, but a good place to hang out. They recently renovated the toilets, removing some of the bottles on display, though some can now be seen on the walls outside

After eating Asian food for 2 weeks, we were ready for a change, on Friday we tried italian at Etnas and yesterday we tried Margarita for some mexican food.We were kind of sceptical because of the 6000 miles from Mexico to Singapore but we felt like in Polanco, mexican beer like Tecate, I ordered chicken and beef fajitas and the tortillas were excellent, and the chicken/beef was really good.The place is very clean and a very friendly staff.My recommendation, be sure to make a reservation if you want to go after 7:30 pm, and that applies to all good restaurants in Singapore.We had only beers and they have an offer, a bucket of 6 for less price,Like at Edna's, we ended up paying an average of 50-55 usd each.Dempsey Hill has a lot of good restaurants, not cheap but its worth visiting them

We went again on new year eve and were again delighted by excellent service and veg Friendly food. They took extra care to prepare food without onion and garlic on a busy day . The food was delicious
4
This is my 1st time to actually having Mexican food. This place is quite cozy. Service was great. Food taste good but I'm quite surprise with their prices
4
We ordered burritos and fajitas with frozen margaritas. All turned out delicious and in good quantity but its a tad bit overpriced. A good restaurant with good music and ambience

10 years ago Margarita's was the best tex-mex food in Singapore. They had two branches, one in East Coast Road and the other in Faber Drive. The Faber Drive restaurant was a favourite with the oil and gas community at lunchtime. They had excellent fajitas and huge "Kitchen Sink" burritos. The margaitas in Margarita's were always excellent. Sadly things have changed. Like other decent Singapore restaurants Margarita's has descended into mediocrity. These days it's not awful, but it's just typically poor value for money like too many Singaporean restaurants in 2017.Last night (5th November 2017) we visited Margarita's for my wife's birthday. We had the chimichangas and kitchen sink burritos (S$24.00). Both were noticeably smaller than they were in the old days and (I guess not surprisingly) the prices have gone up a fair bit. A single margarita was S$17.50 and my wife remarked how weak it was (could barely taste the tequila). I was driving so I opted for iced tea which was S$7.00 (for a smaller glass than I remember). I think all these prices were all "+++" too (I.e. excluding service and GST). My burrito wasn't served particularly hot and I think they were probably mass producing the popular choices - at a guess my meal had probably been sitting around for 10 or 15 minutes before it was served.Sorry Margarita's, but we won't we back. Honestly, tex-mex food is really inexpensive to prepare, and your offerings are perfectly edible, but you're serving shrunken luke-warm helpings at highish prices to customers who know better. I get it that the rent is probably high, but S$7.00 for a medium sized glass of ice-lemon tea that probably cost you 30 cents and tasteless weak diluted Margaritas is not on. On the positive side. Service - still quite OK. Parking easy

We booked a taxi for Margarita's Dempsey Hill to have dinner with my family. There were many restaurants opposite each other for different continents' food. First we orderrd - Chips and Salsa, Pith V.L.MARG for appetizer and starter, for main course- Regular Ques (Vegetarian), Chicken Adobado,Trad Ques (Chicken) and Vegetarian Puffy Tacos. But puffy tacos were not upto the mark, we were thinking that these will be crispy but found that these were soft, only presentation was unique and appealing. For desserts we placed order for Tiramisu, it was the best tastewise and appetizer was also soothing and good in taste also.. This was told to serve in wine glasses, rim was attractive with colourful salt. Ambience was mesmerizing. The outside view of Dempsy Hill was appealing and dazzling with lights
4
In the nice `Dempsey Hill area, Margarita offers all you expect from a Mexican restaurant, margarita cocktails of course (reasonably good) chorizo, fajitas, enchiladas, nachos and so on, and corona beer.The staff is very friendly, service is good and food comes fast.Price is a little bit high, but probably what one expects to pay at Dempsey Hill
4
Lovely ambience, good food albeit a bit cheesy and heavy - however it depends too on how you order. Fun times.
5
If you are fond of Mexican food it's the place you want to visit . Top of the hill . Beautiful and peaceful area . Lots of tasty variety in food and drinks .we really enjoy a lot .
5
I fell in love with this place. I love the food, service, and of course the margarita! I will definitely.
5
We visit Singapore every year and Margarita's is one of the places we head to every time. Starting with a Margarita is a must and the chilli con queso is a great start to the meal. The chicken salad is one of the best meals I've eaten , although beware it's quite large and you'll need a good appetite to be able to finish it. The burrito with prawns was also a great meal. A wonderful restaurant with great food and great service. Highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys Mexican food.
4
Good food and friendly service yet again. Must have the nachos special - delicious. The chicken burrito in the green sauce was good. Good for family get togethers as the restaurant is spacious.
4
Treat oneself to their frozen Margeritas, guacamole and salsa dips with Nachos plus their decor you feel you are in Mexico! Had their special appetiser of chilies with black beans and pastry wrap was recommended and delicious. Their beef burritos, and prawn with crispy tacos taste fine. Especially good is their chicken fajitas with caramelised onions plus tortilla accompaniments. After 2 glasses of the Margeritas one feels satisfied on a Friday evening
4
We went for dinner to Margaritas Restaurant at Dempsey Hill in Singapore to celebrate our D-in-L's birthday .It is a Mexican Restaurant in true sense .Not only food but wines, beer,even Mocatails are Mexican .I had Coronation Extra beer 4.6% alcohol by volume . Others had Margarita , what I call cocktail . Tasted It. Quite OK.We had two chicken dishes . One Margaritas chicken,do not recall the name of other one. Along with the all the dips chicken dishes were also good .Ambiance and decor of the place is excellent. Staff is polite serving with a smile.There were other three groups at least celebrating birthdays. Place was full. People seemed to be having good time.All in all worth at least one visit
5
One of the best restaurants for Mexican Food. This is because the owner is a chef himself. Excellent place for family, Friends or Business. Spacious well decorated restaurant, ideal for visitors looking for an evening away from town, though it is only 5 mins from Orchard road. Food servings are big
2
I went with friends for lunch and sadly none of us enjoyed the food. We had prawn tacos which were advertised as spicy but we're so spicy they were awful you couldn't taste the prawns or anything after eating One. The beef in the Fajitas was so chewy we had to leave it, I don't think it was the cooking I think it was just very cheap cuts of meat. The Jug of Margarita was also a bit too sweet. They do though have really nice friendly staff, which is fairly hard to come by here. I wouldn't visit again.
5
I love this place, the food is delicious. The service is very good. And the Margarita is bravo. I would like to come back again. I love the ambience and the surrounding. There are lot of cafes around and a lot of foreigner too
5
Lovely atmosphere and very good food! All from starters to main dishes were absolutely divine. Both chicken and beef dishes were üëçüèΩ
The margarita's in menu are top class!

This is my favourite Mexican restaurant in Singapore hidden away. We have been there a few times now for the lunch service and it has never disappointed. They have a range of options to please the vegetarian and gluten-free diner and the food is very fresh. The prices are reasonable and the service is very friendly and accommodating. The d√É¬©cor is how you would imagine a Mexican eatery on a film set and there is music to match. It does create a fun (if maybe a bit of a cliche atmosphere). The portions are very big so chose wisely. I last had the taco bowl salad and the sweet corn salad. Both were delicious however the portions were ginormous so if you can share with others on your table it is best to do so. You will need to drive or get a taxi here so factor that into you itinerary and overall budget, but it is worth coming out for
4
What was remarkable is the attention to details. Excellent quality and good presentation of food. Average serving time. Price was in the higher side but it didn't hurt the experience. Although it's a bar and a restaurant, music was calm and soft.

We have been fans of Margarita's since its early days when it had only one restaurant in Faber Drive. We had always felt the food was consistently excellent and the Dempsey Road location became our favourite. After not having visited in over a year our daughter decided she wanted to celebrate her birthday eating there. The staff were friendly and attentive, the atmosphere and drinks good, but the food has changed. Our usual melted cheese with chorizo starter was warm but not its usual sizzling-hot deliciousness. 4 of our 6 dishes were so spicy that 2 of them had to be abandoned by the teens eating them. We weren't a group of chili-shy eaters...my husband, who throws chili on everything, said he found his dish 'at the brink' of what he enjoys for spice. I had a bite of a quesadilla and had a mouthful of chili - aren't quesadillas traditionally the mildest option on any menu? In addition to this there was a total inconsistency of chili guidance on the menu to inform the customer - the melted cheese starter was mild for us and had one chili next to it. The inedible, fiery-hot pork and pineapple tacos also had one chili for guidance (I would recommend 4 chilis for this one!)As an additional disappointment they no longer offer the fantastic bunuelos as a dessert on their new menu. I can't help but wonder if the ownership has changed? The food certainly has. Unfortunately dining is like getting a haircut, one terrible experience and you won't return again
4
Superb Mexican food, great tasting with fresh ingredients, nicely presented too. A spacious restaurant ideal for small or large company gatherings. Don't forget to order their frozen margaritas, they are the best I have tasted
3
Great vibe, very attentive staff. Actual food was excellent, and the service warm and friendly. The biggest disappointment were the desserts which was one of the main reasons for the visit. The Tiramisu cream was melting and watery and the Churos were over fried and hardly edible. The pricing of drinks is over the top.Probably will not go back again, at least not for the desserts
5
The food was absolutely wonderful, from preparation to presentation, very pleasing !!They have good options for vegetarians and their fruit Margarita's are just as great as their name . We celebrated my husband's birthday here and they surprised us with a lovely desert at the end of our dinner which was really quite kind of them !! Overall we had a wonderful experience and will definitely come back 
4
Highly recommended. Mexican food was excellent, service top notch and the ambience and decor of the restaurant very very good. Visited with family for lunch on a Sunday but will definitely return again for dinner
5
I have been to Margarita's many times and the standard never drops. The staff are both welcoming and attentive. The food is at a very reasonable price point and always of good quality. It is great if there are just two of you or if you indeed are entertaining many; I have had as many as 20 guests, without any drop in standards. Try it once and you will be hooked
5
Wonderful place! We are here 4th time, everything is just perfect. As far as it is Mexican food, some dishes are spicy. And everything is very tasty
4
True to their name, they are experts at Margaritas. Loved the fruit flavored options in Margarita and they tasted very good. The food also was very good. Liked the Fajitas. The quesadilla were ok ( not the best but decent).But all comes with a price. This is one of the more expensive mexican restaurants
5
We celebrated my wife's birthday yesterday The food was excellent the nachos perfect I have not eaten such perfect taste nachos anywhere in Singapore I had booked the table over the phone with Mr Jack and told him it's my wife's birthdayThey gave such an excellent service and surprise with the desert to my wife I am really very happy and will recommend to go there for Mexican foodWe were vegetarian and Bob recommended perfect Vegetarian dishes Really loved it will keep visiting again and again
5
This place is amazing. We ordered the Nacho's vegeterian, a side of mexican rice, and an order of fajita. Every one of those dishes were yummy. Special compliments to the chef. I recommend this to small familys
5
visited this place multiple times and the frozen margarita was always the best! oh, and the chicken and shrimp fajitas!
1
I suddenly had a crave for Mexican food. Unfortunately many places were closed in Singapore due to a public holyday and Margarita's in Dempsey was the only one open, unfortunately for me....I arrived and was greeted by a rather arrogant waitress who quickly showed me to my table who quickly disappeared without saying anything. I sat and ordered a chili margarita ($18.50) . After a rather long wait I was served a glass with crushed ice a sweet syrup and two tiny slices of a green jalapeno that must have lost his spiciness a few years ago. Worst drink I had in ages. I looked at the menu and felt like first having an appetiser first and settled for a chile Jalapeno relleno ($24). Totally tasteless, re-fried and dripping in oil. The accompanying salsas consisted of sour cream and a tomato sauce that seemed to have been poured straight from a can. I then ordered an enchilada with beef ($19) The enchilada was one of the worst meals I've ever eaten. The tortilla was tasteless and soggy. The beef filling and the salsa had no seasoning and the whole dish tasted like it was heated up from god knows when. And it wasn't even very hot. And to complete my splendid evening , when I arrived home I had to rush to the loo....There are far better restaurants in Singapore. Don't waste your money and time in this one
5
I vegetarianed my "kitchen sink" burrito and ate past the point I knew was my fill because it tasted so good. Corona washing it back made me feel like I was dining in the Americas! Roll me to the car so I can digest this feast
4
The ambience and service was excellent. The food portion were too big but for the price it is justifiable.
5
This is located in the quaint Area where originally were the military barracks. The place is transformed & plenty of restaurants, bars & boutique shops have come up. One can spend a full day there. We tried several vegetarian starters & dishes besides 2 deserts which were all good.
3
Went there for lunch today, place was mostly empty. Food was average and we were disappointed, it was too bland to be Mexican. We ordered Fajita and Veg Chimichanga and lime and Mango drinks.They gave us free dessert too in the end which was nice.Didn't feel like authentic Mexican taste.Ambience was very good
5
Located in the hustle and bustle of Dempsey Hill, Margarita's is a restaurant well suited for a meal with friends, family or a business dinner.With extremely friendly staff and the welcoming nature of maitre d Jack and owner Andy, you can't complain much at the end of your meal.Try out the bar and the the splendid concoctions they turn out. The food is excellent and with a little help from the staff can be adjusted to suit Diabetics, Vegetarians and Vegans. Ask the staff to recommend what you like, but the lamb shank, Margarita Chicken, veal are Super choices.One thing to beat in mind, especially on the weekend is that there is a huge rush and suggest that you book well in advance. With indoor and outdoor seating, they are very accommodating. Bon Apetit
3
Some of our friends swear by this place, and whilst the food was decent enough, and indeed comes in the largest imaginable portions, they do ironically seem to be let down by the Margaritas which are almost undrinkably sweet
4
Great place - good food and good service. Been here twice but its always been a bit empty which is a bit off-putting. If you like Mexican probably one of the best places in town
5
This place used to close on odd hours to me but now open all day everyday AWESOME RacHELL & FAVIAN TOP QUALITY bar STAFFPLACE is esoteric but the experience is a cool feelFood is good however the margaritas are better evenif you are only up for a drink The Two staff mentioned above will put you right and with a smileWhich is hard to find these daysPs opposite Jones the grocer DONT GO thereoverpriced and poor service
5
Ok Singapore has so many places to eat, so many places to drink and so many places to simply hang out! Dempsey Hill is a place everyone who hangs out in Singapore knows and so is Margarita's Mexican. What is special is the waiter who served us tonight.... food is great, we know that! But the value comes from the engagement and 'Bob' is the man you want to entertain. Met him once, love the place but 'Bob' made the night. TOP class Bob. See you soon!
5
My wife and I have been searching for an authentic Mexican Restaurant since we moved here. We have been to one Mexican Restaurant, but the food didn't quite meet our expectations. Margarita's on the other hand, was a different story. As you walk in the restaurant, your greeted with true Mexican culture. The "Chapaneco Traditional Dress" displayed on the wall, the various types of Tequila and other decoy, was an awesome touch. The staff properly attended to us as they served the best, authentic Mexican food we have had since our many trips to Tijuana, MX. Albeit Margarita's is pricey... it was well worth it. I highly recommend this place.
4
I really enjoy going to this restaurant and I have been here many times. The food is always up to standard and everything taste delicious. Can't complain and would definitely recommend to anyone looking for some good Mexican food
5
We go to Margaritas quite regularly as this restaurant never disappoints you. Great service , fantastic food and the best margaritas in town. This time we had the Nachos with beef as an appetizer. Can't describe how delicious they were . Again never ordered anything which I didn't like and teh deserts are very delicious too.
5
Popped in on a whim after dropping my dog at local daycare, ordered beef nanchos which were INCREDIBLE best I've had in Singapore decor is authentically Mexican. Also Vibe reminded me of my family house in Cuba. Bar has a wide range of drinks, Rachelle the waitress was SO helpful and sweet and obviously loves working here. She made my visit by speaking about the authenticity of the place I can't wait to come back next week with my Husband
3
Mixed beef and chicken, beef was average and chicken was ok, margarita's were very good. Service was o
4
hahaha! I actually read the reviews after visiting the place. Luckily we didn't take the waiter's recommendation of the beef dish normally at $360 but special promotion at $260; said to be enough for whole table and don't need to order anything else. Anyway, we ordered the familiar chain restaurant dishes and every item was good by our non-expert Asian palate. We shared the large servings and pigged ourselves out. Total tab without drinks turned out to be lowered than expected; on the cheaper end for Dempsey
4
Our favorite Mexican place in Singapore...realizing of course this is relative. Food is good, albeit not authentic, and the margs are delicious, with several options. But, it will cost you. Service fairly good as well, and nice outdoor evening seating makes for a pleasant evening
1
My husband and I are regulars here and what brings us back time and again is the good quality mexican spread. A week ago, we called to make bookings and the person on the phone was extremely rude, almost disinterested in taking the reservation.We were in two minds about going there after the phone encounter but decided to give it another chance. Went and had a meal- before leaving, we escalated the issue politely to the manager who promised to get back with an email response.It has been 8 days since and not a sound from them. Speaks volumes about how much they care about constructive feedback and how callous they are with customers. Never setting foot there again
3
Dempsey Hill is an old barracks area which has opened up and contains lots of small eateries/bars/food outlets and other stores.It sounded a good area to visit based on a review in the Singapore Airlines magazine, but I was disappointed. A lot of the establishments look to be struggling. There was no exciting vibe to the place. Margarita's was themed to be Mexican. The food and drink was expensive, as we were warned correctly by our cab driver. I think one can do better in central Singapore
5
Fantastic jalape√±o dish, great chimichangas and frozen margaritas all round awesome environment well done
5
Very cozy restaurant, attractive decoration, friendly and helpful waiters (and they threat you as family), delicious Mexican food! Should not miss it
2
Went with the family. We were ordering our meals when the waiter recommended the Tomahawk as the best deal for us as a family. Normal price $360 but the waiter said they had it on "special" for $260. We took his advice and ordered it. Nothing wrong with the taste, but there was hardly any meat. The menu mentions 1.5kg but I bet there was no more than 250g of meat on the plate. A big bone and a pile of fat, with a few strips of meat, everyone was left hungry and we had ordered the most expensive meal on their menus, a $360 dish, albeit for the $260 special price. I travel a lot, globally, but I have never paid such money for that amount of meat. To make the experience a total disappointment we got zero service after placing our order, and the restaurant was half-empty
4
Pleasant place. Great service. Food, by Asian standards, from my experience was great. Beef tacos were very nice. Tequila lime chicken is fantastic. Highly recommend it. The other stuff was average to good. Never had Tex mex in south east asia and was very satisfied. Of course it's not like Dallas or Houston - but worth a visit. And again. The tequila lime chicken is 5 stars.
5
While waiting for my dinner mate to show up, the waiters were very kind and recommended that I tried one of the appetisers - seriously great! They were so kind and nice to me and kept asking me if I needed anything. We ordered the quesadillas and the chicken grande salad and the lamb shank. The best decisions we made.... We ate until we were bursting at the seams! Absolutely great experience! One tip though - call or book online - so many people had to wait for seats while we were there
4
Very good food and ambience is great. Love the fact that tables are not crowded. The food is always amazin
4
Recommended by my mum who lives in Singapore (one of her fave restaurants). Was not disappointed! Nachos with tasty guac, good range of the drink it's named from, yum cocktails. The food was delicious, would recommend the specials.Great ambience and lovely staff, the front of house really went out of their way to provide great service and were extremely knowledgeable of their dishes.On the dear side but good value for money. Will be back if in Singapore again
2
Lacking substantially in creditable Mexican cuisine unfortunately..
Canap√©s and entr√©es were insufficiently seasoned as well as being rather tenuously flavoured.
5
I went for my birthday in April and it was a completely amzing experince.The dining was well decorated .The dishes were filling and worth it.
I loved it and would like to go there again.
3
Mexican food is good and wholesome. We have been many times but this week were surprised by prices of drinks especially soft drinks. They charge S $36 for a small carafe of lemonade. Felt like a rip off!! Left a bad taste.
4
Nicely done up restaurant. Went for lunch on a Monday - was nice and quiet with prompt service. Food was fairly good - had burritos and tacos - were good but no signature elements. The ambience is colorful and bright.
3
Good Mexican food with cheery service. Unlike most Mexican restaurants Chips and salsa are extra. Guacamole was very good and husband liked his fajitas.
5
My husband and I just love the place and if we have any occasion to celebrate and of feel not so happy, the Margaritas at this place cheers us always up and the food is also very good. We love their desert list. so great place to go as a couple or with friends, you always find free parking, which is rare in singapore. Happy place to go and service is really nice. The owner is normally around and really ensures all runs very very smoothl
4
The colourful Mex decor, lively chatter and attentive service make this restaurant a truly cheerful & homey place to have a good hearty dinner!For a rainy Sunday night, the restaurant was fully packed (we had made reservations a week in advance for our Anniversary dinner).Highly recommend the Kitchen Sink Burrito which is the "mother of all tortilla wraps" : it had generous chunks of meat (choice of chicken, beef, pork), beans, chilli peppers, tomatoes etc topped with yummy guacamole & sour cream! I must qualify that I know I've missed other secret ingredients that go into making this really really excellent dish!!We had Chips with green salsa and Vegetable nachos for Appetisers and both surely whet the appetite- beware of the green salsa coz it's HOT and the Vegetable nachos are so nicely arranged that it was almost too regretful to eat!!For drinks, just go for the House Margarita...forget about the salt-rimmed Fruit Magaritas unless you are under 21 years old:)Finally, this review won't be complete if I didn't pay my compliments to Bob the service staff who was ever attentive (we were not invisible), made good recommendations when we enquired about the size/type of dishes for sharing, was respectful and yet friendly, taking his time to chat with us.Overall, the cheerful service and staff make for a Happy Meal (and i don't mean of the MacD's kind:)
5
I would write a lengthy review here with all the bells and whistles but the Margarita is is so good that I can't really see what I'm doing on my phone after the third jug. Beware is the salsa. It is freaking spicy.
3
We had the tacos with sour cream and condiments of onions. That never fails. But the duck confiture starter sucks. The Carne beef was not as good either. The beer slices was tender probably due to tHin slices but lacks flavour. It was saved by the 5 companying condiments. Positively the margaritas was very good, house. The strawberry margaritas was like a soft yogurt and not so nice.
5
This is a must visit vivacious restaurant with authentic Mexican food (I lived in Mexico for 5 years). However, if nothing else pay a visit to try the Graham Margarita. This is an authentic Mexican margarita with a colonial twist. Strong, bitter and and made with all fresh unsweetened lime juice. A real drink for real tequila people. Best margarita east of Cairo! On occasion the originator can be found propping up the bar (left hand corner seat
5
The food here is awesome. The Dempsey Hill outlet will allow you to suit dishes for children. The atmosphere is very authentic. I highly recommend the chicken and cheese quesadilla.Their nachos are also very good. There is a good range of vegetarian options.
4
Visited with friends. Fantastic food and ambience. Thoroughly enjoyed. Good selection of food and taste. Ice tea was not good. Need to take care of drinks taste.
5
Excellent service. Authentic Mexican. So far the best margarita in town made with all top quality tequila.
4
One of the best Margaritas I have ever tasted in my life. This place was recommended by a friend and I will visit again when ever I am in Singapore.
2
Was pushed into trying the 'mango mohito'...which is probably among the worst drinks I have ever paid for.Food was average. And the Carafe of Margarita probably had very very very little tequila in it anyway. It was dull and boring.But the d√©cor and environment was nice as always, making for excellent conversation between friends. That I must give this plaxe 
4
Our three-generation family of six meet here for a reunion with some local friends home on leave from the PRC. Margaritas proved to be a good choice. Several of us had "kitchen sink" burritos which were largish and tasty. The two teenages and one adult had desserts. Everyone expressed satisfaction with their meals. Four of us elected for Coronas to get into the Mexican mood, and the others had non-alcohol mixers. It's the cost of the booze that sends the bill up in Singapore.We dined at 7.30pm and were seated in a side space, so conversation was easily possible. Add a stereo to the usual Singapore racket and it can be off-putting. The place has a very high ceiling and a pleasant Mexican-themed decor including many intriguing paintings and portraits on the high walls. I couldn't find a "day of the dead" corner though!As the host, I picked up a bill for a total of $S356.00 ($44.50 a head) which I thought was quite reasonable all things considered (don't forget the service charges and taxes in Singapore)
3
DinnerFood was average. Nacho's didn't impress, overly sauced for my taste (BBQ Sauce?), wasn't cheesy and guacamole was average. However, the mains were pretty good. We ordered the Chimichangas, beef and pork had good flavour. Salsa was average as well.Service was good. Margaritas were decent. The restaurant itself had a rustic mexican/tuscan feel to it, which is a good thing. Price.......this is where it pulled everything down to a average rating. Its too pricey for the standard of food the place is serving
1
We had nachos for starter and tomahawk for main , 3 glasses of red wine and 1 pitcher of margarita for 4 persons....bill came up to more than $615 ???? This is not even a Michelin star restaurant or close to it. Speechless and shocked that a family restaurant will charge more than $150 dollars a head with nachos and tomahawk ???? Are we in Switzerland ??? This is absolutely crazy and I think it's only right that I share this experience with everyone. Utterly shocked and ripped off.Even the best steakhouse in town like Bedrock or Four Seasons Hotel doesnt charge $ 360 for a tomahawk! My grouse is the lack of transparency. The staff that attended to us recommended the tomahawk but conveniently ommitted mentioning the hefty price tag. It's shocking to be slapped with such a bill! Will never go back again
5
It was my first ‚Äì and definitely will not be my last ‚Äì visit to this vibrant bistro. Situated beautifully at Dempsey Hill, everything just felt right ‚Äì perfect taste, lovely deco/paintings, great service by both the owners & staff.We started by dipping into the Nachos! Mmmhh it was finger-licking good! The nachos, the avocado puree, the black beans, the cheese etc just blended and melt perfectly in your mouth!We continued our sumptuous journey with Carne Asada ‚Äì basically seasoned beef grilled and served as slices. It‚Äôs like DIY thing like Fajita ‚Äì with the more original Mexican recipe while fajita has been more suited to American taste - you fill your tortilla with the meat & condiment then wauhmm. Mannn, now it‚Äôs the perfect timing to say we had the foodgasm of the nite! (tips: ask for medium / medium-rare ‚Äì the tender-juicy meat satisfying your tongue is so worth it!).The sweet desserts to end our perfect nite were Tres Leches & Churros. I loved both. The Churros soft and warm with just the right amount of the brown sugar sprinkled all over which to make it perfect you‚Äôve got to dip it into the choco sauce prepared on the center.The Tres Leches ‚Äì Mexican sponge/butter cake ‚Äì it has the creamy soft lovely texture & of course nice taste. It was amazing how passionate the owner, Hendy, about the food and everything. He took time to share things to us about the food and drink even a bit of the cultural story. He and his wife were very hands on & attentive to the food quality and the whole operation even serving the customers themselves. The staff were very friendly too and the manager checked how we were doing.Have I mentioned the Margaritha drink was just as fantastic?Lovely night. Definitely will come back again

I use to love Margarita's especially when it was at Faber Driver and the owner would come out and make every single customer feel extraordinary special. Service is still very good and the waiter was excellent. D√©cor is also really nice. However I had the crab enchilada which really is too cheesy and the refried beans and gone too watery. This was not the case in the past
4
I love this place for food and ambience. Perfect place to go out with friends for the mexican bite along with margaritas .
4
We didn't try their food and only tried some of their drinks. Had a good time in here. The place wasn't so crowded and quick service.
4
Great location, great service! The food and drinks were both very good. My Singapore friends vouch for this place
4
A high price to pay for some good food. The menu is good and the ambiance is nice. They have space for outdoor seating also.

I like Dempsey Hill Margaritas had a nice buzz about it which for me is very important. The food though I am sorry to say is pretty average and not good enough for the price paid. A Friend had the pork which was pretty dry I had a steak good size for a child the best dish on our table was the chicken salad which did look magnificent.
3
Went there with two grown ups and one kid. Had the carni asada some tortilla chips, water and pincher of frozen margarita. Total over SGD 170. Apparently the pincher was SGD 76...We loved the meat platter, but too little tortillas served w it. So we ordered some extra.Ok food but not worth the money you pay.

I have been looking for a depth in flavors since few months and the buck stopped at Margarita's!It was our first visit, we got down at Orchard mrt and took 77 bus. We followed Google maps but Margarita‚Äôs is incorrectly pinned there. We had to call the restaurant to find our way. It is located at Blk 11 at Dempsey Hill. But once you reach there, you know the journey was worth it. May be the restaurant can look at putting proper signage to avoid such incidents. I am sure, we will not be the only one. (After reaching at Margarita‚Äôs, I checked maps again and it showed 300 m away)The place was full. Ambience was appealing. For once I thought we should have made a reservation but the servers were more than helpful. He was very courteous. We could see his efforts in getting a table for us, and we got one quickly!The pink menu card catches your eyes. Mango Margarita was just perfect. Tequila in it was premium, we could feel it. The best part was the Nachos and Tacos. We repeated Nachos. Chips were thin, cripy, proportion was perfect, presentation was ok and we finished the dish in no time. The first bite gave me the flavors that I was looking for few months. Very savoury! Even the Browie had a distinct texture.The restaurant has high ceiling, rustic appearance, brown walls with lots of paintings hanging around. The bar counter is elaborate and impressive. Servers were happy and quick. Food was good but tad expensive. Crowd was good. We had a good time! Surely coming back

Best reservation system with very helpful thought in the mind managed by Mr Jack, such a popular restaurant has been taken wonderful care of by Jack.. All the staff are cheerful and try their level best to assist. Fantastically considerate service from Manu who is able to impress me whom am also from hospitality industry. Food has been consistently delicious, I'm not able to name a single dish that us disappointing, we'd certainly patronize Margaritas very often.. Thank you for being a place where we are looking forward to enjoy pleasant meals each & every time, see you all guys soon again
3
This is a fun place to go have a drink. They definitely make it enjoyable with a large variety of drinks,and the place is just fun. The food seemed average to me (I am from Mexico, so my standards for mexican food are high), but if you feel like tex-mex its ok
4
The place has a nice vibe to it,definitely not a very Mexican vibe but still decent for dining at the Dempsey Hills.The food was good and they had good enough options for my vegetarian family and mind you the portions are big so be careful while ordering.I really loved their Nachos and Enchiladas.The service is a little less happy and they are in a hurry to close the table for service which is quite weird. The Tres Leches is also pretty good
4
Great service, food was delicious and loved they variety of margarita cocktail flavours available! Nice atmosphere and will surely go back.
4
We had a great time enjoying the flavorful margarita drinks, mango and passion fruit. The tacos were not quite the original Mexican style, but still tasty and spicy. We'll come back for more.
4
I highly recommend trying their frozen Margaritas. They are simply awesome! Only had one! It was Sunday :-)Had really good nachos as a starter. Nice big portion and great taste. Lots of stuff on the top. Glad I shared it though - otherwise I could not have eaten the next course :-)Tried the buritos for mains. Equally good!The staff was really friendly, smiling and very attentive. Constantly checking up to see if we needed anything.All in all one of the better Mexican restaurants I have been to. Next time I am coming back on a Friday or a Saturday!
4
Overall, a pleasant experience. A bit too noisy, and very fast paced. Drinks were great - and the food was delicious - portions are of good size. Service can definitely be improved to cater to the busy restaurant. All the dips are delicious and so are the main meals - quesadillas, fajitas, burritos, enchiladas are perfect!

Visited the place with my wife, two children (all Thai nationals) and a close family friend, for lunch.Were seated outside because indoor was full. Waited a (too long) while to be able to order a drink while we checking out the (very small) menu for our lunch. Eventually the cold drinks were served, but the beer was not cold enough for the temperature outside and the cappuccino was served quite some time later. The meal was served and was quite nice actually. After our lunch my wife excused herself to go to the toilet only to return again to the table advising us that she was told that there was no toilet in the restaurant. I stood up and walked around a few "barracks" to see if I could find a public toilet. Upon my return it appeared that a toilet was available within the restaurant, but a senior staff member would not allow my wife to go there.We raised our concerns about this to "management" and he apologize to my friend, but not to my wife. The staff member who refused her access to the toilet did not come out to apologize to my wife. needless to say we will not go to this restaurant again and will not recommend it to any others
4
Margaritas is one of those places where you can come with friends or family its always a good experience. Friendly staff.. Happy people.. Good food and ofcourse margaritas!!Its a place i keep coming back to for the ambience... For the drinks.. For the food.Recommended for a Friday anytime!
3
This was our second time going to Margarita's. We were seated in a dark restaurant (much darker than your usual restaurant) and ordered some nachos and burritos. They gave us very generous portions but the food was very filling so we couldn't finish it all! The filling inside the wraps were tasty, but nothing to go on about. One of the dishes I liked was probably the cheesy nachos with salad - they went well together.Margarita's is a good restaurant, but nothing to go on about. The food is tasty, but nothing fantastic. However, I still enjoyed my meal there
2
Mexican food, it gets crowded inside d restaurant, we went on wednsday night. Crowd s ok since it is a large place. The service was really good, ontime and attentive. However the food lacked flavoutlr we all thought. It was bland. We ordered from nachos to chimi changa tacos a big variety. Most dishes jad this problem. However. The deseertswe ordered was spectacular and we thoroughly enjoyed the dessert - brownies n choc cakes with ice cream.lovely
5
Having enjoyed Mexican fare in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico some time back, I can say that what Margarita's offer on classy Dempsey Hill is as authentic as it can get! I was therefore not surprised to find myself with family and kids at this colourful fun place which captures the ambience and atmosphere of Mexico so very truly! The Nachos were mouth watering and so was the Soup of the day last weekend we were there. On a bright sunny Saturday this cool place was truly cool! Sure to go back sometime soon
5
Finally, after years in Hong Kong and more than a year in Singapore, found a good Mexican restaurant. The guacamole was great. The chicken burrito and snapper were also very good. The tortilla soup was fantastic. It's a bit pricey, but then again it's Mexican food in Asia. I don't need my Mexican food fix when I visit the USA this summer quite as much now.
5
I always look forward to going here since the food and service is perfect. Never had a bad dining experience here and its always nice to go back
5
We popped into Maragritas on a whim and was very pleasantly surprised. We had excellent food but the service is what stands out. It was very "western feeling" compared to most establishments around here. We even got free water! Definitely will be back!
4
Went for a school re-union here on a sat nite. We are vegetarians, so can recommend the nachos, grilled burritos, jalapeno poppers and fajitas. the non veggies on our table raved about a fish and another chicken dish, but not sure which ones they were exactly. Overall Good Ambience and Good foo
3
The beverages where typical Mexican and even had the famous Mexican coke!! The starter was great we had queso fundido with authentic Oaxaca cheese from Mexico very traditional however when the enchiladas came to shine they were quite disappointing the flour tortillas where bought ones as you can find them at any supermarket, which for a real Mexican have a tex Mex taste same with the sauces that came straight out of the tube and where decorated with some fresh cut onions. Suggested for a appetizer with some small nachos to share or queso fundido but not for a memorable dinning experience. Will go back for the service but not the main courses.
5
Margerita's is really a very good place for eating. It's ambiance is very good. Its location is very nice. All around top foreign restaurants are there.Good crowd u find in that area. Staff is very polite and knowledgeable. We ate only veg food but they prepare the same very tasty. For vegetarians this can be a good option . If u r young and want to taste different types of food variety then this is also a best option for some change. You have to forgot weight loss program when you eat here. Overall I was very much satisfy with the restaurant
5
We've been to Margaritas many times and have enjoyed the food. But last night I ordered chicken enchiladas and they were way too hot (spicy). I'm from Southern California, where we have lots of Mexican food, but ayyiyiyi! That was hot! The good news is that when I mentioned this to my waiter, Manu, I had another plate of less spicy chicken enchiladas on the table in less than 5 minutes! Excellent attentive service from our waiter, Manu. I'll be back. Get the pitcher of margaritas, better value if you're going to have two margaritas each (dining for two). Fajitas also recommended.
4
I had always imagined a life of indolence sipping Margaritas by the poolside without having the foggiest what a Margarita was. So we decided to go to the restaurant by the same name just to try out what the drink was. And were we disappointed? No not at all. It was a bright space with colourful paintings all the way to the top, loud music and happy diners. We had gone for brunch and had to reserve in advance as this place is quite popular and we didn't want to be turned away considering we were with a baby.Since I'm not an expert on Mexican food, I enjoyed it, particularly the vegetarian quesedillas. The chicken enchiladas were yum, the beef fajitas passable ( I don't like to assemble my food on the table), the fired ice cream and chilli ice cream were revelations but didn't really appeal to my palate.The service was great but the downside was that unlike most places in Singapore, this rest room had no place to either feed a baby or change the nappy.....
4
First off, this is some of the best Mexican you can find in Singapore. I personally enjoyed more the original restaurant which was near Jurong, it was very kitsch, and "felt" a bit more authentic. Many of the ingredients and sauces are sourced from Mexico, so there are authentic flavours, but sometimes it feels more "enhanced" than traditional Mexican. But, it's very good. The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars are the prices. Mexican is one of the cheaper cuisines to make in the world, and doesn't need SGD40+ prices for mains. Add in SGD20++ prices for a margarita, and you're up for a reasonable bill. But once in a while, well worth a visit.
4
If you love Mexican food with good ambience with space. This is a great place. Located at Dempsey hills gives you that feeling of in a country side. Looking around 50Sin$/person if you go with 2 or 3 for a starter to share, drink and a main dish. Highly recommend to go as got a good men

It was one of those wet Sundays when the rain could spoil the day. We visited the restaurant for a late lunch. The greeting was warm and we had soon ordered with the minimum of fuss. The pre meal drinks didn't disappoint especially the restaurant‚Äôs namesake. The salsa starter we ordered just had the right amount of bite. The food arrived pretty quickly and was good Mexican fare, pleasant and tasty but with enough bite (although the jalape√±o side dish was a great addition and idea). Service was excellent, attentive yet unobtrusive. There were a cross section of diners from young couples, families with children and even a whole table of teenage girls.Good value for money, good food and we will be back
4
one of my favourite dining places in Singapore. The margaritas are great. Lovely mexican food. The service is quite good. Overall a very nice place for an evening meal
4
The food and the drinks are really great. The service is OK but could be better. The restaurant itself is fine with reasonable furniture. A bit noisy, but hey ... with their drinks you can't complain!
4
I didn't order much other than Nachos, Chicken Fajitas & desserts. They were great tasting so we had no regrets.
The ambience is amazing! Really bowled over by the setting as it is cosy & welcoming. Service is excellent too!
4
If you are looking for reasonably good Mexican food, this is a good option. A bit pricey but the atmosphere is nice.
3
The pitcher of margaritas was very good. Disappointed by the nachos. . Food was acceptable but it was very expensive!
4
A relaxed atmosphere with a big menu and great cocktails. Certainly a nice experience - and not super expensive. Worth a try for a group of people :)
5
I first visited this restaurant 10 years ago and here I am back on 2016 New Year's dinner. The ambience is as good as ever, and the food is excellent with a huge portion. Particularly loved the dessert - brownie with ice-cream. The service crew is all attentive and polite. Would definitely come back again.
4
The service is very good as the staff are able to customise vegetarian dishes to our liking. They usually accommodate bookings and make seating arrangements although they have a busy patronage. Somehow, Indians seem to love Mexican food and this place seems to be a favorite for Indians. Food orders come in fast and they do not rush you to vacate your seats.Parking seems to be available most of the time

Magarita's @ Faber had always been one of our favorite restaurants. A small and cozy restaurant with good service. N most importantly good food. We went to their Demsey road outlet for the first time this month. The restaurant is huge. And I can see that they try to cramp in as many tables as possible....such that it becomes rather uncomfortable. Food was still decent. But the disappointment came in the service. Once we ordered our food, service was basically not existence. Food was served before the drinks. And we need to remind them three times of our additional order of wraps and chips. By the time they served the wraps, the meat were all cold. One male waiter even banged the food serving on our table without apologizing. Really really rude. We were really disappointed with the overall dining experience....probably our last visit to one of our favorite restaurants.
4
Had dinner Friday night and ordered a frozen strawberry margarita to start. Flavor was good: sometimes frozen drinks can taste a little weak or bland, but this one had a nice tart strawberry flavor. We had the chili con queso dip which we didn't like so much because it had an unfamiliar flavor we weren't expecting from a cheese dip. Will probably avoid that in the future. For my entr√©e, I decided to try their signature dish, crab enchiladas. It came with some rice, a small salad, and black beans. The enchiladas were quite good, especially when accented with jalape√±o peppers. For dessert I had a special seasonal dessert of grilled pineapple with coconut ice cream and a Mexican wedding cookie. The pineapple was outstanding
4
Good mexican food. They have a few outlets I frequently visit, the Dempsey one has the best ambience. Food is good but a bit overpriced.
5
The carnitas were very good as were the margaritas. I very highly recommend if you need a fix of Mexican food. Very good place.
4
The kitchen sink burrito is fantastic. Be warned though - its huge! The fizzy drinks are refreshing and worth a try.
3
Easy and relaxing place to go with family... located at Dempsey hill, this Mexican diner is just perfect fit for those want to have relaxing dinner with family or big groups. Maybe not so special, but useful restaurant.
5
It has been 10 years and still the food standard has maintained and never failed us. We missed the outlet at Faber House which was closed but this one at Dempsey is as good.We introduced this restaurant to my mother-in-law and she simply loved all the dishes we ordered especially lamb shank and portebello mushroom which has been our favourite. The stuff fish and the christmas soup is awesome too.It's great to see the boss around where he mingled with the customers to ensure we are happy with the experience
5
Went for a meal here with friends who had eaten here before. We were not disappointed. Lovely Margarita's whilst sitting at the bar, then sat down to eat a tasty and plentiful table of food. Lovely atmosphere, obviously enhanced by being with good friends and several cocktails. Most enjoyable
3
Visited this place with friends. On the whole, the setting and ambiance is quite pleasant. We sat in the outdoor area to avoid the noise and have a better conversation. We ordered Quesadillas, Tacos and Chimichangas. The food was generally good but I found it to be a little bland in flavor. Service is good overall, however, additional orders may take long.Dont miss the desserts :)A good option for a casual day out with friends
5
Visited the Dempsey restaurant over the weekend for my birthday treat and I was in for a surprise. I have always been a great fan of Mexican food but I did not expect to find such a nice place in the middle of town.   Perhaps the most important part of a Mexican restaurant for me is the salsa and the pot served in Margarita's was delicious. Freshly made and spiced just right to tickle your taste buds, so much so i had to finish every last chip on the table (it's my birthday so that's okay...right?). The enchiladas we ordered was tasty but a word of caution - eat it fast or it'll diminish quick in quality. Portions are also generous and if you're a table full of ladies, do consider sharing. Special thumbs up for the lime margarita (duh, it's Magarita's).   Another thing to note was the decor. Understood from the owners that all the paintings were handpicked from Mexico and there is even a flower painting by the Mexican ambassador's wife (have fun trying to spot it!). Love the amount of thought placed into the whole atmosphere and I will definitely visit this feisty find again
5
We went here just for the dessert, which is a must have ...no matter where you eat at Dempsey Hill. We ordered Kahlua Tiramisu, the mere look of it is enough to make you swoon. 1 order was enough for 3 of us. The interiors were quaint and lovely. Wish it would stay open all day at least for the drinks and desert
5
The food was great, tasty and well presented. The portions were adequate, sufficient to share some dishes. The beef fajita was excellent and so was the beef quesadilla my granddaughter ordered, we had to help her finish the dish. The pitcher of 5 glasses is served to fill smaller glasses, not USA size glasses. We had a good meal and enjoyed the evening out with our granddaughter
4
Thumbs up: Polite/helpful staff, large portions, location. Thumbs down: Average taste, slow service, only serve without AC between 3.30 PM and dinner time.
3
The food is good and they have a good selection. Service is not the best especially for the price you pay. Portions are small especially if you get beans or rice with your meal. There are much better Mexican food places in Singapore.
4
I visited this place so many time in the past several years. The service in a bit better for Singapore std. The foods and drinks I have tried was always very good here.
4
When in doubt, go to Margarita's. They undoubtedly have the best Mexican food in Singapore. They atmosphere is lively and enthusiastic. The staff is amazing and super friendly. They location is absolutely perfect. Great place for family, friends, kids, couples.
4
We had gone there for dinner and I admit we had a great time. We were seated on the outside and the beautiful weather only made it more enjoyable. They have a wonderful and friendly staff. We were completely sold on their nachos and kept ordering those again and again. They serve the nachos with a special 'fingerlicious' in-house made dip. You should visit this place. It is nice.Thereafter don'r forget to eat ben and jerry ice cream right opposite the street
4
Best place to be is at the bar , where you can get very attentive service, great margaritas. You can walk in. There is usually room . The staff is very friendly and well trained . The carnitas were excellent . Good nachos. Salsa should be spicier with more cilantro in my view.. The menu offers in fact an amazing array of choices. Impeccable margaritas
4
The place is a nice joint if your looking for some fancy cocktails to go with some great Mexican delicacies. The prices are in the upper side, but strictly average going by Singapore standards. Overall the ambience at Dempsey Hill is quite happening for a for time visitor !
2
Welcoming smiles were nice and therefore we went in. The menu was quite narrow but we were still able to find something to eat. We ordered Corona beer and nachos to start with. The nachos came but not the beers. When re-asked for them it became clear that they were warm. How about San Miguel? Ok. The nachos were not crispy. The mains were totally out of balance. The amount of chicken was ok but just two spoons of the bean paste and very limited amount of salad to put inside the tortilla. The waitress said that they were side orders. Would you like to order some more? No thanks. The bill (one plate of nachos, the mains and three beers) altogether with taxes SGD 155. Not worth of visit. There seems to be just one good restaurant in Dempsey Hill area and that's the seafood restaurant Long Beach.
5
Early supper on Saturday and arrived with out a booking but were not disappointed, the staff at Margaritas were accommodating as long as we were out by a certain time. The food and service were exceptional you can not go wrong add in a great cocktail and a good glass of wine with the company and its an excellent place for dinner. We keep going back and are not disappointed even though to like our tried and tested but have become a little more adventurous with there great selection. Do yourselves a favor make a booking so not to be disappointed the traffic through Margaritas trying to get a table is amazing. We will be back again and again
3
I personally did not enjoy the food very much. There was a very limited number of dishes for vegetarians and the helpings were very small, taking into account the over the top prices. It was dark inside and a bit too gloomy for a Sunday lunch. Truthfully speaking only enjoyed the nachos
5
just the place for italian cuisine, we loved the margarita pizza with various choices of toppings accompanied with interesting flavoured soups
5
A very good Mexican restaurant option at the beautiful Dempsey Hill area... the standard dishes are great and the chilli beer (Corona with Tabasco or jalape√±o) is really amazing. Indoor & outdoor seating options are there. Casual & nice.
4
we have been to margarita's at faber estate, and dempsey road a number of times. the quality of food as usual is excellent, delicious.service staff, polite, helpful and knowledgeable about vegetarian options.
5
Stepped into a restaurant with a wonderful Mexican atmosphere decorated with paintings that served delectable Mexican food & beverages such as burritos, fajitas, nachos, enchiladas, jarritos, virgin margaritas & many more!
3
Didnt find the place a great authentic mexican job with anything. It was very average food - although its not that difficult to get mexican food right!
1
Insulting to pay so much for cheap drinks and cheap ingredients. Wine was bad, magaritas used cheap pre-mix and nachos used movie theatre cheese sauce, at over $20++ i'd expect more. At the prices they charge here ($250 + tip for 2 people incl 1 starter, 2 mains and 4 drinks) they are blatantly insulting the customer by giving them cheap ingredients and maximising their profit. Vote with your feet
4
very good restaurant, good service and nice margaritas.After living abroad couple of years I got used to bad mexican places, but this one is really good as it does two things:- Good micheladas (which is not common outside of mexico)- They use corn tortilas for enchiladas verdes. Most of restaurants use flour when they do this dish...which is awfulFor this two reasons I qualify this place as pretty good if you are looking for real mexican foo
4
Was a bit concerned about the reviews on bad service but found it to be totally untrue.Arrived at 6pm on a weekday evening and found that there were already a few tables of guests.Service and food was good with nice ambience (a bit dark). Some of the chairs looked like they came from the old shop at Clementi. It was a tad expensive but would go again on special occasions
3
I know I should not be complaining about pricing in Singapore, I get it, its expensive. But the price does not equate value here. It is the closest tasting Tex-Mex you can get, but prices range from 18-35 sgd. Mexican food is the food that is on the economical side of dining. $48 sing for a 1/2 carafe Margarita?? NO thanks. Decor is very festive and bright, only can tell during the day, as when its night the lights are really low. Staff is friendly and very helpful. Never have had a complaint
3
If you have been in Singapore for a while, still can go to other place, Small portions, when you order Guacamole, or Pico de gallo, small portions for Beef Fajitas, Margaritas tequila its not a good quality, I found the place to be expensive, but then again we are in Singapore, still you could get a bit more for the cost,
3
Good Mexican food with great tasting! Too bad it expensive. Nice atmosphere and surroundings, great margaritas. Waiters could pay a little more attention to the guests.
3
Tough to find good tex-med in Singapore, and this place does not have it. Expensive, normal mexican food.
5
Love coming here whenever I'm craving mexican, compared to Singapore food prices it is expensive but because I'm from Australia I find it reasonable
The chicken fajitas are beyond amazing! Highly recommend them, the decor is lovely and just an overall good experience
4
Good quality food.
Fast & quality service.
Great cocktails too!
Don't hesitate to ask for the special main courses which are not on the menu...and the waiters know exactly how they are made...a good sell!!!
5
i have been going here for years with family&friends and it has never dispointed the food and drinks here are always great! the best Mexican i have had in Singapore!
4
Went yesterday for my birthday dinner as suggested by one of my friend ans not disappointed at all. Very nice place and good food, though i have eaten better maxican in other places. The place doesn't seems like its in singapore. Very nice location and calm and quiet. We ordered nachos, beers, fajitas, Margarita Chicken. Nachos was ok, chichen was very good. Fajitas are ok. Service and looks are the best thing about ghe place. Price is ok.I would for sure recommend for a romantic and lovely dinner. Make sure you book a table beforehand
4
One of the better Mexican restaurants in Singapore, although a tad over-priced its definitely worth a visit if you're about in Dempsey area. The food is always fresh and of good quality and the kitchen sink burrito is MASSIVE! Fajitas not great though sadly so stick with the tacos and burritos/enchiladas
5
I am from California and so am really picky about good Mexican food, this restaurant is reminiscent of some I used to go too when i lived there, the portions are generous and the food is delicious. My friends all had their margaritas and said they were top notch, would definitely recommend
2
Even with a $200 bill when we asked for another helping of condiments for our fajitas were told we would be charged $6, after which the owner explained charge was because the price of his "high quality" ingredients had gone up. Translation - customer you pay for my higher costs. And he wasn't even embarrassed to say that to us. Wow! Just remember there are many new Mexican restaurants in Singapore so don't settle for this type of approach and we in Singapore pride ourselves for being great in terms of service
3
Was ok Mexican, advertized local Mexican beer, but when we asked they said haven't had Mexican other than Corona for a while. Food was ok, but way over priced for Meat and Tortilla's, many other places are way better. Service was good but wouldn't bother coming back
4
This was my second visit here. Nice restaurant up in Dempsey Hill, with a nice outside terrace. It is expensive, but then that is my impression of most of Singapore! Menus are brought and orders taken quickly. The margaritas are as good as you would hope for in a Mexican restaurant! The guacamole started was good - only a small portion of chips is supplied but they will bring you more. The burritos and the fajitas were pretty tasty, but they arrived far too quickly after the starter - we need time to digest please! The consequence of filling us up too quickly is that we can't consume any more food or drinks! Slow down and let your guests enjoy it more (and they will probably spend more!
5
Went to Margarita's with my husband on first day of CNY for dinner. The restaurant looked quite full and we were sort of worried since we had no reservation, however, a staff welcomed us with a warm smile and immediately brought us a table. All staff came to us is very friendly and all of them know the menu really well, food and wine taste great and we enjoyed the dessert recommended by restaurant.We'll certainly come back to Margarita's, hopefully can get a table there :
5
When for husband birthday dinner , love the service special from an Indian guy with spectacles, great welcome and feel comfortable with the way that he talk and introduce the item( 1st trying , so need help). Food are nice and big portions. Will came again for that fantastic service and food .
3
In comparison to other Mexican restaurants in Singapore it can be safely said: the food is decent but definitely not the best and taking the prices into consideration, there are better options. The guacamole that comes with the nachos for example is half the size as in other places and tastes artificial. Although the staff is very friendly, it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s obvious that they are more in for the money then the qualit
5
We were introduced to Margaritas by our friends when we visited Singapore in 2008. And ever since then we have been regulars (at least once in 2 months). Service is great, we love their margaritas and our standard fare are the nachos and quesidillas - we are vegetarian. Ambience is authentic and there is always a buzz around the place.We have tried many other dishes (chimichanga, enchiladas etc) and have brought our whole family here as well as our friends and we keep coming back. Prices are on the higher end. But if you have not tried it you must
3
The usual spot I come to for family dinners when we are craving some Mexican food. My favourite dish would have to be the breaded jalapenos stuffed with cheese. The margaritas are good but not one of the best that I have tried. For mains I would recommend the enchiladas. I have tried the fajitas once but found that they weren't that great. The service was good but when its busy it gets kind of slow
4
Food quality and quantity were very good. Food was delivered fairly fast, although the restaurant was about 90% full at that time. Staff was caring enough to come back and ask how the food was. Price was towards higher end of the expected range. Environment was nice and space between tables was reasonable
3
We visited Margarita's for dinner with a party of 7 - three generations of our family, ages ranging from 60s to 2yrs old.This was my second visit here and it must be said on both occasions the place wasn't full... (just saying)Service was alright, waiters were polite, knew about the dishes and seemed to try.So I'd say a 6.5 to 7/10 for service.The food was jothing to wrute home about at all.... it was edible but barely memorable... maybe with except of the mushroom mains - that seemed to have a little more effort and thought put into it. So i'd give that a 5.5. - 6/10Ambiance is nice.... well decorated, spaceous, relaxing... even romatic if you want. So I'd give that a 7/10 too All in all it was 'NICE' - ...because the food could be better

I am reviewing compared to the Mexican food we get in singapore. If I would compare it with the Mexican food in America, I would have given even zero stars. The ambience is good, food is average, service is poor. We were ordering nachos for my 10 year old (they come with tomatoes, lettuce, beans and cheese). The over smart tall Indian waiter, without being asked, advised that kids usually get only cheese on the nachos and leave out the rest of the veggies and beans and we should do the same. Thanks to him ( I am being sarcastic here), my son who was tired and usually eats veggies liked his stupid idea and insisted on cheese only nachos. These cost the same $18 but without the good stuff. I ordered a chipotle fish tortilla which had a slight drizzle of chipotle when it came to the table. Asking for more chipotle sauce, I was told it would be charged as a side. It came in a kids one scoop ice cream size cup and was charged at $6 - ridiculous ! What will they charge next- a side of Tabasco; a side of chilli flakes ? It should have been given in a smaller portion and either not charged at all or charged $1 max. Is the owner listening ? Anyway, I will not be going there again. Staff is not properly trained

Nice but there are better places if you want Mexican food. The menu was what you would expect and food done to a good standard. Nice range of frozen margaritas . Dempsey Hill has tons of restaurants and generally a good atmosphere here. No complaints just Nothing out if the ordinary
4
Service was very quick which was appreciated because we had a hungry 5year old. Food was tasty but quite expensive. Pleasant surroundings not noisy. Enjoyable evening.

A casual place for texmex, margaritas with friends and colleagues. Well prepared food, generous pitchers of margarita and good service have made us spend the "last night with the gang" in Singapore here for the last 6 years.
4
Enjoyable. Chili beer with jalapeno is something to try out. We went in without reservation 21:00 plus, and we knew we were lucky that we found a table. Pretty lively atmosphere.
4
Lovely atmospheric restaurant with good mexican food. A little pricy but great service which make it worth it. Preparation and presentation of food was excellent
3
Have been here on several occasions but always felt it painful to pay the bill compared with the quality of food we had.
There are better Mexican places in town at not so "dempsey' prices.....like Chilis.
3
I went here on a Sunday night for dinner and although the stuffed peppers along with the nachos were amazing, I did leave feeling that I could have put 100 dollars to better use. Cannot complain about the quality of the food at all. The guacamole was really on point and the quesedillas were great as well.An opportunity for improvement could lie in the service. Despite being extremely polite, I felt like I had to repeat my requests on 3 occasions for something as simple as tap water. A good meal but probably will be a one time visit only
4
I came here with my colleagues and working partners after a gruesome day of workshop. The atmosphere is nice, the waiters were very attentive and generally a good place to chill and relax. We ordered the set menu with starters (nachos + quesadilla) & desserts (choc cake with ice cream) to share and of course we ordered (each) our own main meal. The meal is extremely huge and frankly speaking, I didn't finish mine. I ordered the beef fajitas (didn't manage to snap a pix of it) and my colleague who sat next to me ordered the chicken fajitas. There were 2 other main course to be ordered but it didn't really look appetizing to us (1 fish & another chicken). Anyway, for those who can eat a lot, this is the place to come. We wanted to order the margaritas but decided not to because we were all too tired; we ordered the peach & lemon drink instead. I didn't really like it because it was just too sweet. Service is good and personally, the experience is memorable & I would come again.The location of this is place is about 10-15mins drive from Great World Shopping Center & every taxi driver knows this place. There are also other restaurants located within the vicinity so, I may just check out some other restaurants later

You can tell when a restaurant owner's passion is in gastronomy or profit. Here, it's definitely the latter! The food is decent, but the dishes are not all that varied in terms of cooking style, and there is minimal use of fresh produce - cheaper to run that way! Drinks are more impressive. Prices are high, especially for the cocktails. The commercialistic orientation of the bosses spills on the attitude of the female staff, who are generally absent, except they're keen to clear half-eaten dishes so they can check if guests have added a tip to the service charge!

Managed to book a table after my third try on a Saturday evening . Food portions were generous . For small eaters, a rack of ribs will definitely have to be shared . Tortilla wrap was thin, and fillings were generous . The "no sugar " tiramisu was very smooth and creamy and is great for those who do not like their desserts to be too sweet. The "burnt milk " dessert served with ice cream made In-house, was unusual - not easy to stop at just one bite !
4
Food here was one of the best Mexican's I've had in Singapore. Starters and main courses are massive. Had the beef fajita's and lesson learned (more than enough for two hungry people) Nice ambience in the restaurant. We ate outside which is OK. Downside was the overpriced jug of Margarita's. I think 76 dollars and this could be before tax was served outside to us so was'nt long before it was a slushy mess. This is a point that should be addressed. Will return for sure but won't pay that outrageous amount for a jug of Margarita
3
Pretty family friendly restaurant with a good option for kids, and a relaxed atmosphere. Larger starter portions so perhaps 1 to share, and overall pretty reasonable food. Mango daiquiri was however really good
2
Extortionate prices ($200 for two for lunch including a beer and two margaritas each) for decidedly average to sub-par food. Bland, stodgy, over-priced and far from authentic Mexican food. Also, not mentioned on the website, but closes between 3 and 6pm (at least on a Sunday)
4
Been to this restaurant a few times. Most of the food that I have eaten have been good. The service has been friendly but slow sometimes. I got the feeling that sometimes I was eating pre fabricated food. The Guacamole can be better though. Drinks are very pricey and it is better to drink up at home before you get to the hotel. Overall, a good but costly experienc
5
Spontaneous visit with party of nine during the week. Immediately greeted by very friendly staff who organized nice table outside. Well managed, all were attentive, prompt with the orders, fast service and good care of the kids. The jug of Margarita was excellent, not diluted as in some other places. We ordered the whole variety of dishes and all were very good with different degrees of spicyness. This place has been there "forever", they know their thing, reliably and consistently. A good reference point for Singapore
5
Used to live in Singapore and would go to Margarita's East Coast Road at least every month or two. Best Mexican food and Margarita's (by the jug S$76 but hmmmm) our family has had. After 5 years was back in Singapore for a few weeks and it was JUST AS GOOD
5
Had been here last time I was in Singapore & couldn't avoid a repeat this June either! The high roof, the ambience, the table settings, the lighting, the mouthwatering Tacos...what do I put on TOP of my list of reasons for wanting to come back again
3
Margarita's has a pretty good bar scene, with a decent crowd there most nights. But the food is pretty generic, with the exception of a couple of appetizers. Tried the Chimichanga recently which was quite soggy with no flavor. Food-wise, I much prefer La Salsa, two doors down from Margarita's, though it is less atmospheric than Margarita's. They certainly make a killer Chimichanga
4
Best Mexican food in Singapore!I had dislocated my knee and was on crutches when i went to Margarita's for dinner. They gave me a table right away and allowed me to keep my foot on the other chair. Food was great and staff was very courteous and helpful!Had a great time! Highly recommend it.

had 4pax family dinner at magarita‚Äôs @ dempsey on 14.4.2014. i was never quite into mexican food, but i guessed this was as good a time to start‚Ä¶haha. seemed it was quite difficult to get a booking. 3 of us went early at 630pm, among the first few tables. JH came later as he had to work late. the place was quite full actually, just couple tables unoccupied at 730pm.the reviews in hungrygowhere wasn‚Äôt too great, the few in 2014 commented it was expensive. tripadvisor had more good reviews.i still learning to tell burritos, fajitas (pronounced fa-hee-tas), enchiladas & what not.my initial impression hearing about the place was more drinking than food. but as it turned out, food was quite good really. we ordered a nachos, crab enchiladas (their specialty), a mixed chicken & prawns fajitas and a i think roast pork taco, and tres leches, a 3-milk cake. we also had 2 magaritas, 2 mocktails & a beer.need to try out other places though to compare. heard that cafe iguana is good.nachos picture was too dark. my wife & i both did not bring our hp. after JH arrived, he used his hp (torch app) to shine the light on the food for my daughter to take, so photos turned out better. all these phone apps are really useful.the nachos (a tortilla chip usually served as snack) with melted cheese, refried beans, jalapeno pepper etc was very good i thought. the word refried black beans intrigued me, so i googled. according to wikipedia, apparently the word is a mistranslation=in mexican spanish, re is an informal emphasis for very or well, so refried means very fried or well fried & refers to cooked and mashed beans. learn something everyday! the roast pork taco (top photo) was good too. the meat was more like braised than roast, and the texture was a pulled pork. braised & pulled textures not my favourite. the seasoning & taste was good. the corn tortillas were served separately (5 pieces) in a cloth warmer.& so was the prawns & chicken fajitas. the prawns were really nice & bouncy & the chicken was tasty & tender. the wheat tortillas were served separately (5 pieces) in a cloth warmer.all the food were really much above my expectations, though i did not actually expect much to start with‚Ä¶haha..but for me its fun to know new food.the crab enchiladas was the restaurant‚Äôs specialty & was very good. crab meat & sauce were tasty & overall a very good dish. we ordered the tres leches (3-milk) cake, with the exuberant encouragement/ suggestion by i think the proprietor. he said everyone thought it was good, especially that it was not too sweet.cake was ok, quite good. i learned afterwards that you could buy a carton of tres leches mix (say) from belmontemex, let it soaked through a cake for at least 24hrs to make a supposedly luscious 3-milk cake. cake was more dense than a normal cake as a result but still fluffy not dense like a cheesecake.i quite ok with it but not my favourite c/w (say) my own chocolate lava cake, cheese cake, some chocolate cakes & especially the passion fruit meringue from the patissier. service was good & friendly. bill was S$234nett, or about S$154nett less the drinks. we had an enjoyable evening & i got to quite like the food. :-)will be back. but maybe will try out cafe iguana or others first
5
A superb selection of mexican foods, nicely spiced but not overpoweringly. I recommend the soft tacos served with either beef, chicken or vegetables.Staff are very friendly and able to advise on non-menu specials and how spicy items are. Well worth a visit to Dempsey Hill
4
We have been frequenting this place for over 6 yrs now. Have never been dissappointed with the food or service. The nachos are amazing as are the enchiladas.
5
Keep on coming back to this place for the quality of the food, atmosphere, superb service . My daughters favorite restaurant..there is always room at the bar counter where you can enjoy the same menu without reservation.

Having spent a few weeks in Mexico enjoying true Mexican cuisine, Margarita's is somewhere to avoid. I've also been to and reviewed Cafe Iguana on Clarke Quay and would recommend that restaurant over this without hesitation.Margarita's offers what appears to be a varied, authentic menu, however unfortunately the execution is pre-fabricated, bland and unimaginative. Terrible (packet-tasting) guacamole, vegetarian burrito was more onions than anything else and barely any 'spice' to give it the kick it needs!We were a party of 2 couples, (one of which are from Nicaragua who know Central-South American cuisine) and a baby and although the service was great, the food was very disappointing and I wouldn't even give it a second chance. Please don't waste your time!
5
My whole family loves this place and has been going for almost 7 years!! I have never found a better tasting Margarita anywhere in Singapore. The food is fantastic! We have never had a bad dish. The prices are higher for sure but I have never felt its not worth it but that doesn't mean I wish they were not cheaper. Me and the kids love the chicken quesadillas even though they are just on the appetizer menu we like to have them as a meal. My husband loves the garbage can burrito(I think that's what its called) Just recently I tried the FIsh burrito and it was ok but not my favorite. Be sure to call for reservation if you don't like to wait. I have been able to just walk in and get a seat when I go early like 5 but by 7 this place is hopping which tells you how good it is. Yes service can be a bit slow at times but I love that cause it gives me time to savor and enjoy my tasty margarita before dinner arrives and with a basket of chips and salsa of course .Im not sure why so many bad reviews. Different strokes is all I can say cause if you like Mexican food I think you will love it here! Enjoy!

Today we have been at this restaurant with our 6 year old son. At Margarit`s they do not serve a kids menue. Just Margarita Pizza - and that for 20 Dollar.This pizza was so bad that my son did not eat it. The tomato sauce was sweet and the pizza was very soft. We told the waiter - but he did not do anything. My husband ordered a Beef Enchilada and I ordered a Pollo Enchilada I asked the waiter to put less meat inside and instead more salad or green stuff. The food was very soft and the taste was far away from real Mexican Food. Then we received the invoice. At the beginning the waiter told us that the Pizza will be 18 Dollars. Now he charged us 20 Dollars (more as for the adult enchiladas) And for my "less meat" enchilada they also charged me 20 instead of 19 Dollars. We asked the Supervisor. We told him that the Pizza Price for a child is rip off. He did not agree. He just said sorry that his waiter first told us that the pizza is 18 Dollars - the correct price is 20 Dollars. He told me that the higher Price for my Enchilada is due to the menue Change. You ask for less meat - and pay even more at the end. We felt being cheated.The supervisor was very arrogant and told us about the location, the price and the cost of the service people..... Come on - this is no argument for terrible food and high prices. We will definetly do not come back

Our first visit to Dempsey Hill during our visit to Singapore, and with so many choices for restaurants, it is unfortunate that we picked this one. Very disappointing service. Started out nic and friendly and helpful, but what disappointed us is that afer waiting longer than normal for the appetizer (but assuming this was because they needed time to make it properly), when we were about to slowly enjoy eating our appetizer, 30 seconds later the main dishes were served.What to do? Skip the appetizer to eat the main dishes hot? Or eat the appetizer and eat cooled down main dishes? Or rush through the appetizer and not enjoy it?Such a basic thing completely messed up. In fairness, I'll present their view: that my son said he was hungry when ordering and he asked them to bring the food quickly - but I also added at that time to bring the appetizer first before the main dishes (which is normally the case anyway, and not something I should need to state). Also, bringing the appetizer first would have met my son's request, and there can still be a gap for the main dishes.There were two other annoying aspects to the service which I won't get into here - but both related to unclear communication which led us to believe one thing, and then we were surprised when we saw the bill because this was different from our understanding.Finally - despite all of this - when I raised these concerns, there was not an iota of understanding/recognition that the customer might have a valid point of view, or at least some logic to his viewpoint (this applies both to the first issue highlighted above, and also to the two minor issues noted above). This in particular is what escalates this from just an annoying part of the evening (which I could have minimized in this review) to a very disappointing and frustrating experience. One of the most basic rules for cusotmer service is that it "takes two hands to clap", and even a simple recognition of our view would have been appreciated. Taking a self-righeous view is unprofessional and unappreciated when dealing with any customer. In my case, having eaten at top restaurants around the world for over 20 years, and having written around 60 TripAdvisor reviews with thousands of views, I was flabbergated by the attitude shown at this restaurant as compared wiht the attitude I've seen at other restaurants around the world.Now the rest - food was OK, Swiss cheese spinach enchilada was nice, and rest were OK/good. Ambience was nice. These points brought this from 'Terrible' to 'Poor'. But the poor service definitely left an indelible memory..
5
This place has everything you need a restaurant.- Ambience- Tasty food- Great serviceOur Aunt/ Uncle who live in Singapore took us to this place and said we couldn't leave without trying it, and I have to agree. The food was so good that I still miss the flavour of the potato skins that Andy (owner of Margarita's) had just introduced to the menu
5
I frequently visit this place and thought it deserves a review. The staff are very well trained and attentive, and the food is incredible. I would recommend the Fajita's or the Burrito, they never disappoint. And if you're having dessert - the Leche Frita is a MUST have, it is out of this world.I love the location of Dempsey Hill as well. I would definitely recommend this place for great Mexican food
5
Wow ! What a surprise! I came for dinner with my wife and we had a great time. The Mexican Food was delicious, and served hot. The service was very good and especially the young lady called Agnes (the manager) of the place, who took good care of us. Attentive to details and service oriented. I strongly recommend this restaurant and I will definitely return 
5
We were in a big group and had an excellent evening.The food was delicious and portions were big.The ambience was great.A prior reseveration is a must as they close at 11.The staff was very courteous and helpful specially Purshothaman and Sujit Deshmukh who really looked after us very well.After dinner when there were not enough taxis outside Sujit arranged taxis for all of us and waited outside till we left.It is great to have such dedicated staff
4
- Great food, nice service.
- Owner asks diners for feedback - on each of my past three visits
- Have become a regular

Two Texans came upon Margarita's while wandering around Dempsey Hill; what a pleasant surprise. Great Tex-Mex restaurant that could do well in Houston or Dallas, spectacular for Singapore. The carnita's were a taste of home. Service was excellent. Quite for a business conversation.
3
Great place, Food is AOK but costly.
CHA CHA CHA has really good Mexican food. Always consistent with reasonable prices.
5
We went with friends and had an excellent evening, having no experience of Mexican food we asked for advice from the owner , he suggested starters to share then we had main courses, if you are feeling hungry try the' kitchen sink' it was excellent and the Margaritas were good as well , the ambience was excellent a most enjoyable evening
5
I was in the mood for Margaritas and Mexican food‚Ä¶ found the right place at Dempsey Hill‚Ä¶ We had an outside table‚Ä¶ for starters we ordered nachos and jalapeno poppers; the portions were gigantic; but most importantly the starters tasted delicious. Then we had fajitas and chimichanga as main course. Both portions were gigantic and we could not finish them at all. The margaritas, we had frozen raspberry margaritas, were delicious. The service was nice and attentive. Certainly a place to going back again
2
We are used to the tex-mex food in North America. The food in this place was pathetic compared to that. The guacamole was without flavor - completely bland. The tacos were equally bland. The ambience was great though - with nice d√©cor and live music. If you are looking for good Mexican in Singapore, go to Lucha Loco
3
This place is renowned for serving heaps of food, some of it no so well presented. I would prefer less and more thoughtfully served. The food is ok as Mexican food goes. The ambiance is noisy hub bub so if that's your thing you will love it. The outside seating looks at a car park... This place is ok if you just need to eat and you are hungry, but not a dining experience
5
Dempsey Hills is a great place, although there are no hills but when you visit there it does not feel like that you are in the middle of city with so many variety of cuisines. Margaritas ambience was awesome. Everything from the tables to the bar and the seating arrangement really makes you feel that you are in Mexico. Food was awesome although a little expensive, but worth the money if you like mexican and have a taste for fancy restaurant.Must visit. You wont regret it
4
At first glance, the food is quite costly - $18 for a burrito. However, these are pretty big and are filled generously with meat not to mention delicious! Margarita's is a nice respite from cheaper Singaporean 'restaurants' that tend to be overcrowded. it's busy, not noisy, and the tables are nicely spaced apart so you can barely hear what's going on at the next table. It's dim and tastefully decorated with large paintings that draw the eye. Service was great that night - the server convinced us to share several dishes, so we could try more things. He explained each dish in detail and we ended up loving his recommendations! One of which is best described as a taco pizza topped with a salad ($20), which was delicious but could do with more meat as some slices only seemed to have black bean spread and lettuce on it. The chicken burrito was creamy and delicious. It was filling on its own, but it also came with a portion of rice, black beans and guacamole. The recommended beef fajita platter (40+) that could fill up 2-3 people (see pic). The beef was done medium rare and tasty, but also a little chewy. I much prefer the place in the late weekend afternoon, when the place is dark and it's really sunny outside. It's quite serene and relaxing that way
4
There is no dearth of Mexican restaurants in Singapore however Margarita definitely stands out for all the right reasons. Some of the dishes are unique to this place like the Tequilla Chicken. The flavoured margaritas is a must try (we tried the tamarind margarita which was very refreshing). The interiors and ambience is that of a fine dining. Food presentation is excellent. Some light music would add to the experience. Overall definitely must try for Mexican food lovers
4
The beef fajitas are memorable - Succulent slices of prime beef served on a hot plate. Make the fajitas with all the accompaniments for the perfect combination of flavors!
Tends to be crowded so reservations are recommended.
4
+ Fantastic service
+ Cosy beautiful interior
+ Lovely melted cheese
+ Good magaritas (duh!)
- Cant think of any actually!
Will definitely be back!
4
Great location, friendly staff and truly delicious Mexican food. Found it a bit strange that it emptied at around 1030 pm on a Saturday night but I guess people moved on to other places. Highly recommended.
4
A friend took us to Margarita's because the kids wanted something other than Asian food for a change. The frozen margaritas were delicious, as were the kids' mocktails. A couple of the dishes were pretty forgettable and although they sounded amazing on the menu, we would have preferred something else. They were both fishy ones but I can't remember what they were called!! What this place does amazingly well is Nachos. We loved them so much that we ordered another big plate. If nothing else, go for drinks and Nachos! Service gets a big thumbs-up from us. We had two lively boys with us and the staff were wonderful! Thank you :-
3
By Singapore standards, this is pretty good food. In reality - it is not actually Mexican or Tex Mex food but they try hard. The beers are cold, it is possible to get Jalapeno peppers with the food (because the food is not spicy in the least) and the environment is decent. Overall- if you have a desire for Mexican I am not sure you can do better in Singapore
3
we arrived there well after the lunch hour , around 330-4PM , the staff seemed to be having a briefing . the good thing is someone came over and offered us a table and advised us that the kitchen was open . later we were advised that there was were certain items not available due to the time. the food was very average, would not be rushing back in there soon considering the variety of places in the Dempsey area
4
Been to a number of Mexican restaurants around the world and this certainly is in my top 5 for a number of reasons. The food portions are huge, so watch out! The menu is what you would expect in a classic Mexican restaurant. The service is good and friendly. This place is kid friendly so gets an additional point from me...You have seating outside if you want to experience the humidity of Singapore with some spicy food. The area is buzzing and overall a good experience and worth visiting
2
We love Mexican food, and have for long been returning customers at Margarita's. The food is good and the service friendly. The ambience is nice and it is always packed on weekends. We love the nachos, quesadillas, burritos, fajitas and the frozen margaritas. However the last two visits have been a letdown. On one visit our party of 5 was shown to a small table with four chairs despite holding an advance reservation. We were then made to wait for half an hour for a table for five. We werent offered even a bowl of chips during our wait.On our last visit we ordered our favourite chicken burrito. After placing the order the person serving us told us that they wouldn't be serving the salad which normally accompanies it as they had run out of salad. She went on to explain that the restaurant was closing the next day for a week of renovation and had therefore not ordered supplies and had run out!! They replaced the fresh salad with potato wedges... from a packet. When the burritos came, we realised that even the chicken filling wasn't the normal one. They had filled the burritos with the chicken from their fajita dish. It didn't taste good, and we all struggled to finish what was on our plate. Not Cool at all Margarita's !
5
Delicious cuisines, romantic ambiance and superb service is what make this restaurant one of my top choice in Singapore. Sitting in pristine surroundings of Dempsey Hills, Margaritas's offers to wide selection of margaritas with expanded food menu (even for a vegetarian like me). Do try house-special margaritas and Nachos to begin with. Reserve a table in advance to avoid disappointment if you happen to visit on weekend
4
I have been to three Margarita's locations in Singapore and this one is my favorite. The interior of the restaurant was redone a few years ago and it's really a lovely restaurant to eat in. High ceilings....fantastic paintings on the wall....great colors....very nice atmosphere. Service is always good and the food is great. I would recommend both the fajitas and the 'kitchen sink'. Overall, this is one of the nicest casual dining restaurants in Singapore. Dempsey is a little enclave full of restaurants and bars so you can spend a night there. Would highly recommend this restaurant
5
Great Mexican- American food served in a lively atmosphere with all the bells & whistles! Children friendly, so you could visit with family!
3
We dropped in here for a drink while wailing for our table at the Jumbo in Dempsy. Was fine with good cocktails. We didnt eat here though.
5
this restaurent is serving mexican food. the ambience, service and food are exceedingly good.they also make excellant cocktails. the CHILE BEER and FROZEN MARGERITA are out of the world. if you are a foodie and in singapore then this is a must visit place
3
We came here with a few friends for some after dinner drinks. Cocktails were good and they even had a small band playing some dance tunes which was good fun.
3
We had diner at several occasions, Service is sometimes not top notch but food is good as well as frozen margaritas. We willkeep on coming as the ambiance is nice and food constantly great !
4
I've only been to one other Mexican Restaurant in Dempsy hill and this one is the best (so far) that I can say is Tex-Mex taste. I find that good margaritas, strong, without the tequila aftertaste and not too sweet is my favorite way to consume a margarita. Here that is how they make it. Defiantly more expensive than other places but all I need is one . Second Tex-mex rating is on the salsa. I'm not a chipotle fan, so using it in salsa is not my choice. Here it is used, but at least it's not as pungent as it is at other restaurants in town. Because of this, I give it a thubs up for Salsa in Singapore.Restaurant is large and well maintained, large bar area to sit and eat a meal by yourself or with others. Menu is extensive and has all of the usual suspects. I had the chile relleno. They even made it with shrimp instead of meat (which is hard to get any restaurant on this side of the world to make food outside of what's in the menu) it was very good. Husband had the burrito and his complaint was there was the meat was not as flavorful as what we get back home. But cover it in some queso, and well, cheese always makes it taste better
4
Went to Margaritas in a small group. We had to book as it is a very popular restaurant. Got seated promptly and had attentive service throughout. Good margaritas by the pitcher.Good food but lacking the last bit of oomph to give it the 5th star. Highly recommended
5
Make a reservation if its anywhere near the weekend else make your peace with a waiting list. But there's plenty to do while you're waiting. The bubbly barman is sure to visit you as a tactic to have u hooked on the drinks before you get to the menu. As the name suggests, don't miss the margaritas. The classic or the fruity, the traditional or the ones with a modern twist. Try me all! I had a mango margarita for the first time in my life and am hooked! Depends on your company, try a seat by the bar, that's where all the action is. The food is average- our burrito was sloppy and gooey. The fajitas were fine though cumbersome to make after pitchers of margaritas down. Also they charge for jalape√É¬±os?! Which true blue Mexican restaurant does that?! It's meant to be a natural condiment to the meal! The nachos were fine, a bit less salty maybe to cater to the heavy inflow of expat palettes. Overall will go back for the ambience and the fab fab drinks
2
My husband and I tried this restaurant on a Saturday night for a good meal and margaritas afterwards. I asked for chicken fajitas. The chicken was so chewy it was impossible to eat it! It also had no taste, no seasonings. The funny part is that the restaurant manager passed by us and noticed I was not eating, so he asked me why. I told him that the meat was extremely hard to chew on and that it also was not seasoned as it should be with Mexican food, but he kept trying to convince me that that was just my impression and that the meat was perfect! The situation was so surreal that I was in complete disbelief. Try La Salsa. The food there is much better, though not yet to Mexican or Texan standards
4
This restaurant on emerald hill is accessible only via car/taxi but has great mexican food ! Its definitely on the expensive side and not for the budget traveler. The tables are not easily available so its best to book in advance ( if you have a local sim you can also dial 100 and get the number! )Chicken fahitas and blue margaritas were a hit with me! Service is good but on the slower side as it seems to be a place people come to spend a couple of hours in (I went on a saturday afternoon !). The portion sizes are good so I didn't have the dessert after starters and mains !
4
Nice strong margaritas, yummy crab enchiladas. The bill was about twice what I was expecting, but that's Singapore for you...
4
If it is Mexican food you crave for in Singapore, look no further. They have the entire range, from fajitas to burritos to quesadillas etc. Not too pricey, a great atmosphere, ( we sat outdoors) and great Margaritas! The food and desserts were superb! Highly recommend this restaurant
4
After staying in Singapore for a few weeks we decided to have a break from oriental food. Margarita's is certainly the place to go to and we even returned the next week. The lime margarita's were very good, go for the pitcher if you are with a bigger group. Food was also very nice and almost made you believe you were in Mexico. As mentioned by other travelers it is pricy but not out of line with other restaurants in Singapor
5
margaritas is just plain delicious and not plain at all. The burritos were so tasty, and not too cheesy or smoothered in sour cream and guacamole. Just the right amounts of taste and spices to make you sad when a dish is over. nachos was great, and the drinks were generous, Staff were fun and helpful. cant wait for the next visit

If I were judging this restaurant on curve and gave it bonus points for being halfway around the world from Mexico, it would probably get 4 stars. Pros:-The menu is small, but a pretty good approximation of Mexican restaurants in North America-The chips were good; the salsa was excellent-The margaritas were excellent as wellCons:-The carnitas tasted pretty bland-The restaurant is expensive, even by Singaporean standardsI would probably go back, but I certainly will wait until I have a strong hankering for Mexican food before I do so

...the only reason is because we've had better, for much less. Better: We were really in the mood for Mexican food on this particular night. And having lived in the U.S. for many years, this was the closest and most authentic tasting food we've had in our 4 years living in Asia. LESS: Our ticket for chips and salsa (which were charged as an appetizer) two entrees (my wife had an enchilada plate with rice and beans, and I had the steak/chicken fajitas which came with 5 tortillas) and drinks (one virgin margarita and mojito) amounted S$90+, or to put things into perspective, about 80 USD. Maybe I'm out of touch, but that just seems a bit steep for a less than perfect Mexican meal back in the U.S. Nevertheless, I would still highly recommend it to anyone wanting to get their Mexican on. It isn't the easiest cuisine to locate over here

I took a friend to Margharitas this week. It was quietish (school night so to be expected). We orderded a jug of maragharitas and some checken and bean fajitas. The portions were huge, the food was tasty and the maragharitas flowed nicely. After dinner wandered off to Harry's and finished off the night nicely. Excellent midweek reprieve

My wife and I went to Margarita's on Saturday night. My wife is from Houston and is missing TexMex food since we transferred to Singapore just over one year ago. After she made a reservation at Margarita's in Dempsey Hill I was a little skeptical before visiting this restaurant based on the mixed reviews from other people, especially in relation to the service level.I have to say that the service levels in the restaurant were excellent during our dinner. We had made reservations for 8.30pm but arrived at 8.10pm. Our table was available straight away. The service during the dinner was very good.The food itself was good (not great by Houston standards) but taking into account that we are in South East Asia I think the food was better than we expected. I would suggest that they serve more tortilla chips with their starters as it is not enough especially for customers who are used to free tortilla chips. The quality and quantity of the main entrees was more than adequate, even for people with large appetites.Overall my wife and I were quite satisfied with our visit to Margarita's and we will go back for our TexMex fix

I've been here before a few times. The mood lighting and relaxed atmosphere is always welcome after a long week at work. I like the margaritas in general; enjoyed both the frozen and the "on the rocks" versions. While the Fajitas as predictably well done, the chilli peppers are real treat. But yesterday I was delighted after trying the chilli chocolate for the first time. The brownie just melts in your mouth and the chilli hits the back of your throat after. The balance is just right, neither overpowering the other. Try it!

I always make it a point to visit Margarita's whenever I am in Singapore. It has some of the best Mexican food that I have ever had. The atmosphere is brilliant and the staff are polite. It is a pain however to try and find a space to sit on a weekend day. If dont have reservations I recommend going on your own risk. We were almost turned away this time around but managed to get a seat at the last minute. The place was a little pricey but I highly recommend it!!

The Margarita's restaurant is one the finest fine dining restaurants in Singapore. Located at Dempsey's an exclusive area of Singapore . Margarita's offers one of the finest range of excellent Mexican cuisine.Great place for small group parties.Service is world class and the food divine.
4
Good quesadillas, good chips and dip. Service not bad, though the place does get busy and it can be hard to get a table, so make reservations as soon as possible.
4
we were a large host of people, so sat at a long table and had pitchers of cold Margaritas- what else can you possibly want? food was nice too...
4
Consistently good, delicious food and nice ambience. Service was attentive. Prices are not cheap but you get quality Mexican food.
4
If you ever get tired of all the wonderful and varied Asian cuisine in Singapore (as if), head to Margarita's on Demspey road for Mexican food. My husband and I visited on a Saturday night and were pleased with our meal--nachos, chicken enchiladas, and a pitcher of margaritas to wash it all down. Even though it was busy, our meal came out fairly quickly and the waitress never left us unattended for long. Margaritas is not the quiet, romantic sort of place, in fact it's quite loud and boisterous. I felt the food was quite expensive--especially the alcohol, but I suppose that's par for the course in Singapore
4
Went there first time with my wife, had only a drink - Margarita and Tequila Sunrise. But we really enjoyed the place so we decided to come back for food. My wife had the lamb shank and I had the steak with all sorts of mexican sides. We had a great dinner, overall a great night, if I forget the bill went to 200SGD for food (main courses) and drinks (2 cocktails each). To me, a place where I would go back
4
I am a bit spoiled on Mexican food coming from Houston. The food here is probably the second best mexican I have had in Singapore. The carne asada is the best thing on the menu. The other dishes I have tried, are just ok. The nachos are pretty good too. If you have a Mexican craving, this will hit the spot. I did try the wet burrito too. It wasn't bad but nothing to fall over for. Pretty expensive for Mexican food
3
I think the restaurant is becoming a victim of it's own success.....went over the weekend with the family and it was a very average experience...i think the food was atrocious.....too many people...the chef is obviously tired and kitchen has nothing exciting to offer. Even though menu has been changed recently the food quality has decilined ovre years....maybe just a one off experience but good restaurants perform consistent
4
What I like about Margarita's Dempsey Road is its ambience, decor and location. Second the food is adequately good- although not as good as in Houston. We found the service was efficient and the food came really fast - in fact we had not finished our appetiser, our main course had arrived ! I wonder if it was due to our table had been previously booked for an hour and a half later. Trying to book table by phone can be tricky as you may expect a 'fully booked' response. I would suggest just get there and hope you get a table ( most likely you will - several tables had reservation signs all the time we were there ). If you don't, two restaurants down, there is Salsa, Mexican restaurant with Live band
3
at all of their outlets, their one consistent standard is the Slowness of their service. Food takes a long time to arrive after placing orders, and often get missed. There aren't too many places in Singapore offering mexican menu and Magarita's is one of them, the food is really quite nice but unfortunatley it would be better if service can be improved.
5
this was one of the best places we ate in singapore,
the food was fabulous
the staff was extremely nice and very very attentive
the attention to a clients satisfaction was the priority.
a well spent evening with tasty food.
4
Nice and welcoming ambience for gathering or family dinner.
The food is tasty and quite authentic. The portion is big which is beyond our expectation, thus, it's valued for money.
Last but not least, the service is good!
4
Prices are reasonable. Food is authentic. Margarita drink is one of the best. But, environment can be noisy when the restaurant is crowded.
3
Standard fare, but comfortable atmosphere and decent service and a lack of alternatives bring us back...but not often. Kids really like it
4
One of the good resturants on Demsy hill, we went to margarita for lunch. Great food in an easy going atmosphere. Must order the pitcher of lemon Margarita. They know there tequila's.
5
We are regulars here and dine at Margarita's at least one a month. All the dishes that we've tried are really good and the food and service is consistent during all our visits. The decor is nice too. For us, this is one of the best Mexican restaurants in Singapore
4
this is one of those places where we keep coming back to again and again... simply because there aren't enough good mexican food places in Singapore to go to... if anyone knows any, please do let me know! (i've noticed many Spanish places opening up however... hmmmm....
4
Good chimichanga is not easy to find in Singapore and Margarita's make a mean one! =) I've been a fan for more than 20 years now and continue to visit Margarita for the crunchy Mexican "popiah" served with loads of sour cream. The salt-rimmed mango margarita is a good accompaniment
3
Went for a mooch in Dempsey the other Saturday at 2.30 ish, strangely it doesn't serve food from 3pm till dinner servings on a Saturday or any day from memory. Mexican food is really cheap to make so I think it was expensive for what it was, and the quality was ok, also normally with Mexican there is big portions, this unfortunately wasn't
4
We had food at this restaurant last week, the third time in as many years. The quality hasn't changed one bit and the food tasted nice every time we went. Note one more thing that the portions here are rather huge, so unless you are very careful you are going to end up over-ordering. Note that. We learnt that from `experience'' of over ordering. Nachos are great, the sauces are amazing and the Tacos are quite tasty. My wife and I are vegetarians, so can't' talk about meat they serve. Vegetarians - you aren't going to go hungry out of here. The decor is quite cosy, although I'd have thought they could have done it up a bit better
4
Great beef steak. I love the spicy Gravy. The cocktails are quite strong.
5
I love the food, the ambience and the service. These factors make a wonderful dining experience.
3
Very mediocre renditions of a standard Mexican menu. I'm not sure the Margarita's actually had tequila. There aren't very many Mexican spots in Singapore, so if you need a fix, I guess this will do, but wouldn't go out of my way to go back.
3
The food is ok. It might be unfair that I am still looking for authentic Tex-Mex food in Singapore. Margarita's does not meet those expectations, but is on par with other Mexican restaurants in town.
4
great maragritas, pleasant cantina feel (at least some of the nights we have been), always busy but a bit pricey for what is essentially peasant food!
5
If you're looking for a night out to contain your appetite and sip some margarita's this restaurant surely is the best choice.Their fajitas was very delicious accompanied by their Mango frozen margarita was simply the best choice made.Located at Dempsey- it is quite hard for those of you who are relying on cab's pass by. pre odering a cab would be the best choic
4
After being away from home for several weeks, and having several margritas around SE Asia, this was the best margrita I have haved in SE Asia!!The atmosphere was great. The food was good also. The wait staff was very helpful and very friendly.The bartender is teh one who made the evening. He said that if the margrita was not as good as I had from home, he would not charge me. Of course he was kidding, but it was fun to play along for a laugh.I will definitly go back there next time I am in Singapor
2
I ordered the chicken soft tacos (S$20), and while I love flavorful hot Mexican food, this fell WAY short. The seasoning was more like a Louisiana black pepper, rather than anything related to the jalapeno or serrano pepper. There were black pepper specks all thru the food...leading to a painfully burning mouth, without any of the front-end flavor. These were easily the worst tacos I have had in a long time.My colleagues tried the "kitchen sink" burrito...and they liked it. Everything is expensive, and the margaritas/sangria are prohibitively so.Service was ok...which is great for Singapore
1
Awful staff and service. The staff look like the would rather be somewhere else. The place is closed half the time. Margaritas are totally overpriced at $65++ for a pitcher. There are much better places in Dempsey such as the very good Huber Butcher / Restaurant and Jones the Groce
4
This restaurant is in a really nice spread out dining / retail area in converted army barracks - parking can be a challenge if you go at peak meal hours.Helpings are large - after the margaritas and starters we had, we should have shared the main course between two people. A very satisfactory experience 
5
Love the food, love the margarita's always a fun night
1
Could be frozen mexican food, it would taste the same.
Avoid, unless you're happy to pay dempsey prices for a readymade meal!
1
Miserable manage made us delete photos of the food ! Normally we would post pictures on Facebook this the horrible female manager would not allow us to leave until she had checked our camera for pictures. Would not recommend this place to anyone !!!!

Always packed as very popular and great value! Food is tasty, good quality and very reasonably priced.

I used to be a regular, till yestreday. A few weeks back, I got some fish that smelt "fishy" and was clearly not fresh. They accepted to change it for something else. Last night, not having learned my lesson, I ordered Alaskan crab encheladas, charged S$42!!! Again the smell was not enticing, but I persisted and had a few bites. Not being able to take more, I called the maitre d'hotel, who explained that this was perfectly good crab, but frozen. Not wanting to argue, I asked him to take away the crab and bring me a non-seafood dish. Both the crab and the replacement dish were dutyfully charged, bring the total price to a handsome S$167 for a simple weekday dinner for two... And this morning, I paid a further price for the few bites of crab: I still have diarrhoea as I type..

Ok, my preference of mexican is usually more tex mex leaning, so i have an odd taste for mexi to start with. however my chimmichanga was outstanding!! the rice had an odd fish flavor i couldn't identify... the decore was a bit off, not really mexican, not really spaninish, the painting had be quite confused. the grand Rita was fabulous, i disagree with someone elses' assessment that they were too sweet, but again, mexican taste will always vary based on who is in the kitche
1
Ok, so we don't live in San Diego anymore but this restaurant is a train wreck... Servers are clueless, margaritas are too sweet, burritos are not worthy of feeding to the family dog. If you are craving Mexican DON'T even go to this place... We even met the owners and they don't seem to care that their place is crap. Worst, overpriced ($80 a head) Mexican ever!!
4
I visited this place 3 years ago and it's taken this long to give it another shot (after friends had told me how much they liked it) . I judge a Mexican restaurant by the basics. And I was pretty well pleased. The rice is great (has spinach and cheese), beans OK, nachos pretty good. But the margaritas were excellent (classic, on the rocks) and we loved our entrees. I had the beef soft tacos and wife tequila lime chicken. Both were cooked well and savory. The guacamole could use work and they should use better cheese
5
Who doesn't like Mexican food?First time here was a walk-in for my partner and myself. Fortunately they had a table and we are fast eaters; the 2 hours they gave us was ample time to enjoy the food we had ordered.starters was (and now will always be) the quesadillas with mushrooms and cheese. oh it is divine! one is just enough to share for 2 because the main course will be a real contender i assure you.main course were the fajitas with mixed beef and chicken for him and vegetables for me. we like to have a mix of all. if you are not a big eater, it would be good to share the fajitas and order another side. it really is filling.we are never disappointed with the food here; the service is not perfect but if you expect any service to be, you would best stay at home
4
My son (who lives in Singapore), his girlfriend and I had dinner at Margarita's on the last night of my stay in Singapore and it was fantastic, if somewhat pricey.We shared a plate of nachos and I then had the chicken fajitas which was absolutely delicious. Portions are generous. My son and his girlfriend had the chocolate chicken which they said was OK.The service could not be faulted.I would definitely recommend this restaurant especially to people seeking a change from the usual cuisine of Singapore
1
It is over priced for the quality of food, not authentic Mexican. Service is the worst I've experienced in Singapore.
2
food so-so and poor service.
3
Average...
5
Awesome Latin Food, portions are pretty generous and authentic flavors. check out the crab enchiladas, seafood ceviche and the Chilean wines called PengWine :)
4
great burritos!
4
Nice place for a dinner. But hate it when it gets really crowded. Their chimichangas are really nice. Nice ambience, staff really look like mexicans but they are not if I'm not wrong. It would be better with mexican musicians around!!!
5
MY wife and I must have eaten at this Dempsey Hill restaurant at least 20 times over the past 18 months. The food is amazing on a consistent basis and we always leave extremely happy. We always make sure to eat here when we have friends and family visiting from abroad as its always a hit.Its best to make reservations as they often times are booked solid. Sometimes they have a few extra stools at the bar you can sit at.Be sure to ask if the owner has any specials to offer. Quite often he makes specials but these are not made aware to the average patron. I personally like the pork tamales
4
Decent food - had the enchiladas and nachos and the corn soup. All reasonably good and tasty - in the pop culture mexican style, not authentic style.. Dishes were a bit overpriced, but that Singapore western restaurants in general, not this place specifically. The atmosphere is ok, the main sitting area is nothing special - big, airy but devoid of character. Sitting near the bar and eating there adds a bit more energy to the experience if you are in a small group
4
We went for lunch at the weekend, it was full of families and had a really good vibe to it. Service was excellent despite being obviously rushed off their feet. Food was as good as any other Mexican I'd been to with generous sized portions - we all had fahitas

I had the misfortune of visiting Margarita's at Dempsey road this July 09.While the entire Dempsey Road collection of restaurants are in a very charming area, the food at this restaurant went in exactly the opposite direction.There is no doubt that this is a popular restaurant however, I could not fathom why.The restaurant was packed and the tables are very close to one another. Therefore, you are always part of your neighbors conversation.The service is absolutely atrocious. Don't get me wrong. It isn't rude or arrogant. The staff is just very very amateurish and will forget your requests without fail.I had to ask for my beer 4 times before it finally graced my table. I asked for some sour cream but till the end of my meal, it never made an appearance.The food was extremely mediocre and devoid of the flavors one would associate with good Mex food. Right from the tacos to the fajitas, everything tasted bland and put together without any passion or enthusiasm.The Kahlua Tiramisu was the only thing on the menu that had any personality.And then the long walk to a taxi.Just not worth the effort. A definate skip
3
ok, prices high, dont like being charged forextra tortilla with the fajitas!!!
3
Love the mango margaritas!!
5
the crab enchilada is to die for
3
Good ambience/venue but food is only so-so plus the service is sub-par. Worth a try though
4
Excellent food but a bit pricey...
3
Ordinary taste and not value for money
3
Pricey, but the food is closest to the real thing we've found so far!
3
ok...good drinks, food alright, satisfies the mexican craving but not super good...just ok
4
One of the most go at Dempsey!
5
Absolutely. Go there tonight. Classic.
4
yummm! this place brings me back to Mexicali. love the Burritos. the best mexican restaurant by far in SG.
3

If you like Tarco Bell, this is many times better :)

Go for the special dishes that are not on the menu. Ask Andy to recommend

Very nice frozen margarita's. Chicken fajita is very good too.
