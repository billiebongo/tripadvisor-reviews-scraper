This is a typical corner place food is ordered through an iPad which is weird for a traditional place, served quickly and was tasty,

This us definitely not the best Bah Kut Teh in town. But it is good enough if one suddenly have a craving as this is located in Kallang Wave which is reachable by circle line.

Had this at their Westgate Mall branch. They serve generous portions, and you will surely leave very full and satisfied. The service was excellent as well; they refilled the soup even without having to be asked.

Cost for 2: About $30 including drinksHad the mushroom soup (free flow) with rice, which was delicious. I saw others enjoying the loin ribs too. I am definitely going to try that next on my visit.I highly recommend this place for lunch. Itâ€™s light on the pocket and light on the stomach.I took away 1 star as my soup did not stay warm, or maybe no one told me how to operate the stove

having tried many bakuteh places, this ranks one of the best. the portion for its ribs is always big (great for a big eater like myself). the taukee and beancurd were very smooth and absolute delight to devour. youtiao is always served crispy as well. whenever i have a bakuteh craving, i always think of this place

Pricey but good. 2 person <30 dollars. love the endless topup of soup. Best buy would be the promotion sets, however i wish one day there will be a option to change the main soup. instead of bah kut teh we can choose like pig's stomach soup or others

I'm sure there will always be a better place in Singapore for Bak Kut Teh. Just like all the other favorite foods in Singapore, it all boils down to personal taste and preference. For me, this particular branch is first and foremost centrally located at Kallang Wave, which has more than ample car park and even at peak hours, the wait for a table is not that bad. I like the clear and peppery soup and the set menus are very nicely priced. Best of all free helpings of chili, sauces and other condiments. Maybe one of the best you tiao services in a BKT restaurant too.

Was there last sat for dinner. As this is our first time patronising this outlet, we are not aware of their electronic menu system.We seated ourself at the table and waited for the server to take our order.No one attended to us.So we waved for attention and finally someone came over to tell us we shoulld order through the Ipad. We felt that they should orientate us instead of assuming that we are aware of it.Also where to obtain the cutlery which is hidden at the side of the table.When we request for sauces,, we were told to help ourself at the sauce counter.So, we assume that there should not be a 10% service charge as everything we did ourself (like at macdonalds).So when the bill came, we were surprised that there is a 10% service charge when no service is rendered

Extremely accessible- This is my go to place for BKT. I normally order the normal ribs- They are always tender with full flavor. The broth is amazing. This is in my opinion a place to go! I also frequent the store at Funan Center. Just as good. I have brought overseas visitors there and they love this place as well
