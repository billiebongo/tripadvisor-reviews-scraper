For full review, visit: http://epicuriouscan.wordpress.com/2014/07/29/have-a-break-go-vegan/FYI, they've relocated to:229 Joo Chiat Road #01-01 Singapore 427489http://www.lovinghut.com.sgLoving Hut is a franchise from the global group, and is actively promoting foodies to try going vegan for a change. Not particularly for any religious reasons, but more for health as well as being part of a global initiative, to improve our environment.To be honest, it started out quite a big challenge for me, since I’m a bona fide meatarian. However, this was an eye opener; owing to the creativity & impression set upon my 1st encounter at this cozy little hidden find.Loving Hut has conjured a localized menu that adheres strictly to their vegan principles without compromise for taste & texture. Not to mention, the calorie count is endorsed by Health Promotion Board (HPB) too. So, the weight watchers, health conscious and those with stricter dietary regimes need not fret.Some highlights:The Miracle Juice is a concoction of apples, beetroot, carrots & pineapple. This combination is probably one of the most vitamin packed beverage I’ve had in a while. The fragrant & sweet pineapple give it a tropical breezeThe Avocado Smoothie is a blend of avocado, coconut juice & flesh. The texture is buttery, and thirst quenching.Bali Bliss Soba Salad (I like much!)– this is a buckwheat soba noodle inspired dish that boasts a long list of nutritional benefits. Thinly julienned carrots, radish, beetroot, avocado, topped with alfalfa sprouts & baked tempeh, blanketing the chilled soba. Drizzle the sesame & balsamic vinegar dressing, give it a toss, and it’s ready for consumption. In my opinion is an ideal meal for any given day, all the more appropriate if it’s been a hot day.Nyonya Laksa Lemak (I like much!)– this is somewhat a lighter version of the infamous Laksa, and because it is lighter, it is also less spicy than the usual. Flavor is familiar as to the Kelantan Laksa. I enjoyed it very much; had 2nd & 3rd helpings, and eventually I did everyone the honor of finishing it. This dish features imported mock prawns from Taiwan, and they’ve subsidized coconut milk with a good portion of soya milk.Miss Saigon Pho Noodle Soup (I like much!) – This is probably another game changer that impressed me much. I survived pretty much on Pho while I read my degree abroad. This vegan soup base is something out of this world. Little did I know, that much can be achieved from vegetables & sweetcorn that actually taste better than those from meat/ bones stock. The choice of thinner rice noodles is intentional, so that you can enjoy more of the soup as you go along.Mudvelicious – chocolate soy ice-cream mud pie, layered with chilled walnut paste & crumbsThe Daily Scoop – soy based low fat brown rice ice-cream available in several flavors; chocolate, vanilla, strawberry and hazelnut, topped with almond flakes & drizzles of chocolate sauce.Vegan Beers – Beer you’ll never get drunk on, true to the taste with malt fragrance but with literally no alcohol content. Personally, the white is good, but I have preference for the darker version.Happy Hour on Saturday, Sunday & Public Holidays (1600-1800hrs), 20% discount for all desserts.This one time experience has changed my perspective & stereotype towards vegan/ vegetarian food for good. In fact, I’ve been trying different things in the kitchen in recent days, in the hope that I can conjure some healthy meat-free dishes myself

I'll go back there are there were kits of yummy looking choices and I'll need to try them. Good value for mone

I'm trying to work my way through all the Loving Huts in the world. Singapore has been the fourth one I've been to and was just as impressed as the first time I went to the one in the UK. The staff at Suntec are helpful and polite. They have plenty of seating and the menu has great choice.I tried the Lemongrass Curry with rice, spaghetti arriabiata, Sweet sour nuggets, Lemon Chicken and spring rolls. All were great portion sizes and tasted great.Definitely worth a visit for vegetarians and vegans and omnivores too! (my boyfriend eats meat but loved his meals here

The food here are all vegan. A lot of food choices and the price range is around $5-$11 for main course. There are a lot of snacks as well as drinks. Overall, I'm really satisfied with the food and will be coming back in the futurw

I would not have thought of going to a vegan restaurant if not for the fact that the friends we were eating with are vegan. It was a very pleasant surprise - every dish was good (and we ordered quite a number) and the absence of meat was not felt at all. I would go back anytime

If you're looking for a vegan restaurant in Singapore, you're in for a tough search. We found many restauranteurs gave us a strange look when we asked about vegan options. However, we found The Loving Hut at Suntec to be a great place to pick up some well-prepared vegan food. It's not a restaurant, more foodcourt-style dining, but it is a great place for plenty of vegan options

We have frequented Loving huts in 3 separate continents now. They were all superb. They are also quite different to one another. They offer tasty Vegan cuisine at competitive prices. We particularly recommend the vegan cheesecake on offer here. Not necessarily easy to find, although you'll get there if you manage to find Suntec City. It is on the top floor of this extensive mall

Located on the top level in Tower 3 of Suntec City Mall, this place is great. Polite staff, quick service. Mock meat, cooked with lots of flavors make it really tasty - specially the Redang, which is served with soup and rice. The nonya laksa and crispy oyster mushrooms which we tried were excellent too. This is the link to their menu - http://www.lovinghut.com.sg/sin-suntec-en/menu Easy on the pocket too. Decent sized portions. Went back a the next day. Bliss for vegetarians looking for a good meal without burning their pockets.Would definitely go back to try all the other dishes and recommend it for all vegetarians

Set in a huge mall few people visit, this is a great place to eat a quick meal. Laksa, Ramen, Fried mushrooms and spring rolls, delicately flavoured, easy on the pocket and quickly served with a smile. Seal your meal off with a cappucino decorated with the Restaurant logo
