Excellent food with good service to match.
Good effort put in to create some special version of CNY dishes.

The five stars given are based mainly on really good food in this place. The place is in an oriental setting, comfortable and clean. Location is at peck seah st, about 3mins walk from tanjong pagar mrt.Try the dungeness crab in golden sauce, steamed grouper, prawn mayo with smoked duck, boston lobster in superior broth. You will not be disappointed. Lastly to top it off, try the chilled hashima for dessert. Bill is slightly high at about $50 per pax but fresh ingredients are used, so it's worth it

Shared a meal with old schoolmates. Delicious food, especially the Crabs, Beef and Mee Hoon dish. One of the best fried Mantou (not greasy) I have ever tasted for sopping up the Crab gravy followed by delicious cooling desserts. All in all, great friends, food and dinner

Cove99 serves good seafood. The menu is reasonably priced. They offer a set lunch for $22.90++ for a 5-course meal. This is good value for a business lunch. It is not a big restaurant, so if you intend to bring a big party, please reserve. Service is prompt and friendly.

I lived around the corner from this restaurant when I stayed in Singapore for a month and my wife and I loved this restaurant. All the dishes are authentically cooked (canto style) and prepared with care - and you can taste it! The service is great, the environment is clean, and the seafood is fresh. Recommend

I've been here for lunch (set menus and ala carte), dinner (ala carte) and birthday celebrations. The dining experience has always been positive with well-prepared food (=fresh ingredients, cooked properly), polite and efficient service. In terms of food, it is my go-to-place whenever I have seafood cravings and what makes it even better is that you can choose your style of preparation to suit your cravings for the day. Recommendations on some of the dishes that I love:1) Boston Lobster with Superior Broth - Thick and creamy broth with huge chunks of lobster meat. Gets me salivating whenever I think about it. 2) Snow Crab Steamed with Egg white - Unlike the common chili crab or black pepper crab, the flesh of the snow crab is very sweet and together with the smooth texture of the egg white, it definitely brings out the taste of the original ingredients unlike in chili crab and black pepper crab where the condiments cover the freshness of the crab.3) Braised sea cucumber with wild mushrooms - This is my mum's favourite dish of the restaurant. The sea cucumber is very soft and fully absorbed the flavourful seasonings makes it to one of my recommended dishes. This of course depends on whether you like the soft and gelatinous texture of sea cucumber in the first place. 4) Chilled hashima with rock sugar - soothing and refreshing dessert, especially suitable after a savoury and delectable seafood feast. Service here is good though not perfect. Ambience is comfortable and clean. Would recommend their set menus for people looking to have business meetings over lunch/dinner

Have been to this restaurant for 2 times in a row in a couple of months late last year. My boss had invited us for a team gathering dinner and another on a festive occasion. Despite the location, it can be very crowded during the afternoon lunch hour and night time was the best time to visit this restaurant as it is conveniently located within close proximity to the Tanjong Pagar MRT Station and the customers was not that much since it is close to all the pubs nearby. The food is nicely done up and the ambient is really nice and feels at ease. Do drop by for dinner if you are there.....they serve very nice and authentic chilli/black pepper crabs with hot deep fried buns....to dip into and eat with the gravy of the crabs till you suck our very own thumbs,really nice....not that spicy after all...

My family has dined 3 times at Cove 99. The food quality has always been very praiseworthy. The chilli crabs, the cod fish & the fish paste noodles are our favourites. The attention & kind service that they give to my elderly mum is something that I'm especially appreciative of: offering to cut broccoli into smaller pieces, opening both glass door panels in readiness for the wheelchair, etc

We were very kindly taken out for dinner here by Singaporean friends. They had followed the chef here from another restaurant, which seems a good affirmation of the quality of the cooking.We left our hosts to choose the dishes, which were brought out, beautifully presented, and decanted onto smaller plates as we ate our way into each plate.The restaurant is described as a 'live seafood' restaurant, and there were tanks at the back with fish etc in. Decor was open, photos of all the chefs on the walls, simple tables and chairs with marble floors.Not many westerners there, in fact I think we were the only ones that night, clearly the restaurant is a secret that, for the time being, the Singaporeans wish to keep to themselves
