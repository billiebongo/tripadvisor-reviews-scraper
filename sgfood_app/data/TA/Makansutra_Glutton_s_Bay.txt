This seems to be a tourist site but still worth to visit. There are various small popup stores including seafood. From the outdoor table you can enjoy the bay view. Maybe overpriced, but not too much for tourists.
5
Your choice of a range of stalls with a range of (mostly) Singaporean seafood classics. My Hokkien mee prawn noodles were mighty fine, and this market of food stalls combines choice, convenience and a great location to watch the neighbouring light show.
5
This place just next to esplanade. You can see MBS from here when enjoy your dinner. Many choice and almost all stand have a good foods. One of my fav place when I visit Singapore.
5
It was my last night in Singapore, and I had planned to see the light show from the Merlion Park. Due to CNY, the place I was keen to eat Singapore Crab at was fully booked. I was then drawn to walk towards the esplanade lined with giant lanterns. Thus, I stumpled upon this food stall place, and I walked the full length keeping my eye out for crab. I settled on Rong Guang due to the affordable price. The wait time was quite long due to its popularity, and afraid to miss my flight, I was able to change my order to take away. 1.5 hours after getting the crab, returning to the hotel to collect my heavy bags, and making my way to the airport, I was quite famished, and sat at the airport to eat this crab. Hands down the best thing I ate whilst I was in Singapore! Gloves messied, sauce everywhere, and no doubt bypassers having a good stare at the crazy person eating crab at the airport, I was completely satisfied. Highly recommended, and next I return, I plan on eating at the market properly

My wife and I visited here last Sunday afternoon at opening time (4:00PM), at that time it was still relatively quiet.We shared one ‘XXL’ chilli crab between us from Redhill Rong Guang. It was quite tasty, but didn’t have the wow factor.The most annoying thing - the finished food plates left on the tables attracted far too many scavenging birds, making for an uncomfortable experience. Get your act together guys, and arrange to have tables cleared immediately (this applies to the entire food court, not just one food outlet)
4
This cafe is situated on the bay with several different types of cuisine. The famous chilly crab is served but many other dishes. quality.The tables are solid concrete with plastic chairs. Its a quick food bar really, with a constant flow of customers. Its self service, you select your food, get a tab and have to return occasionally to see if its finished.We had a selection of fish food mix on noodles, mixed rice and roast duck.All good quality
5
Small (around 8) outlets - Singaporean, Malay, Thai, food, dessert outlet and drinks.Eaten here 3 times so far during a 9 night stay - good fish, squid, chilli crab. Very good duck & duck rice. Beers from $5.Some may say it's a slightly sanitised version of older hawker centres, but there are lots of local using this place, the atmosphere is good and it's very convenient if you are staying at the Conrad, Marina Mandarin, Mandarin Oriental, or Pan Pacific hotels.Also very handy if you want to take a boat trip after dinner from Esplanade Pier, or stroll to the Helix Bridge to head over to the Marina Bay Sands hotel / Gardens by the Bay
2
We are Singaporean local, chance upon here for dinner. We had a few dishes but it was really hardly representative of Singapore food. Specifically, the oyster Or Luak was really a splatter of flour. Sambal Kangkong limpid. Fried chicken wing and fried Tung hoon passable. Nasi Goreng Kampung was cold. Wonder why we let down our visitors at such iconic and beautiful spot
5
A great place to eat. Lovely and cheap food. Lots of stalls to choose from. Open 5pm till 2am every night. Try wee nam kee. Three stalls in. Tried four different meals and only $13 for two. Also order a jug of tiger beer. Well worth a visit we loved it
4
It was really rainy when we visited, thus not so much people in the area. Get the chicken rice from Wee Nam Kee, the pad thai two/three stalls down, and the satay combo. The food here is cheaper than the other restaurants in the Esplanade, and if you are thirsty while eating, drinks are sold on the first stall or go to 7-11 back at the Esplanade. Overall a good stopover while touring the whole stretch from Merlion Park to Marina Bay Sands
4
Good local food experience for cheap price with great view on the Bay.
It gives a good idea of local food options - sea food, fried noodles.
A good introduction to the city and its mix of culinary culture.
4
Good selection of cheap eats from Chili crab to chicken rice. Everything was good but the satay is better at Lau Pa Sat.
4
Every time we stay in Singapore, we always try to grab a table at Makansutra Glutton Bay. The selection of food on offer here from Duck Fried Rice with Pancakes to Chilli Crab is incredible, not to mention value for money and delicious.
4
We were staying at the pan pacific hotel so this was a quick and easy option for us for dinner. We had fried carrot cake and chicken rice. Both were tasty and cheap.
5
We started off with a pleasant walk on a clear night along the riverfront to Gluttons Bay. The Gluttons Bay hawker area is bustling and good fun for the family. The food was also great and at good prices. After dinner, you can slowly amble around Marina Bay and the river watching lots of things. A really good way to spend the evenin
5
we got there about 8 pm. the place was puzzling with locals and tourists but there was lots table and great variety of food,not only local cuisine but also from other south eastern cuisine. we had some satay from one of the stalls which were tasty and authentic followed by some Thai food from other stall and freshly squeezed fruit juice. nice treat
4
Went for dinner and cannot complain one bit about the food on offer and that eaten. Whilst it looks busy and chaotic, the stalls have an organised way of working, providing you with fresh and tasty food, and incredibly cheap. The only issues were the fact you can only drink beer or soft drinks. A wine point might be a nice addition, along with nicer seating and lighting?... this wonâ€™t take away the hawker experience, just make it even more enjoyable.
5
Open air hawker type eatery, with about 20 stalls selling variety of Singaporean local hawker foods. To name a few there are chilli crab, samba sting rays, oyster omelette, Hainanese chicken rice, fried carrot cake, satay, ice kachang, che dolce etc. there countless amount of local dishes at reasonable prices. There are some seats around the edges that are undercover and also some tables and chairs open to the elements, so if it rains, it is best to find a table under cover. Plenty of food to tempt even the most fussiest of eater
3
Supposedly a hawker market of food stalls, although is a bit more sophisticated nowadays. Perhaps 20 different vendors, in a long row of stalls, with a large outside seating area with plastic tables and chairs, which you may have to share with others. One stall serves jugs of beer. Food covers a wide range of Asian cuisines, and everything we ate was very good. Order from whichever vendors you like the look of, and find somewhere to sit. Not particularly cheap, but is catering to the tourists rather than locals. Good fun
4
It is worth visiting! It is clean (no puddle or dirty floor), very nice view (Marina bay as background), positive vibe, food is absolutely yummy, plating is good (not a watery and oily plates and cutleries kind), different than common hawker centres. Obviously the management has selected the vendors/kiosks who are allowed to sell here. Not to mention, price is also good like in a normal hawker centres
4
This place has lots of delicious, Indeed a good meal paired with amazing view. I came here at 7 pm. even it is crowded we stil get a seat. Halal food is also available here.
5
Booked bali but stranded in Singapore, been back 3 nights and it's a good place with nice and fresh food.
5
This place has lots of delicious, oh-so yummy yet affordable food choices.Indeed a good meal paired with amazing view.
4
Had supper here after a movie. I must say that there's a wide variety of local food here at reasonable prices even though it is located at a tourist area. Certainly cheaper than the same available at Lau Pa Sat and the place has a better view. Moreover, visitors can always go for a nice walk at the Esplanade after a meal
4
This Hawkers Center was not as cheap as others we had been to. I imagine it's because of it's location right on the water. My husband & I shared a fish and a stingray dinner along w/shrimp rice. The stingray was a little tough. All the tables were full but we managed to share a space with some strangers that had two empty chairs at their table. After they left we shared their chairs with some other people that needed a table to eat at. The best part of dinner was the view of the bay. Incredible. I'm sure you'd be paying a lot of money elsewhere for dinner with a view like we had. As we finished we heard music playing close by on the esplanade. There turned out to be a show with Indian musicians and dancers. We managed to find 2 empty seats and were able to enjoy the free program. If you research you can find out what the entertainment schedule is ahead of time
2
We had seafood from the last store closest the Bay, the barbecued prawns were so dry till it tasted like dried prawns. Crabs were good though but the fried rice was very very average. Barbecue sting ray was also over done, the lady replaced the prawns. Don’t ever try the Hokkien fried noodles. It didn’t even taste like it. Greasy and the prawns were so tasteless. Barbecued chicken wings were just so so. Expected it to be expensive but good. What a let down! Malan sutra????!??? Go figure. A place only good for tourists who are not familiar with Singaporean food
3
Reasonably good choice of food and quite good standard. Think it is a bit pricey but thats probably as it is central and they are going for the tourists. Satay was good but quite a wait to get it. Choose carefully what time you go, as it gets very busy and difficult to find a table
4
It's pretty crowded if you came during dinner time, we suggest an early dinner to avoid the crowd. It's perfect timing for us after taking a stroll on the bridge of merlion park. View dishes we recommend: chilli crab, satay, carrot cake, chicken wings, and for drinks: the calamansi with plum very refreshing! Cheaper option because the restaurant around this area are pretty expensive because you get the view of the bay
1
Seriously poor. Plays off the name and location. Ate at the stall according to the signage selling oyster omelette with no starch! Utter lies, counted 5 oysters and huge dollops of corn starch. Disgusting. Roast chicken wings next door, marginally better but tough and tasteless. Fried turnip dish was adequate. Won't be going back
5
Eat here 3 nights out of 5 and if you like the Asian kitchen, you have to go here. Don't worry about hygene, it is good and up to standard. If you want to combine like saté from stall 1 with the rice from a second, all is possible. Find a table to yourself, or just sit at long tables between the locals and enjoy.Prices are very resonable for Singapore standard
4
A little bit pricey but it's worth it.
There are lots of food selection to choose from.
Location is near in Marina Bay Hotel.
Date of visit: November 10, 2017
Type of visit: Couple with friends
4
Foodmarket, Foodcourt, Hawkersplace.what else do you need.
Cheap delicious food in all sizes and scents!!
Good. Cheap and nice scenic View.
Not too many stores but fair enough👌
Would go again 4/5
5
Trying the roasted chicken rice here. The food was delicious, and somewhat cheap. It is better if you visit this place at night, as the weather will be tolerable.
3
Very busy and popular hawker stalls but we were disappointed with the limited range of vegetarian options. What we had was inexpensive and tasty though.
4
Recently visited the makansutra after strolling around near Merlion and Marina Bay Sands. The place is outdoor with numerous amount of sitting and tables. Tables are well-built you don’t need to worry of spoiled drinks or food unlike the plastic table one.Food and beverage came in much kind, mostly seafood and melayu cuisine. Satay and roti prata are good. Favorite to be visit at night because the view is Marina Bay Sands. Lovely place
5
We were taken here by friends on our first night for dinner. The stands had all the usual things expected food drink and dessert wise and did not disappoint. We arrived early in the evening but as it went on it looked like seating might be difficult if you arrive later on. We all had great meals and a great time out
4
On first night when looking for a quick bit of food, fiancée and I came here. There are 12-15 food places and a drinks bar, Gluttons.We went to the duck place, which lets you know when dinner is ready by a buzzer. My duck wings were cooked in a very nice sauce (rich flavour, slightly spicy) but quite thin and not a huge amount. Also at an outdoor eatery I could have chosen more sensibly as hands got very sticky! Fiancée's duck noodle dish was a bit more bland but I thought a nice cut of meat (she let me have a third of it). With 2 soft drinks from Gluttons, total price S$21.30.You sit on plastic tables under a cover, the place could probably sit over 500. All in all it makes for a nice and relatively informal atmosphere.We went back here on second night also and shared 20 Satay Pieces (of differing types) from another place. I'd say this was slightly better than the first night.Singapore isn't the cheapest place and this is one to try out if on a budget
4
Lots of choice on food and flavours from different cultures. Price ranges from cheap to more expensive depending on ingredients. Friendly and fun atmosphere and then a beautiful walk to either the Marina Sands gardens or along the rivers edge. If you are looking to stay away from restaurant eating but want good quality food, then this is the place. Open from 5pm to 1am
4
Always love going to this place especially at night time.There will always be some event happening outside the Esplanade and then you can have a good seafood dinner here...Gets crowded on weekends so may be difficult to get a table...But it's awesome to sit here in the open and have good food and drinks..
5
My partner and I walked here our first night in Singapore and was a great introduction. The place was packed of tables on a private road with a real buzzing atmosphere of both locals and tourists. We walked up and down looking at all the stands which offered a great variety of local dishes at reasonable prices. We both received great sized portions and a surprisingly quick service. The night was topped off with live music literally next to the place and a panoramic view
4
We had 4 nights in Singapore we ate here for 3 dinners , yummy satay, noodles, spring rolls every thing was good 👍 gets very very busy take your own napkins, prices are very good for food & drinks😊
4
Amazingly tasty local food! The ambience is great, food is awesome and view is wonderful. Prices are slightly higher than average hawkers, but totally worth it.
4
For a great range of foods and a refreshing beer this is the place to eat. It's a buzz of activity and always full of people.
4
Good place to meet, as it overlooks the bay. Bustling area of centrally located seating, with a number of restaurants serving food, and more importantly, beer. Relaxed and filled with happy workers enjoying a Friday evening drink after work. Tables are fitted with umbrellas with fans running permanently underneath to keep air moving, and give the impression of being cool. Food is very good, and relatively inexpensive by Singaporean standards anyway. Only down side is predatory waitresses who keep topping up my glass, despite me saying no, obviously with the intention of selling me another jug....which worked once until I realised what was happening, and held onto my glass. Loses a star because of this
5
It's my second time to eat here and meetup with family and friends in SG. The food is affordable and serving size is outstanding!The view of Esplanade bay overlooking the Marina Bay lights show is outstanding. A must-visit after the mandatory pic at the Merlion
4
Good local food in an out door location right on the bay! We were recommended this eating place by Singaporeans we met in Europe! It appeared to be popular to locals and visitors. There are approximately 10 different types of food stalls to choose from. The outlook across the bay to Marina Sands was a plus
5
We have eaten here a few times with our children and we all loved it. The satay is excellent and the four of us can easily eat 30 pieces! There are also other great stalls with great food such as pad Thai noodles and rice dishes. Good choice of beverages too. It doesn't open until 5pm and can get busy but is definitely worth going to
3
I’d hoped for more to be honest, especially after walking forever to get there, but alas no. I ordered the Char Kwao Teo, which was passable. I had hoped for Haienese Chicken Rice but didn’t see on any vendors lists. Best part of visit was post-food when looking at Marina Bay, views make up for the food.
5
Every time I tour around my relatives and friends who visit Singapore, this is a must dinner affair. Almost, if not all, of Singapore food fare is right here. Variety is aplenty-- satay, bbq sting ray, chicken wings, prawn noodles, crispy baby squid, cereal prawn, chili crab, black pepper crab, carrot cake, chicken rice, laksa, hor fun, sugarcane juice.. the list goes on and on...A little bit pricey compared to the normal hawker centre you see below the HDB-- you have to pay a bit for the ambiance--to feel that touristy vibe... Make sure you arrive early before dinner time--it's very difficult to find a seat that has a very good view of Marina Bay.. If you're lucky, you can watch the MBS laser show while having your feast and gulping down your favourite drink
4
Great location on Marina Bay itself... to get hawker food albeit slightly more expensive than typical hawker centre was a real plus. I mean you can’t beat the view while eating chicken wings and satay ... definitely worth a visit tho time it after the sun goes down and find a seat under one of the many fans ..
4
Easy, beautiful location to get the view of Marina bay & local Singapore street food. Lots of tourists & locals here for the good food & happening atmosphere of street food!
5
Best satay I have ever tasted. Tried chicken beef and mutton. All 3 were unbelievable. Place was spotless. Staff friendly. Location with view was second to none. Will definitely be back.
3
I went there to have chili crab..I got one chili crab from Rong Guang for $16. Horrible...All I tasted was sugar ketchup soaked small crab.
I only tried this place so not a fair judgement of this place but other Hawker markets had more choices.
5
It was great, had some BBQ stingray and a big plate of satay and an ice cold jug of Tiger beer...👍🍻
3
We walked along the river to here from our hotel at Clarke Quay (which seemed quite far in the end, though it was a really pretty view of the city and Marina Bay Sands building).On arrival, it was semi-chaotic trying to secure a table. There were loads of people queuing for food at each stall and even more sitting eating. Possibly 60/40 split of locals/tourists. We surprised ourselves and grabbed a table within about 5 mins. The duck fried rice was good $10-. As was the char kway teow at $9-. The satay was enjoyable. And we finished with an ice kachang shared with my 9yo (he would have happily had it all).I did feel really hot the whole time as there was no air circulation where we sat. Overall a good experience but would t rush back.
4
A little bit touristy, but it's nice to come here at least once while you're in Singapore . Where can you eat hawker food with such a 5 star view! Food is a little more expensive than you're local hawker centre, I think they may have put the prices up a little during F1 nights. Satay was yummy
4
i just drop in there for snacking, after dinner.Overlooking Marina Bay Sand, the view is great at night.I only order chicken wing from Huat Huat stall, and the taste is just ok.I recommend this place for the view, not for the food.You can see my travel picture at my Instagram : @adjimantor
5
The food is above average and it has a great laidback atmosphere with a city (MBS, marina) postcard view. Food is affordable and the meal will average $10-$20 per pax if you order satay etc (seafood meals will be more expensive). Stalls open till after midnight and it is wonderful to walk/cycle around after a meal to burn some calories. One can walk to the barrage or towards the Domes or back to MBS
5
We were staying nearby and decided to give this place a try and were really glad that we did. There are a number of stalls all selling different food including Thai and Indonesian dishes, as well as beer. Dishes are around 8 SGD each but hot and plentiful. You can easily find a seat and it seems to be popular with the locals. The pad Thai was amazing as was the satay
5
Hands down amazing place, amazing food, amazing view! Reasonable prices and a wide variety of foods to choose from. Tourists must try the chili crab and satay!! <3 <3 <3 Best to have dinner and watch the sunset. If you're lucky, you'll also be treated to live music from the open-air stage nearby
4
Overlooking the Marina Bay area while dining with my family. A lot of food selections and the satay was delicious with fresh coconut juice
4
Great ambience, good food - wide variety of food - seafood and poultry, decent price. Really loved the atmosphere.
5
Love love this place. Whenever we are in Singapore this is our first night out. Tiger Beer, Chilli Crab and Satay Sticks. This place is right in the heart of the Marina Bay area, so after your meal take a stroll around the river..
5
We've been to Singapore twice now and this place is always a must do !
Delicious food and great prices, such great variety and as soon as your done you can walk 20m to enjoy the beautiful views of the bay.
4
Every tourist must visit this place! - Place is kept well. There are cleaners waiting to clear the table for the next diner.- Variety of food - from chicken rice, roti prata, satay to seafoods, local deserts. They have it!- Price is ok ok....not as expected to be a "tourist rate". Maybe a little pricey compared to normal hawker
4
Came here for the first time, tried the chicken wings. I ordered 10 wings, turns out they cut it into two so I have 20 pieces! It was totally worth it. It might be a little bit hard if it's raining but if it's not, it's a bit windy so will refreshen you. Have a little walk to have Marina Bay Sands and Helix Bridge night view. Verrry niiiice
3
This is either a great place for seafood diners (enjoy waterfront views) or a place to avoid if you are vegetarian. If you are a meat eating tourist looking for a local experience then highly recommend one visit here at night.Went here along with a friend who relished the crab dishes but as a vegetarian there was absolutely nothing for me to eat. So I only had coconut water. Wish there is at least one stall in the future that caters to non meat eating people as I would love to go back
5
if i want to have that touristy feel in a very nice outdoor place... where a lot of new people are introduced to Singapore thru their food and a lot them are walking around continuously choosing which food to eat or probably looking for seat.. and from a far you could hear an Esplanade culture flavour of the month performance just by the bay... i go out here because i work just across the street.. ambience is really lively. but i must warn you that some of their food are quite expensive... for a full heavy meal with drinks you could be spending around 15 to 20sgd already. selection is good enough to taste the basic singapore flavour! lucky enough to have a filipino food in the options as well (Gerrys grille!!) highly recommended food place for tourists who walk around the city near Esplanade, marina bay area, MBS, Suntec, CBD, national gallery, flyer, etc..
4
We went for late supper at Makansutra Glutton's Bay after watching a wonderful musical - Forbidden City: Portrait of an Empress at Esplanade theatre last night. The food centre is just a stone throw away from the theatre, and they offer a good choices of local food. From chicken rice, satay, prata to seafood. It's a nice place to chill out in the evening with great atmosphere and decent food
4
Glutton's is the ONLY waterfront restaurant with a reasonable price around the marina!!!Here are some BIG TIPS FOR BIG FELLAS trying to impress friends on a budget with LOCAL FOOD, without compromising all your STRUGGLE!!!Fried sweet potato leaf with belachan (don't first shop as you enter, chilli will SPEED UP METABOLISM and the leafy greens are PACKED FULL OF IRON)!!!Sambal stingray (probably the most famous dish here, known to PROMOTE MUSCLE GROWTH and DESTROY RECOVERY TIME)!!!Black carrot cake (for your CARB LOADING, actually radish - there is no carrot in SG carrot cake)!!!Fried chicken wings (2 each will probably do for your PROTEIN, unless you are looking for MAD GAINZ, in which case you might want 8)!!!A bowl of rice each (OR NONE AT ALL)!!!Beer is $20 a jug. Get one of the cute PROMO GIRLS to run it for you!!
3
This hawker centre is a little more pricey than the others but the location is the best. Located right next to the Harbour so it has great views. Only about 10-12 stands so not a ton to choose between overall a nice place.
4
This is not the best nor the most authentic hawker food ... and besides that it's quite expensive, but it is still good fun to eat here after a visit to eg Merlion.
5
Great value and amazing food with lots of options to choose from and a great view out over the bay. Definitely get there early (and take your own tissues) as it gets very busy but don't visit Singapore without eating here.
4
An easy walk from Raffles. Lots to choose from, we had hainan Chicken. Duck noodle and satay, all very good, all great value. Beer available, nice setting.
5
Certianly worth a vist when in Singapore apparently runs every night a great selection of food to choose from wonderful friendly vendors and some great food and very resonable prices and if you are there before 6.30 you should have no trouble getting a table but no later and if you go down the far end you will have a view of Marina Bay Sands while enjoying your meal and had a lovely lady serving our table with drinks
5
The Makansutra Glutton's Bay is a must-visit food-court in Singapore. If you, like me, love great food, this is the place to go. A bit pricy compared to the more "local" markets around, the quality of the food (at least of that I ate) is simply amazing. The other extreme benefit of this hawker is the location - just across the water of the Marina Bay, you can walk here when spending time at the Marina Bay (or just take a taxi if you are lazy!) I had the Black Pepper Crab at one of the stalls (number four stall if counting from the water-side), with fried noodles, rice and some green leafs. The crab is one of the best crabs I have ever had (I have had crab on four continents so far...), and the green leafs with chili was a perfect match. The seafood noodles had a magic draw that made me eat it all...The rice was the only dish I could not finish, even if I loved the smoky taste. Beer is found at the beer-stall (or just look for someone wearing a Tiger t-shirt). The place is very crowded, and mostly with tourists, but even then the food is of much higher quality than what I expect for a touristy place like this. Will I be back? Definitively
4
In the evenings this place becomes jam packed and thus the locals demonstrate with the feet that the place is good. The biggest challenge is finding somewhere to sit down. I suggest you hang around find the table first and then post a lookout to keep the table while another goes and look at the food options. There is a lot of focus from the stalls pushing the very expensive crabs, but forking out $60 for a crab that is then cooked in a little stall is probably not the best use of your money. Plenty of other food will leave only the very fussy eater with nothing to find. We sat at one of the long communal tables and found it easy to talk to the people we were sat with. Very friendly area
3
I had heard great things about this place and decided to visit for dinner one evening. After looking around through a small selection of stalls, I went ahead and ordereda kway tweo with shrimp at a eatery. My food was very average and the tables being close to each other caused the whole ambience to be very hot. In my opinion, there are nicer Hawker centers than this on
1
We read in the TripAdvisor that the place is on top 10 list for halal food which is unfortunately not. Only 2 shops offered halal food while the rest with no sign at all. It is a place with many hawkers selling food I supposed that it is a good spot for Seafood hunters because we saw crowd of people enjoying their meal there. Unfortunately for us, with the 2 stalls nothing much we could say. Our meal was terrible and the seller also not so friendly. Food served was not as in the picture displayed
4
I ordered satay, the second stall from its front entrace and I really recommend it! Anyway, if you want to find this place, find Esplanade mall. It's on the mall's front left side, after Toast Box. It is really crowded, so I guess people really love eating there
5
I did indeed feel like a glutton as we chose from all the delicious local foods at gluttons bay. We ended up choosing beer, duck pancakes, and pork dumplings in broth. Great place to enjoy food right by the water.
5
Worth doing, food is just great- redhill rong guang (end store) satay joint is great too. View is awsome. Get there 5-6pm fills up quick
5
I never thought that dining out on street is for me. Until I've tried at this famous diners haven.There are plenty of cuisines & dishes to choose from & It never fails to satisfy our taste buds.We tried their Chinese cuisines & we can't seem to take anymore.The price is affordable & the servings are quite huge
4
I liked it there. Since I was a tourist, i did not have much to compare it from in terms of the prices. Was not able to go to other "hawker types". Some of the food was bland...lacked taste but as I would say better that way than tasting salty or something else. We had chilli crab, bbq prawns, squid... i would go back there the next time i go back to Singapore
3
About five to ten mins stroll from Singapore Flyer .. Nothing fancy if you didn't manage to get a table by the water. All other seats near to the road are indifferent from a Hawker stall. The food are regular Hawker standard with a hefty price tag. **This is a no smoking facility*
3
The view from this food court was "million dollars" worth as you could see the bay, the Merlion, Marina Bay Sands and Singapore Financial Centre. Food was ok, not as excellent as expected. Price was very expensive, maybe twice in comparison with the other hawk centres that we had experienced. But in overall, it was a nice try for us
2
Very good view to MBS and the sky scrappers. Arrived there at 6 pm and got a table for three easily. It has only 10 stalls, if I'm not wrong. We looked around and chose chicken satay, fried tofu in satay sauce, hokkien mie, and rice with olive. The taste is so-so. We certainly will not come back again.
5
This is one of our favourite Hawker places in Singapore.Easy to get to as it is centrally located to main attractions, and transport.We found a seat then hunted for food.Enjoyed the chicken wings, Pad Thai and the BBQ squid. Washed down with a jug of beer. All up it was about S$60. Watched the sun set reflected on MBS.Do try it
5
After a long and tiring day at universal studios. this is a good place to cheat lol. there's a lot of food to choose only one. yummy and affordable. its also a chance to get socialize. hahaha. because there's so many tourists the bad thing is no chairs and tables were available at that time. so you had to ask or share with others. for the view well theres the flyer and the esplanade mall
4
We hunt down new and go to our favourite Hawker centers every time we come to Singapore. We visited here last night, and was pleasantly surprised it's not massive but has about 20 stalls it has a great vibe and is a little more expensive than Maxwell's and others I glace been to in the past , the food looked ok, we had duck wraps and dumplings which had a hint of dishwater taste which wasn't pleasant, the duck was ok but expensive for what we got, this place is ok for late night eats but wouldn't rush to go back
1
Fun place to eat but this is not in Bugis folks! Not sure why it is listed here. This is hawker style food, busy, noisy, not very clean, a it expensive for what it is really.
4
A taste of SG cuisine. There are lots of choices. Great food. Most tourists flock to Gluttons Bay and it gets crowded during dinner time. Plus factor is the stunning view of Marina Bay. Thumbs up!
5
Get a taste of a great variety of famous local street food when you are around the Marina Bay, Merlion Park tourist attractions.
Do come here preferably for dinner as it is outdoors and can be very hot during the day.
4
Very good food and broad variety of choices at a good price. Very busy but that only adds to the atmosphere. View is beautiful. Wide choice of Asian dishes. Real Asian style: just order and take to your dish.
5
Had a great meal with cold beer. The pepper crab was amazing. Easy to get a table and quick turn around for freshly cooked food.

I was at the Esplanade for a performance last Saturday, so the weekend crowd at this outdoor joint was massive at about 8.30pm! I am not sure how you would manage to find a table for a large group, unless you go REALLY early. I was alone so I walked through the joint from the direction of the sea to the road, "scanned" thoroughly for a vacant seat, and asked the lovely Aussie ladies if I could sit on the empty stool at their table. They agreed. I scooted off to buy my bowl of chendol (shaved ice in coconut milk dessert) for S$2.50. It was not exactly ideal for a meal but there was no Q (I was being practical). I am not sure what is the hype of this place. All the effort to find a table, q for food, pay double the usual price, and eat outdoor, perspiring in the humidity ... Why don't you just hop over to Marina Square food court? Or take a cab to Old Airport hawker center for authentic local food at local price
3
A lot variation of foods, from chicken rice to chilli crab.The chicken rice stall was delicious, and i also tried the roti prata stall.The ambience was nice to consider for trying hawker food stalls other than the usual indoor foodcourt.The place is just beside the esplanade and across marina bay sands.
3
This Hawker Centre is conveniently located near to the Esplanade and Marina Bay, there are around a dozen stalls here selling local food and drinks. The food is fairly good, but I found a few dishes way too salty - maybe I just picked the wrong stalls. It also sadly doesn't have that true "street food vibe" like you get in Bangkok or Penang. I guess regulations are tighter in Singapore which means they have to be more legit
4
Went for dinner here, I had the satay and the wife who is a vegetarian had some noodles. Good clean food, service is about 10 minutes given everything is usually freshly made. Lots of options, especially seafood. Easy to find and tasty. Well priced with cold beer
5
A great location near Marina Bay, this is the place to grab a great bite to eat, with many many options. We had satay and prawns one night, an Chilli Crab another. It gets crowded at peak time, so i'd suggest eat a bit later, think its open til midnight. Casual and relaxed, and food is cooked fresh. Drinks available an really good dessert stall as well. Looking for a cheap fresh eat, in outdoors and close to the Marina Bay area, Better than eating in one of the many many indoor eating areas in Singapore
5
This food center is very famous for good-taste food menu!
Every shop has a masterpiece-food, especially Peking Duck SS$24 is very good!
This menu contains 10-piece-Peking Duck covered with PANCAKE!
Other shops also have masterpiece-menu, so you can enjoy eating!
マカンスートラは、ガイドブックでもお馴染みで、多数の観光客とシンガポール居住の方で、いつも大変混み会っています。各店舗には、自慢の名物料理があり、どれをたべても概ね、いわゆるハズレはありません。北京ダックの有名な店では、パンケーキにくるまれていますが、そのお味は、なかなかです！チキンウイング、ミーゴレン（真っ赤）のお店も大人気です。
5
It is my first time to visit Singapore and my cousin told me that I should try to eat in makansutra. I really love their dishes because I am a seafood lover. I will go back there next time I visit SG again.
3
A short row of about a dozen stalls selling typical local dishes. Some dishes are served in large portions. So, don't go alone.
The premium delicacies here would be the popular Chilli Crabs. If there's a good crowd, go for it.
5
A visit to Singapore and not having food at one of the hawker center, you are missing out. Makansutra, nice ambiance with so much choice that you just want to have everything. The fried oyster (O Chien), satay, chicken wing, Singapore hokkien noodles, you just can't get enough. Now back to Sydney and I'm already homesick for these food.One of the must try hawker center when you are Singapore
5
My wife and I visited Gluttons Bay hawker market on a Thursday evening around 6.30pm. We struggled to find a seat at first. We had some Chinese style chicken wings (good) and some black 'carrot cake' (which we later found out to be rice flour with eggs and was delicious) with some satay and a pad Thai to share afterwards. Overall very reasonably priced. We would definitely return.Â
5
Singapore trip wont be complete not unless you eat here. It opens when the sun goes down until midnight. After a walk at Merlion Park, a dinner at this place is the best choice. There are numerous stalls cooking satay, hainanese chicken, chili crab, baby squid, and mee siam. Some stalls offer cold cane juice and coconut juice as well. A stall which is another favorite of our family is the ice kachang stall. Some food booths offer cold local beers too.  Makansutra is a budget - friendly eating place which makes it very popular , crowded and noisy specially on weekends and holidays. Bring extra tissue and wet ones or better yet wash your hands to enjoy eating with bare hands.
3
The most entertaining part of the evening was hunting for a free table, as we came quite late in the evening. You just keep watching people until they get uncomfortable and leave - the only strategy to find a seat. We tried various Singaporean staples throughout the night, including the classic chicken rice. It was pretty good and loved chicken flavored rice, but by the time you get it from the stall to the table, it's already cold.
4
Be warned - it's busy and an experience. Finding a table can be challenging but you get to make new friends. A good tip is to bring hand wipes an tissues as lots of the food u need to eat with your fingers. The Satay and chicken wings are amazing and the noodles also good. Not as well organised or good as the night food markets in Bangkok but worth a visit in Singapore
2
I chose food from one of the stalls closest to the water, and was terribly disappointed. In particular, the soft shell crab which looked good on the sample dish, was entirely different....rather than small crabs with a small amount of batter, I was given mainly batter, with some small chunks of crab hidden in some of it. There was certainly no whole crab. Some chunks of batter appeared to just be batter and nothing else.So, choose carefully, or have the courage to take things back if they don't meet expectations (it was my first night in Singapore, I was feeling a little timid).In terms of setting, I had expected a large area and bustling crowd, but it's really just a single short strip of stalls, with not much atmosphere at all, even though all the tables were full
5
Popped down from Marina Bay shoppes by accident and have to say pleasantly surprised with the layout, food options and atmosphere. Multiple options for all the Singaporean staples (carrot cake, kuay teow, chilli crab, rice), we settled on roti prata, satay, nasi goreng and kang kong. All was as good as anything I've had in Singapore, served quick and not too busy environment. Will definitely return and recommend this place for casual eats in Marina Bay Area
4
This place is not as cheap as the regular hawker stalls but it is tourist-friendly because of its proximity to the Bay. We enjoyed the cereal prawns a lot and the fried bread on sticks.
5
This is the easy safe entry to Asian street food. Clean organized and absolutely packed out for to the selection of stunning Asian food, beer and great sights sounds and smells.
Just give it a try.... good food pretty cheap and loads of fun
4
For moeslem travelers, choose Sate Padang Alhambra. Highly recommmended. Delicious! Very crowded in weekend dinner time.
4
A great place to eat by the bay. Many different choices of food, and the most fantastic view overlooking The Marina Bay Sands Hotel.
A good experience to eat outside, in a crowdy place!
4
When we want to walk around the Marina Bay Area in the evening, Makansutra is the place we eat. One of our things to do in Singapore is to take in the evening city skyline and walk from the Esplanade to the Helix bridge. Having a meal at this place is convenient. Early in the evening when we went, it was still possible to get a table right away. We ordered from Alhambra Padang Satay, and it was good. Other food is available from the hawker stall styled places lined up
5
This is a nice hidden gem near the Esplanade! The food is authentic and reasonably priced. It was all so delicious and would definitely recommend to any visitors followed by a walk along the Marina. It is a great set up with heaps of tables, very family friendly and a great social location.
4
Hawker centres are Singaporean authentic experience. While the hawker food offered in Gluttonâ€™s Bay is not the best in Singapore, they are all good and reasonably priced.I love the oyster omelette, char kwee tiaw and chilli crab. I got them all from different stalls. The cold sugar cane juice is perfect for hot and humid night. Or the cold Tiger beer tower.It is hard to beat the location: right next to the Esplanade and by Singapore river. Plus it opens until 3am
5
The only complaint here was finding a seat, even at 9 the place was packed. We had the best roti prata (so good we went twice) of the trip and some great fragrant rice. There were so many options but most things had enough of a description that you could tell what you were eating.
4
Went there on a Friday night with some local friends.At 8 pm it was already packed and we had to wait 20 mins before finding a table for 4.We indulged in satays, carrot cake, char kway teow, oyster omelette and prawn paste chicken wings, all washed down with various sweet & colourful local drinks.It's cheap, hot & bustling, but great fun to experience the local hawker food tradition even if it is geared a little towards to the tourist market
5
Affordable food with lots of variety from Filipino foods (Jerry's Grill) to Indian and Malay foods. Good location as it is beside the Esplanade Mall and walking distance from the flyer, marina, merlion, concert area, gardens by the bay, and after you eat you can walk in the area
5
There is every option you'd want at this hawker centre. The food isn't the best in Singapore, it isn't the cheapest in Singapore, but the location and view you get whilst you're eating is well worth it!
5
A must place to eat after seeing the Merlion and walking through the Helix Bridge. You'll find a huge of variety of delicious food and different cuisine to choose from.
5
I always come back here when in town. Yes it is touristy and more expensive than a normal hawker but the quality is good and the location too. Have some satay, roti prata, char koay teow, stingray and so on...
4
As for me it's one of the best Hawker Centre in Singapore. I've been in few already but this is really nice. It's everytime crowded there because the variety and taste of the food is very delicious! For me definitely a hot spot.
4
A nice place for Singapore Street food close to Marina Bay Sands. There are several dozen of shops selling a variety of food. The food can be really oily. Also at evenings, the place can be very crowded.
4
All tourists and locals alike flock together here to eat quality, affordable meals. Although its really crowded, the food here were all nice. Definitely a place to bring my tourist friend to.
4
Stopped here for a quick and cheap hawker meal. Mainly had sate chicken and roti. All good without being exceptional. Slightly dearer than Newtons but still cheap. Only beer and juice available at a fair price. Also under cover which is good news for a wet night. Great views from the nearby waterfront of Marina Bay and Helix bridge
3
Was at Suntec and decided to check out Glutton's Bay for quick and simple dinner. Ordered medium portion of fried hokkien mee $7 and oysters omelette $8 from Soon Lee. Both are good but lack "wok hei" (wok heat). Considerably cheap given the portion size and the location
4
This is a small hawkers centre, next to the National Theatres. Armadillos? Durians? Armadurians? Apparantly, the stalls were hand picked by a Singapore food blogger. Despite the small size, there is a good range of choices, and it is certainly a place to return to, as the view is fantastic, with the city, Marina Bay, and Marina Bay Sands as your dining room backdrop. We shared two small chilli crabs from Redhill Rong Guang BBQ Seafood (the stall nearest the bay) for $30, mopped up the juices with fried buns ($3) and fried rice ($4), and washed it down with cold Tiger. Delightful
4
There are a different varieties to choose from in an affordable price. The locals or those who works here in the country bring their tourists, relatives & friends who visit them here in Makansutra. However, tables are always full because there's quite a lot of people who are eating here specially dinner. It's a little awkward when you are almost done eating, then there is a group of people waiting beside you to stand.. Here you can taste Singapore's favorite foods such as Chili crab, shrimp, carrot cake, satay & veggies. Just don't forget to bring your own water & tissue if are on a budget!!
4
Located close to the bay, this road has a very good range of small food outlets all specialising in various local food styles.
Busy during our visit with locals which underlines it's reputation for great quality food at reasonable prices. Highly recommended for evening experience.
5
Much cleaner hawker stall, with such a nice location. You're within walking distance from MBS, or to Clarke Quay after. A little bit of everything. Great place for dinner!
4
A long established institution, the eating area is not large, seating can be difficult, but the food stalls all serve very good quality food, freshly prepared and at reasonable prices. On my last visit I ordered a chilli crab and was able to chose its size, determined by its price. My wife had pork rolls and with a noodle dish and beers our meals cost about $60. This is dear by some market standards but compensated for by the size and quality of the portions. Definitely worth a visit
4
Visited here on a Friday evening and the place was very busy. All the tables are outside and we managed to grab a couple of seats to eat or satay. The mixed satay we had was very tasty and the peanut sauce made it even better. Great selection of Asian food and drinks.There were many families eating here and the atmoshere was electric
4
Food market right on the Bay with great views of the Marina Bay Sands, the Merlion. Several stalls selling the famous Singapore chilli crab, dumplings, satay sticks etc. Across the road from several hotels i.e. Mandarin Oriental, Pan Pacific. Easy walk to several bay attractions such as Helix Bridge, Singapore Flyer, Merlion, Bumboats. Food is reasonable priced and a Tiger beer was less than $5. Great lychee drink & the chilli crab was hot
4
Travelled to expensive Singapore with my husband and was looking for cheap eats. Makansutra Glutton's Bay is a clean hawker market with a selection of authentic Singaporean eats at reasonable prices. Food was delicious and authentic - Chilli crab was spicy unlike that tried at Chinatown (milder to suit European tastes) and the Peking duck with pancakes was also exceptionally good. Very busy and you need to employ the Singaporean method of leaving an item on any available table to ensure that you can get a seat
5
This hawker place is probably a step up from the usual. A bit more expensive but we liked it so much that we came here three times on different nights. One of our favourites was the Magestic Peking Duck stall with the best pork dumplings (we love our dumplings) and beautiful crispy sweet and sour pork. The duck wings were also good. The satays at Alhawa Padang Satay also delicious, especially with the spicy peanut sauce. The Mee Goreng from another stall was also very nice. We usually got to Makansutra fairly late for dinner (around 9p) and found no problem in finding somewhere to sit. It's in a great location and nice to go for a walk afterwards, you might even catch another light show
4
I came here mainly for the satay, beautiful chicken, beef and lamb satay sticks with peanut sauce. I don't eat sea food but must admit that the crab looked amazing too- think it's a local delicacy. Plenty of choice at reasonable prices. Try get a table that's under cover for if/when it rains.
4
I soent quite a while trying to find somewhere that provided ocal street food and at reasonable prices. The beer prices here are better than most bars and you have a wide variety of food to choose from. I understand that prices here are more expensive than other Hawker areas further away from the city centre, but when you're around this part of the city, then not a bad place at all. Each Haweker stall provides a different style of food. If you're new to all this, then it might prove a little bot of a lottery - as it was for me, but I wasn't disappointed with my Singapore noodles. The only thing was the portion was most filling and I couldn't think of eating more food - so that can't be bad
5
Went there to eat with friends in the evening, and since it's located near the bay, there is a nice breeze and good vibe.There are many local food shops around so i didn't find myself without anything to eat.If you are hungry, this is a recommended place
3
The food was ok but not great. We visited the place during a trip to Asia. We like Asian food. Not sure we will visit it agatin.
5
It was definitely a good drop by for a dinner with wide variety and selection of food. The pineapple fried rice and the chilli crab is a must try.
4
If you want cheap eats in Singapore this is one of the places. Though it's not cheap by Southeast Asia's standards, it is for Singapore. There is a variety of options although not much for vegetarian people, only Indian.
4
If you want cheap but great street food then visit here. Also by the river, free theatres, river/city views. About $10 per person, with plates and somewhere to sit.
5
A great spot for some Satay, Gado Gado & a cold beer on the harbour front watching dusk fall & the lights come on all around the bay.
3
We love Satay and Noodles but both were just okay; have had way better. I would give it another go if in the area but try different stalls.
4
Wide selection of foods. Experience different hawker foods while viewing the Singapore skyline along Marina bay.
4
Wanted to experience Hawker street food and was not disappointed. Was very busy but efficient in getting food out. The Singapore black pepper crab was great, the chilli crab wasn't as good, I've had better.
The satay was very nice.
3
Easy to locate for tourist after site visits at Marina Bay/Square. Partially sheltered thus business/crowd is at the mercy of the weather. Good selection but may not be able to find all local dishes. Common dishes like chili crab, satay, chicken wings, stingrays, carrot cake etc are available. Did not find any popiah, chwee kuey, mee bok etc here, probably because of the limited space for hawkers.Think the price is a bit steep for the dishes vs portions. Taste of the varies dishes - subjective but personally feels some dishes are not up to expectation
4
I ate sweet Chinese soup and Chili Crab here. Here is fair value and very crowded. And very near Marina bay about 1 minutes by walk. Crab soup was very good, more than famous restaurant which i came before. 25$ 1crab for 1 people. I liked it
4
Street food prices with a view? Gluttons bay is exactly that. With choices of over a dozen places to eat with everything from all sizes of Singapore Chilly Crab and Carrot cakes, this is a foodie paradise!
4
Nice food court outside by the water. Many choices of cusine from all asia. Nice prices for food and drinks and you get your food quickly. Remember to bring tissues!
5
Wow what a wonderful experience. Killer food, great pricing and great environment. Don't forget to bring your own napkins. Walk off your meal along the boardwalk, grab a coconut ice cream and watch the light show.
2
I an a local and frankly, the food is overpriced, or what we would consider "tourists' price". The portions were also smaller than what you deserve for the price. Do a bit more research and head to any of our local food centres, you'll get more variety at a "local price"
5
This is a collection of food stalls right on the bay in Singapore. Every kind of Malaysian food imaginable. Outdoor location. Beer $10 a pint. If this sounds expensive to first time visitors believe me it is a bargain in Singapore. We have been twice on separate trips and it is well worth doing
3
The food was ok, wasn't great. It is pricey and not as good as what you would expect. That said, I believe it's catered more towards the tourists who stay in the nearby hotels.We had typical Singaporean dishes. Sambal stingray, sambal sotong (calamari), chicken and mutton satay, chicken wings and oyster omelettes. Stingray was rather dry, calamari felt overlooked. Sambal was nice though. Chicken wings were good. Oysters were ok. Sarah's were alright. The selling point is the view of MBS and the bay. That's if you're lucky enough to get a seat on that side. Overall, somewhat disappointing
4
Looks posh here! But also has the feel of a night food market with lots of stalls. It looks right over to marina bay sands so it's in a good location as you're right by The water. Gets very busy so hard to find a table but worth the wait, there's lots of variety! Lots of different cuisines available. It was good food - good portions and not too expensive especially for Singapore
4
We visited Gluttons Bays on a food tour and enjoyed a beautiful tasting plate which included sambal stingray and chicken rice balls. The atmosphere was full of energy and was a buzz with people looking for, eating and enjoying the wide range of local cuisine that was on offer. It was good value and I would have like to spend more time there, it is on my list of places to revisit next trip to Singapore
4
This is a hawker with the best view in all Singapore. It is said that all the stalls are Singapore's best street food. I find the food is not that spectacular. But as the atmosphere is great, we still come here if we visit Singapore and in Esplanade area just before dinner time. Just need patience as in dinner rush time usually there's queue in all stall
4
The food and selection here was great. Value for money very good as well. The only drawback was that it was VERY busy, a testament to how good it is, but can make finding a table challenging. With that said, don't be afraid to ask about sharing a table, we did, and possibly enjoyed our experience more as a result
4
First time there for dinner, a good spread of local we'll know. hawker food. Mee Goreng, Mee Soto and satay was nice.
4
Good food. Good ambiance. Lots of people. Getting a table is quite difficult especially during dinner time. But, the food is really delish plus there's a Filipino stall too.
3
The mee goreng is very disappointing. It's very oily and the stall owner refuses to give calamanci to go with the mee goreng. Avoid it at all costs!
On the other hand, the carrot cake was yum from Huat Huat stall!
4
Highly recommend a visit to this hawker/food van strip. There's a large variety of food - including delicious BBQ Sambal stingray, chilli crab as well as many of the Singapore staple items to tick off your "what to eat in Singapore" list!Plentiful beer and tables with a nice view down the marina end of the strip are worth visiting for dinner. The food was cooked fresh, you can find a table while waiting for your "buzzer" to go off
5
Two colleagues of mine introduced me to this Hawker Centre (Public Food Court) in Singapore back in May 2014.It was an amazing experience. You will not find a better assortment and variety of freshly prepared Asia-Pacific dishes at an affordable price.Plus, the relaxed outdoor atmosphere is perfect for a nice meal with friends any day of the week
3
It was very busy in the evening when we went. It took a few minutes to find a table which we ended up clearing and wiping our selves.It was my first experience of a hawker centre and I loved it. Good choice of food all freshly prepared. Definitely worth a trip. You are best to take some wet wipes with you!
4
This is a good find. There a wide spread of food selection here though it can be too crowded over the weekends as it is in close proximity to the tourist attractions (from Merlion Park, Esplanade, The Float, Helix Bridge, to The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands) Getting a table is quite difficult, so better come in a bit earlier than the usual dinner time.
4
I love their satay! lot's of choices :) and when you order , they give you a small something that will lit up when your order is ready, so no need to stand and wait infront of their stall,,, we had difficulty finding a seat though,, there are too many people..... and no flies at all.. lo
3
We had to walk a distance from the MRT Station and got a little lost looking for this place. Fortunately we were early because it became very crowded within minutes of arriving there. We ordered the Hokkien noodles and Oyster Omelette. The dishes were okay but not outstanding. We will probably not be back
4
We went on a Saturday and despite the crowd, the food was reasonably good. We ordered sting ray and fried rice. Both were okie. Sting ray was a bit overpriced. Also ordered chicken wings. It is a touristy spot, so expect prices to be to higher and portion smaller.
4
With only 5SGD you could eat a Nasi with Steamed Rice. And with only 1.8SGD you could drink cold lime!. Halal food sign are clear, staff was so cooperative, and your main point is Marina Bay and Merlion Park view. Worth every SGD!.
3
You could really get the local hawker food here but the place is to messy these days. lots of people cannot even move properly. May be its because of the weekend.
5
My partner and I come here often when we visit Singapore. It has a good spread of food and an amazing view of Marina Bay. It is also very affordable.
3
Yes it was noisy, yes it was cheap, yes it was messy, but it's great fun and in a very convenient location on the esplanade. The food is fine, and it's very inexpensive. There's plenty of variety and the atmosphere was good when we were there. I'm told there are better places, but this was good enough to soak up some hawker food establishment atmosphere
2
I recommend all tourist to head out and reach out to REAL hawker centres for a more legitimate Local experience. Tasteless food, food is too expensive. Even the drinks are expensive. It doesnt tally with the quality of what I consumed. I get better quality hawker food at an even lower price anywhere else
3
I went for dinner with some friends and we found the place really crowded and with very limited available space. The food quality is normal and it is not as cheap as other places that are around (i.e: Telok ayer market). Only good thing are the views, if you can grab a good table
4
Staying in Marina Bay Sands, Mandarn Oriental or other great hotels nearby then you should do a lunch or dinner here. Kind of an elevated street food environment close to your hotel. Not bad value in Singapore.... still hard to pay more for a beer than your main course
4
This area has to rate as one of Singapore's best hawker centre’s and with attractive views to boot.Glutton Bay is located right along the Harbour front and provides good views over both, Marina Bay and Merlion Park.We chose to dine here because of it’s close proximity to all the attractions within the Gardens of the Bay.Of course there is a huge range of cuisine and drink styles available.We chose a variety of food including the Oyster omelette, char grilled Prawns and Beef and Chicken Satay skewers.Whatever you choose to eat or drink, you cannot go wrong here with flavour, taste, price and views
5
Wow - so glad that we stumbled upon this wonderful place on our first night in Singapore. Great variety of food and a great way to sample the local food. Good value for money. Just wish that I could have been able to purchase a glass of wine to go with it, however my husband enjoyed the local beer with his meal every night
4
Just a short walk round from Marina Bay Sands next to the F1 grandstand, was directed to Gluttons by a friend. There are various different which serve different specialities, we had some noodles with shrimp and loads of satay sticks which were delicious.It's reasonable enough, certainly cheaper than eating in a r Stuart ant and like other Hawker places, you order your drink at a different stall.We went at 10pm at night and it was winding down and it gets very busy at lunch, dinner and weekends but well worth a visit.
5
Great food selection, great variety and just awesome food! So much to choose from except there's competition on tables. One has to look out for tables while the others order food.
4
It was a nice place that covers a lot of different cuisines that you can choose from. It's a great choice for groups who have varying tastes. Most of the restaurants are affordable, have big servings and very delicious.
5
the f00d is g00d i tried charkweich0w, f00d servings is g00d f0r 2per0ns,, and seaf00ds are very delici0us,,, u need t0 put tissue 0n ur table it means its reserve, They are many f00d ch0ices available is Makansutra,,

So it is your first time to visit Singapore, maybe on a business trip, maybe as a tourist. You are staying in what I call the hotel row - Stamford, Marina Square, Suntec area. You are raring to experience the famous Singapore food but you don't know where to go. Well, fret no more. Near your hotel is the Makansutra Glutton"s Bay - a street food place located beside the Esplanade. The different food stalls were carefully curated by Mr. Makansutra (KF Seetoh), a famous celebrity local cuisine chef and food critic. Be adventurous - try the different local delights. Beer is a little bit on the expensive side (S$6 per mug) but alcohol is expensive in Singapore anyway. But all of those street food selection go very well with Tiger Beer.After dinner, burn those calories. Take a walk along the Esplanade where you can contemplate the Singapore skyline. Then walk back to your hotel. Singapore is quite safe so no need to worry about being mugged. :)Tips: wear light cotton shirts and shorts and comfortable walking shoes. Singapore is quite humid. And bring your pack of paper table napkins (grab some from the hotel). For some unexplainable reason, it is not a common practice for Singapore restaurants and foodie places to provide paper napkins to customers. And in Singapore, while TIPPING IS NOT PRACTICED, please you may want to give some tip to the Tiger Beer lady who brings you your cold mugs of beer. They get paid on the quantity of beer they sell
5
We ate here on a busy Saturday night. Managed to share a table with some friendly Singapore locals, who recommended certain stalls to purchase from. We could have kept eating all night, sharing plates of food between 3, so we got to taste loads of different dishes. Chicken Rice, Pork belly, fried rice, Green Curry, Satay Sticks (BEST satay sauce I had in Singers!) We found the prices excellent, and the atmosphere was awesome. Great views of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel across the water
5
You can comfortably eat a meal for two for S$20 here. All hawker centres are regulated by the authorities so you can expect very high standards. With all that competition next to each other stall holders cannot be complacent about quality. Most of them will cook the meal to order depending on what you have. Yes this particular one is full of tourists but it is right in the heart of the bay area, which locals live here ? That does not distract from the fact that if you want a good food at a cheap price, come here
5
Love this place; and make a point of visiting each time we're in Singapore. This time we settled for a large serve of mixed satay, washed down by cold Tiger beer. Relative to prices charged in many restaurants in Singapore, this hawker food represents great value. And with the location so perfectly placed on the bay, it's easy to make the meal a part of a pleasant evening walk as the Singapore night begins
5
This is an open air food court off Raffles Avenue not far from the Marina Bay Sands and the Gardens by the Bay. Lots of great stalls with plenty of choice at very reasonable prices. Hard to find a seat at 7pm on a Sunday but worth the effort. Not fine dining but good local food
1
Decided to drop by for dinner after a pleasant walk along esplanade. Ordered a plate of Hokkien Fried Noodle and a plate of Oyster Omelette. The noodle was bland with as not enough time was given for it to absorb the prawn soup stock. The Oyster Omelette was equally bad as it was very starchy with little trace of eggs.Thank goodness we ordered a plate of BBQ Chicken Wings. The chili sauce was extremely spicy and the lime juice was zesty enough to compliment the wings.Overall, can skip this place and walk a little further to visit the nearby aircon food court within Marina Square

This place is just located a short walk away from the Esplanade and is just across the road from Marina Square. You can order local favourites such as satay, roti prata, Chinese "zi char", Hokkien prawn noodles, barbecued chicken wings, carrot cake, Hainanese chicken rice and even Filipino food. Of course the usual drink and desert stalls are present. We enjoyed the pork knuckles, Hokkien mee, fish hor fun (or sum lo hor fun), satay, prawn paste chicken, barbecue sting ray and barbecue chicken wings, but were let down by the ice kachang (sweetened ice shavings). While it's supposed to comprised of famous eateries, we felt those original ones taste much better (eg Wee Nan Kee). Prices are higher than the typical food court and the place appears targeted at tourists rather than locals. Nevertheless, it's conveniently located for anyone to sample a variety of food available in Singapore. A point to note though - the parking charges at the carpark next to Glutton's Bay is pricy and you are better off parking in Marina Square.
2
I doubt any locals would eat here. If they did, it would be for the view and not the food. Better off eating in nearby food courts; better choices and tastier. We left our hokkien mee and oyster omelette half eaten; ordinary boring flavours.
5
This hawkers food market is in a brilliant location adjacent to Marina Bay Promenade and the food was excellent, good quality and very good pricing. Ideal to eat here and watch the light show in the marina and just enjoy the street life.
4
The best time will be in the fine evening for the dinner. Variety of choices in food. The price will be a bit higher than normal rate. The atmosphere is really enjoyable.
4
Ordered several food choices including chilli crab with the friend buns, friend noodles from Hokkien?, carrot cake (interesting dish). Carrot cake does not have carrots! All in all, was affordable and gave a taste of Singapore.
4
This is for Filipino foodies in Singapore! They offer here chili-crabs and other different cuisines at reasonable price. Sellers here even speak tagalog because majority of the customers are Filipinos!
We'll definitely try this place again when I return to Singapore. :)
5
This was a great hawker centre for selecting dishes to make a whole meal and with vegetarian and excellent fish dishes, battered pieces were so crispy, sauce flavours rich and rice refreshing and complimentary. There are good drink and desert stalls as well. Great location and clean environment
1
Food was OK, flavoursome enough and a decent portion. The drink vendor tried to charge me $63 for a mug of Tiger; I couldn't quite tell if he was just joking around or whether he really thought he could get me to pay that. It took a couple of goes for me to get him to charge the correct price ($5.90, clearly displayed on the list right in front of me). Watch out solo women.
5
We went to this hawkers food outlet one night and i can safely say it was one of the best places to eat that is close to city, there was a great atmosphere, the choices were great and the food exceptional, oh and i forgot to mention, it was very reasonably priced, i would highly recommend eating at Gluttons when visiting Singapor
5
It's a very nice place to go with friends as everyone can pick the kind of food they want from the choices available. The chicken rice is good. Totally recommend the BBQ stingray. Hokkien mee and black Carrot cake is good. As well as the Char Kway Tiaw
5
We walked past this place on the first night of our trip and mentioned that we'd like to go and eat there one night, we had a selection of dishes including crispy BBQ squid, oven roasted duck pancakes, duck rice and Thai mango sticky rice. All of the dishes were delicious and there was so many different dishes to choose from. It was incredibly clean and full of locals - that's always a good sign. Definitely worth a visit, no need to dress up though!
4
I've been eating here for the past days that I'm in Singapore and I couldn't agree more with the positive reviews about this place. I like the variety of food and the ambience. I will recommend this friends.
4
Open-air food court type. Walking distance from the Esplanade. We had chili crab and fried sting ray with sambal together with fried rice and stir-fried water spinach (kangkong). Delicious and just enough spice. Budget to mid-range prices. Lots of people dining here at night.
5
There are only about a dozen stalls but my goodness what wonderful cheap food. We went 2 twice whilst in Singapore, the 2nd time was best when I had Chilli Crab, have never tasted anything so good.
4
It's so busy after 6pm so can be difficult to find a table but the food is delicious and good value. Glutton Bay is a lovely place to sit after dinner and enjoy the view or just people watch. We were only in Singapore for a short transit stop but it was worth the taxi ride to come here for a meal. Our taxi driver said this hawker market was mainly frequented by locals which is what we were after. Good variety of stalls here although it's only a small market
5
I like this place! It is an open hawker style food court but with modern style.It has various type of foods such as satay, cereal prawn, chili crab, mee goreng and salted egg chicken (these are my recommendations) from the 15+ stalls.The place is clean and well organised. The tables and seats are well maintained too. It is located at the Esplanade Theater (the famous "durian building"). You can reach here by walking through the Esplanade tunnel toward the Theater from the Esplanade MRT or City Hall MRT (via Esplanade Link).The view of the Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore's Merlion are great here. Note that the area is also popular place for family walking, jogging and live performance
4
This is the place to go if you want to try hawker food in Singapore. You can eat all the hawker food you want here from the row of stalls that specialize on different types of hawker food. Make sure you get here early, though. It can be difficult to get a table especially as it gets late into the night.
4
This food court serves variety of Asian cuisine. The price is reasonable. However this place can get so crowded as it is located near the Marina bay. It is very busy during dinner so needs to come a bit earlier to find a place to sit quickly. Then after or before dining you can walk around and enjoy the city view.
4
Top place for hawker street food. Can be difficult to find a seat. Has a wide variety of food - I tried the kway teow, satay and black carrot cake. All of it was fantastic and very filling. Prices are very reasonable and the view is lovely. It is walkable from City Hall and Raffles Place. Bring small cash change. Also bring your own napkins
5
Found this place by the off chance when walking back from the Singapore flyer. It has a great atmosphere and views of Singapore and gets rather busy but the variety of food is just awesome. I was able to substitute certain things on the menu for vegetarian options.
5
This centre by the side of the Esplanade theatres is wonderful.You can eat from all across the region with delicacies such as oyster omelette and black carrot cake as well as the signature Chili Crab. Food is quick and superb tasting.Went with a work colleague who, who brings all his European and Australian visitors here. He said it is the tourist's choice ; not quite typical of other hawker centres.Does get very busy; we were there about 6:30 pm and by the time we left, people were having to queue for tables. It is worth getting there early and then going on to watch the light show at 8:00 from Marina Sands
4
This is an open air food market with variety delicious food and also very nice view of Marina Bay. Still in reasonable price though.
3
As much as the prices are not cheap, it is still one of the cheapest alternatives in this area. It offers great variety of foods and therefore is a good place to eat in Marina area.
5
We had chili shrimps, chili crabs, crab fried rice and kare kare for dinner. The place is quite busy, we arrived there at 8pm, We enjoyed the food, especially the chili crabs, so delicious. The stunning view of Marina Bay at night was great. I love the ambience, a great place to have dinner. A must see for tourist visiting singapore
5
Well worth a visit... the food is good, good variety and tasty. A good representation of the favourite hawker fare that locals love. Prices are pretty decent, portions are large. Do drop by at night, it's much cooler and the ambience much better. Try sitting away from the stalls, it's much cooler
4
Very nice night market with tonnes of people and vibrancy. I opted for a night time helping of Kaya toast from 'Sweet stop' because there is never not a good time for some Kaya. I washed this down with a fresh cocounut with juice - awesome
5
You might have to wait for a seat, but that's because Makansutra is always packed after sundown. With beautiful views, it's definitely the place to be.Recommended foods include a crunchy and sweet honey squid, a grilled stingray that is appropriately spiced, and wonderfully grilled chicken and beef satay. Definitely worth a visit
5
I take all my overseas visitors to Makansutra Glutton's Bay, and feedback to date has been "WOW". I myself enjoy going there. Nice and chilled out place to have a nice local meal complemented with tiger beer. Nice location as well, walking distance to Marina Bay Sands. The crabs can be expensive but in the overall scheme of things, taking the atmosphere of the place into account, it is worthwhil
4
Just walking by Theaters on the Bay recently and we chanced upon Makansutra Glutton's Bay. This food court provides visitors with a variety of local street food plus a couple of foreign cuisines. We ordered satay bbq with rice cake, chicken and noodles from one stall, plus roasted chicken wings, and white carrot cake from another stall. A small pitcher of cold draught beer completed this small feast (it was for 2 people). Good food and cold drinks on a hot humid night - this is perfect !Service though can be improved, as I felt much pressure to put in my order quickly without having ample time to enjoy my food selection. But those are nuances. Food and drinks were very much appreciated. A celebration of local food culture.(Oh, and by the way, don't even try looking for carrot in the carrot cake.
3
Its a bit pricey given its proximity to Marina Bay Sands (which confirms previous reviews). Nothing really to go gaga about...one large chili crab for example can cost about S$53 whole half of a roasted duck can go for S$36. Compare this to the price of a buffet dinner at the Rise in Marina Bay Sands which costs abot S$78. Which would you prefer
3
nice ambiance! river is a few steps away. a lot of food choices/stalls to choose from. what we had was oyster omelette (first time), shrimp cereal (first time too), chopsuey, hainanese chicken and pork satay. Though the Hainanese chicken isn't something I expected, the one restaurant we went to near the hospital was the best. Crab dishes are expensive though ranging about $30-40 dollars. Twas a gastronomical experience in Singapore rather than eating at expensive restaurants to stress that restaurants are usually not cheap anywhere in SG. After Makan, go have a night cap at the bars on the other side, walking through the linking bridge. But be aware though that those bars are very very expensive :
4
A fun, vibrant atmosphere and delicious food all within a short stroll from the Marina and all its nightlife offerings :)
5
tasty and reasonable price.
also Beer was cheaper than any other restaurant!
nice view for marina bay sands!
3
The food is of average quality and expensive for what it is. If there's time one would be better off going to marina square food courts to have their meal there as it'd be cheaper and air conditioned as well.
5
the collection of food stalls are located next to the Esplanade Mall. with a spectacular view of singapore harbour front, you can enjoy different nice food from nice singapore local restaurant including my favourite wee nam kee chicken. you must be able to choose your delicious dinner from satay, seafood, bbq chicken wings, traditional hainanese chicken rice
4
We stayed at a hotel near here so went one evening for dinner. The place was packed (it always is), and it is hard to get a table, but people are usually really happy to share table space. The food was very good. It isn't the best hawker food in Singapore, but it is in a great location right by the esplanade. We tried oyster omelet, char skew, and fried noodles- all great. Go to the place with the longest line and you won't be disappointed
5
One of the best locations to sample the culinary delights Singapore has to offer. Location is a plus on the Esplanade and open till 1am provides ample convenience. Not expensive either where we had a lot of food (including chilly crab and jug of beer) for $120.First come, first served in terms of seating, so you just need to be patient with finding a table for the size of your group. Rush hour between 6-8pm can be challenging
4
the food is superb.it looks good and yummy.there is a lot food stall choices with reasonable prices.some crew can say a little tagalog.there are many people patronizing the place.it was a nice experience for my family.it is near walked to merlion to take some photos after eating
4
went here with my family last July 14, 2016 after our river cruise. its a good food place to have lunch or dinner. though when we were there for dinner, the place was full and it was hard to get available table for our group (6 pax). must try here is the cereal shrimps which is absolutely fantastic and their chili crabs
3
Upon arriving in Singapore, met up with friends for dinner at makansutra to try their hawker fare, beer was good (tiger) tried the oyster omelet sg style, fried rice, pork liempo from Gerry's grill, Sisig with soy sauce and chili, Singapore fried noodles, banana tempura etc
4
My brother brought me to Makansutra Glutton's Bay for dinner for a change from the hotel food I've been eating for several days.Just like in the Philippines, one-stop food place of different food specialties from Singapore, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand among others. I think night time is best time to eat as it is an open area with monobloc tables and chairs. Price is affordable. What I can only remember among the food we ate is "Sate" hahaha :-D
5
street food entrance, several spots to choose from, drinks, food variety (Asian).
I should have spent much more time there.
2
Brought a couple of visitors to this place as they wanted the Hawker food feeling after a day of touring around....
Poor quality, higher price, limited options, crowded and not well maintained...
If you have other options for this kind of experience, suggest go elsewhere...
4
This place has a large number of outlets selling a variety of different food, such as satay, crab and other Asian dishes. The price is generally cheap. Location is between Singapore Flyer and Merlion.
3
We came for dinner before going to see Les Mis at the esplanade. We came at around 6 which was perfect, because by the time we left at 7 the place was jam packed. Tried the 'black carrot cake' which I was pleasantly surprised by. Also had the mixed stays, which were a bit dry. The banana fritters with pandan were yuuum! Cheap and tasty food- my advice- go early and share a couple of plate
2
Orh luak (oyster omelette with starch) was authentic and oysters were fresh. 8.5/10.Satay was sedap. 8/10.Crispy cereal duck fried rice - lots of cereal and rice. But where was the duck? 4/10.Sugar cane with lemon - could not taste the sugar cane nor the lemon. More like ice water. 0/10
4
After our tiring day at USS and Sentosa, we headed here to have a dinner.Right before we have completed our ordered meals, rain poured out and the staffs from different food stalls helped all their customers get inside the tent.Food was awesome because unlike other hawkers - for a tourist like me - they serve good food. Chili crab with tiny buns are the best
4
If you bored by all the fancy and over dressed places in the marina Bay area try this outdoor food court. Great selection of all cuisine styles. Pricing seemed to be fair regarding the area. Staff was mostly friendly. Food we had was good.. My recommendation. Try the satay sticks or Indian rice dishes.
4
The quality of food is excellent. Variety is good. There were 3 of us, we were craving for different things and we all got what we wanted. All of us agreed that the food are delicious. The location is accessible and the view is Marina Bay - beautiful and modern. I will definitely go back here when in SG.
5
This open air eating place opens until late at night, offering Southeast Asian hawker food and drink from several vendors. It commanded a view to the Marina Bay Sands, which looked especially majestic at night, and since it's by the sea, the air was fresh. It was great to have a dinner with friends under the stairs with soft winds blowing on our face. And the food was nice too! We bought Thai food and Singaporean seafood, washed down with drinks like iced kopi tarik and iced teh tarik. After dinner, we took a relaxed walk to the Merlion, which was close by
3
Monoblock dining tables are set-up and you will buy your choice of food from the food stalls offering wide range of cuisines. Price is good, food is good. Location and view is good where after satisfying your appetite you can sit and have a chat with your friends/family nearby and fill your heart and eyes with the beauty of the skyline, Marina Bay, Merlion Park, Esplanade, etc. Enjoy! :-
4
Food was good with lots of choice served in an open air alley. Tables cleaned by very efficient staff after every sitting so nice and clean. Youth music festival at the waters edge when we visited, very cool live music.
5
Best and Freshest Singapore Chilli Crab Curry In Singapore:)
Also enjoyed the seafood egg fried rice immensely with fresh seafood in it.
3
A number of different local hawker food was available there, chicken rice, BBQ seafood, satay, prawn noodle etc. Food was not that cheap. It is just a convenient spot to recharge your stomach after strolling around the waterfront promenade & bayfront areas.
2
This food court serves below average overpriced food from the chicken rice to thai curry, clearly targeted towards hungry tourists who wouldn't know where to eat in and around Esplanade.
4
I've been told that Singapore is famous for street food markets such as this one. Although a bit small, I wasn't disappointed. They had a fairly good selection of food. The real plus was their operating hours. We went to the Night Safari this evening and didn't have enough time to get dinner. We were able to get an 11pm dinner afterwards. Quite a lot cheaper than the restaurants in the nearby malls
3
If you want to get a table with the river view, you must either go there early or be prepared to wait for a table to be vacated.Food: I liked Gerry's Grill's grilled squid and bulalo; satay is just ok; the grilled chicken wings are good; and then our regular favorites which are the seafood fried rice and crispy cereal prawn. This time, however, the crispy cereal prawn skin are a bit too thick for my liking. The stall which sells the steamed cockles is gone (or maybe it's still there but it just so happens that do not sell steamed cockles anymore)
3
Very crowded place for sure! You may have to share table with other guests so don't expect much of a privacy place. The foods are average, price is a little bit higher than other Hawker food centre and you can find better quality foods in Singapore!
3
This place was crowded when I came at 6 pm, so my family decided to had a dinner here. We bought satay, oyster omelette, Thai Fried Rice, and Ice Durian. The food wasn't delicious enough for me, just so so.And the place is overcrowded, so you must came here (maybe) around 5 pm
2
I've eaten here twice in the last year, and can hardly think of a less welcoming introduction to the "hawker food" culture of Singapore. Tucked away alongside the Esplanade concert hall and opposite Marina Square, this strip of hawker-styled eats offers a choice of local fast food. The upsides are an accessible location, relatively clean surroundings, presentable store fronts, a variety of food choices and an impressive bay-front view and location. Downsides are crowded tables, long queues (though these move relatively fast), higher prices, lack-lustre food, and sometimes, indifference bordering on rudeness from the proprietors. The entire experience is unedifying and a triumph of marketing over substance. I only ever eat here when attending a concert at Esplanade and need quick sustenance with little time to spare. Seriously - if you're in Singapore for a taste of food, give this place a miss
4
We didn't arrive at our hotel until 21.30 and by the time we got to the lobby all the eating places were closed at 10pm . We went for a wander and were pointed in the direction of Gluttons Bay , it was just what we needed . My husband had some satay and I went for the Indian but they had run out of vegetarian mural aka so I had noodles instead , mine noodles weren't great but my husband enjoyed his satay . I then saw banana tempura , yum ! It was served with a sauce that had coconut in it and was very nice . It was just what we needed at that time . It wasn't over busy as nearly 11pm by then . Great if you want a late meal 
4
It was a lovely evening and the place has a lively atmosphere. Experience local types of food at affordable prices. I think it also has some of the cheapest beer in town.
5
This place is open until 2am! Great place to go on a long layover, located on the Esplanade, with a view of the Marina Bay. Service is phenomenal and great tasting food!
3
Food is definitely over priced. Overrated. You can find better food other places. Not recommended unless no other choice.
5
Great outdoor venue overlooking the marina. Hugely popular with locals and tourists. Had street food such as chicken satay and nasi padang, lovely flavours, authentic, fresh food for a great price.
3
Much smaller food market than others we experienced on our trip to Singapore, leading to a smaller food selection. The food we ordered was pretty decent, though it wouldn't have been our first choice at a larger market.
5
This is one of my favorite place in Singapore! Because I love food and I love to eat! This place is great for food adventure because you will try see and try all the local food in Singapore. And I must say that they really tastes good, some are spicy but it is ok with me.
5
Great outdoor hawker centre, really convenient for dinner after the Gardens by the Bay light show. Seems to be open later than some of the other hawker centres near where we were staying. Good choice of food and everything we had was great, particularly the satay. Gets busy with locals as well as tourists, but both times we went we didn't have to wait more than 5-10mins for a seat. Would recommend
3
The place is very close to waterfront promenade and there were lots of food stalls offering different cuisine. Some we are not familiar of. On our searched for what to eat we came across a familiar name from home Gerry's grill. We were even so amused that the staff are Filipinos and they even have that "po" at "opo" when they were speaking to us. The only problem we encountered at that time was finding a table since almost all were taken and occupied. Due to a number of customers dining and queing up to get their food the place is loud that we need to talk closer with each other to hear what the other is saying. Nevertheless it was fun to see people of different nationalities converge in this food strip
5
With so many cuisines on offer, we came back here a number of times during our stay in Singapore, just to try as much as we could! I appreciate other comments that say it gets very busy, but we never had a problem finding a seat. And other tourists are happy to share tables! The locals are very friendly; I saw one guy eating something that looked amazing, and I just asked him where he got it from, and he showed me to the stall (it was hokkien, by the way - try it, honestly it's brilliant). This is in a great location on the Bay too, great opportunity for a walk after you've stuffed yourself, or just sit and enjoy a drink. There's a taxi rank nearby too, so you can easily go anywhere afterwards
4
I reached this place while taking a evening stroll across marina Bay Area. Was thinking of having local food and this place looked just perfect for my taste buds. If you are a tourist and wants to have taste of local Singaporean food, then Makansutra is the place for you. Really great food, mouthwatering see food preparations at a very affordable cost. You can look around across the multiple shops, selected your food, they will do some tweaks and changes/ additions in your dish if you ask them nicely. All an all great place for foodies. If you are not into see food/nonveg then may be you will not enjoy it that much. But for rest it's worth going once
5
Get there early it can be really busy. Food is fresh, packed with flavour and cheap. Big selection of stalls. Chili crab was awesome!
4
My husband and I ate here while in Singapore. Great location on the Bay and found food and service really good.Gets busy later on in evening.
2
We ate dinner here a few weeks ago, while on holiday. The place is very crowded and we waited for a table (a common theme for many people throughout the night).We had satay, grilled prawns, grilled sting ray fillet and noodles. The quality of the food was poor
2
We arrived at approximately 7 p.m. and although most of the tables close to the river were taken, we had no trouble finding one at the road end.We ordered a chicken rice (steamed) and a chicken rice (roast) from Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice. The quality was poor. The rice was passable although it was only luke warm, however the chicken was stone cold as if it had just been taken out of the fridge! It was very unpleasant.After this disappointment we decided to get some satay to cheer ourselves up and this, from Alhambra Padang Satay, was, unfortunately, just mediocre as well. We had much better from Satay By The Bay a couple of days before.I'll be giving this hawker centre a miss on my next visit to Singapore
4
Having arrived late in the city and wanting to avoid the usual hotel room service. I asked the front desk to recommend a local eating spot. The young lady who I cannot recall her name pointed me in the direction that she thought I would enjoy. Came across this establishment which is a collection of late food vendors. They display what you get to eat and you go from there. I must say that it was tasty, quick and local. The location is by the marina and water. The next morning I ran by this place just to see what it looked like in the daylight. If you want to sample head to out to this place. They were still serving meals at 22:15 Good luc
2
Makansutra Glutton Bay is a very nice area with a very nice view of the Marina Bay.We walked around and decided to get a drink, that was nice and a good price.Then we decided to get some satays as we had enjoyed then at a place in Gardens By The Bay 2 days earlier.Alhambra Padang Satay was the stall we chose to get the satays from.The lady taking the orders was friendly and took our order and said it would be 5 minutes.We didn't go anywhere we just moved back and waited.Straight away a plate was brought out by the cook and put next to her.This was a larger order so I knew it wasn't ours.Immediately the flies started to land on the food and then a Indian family walked up and started to pick them up and then put the food back on the plate.I thought it may be for them but they left and two young girls came and collected the food a minute later.We made sure we waited and grabbed our food before the flies did.The satay sticks we had ordered was Mutton, Beef and Chicken.All 3 tasted the same and were all dried up but raw on the inside.The food was no where near as nice as what we have had at the other places.Look thru my photos and you will find pictures of yummy Satays but not from here.This is a shame as some of the other stalls may have nice food
3
We tried to eat here during our visit to Singapore unfortunately we chose Saturday night just after dusk and there was not a seat to be had which is probably as good a review as you can get. The smells were amazing. We just had to go into one of the chain restaurants nearby which was disappointin
4
MAKANSUTRA Is situated on the board walk mar the floating soccor field opposite the marina bay hotel, look for outdoor tables between the Irish pub and the soccor field, can't miss it. Food is sold from each stall just look a the pictures above the stalls and they will give you a number and cook me is usually about 5 minutes at most. GOOD TIP try to get most food from the same stall because the food you get dies he cold if you have various stalls to get food from. Satay sticks are very good various noodle dishes. Along with Macwells hawker food court his is one of the best we have found over years visiting Singapore
5
Absolutely love this place! Staying at the Mandarin Oriental this was so handy for us. Here you will find top quality street food, everybody's dishes look amazing as you walk through, so much so that it's hard to pick which stall to go to. It's a very busy place with a great buzz/atmosphere. You might have to wait for a table but it's worth it. We liked the Thai stall, try the cashew chicken.We were in Singapore for 2 nights and intended to have a posh expensive meal on the second night...however....we ate here the second night too as it was just so good! Yum
4
Just landed today and so late yet this place was still so busy 10.30 in the evening. The food is amazing and cheap and the rice is given in a massive portion and with full off flavour. Besides rice, there are plenty of dishes to try , seafood, meat and not a lot for vegetarians. Before you order from one of the stalls I suggest you find a table and grab it first especially if you are family or large group!
5
Good place prices are consistent.. food is nice and it is very near most of the attractions in singapore
4
This place has plenty of varieties of local food options. Cheap by Singapore standards and in a great location. Open air. Bring your nepkins.
5
Popular with tourists and locals alike. Get away from the restaurants and head here for good food with a great buzz. You won't be disappointed. Have the chilli crab and satays.
4
Enjoyed the ambience, local food, desserts. Plenty of varieties of local food options. This area is always bubbling with tourists. At peak hours you need to grab a seat first and then order your food. Overall a great experience for first time tourists.
5
Our second visit to these hawkers markets and again we were impressed. A little more expensive than maxwell centre but the location makes up for it. There is a great variety of food from satay's to grilled squid and tiger beer ladies who do table service. Definitely worth a visit for local foo
4
Despite that for hawkers its a bit pricey. I find that the location is superb, the quality and quantity of the food as well. And the place is clean. There's ample variety to choose from (though after trying most of them I always return to the same stall!) and plenty vegetarian too! Sometimes is hard to find a place to seat, in which case I ask for take away and head to the shore and have my meal by the bay. Can't beat those views.In my opinion, a must try, at least once.
4
We ate here after I read some pretty good reviews and as we were staying nearby at the Marina Bay Sands - it's only about a 5 minute walk once you're outside the hotel. I really wanted to try the black chilli or black pepper crab that I had seen advertised everywhere around Singapore. We got the black pepper crab, morning glory and fried rice from one of the stalls, can't remember which one exactly but it came to about NZD$60 which is a lot of $ to spend on hawker food but the crab obviously made up most of this price. The crab was exceptional! We only shared one crab between us but it was enough with our other dishes and the flavours were amazing. I was a bit disappointed when my husband brought back the black pepper instead of black chilli but was happy by the end of it, so yum! We also had a couple of tiger beers which were nice and cold and served in proper glasses and not too expensive like alcohol is in Singapore! This place is a bit touristy and more expensive than others of its kind but it was very convenient for us, had some really good food and the atmosphere and views from there are good. I would go again.
3
Ordered prawn/beef/chicken satay which at $29 were a little pricey. The $10 mixed veg fried rice from the adjoining stand consisted only of a couple of spring onions and a few shavings of green cabbage. Food tasted okay and seemed cooked to order - Not somewhere I would return though.
4
Food is mostly good, but the prices are definitely much more expensive than your normal hawker fare. For tourists, if you are able to travel to the heartlands and eat at the famed stalls during the off-peak hours (since you do not need to work), I would highly suggest you do that, instead of going here, which is sorta a tourist trap (price wise).I would recommend the roti prata stall, satay, the usual Singaporean fare. Don't take things like the tomyum soup, it isn't worth it - you are not in Thailand.Note that there is no aircon, and with the humid Singapore weather, be prepared to be sticky while you enjoy your sumptuous meal.Place is relatively conveniently located, since it is just by the Esplanade, and you could just continue walking down to Helix Bridge and then Marina Bay Sands. Much better if you do it at night though, hopefully with a nice little breeze from the river

This is a lovely spot to grab a variety of cheap hawker type food (cheap by Singapore standards, $8-12 for most main dishes) but remember to bring your own napkins! I forgot you needed to do this in Singapore and struggled with eating some messy Crawfish without - it was an experience but not one I'd recommend!
3
This area was jumping when we arrived around 5pm in a Sunday. The stalls were opening up for the night session and we tried a range of dishes. The view is modern and open but the food was better at Maxwell Hawker Centre and cheaper.
5
i've ordered the prawn cereal, sweet & spicy squid and lobster. really tasted heavenly! it was worth the price and i also love the ambience.
3
Open air food stalls offer great food, but here it is really expensive compared to other venues. Overall the tables appear somewhat greasy, and the father away from the waterfront you sit, the hotter and more humid it gets.
4
We'd been recommended to go to this Hawker Centre and it didn't disappoint. The food was excellent and a great atmosphere too. We were all able to choose from different stalls. Very enjoyable.
5
Near the esplanade waterfront the food stalls have a variety of choices. I'm a fan of the black pepper crab and it did not disappoint.
4
After few minutes of finding and securing your table, we've order a local food.
Malay and Indian food. I forgot what it's called. Good food! reasonable Price!
4
I love the open air food court concept with a view. Went there with my family for dinner. The ambience was nice. Not too crowded at that time and we decided foods from different stalls. The seafood that I ordered was okay. Good to go with family. Some people complained because it was too hot so maybe visit it for dinner just like we did. Was nice to see the lights and view too, relaxing good dinner time with family
3
The food is awesome! Cheap Chinese food around that area? Yes please. However, I have to keep in mind that this is a food court. Service is fast paced, you'd feel rushed even when you're trying to decide what to eat. And don't try their drinks! Just get water, anything else taste quite weird. Is it the place clean? Well, it's an outdoor food market. Not exactly known for cleanliness, but it's acceptable
5
Fantastic outdoor dining on local food(and variety of others). Ate at the Redhill Rong Guang BBQ seafood(first one when you arrive). Fried baby squid was really good and a unique dish. Service is good but as with all outdoor "street food" venues, getting a table is the biggest challenge but well worth it. Great view of Singapore and Marina Bay sands also...
5
This area did not disappoint... Beautiful chicken and beef satay, presented on a palm leaf with small pieces of sticky rice. We had a platter of 20 satay pieces for about 16 SGD, beer on draft also very well priced. Unfortunately they did not sell cider, if they are reading, maybe a Magners, Bulmers or Strongbow, just in a can would be ample and complete this selection of drinks for me and maybe other cider drinkers out there.Great atmosphere and food. Would definitely recommend this area, great location near to the waterfront and if you sit near the water you will have a view of the majestic Marina Bay Sands Hotel.This area is also within walking distance to the main shopping area, other restaurants and bars, 'Supertrees' and more
5
Go here, order Mie Goreng, prepare to have your mind blown by awesome taste. Prices are bit higher than in other hawker centers we visited, but it is really worth it.
5
This is the best place to try out local Singaporean dishes. There are so many food stalls to choice from and the dishes are reasonably price.
Best time to visit during dinner. The view is just everything (City lights + Marina Bay Sands)!!!
3
They have a variety of good food , specially the sea food and the famous Satay.
My only worry is that most of the times , the cutlery tends to be a bit dirty , I would say a bit on the unhealthier side .
5
Each time we visit Singapore we look forward to getting our Satay fix from Glutton's Bay. Excellent value for money. It's worth being happy to eat early so you can avoid the crowds and get a table.
2
Makansutra Glutton is a food centre located in Marina Bay, Singapore. It is usually crowded at night. There are quite a lot types of food there, hawker style.I went there on January 2016 after I took a ride at Singapore Flyer. Actually I have spotted this place the day before and thought because it was quite crowded so maybe the food will be great.But..Turn out the food sucks. I ordered Fried Kwetiao for me and Hokkian Mee for my boyfriend. I forgot which stalls I ordered from. The fried kwetiao tasted better than the hokkian mee even though both tasted bad :’They’re just plain, like you just mix the noodle and the ingredients with no salt, no sugar, no preservatives :’))But thankfully I also ordered some chicken wings. I saw there was quite a Q so the taste must be good (again) :D The chicken wing cost SGD 1.5 each. I bought three. Tasted okay if you compared to the kwetiao goreng and hokkian mee, but still not spectacular enough to make me want it more and more.Ah, but this place is quite cheap. So if you want to eat on budget maybe this is one place to consider, *if you don’t mind the taste tho :’D Have you visited this place? What do you think? Any good food here to make me want to visit again? :
4
Enjoyed this area to get some cheap eats then enjoyed the bay. They have some tables under umbrellas but most are out in the open. It had just rained but they had help to wipe down the seats. From there we enjoyed the night life and walking around the Waterfront, the Helix Bridge, free music, etc. Go for cheap eats then relax
5
Although this food market gets very busy it's definitely worth it. The views from the tables are lovely and the food is on the same level. The second stall from the marina 'Spicy King' doesn't have a massive choice of food, but that might just be because he's perfected the meals he sells. We had the crayfish and the chicken, delightful and services were excellent, hearty meals. Upon return the more complex take on 'cheesy chips' are absolutely to die for, we accompanied these with the 20pcs meat skewers from the stall second from the far end (I think). Absolutely lovely. Would recommend to anyone and choice is fantastic for only 12 stalls.
4
If you wanna try hawker food, here's a nice place! You can fins wide variety of food here. From nasi hainam, ba kut, to roti canai. You can also find seafood stall here. It opens until midnight. So if you stay around marina bay and hungry in the middle of the night, just go here
3
Me and my husband ordered chicken wings (@$1.5) and carrot cake ($5.5) from Huat Huat. They're just OK, nothing special. We also ordered sambal stingray ($12) from Red Hill Rong Guang, and request sambal served on the side. We found a lot of fish bone and we think it's tasteless. Great atmosphere and great view to marina bay sands
4
I like the place. We ate here twice during oue one week stay at singapore. We tried Sting Ray here. The stalls are good, tasty. I like the location, Marina bay sands is visble and if you are eating at around 8 pm or 9.30 pm the light show is also visible from here
5
I ate there twice during my short stay in Singapore due to the combination of the excellent location at Marina Bay and the price for the food. Under 10 Dollar I could eat there very well and I love the different dishes to select.
5
Whenever I dine here, there are lots of Filipino tourist eating.
Seems like this is a popular place to try local dishes in one seating plus the view of Marina Bay is great.
4
All kinds of Asian food for a good price. The tables are outside, some were under umbrellas, some were wet after rain, but the atmosphere is really nice.
3
Small hawker market with usual array of cheap and cheerful hawker food. Nice cheap option for eating out doors at Marina Bay, not too far from the Merlion.
5
This pseudo-hawkers market is a really great place to eat. The satay sticks are very tasty (highly recommended) and the place has a great vibe. It is busy and vibrant without being a hassle - everyone seems to be having a good time. The view to the marine bay sands and/or cityscape is nice. The place is spacious and feels like you are eating authentic food but that it is also very hygienic and safe. Only our laziness stopped us going back a second night (our hotel was not one of the many that are very close to this food market
5
meal is tasty, atmosphere is nice. the place is more like a food court, so there's a bunch of food store there. light is very bright till I hurt my eyes sometimes. :D very crowded at dinner time. careful for your belongings even though mostly Singapore is safe. you'll get wet when the rain comes
3
Here we find a lot of different variants of food and don't worry, for you are a Muslim, here are some halal food .. the location was not far from the MRT station, you can ride the MRT station exit at City Hall .. Makansutra located next to the Esplanade and on the other side Marina Square .
4
If you are not very particular and picky with food and on a budget, then I suggest you visit this place for authentic Singaporean food. This place offers wide range of Singaporean food. Not only that, some stalls offer malaysian, indian and chinese cuisine. Though food is not as presentable as their restaurant counterparts, food is clean and stalls are regularly checked by their food bureau
5
We stumbled upon Glutton's Bay on our walk home from the Gardens and ended up eating a three course street meal. The collection of food stalls serve everything from bbq'd pawns to satay to paratha and the location is right by the water. We were there on a Saturday evening and were able to get a table (however it did fill up as we ate and we ended up having a lovely couple from New York share our table). Prices are reasonable, especially when compared to the restaurants just down the walkway. Example: a can of beer is $5, a chicken satay platter is $9.
5
We attended on New Year's Day and it was fantastic! Our SIA Holiday Stop Over package included a sample entree per person and after a cost-effective Malay style dinner we then wandered to Marina Bay followed by Gardens By The Bay. Great location and on the route of the SIA Hop On Bus
5
We bring our overseas friends and relatives to taste a good selection of local street food like satay, bbq seafood, chicken rice and noodles. Against the backdrop of Singapore's city landscape
5
What a variety of food available here. This is one of my favourite places to have satay and sticky rice. It gets very busy but it's worth ordering and waiting for a table.
3
The place was so packed.Food was ok...Best tip is to go early in the evening for dinner before crowd starts coming in
5
This was a family favourite for dinner! Lots of choice, friendly people, value for money. Great range of food on offer with views looking onto Marina Bay Sands - Nice
5
I visited a friend in Singapore who took me here to try all the local foods - it was awesome! There is everything Singaporean for you to try with fusion between Chinese, Malay and Indian food!
5
Really good variety of food, great to have the opportunity to eat some Singaporean classics. Very good value, great atmosphere, food quickly and freshly prepared.
3
I went there with my husband as part of the SIA Stopover package. We received a sampler set each and we also ordered some extra food. Some of the sampler set items were good, but overall, the food was nothing to rave about.We went early as recommended by other reviewers, but I think that made the experience worse for us, because the place really lacked atmosphere. We felt like we just wanted to leave. Probably would've been a bit better after sunset so you can at least look out at the city lights
5
Chili crabs are cheaper here compared to other hawker places we went to like in Newton or the Food Trail (Flyer). It's a good alternative to No Signboard Seafood chilicrabSatay was excellent and also so Filipino food (Gerry's)After eating we just strolled around up to esplanade which was a good way of burning all the food consumed in Makansutr
5
Just over the road from the Mandarin Oriental is this gem - you sit outside with other like minded food enthusiasts and select from a range of Singaporean dishes - you get the Malaysian, Chinese and Indian influences. The food comes quickly, its cheap and you watch the stall holders cooking. They don't try and hassle you either. You can enjoy a Tiger beer and dessert as well. The atmosphere is fantastic - friendly relaxed and the food is good
4
Considering the location & crowd it attracts, prices are ok. But they are still far higher than other hawker centres with equally good or better food. Weekends evenings are extremely crowded. Still a nice place to take visitors while going to Merlion & Esplanade. Best tip is to go early in the evening for dinner before crowd starts coming in.
4
Thanks to KF Seetoh for this awesome place, never missed it when in town, never go wrong with the Chicken Wing, Carrot Cake and Chili Crab ;)
4
Really really Good chilli crab!!! Yum yum!!! We had dinner here 1 night while in Singapore, it's like an outdoor hawkers market. It's also good location for tourists being right on the bay. Get the crab and some beers and enjoy the night!
4
You can find different kind of foods here. Different from the other hawkers. The seafoods are nice. If you are not into seafood, local dishes are also available.
Overall food taste is okay.
4
Good introduction to Singapore street food. Can get lots of small plates from different stalls and enjoy trying different meals.
The Tiger beer is lots cheaper here than all the hotel/mall places just across the road.
2
Generally the standard of food at this outdoor hawker centre has deteriorated . When we were there recently, it was early evening and not crowded, so it was rather surprising that the oyster omelette, satay and chendol we ordered were sub-standard and overpriced. The satay especially were hard and many were impossible to eat as they were badly burnt. The chendol [green rice flour jelly] were hard and chewy. We enjoyed walking along the waterfront and listening to great live performances at the outdoor theatre but terribly disappointed with the service and food at this place
5
Loved eating here. We were visiting in January at Chinese New Year so it was packed but well worth the wait. Our expat friends brought us here for dinner so we knew it was going to be good as they are real foodies! Totally loved it and super cheap too
2
So very crowded. The trouble with a busy place like this, is that people waiting for a seat are always hovering/staring waiting for you to finish your meal. It just doesn't allow for a very relaxed atmosphere when you are aware that people are literally waiting to pounce the minute you make some small signal that you may be about to finish up. We had to wait about 20/25 minutes or so until two seats became free on any table. It would be a challenge to get seating for a family.The food we ordered was nothing special so I don't know what all the fuss is about. We had:chicken rice - $4.50 (this was the best dish IMO)lemon chicken - $10pineapple fried rice - (just awful) mixed satays $8can of Tiger beer $5We actually couldn't wait to finish and walk a few metres down towards the river for some peace and quiet.Personally, I won't be returning or recommending
4
Two of us managers from the same company were in Singapore for two days. Our local Director suggested we go to Glutton's Bay and try out the Food Court at Makansutra. We were glad we did. I always wanted to try the Chilli Crab in Singapore and what a feast it was. I'm told the owners of this Food Court went around Singapore choosing stalls with the best dish. So each stall sells only one item and the competition ensures they are always on top of their game. This place is always crowded -- so emulate the locals, who place a tissue pouch on the table to reserve their place, while they scout the vendors for their favourite dish
4
Street Food is so characteristic of South East Asia! While Singapore does not have much of literal "street" food like what you see in Thailand or Vietnam, the culture of cheap, yet tasty food courts are very popular. Makansutra offers you a melange of street food in the trendiest of places and is a great option if you are tourist looking to savour some cheap South East Asian food. The fact that it is just in the promenade area, near to some of the best attractions in Singapore makes it even more convenient. Note that the place is pretty crowded, so you might need to plan accordingly. And if you've feasted too much, do not worry - the MRT, Taxi Stand and Bus Stop are just a short walk away
5
Must-visit for cheap but good food! I love the Chicken Rice from Wee Nam Kee (not sure if the spelling is right). It's very delicious with a cheap rice, I even can't help myself from ordering extra rice :) Hehehe. The Carrot Cake and Chicken wings are also must-try! Also try the sugar can juice for your drinks! Before we left Singapore, I made sure that we ate here again on our last night. Will definitely eat again in this place when I visit SG
5
Delicious food
Great view of the Marina Bay Sands - perfect to enjoy the lazer show at 8.30 and 9.30pm while enjoying dinner
5
Enjoy hawker street food from curry crab, satay, grilled chicken in cheap price. Sitting outdoor at evening and enjoy a nice view of Fullerton and Marina Bay Sands.
4
This is not a large hawker centre, but has a good variety of cuisines... almost like a introduction to Singapore street foods. Worth stopping by if you are staying in the area or visiting the Esplanade or Marina area,
3
Food is good, location is great, but I think I can find the same food for a cheaper price somewhere else. We were so hungry we forgot to haggle :p People flock here so be ready to share seats.
MRT Esplanade
4
Fun outdoor experience! You just have to bring a lot of patience waiting for available tables and queueing for your food. The Salted Egg Pork Ribs is a must try! Weird but it works.
5
My wife and I fancied a late dinner on Thursday 5th November 2015, after visiting the Gardens by the Bay. We went to the Esplanade and found our way to Makansutra Glutton’s Bay where we had dined in 2008 on a previous visit to Singapore. After pacing up and down and seeing what was on offer, we settled on the Alhambra Padang Satay stall. We ordered some sticks of chicken satay, since Alhambra are reputed for their satay. We also ordered a bowl of mee rebus, a plate of tahu goreng and a bowl of mee soto.The chicken satay was splendid as expected - tender, well marinated and grilled just right. The peanut dipping sauce was perfect in spiciness, taste and texture. The satay came with the obligatory ketupat (rice cake), cucumber and onions.The mee rebus was reminiscent the traditional kampong dish and enhanced with a squeeze of lime. The mee soto with the addition of chilli in soy sauce gave it the right sharp flavour. The tahu goreng was fried tofu served with cucumber, bean sprouts, kangkung and other ingredients in a sweet tangy peanut and soy-based sauce. All these dishes were very delicious and appetising. We very much wanted to savour these traditional Malay specialities on our trip to Singapore and we were more than satisfied with the fare from Alhambra Padang Satay and their service
5
I would say that this is one of my favorite places to eat whenever I'm in Singapore. This is where you can get a nice chili crab for a fraction of the price in a normal restaurant. The place is usually packed with people, both tourists and locals, so be prepared to wait patiently for available tables
5
This place is so busy and the food is fresh and hot.Massive variety of choices from lots of set up food vendors.So much cheaper than eating in some flashy restaurant.Would definitely come back again.Loved the food,after eating you can stroll around the waterfront.Beautiful views of Marina Bay Sands and the city:))))
4
We came across this place quite by accident in 2010 and we were quite glad for its existence this trip. We arrived late at night and had decided to see Singapore at its best time of day where we could take photos with no care for people getting in the shots. By the time midnight rolled around, we were quite hungry and needed some victuals to keep us going. So we walked to Makansutra Glutton's Bay where you are guaranteed to get something to eat even at 1AM since it doesn't shut till 2AM.If you want somewhere with good atmosphere and decent food for dinner or a very late supper, this place is good for a drop in. It's not gastronomic food and it's a tad expensive on the hawker price side but it's clean, it's open till 2AM and there is a decent variety and the food is fresh. No one hassles you to buy their wares and the ambience is quite relaxed. You're left alone to browse their menu boards and you just queue and order and pay when you know what you want.It's very busy during the conventional dinner hours but there are plenty of seats at midnight ;) The location is great because it's along the walk that takes you along the river and past the DNA bridge and Marina Bay Sands.If you're in need of a very good rojak, Botak Joe's Penang Rojak is the second best rojak I have ever had. You can also get a good durian ice kacang here. Yum
4
We ate here on our first night in Singapore and really enjoyed the buzzing atmosphere and the wide selection of food. There was a mixture of locals and tourists but definitely a tourist haunt. There were a lot of tables, but like any food court you had to hunt for an empty one (but they seemed to turn over reasonably quickly). Was very hard to decide what to have – the chilli crab looked delicious but we settled on Hainanese Chicken Rice and Mee Goreng and were not disappointed. Dinner including drinks was incredibly cheap and to finish off a good night the Marina Bay Sands light show started as we were leaving
3
You can visit there, if you are walking near Marina Bay or Esplanade at the evening. It's much expensive and the food isn't up to my expectation,.
4
Great satay, fabulous chilli crab with butter rolls to mop up juices, and amazing views while you're eating, oh! Forgot cheap, don't forget tissues to wipe face and hands. Gourmet it isn't but great hawker food it is. YUM!
4
Different from a food street in Thailand, Makansutra is a cleaner, more varied type of food street. Price was acceptable and visitors should definitely try the stingray. If you go towards the harbour side, you will get a nicer view. But those who like the noise and vibe of fellow foodies will enjoy sitting right in the middle
5
Glutton Bay by Makansutra is the best place to enjoy best hawker food in Singapore - and take in the beautiful scenic sites of MBS. The choices abundance, and you can even enjoy beer towers as well. The Grill fish, Sate, Mamak Mee, Thai Food, and also Fried rice are a must - and if you dare - try a plate of Kampung spicy fried rice. Yum
4
We've heard about Glutton's Bay on our many trips to Singapore so we thought we would like to go & give it a try.. We made a trip to Singapore recently in early October when the smoke haze was quite bad but we woke up one morning to heavy rain & a thunder storm that cleared the haze & we could see the sky! We made up our minds to try out Glutton's Bay as it's open only after 5pm & it's outdoors. We went on 2 different nights & enjoyed the experience. We walked our way from the City Mall to the Bay it took us around 15mins & all underground through the City Link.. shops & interesting things to see along the way. We followed the directions through the Esplanade Mall & all the way out to the bay area. We got to Glutton's Bay around 6pm, seats were a plenty, not crowded at all so we checked all the stalls & ordered what we wanted, we were surprised everything was ready in about 5 to 10mins some stalls gave a buzzer which went off when the dish was ready & some asked to come back after 5 or 10mins to pick it up. Food was delicious, around 12 stalls in all with a variety of dishes & lots of seafood choices. On both visits we spent around $50 Singapore. We even got a short concert on the way back to our hotel in the Esplanade Entertainment Centre on our first visit & the second time we stayed for the light show at Bay..
2
A noisy and hot location to try various local dishes purchased from stalls. The food is overpriced and not that good. Also, the stands are cheap and did not even provide napkins. Singapore has too many good places to waste time on a slum like this
5
A splendid spot for an exotic tasty evening meal. Wedged between the busy Raffles Boulevard and Marina Bay, it attracts a delightful zephyr from the bay to cool the evening. The range and quality of food available is a delight to the eye and the pocket. Sales staff are polite & patient - they do not "push" their wares onto unsuspecting diners.Definitely worth a meal or three during your next visit
3
Just like food court or hawker center but more clean and better view. I try ice kacang, ice durian cendol, rojak and chili crab. The taste is so so, not bad but not special. The price is not too cheap but not expensive.The best things is the location. Near esplanade, near the river, near from MRT station Raffles Place (walking about 10 min). They open from 5pm. Many kind of foods and satay.
5
Great local food + good location = happy tummy! From satay to noodles to sting ray to Filipino dishes, mouth watering food at your fingertips. We didn't even get to desserts because we were so full from all the food! Definitely recommending the grilled sting ray, chicken wings & crispy baby squid
5
Love it. Great food, cold cold beer, great setting. Food is fresh and big sized serving. Wonderful choices. Right on the Marina so good for catching the evening breezes. Prices are very very reasonable when only a few steps away there are restaurants and hotels with menus that are extremely pricey and not necessarily better
4
We went on our first nite in Singapore. It was as good as i remembered a few years ago. Cheap tiger beer great satays and seafood dishes. Packed . Beer waitress. Take your own tissues or wipes. No serviettes.great meal outdoors
5
To cut the story short, I had fun eating. I wanted to taste food from each stall but I was so full. I'll definitely be back when I visit Singapore again.
5
A-MA-ZING Satay Gado at this place. There is a very nice vibe with all kinds of people mixed just enjoying there food. Lots of options to choose from that you don't know where to start!
4
OPENs in the evening only.
One of the better Satay stalls in this part of town - Much better than Satay by the Bay at the Gardens. Mutton satay is the best seller and sells out first.
2
"Its an impromptu plan of heading over for dinner to Makansutra since ive always been going to Lau Pa Sat & Newton Food Centre. Had satay,gado gado and omelette oyster since me & partner didnt eat much. The satay gravy was super thick but cant compare to my favourite satay shop at Lau Pa Sat. Next,gado gado the gravy was just same as the satay gravy. Portion was little and the potato was hard and not chewable at all. Maybe didnt boil and cook properly. Disappointing. Im glad i didnt pay much for all. Omelette oyster was nice and lovely. Place was not much of local. Lots of foreigners. Worse of all i catch a glimpse of a rat nearby the bushes. I think it needs to step up its hygiene inspection in that area. Very bad not coming back at all."
4
Me and my other half tried here twice, and although it was mega busy on the saturday (quieter sunday) the food was amazing. open at night time 6pm-3am I think, not the day as well. A great spot and a lovely spot to eat in. If youre nearby check it out. Its great value too. But if its busy find your seats first and one of you should save them; it gets pretty mani
3
Fantastic views and location but the food is not the best in some of the stalls. Not cheap.The only food stall I could recommend is the roti stall. Try the murtabak. If it is busy (usually always) you need to get used to people standing over you by your table, waiting to nab it once you finish - can be a little off putting. Is only open for dinner
4
We had dinner here on our last night in Singapore. The place was busy and finding a table wasn't easy but we eventually sat down and shared a table with a couple from Perth.There is a really great selection of food here, we ended up getting the satay sticks which were pretty good although some of the beef was a bit fatty and chewy. We also got some chicken fried rice which was delicious. I then also got a chilli crab as i had read that this was one of the signature dishes of Singapore. I probably wouldn't order this again. I was only provided with chopsticks and a plastic fork so had to crack all the shell with my hands, getting the crab meat out was a challenge then i wasn't able to find any napkins anywhere to wipe my hands with. Besides the chilli crab the experience was pretty good and we would eat here again.The wait time for food was around 15 minutes which wasn't bad considering how busy the place was
4
Packed to the hilt with not only locals but of course tourists......get here fairly early although I think we arrived about 6.45 and managed to get a couple of seats. It's not a huge area it's in but a line of stalls on the left as you go in and tables and chairs on the right. Everything from seafood, satays, omelettes, noodles, cold juices and rice dishes. We had a mie goreng with chicken, spicey.....needed a lemon juice....and great beef and chicken satays. It was so great to sit among the low murmur of happy eaters then wander down to the edge of Marina Bay where there was a bit more of a breeze to cool down a bit and watch night lights slowly emerging from tall buildings and the giant wheel and boats on the water. So peaceful....A definite must if you want inexpensive meals in an atmospheric setting. I paid $10 for two plates of the noodles and the satays cost $6. Can't do better than that! And we were full up. Oh yes, you pay and order then take your receipt and wait nearby then come back in a few minutes with your docket to pick up your meal
4
The food is decent. It's pretty much your usual hawker food with a little more dazzle of being there rather than under an HDB somewhere.The prices are not too bad.What really makes this place is the view it gives of the Singapore skyline. Astonishing.Seriously, great to have an outdoor meal with friends, especially tourists.Some pointers:-Come early. Place gets packed.-Don't do lunch. Too hot-Find a good spot with a view-When in a tropical country, stay hydrated!-Have fun!Average budget for a meal: $10 a pop. Not bad, right
4
Grab a seat and enjoy the cheap yet excellent food and the cold beers in the relaxed atmosphere of these stalls! Great if you want to loose the financial etiquette.
5
Go here if you want a good, cheap meal. So much to choose from but the satays are our favourite meal. Comes with cucumber, rice and a delicious peanut satay sauce. Try this place to eat when in Singapore. Always a very busy place.
4
I had a fun night with my friends in Makansutra. They have a lot of food variety. We tried the famous Chili Crab (overrated for me), Chicken Satay, Oyster Omelette (my favorite) and a lot more.The location is good as it is near to Marina Bay Sands.The place is crowded and noisy so don't expect it to be a superb dining experience, just have fun and enjoy the food
4
This made a welcome break from eating in the many stylish and expensive Singapore restaurants. The food was good, cheap and the atmosphere was buzzing. We had fun strolling from stall to stall and deciding on what to eat. Value, it's great but don't expect Michelin starred food
1
This is the place to go to if you want a taste of dismal, mediocre Singapore hawker food at high prices in a touristy setting.My friends and I came here not by choice but because the restaurant we wanted to dine at was closed. Makansutra became a convenient alternative. We ordered satay, mee goreng, roti prata, Hokkien mee, char kuay teow and two young coconuts. Although Makansutra is supposed to provide a good representation of Singapore hawker food from good hawkers, the quality of food was terribly dismal. For tourists who have not tasted what authentic Singapore hawker food, they have no basis for comparison. Makansutra becomes a new and exciting experience and the dismal food becomes great food because it is tasty and they do not know what to expect. Unfortunately, these tourist would give Makansutra a good review. What keeps Makansutra going are the unwitting tourists who provide a constant stream of one-time diners.We literally spat out our first sip of the coconut water as it tasted sour and rancid. No surprise as they were precut, stored and sold at room temperature. The hawker who sold that to us should be fined for selling food / beverage that is spoilt and not for consumption

Went at about 8pm on a Tuesday night and it was super busy. This was due to a conference hosting their people there for dinner. Eventually got a table and the food was very nice although there was a 45 minute wait when ordering. Would definitely recommend it for the food which was authentic
3
The place is famous among tourists. We went there to dine and there are lots of choices around. The chili crab was said to be the best but I was not that amazed with it. The satay sticks were good but I tried one at a different place and its way better. The food could have been more tastier but for tourists who do not have much time to try other food shops or hawkers then this is ok. You cannot comment well if there is no comparison.

I highly recommend u bring ur own wet napkins if u plan on eating their chili crabs. (Which I thought was just ok, but then I'm not a big crab person).Has great Hainan chicken rice and hokien fried noodles though. Very tasty. Some other options include Cantonese and Thai cuisine.Very busy - might take a while for u to find seating. Not exactly sanitary but it's on Esplanade waterfront walk area, so probably better than some of the real hawker stalls. Yummy food all around - would go again.

It has rojak, sambal, sisig, satay and chicken rice. Pair your meal with sugarcane juice. Tasted two weird (but good) food: carrot cake (no carrots, just flour and sauce. Surprisingly it tastes like meat) and indonesian vegetable dish ( i swear it has flower shaped kropek in different colors)
5
In general hawker centres are a place to eat in Singapore. There are a lot of food choice and its cheap, especially if you compare it against any restaurant with proper seating. However you must be prepared for a seat game, which is quite annoying but in the end you get a reward of delicious food.During our 7 night stay in Singapore, I think we had dinner here at least 4 or 5 times. By the 3rd time we had a strategy of coming a bit later, for a better chance to get a seat sooner and less ppl overall.So if you are willing to postpone your dinner till 9pm or later, you'll find this place relatively empty. Well, not really, but at least you won't have to spend 15 min trying to see an empty seat then make your way to it earlier than all the fellow diners.Food are more hit than miss and portions are generous. We particularly liked the seafood stall in the end with the offer of 2 chili crab or lobsters for 40 SGD. Lobsters had significantly more meat in them somehow. Oh and make sure you bring plenty of tissues with you, you're gonna need them
4
one of the cheapest food you will surely fell in love with.$50 sg is more than enough for the couple.plus the scenery of the place at night. Very Good!
4
This is my first time to go to Makansutra Glutton's Bay and my reaction was "WOW". If you are a foodie, than this is one of the best place to come and visit. But remember, they open at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. So, don't come too early. I would say, come at around 6.30 to 7pm. We came here around that time and the food stall are all ready and it is not too crowded, so its easy to find the best seat. The latest you come, the more crowded it can be. After you are done with dinner, you can stroll along the river and enjoying the view of marina bay sand, the merlion, etc. In short, the food and the view are both amazing. Worth to go. Easy to reach by bus from orchard road. Take bus #111 from the stop in front of Lucky Plaza and get off at The Esplanade. Other bus will be bus #171. To get back to orchard road simply take the same bus.
4
On first look here it seems as if everyone else knows what to do and you don't. However, after a while it becomes clear and amongst the madness of it all there are a number of hawker stalls each offering their own specialities at very good prices. The process appears to be that having decided what you want at a particular stall you make your order, pay your money, receive a number or ticket and then hang around until your number is called. The crowds help to create an atmosphere of noise and confusion but the food we had did taste very good. Drinks are sold from a separate staff and palm juice was a favourite of ours. We had trouble finding seating and on a couple of occasions took our food over to the esplanade to eat and watch the passing traffic in the Bay. We went as it was opening on one occasion and whilst quieter we had seating and less frenetic ordering to cope with. If I were going back to Singapore it would be on my list to revisit
5
Unlike other places and restaurants in Singapore, I find their meals cheaper here. It's not only cheap but also delicious. You have a lot of choices here. I just don't like it when my request to lessen the chili was not fulfilled. I love their iced tea here! You should also be prepared to be exposed to some smoke and heat here
1
So. After hearing about this place as being the must place to eat in singapore we were severely disappointed not to mention SICK!!!The vendors were rude and over stretched. They couldnt cope with the amount of patrons. Couldnt find a table or spare seats. Managed to share one with another willing.couple. bit far from the river front so doesnt feel like river front dining. Had mee goreng, satay and roti prata. Over rated. Next day i was sick and vomited lots. This was the only place i had eaten at all day.A disappointment will not recommen
5
Every time we go to Singapore this place is first on our hit list. The venue is by the Bay an the atmosphere amazing. The satay sticks are to die for and super cheap and then you walk down to one of the last stalls and there it is CHILLI CRAB yummmmmmm yummy. OMG its amazing the best in Singapore. So Satay sticks, Chilli Crab and a jug of Tiger on a warm night in Singapore overlooking the bay ' what more could you ask for'. We will back again and again.
5
Walking around the bay watching the light show and taking touristy pictures we needed food. Little did we think that here we would find an authentic choice of cooked on the spot, locally eaten fayre and cheep too. We had just paid $14 for a beer so when we turned the corner and saw this array of colour, hustle and bustle we had to look further. This street is full of local producers cooking food there and then for a crowd of hungry locals and a few tourists. Having been to a different hawkers market in china town the prices here are comparative so not increased for the tourists. We opted for hainanese chicken which comes with rice and a clear soup. All for $4.50 (Singapore $$'s) each. The food was delicious, filling and by looking around enjoyed by many. Even if it's a one time thing go and look, I'm sure the smells will entice you to eat
4
Food variety is really vast. You cant go here and not have the cereal prawns.. chilli crabs and some mantao buns. All the food is awesome. Chicken wings is also a mainstay.Only problem with the place is its so crowded and its hard to find a seat so expect some waiting time
4
Been hearing bout this place so decided to give it a visit one night. There are few halal options but some offer no pork, no lard like the Thai & seafood stall at the very end. Decided to go for that, the ikan pari was very tasty, there's a lot of meat, just the right blend of spiciness, well worth the $12. Marina Bay Sands made the ambience more appealing. The tables & surroundings need to be cleaned more.
5
This is a VERY popular night time eating spot in the Esplanade Park. Great alternative to overpriced restaurants in that area and an awesome way to try local specialties. It is open late, at least until 10 or 11 and is always packed with people.Popular item is the chili crab, you can get 2-3 for about $40. It's not very spicy, but not a complex dish and wasn't my favorite. A MUST HAVE is the chicken rice, a dish of roasted chicken, broth and rice that sounds so simple yet amazingly flavorful and complex. Chicken satay with peanut sauce was also very good.A key to eating here is to find a table before ordering because you may have to literally stalk people who are finishing their food to get a table. Once you have a table, it's easy, not the most refined dining environment, BUT Singapore is probably the only place in SE Asia to try all the tasty street food without risking regretful tummy problems the next day.
1
The worst ice kachang you will find in the whole of Singapore. Ice was shaven too coarsely. Syrup was tasteless. Atap seed was hard. Red bean was not cooked properly.
Drink store side by side was touting badly for business
4
Lots of people and a line of Asian food stalls, add a humid evening then you're in for an experience. I dare you to enjoy the chaos :) A relatively cheap place to eat and you won't go wrong here!
3
This is a VERY popular Hawker centre, probably due to its great location at The Esplanade and its reputation, which precedes it, so everyone wants to go and have a look-see.It was packed-out the night we ate there, with tourists and locals alike, and it was pretty hard to find a seat but sharing a table is considered quite acceptable, which is what we did. It took the woman clearing the tables a good while to get round but she made a valiant attempt to create order from the chaos in a very good-humoured way.There are the usual array of stalls and food available, from chilli crab, chickenrice, satay, stingray with chilli sauce etc.We had a couple of different dishes between us and it was ok, a bit bland, but cheap and filling at approx $S6/7(Â£3/4) a dish, as well as some satay which was good.It's good to experience the noisy but good-natured atmosphere though
4
It was a busy crowd as expected on a Saturday. I love their steamed chicken rice. It's what I would go there for. My friend ordered the rojak and garlic scallops. i'm sold on the garlic scallops and chicken rice. A good eatery to go to before hopping for the concerts
3
Visited this place on a Friday night and it was very crowded, mostly Filipinos. We tried the stingray with chili sauce which was just average in taste, hokien mee, roti prata which im not a fan, chicken satay which i really loved! The meat was tasty itself. For drink, i had sugarcane juice which i also loved. Maybe I'd comeback to try the others.
4
Visited for the first time with a couple of friends. We had crabs, fried rice and chicken satay. Our food was tasty and nice, but we have to wait for a few minutes for a vacant table and have to flag down somebody to have our table cleaned. Very crowded place. Prices reasonably
4
I was having an evening walk in MBS, and then we got hungry and went to Glutton Bay. I ate there once on 2013, at that time I ate the seafood. But this time, I ate the Chicken Rice, because the two previous day was also about Chicken Rice, so it feels like a Chicken Rice Hopping. I have no complaints with the Chicken Rice here, though I've taste a better one before. Then I ordered the Lemon Ice Tea to boost my mood before night. It was so refreshing. Some thing about this place reminds me of PRJ (Pekan Raya Jakarta) in Indonesia. :
4
I am amazed seeing so many people from different culture mingled in the open restaurant. The atmosphere is fantastic offering plenty choice of various Asian and mixed food in reasonable price. You should come early to get table. The Thai food stall seems to be the favorite one as it always have long line of queuing. Thanks to my colleagues who lived and brought me there I did enjoy the sort of United Nations gathering ;) After dinner we enjoyed the performance of laser attraction nearby the restaurant area
5
A friend invited me here, obviously, they offer great foods because the seats almost ran out. But luckily, got a chance to seat somewhere facing the Marina Bay Sands. Loved the Baby Squid and the BBQ Squid, though not into spicy foods, I have learned how to love spicy foods because of this! Surely, I will be back
2
Prices are higher than other hawker centers, but the quality of the food doesn't measure up to Maxwell or Newton or Tiong Bahru, which are the more authentic hawker centers. But if you're booked in one of the nearby hotels, don't want to go far, or are looking for a taste of local food plus a view, then this could suffice
4
This is a must visit for late night snacks and offers a whole variety of south Asian foods from satay to peppered crab. Also it is within walking distance of the hotels in the marina Bay Area.
5
Love eating here - it has a great vibe, hard to decide what to eat, and if there are no tables it's quite good to get takeaway and sit down by the bay and watch the laser light show across at the Marina Bay Sands
3
I ordered Char Kwey Teow which was lacking in the characteristic flavour of the dish. My coconut milk was warm which was disappointing. Everything was rather rushed and cramped, however that said it had atmosphere and I would be happy to give it another go.
5
We made a repeat visit here after enjoying our visit last year. We had Chilli Crab, 4 mantous (buns to mop up the sauce), Sambal Sotong (bbq squid) and Singapore noodles coming to about S$43. An enjoyable meal to finish off the evening after the laser show :
4
Just had dinner there, we were recommended to have the BBQ fish and the chicken with wings, we tried and they were right! Both meals are great! When we were there, too many people I guess this place is famous! I will be back and next will be early dinner!
4
This review is a bit late as we ate here in April 2015We were staying at The Mandarin Oriental for a special occasion and stumbled across Makansutra Glutton's Bay by accident while walking around the bay,The hawkers were setting up as we headed back to the hotel and my partner wanted to go back for dinner as it was across the road from our hotel.We got there at the perfect time as the sun went down as there were not to many people there yet, we ordered 2 serves of Satay Sticks (which are a lot smaller than what you get at home) and a plate of Fried Rice from 2 stalls next to each other.The food was very good, much nicer than the food we had at another street eatery.We were lucky enough to get a table to ourselves as it wasn't overcrowded but would have been fine if others wanted to join us, our meal and a couple of soft drinks cost us about 16 Singapore dollars, my partner wanted to go back for more fried rice but the lines by then were too long.When we go back next year we will be going back to Makansutra Glutton's Bay
4
really, tried a few more around and were just rip offs. Go for this one and don't be shy to share the table, gets quite crowded. Enjoy the local style of dining, defo get the satay and after just order a few small dishes, try a bit of everything. Don't forget that you probably won't get tissues and you will need them, buy for 30c from the drinks counte
5
Right by the bay, lots of food choices.find a table, then select any combinatiin of foods from the stalls. Eveything we tried was tasty and well priced. Also time your meal around a walk round the bay in time to see the sound and light show
4
I was walking along the bay and I discovered this amazing place! The Food is delicious, the prices reasonable and the view is stunning (Marina Bay Sand Hotel), You just want to order and eat everything in this place...I came here every single day I was in Singapore! Not To Be Missed Guys.
5
Went to Makansutra Glutton's Bay for an early dinner tonight. I'm sure that there are many reviews on TripAdvisor for this place that will be far better than mine. However I couldn't not do a review. The food was excellent and real value for money. We had Satays and Murtubak with a refreshing lime juice. It was only a light meal but I'm sure you would be ery hard to please if you didn't find something to please here. The Chili Crab looked really nice and the multitude of choice made it difficult to decide. We will be back for more
5
Great spot for a casual stroll at night to catch the breeze and city lights. Eat cheaply at Gluttons Bay (Makansutra Hawkers Centre) where you can have a great view for local prices.
1
The name of the openair food place is Gluttons Bay..apologies..googled and saw photos of same food place under Simply Peranankan...Everything i reviewed is pertaining to Gluttons Bay..not Simply Peranankan. Appreciate that the correct and accurate photos of specific food places be put up.This to avoid being mislead by photos..thus also the erroneous name of place reviewed. Please accept my sincere apolgies..Simply Peranakan restuarant..It should be Gluttons Bay..please refer to my previous review..thks.
3
We went here as a family as it was close to our hotel.Unfortunately we came just after a large shower and as it not undercover it was difficult to get anything dry to sit or eat on - which was a little unpleasant to say the least. With plenty of inexpensive food on offer this is more of a traditional outdoor hawker experience than others in Singapore - so if you want to try a slice of 'old times' you should give this place a try
5
The food here is amazing and the vibe is great. There are a lot of options because there are multiple stands with different kinds of food, so you're not only limited to one thing. We had the chili crabs, fried carrot cake, satay, chicken rice, duck rice, and ice kacang (it's like snow cone) for dessert. We had a few other things, but I can't think of the names of it, but this place is an amazing place to eat. MUST GO!!
4
Had heard a lot about the hawker centres in Singapore so visiting as many as possible was no 1 on my wishlist. This one was the closest to our hotel, about 10 minutes walk. This place opens around 5:30 and when we reached at 7:30 it was packed. Looked around for a table and found one in 5 mins. The location of this open air hawker centre is great . You are close to water and can see the marina bay sands and the lit up buildings of the downtown around you. You can also appreciate the light show while having dinner here. Coming to the stalls. .. There are about 10-12 stalls here. The first two serve desserts and drinks. Having sugarcane juice here is a must & Costs less than 3 $ for a glass .Lots of Singaporean specialists here.. We had the chilly crabs with the small buns- Awesome.. The chicken and mutton satays were great too. Had the mee goreng and murtaba... Little greasy but great taste.Having food at hawker centres in singapore is a lovely experience and beats eating at a restaurant any day hands down. So go to makansutra gluttons bay ... skip lunch & stuff yourself with all the yummy gorgeous food!!
4
This is one of those places you'll never forget. Just off the Esplanade with stunning views of the Singapore city scape, this amazing buzzing, fizzing dining experience is a must. Tables down the middle of the street - get one first before you order your food - and down one side an exhausting array of various different stalls offering delicious Far Eastern fare. Your eyes will probably be bigger than your stomach but, hey, it's good fun and not expensive so enjoy
5
Finally got here at the end of my trip and wish I'd gone sooner. Loved everything about it - the food is incredible and the prices so so reasonable. Would be hard to blow your budget here.Downside is finding a table - be prepared to wander for a while and potentially share with strangers but I actually think this added to the experience. Would 150% go again
4
Super location for a hawker centre, right next to the bay. Went on a Sunday evening and it was very crowded, including a lot of locals (so much for the other reviews which seemed to suggest the place was touristy). Prices apparently higher than what you pay at regular hawker centres, but this will not be apparent to the average tourist - the location does command a premium. We had a great meal!
3
Walked through this food court and returned to try the following night. Food was ok but nothing you couldn't get in a basic Asian restaurant. It's not well organised and if you don't want to eat with chopsticks too bad. My husband asked for a fork and was told "no". He ordered two main courses from two different stalls and by the time he got back to the table the food wasn't warm enough. He couldn't be bothered asking for drinks, too much hassle
4
Don't let the name of this makan stall put you off.... it's well located alongside the F1 race track and close to the waters edge at Marina Bay.Whilst there are only 12 stalls currently, there is no shortage of any Asian cuisine you fancy and generally the standard of food is very good. As with most makan stalls there will be the odd disappointment. It is an order/pay/collect system with plenty of tables & chairs, good lighting and as with most of these well patronised food markets, it pays to dine early as it very quickly becomes crowded.Non- alcoholic liquid refreshments are plentiful from one stall but be prepared for a very limited selection of beer. Prices are typical of what you would expect to pay for this sort of selection, and the food is mainly inexpensive. Be advised that this a BYON market..... bring your own napkins/serviettes.... the stalls do not provide them and as everyone will know, it's impossible to eat Asian food without getting sticky fingers.May not be a regular for some, but it deserves to feature as at least a oncer
3
There are not many stalls there, just around 10. We tried couples of them, including oyster cake, hoi nam chicken and deep fried chicken wings. Foods are just average. If you are looking for good food, maybe you can try somewhere else.
4
Travelled with family, a friend brought us here. She let us taste the stingray, satay, and other dishes with names that I can't remember anymore, hehe
5
this is an open air food market that has been re-created. There used to be many of these food markets 30 years ago, but with the modernisation of Singapore, they disappeared. There are many tables, chairs and umbrellas, but go early as it fills quickly. Also, not a good idea in wet weather. The food is good and fresh and produced by families who have had a long history with the food markets.I'm vegetarian, so I was able to tell them what I could and couldn't eat. I had a delicious meal for $5. You will find Makansutra gluttons Bay near the floating stage & grandstands on The Marina
5
There are a lot of food stalls here to explore and temporarily quench your thirst of (good) food addiction. Various asian food style and countries can be had here for a paltry sum of money. Made a mistake of eye bigger than one's stomach on first visit, but well worth the novice experience...no wonder they are located at Glutton's bay and everything just looks so good!Food court can be really busy and hard to find a table, ask a local when is the best time to eat here, or just take your chance..
1
If you just want to try some local food, just go to the food court located in marina square or satay by the bay.The price is ridiculous and the food really taste horrible to our local food standard. We tried satay with prawns set (horrible taste - overcooked), hokkien mee (not tasty, mee and bee hoon not cooked well), seafood chilli crab (please ensure the person ordering is a local - Singaporean to ensure the quality of food. It was still acceptable since the stall owner knew that we were locals didn't overcharge us and gave us pretty ok crabs). The sugarcane drinks are pretty good but price is truly for tourist.But I must admit, the view was great if you seated to oversee the Fullerton hotel and MBS especially evening till night, So I won't recommend those to visit there for food but rather for enviornment
5
This is a wonderful place to go to for delightful local cuisine. There was six of us and we tried the Chili Crabs, Rojak, Indian Fried Noodles, Satays, Stingray and Crispy Squids. Whilst they were all good, the pleasant surprise was the indian Fried Noodles, All six of us enjoyed this dish so much and we had to order a second plate. The backdrop where we sat was simply breathtaking with the Marina Bay Sands, LV Store and the serenity of the bay making dining at this venue a real treat
4
We went to this place as recommended by the lonely planet guide and must say we loved it!It's a small hawker with amazing views to marina bay sands and the city. Most of the stalls had the sameKinda food but only one was allowed to sell drinks and desserts. $5 for Tiger and $1.70 for home made iced tea, you can't go wrong with those.I ordered medium pad Thai, it was delicious but I recommend going for the large plate if you don't want to find yourself snacking something later.I would go back defo!
5
This is a little street food type set up, with several food stalls and a juice bar. It is right next to the Marina, in an upmarket area of town, so we assumed it would be expensive but it wasn't. We had amazing chicken wings and chilli crab here - two large ones for 70 dollars. The fried rice was amazing, and the lady remembered us from 2 days before so service felt personal! Lovely atmosphere, location and food. Gets busy, so you need to have a hawkeye to spot tables
4
We arrived late at Singapore. Check-in at the nearest hotel and run to Makansutra. The food ranges from cheap to fine-dining prices. Your choice. We just order the 'famous must-eat food while in SG', the Chicken Rice. There's a lot of people I think it was around 11pm already. Ordered a take out and run to our hotel. I was thinking to order 2 Chicken Rice, but having eaten it, it's more than enough that makes a hungry man satisfied. I'd like to comeback here for nomnoms
4
Attended with friends whilst visiting Singapore on a conference. Market was easy to find and the prices are much cheaper compared to local restaurant prices. Huge range of food to eat and I'm sure there is something for everyone. Food was of great quality and service was good except for the Roti man who must have thought he was doing everyone a favour by cooking for us.A must do whilst in Singapore
4
Beautiful view of singapore. The bloke at the roti stall was a bit of a lost sheep, seemed to have no idea who ordered what. The rojak and char kway teow were decent.
4
We had a great time! Crispy shrimp with crunchy flakes was my fave. We ordered so much and I think we really had to do that to justify its name. It was a great experience all in all
2
Really horrible food for the halal stalls. The bee hoon soto ayam is bland and the chilli taste bad. The satay is cold . First & last experience.
3
We went there around 10 pm for late dinner after arriving Singapore, it was still crowded with people, both locals & tourists. There are many stalls selling different cuisines, mostly are Singaporean food.We ordered the Singaporean signature food, Chilly crab, & then barbecued prawns, satay beef & pork, vegetables & the Singaporean salad (I forgot the proper name). They are delicious and we could finish all. However, both of us fell very thirsty after the dinner and had to drink lots of water. From my experience, it's no doubt with quite a lot of "MSG"
4
I have visited Makan Sutra at least 5 times until now. It is a nice place to experience street food from Thai, Indonesian, Hong Kong, Chinese, Malay and other Asian food. Almost on all occasions we have found the place to be crowded. If you are in a bigger group of more than 10 people it could be difficult to find a place. In terms of food you are spoilt for the choices. There is seafood, meat and other delicacies to choose from. You can order from any store & eat in open space. The place has ceiling fans but if the outside temperature is more it can be very hot. A caution for vegetarians. There are very few choices to chose here. The place serves beer along with fresh fruit juices. You can really experiment from all types of food for reasonable prices. All the food I have tried here so far is good. Mostly you have to do self service. The place is open till 2 AM in the morning and can be good option to have late night street food. In the deserts try the deep fried banana desert. It is very good. The view of Marina bay & surrounding area is an added advantage.
5
We were spoilt for choice of dishes at this outdoor modern hawkers food market. Relatively clean and a great location added to the whole experience. We were recommended to go there for the satay and it certainly didn't disappoint. Very reasonably priced too. In fact, we can't wait to go back.
5
The food here is excellent plus you can get a view of the bay. Ok so its more expensove than the other hawker markets but the position is great. I have been here twice and just love it. We had chilli crab, peanut satay kebabs, scallop spring rolls with the most amazing sauce and the rest I forget. Basically it was fantastic and highly recommended
4
Across the road from the Mandarin Oriental is a street of fantastic street food stalls. It's cheap, chaotic and fun. The food is pretty good especially the satay stall. I avoided the bright orange crabs but they seemed pretty popular. It serves tourists and locals alike but it gets very busy. When it does you just have to keep your eyes peeled for a fee seat and not be shy about grabbing half a table if a seat comes spare! Beer can be bought by the jug and there are fresh juices to be had. We had a great time, and it's pretty cheap. Good evening out
3
Lots of varieties of foods. They have sizes of crabs to choose from. The medium sized crabs was around 15SGD. Too many people eats in this place, so you should wait for a table to be emptied. Too crowded maybe because its Chinese new year when we go there to meet my friend/classmate who lives/works in Singapore. Im sure I'll be coming back to this place when I visit SG again with my family
3
Touristy place, with great atmosphere and nice view once sunset. Food wise is okay, pretty much local culinary. Since the targeted market is different, thus price wise is a bit north, not really that expensive but definitely not as cheap a local food can be. Anyway, good place to hang around with friends. A pointer, try to arrive before dinner-rush hour as place not really that big and get filled rather quickly
4
Went there two times and the first, it was absolutely packed! All stores appeared to have an "A" rating. Great food, great prices especially the seafood. Cheaper to get you fix of chilli mud crab here.
5
This little street market/open air restaurant is a gem. Plenty to choose from, everything is delicious and freshly cooked right before your eyes. Very good value for money too!
4
A real experience, so different from the 'western' restaurants to be found in Singapore, as in most other cities of the world. This was hectic, lively and with a wide variety of 'street' food. Worth a visit.
5
We ate here twice during our stay in Singapore and loved it. It can be hard to get a table though but the second time we went we just took the food and sat on the steps at the waters edge and didn't worry about getting a table. Very reasonably priced and great dishes. We got a tower of beer as well which worked out to be good value. Take napkins or tissues with you! Definitely worth checking out
4
I tempted to do culinary in Singapore as it is a one of must do activities when you are here. This place is cheaper than restaurant but better ambience than any of the hawker place in Singapore. Food selection are various, price are in a good range, ambience were also in a good crowd
5
I love how there are lotsa choices!Me and my husband are very much into trying new food, so this place was heaven for us!Everything's in here. Food from different countries, food from our country. and the tastes were real yum!I must go back there!Visited on 201
5
This restaurant area is a great place to enjoy some good food for a decent price. It has a great variety from all the small shops in the area and you better try as many as you can. It is right next to the harbour where you can enjoy a great view of Marina Bay Sands and the light show
4
It's a great place to have really good street food, all ingridients are fresh and cooked after you placed you order. A place not to miss out. You can choose from different stalls and you can actually asked 'em cook to make it in anyway you want. It's so good that getting a table can be a bit of a wait. But people are willing to share there tables as well.You want to lose weight and detox? Go have a 10 day holiday in Singapore, with its fresh, high quality and good food and lots of walking around, you'll lose 'em pounds in 10 days :
4
My family (11 people) were satisfied the quality of various local food at this place. The price is little bit expensive comparing to Chinatown Food street (Smith street), but still reasonable. Singapore is a multicultural society, therefore you can find different styles of local food at this place (Indian food, Malay food, local hawker food,...) The star of this place might be chili crab/ lobster (In my opinion). A dish of chili crab starts from 33 S$.BUT: You MUST go to this place as soon as possible. Normally, most of food stalls start their business at 5pm. But if you go to this place around 5:30pm, you will find very extremely difficult to find table, especially at the holiday or weekends. Please plan your timing sharply. It's better to go to this place before 5pm (You can enjoy beautiful view of the bay while the food stalls setup).How to get there: Via MRT Esplanade station - Then follow the direction to go into the Esplanade theater (A quite long walk 10mins + some installation art along this walk) - Then find ways to move up to Level1 - Go outside the theater by the glass-door - Turn right and goes along the theater - You will find this dining place shortly

Handy location for the hotel I was staying in and as it was Chinese New Year the whole area was very busy. Prices are much cheaper compared to local restaurant prices, but if you are going on you own like I was, you can really only try two or three dishes before it gets expensive
5
Right on the bay, with no need to spend S$500 on a hotel room for a view, you can eat here for as low as S$4 per plate. And it's cheap, clean, easy and fun. Enjoy!!
5
This is my favorite place to eat.. the location, the atmosphere.. so good. And the food, you cannot go wrong here. :)
4
This place opens at around 5pm, and it's a great place to eat Asian dishes while enjoying the magnificent view of Marina bay. Food selection is quite overwhelming, from fish, chicken, vegetables and more!
4
Great location, and views of the harbour, Singapore flyer and other central buildings of Singapore, Very compact, and less intimidating than some other hawker centres. Grab a table and see what all the stalls are serving. Maybe slightly more expensive than other hawker centres, however an easy walk from all the major hotels around the harbour
5
We stayed at the Sands and tried some food there which was good but way overpriced.This place has everything you can imagine when it come to Asian/South East Asian food.All countries have a little food stall and all the workers from the hotel eat there (which is always a good sign).We ate Filipino, Indian, Malaysian and several other dishes and had some beers.Its cheap as chips and there was not one dish which was not very good (to be fair if I don't like something I try and then move on but wouldn't rate it as bad food ,-)).If you are in Singapore, try to eat here
5
Of all the places here in SG, this has got to be the only place where you can have affordable delicious meals served while you enjoy the views of the Marina Bay Sands, the Helix bridge, the Merlion, and the rest of the SG skyline! I always go back here for dinner whenever I'm at SG. You can also enjoy the performances done by artists in front of the museum. Really good food at affordable prices!! with generous servings!! yum yum yum! I will keep coming back for more

Everyone loves to visit the Food Courts in Singapore despite the calorific local food: Makansutra is one of my favorites. You'll sweat off anything you ingest, so just go for it. You need never worry about sanitation as this has been taken care of by the local Board of Health. My husband always heads to the hawker selling Oyster Omelettes and that's the last I hear fro him till he's ready for dessert. I'm a Nasi Goreng, Bee Hoon, Mee Siam or chicken satay fan myself. Buy a copy of "There's No Carrot in Carrot Cake" before going to the hawker stands so you know what is in each dish and what to order. And, BTW, carrot cake is divine, carrots or not.

My partner and I had an early dinner here after hearing a glowing review from a friend who had dined there a week previously. My partner had been keen to try Chilli Crab and really enjoyed the dish he purchased. He paid $25 for a large serve which satisfied his desire for a spicy dish. I purchased some satay sticks but wasn't altogether pleased with them as the beef ones were very chewy and they were luke warm when I received them. I then purchased some lemon chicken which was very tasty - although not an adventurous choice! - and some pineapple rice. This was a very large serve and, unfortunately, we only managed to eat a few spoonfuls. I enjoyed wandering around and looking at the varied range of food stalls here. It is located close to the river and is a good spot to have a meal and people watch, followed by a stroll along the river. As we ate quite early, when we finished we sat by the river and watched a light show from the nearby buildings which was a pleasant way to cap off the evening
4
This is the place to taste a variety of local Singaporean flavours. The atmosphere is alive, sizzling aromas fill the area and the outdoor kitchens are hot and the food is plated up fresh and hot. Rich, authentic taste and to wash it down there's a special stall that sells drinks like a deliciously cool lychee drink and other local drinks.Good to have dinner with some friends and taste a bit of Singapore
5
If you're looking for casual authentic food in Singapore this place is sure to fit the bill. Great variety of Asian, Indian and Malay food that is cooked before your eyes and is cheap - average price for a meal $6S and you can buy a jug of really cold beer for $2
4
Worth a visit to enjoy a great chilli crab. Stingray OK but very fishy. Good place to go with a crowd for the night. Very busy but well organised.
4
We must visit this place if we go to Singapore. Nasi goreng kampong, teh tarik, satay, its very dellicious. I love the ambience with outdoor experience and great view. The location is beside esplanade theatre just a little minutes walk.

My colleague has organized a welcome dinner for our new colleague from overseas at Makansutra. When we arrived, we order many different dishes from most stalls for a group of 12 people. From satay, prata to seafood. We had more than 20 dishes, I think the only thing that taste good was my coke. Most of us felt that the food was below par level, although our new colleague think the food was fine. Most of us felt that we should have gone to other food center. Maybe this is place for tourist, but I felt our local delights are poorly represented. We have much better quality food elsewhere in this country
4
One of my top places to visit in Singapore - Makansutra where you can find local dishes, food are great just bring a lot of patience since this is one is jam packed by both tourist and locals. My friends and I decided to split up, ordering to different stalls, I was the one who ordered first and after 20 minutes or so, it was just in time to get our table. Food is great good for the value of money. But if you are not so good with dealing with a crowded environment it is better to skip or go there during less peak hours (which I doubt if that happens)
2
We’ve eaten here many times over the years and have never been disappointed up until this visit. We visited early so got a table no problem. It is a typical hawker market. The food was ready quickly but the quality has certainly declined. I used to love the satays but now they are not good.We’ll be looking for somewhere else next time we are in Singapore
4
I stopped to eat here about 11 pm and it was full of locals enjoying freshly prepared food and smoothies. You just walk past the various stalls and when something appeals they cook to order and bring the dish to your table. I chose a cooked salad which was delicious. Delicious food and great value too.
1
When my family visited this stall yesterday, we ordered chendol, which was of acceptable standard but came with really sour and dry red beans that felt like they had been left out in the sun for about 10 years and then for some absurd reason soaked in vinegar. In fact, maybe I should give this stall 5 stars just for their unique red beans - I mean, it isn't often that you get to taste SOUR red beans, right??? And not just sour, but also of such an exquisite stale, dry texture that you probably wouldn't be able to find in red beans from anywhere else. Granted, the sourness of the red beans was not very noticeable at first, thanks to the ample drizzling of gula melaka over the dessert masking the stale taste. However, even the sweetness could not hide the horrible dry texture, and after eating a few beans on their own, I realised that they were sour. My family concurred, so we went up to the stall owner (a lady) to enquire about it. She then presented us with a few red beans to try, and our verdict remained unchanged. She, on the other hand, insisted that they weren't sour!!!!! She even asked her co-stall owner (a guy) to try and he, too, denied that they were sour. Now I don't want to call anyone a liar so maybe there's something wrong with my family's taste buds (there are six of us, by the way). But even then, I can't see how they could miss that aforementioned exquisitely stale texture. Anyway, after we complained about the red beans, we asked for a replacement chendol, this time without the red beans. Very apparently, she was very displeased with us because she used a very rude tone with us, and even asking us to bring our rejected chendol to the table cleaner ourselves. Sensing that we weren't very welcomed, we finished off the chendol quickly and left before any more drama could ensue. All in all, very bad service, very ... unique ... red beans
4
If you're in the Marina Bay area and want a typical Asian street eating experience, this is the place. Good cheap quality food, friendly service. Its a safe area (although all of Singapore is safe). Watch the Light Show at about 8.30pm over the Bay. Fantastic!
3
Typical Singapore food court/hawker joint, nothing special. The location is in front of the Marina Bay. Outdoor setting at Marina Bay in the Night was stunning. If you try to find the HALAL food you must be aware. please choose the booth which informed Singapore halal certification or at least you must ask
3
This culinary area is located next to Esplanade-Theater on the Bay. There is an access through the theater, Esplanade Mall, to the backyard, and some 3 minutes later you've arrived.Makansutra has a beautiful view: the river, Marina Bay Sands & Merlion. You can see them all while enjoying your meal.The seatings are outdoor with some tables under a huge tent. It's just like a picnic.Various menu are here. Chinese food, Indonesian food, Singaporean food, Western food, etc. quite good-average with reasonable price. Not many option on each menu. I only give 3 stars because of the variety of menu. If i'm not mistaken, there are less than 15 stalls. Maybe even less than 10. I was expecting more than 15, with more options on Indonesian, Chinese, Vietnam, Thailand etc on the menu.I only recommend one time visit only. Just to pay your curiosity.
4
this my family favourite place for weekend.... the food there is ok but the scenery of marina bay and all tall building along there make u really feel how great is singapore.
5
Good food at affordable prices, can get very crowded on the weekends, especially. For larger groups, worth trying their set meals. Closest station is Esplanade Station and Marina Bay and the Merlion are within walking distance.
3
I've been to this place a number of times for dinner and it never disappoints, however, nor does it stand out. The one dish that does stand out is the Swordfish Sambal. It's cheap-ish and cheerful. A tad touristy.
2
The food we bought here was dry and expensive. The crab that we paid a lot for did not contain food at all. Just bones... A big disappointment.
4
I love this hawker's place - it's clean and food are delicious. They have numerous selection of fresh food to cooked. Stalls are individualize. They also give plastic gloves in case you want to eat with your hands - delicious spicy crabs.
5
Went here with some colleagues for dinner. An amazing selection of freshly cooked food, it has individual stalls that specialise in various foods, you can buy from any if them and eat in the central seating area.
A wonderful group dining experience.
4
Just a stone away from the Esplanade and Marina Bay Area. Lots of stalls to chose from....which food to sample. Great idea too that some stalls have photos of their food ..how dish is called locally and explaining what it is. Loved their Or Luak or oyster omelette
4
It was my first time to eat, the hawker experience. We order a plate of Satay in peanut butter sauce,and a bunch of very Asian dishes. I tried the Lemonade with plum and it complimented. I look for pineapple but found nowhere. The view while eating is awesome since its near the Merlion Park and Marina Bay sands. at 2 SG dollar, i was bale to buy bottled water
5
Went there on a Thursday with 2 of my friends, it was raining so it took us a while before we found a table as few tables are not used due to not having that big umbrella to shelter customers from the rain. Luckily, we were able to share a table with american couple enjoying the spicy crab. We tried grilled chicken wings, chicken rice and sauted vegies and had a very sumptous meal. The servings are good for 3-4 person and we were not really able to eat all of it. I would love to come back in here and try other stuff...
4
Stroll along the twelve stalls and pick out what appeals to you and enjoy the beautiful view of Gluttons Bay. My large plate of Mei Goreng was quite tasty and was only $4! Next time I will try the Chili Crabs. Our friends went to a fine restaurant and spent over $500 for two people. I had the real, casual Singapore experience
5
The food was tasty, especially the barbecued sting ray. We also had grilled chicken wings, seafood fried rice, clams, and stir-fried veggies. Must-try restaurant in Singapore.
4
This is a perfect example of street food for any newcomer to Singapore. Good location, open till late night. Great variety of food. Sometime hard to find free chair. Somehow napkins are always a problem. Bring your own wet ones. Lot of finger food.
4
Fantastic introduction for the family into the multi faceted cusine of Singapore. The Esplanade waterfront street laid out a feast of Thai, Malay and Indonesia food . Again... Amazing as a word seems to be small for the experience..
4
Awesome food really blend of all parts of the world from Malaysia to Indonesia to a singapore!! Love this place... Recommended the sambal stingray from the red hill rong guang BBQ seafood stall and the chicken wings too
3
A nice location with good views, seemed to be squeezed between two bigger buildings on each side. Food was nice, a bit pricier than other hawker style eateries. Plenty of tables to choose from on the night we visited.
4
First time I went on Wednesday dinnertime and it was busy but not overly packed, I had a decent chicken rice meal from Wee Nam Kee. On my second visit, I went here on Saturday night around 6:30PM and boy, it was jam-packed! The competition to get a seat is really tough too, I had to wait almost 1,5 hours just to get a seat for two. Then another 20-30 minutes wait to get our food served. Avoid this place on the weekends at all cost! If you are a first-time tourist to Singapore (or time-pressed), this is a good place to sample Singaporean cuisine
2
Very average food.My mee goreng was undercooked and was not moist enough.Standard drinks you can get at any hawker centre in Singapore.Al fresco sitting, there are some tables with umbrellas and there are quite a few tables under a long covered section in the middle, but if it starts to rain. It can get uncomfortable.Why its not terrible- convenient place to fill up your tummy after a walkabout around the area.- Not as expensive as neighbouring restaurants in the Esplanade area.ConclusionThis place is trying to capitalise on the Satay club monicker, but it is just a poor excuse for the original satay clubs of a bygone era.Not recommended. Much better hawker food can be found nearby at Lau Pa Sat especially when they close off a street at 7pm or at Amoy food centre for lunch. - both places are not too far off
5
Visited here with a large group on a Monday night and it was very busy but was able to get a table quick enough. Seemed to be a good mix of expats, tourists and locals to me and prices were fair for Singapore!Seating is close to the stalls so it seemed very hot sat down.A big plus for me is that the vendors weren't as pushy as say Newton Circus or Lau Pa Sat. The tables weren't numbered like other centres so you had to keep an eye out for your food coming round.Very close to walk round Marina Bay. merlion and Marina Bay sands approximately 10 minutes walk away
3
When going around the esplanade area, you would stumble to this area. It's crowded and not easy to find a seat. Some people were staring at us when we enjoyed our food as they wanted to have our seats. It's very inconvenient. The food is standard hawker food. There are many sellers and many options to choose. I chose prawn mee, chicken satay, India curry and naan and martabak (wrapped beef mixed with egg and green onion). There are tasty and OK
4
One of the must visit hawker shop.. You get to view the Marina Bay as well!Bus stop and MRT station are just a few minutes away.. :)Since we went there around 8pm, there's lot of people around and so the delivery of food wasn't that timely, but that's fine
3
Good local food with nice view of the Marina Bay! Had black pepper crabs and cereal prawns at one of the stalls. Prices are vary affordable too.
4
This place is not only good to see and visit because of thier yummy foods but also for the view. Vwry near to esplanade and got view of marina bay sands
5
Wow....so much to choose from and great value. The food is cooked to order and whilst it was busy, we were able to find a table easily. Very relaxed outdoor setting, good for families.
4
What a great food experience for such a short trip. We asked the taxi driver to take us to a authentic food place and this is where he drooped us off. Great food!!
5
Ome.good.thing with this place is,you hit two birds with one stone: you will get to taste authentic simgapore foodies and at the same you will have the views of singapore's famous tourist spots like. MBS and esplanade
5
Excellent place to eat, so much choice and value for money - you can sample as many different dishes as you fancy - something for everyone. The chicken fried rice is delicious as is the tempura banana.
4
I always bring overseas guests here as it offers some of "must eat in Singapore" local fare.Of late the service has improved in that the waiting time is much shorter.But what is sold here may not be the "best" but it is a good sampling
5
Hawkers are ranked as to quality and Makan Sutra permits entry to the highest rank so you'll see them all together. Add to this its location at the edge of the Marina and that makes this food place not-to-be-missed. If you time it well you can be having dinner while watching the laser light show of the Marina Bay Sands. A bit eccentrically located from the center of town but it's in my favorite area of Singapore
4
The place is excellently located with views of the bay and atmosphere is great for alfresco dining. However, I did find that it is more aimed at tourists with highish prices and taste/quality not a priority. I would still recommend it for the ambience but not for the excellence of its food
4
One of the best Pad Thai out of Thailand. Generous serving of noodles and shrimp. We also ordered the oatmeal prawns- deliciously sweet and I was craving for more. Also had their fried rice and it was very good. Their calamansi juice was heaven on a hot friday evening, costs 2 SGD. The place packed but was very clean. Despite many hungry tourists the tables were cleaned swiftly
3
cant get more "touristy" than this. Prices are high, food just okay and you have to weave around a lot of people to get tables. good view though of the Marina bay
4
Makansutra Glutton's Bay is a very good eating option when in Marina Bay area. It's a good mix of chinese, malay and hindu delights with a good balance of spend-and-save options.
4
Visited Makansuutra friday bight at 8pm place was packed. Food was excellent value for money! Only problem we experienced was finding a seat went for a nice walk afterwards will definitely go again
3
So many variety dishes, nice place to hangout, nice view (you can take photos in the park with Marina Bay Sands as the background), but the price is quite expensive (average: 12 SGD)
4
We ate here on Tuesday nite 23rd September 2014. My wife said her chicken rice meal @ $4.50 was the best meal she had had in nearly 3 weeks. Great variety of very tasty food and at the prices you can try heaps. A must to go and experience. Look forward to eating their again.Thanks allMick and Kerri
4
to work up an appetite, my friend and i walked our way to makansutra - took photos of the F1 race track and souvenir shops, watched street dancers practise and enjoyed the view of the marina sands bay. when we finally arrived, we were already starving. good thing the queues are tolerable. they have a good variety of dishes and drinks to offer. we enjoyed the oyster omelet, chicken/beef satay with rich peanut sauce and some veggies. the fresh juices from the bar are refreshing.. to enjoy your dining experience there, better to wear light clothing so you don't feel warm. the tables / chairs are closely arranged so if you want a bit of room and air, choose the tables at the sides, farthest from the centre
4
Having given up on Newton Circus as a Tourist Trap serving over-priced seafood to tourists, we were recommended this outlet by the Cabin Crew of SIA during out flight to Singapore. It was easy to find and had ample parking 5 mins. walk away. It was full of locals, which was a good sign, as tourists like us could be counted on the fingers of one hand. Its location by the Bay was great, but as we got there at the peak time, had to settle for an inside table. But the food and colour more than made up for it. By the time we finished our meal around 2000 hrs. it began to empty out. On our next visit, we will make it a point to get there around 1930, stroll on the spacious lawns at the edge of the bay and get a water-edge table around 8 p.m. and dine at leisure. A word of warning, don't mix up CHICKEN SATAYs with BBQ CHICKEN. they may look the same on the skewer in their raw state, but there is a world of difference in the end taste and experience. BTW, order the Satays first, as the minimum is 10 sticks per order, then go for the other dishes. LAMB MURTABAK, a savoury largish pancake stuffed with curried minced Lamb served with a Sambal Sauce is not to be missed. Wash it all down with an icy fold draft Tiger Beer, or a chilled Fresh Coconut. guaranteed you can't go wrong here. they don't open for lunch
5
Pardon me for the title. But that's what i could describe it. The place was a feast of different delicous viands that would really make you forget your figure. Please allow me to mention Botak Joe for having the best chili crab. Oh well it was really yummy.. Not to mention the cereal prawns.. And yes i actually did not get the recipe.. Why? Because this is something that really look forward to as I go back to SG. Satay and other mouthwatering food are also available. The lychee shake and sugar cane juice cometed the hefty meal I had. I have some pics uploaded and no filter was made!
4
We went here for a dinner as a base to later explore the scenic surroundings.We had curry, crab, satay, deep fried prawns and fried rice with a few beers.Everything where well cooked and tasty, but nothing was superb, but good.It is a scenic place and easy enough to order and get a seat.Price is OK, but be aware to ask for the fixed price of the seafood and don't get fooled by the price per 100gram that could be perceived as the price of the complete fish or cra
4
My first time to eat in such a place and i enjoyed it. You can choose from a wide variety of food which can surely satisfy your satiety. From locals, thais, filipino etc..the place is nearby marina sands and merlion park. Wherein you can just stroll and enjoy the cool breeze of the bay after, to walk off the food you consumed.
5
This food court is so far the best in Singapore The must try for me is sambal stingray with seafood friedrice baby Kailan , barbecue chicken wings and nothing beats all this food when you are with friends with a tower of beer and a great view of city skyline Must visit
5
Lots of foods to choose from, cheap eats and lots of varities. You just need to have a good eyesight to make sure you won't miss a vacant table and be quick. And make sure to have cash with you. I'd definitely come back and have a full meal here again
3
According to my coworkers, out door eating has a bit of a history in Singapore and Glutton's Bay is but one example. Expect to pick and choose from a variety of local dishes, from huge prawns to Chili Crab, to carrot cakes to roast chicken. Flashy, it isn't, but its close to downtown and will let you sample much of the core of local cuisine
5
While visiting Singapore, I tried numerous hawker centres and the food available there. The Glutton's Bay Hawker Centre is the all stars of the Singapore hawker food vendors. I'm sure how they select who gets to sell food here, but I tried quite a few of the vendors and all were excellent. Slightly more expensive that other Hawker Centres, but worth it. You won't be disappointed
4
Go casual and join the throng of happy people at Glutton's Bay for a 'local feast'.. Chilli crab is top of the list for me.. take some wet wipes.. it's incredibly messy.. fun and fabulous! There is an array of 'hawker stalls' all specialising in food from different regions.. and its all great value and fresh..and as clean and hygienic as any top restaurant..(you'll see the certificates proudly displayed alongside reviews from 'Serious food critics'..) The difficult part is making your choice because there's just so much! It's outdoors (with some umbrellas in case of a downpour) and very informal.. right next to the Marina.. with a great view of the music and light show every evening.. Gosh the thought of the chilli crab with the dipping breads is giving me the munchies! Need to get back out there!
4
If you're new to Singapore and you want to have a 'crash course' on hawker food, look no further. Conveniently located near hotels (beside Esplanade), tourists can easily walk to Makansutra and sample some of the hawker favorites. Be warned though, the place gets packed! Also, this place is pricier than most hawker centres.Stuff I like: Pork ribs w/ salted eggs, carrot cake, durian kacang. :
4
Food was tasty with plenty of choice, Good value eating for Singapore where eating out is a very expensive pastime. We made a lovely evening by eating at Gluttons Bay and then watching a free jazz concert by the waterfront with the Marina Bay light show in the background, We then walked down the river to Clarke Quay. Great night.We arrived at Gluttons Bay at nightfall and it was noticeable how quickly it became incredibly busy. By the time we left people were having to stand for ages to get a table. That did not look much fun so my advice would be to arrive early
5
A quality hawker center. Don't miss this when you visit Singapore. From chili crabs to tiger prawns, from string rays to chicken rice. They have it here. Ambiance is great, with a view of hotels, the bay, and the Marina Bay Sands. A bit pricey, but it's okay. Food is great. The place is always filled with tourists and locals alike. If you like eating good food with a nice view, this is the place to go
1
This place used to be,really good. But now it is just dirty place. Nobody cleans the table, there is food on the floor,chairs are sticky and the cleaning lady is just horrible. Food taste is ok not bad. But better tasty food could be had in other hawker centres.
5
I came here three times and tried everything. Chili crab (S$35 for 2), tiger & king prawn (S$40 for 3), sting ray (S$15), chicken rice, satay, mantau, etc.The favorite menu here are most probably the seafood, but the food are generally excellent. They're on par with more pricey restaurants such as No Signboard or Jumbo. Just the best seafood to be had here.Watch out the place is very crowded and there are too few seats here. Expect a struggle when you're about to eat, even in non-peak hours
4
A great food hunt, however its always packed and its very hard to get a seat. But the location is great with a nice view of Marina Bay.
3
I was brought there by a local friend, the food was tasty and cheap, definitely alright for a street food court, location absolutely great. However a bit disappointed about tables chairs and cutlery
3
With such a prized location and a small stall base, we all found something we liked. there were a few choice items such as prawns and a mango and sticky rice dessert. All a little expensive but thatis to be expected.
3
My personal favorite when I buy food here is the crunchy spicy squid and then I pair it with a glass full of sugarcane juice. There are lots of varieties of food and all will really make you feel the Singapore atmosphere. Recommended for tourists
4
A great option if you want to try a quality hawker centre. We only tried three dishes ... Black and a White Carrot Cake, followed by Sticky Rice with Mango. It was all great. We planned to eat more but had already eaten too much that day, but we'd go back again. It can be busy we'd read so we got there early-ish! around 5.30pm, but it was mid-week, a Wednesday, so was not overly busy even an hour later. My only disappointment is that I like wine not beer but beer is the only alcohol served which is probably truer to local traditions!Gluttons Bay is in a great area to walk around afterwards ... And I did find a place for my wine then
5
We have eaten here at least twice during our trip in Singapore. The price is reasonable, the ambiance is a bit crowded as it is filled with locals and tourists (definitely a sign of good food being served) and the location is great too.There are a lot of food to choose from but my top favorites would be:- The chili crab- Crispy Squid- Cereal Prawns- Seafood Fried Rice (It's super delish! I can eat it as it is!)A trip to Singapore will not be complete without having to drop by Makansutra.You won't regret it, I swear
5
I had the most delicious meal here with friends. Our taxi recommended it when one of our group asked for local food and he took us there rather than Clarke quay! We were right on the water - amazing view of the Singapore skyline with food to match.
5
Love the this. We seem to arrive on the Saturday of the rehearsals for National Day this has happen to years in a row. We love to eat here and see the fighter jets go over watch the paratroopers, but best of watch the fire works. To top off the food is,cheap and great the satay sticks with the peanut sauce is to die for. The chilli crab mouth watering and to wash it all down a jug of Tiger.. Yum yum
4
If you love cheap but really good-tasting food, and you are in Singapore, then this place is definitely for you..Many choices, good view, yummy food, relaxed & happy atmosphere...2nd time coming here and the food choices are just ssuuuuppppeerrr..Be there early because seats are going, going fast..or be ready to wait for your turn on the table..Will still recommend to try it next time in the area.
5
If you have not experienced a "Hawker Centre" in Singapore you need to do it before you leave. Fantastic variety of fresh local, regional cuisines. It is even more fun with someone familiar with these dishes as they will encourage you to be brave and try something you have never tried before
5
we eat here 3 times in the two weeks we were in Singapore and enjoyed every mouthful. I have to recommend the BBQ squid it was absolutely delicious.
4
Their sweet chili crab is the best. A good place to relax and pig out after a day tour in Singapore. Located near Esplanade mall which makes it very convenient.
4
In search for a good meal for my friend's birthday dinner, we went out to the much reviewed Makansutra. Coming from MRT City Hall Station we passed by a network of malls then went out of the Durian Buildings ( the twin buildings that look like durian fruit) and walked near the Bay Area where the Makansutra is. For directions, you just follow the signs and you won't get lost. If all else fails, just ask anybody the way to Makansutra since it is a pretty popular place. Nevertheless, the directions are what we followed and voila we found it.The place is open air sitting with a variety of food stalls and choices. You can have Filipino, Thai and other Asian cuisine. We tried some from almost all stalls. Food is good and ambiance is very local. It easily gets full though specially come dinner time. We looked for a table first then went the rounds ordering. Some stalls issue numbers so be careful not to lose them to claim your order. Prices and order sizes should be indicated when ordering to avoid confusion. Good food, cheap price, ambiance is homey and by the bay view of Singapore - definitely worth going back

I love the very relaxing ambiance that this place has to offer. We dined around dinner time at 7 and timing couldn't be more perfect as there were lots of choices of Asian food from Filipino, Hong Kong's best and Thai.. Basically very delicious cuisine! Foods are reasonably priced and location is spectacular. You get a view of the Marina Bay Sands! Definitely a hotspot in Singapore dining

Best street food by far that we found in Singapore in a lovely environment.This place is clean, cheap and the food is amazing.MRT to Raffles Place and a walk along the river is beautiful.Secret is to grab seats and then go and get food individually. It's cheap, stunning quality and the setting by the water is magical.If combining either the obligatory trip to a Raffles, you can walk (10/15 mins maybe
5
We went there on a Saturday night with our two adult children and their partners and had some really great food. We had something from most of the stalls and shared it. The prices are really cheap and the food is ready quickly. The BBQ squid was particularly good.Highly recommende
5
Different stalls of different kinds of cuisines. Make sure to try the chili crab and the hainanese chicken! Secure your seats before ordering food so that you wont walk around with your trays. There's a comfort room between the stalls just in case you need to wash your hands or use the bathroom

Singapore has no street food for the last 30 years. It is a fact. Unlike in many neighbouring countries where authentic, cheap and good street food is available, we don't have that here. Unless you have travelled widely in this region, you will not know that you are paying a premium for bad food even that means cheap comparing to what you pay back home. Sadly, this is giving tourist a false impression of what good food Singapore has if you start off your food hunt here, being the first stop. Have a beer, accompanied by some light food items one of which I reckon can be barbecue chicken wings. Soak in the evening sunset and enjoy the view of the marina bay area. Go get a proper meal elsewhere. If the chicken wing are not that great, well you can be assured of a good Tiger beer to wash that down

my favorite place to eat when in Singapore, food is fresh and usually tasty. had food from most of the stalls however will not recommend all the food there. Jerry's BBQ is very tasty especially the pork ribs and squid. The guy at the very end ( can't remember the name of his stall) is also good. the indian food there is not the best and you can give it a miss
1
Being a Singaporean I have always been proud of our local hawkers centres and always recommend to my overseas friends. I went to gluttons bays the other day and ordered lots of dishes from different stalls but to my disgusts, all the dishes tasted so awful that I couldn't recognise what I was eating! And all were over priced and when I bought a coconut from the drinks store, it was warm and has gone off...I feel so let down by makansutra and the standard of food they are willing to serve our tourists and reaped them off. I left feeling so ashamed and disgusted that this could happen in this city that I am so proud to share with my overseas friends..never will I bring them back there again
5
You can find all kinds of local food in there! You see a lot of people crowding and they are not only tourists but also locals. I think it's a good sign - the quality will be perfect.
4
Visit day time ; not all kiosk open yet; still there are some open early in late afternoon; Founded on the way walked crossed Marina bay passed Helix bridge to Esplanade side on the way to Fountain of wealth Suntec city. these outdoor food court had reasonable price local food; Satay stick ; fried spring roll; chicken fried ; Indian menu / Malay menu to fill up your need
1
The location is excellent, giving a great view of Singapore's Bay area. Other than that, the place is a downright embarrassment. Awful, soulless food, dirty utensils, tables and chairs, cramped environment, and hyped up pricing makes this a tourist trap, through and through. This bears repetition: the food is by far some of the worst I have eaten in Singapore, and over time I have tasted almost all the stores. Go there, but make sure good food is not your priority
5
This is one popular, must-eat dining place in this city-state. With an open-air, moon-lit food center makes a fave hotspot for visitors and the sleepless. You could barely find a vacant table or a food stall without someone in queue especially at night. Try their lamb BBQ, chicken wings and local favorite, sambal stingray
4
Place has good food but it's difficult to get a table so we got our food to go.Good crab is available at the last stall near the bay.Must try is this place called Old Satay Club Mee Goreng - good service, wonderful food.Alhambra right beside it has good Satay BUT service is terrible
2
I didn't enjoy the dining experience at all. Other than its location, I wouldn't recommend this place. It was terribly crowded with people staring down at you as you are just about sit down to eat your meal, it is certainly not enjoyable as they wait beside you so that you will vacate your table as soon as possible. The food is average. The Botak Joe stall was a rip off trying to charge $10 for a plate of ngor hiang when their picture said $3 for 5 bite size pieces.The sticky rice with mango for $6 is not nice and portion is small. The hokkien noodles, satay ($8 for 10 sticks), chicken rice $4.50 and chendol $2.50 taste average. Definitely not going back nor taking any visitors there
3
There are places where you go just for the food or just for the atmosphere, or both. At Makansutra Gluttons Bay, I'd say people go here partly because it's by the Singapore river and you get the cool nice breeze in the evening. I understand why some people call it a tourist trap, and I totally get it. However, I see locals going there too. There's a variety of hawker stalls there, and though they're not the best of the best (do we really need the best of the best all the time?), it's a decent place to come grab some food with family and friends and have a pleasant good time
4
We were taken to this spot by a local Singaporean and due to this local knowledge, we arrived early - a tip which is highly recommended! The food is very good, with many sellers making fresh food of all varieties. The selection is huge, but so are the portions so be careful not to order too much! The one downside is the lack of seating during busy times, so aim to be there early (6 ish is ideal). However, saying this, people are happy to let you sit with them (or vice versa). Remember: it's not called Glutton's Bay for nothing
3
its definitely a popular spot among local & tourist alike because:Pro - its the only place i can think of that i can bring some tourist friends to enjoy an array of local foods and yet near to some attraction with some good view- the food is acceptable - standard tend to drop a bit when its a big crowd during weekendcons- not easy to get a table - so be there early- prices tend to be a notch higher than that of a local hawker center - we are paying the extras for the view and convenience. and the good thing is there is price list - so no surpriseTried Satay(pretty good), chicken wing(average) Chili crab(average) bbq stingray fish(average) fried rice(average) Thai style prawn (average)tips : a) be there early and be patient in waiting for your table.b) great if you can go with a local friend to help you to orde
4
Nice convenient place to eat in the Marina Bay area. A variety of good but affordable food for the tight-budgeted traveler. Friendly vendors would be happy to help you which food specialty to order. Seafood, noodles, rice meals, even beer too. Great view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Singapore Flyer while dining or just plain chilling out with friends
5
Located opposite Marina Square and beside the Esplanade, this place is a must go for food since you are already there.
5
It's a mission to get here if you ask people because locals are awful at directions but well worth it. Mixture of Malay and Chinese foods in a London Southbank style venue. Very well priced, no need to break the bank here!
4
Many stalls to choose from and my favorite here is the prawn paste chicken, it is really addicting to eat, the sting ray is good too. it is not easy to look for a table if busy hours.
4
If you love seafoods but you are on a tight budget. Better try this place. You can choose on the serving size and have a view as well of Marina bay sands. The food is and cheap. Average you will spend is $23.00/PAX (group of 5-6 ) comes together with varieties of seafood menus and vegetables.Perfect for bonding and chatting as well
5
This is my 3rd trip to Singapore and when it comes to Hawker Center this place is the Best because of the great view!Most most of the time tourist will go to Newton Hawker Center which I believe the Number place to go as far as late night dining. But this place has the food options in Newton with the good view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel and Singapore Flyer. It feels like Dining in a upper class restaurant but its a Hawker Center!Great Place!!!
4
GB is a great place for travelers to learn about eating at Hawker Centers. It's clean, convenient to the marina area, and has plenty of signage to help you. Placards explain the cuisines and ordering process. Vendors are friendly and happy to explain their specialty to you. There's a beer vendor and a great variety of cross-cultural cuisines. Late hours and an incredible view make this a cute date spot. The covered tables are coveted in case it rains, so be patient. It's worth the wait for a better table, so buy a beer and wait for a good place to sit. You can use napkin packs or handwipes to hold seats if you're by yourself. But hopefully this isn't the case. Take friends so you can share as many dishes as possible. "Die Die Must Try!!
3
Everytime my friends and family visit Singapore, this is one the places I bring them to. The place is situated right across the Merlion and the Marina Bay Sands, so imagine what a scenic view you have as you enjoy Singaporean cuisines at a cheaper price. And the taste? Actually, it is one of my favorite place to eat
4
Bear with the wait to find a seat first. Then I assure you will have a good solid meal there.Reasonable pricing. If you manage to get a good seat, you will get a good view too! Otherwise, a nice long walk along Esplanade, after your hearty meal, should do the trick
4
I bring all my friends who visit Singapore to Makansutra. I describe it to them as an "expensive (but really good) hawker center that's got a great view of Marina Bay." It's best to get there before 7pm so that it's not too crowded, and you get a seat at the side near the bay. You won't find food that's as cheap as normal hawker centers, but the selection is very good and already vetted, so you don't have to worry about not-so-good quality food. I think it's a good place to introduce Singapore food.These are my regular orders for my Singapore guests:1) Black carrot cake2) Chicken wings3) Oyster omelette4) Cereal prawn5) Fried rice6) Chili Crab (I only order the chili crab if my guests absolutely insist on it. While I find the crab very good at Makansutra, I think the first five orders are already enough to get quite filled up. Only order the chili crab if you have a huge group).So basically you can get all the "regular" Singapore food. The name Gluttons by the Bay is perfect for venue. After having dinner in Makansutra (and super full), I usually guide my guests to a walk towards Marina Bay via the colorful Helix Bridge. It gets the food down, and provides an amazing view of Marina Bay at night
5
This is not a fancy restaurant. In fact it's not even a restaurant. It's a row of about 8-10 stalls selling a variety of local specialties. You order at the stall then go find a spot at one of the outdoor picnic tables and you may have to share with others but that's half the fun. There is a huge variety but we had the Stingray with spicy Sambal sauce, grilled squid with barbecue sauce and crispy green beans. Everything was delicious. The fellow we placed our order with was very helpful explaining things. It is very crowded but lots of fun and very reasonably, actually low priced
3
Fantastic location on Marina Bay, but you don't need to eat here to get the great views. Got a range of dishes from the Thai, Filipino and Seafood stands. Dishes were ok but not worth paying the premium prices for "hand picked" hawkers.
5
It was a dinner organized by 2 of my college drinking buddies now based in Singapore during my flight layover to Dubai. The place had the usual open-air dining crowd, with a wide range of choices from each stalls.It was a cool place for night out with old buddies â€“ outdoor seats, smoking grilled shark (not the whole shark, of course!) and some bottles of cold Tiger beer. Perfectly complimented by the view of Marina Bay skyline
5
When your in glutton bay, you can not help but be guilty of gluttony. The food here are delectable and cheaper compared to other place. The view is perfect too.. with the marina bay sands and the sky scraping buildings across the bay. Just be at the place before 6 pm.. or else you will have a hard time looking for a table. After a sumptuous meal, burn out those calories by taking a hike to the iconic Merlion in front the fullerton hotel.
4
Recommended by our hotel concierge this was a great find. It was Monday night about 730 and whilst it was busy it was easy to find a table. It would be good for large parties where one can reserve the table whilst others queue at different stalls for food. As there were only two of us this was more difficult but still very enjoyable and reasonably priced
5
Really great eating place. In my mind, in Asia I prefer these types of eateries to restaurants mostly, aslong as they are clean and this one is. Its a really nice outdoor seating area with great atmosphere plus a great price! You can also watch the Marina Bay Laser show from this location
2
This is quite a small centre with only one of each type of outlet, hence there is no competition and it shows. There is very little seating considering the numbers of people eating. The food was average at best - not as good as you can find in other hawker centres. Had to wait 12 minutes for satays and nearly 25 minutes for stingray sambal. Fast food - I think not. Predominantly tourist crowd which says a lot, really
4
You really can't beat seeing the harbor lit while you dine al fresco and also getting to see all the different foods that everyone around you is eating. The selection is varied but not unbelievably so. We dined here twice during our trip and loved it but we had better actual food experiences at some of the random food centers we came across. You pay a small premium for the location but it's still worth checking out. Order the Pork Sisig from the phillipino stall
4
There's nothing here that you won't find in other hawker centres in Singapore. Nothing special. They have chilli crab, grilled chicken wings, mee goreng, fried Hokkien mee, pineapple fried, char kway teow, grilled stingray, sambal kangkong, cockles, scrambled egg with oyster, cereal prawn, sugar cane juice, ice-cold Tiger Beer, etc. People come here for the foodie experience. Queueing up for food and drinks, fighting for the last available seats.Come here for dinner, come early evening and when you're not that hungry. The queues can get a bit long and seats are more difficult to get.
4
There has been a subtle chane at Gluttons bay since we were last there in that it is now "branded" ,smarter and an attraction in its own right. Having said that the food is still excellent and great value. The setting by Marina Bay is hard to beat and there is a great atmophere. The selection of stalls seemed smaller but there was a good selection of different food to choose from. For the tourist a must but for a more authentic experience Maxwell Road is probably a better option.Having said that we will retur
5
If you're in Singapore, you have to eat at the Glutton's Bay Hawker Center. Not only is it the best food I've ever eaten, but the atmosphere is great. You have a great view of Marina Bay Sands and their water show as well as the entire Singapore skyline. My favorite dishes were the black carrot cake (Singapore specialty, not the sweet cake Americans think of, but a savory dish), sting ray (it's a bit spicy), and the chili crab. Be warned though, it's very popular so finding a table can take a few minutes
4
Very nice hawker right next to Marina Bay. I have tried many dishes and except the stingray I loved them all. (not saying it was not good but saying I didn't like it). Perfect place for a good, quick reasonably priced meal.
4
The place was packed when we got there. A lot of people just ordered food and ate it on the grass, picnic style. We ate, grilled chicken wings, chili king crab and more. All tasted good. The location is good for tourists, coz u get to see the view of marina bay sands, helix bridge, skyline and esplanade. After eating we walked to marina bay sands through the helix bridge.
3
We planned to have dinner here. After going down from Singapore Flyer we walk stright to Makansutra. We arrived around 8pm on saturday night, one week after the chinese new year. It was packed! We were looking for tables by walking a full round in it with no avail. Maybe will visit them again in less peak hour
5
You can walk from MBS and cross the Helix Bridge to come here. All the best Spore hawker food at one place. Avoid come at peak time, hardly get a table. Price relative expensive compare to real hawker food. Unless you keen to visit Tao Payoh .....
3
It's a hawker market, lots of options, friendly hawkers, decent food and good location, near outdoor concerts and the bridge to Fullerton and a nice view of the light show Marina Sands Bay. Seating is completive and the portions are big, so come with a grou
3
The main reason why my family will be here is because we have visitors who have just 1 or 2 days in Singapore and had just finished touring the area. Undeniably,it is a centrally located hawker centre for us to meet our visitors. The food is reasonably priced for tourists and varieties are reasonable. Given a choice, we will avoid the place. If you have the time to explore Singapore other than just the city area, take a train to towns like Bedok or Clementi or Ang Mo Kio...you'll be treated to authentic, delicious hawker centre food at cheaper prices. Then, take a walk around these towns. There are definitely more than just food that you can find
5
a great concept for a hawker centre for tourists. only has about 12 stalls but all have been hand picked to represent certain locla dishes ie one stall does chicken rice, another does BBQ, another chilli crab, another satay etc. the food was great. the price was pretty good considering that it is ideal for tourists with everything neatly laid out
4
A good stopover after visiting the Merlion or MBS. Seats and tables can be hard to get by so be on the look out for those finishing their food. Food are quite expensive that the regular hawker, but it is because this place has better ambiance and scenery
5
This place is frequented by both tourists and locals, so that probably says something. It's an alfresco series of hawker stalls, and for the tourists in a convenient location not far from many central Singapore attractions. The food options all looked good, but we settled on the first stall that did Singapore chilli crab ... it was soooo good! My wife doesn't have a particular palate for seafood nor stomach for chilli, but she couldn't get enough. We paid $38 for a medium sized crab, plus we also ordered some extra side dishes. Speaking to the table next to us, they were saying the chilli crab is as good here as at pricier restaurants in Singapore. We later tried a stall on the opposite end for dessert and really enjoyed that too. Tourist Tip #1: get there early, the tables filled up really quickly around dinner time. Tourist Tip #2: bring your own napkins, especially if you're eating something messy like chilli crab
5
My boyfriend and I were bringing around my cousin who grew up in the US, and my cousin wanted to eat authentic Singaporean food so we brought him here, though it was also our first time.Food was absolutely wonderful for the price. The most expensive dish we bought was chili crabs for S50 for an entire plate which probably weighed 1 kg. It was good for at least 4 people and we were only 3 so obviously we brought home the leftovers.Be wary that the seating area is limited so be prepared to wait a while until you find a vacant table. Lines are pretty long too during meal times.Definitely a place to go to for a Singaporean gastronomical feast! :-
5
The food selection was fantastic. Cheap and locality was great, Hard to find a seat as is very popular with tourists and locals.
4
Will go back for char kway teow and pad thai.
+Vegetarian friendly
+Nice views
A little difficult to find seats though as it gets crowded really easily.
Traveled last February 2012.
4
Great quick food with lots of choice. Very cheap and easy but very popular so can be hard to find a seat!
4
It is what it is and it is very good!
Lots of choice of high quality, hygienic, typical Singaporean fare.
Difficult to find a place to sit down during early to late evening hours.
Nice, vibrant joint with quick efficient service.
4
This was a good location with lots of variety for street foods. Numerous satays, stingray grills, The johnny sandwhich is worth a try although its a lot. Best time to so is after 7pm.
5
This is exactly what we were looking for. Sitting among fellow travellers to get a taste of local food. Well worth a visit and cheap.

We knew this wasn't the best hawker center in Singapore, but it's a good place to stop and get some good hawker style local food while visiting the waterfront in Esplanade. During evenings though, it can get crowded and hard to get a table. So come a little earlier if you can and get a table nearer to the waterfront and get a great view of the bay and the Marina Bay Sands and Singapore Flyer while having dinner. Be prepared to share a table, it's perfectly normal here.The seafood stall at the very end nearer to the bay is recommended. They serve good quality seafood and properly cooked. Try the chili crab, and the garlic steamed prawns. They've also got stingray which was very tasty and tender.Try the hainanese chicken, carrot cake, and the chicken wings too. If you like noodles, the mee goreng is good too.There's even a Filipino food place here (Gerry's Grill), which I felt was out of place, despite me being from the Philippines. I guess it does fall under hawker style food but not local.Overall, this hawker stall provides a bit of everything although you will not have a choice of stalls. Each stall serves something different. If you want chicken wings, then it's just one stall that sells that, unlike in other larger hawker centres around the city. Some people call it introduction to hawker style eating, so may be more for first timers, or for those who want some hawker style food while being in the waterfront area.The system here is a bit different than other hawker centres. You order, you pay, and you go back after a few minutes to pick your food up. They don't bring it to your tables.The stall owners here are a bit more friendly than other local hawker centres, that's just because they're used to foreigners here, which plays for majority of the customers here.Price is a bit more upscale than other hawker centres, definitely, like anywhere else, you have to pay the price for being located in an upscale area too.I think the best part of eating here is that you get to relax and walk along the waterfront and enjoy the evening views while burning off the food that you've just eaten ;-
4
Hawkers market with a view over the sea, great venue to watch the nightly laser show at 9.30pm. A good selection of food stalls offering great value for money. Enjoyed a plate of mixed satays - chicken, prawn & beef and then a superb murtabak (thin pancake filled and fried on griddle) probably the best we have ever eaten. Great atmosphere and good value
3
If you want to try local dishes, you can do so easily at any food courts in any shopping malls. Gluttonsbay is probably more for tourists. There are different stalls that sell a variety of food. Generally, it's just local dishes which you can't go wrong with. Nothing really surprising and awesome for locals really. We sorta eat this everywhere and everyday and there are wayyy better stalls out there. All swamped with tourists at 630pm on a Thursday night. Be sure to go early. Only one stall for each item so it's almost like monopoly. For those who are around the vicinity and prefer to do alfresco instead of being in a mall, you can give it a try. Not really recommended for locals. Order, pay and they give u a tag/receipt. Go back in about 5 mins to collect food. Dishes left out in open air while waiting to be picked up so things can get cold easily. Don't worry about food poisoning
4
Singapore is known for it's popular street food. Hawker's centres have been set up all over the city. Makansutra, Glutton's Bay is one of Singapore's more recent hawker's centres.It is located near the Esplanade Theatre. There are about a dozen stalls selected from popular street stalls elsewhere in the city.I've been there twice. The Sambal Stingray was very good the first time, ok the next time. The Singapore Chilli Crab was good but not as good as some I've had at other places.The location is good with a view of the Marina and Marina Bay Sands. There is a bus stop just there on the main road with good connectivity to a lot of places
4
Yes it’s touristy, yes it might not be the cheapest or the very best, but I love it. Accessible, meeting other tourists, nice view, good food, I like it.
4
As this was our first trip to Asia, Gluttons bay gave us the perfect introduction to street food. The stalls have the food available in pictures and written in English for the most part. We ordered plenty of delicious food but our favourite was the prawn and chicken satay. The peanut sauce was so tasty and the lady who served us was super friendly. If you are wary of trying street food I think the Gluttons bay provides the perfect introduction. Enjoy
3
We ate here twice as it was close to our hotel. The first time was a Thursday night and it was easy to get a table, the second time was a Saturday night and it is much busier - be prepared to wait for a table and/or ask to share. We scoped out other Australians and then shared a table!The majority of people dining here do seem to be tourists, like many other reviewers have said, so is it the best/cheapest hawker food centre probably not but we had a pleasant experience both nights.Across the 2 nights we had:- Haianese chicken, roast (both nights for our son!). The 2nd night was much better than first, not just the chicken but the flavour of the rice as well.- vegetarian spring rolls. Again both nights and delicious on both occasions.- cereal prawns. Very tasty and a large serving (8 big prawns). Unsuspecting visitors beware, this is Asia, the prawns are cooked whole (heads and shells on)- chilli crab. There are 2 places offering this and we chose the fixed price stall - 2 crabs for $50. The flavours were good and an adequate meal for 2 people supplemented with a serve of spring rolls.- beef and chicken satay. This was the worst dish, very dry and not much flavour. Even with the chilli crab, this was by far the cheapest main meals we had in Singapore and if you are lucky enough to get a table at the far end the view is spectacular.Remember to bring your own napkins/tissues and don't be shy about asking to share a table
4
My friends in SG treated us here. Best street food where every dishes in other countries you can find here. We had chili crab, stingray and other yummy food. It has a long queue during weekends. But when it rained there were not enough umbrellas to stay dry
5
This is the best street food in the world. The setting by the bay is breath taking. The street has about twenty regional fast food stalls serving authentic food you would search months for in the UK. Tables are hard to find early evening, so it may be better wait until later in the evening to eat. Typical main course costs around Â£5! Fill your boots..
5
Me and my girlfriend went here because of the unbelievably slow service at Seafood Paradise. We were looking at the menu for about 10 mins with no assistance! Turned out, good thing we left! We found this cozy place by riding a bus from the station just outside of the SG flyer. We immediately noticed the chili crabs on display, we asked the guy and he offered a million things i couldn't understand so i pointed on yang chow, chili crabs and deep fried buttered shrimps! and the damage? 56 SGD... Very reasonable for the feast we had! I would strongly recommend this place for couples on a budget. the resto name was Hong Kong Street old chun ke
4
Went to Makansutra 2 nights in a row, it's hawker style food so grab a table, leave a pack of paper tissues to mark it and go get food.A bit harder as a solo traveller but can be done if you either arrive early or share...I had the satay and Chicken rice, both very good. Sadly I didn't have enough time to check other offerings
4
I love food, unfortunately I can't tolerate milk (lactose intolerance) and can't eat spicy food (irritable bowel syndrome). So you can imagine my frustration when almost all the places I went to served spicy food. And I was also on tight budget in a very expensive city.Went here on my second night in Singapore and instantly fell in love with the food. It's close to what we have in the Philippines, and affordable too. So if you're a Filipino, and around the Esplanade area at night, and too far away from Orchard (where Jollibee is), I suggest you check this place out. One serving of rice (the cheapest is 4SGD) is good for two people actually, even if they tell you it's good for one only. There's seafood, chicken, and pork kebabs here. Went there for the next two nights after our convention in Suntec Convention Center, it's only about three or four blocks away, walkable.Esplanade is nearby, you can walk along the bay (wonderful view at night) and watch a concert along the bay (free), and walk a little further across the bridge to the Merlion (there's also the occasional light show or fireworks). The City Hall MRT station is a few minutes walk from hereon
1
After the sublime murtabak at Zam Zams, the exquisite Tian Tian chicken rice and other delicacies at Maxwell Food Centre, as well as lots of other fabulous food in Singapore, we came here on the last night of our holiday and it was rotten.The nasi goring was just wrong - too much belacan. The coconut wasn't fresh. Dirty fat had been used to cook the spring rolls and ayam goreng. The satay tasted ever so slightly of petrol. The only stall that wasn't disgusting was the chicken rice - and that was just OK.Avoid like the plague because you might just catch it here..
2
I love Singapore for its food, more than any other city in the world, on my trips to Singapore I generally spend the entire trip eating in hawker centers and in this time I have never had a bad meal...that was until our party went to Gluttons Bay! It just seems like a hyped up westernized hawker center for people who prefer food on the bland side. We had 3 different dishes from 3 different stalls and all were very ordinary, this is very much contrary to the Singapore hawker cuisine I know and love. Not terrible, just not good.Nice location, sure, but I'd rather sacrifice view for flavor and for that reason I can't recommend it
4
The plus point of this is the location and the fact that no stall serves bad or mediocre food. Everything is good & above. Personally, I have my own favourite hawker centers for individual dishes, but this remains the place I take overseas visitors for their sampling of local fare. Negative is the crowd on weekends which makes getting place a headache. But that does not stop the place being patronized by both tourists as well as locals
4
like the maxwell road hawkers this one is got an upbit feeling as you have a nice views of the marina bay sands and other sights...its not covered but they have huge umbrella to protect you either from the sun or rain.had a brill time eating and there is also a stall that sells filipino foods if you fancy trying it...
4
If you love food, you should definitely check out Makansutra Glutton's Bay the next time you visit Singapore. At first glance, you'd already see how well-loved the area is: lots of people having fun, the aroma of different kinds of food, and the general vibe of the place. While it might be hard to find a table at first, your patience will easily be rewarded once your food arrives. The place is a good spot to go to after a day of touring the city. Afterwards, you can enjoy the sights and sounds in the Esplanade since it's just nearby.Try the fried baby squid, the chicken and beef satay, and their sugar cane drink
4
We were very hungry after losing ourselves in the city on our first day. We decided to eat in Makansutra because it was the only place open after lunch. They had Indonesian, Malay, HK Chinese, Taiwanese, Filipino, Singaporean cuisines. We were excited to try all but settled for sting ray with sambal which was excellent, cereal prawns which was double the excellence of the sting ray, spring rolls, chicken satay some pineapple fried rice and vegetables. We really ordered for 5 people, I think but gladly helped ourselves to the site of the delicious feast. The toilets were not so good so do use the one inside Esplanade mall. The heat might make it not ideal for some to dine during the day. It wasn't exceptionally clean as it was a hawker's style of food cluster. But worth it if you're far from Newton and staying in the area. Food was fast, cheap and good. Don't expect restaurant type service though. We had to arrange our own tables and chairs and they wouldn't turn on the fans coz apparently it was "off peak

The Roti Prata and Kway Teow were amazing. My favorite place that we ate in Singapore (short trip). If you have a chance I would highly recommend it. We got there at 5 and it was just opening to customers so check the times it is open before you go. Also a little hard to find even with google maps
4
Singapore does Hawkers Centers like few places in the world. Great food that is inexpensive. This one is a little more special, as it has both great food and a great location. A must if you want a little more from your evening and still not hurt the budge
5
If you want to try local street food but the stalls and hygiene scares GO HERE. The stalls are clean and inspected. The food is delicious with many stalls to choose from. My favourite is the Chilli Stingray. We have eaten here many times and its always good. Also a great location with views of MBS
5
When visiting countries, I prefer to eat as much local cuisine and from local restaurants as I possibly can. Last year I ate at Lau Pa Sat almost every day and this year, it was Makan Sutra. The experience is very different too. MS is a lot smaller than LPS and foo choices are not as varied. But the experience is well worth it. I went alone and sat amongst strangers who were happy to share their tables. I would recommend you go with somebody, get a table first and order in turn. The chilli crab from the first stall is a must, as is the satay (not from the same stall)
4
We were here for the F1 races, we were in grandstand 3 just a 2min walk if that away.It was understandably busy during dinner time however we would pop in after the end of each race over the 3 nights and there were no line ups and plenty of seats. So much easier to grab a bit of everything. The beef flat rice noodles, and satay chicken skewers were my favourite.I wanted to try chilli crab but it was a bit more expensive than i expected.About S$30?Other than that a lot to choose from and couple nights we chose to take away and eat by the water

This place is very crowded fronting the Marina Bay in a spectacular view. Servings are in medium to small size depending on the menu and look deliciously mouth-watering but some are only on the presentation that counts. The Chinese Kangkong (ipomea leaves similar to spinach) looks yummy simply because of too much oil for it to look it fresh and has garlic on top to look yummy, but the taste is disappointing. The food is more of Indonesian spices and taste. A lot of msg as well in some of Chinese food. Szechuan shrimp taste good. If you are coming here as a group, good luck in finding a spot that will fit your group, this open dining with different vendors are really crowded. Your clothes will smell like a food being served from other table esp. sizzling. Smokers are all around as well. This place is not for a group who wants to stay for more than an hour since a lot of people dine in here. We have waited for more than 30mins. to find seats perfect for our group

Loved the grilled foods! Also the oyster omelet, hokkien mi, ice kachang. Very crowded most of the time. Go there in the early afternoon.
3
one of the hawker food area i loved( its a bit narrow unlike other hawkers area).....a mixture of malay ,chinese, indo, indian cuisine ... name it you'll get it here.... better to dine at night.... bloody beautiful food really.. a must dash...
1
Terrible. The food is overpriced and wasn't cooked well. The cereal prawns didn't have enough cereal, the oyster omelette was bad and worst of all was the stingray, which had a foul smell. It was uncooked and probably already starting to rot. Don't go there.
4
You will find this place always packed so better reserve a seat before you grab your food.
This place offers the variety of food to enjoy specially seafood.
3
only a few food vendors in makansutra, and they open at 5 pm in the afternoon..
try nasi goreng tom yam there..i have to give it a "fair" rate..

Having read countless glowing reviews for Makansutra Gluttons Bay, we decided to see what all the fuss was about. We were absolutely delighted that it exceeded our expectations and can’t wait to go back again.After catching the MRT to Bayfront, we took in the magnificent city skyline views at Marina Bay Sands Boardwalk before heading towards the Helix Bridge and strolling across to Makansutra. It’s an easy walk with spectacular scenery and a much better alternative to arriving via Esplanade MRT or Raffles Avenue. It may be too hot to be an enjoyable walk during the day, but at nighttime it’s lovely, balmy and breezy. Makansutra is well lit and signed, but before it comes into view, you’ll probably hear the raucous laughter and chatter of hoards of happy diners. The open-air seating area is perfect for a warm Singapore evening and the wonderful views of Marina Bay Sands and the city skyline are magnificent.There’s a good selection of dishes that represent a fair share of the ethnic culinary scene in Singapore. With such tempting fare it’s best to pick a few dishes from different stalls to share. We had chicken rice ($4.60), pork belly ($9.60, + 85 cents to add rice) and roti prata with chicken curry ($4). All were absolutely delicious and had us wishing we hadn’t eaten breakfast or lunch that day so we could go back for seconds and thirds. Although in some cases more expensive than the suburban hawker centers, the view, atmosphere, and quality of the food more than make up for this. Also, it’s a great introduction to hawker centres for non-Singaporeans as the relaxed service style is less intimidating than traditional hawkers centers, which can be too frantic, fast paced and confusing for a curious traveler who can’t decide what to order. Despite being packed with tourists and locals alike, we didn’t feel crowded or rushed through our meal. We could sit back and enjoy our food and conversation at our own pace. After dinner, we wandered along the waterfront and through the city to City Hall MRT. Alternatively, for a more scenic route, you could continue down the river to Clarke Quay or simply roll into a taxi at the Esplanade taxi stand next door. An excellent way to taste of sampling of what Singapore street food has to offer while getting a nice hit of night time sightseeing

Glutton's Bay offers cheap food with an expensive view.Get a table down by the water for views of Marina Bay Sands and the CBD. The air that sweeps up off the bay provides a cool relief from the hot weather. The food is good, but compared to other Hawker Centres, it is more expensive, with less variety overall but more seafood
1
we live for 1 yr in singapore now and after work decided to eat here. We heard that stalls are selected to have a stall at the makan sutra, so we had high expectations.the food was really over priced, more than double compared to a "normal"hawker. which is acceptable considering these are supposingly good food stalls and ofcourse the location.we ordered gado gado, soto ayam and green curry, all three dishes did not come close to what it should be.My advice, please try the hawker stalls in the areas that are not touristic, for example the hawker at little India ( still a bit touristic) has excellent food, for fair prices, There you will really have a taste of Asia
4
This is a good hawker centre right in down town, in the Esplanade right in front of the Marina Mandarin hotel. The advantage is no need to venture to other hawkers like Newton or Maxwell, and just walk right over if you are in downtown. The disadvantage is it is smaller, and maybe tough to find seating (unless you go later)
4
If you want the cheaper hawkwer? This is the place to be, The Makan Sutra at Glutton's Bay, One of my favorite there is The Oyster Omellette, Spring rolls and Fried Rice... its very delicious. This hawkwer is a quite crowded because too many customers eat there, so its very hard to find the table. But the problem there in the rainy season, some open tables had no protection / or roof for the customers while eating there, altough, some of the tables had a roof cover like an umbrella type.. so maybe need to provide that to the open table for the customers eat comfortly..
4
my current fav place in singapore for hawker food!
prices may be slightly steep (considering the type of food available) but the quality is good and the waters make for a beautiful view.
get the carrot cake!
4
Great location in Marina Bay area. Small compared to Newton Circus, and it lacks the hawker ambience that Newton offers. But the food is just as good. Good alternative to Newton.
5
It's all about the food so you eat with your hands and create a mess... Overpriced though so don't think it's another hawker place
4
Arrived in Singapore yesterday and had dinner here just satay and tiger beer with some chicken rice and Kai lan heaven. Street food ticks all the boxes always.
4
If there is no threat of rain (open air eating) Makansutra Glutton's Bay is a great place to grab a cheap meal and enjoy the views over the water to the Marina Bay Sands Hotel.Plenty of choice, especially for lovers of seafood, but it can be hard to get a table at this super popular eating spot. We got our food takeway and sat down by the water
4
Stopped here for dessert after a late night trip on the Singapore Flyer. The main restaurants in the nearby mall were winding down for the night but the hawker stalls in Glutton's Bay were still busy. We had banana tempura and a 'fondue' dish at 'The Sweet Spot' stall. Both are served with kaya syrup which makes them the perfect fix if you have a craving for something sweet
5
been there twice. always eat the same menu for dinner. Chili Crab. 1 portion for three, and we add rice plus plum juice. we get affordable price (S$ 50 for three). the place quite crowded, we have to wait the table, but it still acceptable and comfort
5
My family and I were told of Makansutra by the driver who took us from the airport, when my mother-in-law said she was keen to have some satay. On our second night in Singapore (a Sunday night) around 7pm, we walked from our hotel nearby and found this place that was busy but we thankfully found a table straight away, as that is the trickiest part. I have 2 young kids who do not like hot food but were willing to try new things and with them and my husband we chose a few different dishes - pineapple fried rice and lemon chicken from one stall and mutton murtebak (the large size was huge!) and satay from another stall and these dishes were very tasty and all was eaten by the kids. My in-laws enjoyed their satay with the nasi goreng nice but on the spicy side. The best part about this place is the lovely outdoor setting after a hot day, it was so pleasant to sit outside in the cool rather than in airconditioned food halls and the atmosphere was lovely and a great view across Marina Bay. Makansutra is more of a classier type of hawker centre as it is very clean and on all the cups it was labelled with Makansutra but otherwise the food was no more expensive than other places we ate (a dish cost around S$6 which was half the price you would pay in Australia!) and the atmosphere was completely worth it. Heaps of choices too and lovely fresh juices - my husband loved the sugarcane juice! A worthwhile experience and unfortunately we didn't make it back because our boys were so tired after many days of walking but very glad we made it that night. Go early to get a table although you can take your food down to the water
2
Makan Sutra is always crowded and attracts lots of tourists. Food is therefore much more expensive than it should be and taste does not live up to prices. I tried their grilled chicken, stingray, satay sets and carrot cake. Food is alright, but not memorable. Having been there a couple of times, I witnessed that some food sellers are way more friendly and polite when it comes to serving Western tourists. Makan Sutra's location is great, since we can see Marina Bay Sands and the Fullerton Hotel, but that's all I can say on the positive side
5
there are loads of stalls to choose your meal from...had a gareng noodle dish and carrot cake...all sorts of ethnic foods from filipino to indonesian to indian...tried the durian shaved ice dessert...just yummy....blown away by a drink called tiger tower...you have to see it to believe it...next time chili crab..
4
Great al fresco communal dining among local folk in Singapore. All types of singaporean, malaysian and chinese dishes to be had at popular prices. Then there are great dessert places right beside it at the Esplanade.
5
Lived up to its name! Great food, great location and great atmosphere! Anyone visiting Singapore, this place is a MUST see!
5
If you like local food or want to try it out, this place is a must visit for tourists and locals alike. Recently renovated with al-fresco dining, the hawker food selection here is worth every cent. I always try to take every visitor that I have in town to Makansutra for the food and the ambience. The view while having the best of local food and beer is picture perfect. I have not had a single dish here that I would term as average and am a big time foodie and a fan of local hawker food. The dishes are reasonably priced and you know you are paying the right price unlike some tourist traps on the island
4
Impressive selection of food stalls in a small area near the Esplanade & the Marina Bay. It doesn't have the genuine atmosphere & feel of the place of other Hawker Centres, however I'm glad we went there on out first evening as it was a great intro to the style, with very good food and reasonable prices, although cheaper is obviously available elsewhere
3
There is hawker style food at Makansutra. Reasonable and a wide variety. I chose the Nasi Goreng and it was not great, was nothing compared to the usual nasi goreng from Mamak in Australia. i don't recall the name of the stall but it was a few stalls from the drinks stall. I have to say the carrot cake in sweet sauce was really yummy. Its also a few stalls from the drinks stall. Just a warning when you order drinks in Singapore they tend to put a lot of ice and when you request less ice they charge you extra
4
Rated by KF Seetoh as Singapores best hawker center, so we went . I like the atmosphere here than any other center. Food is pretty good but more expensive than other centers. Yet I seemed to get sick on any of the local fare. Once visitors get the swing of finding a seat (waiting for other to leave) then ordering food it becomes less daunting. I suggest visiting later at night after 11PM when it's less busy. Forget the kaya toast, not very god at all. The satay was decent, ask for boneless chicken rice. Chili crab is worth the price. Lime juice is always the best drink if fresh
4
Everything that one might want to taste of Singapore's cuisine is here: carrot cake, chicken rice, sambal sting ray and of course, chilli crabs.We were there at around 7PM on a weeknight so there were lots of tables still available. Make sure you have a tissue pack with you which serves dual purpose: 1) you leave the tissue pack on the table to reserve the table for you and 2) wipe the chilli crab sauce from your hands (the stalls do not provide free tissue to diners).We tried the chilli crab with fried mantou, chicken rice and sugarcane juice. I initially planned for us to dine at Jumbo or at No Reservations but I figured that Makansutra will give us more variety and value for money. TIP: Be there early to increase your chances of getting an available table especially if you're a big group. Stay until 8PM to catch the Marina Bay Sands light show
4
We went there in the evening as the other reviewers said it is crowded and we had to wait for a table. We had seafood fried rice and juice it is really tasty little pricey comparing the scenary it is not expensive. If you around marin

Makansutra Glutton's Bay one of the famous Hawker in SIngapore.Quite pricey compare to other hawkers but the view is great. Overlooking MBS.

Makansutra at Glutton's Bay according to me is one of the best places to enjoy seafood dinner with family. Been here twice and had a wonderful experience. The view of the bay and the breeze sets in the mood to indulge in the steamy smoky delicacies served. Only turn off to this place is its popularity which brings in a lot of crowd especially at weekends. At times one has to wait for a long time to get a table, but once the food arrives, its all worth
4
within three nights in singapore, I dined at this place; my favorite menu is Chili crab; nice place but you have to be patient to take a table
5
It was a joy eating by the bay. There are numerous choice of delectable food. The view around was so appetizing, I would go back there and try other asian food.
5
Great food and atmosphere. Highly recommend the Satay place. The view around on the harbour is also most amazing.
Don't miss this Singaporean food experience.
5
Brilliant selection.stall holders even adapt dishes to suit vegetarians which is great. Very cheap for food and alcohol.go early and then watch laser show on river after. It's a great venue.
4
Its a pool of hawker typed in a more organized venue. Self-serviced. One can get most of the local food here for a reasonable price and most of it are my favourite dishes, and like the name speak for itself a Glutton Bay for the glutton
5
A great place for cheap, fresh food. We really enjoyed wandering around looking at all of the delicious dishes before choosing. It is a bit tricky finding a seat but we shared a table with a couple of exchange students who were keen for us to try some of their dishes as well! We found this a noisy, fun place .. street eating but in a courtyard .. and we timed it well for the light and sound show afterwards
3
What do you think when you're seeing the crowd? Yes, you have to come and join. It was happened to me at Makansutra. The crowd in that narrows space really spoiled my curiousity. I and my family didnt get any tables to sit and I have to wait about 15 mins for my food order to be ready. I had to bring the food to the river pedestarian near the place and eat there.They have some many choices on asian food. I am not a culinary reviewer and dont have good passion with food. But they have Indonsian satay with nut sauces tasted like a curry. I didnt expect too muc

Makansutra Glutton’s Bay is a Singapore food institution with a feast of South East Asian creations on offer from Hong Kong dim sum to Thai stir-fries. I spotted the cart with the longest line and joined in going with the ‘majority rules’ way of thinking so BBQ chicken wings and white style ‘carrot cake’ it was. So cheap too, my huge wings were $1.40SNG each and the strange dish called carrot cake (but no cream cheese frosting in sight) just $4 SNG. I loved it and the Sweet Spot for desert was great, shaved iced milk and sweet fruit jellies.I have a written a long review of this experience with a heap of pics on my blog if anyone wants more info. http://areyouchasingamy.com/2013/05/01/salivating-in-singapore

This place is busy so not easy to get a table near the fans, but I recommend you do if you can. Great atmosphere and location but food better in millenia walk food hall (maybe becuase it was air conditioned there I could enjoy it more
3
Going twice in one week gave me the chance to try the char kway teow, sugar cane drink, mee goreng and ice kachang. The main advantage of this food place is its location, conveniently situated next to the Esplanade Mall (for concert-goers) and its outdoor atmosphere when the weather's cooler. Char kway teow was ordinary as I've tasted better in the suburban hawker centres. The mee goreng was tasty while the ice-kachang (non-durian version) had an interesting touch with its creamy corn topping - not bad even for someone who doesn't like corn. Prices are on the higher side compared with some food courts and definitely the hawker centres - expected because of the location and tourist draw this place is
4
Makansutra Glutton's bay takes the hawker's food court concept to another level. the place is neat and clean and serves and serves all the famous delicacies of Singapore. It also offers a good view of the marina bay and the Singapore CBD area.
4
After strolling around the Esplanade and you find the restaurants their expensive, head on to Makansutra Gluttony Bay. Here, you'll be able enjoy Singaporean hawker favorites with a fantastic view of the Merlion.We went there for dinner, and found the place full of people. After browsing through the offerings and even seeing a Filipino grilled pork belly stall, I decided to get a grilled stingray and compare it to the one I ate a few days ago at Albert Food Court in Bugis. After one bite, the stingray was excellent, tender, moist, with the right sambal flavoring to make it addictive. Obviously, this place is for tourists or for those with guests visiting from another country. Sort of like Hawker 101 or Cliff Notes to Singaporean Hawker Food. Supposed to be, the tenants of the hawker stalls are curated and selected for being the best representative of the dish they're offering but price point differences aside, this is a trip worth making. But don't forget to eat at the more established hawker centers like Lau Pau Sat, Maxwell or Newton, to get a full understanding of Singaporean hawker foodie culture
3
We went there a few days ago as we read some of the best hawkers were located here. The place, right behind the Esplanade, is very nice. The view at the end of it is great as you can see all of the Singapore Central Business District (CBD) and the Marina Bay. Really, probably one of the best views you can get. Walking around there is also beautiful.As for food, our expectations were high. Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice was just average. We found others in town (in proper hawker centres) that have been better. We also had a Chicken Roti at Old Satay Club Mee Goreng, and this was a little bit better. For dessert, the tempura bananas were very nice.Prices were a dollar or two more than in a comparable hawker centre (chicken rice: about 6 SGD, large chicken roti: 12 SGD).We went around 7.30 on a thursday, so did not run into any of the issues other people seem to have encountered (stalls running out of food).All in all, the place is OK. Definitely worth a visit when around the area, but I dont believe this is the best hawker food you can get
4
If you happened to be around Marina Area and want to get decent dinner with decent price this is the place. Located in Esplanade Area, the view from this food court is excellent at night. You can see the monstrous Marina Bay Sands Hotel. After dinner you can hang around by just taking a stroll around the area or you can sit by the open theater if there's a performance there.It's a little bit hard to get empty tables/spots though during the dinner rush hour (18:00-19:00), if your party only consists of 2 people you may need to adjust sit together with somebody else
5
We were staying in Swissotel The Stamford and within walking distance.This hawkers centre had come highly recommended, and boy was it good.It was so good we came here two of our three nights in Singapore.Approx ten stalls all cooking and selling their wares.It is a great experience and well worth a visit.The seafood, especially the chilli crab is exceptional and at a fraction of the price to pay in a restaurant.Why can't we have these everywhere...
5
Great open-air dining place . The choice of yummy asian food was a delight esp the Malaysian and Filipino food ;D . It is not your typical hawker center and i love the view of the merlion park ( from afar) . I dont like the choice of drinks there though . But overall , i love the food trip experience there esp if you will enjoy it with friends ;
5
if you love foods, this is a must visit in Singapore....tens of food stalls offer you different good foods and drinks...must try : chicken wings, satai / sate, chilli crab and the lemonade drinks..it's not the cheapest food stalls but it surely makes your tummy very happy..

I first ate at Glutton's Bay a couple of years ago (told it was "newly opened") and was rather impressed by the experience of dining in the open air/under the stars. The food was good, but as it was during the busy Chinese new year period, there was the Chingay evening parade of "floats" on the parade route within a few meters, meaning crowds of people milling about and long wait for service, etc, so I was not able to make a tour of various stalls/kitchens serving the foods. Yesterday, however, I re-visited the foodstalls and am very impressed by what I saw:1) This eating oasis is located next to the "Durians" - the theatres by the bay- in Esplanade, and easily reached by MRT, buses, or walking (if you are staying at hotels in the Raffles City and Raffles Hotel area) There are at most a dozen foodstalls (with kitchen behind serving counter) located in a rectangular open area, with views of the bay, Marina Bay Sands, and across the waters to Collyer Quay/Fullerton bay areas. Nearby are other food outlets, mostly in-door or air-con'd ones.2) These stalls were selected (by the Organisers) based on the type of local dishes they are locally known for, meaning no 2 stalls serve the same local foods. Thus, the tourist as well as Singaporeans get to sample popular / famous local foods that the stalls are known to produce. The food - depending on how the dishes should be prepared - are mostly cooked upon order, so are cooked to your order ( example: less spicy/spicy/more spicy, no garlic/with garlic, etc.)3) There are photos of the dishes and their prices, displayed for you to make your selection, You can further discuss with the staff how you wish to adjust your order to your liking. You are usually given an identifier for your order - if it is a main course (as in my case, a chillie crab dish) - then you choose a table and wait for your food to be served/delivered. For simple orders like simple stir fries/drinks/desserts - self-service applies.4) There are 2 kinds of seating arrangements - either round tables and chairs under an umbrella cover, or long "picnic-type" tables and (back-less) benches for big groups / families.5) Price-quality: the prices are a bit higher than when eating at "food-courts"/stalls in various places on the island, perhaps a SGD 1 more or so, but one pays for locally-sourced and freshly cooked food in relatively clean kitchens, eating in the open air, casual atmosphere with a view of the bay right in front of you.I was determined to sample the chillie crab dish (reviewed 2 days ago in the local newspaper) and cooked by a locally-popular established restaurant which earned the right to have a stall at Glutton's bay. And I did. I was very impressed by this dish - the taste and the ingredients/ spices used is authentic. I only wished they had the Sirilanka crabs - bigger with more flesh - in stock, but guessed this is not the season for it. My one whole crab (with ample flesh) cooked in spicy tomato-based sauce costs SGD 25= and I ordered a plate of fried rice to "soak up" the mouth-watering sauce. Highly recommend this dish to those familiar with "Singapore Chillie Crab".I noticed that fried noodle dishes for example, are priced based on small/medium/large plate. A SGD4 or 6 dish of fried rice or noodle would be sufficient for me.Next time I shall sample other available local dishes like oyster omlette, fried noodles - choice of white flat, or yellow spagetti-like but fresh, or dried thin variety, and many others like satay (chicken/beef) served with yummy peanut sauce. Each stall specialises in its own local dishes, including local desserts . If you are not sure what each dish is made up of, be bold, ask the staff, and they will take time to answer your questions.I thank the committee/local organisation for their efforts and time invested in making Glutton's Bay an affordable (better priced than eating in air-conditioned restaurants) and authentic eating experience for both locals and visitors to your food-paradise island

We went to Makansutra on a Saturday night at around 7pm - its very busy and we needed to loitre to score ourselves a table for 4. We went with friends who ordered all the food for us (and said that all the nicest Hawker Stall's from around Singapore end up in Gluttons Bay. We had pineapple rice, carrot cake (not actually cake), cereal prawns (subsequently had much nicer prawns elsewhere), chicken wings, satay sticks and fresh coconut water. It was all fantastic.You are overlooking Marina Bay Sands and the waterfront - so after dinner we were able to see the light/sound show (at 8pm), walk over the spiral bridge and into Marina Sands. I probably would have found this stressful had I not had someone there to navigate the tables and menus - but thats the experience - and it was awesome
2
My cousin and I ate at Makansutra at Gluttons Bay one night....and I will say that it was rather disappointing. Not being a stranger to Singapore (but still not having been to Makansutra beforehand), we were frustrated that while the options were varied, the food stalls ran out of food too quickly. We arrived a little before 10pm, and we couldn't even read the menu options before whoever was manning the satay stand blurted out that there was no more satay. How does the satay stall run out of satay over three hours before the food court closes? I could understand running out maybe 30 minutes before closing or something, but not three whole hours. And that happened with a few other stalls as well. Ultimately, more options we wanted were unavailable than those that were available. That just smacks of food service mismanagement, unfortunately.We left by 1045, after being frustrated that not only was the satay gone, but so were the coconut drinks, as well as most of the desserts. Actually, everything was out from the dessert stall (like durian ice and banana tempura), and the only thing there was mediocre kaya toast. While the view on the water is very nice and the vibe is younger than at most food courts, I wouldn't recommend Makansutra in light of the myriad great food options in Singapore
5
Several types of food available for low budget travellers. Nice ambiance. A walk away from Singapore flyer, esplanade and merlion. You can watch the watershow from Marina Bay from there (not the perfect location but does the trick)
5
A lot of choice, just try as much as you can. Chicken rice and lemon juice not to be missed. Delicious chicken satay. Fabulous location on the Marina Promenade.
4
For a place owned by a celebrity food critic, he sure knows to choose the best there is in Singapore. Great food and ambience. And yes, can get crowded. The prices are a little higher than the usual food courts but guess since you get the best of the various options, why not. Service can get a lil iffy especially when they give you the stares to leave early and not loiter. Clean too, and you can soak in the awesome views. A must visit for a one-stop location for all types of great local hawker fare.
4
Pro's:+ Great location. It's a short walk from the Esplanade. This is where you can go after a day of strolling in Marina Bay.+ It's outdoor dining. So --- fresh air, with view, and yeah, you can be wearing anything and not worry about it.+ Foods are affordable and there's plenty to choose from. You can try different asian cuisines at one go.Con's:- It's usually packed. So you have to search the whole area for a table. If you didn't see any, then go look for a group that's nearly finished and stay and wait them out. - This also means that you can't stay long. No enjoying the food or the place. There will be a lot of eyes on you if you so much as try. - Check the weather before going. But SG weather can be reallly predictable so if you're not sure, it's better to find somewhere else to eat
5
I liked the food served here. I mean there's so many choices to pick from it's hard to go wrong. I liked the Hokkien Prawn Mee, Cereal breaded shrimps/prawns, Gerry's Grill, kaya banana tempura, etc.It is right by the Esplanade Mall and you'll have a view of the bay and the Marina Bay Sands building. If you go right before sunset, you can get awesome photos.The only downside is that for dinner time, you need to make sure you get here earlier to be able to get a table (especially if you have a larger party). Otherwise, you'll be hunting around the area and kind of stalking people to see which table is almost finished eating so you can be the first one to grab it as soon as their party gets up from the table. :

An outdoor eating place with great view to Marina Bay Sands, Merlion Park and Singapore River! The atmosphere is joyful, as it's always crowded in the evening. A wide choice of food: from Chinese to Indian food, many drinks and deserts that are popular in Singapore! Price are fine, from 5-8 S$ for a typical dish and 2-3 S$ for drinks and deserts! Staffs are friendly! You can also eat out late at 11-12pm. On weekend you may enjoy some performances at the Esplanade Concert Hall nearby after dinner!My favorite place in Singapore

This is a great place to try the best hawker foods in Singapore. Its an outdoor eating area near the bay where you can enjoy great food with an even more beautiful scenery.There are many food stalls available and you just pick and choose. Within minutes, you've got your dishes. Quite enjoyed the singapore chilli crab cooked just the way I like. Most of the servings are very generous. Try and go there as soon as it opens up for dinner as the place becomes very busy, very quickly and you'll have to wait around for a table

Stalls are manned by rather friendly and customer oriented owners/staff.Most of the dishes are very tasty- others less (quite disappointed with the last stall closest to the bay (fish & seafood)...carrot cake and BBQ chicken wing and chicken rice stalls outstanding.By Swiss standards, the food is cheap, but by Singaporean, this is clearly a more 'premium' price point.The proximity to Marina Bay makes the additional price worth it in winter....(unless you like eating indoors ie air conditioned which is more adapted to warmer months).Was I blown away by the food? No. Is it a 'cheap' and cheerful way to discover part of Singapore's food culture? Absolutely.This is a particularly convenient place if you are a tourist- you can feel that this place is geared to the clueless tourist who has just gotten off the plane.Would probably return on my next visit
5
This is an open restaurant on the waterfront and you can enjoy great Singaporean food. There are many outlet serving various foods. Just pick and choose. More like a food court but with a difference. Try the chicken wings. They are awesome and huge. The fried rice and noodles are also great. You can enjoy a beer along with your meal. Try to go early as there is a rush always

Overlooking the bay with the Marina Bay Sands on one side and the city on the other, Glutton's Bay brings together some of the best hawker food in Singapore hand picked by Makansutra guide and the renowned KF Seetoh. There is nothing not to like about this place if you want to sample a variety of the best hawker food in Singapore and then wander down to the bay and take in the view
4
This is a little hawker center right on the Marina. Good solid choices but not as big as others. Within walking distance of shopping and the Flyer.
4
A few good stalls. I would bring my visitors there if they are around the MBS area. It's convenient. The food taste ok. Ambience not too bad. The chicken wing can be improved though.
5
I'm a little boring when it comes to picking food but I like anything with chicken so that's what I always ate.
4
You can choose singaporean food from satay, chicken rice and sea foods. My family favorite is grill chicken wings.....Crispy skin and tender meat. Yummy!
4
You really have to try the mee hokkian. It's spicy, delicious and reasonable price.Try also their Popiah. It's fresh.
4
We had arrived at Singapore late, staying nearby we drove past on our way to the hotel.
We walked in and enjoyed fresh juice, noodles, satay and chilli crab.
Great outdoor setting too!

Let's be straight up here- Glutton's Bay near the Marina district is a tourists version of a hawker centre, but for most people that's a good thing. You will pay more than the centre that most locals go to but it is undoubtedly cleaner than one in Geylang, Bedok or elsewhere in the city and you don't have to think twice about whether you'll feel quesy as a result of eating there. Another attraction is that Gluttons is very close to the Marina Mandarin, Marina Oriental, Pan pacific and just a short walk from the Swissotel Stamford.Try the chicken wings and satay- both very deliciou

We ate her a couple of times recently while in Singapore. We'd tried quite a few of the hawker areas and we found this to be the best. The stalls were simple and easy to understand, the food was amazing and cheap, but the best thing was the view. We could have eaten here every meal. Definitely worth at least one visit although I'm sure, like us, once won't be enough
4
Situated in the Esplanade complex, near Marina Bay, the Makan Sutra is made to look like a street-eating experience. There are a number of stalls serving various kinds of Thai, Chinese, Malay and other South-East Asian food. You buy food from each of the individual counters and sit on tables that are common to all. It's nice,because everyone can choose to eat what they want to, from a stall they prefer, and yet everyone is eating together. Cannot comment on prices, but I'm sure they are much more expensive than you would get from a regular street stall. However, there is a wide choice of food, and we enjoyed our dinner there
5
In addition to the view the fact that the place is open till wee hours in the night is a big plus. If you go there late in night you can get a table at the far end with the famous MBS as the backdrop. There is nothing much to write about the food per se it's similar to what one gets in countless food courts around the city with no specific famous stall. There is a Italian food stall which is not typical of a foodcourt, the choices there though are basic and the food is ok..
4
It was great fun to get out and act like a local, although you have to learn to fight for a table like a local otherwise you will be left standing. Food was great and super cheap. A lovely down to earth highlight
5
The place is really clean and they do stall selling most of the popular food in Singapore. The taste is good and the price is reasonable. Better to eat here than the Lau Pa Sat. After eating, you can walk to Esplanade.
4
Couple of rows of stalls selling all sorts of Asian food. Very popular with the locals and has lots of seating. We had chilli crab which was delicious. It was open late and easy access to taxis after.
4
Perfect location, atmosphere and food. I love their chili crab and stingray it's so delish but a bit costly. It's my 2nd time here and still going back.
2
You can get better quality Asian dishes elsewhere in the city, the only thing that's great about this place are the scenic views at night.

Singapore has great eats at all price- and sophistication-ranges. If you come as a tourist or business visitor, you should definitely try a hawker meal at one of the hawker centres.Glutton's Bay is a good overall choice. The location is very central, there are nice views, a good busy vibe, and all the stalls are good. Not great, but good; you won't go wrong in your choice. But there are tradeoffs:- It's a constructed and managed centre with a somewhat touristy vibe. It doesn't have the history or romanticism of Lau Pa Sat or Maxwell Road. But it's not too bad - you will see a cross-section of locals and visitors, it's certainly not a tourist trap.- if you know you want specific food X, chances are the best place for X is somewhere else. I'd say all the hawkers are top quartile in their category, but I'm not sure they're much better- it gets really crowded at peak time- a bit of a price premium- it is outside and not air conditioned. That's part of the experience - but be careful if you are not used to Singapore's humid hea

We visited this Hawker Centre on Sunday night as we wanted to visit another following our visit to Maxwell Road, it was opposite our hotel, plus we had read some good (and also mixed) reviews on TripAdvisor.Arrived at sunset and ordered our food from three different stalls – which created a bit of a logistical challenge getting it all back to a table whilst still warm.We choose mixed satay (deliciously spiced with accompanying spicy peanut sauce); deep-fried scallop rolls (amazingly light with delicate flavor); fried squid (perfect cooked); Chinese baby Choi Sum in oyster sauce (delicious); mixed fried rice (really good and hearty portion); and some lovely chili / garlic sauces as accompaniments. Overall we all really enjoyed the food, prices are somewhat higher than Maxwell Road, but compared to London still represents amazing value given quality of food (all in just under S$50 including a few cool beers). Service is pretty functional – but frankly given the prices that’s what you are paying for!The atmosphere was quite exciting as full of people trying different dishes and soaking up the last of the sun before the end of the day. Would definitely come back plus recommend as a good first introduction to Hawker centers for those [like us] who are new to the scene, or those who fancy a pre / post walk around Marina Bay

Good- location, price, experience (tourist perspective) and ability to taste a variety of dishes for a slightly modest amount in comparison to surrounding establishments. Average- Quality of products. Some better than others..chicken satay and sugarcane juice, opposed to the phad Thai. Bad- Attitude of some stall staff, and the sheer quantity of ice given with the juices...should be relabelled - Ice with a little sugarcane-lemon flavouring !!

I went with my family to Gluttons Bay and my parents sat on the table first but no one cleared the table until we called the cleaners. They were rude and were banging the utensils, throwing them into the pail like they are very unwilling to clear the tables. The gravy splashed on my mom's white pants, they did not even bother to apologize. After we ordered our food and we sat down to eat, the food was not very fantastic. Honestly while we were feeding on the food, tons of mosquitoes were feeding on us, having a blood party, it was a very unpleasant feeling! When we looked around, the only good thing about Gluttons Bay is the skyline. However, the whole place doesn't seems to match with Esplanade concept. Gluttons Bay looks dirty and sanitation seems to be very bad. The toilets were smelly and toilet paper were all around the toilets. The floors were wet and this posed a risk as customers may slip and fall and injure themselves. There was a very long queue at the drinks stall and I realized that because the servers were taking their own sweet time. After this experience, I do not think I will go back there again. Neither will I recommend anyone there
4
We went to eat at Makansutra Glutton's Bay to sample the Singaporean dishes and we were not disappointed. The chili crabs and prata were really good. Prices are fair. The only thing we can complain about is the lack of space to eat (or maybe there's just to much people). We had to wait and look for a table for about 30 mins
4
first time here, and spotted the stall with the longest queue. Trust me, it has the longest Queue for a reason! Black Pepper crab, stringray Bbq, Kailan and mussles/cockles?? was the best!
1
Considering that this place is recommended by Makan Sutra, I was anticipating at least some good food near Esplanade while enjoying good view. However, that was not the case. We had terrible experience with the food quality. Stalls owner should do a survey and conduct own food tasting. Having a Western food stall there is definitely out of place...Singapore should have more than this...singapore laksa, satay, and many more local delights
4
Our lone meal in a non-air-conditioned hawker center, and only because it had a full view of the Sands and seaview.You pay next to nothing for high quality food (hawkers here are selected for their quality and cleanliness), but the selection is deliberately designed to be limited. No 2 stalls serve the same food, so it's a substitute product competition going on here.Despite the gushing praise that Singaporeans and locals lavish on hawker food and how clean it is compared to other countries (amazing when you consider that there isn't a fly in sight despite SG's balmy all year weather), at the end of the day, the fact remains you are eating street prepared food cafeteria style in hard seats in 30 degree heat. If I had to choose, I'll take an indoor restaurant where I get waited on (albeit with far less tasty food) any day of the week
1
Have been wanting to try out and see what the hype is about. Disappointment for this case is understated. Not only the food were unsatisfactory, the service attitude was bad as well.I tried fried prawn noodles and my boyfriend had fried rice from the seafood stall. We also shared a plate of oyster omlette. Seriously, the taste ranked one of the lowest for hawker fare we've tried around Singapore. Boyfriend certainly wasn't impressed as well. We also ordered drinks from the first store and the staff/owner were pretty rude i would say. Perhaps because we are not tourist. We would not mind paying extra if the food quality is good, but sad to say, this place is nowhere near the mark.I glanced around and noticed majority were tourist and I feel ashamed and sorry for them that they have to try the substanded local fare. Or maybe they think it is good because it is their first time trying. But I would seriously suggest to bring your money else where and for that price you are paying, it is definitely not worth it. Singaporeans avoid, tourist beware. From makansutra, we were expecting something better. It was my first trip at gluttons bay, certainly my last
4
At least this is a place where you do not feel completely ripped off! If you manage to get there before it gets too busy (we went there before 6pm), you will enjoy very good and authentic food at more than reasonable prices ($22 for two). Do not expect anything fancy but this place seems popular with both locals, expats and tourists. We will definitely be back

Food Trip at Singapore = MakansutraStreet Foods at Singapore = MakansutraMakansutra is now one of the most visited places in Singapore.Why? Because of the many food choices and the nice street ambiance you’ll experience. Great place for bonding with friends, food tripping or just experiencing “Street Foods at Singapore.”Here are my top must-try:Chili Crab - This dish is famous for its very spicy and delicious sauce, mixed with the juicy and huge Crab. Plus the Mantou Bread that blends with the sauce so well.Chicken Wings - Grilled Chicken Wings is a favorite of all.Satay - Barbequed Meat such as Chicken, Lamb, or Goat with its special sauce. It all depends on your choice.Cereal Prawns - one of the must-taste dishes at MakansutraLemonade - instead of choosing drinks in can, why not try their locally-made drink? Makansutra’s lemonade is a refreshing drink for all the spicy foods served here

Recommended by concierge, when we wanted something easy and fun. Busy area, and it took about five minutes to grab a table. You'll do better if you are a group of three or more as you'll need someone to stay at the table whilst others go foraging for food and drink.There's loads of different stalls offering a wide variety of great sea food, satays, vege stuff and noodles. Most have a short queue before you can place your order, PAY CASH, and tell you anything between 3 and 7 minutes before you need to return and collect your food. Most dishes are really good value (eg tempura scallops), but a couple seemed pricey (eg garlic giant prawns). Four of us spent around S$150 including a couple of rounds of beers and really ate a lot more than we planned. But by ordering a few dishes, eating them and seeing what you fancy next, you can control what you spend to suit your appetite and budget.There are clean plates, napkins, utensils and wrapped packs of chopsticks. There are acceptable toilets too. Afterwards you can wander along the waterfront.We found it perfect, but do bring a wad of notes to pay for everything

This place is interesting for its outdoor setting at Marina Bay. If you get a seat at the outer most where you get the view to the bay, it's nice. But the food and drinks are just average, nothing special. The girl and the guy at the drink stall were unfriendly. The drink was below my expectations too. But I was surprised that the toilet is clean, provided with toilet rolls, sensors for automatic flushing, sanitary bins. Downside is there were no water to clean yourself up inside the toilet booths and the booths are very small
4
... went here a couple of nights back with friends...really enjoyed the place as we ate a lot ... a lot i tell youthe cereal prawns, the chicken, the calamares were to die for..plus the fact that they also offered dessert...anyway its basically an open area with chairs and tables.it can get packed at peak hours.the food price is cheap compared to other places plus the quality and taste is awesome..it is basically self service,,
4
Our friends finally took us to an outdoor hawker area - famous, I presume, as it was packed! We came on a friday night & seems like every1 had the same idea.Good friends + very casual & humid atmosphere + good food = FUN! There are numerous stalls to place orders on. You'll have to stand in-line w/ all the smoke in your face for an oder of tasty grilled food: CHICKEN/ PORK SATAY, SQUID, STING RAY (yes get that), and ask some1 else to order from the other stalls coz you have to try HOKKIEN MI, CEREAL PRAWNS, and ask another 1 to buy the drinks :) Drinks & food amidst the busy busy gluttons by the bay, with the MBS on the other side greeting you as you chomp the night away
4
We tried food from one stalls, prawns with curry leaves is fantastic! Being 31st of December it was impossible to find a table, so we opted for take away. Delicious!
4
This is a collection of hawker stalls with outdoor seating. Prices are cheap and the there is a lively buzz giving the place a great atmosphere. Some food is good but some is rather ordinary. You may need to wait for a table.
5
variety is excellent. had to wait in line for a table as this place can be packed in the evenings. Singapore street food under one roof. the stingray is a must try. so is the soft shell pepper crab.

Makansutra gluttons bay esplanade singaporeLots of tourist.  We had to wait for 10 minutes for a free table!We went for seafood that night.  Cooking was fast.  Prices were of course higher than the usual hawker stalls, spent more than S$100 total.  Let's get to the food. Seafood fried rice was bland.  Got into the long line for the famous Singaporean Chili crabs. Crabs were fresh but I wasn't happy with the sauce. It tasted like it had catsup in it. Breaded prawns were dry and the crispy squid has a very strong oily aftertaste.  I got to try their  laksa too but it was just ok.  Then we had to hurry off because diners are standing close by eager to grab your table.  Hmmmm.

Makansutra Glutton's Bay is located on the Esplanade promenade. One place you should try to eat. There are many stalls selling typical dishes in Singapore. Food prices are relatively cheap, between SGD 3-15. Depending on the type of food you order. A little bit expensive are the drinks. But the price is still quite reasonable. We ordered 4 different types of cuisine, and everything nice. Overall Makansutra including places to eat that I recommen
3
Its website is definitely exaggerating the whole thing. The food is average, and I found several that should be the signature of this hawker place turn out to be disappointing (i.e. your satay is bleh, so is the pratha). And you'll pay a bit more that the average hawker center in Singapore.During the rainy season, you want to come early to this place to claim the tables under the turp, else enjoy your soaked food under the rain. If the weather is good, you'll want to sit in the tables with Marina Bay view.This is the place to hang out with friends, rather than for food quest. So really, get rid of MSB from your 'die die must try' list, except for the oyster omelette, it might be worth it
3
There's a nice selection of hawker stalls here, and no doubt if you order a few things you'll eat well. Not all of it is local food... there's Filipino and Thai food here too.It does get busy when the sun goes down and you may find yourself circling and waiting for a table. It also gets hot and smokey, even though it's open-air.Prices are a bit higher than you'll pay at an average Singapore hawker centre, but it's all about location. It's the only local food centre at the Esplanade and it's close to the river.If you're coming out of a show at the Esplanade and you're looking for a bite to eat or a beer, Glutton's Bay is a good option. If it's too crowded you can always buy a dessert and take it down to the river.Little Known Fact: If it's earlier in the evening (before 9.30pm) a nicer option is the food hall at Marina Square shopping centre directly across the road, about 5 minutes walk from here. It's upstairs and features a big alfresco balcony that runs the width of the shopping centre with stunning views over the bay. There's a lot more stalls here, it's cheaper and the view is much better
3
This is a relatively small hawkers' market whose greatest advantage is its prime location and seaview. Food is relatively high-priced (compared to Lau Pa Sat, another hawkers food market, and Kopitiam, a chain of indoor fast food stores). You have to pay about S$0.30 for tissue paper and S$1.00-1.50 for a bottle of water, as these will not be provided to you for free. We tried an oyster omelette for S$8, a fried beef and vegetables dish for S$15, and a cup of starfruit juice for S$3. Overall, we did not see value-for-money in the food
4
If there was one place in Singapore where most of the best local dishes could be found together, it would be here at Makansutra Glutton's Bay. Tourists get to taste a bit of everything all at one sitting, instead of having to hop from one place to another. There is also a really wonderful view of the Singapore Flyer
3
Of all other hawker food centers in Singapore, this one is probably the best in terms of :1. View : Stunning marina bay is most enjoyable during clear night time. The lights and glimpse of Marina Bay Sand and Fullerton establishments are always captivating. The best time to enjoy is late at night - around 9.30 - 10pm, so that there are good seats available and the service won't be too slow.2. Location : Esplanade theater is just next door, so you can enjoy pre or post theater dinner without having to walk far.3. Hassle Free : Unlike at some other tourist-packed hawker centers, they neither hassle nor half force you to quickly make up your mind by ordering their food, which is such a big relief if you want to spend a leisurely stroll along the food carts line up to read their menu one by one....The food choice however is limited, although the taste is not bad. Try the chinese seafood and nasi / mee hoon/noodle goreng stalls but Omit the local ice-based delicacy and coconut drinks as they are pale in flavor
5
Fast paced, clean and great cheap food. Lot's of locals and great vibes. Enjoy!
5
This place is a decent hawker center. The best place in Singapore for lunch and dinner. Food ranges from satay, bbq chicken wings, chilli crab, oyster omelette and fried carrot cake. I loved their grilled stingray and their chili crabs.
4
I keep this place high on my list of places I recommend to friends and family that want a real taste of Singapore. Food is very good and the place is memorable. Excellent place for a meal before a walk around the Marina Bay or just sit and enjoy the view...
4
Try the Exotic Sting Ray dish! its really good! and the Carror Cake which isn't actually made of carrots or cake either... So I don't know why they call it that way but it tastes really good. This place is not bad for the wallet as wel
4
We went there with our friends and our kids. Place was very crowded on at Sunday evening but we managed to find a table. Queues were long but it's like this everywhere on a SUnday evening. THe prices are not low but they are not unreasonable. We had chicken wings, 2 types fried noodles, ikan bakar, rojak, oyster egg omelet etc etc and less than $75 inclusive drinks for 4 adults and 2 eight year olds and a toddler.Would go there again
2
i came here for our ramadan break-fasting. there are only less than 10 stalls i guess. my sister and i had thai fried rice which was ok-i wish it was really no pork involved as stated by the seller. my father had fried rice from the indial seller stall which was ok. my mom had a terrible mie rebus. yeah... we visited this place bcause it was the nearest one from our stay in pan pacific and it is shown in singapore city map. the good thing from this place is its view. that's it. better eat somewhere else
3
A decent hawker center in a great location by the river and the Big Durian.It's a fun place with outdoor seating only, and some good food, but certainly not the best in town. But, one of the best values for food and drink in this prime location.Wouldn't make trip just to go there, but if hungry and nearby would get something - if there are any seats available.Despite what you may have read, there are no "must trys" here, but the quality has been ok on the 3 times I visited.Tip: outside of convenience stores, probably the cheapest beer in this area also
4
We love this place, mainly because of the giant prawns and calamari. I don't like seafood but I love the calamari here, it's about the 3rd stall from the end, it's the one thats always busy. Here is one place where beer is not expensive too, unusual for Singapore. Plus we love the area, views to water, marina sands, couple of times there has been live music- it's a great place to watch the world go by and while away an evening.
5
went there on a rainy Monday afternoon after such a long and exhausting day spent at Sentosa. boarded a train and walked the streets of Singapore until we reached Makansutra. who would have thought that such a humble-looking place could to satisfy the greatest of gastronomic cravings? if you are into seafood and hot and spicy delicacies, this is the place to be! think BBQ stingray, fried baby squid and garlic prawns. definitely mouth-watering and worth every buck--they are to die for! if I had the chance, I'd go back to Singapore any day just for those alone. then you'd understand why the place is called Gluttons Bay ;
2
Singapore is reknown for it's food. Makansutra does not do Singapore justice. We tried a couple of dishes from a few different stalls and all took a verrrrrry long time, the self-service meant we had to keep going back to see if it was FINALLY ready, and all dishes were overly greasy and disappointing. Newton Circus, or even the gazillion shopping mall food courts, are far better. Go to one of the restaurants in the bay instead of here.
