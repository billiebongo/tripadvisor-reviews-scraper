love the curry rice! Thou not the best in town. They have all variety of japanese curry food. Also be able to indicate the amount of rice and the spiciness of the curry. I love the mild spiciness curry for children! Will be back!

Their curry gravy and meat are below average. Some store in Singapore do it better than them. Can skip.

I had the yummiest Japanese curry rice so far! The entire plate is completely customizable with chili level, amount of rice and sauce, and wide selection of toppings. Don't miss the soft fluffy omelette!

ordered the wagyu beef curry rice, the waitress told me I could only either have it rare or fully cooked! I wanted medium but since they couldn't do it I ordered fully cooked. When it came, it looked like it came out of a volcano! horrible and not flexible

Coco Ichibanya offers the best Japanese Curry Rice . I ordered the chicken cutlet rice while my friend ordered the pork cutlet rice . The promo meal was 30% bigger in portion than the regular size . However , the price remained the same at $12.90 ++ . To get an orange juice or Apple juice , add $1.50. I did not order a drink; however, cold water or warm water could be served . I would say that it was superb value for money . There were more rice without paying extra . The cutlets were extra large too . I have ever dined at Coco Ichibanya at Siam Paragon @ Bangkok , Shibuya @ Tokyo, Westgate and 313 Somerset in Singapore. The food quality remained very consistent. The sweet pickles were a great accompaniment to the curry rice . Monster Curry @ Ion does not come close (at all).

I went to the newly open branch at Raffles City Tower. Thanks to groupon, i got quite a good deal. I like the curry and the way how they present. it is consider slightly expensive if dine in full pay. You can choose the spiciness of the curry you want. I went for level 3(just nice for me) and my sister chose level 5(very spicy but she said it is shiok). I had omelette pork chop rice, very good combination with all the stuff i love. The free flow pickles are good to go with curry rice

I. Went to the Coco Ichibanya in Plaza Singapore. It was 1900 on Saturday night. o The service was average, but at least positive. o Curry was smooth and not burning hot. II. I got myself cream chicken omelette with level 2 spiciness. o Although the gyoza was obviously from packet, at least they fried it fresh on order. o Casual. Rather affordable. III. My friend and I spend around a total of S$42 for two curry omelettes, gyoza, a glass of mango syrup. x Chicken cubes were alright. But rather evident that they were frozen before. x Omelette was not fried and wrapped as pretty as the menu. Edible still. - For those who has UOB card, you can enjoy 10% discount but only at a minimum of S$50 spent.

I love all different kind of curries and Japanese curry dishes are among them. They are very different from The other Asia countries curries. I can always taste the Turmeric powder and cumin powder, two of my favourite spices. Though I am not a fan of the Peppery spicy, I would not say 'No' to Japanese curry.This is my 4th time at Coco Ichibanya in this year but the 1st time at this outlet. It was packed but we were lucky that we only had to wait for a few minutes. The restaurant is on 1st floor and you can find it easily from taxi stand entrance and the opposite entrance. It's not a very big outlet but clean. The outlet is kind of an open concept so you can feel the atmosphere of Bugis+ (all crowds, noise and more). If you would like to enjoy a quieter atmosphere, I wouldn't recommend so. Just go to Westgate outlet as you can sit inside for slightly quieter atmosphere. But it's good to go there with some friends, chit chat (a bit loudly so that the person your opposite could hear you.) and have fun.For overall, service, I find that the servers are more helpful and courteous than the outlet in Westgate. Perhaps they are more use to the busy hour and more experience employees of Coco Ichibanya. Our server skilfully took the order, repeated them to confirm and quickly came back with the cutlery basket and three straws. Then, within five minutes, the drinks were there as well as side dishes. and then in the next five minutes, the curry dishes were served. The service was very efficient. There were no wrong food order or missing cutlery or straws for drinks like the other outlet. All of us ordered Set Menu B (a salad, a bowl of miso soup and a choice of drink from the green and purple menu selection), different spiciness level and different curry. I have my normal level 5. Though, I find that they need to give us options for higher level as I normally love to eat spicier curry. Wagyu steak for me and a snack basket to share, this time. Our server informed me that it was medium rare. (points for her as some people couldn't stomach a little red and bloody meat). The food taste still the same, smelled divine - a little sweetness from the curry based and the peppery spiciness is not overwhelming the rest of the flavour. The beef though was a bit disappointing with the portion (different from the photo). But I guess that the amount we got with this price range. The snack basket tasted great. Gyozas were hot and juicy. The sausages looked cute with the octopus cut. But I was surprise that sausages were Taiwanese style sausages. That was something I didn't expect. But if you like them, that's a plus point for this snack basket. Overall, there's not much negative things to say from me for this dining experience. I enjoyed the service here more and the food, as usual - taste great
