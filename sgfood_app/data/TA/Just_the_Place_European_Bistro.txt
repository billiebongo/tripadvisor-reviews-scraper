We went there for a dinner date amd service was fast and friendly. Nice sea side view. Clams were fresh but too salty. Pizza was good and crepe was disappointing.

The location on the 2nd floor allows a great view of the sea as well as cool breeze. We enjoyed the food all round. Had the pasta, baby back ribs, salted egg Fish N Chips. Service was good.

Food was good, especially the Creamy Chicken Mushroom Pasta. However, the portion was rather small and prices a bit on the high side. Service was good. Overall, a good place for decently good food.

Pleasant service. We didn't order much but mostly beer and truffle fries. Portion was great for the price ! Will visit again

One of the better brunch places I've been in Singapore. Highly recommended for brunch.
Try their Eggs Ben and Roast chicken!

Food is generally great but their signature Hangar Steak was a disappointment. We ordered medium well but the steak was tough to chew on.

I went there with a few friends for a late lunch. The place has a nice view to offer. I was there with some of my vegetarian friends. We ordered some truffle fries, just veges aglio olio and prawn aglio olio.For vegetarians, the options are limited to Margherita pizza, Vege aglio olio pasta and some starters, which is more than many what many other restaurants offer in this area.I tried the prawn aglio olio, which was delicious. The prawn was well cooked and succulent. It was just a tad more salty then expected. A good dish to try here. Overall this place is a good to hang out for a nice view and good food. Prices are slightly on the higher side

Was there on Sunday and what a lovely cafe to have a late lunch. Mushroom soup was done right and the chicken dish was a good size when you’re really hungry Simple things done right! Staff was attentive; didn’t manage to get her name. The view was lovely and i reckon lovelier on late evening.Thank you

The restaurant is part of the Punggol Settlement, an entertainment area at the top of Punggol overlooking the strait. The food is Mediterranean style. I do not recommend the pasta, as it was sour and not well cooked. The pizza was okay. The clams were quite good, but the servings are too small for the prices they charge. Service could be better as they are somehow inattentive. Overall not a place I would recommend

It's a nice place to sit, 2nd floor with view into Coney Island. Good quality was ok but portions (especially the mushroom ragout with poached egg) was too small for the price. My husband's fish was an ok size but mine and my son's pizza far too small. Friendly waitress!
