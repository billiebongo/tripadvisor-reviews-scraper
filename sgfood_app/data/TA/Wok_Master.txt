So good that I grabbed a second one. It's the one at the back of the menu with lychee and basil seeds. They make it with the perfect coolness and smooth texture.

Good place for a simple meal or for gathering.

I have already visited this place for more than 2 times and in terms of food quality, they never disappoint. For "zi char" standard, I think they do better than most "zi char" stalls in coffee shops. Service is good and they food were served promptly. I would recommend you all to try

Was here recently after our shopping. Small place but cozy. Food was delicious and what I like is they use fresh ingredients, eg the Pork for their daily soup are fresh no frozen smell & taste, curry chicken sauce very delicious, meat not the frozen chicken which is good, we order the $38 set menu, the seafood pot was yummy, kailan was crunchy. Will come back if we are shopping around this are

This was a nice place to eat for us.We ordered 4 dishes to share between the 3 of us and there was plenty to go round. The food was served fresh and hot to our table and the restaurant was clean and well presented. Great food and friendly staff - (also English speaking which was handy)

Personally love the crayfish tanghoon herbal soup. The broth is thick and yummy! The mixed pot (一品锅) is pretty normal and sort of pricey for the amount. Nonetheless, the gravy is good. Nice ambience and located in a mall with lots of selection. Will be back to try the other stuff. Saw lots of unique and interesting dishes.

This time went with a bigger group. Managed to try more dishes. We like most of the dishes ordered. Though not wow, but all were prepared nicely. Surprisingly, they do have western dishes like fish & chips, and tasted good too. We also like the fast service

This is an authentic Chinese Food Restaurant, located in the heart of tourist spot - Little India. The food is simply fantastic, reasonably priced and proper quantity. We ordered vegetarian claypot rice noodles and Fried rice. They were simply outstanding and had an authentic Chinese cuisine flavours and touch. Service was prompt and we were attainted happily. Apart from variety of options for seafood lovers and other non vegetarian options, this place has 4 Vegetarial options to offer.I would strongly recommend this place to vegetarian and non-vegetarian lovers.Food - 4.5/5Service - 4/5Price - 4/5Location - 5/
