This is a very popular vegetarian stall at Redhill. You often see a long queue but it moves fast. The bee hoon is white and very fragrant. You get the standard vegetarian toppings and some sauce. It's simple food but very yummy.

Ru Yi Yuan Vegetarian Food has two stalls, one at Redhill Lane and the other one at Bk 279 Bukit Batok East Ave 4. Of the two the one at Bukit Batok is more popular. This stall in the coffee shop opens at 5.30 am to 1.00 pm but you can see a long queue at 5.00 am. The queue of diners is very long throughout the day and if you want to buy a plate of mee hoon you may have to wait for half an hour. The quality of the food is good and each plate costs $3.00. You can add side dishes like popiah and tofu. Some buyers buy as many as 10 packets of food and that is why the waiting time is so long. As the food is excellent and cheap the number of patrons is more than those of other stalls in the vicinity

If you like Indian food that is tasty then go here. The food is great and staff very friendly and courteous. Try the Thali and you won't be disappointed washed down with mango lassi. It'll set you back less than $20. The restaurant closes at 22.30 weekdays 23.00 fri/sat so don't leave it too late

I have been introduced to this place for vegetarian bee hoon by relatives. It's by far the best vegetarian bee hoon I have had in Singapore. The bee hoon is flavorful with nice mixture of tofu, vegetables and fried bean curd. There's perpetually long queues but they close on Wednesdays. They open by 530am and sell out before noon. The hawker aunties are very friendly and they actually remember my preferences by the 2nd visit.
