Great location to meet friends for a casual lunch. Set lunch from $10 and most mains below $20. Food was good and service was surprisingly prompt. Will definitely visit again.

This is a nice place for coffee and chat. There is a wide variety of food options but the food quality is average.
4
one can get variety of food and juice to choose . i however choose to have juice as veg options were limited

A lovely place to take a break for lunch or tea, away from the afternoon heat.
The chef recommended chili soft shell crab pasta was appealing and appetizing.
Away from the busy part of town and peaceful place to chill.
5
The food is good and service excellent but what is most amazing is that this is a training facility for individuals with disabilities- a safe venue to interact. Will certainly come back again. The food is inexpensive too.
5
Came again to see the slightly updated menu and of course to support our favourite social enterprise.
Chilli Crab Pasta was still a hit and chips for the kids!

Brought a friend here for lunch and drinks. We were served by a young lady with learning challenges but she did her job well. My friend was impressed by the service and the work opportunities given to people with learning challenges. Well done.

Located at a busy crossroad in Orchard Road, this cafe is a good place to watch people passing by. It offers Happy Hour and a selection of beers and wines, as well as a selection of food. We shared a BLT Ciabatta which was good, and each had a Tiger Beer which was better. Not a memorable place but OK if you are hot, hungry and thirsty
4
Was there two evenings ago with a friend. We were both sufficiently hungry and yet disciplined enough to not over-order. So I chose the LAKSA. It came in white porcelain bowl filled to the rim with noodles and ingredients.It did not have all the usual laksa trimmings but the gravy carried the dish and it was delicious. This was washed down by a small bottle of Perrier.Clearly a social enterprise that provides opportunities for those with less noticeable disabilities and youths-at-risks....it was a very pleasant venue for a nice tete-a-tete. And because of its noble cause of giving back to the community in manifest ways, yes, I will be back and will bring my friends

It's a nice place to chill out on a hot afternoon. We walked past this and decided to give it a go. Food and drinks are sat reasonable prices , as well as for a good cause. The coffee was commendable , nicely complemented with coffee art
5
We only went by for an afternoon coffee but the service was so good! The staff were kind, patient and very attentive to refill our water whenever it was low. Will definitely visit again!
4
Great service, very clean and comfortable. Food range was good as it covered both wof western, Asian and a fusion of both. Laksa was excellent and the chili crab pasta was nice. Truffled mayonnaise dip for the fries was great as well.
4
The menu was great with local & western selection . Price was cheap and delicious food . The service was awesome . Only disadvantage is the chairs & tables. The tables are too low for the chairs. Very uncomfortable while eating.
4
I love the local delights and all day brunch items.
All profits go to charity! Best of all worlds - you get to do your part for charity and enjoy good food at the same time!
4
Food was very good and on a
quite street away from the main street. Menu is limited and were able to find something that we liked.
4
The food is good. We have been there twice for breakfast and lunch. Choice for breakfast is limited - but pancakes are good. The choice for brunch/ lunch is enormous from local/ western and italian dishes. Must goIt is simple place run by a churc
5
A great central locale for everything Ordered the berry ribs (moist and succulent), chili crab pasta (what a kick), cottage pie (comforting) and potato dippers (sinful)Great service from Irfan!And it's a social enterprise cafe and what is better to pay for good food for a great cause 
4
My wife told me that this restaurant is run as a 'social venture' but as a dining experience that was an irrelevant issue. The service from the time we entered to the time we paid the bill and left was professional, warm and effective. The menu is varied with both Asian and non Asian varieties. I found it difficult to choose and resolved to visit again. My Asian beef dish was excellent served as it was with miso soup accompaniment. My wife had coffee with her meal but I settled for warm water and my glass was refilled a number of times. The venue is open, clean and pleasant. Strongly recommended

Went to this social enterprise for a relative's birthday lunch with 11 others, Crossings Cafe being the first visit for most of us. We were seated in 2 rows of 6, facing each other, so conversation was impossible between people sitting at either end. This was the only downside though...but nothing to stop us from walking around to talk to those not within our ear shot!Among us, our orders included Crisp green & honey tangerine salad, Signature chilli crab pasta, Fish & chips, Beef cottage pie, Honey berry ribs, Baked Norwegian salmon and Lamb shank. Verdict based on feedback:-Lamb shank and the Signature chilli crab pasta came out tops!!-Honey berry ribs = good but the portion could have been larger-Baked Norwegian salmon was given a thumb down coz of "both the fish itself and the sauce"I had the chilli crab pasta and in my view, the chilli crab claw meat sauce could have been more spicy but overall, it was very delicious and I like the fried soft shell crab topping!For drinks, noteworthy would be Trappist Beer (there is a chart describing each type - this was passed to us by the server when we asked her what's the difference between Orval and Westmalle). Kudos for her efficiency and very good attitude which is priceless:)) As usual, my review will always include mention of deserving staff and in this instance, I would like to single out the female bespectacled server who took our orders, served the dishes, cleared the table and took time to listen to special requests we made of certain dishes and helping us out of the Trappist Beer jargon trap!

We were in the city and it was almost dinner time. Famished, we looked for a quiet and average place to have dinner. It was humid and so an air-conditioned place was the plan. We found this cafe just beside the Catholic Church of Sts. Peter and Paul ( back part of the church). It was cosy and the food was good. My friends went for simpler meals like the wrap, mac and cheese, etc but I went for their signature dish which is the pork ribs with berry sauce and it was very nice. The meat just fell off the bones and I felt it was a nice twist to having sweet potato fries in place of the potato ones. I was happy to discover the cafe had the TripAdvisor seal posted on their door and it was an opportunity for me check the cafe out myself.The ambience was alright and the staff were ok with the exception of one gentleman who was very attentive. Kudos to him. Sorry, I forget his name. He is a little large and wears black or dark rimmed glasses.Service for the food can be quicker but I guess maybe because we were all so hungry it seemed that the food was taking forever to arrive.On the while, yes, I am going back again
4
Food is true to local taste and decent portions. The set lunches are good value for money. Service is prompt. Parking is an issue around the area especially during lunch times but there are several hotels 50m to 100m walk away.
4
This is a great concept and does enhance the value of the meal. The food was exceptional with great service. a good restaurant, highly enjoyable and we will be back for more. keep up the good work.
4
They hire special needs adults to wait and serve at the cafe.
The food is above average and they are currently serving a Lenten menu for the Lenten season.
They also serves Trappist beer made at Trappist monastery.

It was my first time to Crossing Cafe with my Best Friend to support our Friend who is singing for the event organised by Memories Cafe.We ordered Soft Shell Pasta and Prawn Quesadilla. The food was great. We were served by a friendly waitress, Ruiting.. She is polite and attentive
3
Went for afternoon tea with my mum. I ordered an Oolong tea and sausage puff pastry, she got a latte and a cheesecake.The sausage puff pastry had been reheated in the microwave and the sausage had no flavour at all â€“ horrible. The tea was nice but nothing special, it's just a tea-bag. The latte and cheesecake were quite nice though, it seems I just chose the wrong products!My advice: steer clear of the savoury pastries (maybe they're okay when fresh but not in the afternoon), but go ahead if you're after some cheap and nice cake/coffee
5
We had breakfast at Crossings on two occasions and thoroughly enjoyed the food and the coffee. Service was excellent and the staff were efficient and friendly.The menu is quite limited, but the food was fresh and well cooked.Our cappuccinos were excellent and this all got our day started properly.Heartily recommend Crossing
4
Had business lunch with a client who bought me to this restaurant. She likes the idea of this restaurant which is a social enterprise. While we enjoyed our lunch, the service doesn't lapse and the food was delightful. I will urge you to support this restaurant for business to continue for a good cause. Well done and all staff to keep up with their fantastic service!
5
A pleasant, quiet place that serves good food and drinks with good service for decent prices. Wine starts at $33 for a bottle of Chilean. Tried the berry pork ribs and they were very good. Came with excellent sweet potato fries. Bonus: Crossings is a social enterprise so it feels good eating here. They don't trade on that though, preferring to let their food and service do the talking
4
This is one of those "must do" places in Singapore. I like when my food dollars go further than just the meal I got.... Crossings is a social enterprise set up to assist and train people with employment barriers who might never get a fair go anywhere else.They also make good tasty food and serve nice wine and drinks too,I have tried their coffee and rank it VERY HIGH in the coffees I've had in Singapore.Lunch is popular, but I have only had dinner. A simple and concise menu was offered. Being the period of Lent, Fish and seafood were offered instead of the usual selection of meats and poultry. Atlantic salmon with asparagus, Stirfried seafood and sea bass were tasted at our table and every one enjoyed.By having dinner here you support an amasing training program, encourage others to strive and find their own independence. This is priceless.
4
Went there twice cause of the surprisingly tasty food. Just that they took about 20 minutes to prepare despite no crowd was there at the time when I went. But I personally think it is worth the wait. Their salad and vegeterian sandwich tastes really good. I also like that all sales profits will go to charity :
4
Happened upon Crossings cafe for lunch whilst shopping in the area. It is a not for profit place which helps disadvantaged members of society. Food was good and there was plenty of choice. We had tandoori chicken sandwich and crab pasta. Recommended.
4
All proceed from this cafe will be used for charity...the foods are also good. The beer so tasty. My fav is an ice cream with coffee on the bottom. Delicious.... come try n charity in one package..

Crossings Cafe is a social enterprise employing youths at risk with proceeds going to charity. When I first visited them twice last year, their menu was more local/ local fusion. Today, their menu has evolved towards western less local. Thus, more items like fish and chips, less items like Laksa and chili crab pasta. I liked it the way it was. Those local and local- western dishes made them comfortably appealing yet unique. I'm unsure the new direction is taking them to a good place. Still, I'd support it because it is a worthy cause and food is ok
5
Heard about this cafe and went down to try with my husband ! It was such a great experience that I brought my foodie kids down to try! The service is sincere and food is great! Prices are very reasonable! Try the Aglio Olio, chilli crab pasta; burgers and bread are great! Cappuccino and ice cream are fabulous
4
I went there twice, once alone and the other time with a group. The first time alone the cafe did not have a table and I was told to wait. It was just a short wait and very pleasant too because the cafe interior is so cosy. I ordered the lunch specials both times and they were good. Portions might be smaller than expected but I was full each time. Loved seeing how the supervisor was so patient with the service crew who are either youths at-risk or those with special needs.Try the panna cotta
4
We happened upon this place by accident, it is very close to our hotel so very convenient. We arrived a little early for dinner but they accommodated us. Food was very good. We especially enjoyed having ice cream at the end of the meal. Best value ever. $2 a scoop.
4
Ate here twice in a week. Food was worth the price. For breakfast, I had pancakes and dinner, I had pasta. Both were good.Staff were attentive and service was great All profits from this establishment are donated to charity and the staff are from the socially disadvantaged segment of societyHere you can have a good meal and do a good deed. What more can you ask for

The café is located on 55 Waterloo Street, on the ground floor of the Catholic Centre. Do note that Waterloo Street is one-way going towards Bras Basah Road, so if you’re driving, you’ll have to enter via Middle Road. Parallel parking lots are available along the stretch of road just after the turning. Alternatively, you can try parking at Hotel Royal Queens, which is on the parallel Queen Street. The hotel carpark is really narrow and hard to manoeuvre though. To reach the café, just head out the lobby and walk through the small lane just opposite the hotel; Crossings is at the end of the lane. But honestly I would just take the MRT instead. It’s a lot more convenient! The nearest MRT station would be Bras Basah (Yellow or Circle Line). Take Exit E and walk up along Waterloo Street; the café is diagonally opposite the Singapore Calligraphy Centre.Crossings may seem like just any other café serving up Western (and some Asian) mains, but it is actually a social enterprise venture aimed at helping disadvantaged youths by providing them with internships and jobs at the café. Some reviewers noted that the prices are slightly steeper than elsewhere, but I feel the prices here are still quite competitive; mains here cost around S$14-18, while the desserts are all less than S$10. All profits from Crossings get channelled into other charities anyway, so I guess it wouldn’t really hurt to pay a little bit more?!My family went down as a big group, so we took the opportunity to sample their different items. Food choices are a little limited, but while they lack in variety, they make up for it in terms of taste. I photographed a number of dishes we ordered just to let you readers have a feel of what is offered here at Crossings. I didn’t get to try all of them, so I’m only going to focus on the ones I sampled. Fish and Chips (S$14) was really good; the fish fillet was well-breaded and fried to crisp perfection on the outside while still soft and pillowy on the inside. Served with salad and a bed of fries, this dish is definitely more than enough for one. The Chicken and Aubergine Parmigiana (S$16) is another impressive dish; the serving is generous and they managed to lock in the moisture of the meat in the crisp batter remarkably well. I had the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich (S$15) which was delicious as well; the pulled pork was just so tender! The Prawn Aglio Olio (S$15) was another amazing dish that was flavourful. For the sides, I liked the Onion Rings (S$6) best, which taste a little like the ones served at Burger King, only larger. Their Fries (S$6) are quite good too. Taste-wise, they remind me a lot of the curly fries served at MacDonald’s during Chinese New Year. Most mains are usually accompanied by fries (be it potato or sweet potato), so you don’t really have to order any extra! The Chicken Wings (S$8) though, were too salty for my liking.Desserts are also quite limited here. Cake of the Day (S$5) was a sea salt and caramel cake, which I liked for its light caramel flavour, but I couldn’t really pick out any saltiness to be honest. Panna Cotta of the Day (S$5) was a milk tea flavoured one, which was nice. It’s served in a cute dessert jar topped with Gula Melaka (this brown-coloured palm sugar syrup) and strawberries. The Panna Cotta tastes like the pudding-version of the milk tea you get from KOI or Gong Cha. I felt that the dessert could have reduced the amount, or even done away with the palm sugar syrup altogether because it made the Panna Cotta too sweet. My family liked the Profiteroles (S$7), but I thought they were just ok. I felt the ice cream lacked flavour which made the dessert taste flat overall. My favourite was the Molten Cake with Ice Cream (S$9). What’s interesting is that they offer the molten cake in flavours like white chocolate and hazelnut, apart from the usual chocolate. I wanted to try the white chocolate flavoured one but they ran out of it unfortunately, so I settled for hazelnut instead. It looks just like the original chocolate-flavoured one, but there’s a hint of hazelnut when you actually get round to sinking your teeth into this chocolate goodness. They’re really generous with the ice cream too! The dessert is quite rich so order to share.Most of the staff here are quite friendly, and the service attentive. Even though we were a big group, the staff who served us took the effort to remember who ordered what and served the dishes accordingly. There were some individuals who were a lot more reserved, but their service was just as attentive. All in all, I think Crossings Café met a lot of my expectations, and I would recommend you readers to try it out! I for one would definitely return for their white chocolate molten cake

We always see this cafe on our way to church and decided to try it one time. The ambience is relaxing and the staff service is good. We have tried their chicken wings and it was delicious. Plus factor for this cafe is that they help the disadvantaged youths. Will definitely go here again
3
Found this Cafe tucked away from the bustle of Bugis area. Great Ambience and good selection if dishes. The soup we tried was okay but the sea bass was very tasty. We found it Just a tad bit overpriced. The cafe employs disadvantaged members of society, which is a brilliant initiative
5
Highly recommend this place - i walked pass so many times and it always looks busy- finally give it a go today and tomorrow its worth it
staff are nice and food is good what else do we ask for from a restaurant?
5
Had read about this social enterprise, and came out of curiosity. No sympathy votes needed. Salad / crab bisque / fish in "sambal cream" all beyond reproach . Good range of beers. Will definitely return !
5
The best thing about Crossings Cafe is that it isn't just good food. It's a restaurant that deliberately employs disadvantaged young people in order to give them a start. And all of its profits go into charity work. That is a real winning combination.The food is good. The service is good. But the idea is WONDERFUL! If you are in downtown Singapore, avail yourself of something more than a meal. Make what you eat become a statement of compassion. You'll love the taste

Was walking aimlessly around the vicinity of Bras Basah one afternoon with a friend when i was attracted by a colorfully painted wall in this restaurant. After checking out their menu, i realised that they actually offer rather affordable tea time sets- A croissant/muffin with coffee/tea for S$5 or a slice of cake with coffee/tea for S$7. On a weekday afternoon, the place is quiet and cosy, perfect for those who like being in quiet and undisturbed places to do some reading or a gentle conversation with some friends. However, it can get pretty crowded at night, so be sure to make reservations before hand if you are planning to come in a big group.At this cafe i tried:-Ice coffee -Chocolate muffin (which is very rich the way that i like)-Oreo cheesecake -tomato soup (Absolutely lovely

I was very impressed with the level of service and the quality of the food. The staff were attentive and I must have had my glass topped up at least 5 times with ice water. (It was a hot day!)The waiter who was intellectually challenged even asked if I wanted an extra plate when I told him I would be sharing my dessert . Our main dishes of chilli crab pasta sambal cream fish were delicious! The chilli crab was served with 2 soft shell crabs that were crisp and not over oily. Definitely value for money as the servings were quite large.My only disappointment was that the display board had iced mango soufflé as one of the desserts offered when it had already been taken off the menu. I would suggest that the management use a chalk board for their specials instead of writing with permanent ink. I applaud the whole idea of gainful employment for those who are disabled
5
I was given a nice lunch treat at this cafe run by an organization helping to give employment to intellectually challenged adults. It was very heart warming to see these ID people working with dignity here. Both the food and the service exceeds my expectations. Good job

I had read and heard of Crossings Café but did not get the opportunity to visit. Met a friend who highly recommended I go and I was very pleased that I took his recommendation to have lunch at Crossings.Crossings is a social enterprise café and it provides employment to some of the less fortunate. But that does not in any way reduce its attraction as a great café which serves good food at affordable prices. If I had to gripe, it would be that it can be a little noisy especially when it gets crowded and perhaps the restaurant might want to find some ways to dampen the noise. If you're in the art district of Singapore and find yourself in need of sustenance, I would recommend having a meal or a tea break at Crossings

This is a relatively new entry to the list of F&B social enterprises. The social cause is to provide work opportunities in the F&B industry for disadvantaged youths. The establishment also donates the net profits to charities.Yesterday evening, July 2 2014, my friends and I had a very enjoyable dining experience. The service was warm and friendly; all smiles throughout the evening. They were attentive, and responded promptly to our every request.We had the soup of the day - Carrot soup. I liked the texture and taste, not too thick and not too thin while having that gentle hint of carrot. We also had one of the salads - Crisp Greens and Honey Tangerine Salad; perfect to go along with any of the main dishes or all its own, too. The Australian rockets and baby spinach were fresh and crunchy. The slight bitter taste of the rockets were complemented by the citrus vinaigrette sauce drizzled lightly, giving a nice balance to the taste. Candied walnuts, cherry tomatoes and crispy bacon bits added zest to the salad.For mains, we could not decide. So we ordered 3 mains and shared. We had Char-grilled Thai Chicken Burger, Honey Mustard Ribs, and Beef Cottage Pie. Of the three, I liked the Beef Cottage Pie the best; the minced corn fed beef with creamy mashed potato was so soft and full of flavor. The Thai Chicken Burger was all right, although I could not figure out why the claim that the chicken was Thai spice-marinated? Hardly could taste that. Perhaps the mango salsa overwhelmed the thai spices? The Honey Mustard Ribs was quite a disappointment. It was tender but dry. The only saving grace of this dish was the sweet potato fries; very delicious. I suppose when I do stop by for afternoon tea, the sweet potato fries alone would be a nice snack to go with a refreshing beverage. (Note: They do sell Sides and Bites, and Sweet Potato Fries is one of the items; others include Garlic Bread, Crispy Chicken Wings, and more)After the meal, we ordered desserts - Velvet Cake and Molten Cake (Original) with Ice Cream. Sorry that I forgot to take photos to share here. Was caught up in the moment. It was my birthday celebration, and the cakes came out with candles, we did the whole birthday song and wish thing. So forgot to take pics. The Velvet Cake was quite good. To be honest, I heard about Velvet Cakes, and wondered what the fuss was all about. I tried it at other cafes and felt nothing sensational about those. The Velvet Cake here at Crossings changed that. This time, I could definitely taste the cream cheese icing. Not too strong, just enough. The Molten Cake was very good. But then again, I am partial to anything with dark chocolate (but must be good dark chocolate). So it was two thumbs up for the Molten Cake. The vanilla ice cream that came with it was not so good. When taken with the Molten Cake, the vanilla ice cream came across as weak and diluted. Perhaps they could use a vanilla ice cream that has a more milky taste (better if with good quality milk)?Overall, we enjoyed our dinner at Crossings. While some of the dishes could be improved, the ambience was warm and friendly, and it was a very pleasant dining experience. Besides me, seemed other people also liked to have their birthdays here. I was told by my friends (who had been to Crossings before) that weekends can get very crowded. I am not sure if they accept reservations. But if they do, I suggest making a reservation on weekends.Getting to Crossings is easy. If you drive, there are public car parks along Waterloo Street. For me, I took the MRT train, and alighted at Bras Basah station. Crossings is just a mere few minutes walk away
4
Great place, friendly service, simple but good food and good value for money. To add to that they add value to the community by giving opportunities for people with challenges to be gainfully employed and contribute to social causes from their profits. Many reasons to return
5
A local friend took me to Crossings Cafe for lunch. It is a not for profit establishment. Great cafe food pawn pasta was fresh and delicious. I would highly recommend this place. What was inspiring about the place was there inclusiveness of people with a disability on their staff
