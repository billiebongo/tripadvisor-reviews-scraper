Laksa broth was extremely lackluster for the price.
Rude staff.
Several menu items were already not available at lunchtime.

I enjoyed my experience here. This is a new place but its ambience and food is unique and I would definitely recommend it!

Amazing food and service <3 their chili crab XLB is definitely something to try. I was a bit skeptical at first but theirs was well made.

Had a lunch gathering at Chinese Noodle bar. Didn't quite measure up to the reviews I heard. I would say a passable meal. I found the steamed dumplings a little too spicy.

Don’t we all wish when we patronize a restaurant, that we are greeted by friendly and cheerful staff who not only knows and enthused with their menu but recommends dishes without hesitation (and not, “Everything is good here,” or “It depends …”)? To top it off, the food actually tastes and lives up to their detailed description.I recently had a simple but most enjoyable lunch experience at Blue Lotus at Savourworld at Ascent, Science Park. The waitress and I reckon the manager, were most enthusiastic. You wished all Singapore restaurant staff are like that. He recommended the pork chop noodles even though I had intended for something plainer. When it came as a soup, my first reaction was the pan-fried pork chop would be more appropriately served dry. But I was proven wrong. The pork chop was tender enough to bite without the need for fork and knife. It was very nicely cooked and marinated juicily: delicious without being overpowering in taste. The soup was like the manager described: a special stock and yet too strong in flavour like in some ramen. Noodles were needless to say, cooked perfectly al dente.For sides, I opted for the traditional xiao long bao instead of their signature crab with pomelo. I ate them in my usual way of piercing a notch to suck out the stock, then eat the Shanghainese dumpling with a dash of julienned ginger with dark vinegar. The pan-fried onion pancakes were as well described by the manager: light and not too doughy.My pet peeve at restaurants is them charging for water. But I soon forgot that, as they were attentively topping up my glass of warm water throughout my meal.Yes, I could get spoilt and get used to eating well and feted at Blue Lotus at not just Savourworld but their other outlets.Speaking of Savourworld, it is a very interesting concept: a joint project between f&b entrepreneur Michel Lu and his partner with developer Ascendas Singbridge to create a f&b hub. Young chefs and f&b startups shy of a large capital investment, can lease their spaces with fitted kitchens and revenue-share with Savourworld. There’s even an event hall to host culinary events and food festivals

Restaurant that charges for hot water, and disallows usto drink from our own water bottles. service was brisk. Food was really meh for the price, i can get much better chinese noodles somewhere else. Chili crab xlb was really too spicy and stomach burning. The chili masked the taste. Only redeeming dish was the drunken chicken.

I went there with my Daughter. We ordered crispy pork noodle, dumpling soup noodle, Chili crabmeat dumpling, and braise tofu. The noodles were good but the Chili crab dumplings a bit too oily, environment was cozy and able to chill and chat. Overall experience was average

I am a fan of blue lotus at quayside and was excited to try the noodle bar @ savourworld but it turned out to be a great disappointment. I've summarised my experience according to the poor service and quality of food.1. I went to the restaurant and told staff I had a reservation. The staff did not ask for my name and brought me to my seat, I did not pursue further as I assumed I was the only customer who reserved at that timing. As expected, blue lotus updated under the chope app that I did not turn up. 2. Their signature king prawn noodles was also overrated and did not turn out to be what other instagram reviewers had raving on. The tea leaf egg was bland and the only passable item I recommend was their braised pork rice.3. After the dining experience, the supervisor on duty asked for feedback but was not attentive enough. When I told him it was not a pleasant experience, he was busy settling the bill and took awhile to clarify. He was then defensive and cited the tea leaf egg was soaked overnight and appeared unbelievable with my unsatisfactory review of the food. All he could respond was "sure" upon hearing my feedback. 4. I highly recommend their staff to undergo customer service training and hence I wrote to the blue lotus instagram account holder and subsequently emailed them. Sadly, there were no written replies to both platforms. Subsequently, I received a call and I think it is from the same person (Supervisor) who called me to follow up (after I had written to Chope to complain on the inaccurate status reflected and poor service). As I was occupied, the call ended within minutes as all the Supervisor could do was to tell me blue lotus will give me the Chope dollars (for every successful Chope reservation) and told me they will follow up on my feedback regarding the poor food quality and service. 5. Frankly speaking, I expected blue lotus to be more customer centric and humble instead of adopting a defensive mode and paying lip service because til today, I was not given any Chope dollars and shouldn't blue lotus at least reply my email? I suggest diners to give this outlet a miss and visit quayside if you want good quality of food and of course, great service as the staff there are friendly and approachable.Thank you

Not a fan of pork, so I ordered the vegetarian version of the mushroom truffle la mian, a bowl of chicken soup, and the chilli crab xiao loong bao.Loved loved loved the xiao loong bao! The juices and the taste were absolutely yum!And the la mian was just right. The truffle oil was not over saturated. Will be back there again when in the area
