We visited Carpenter and Cook three times whilst visiting our family in Singapore and were very pleased with their egg and avocado on waffle and also egg with pulled pork all washed down with refreshing Australian ginger beer.
5
Great Place to chill out. The passionfruit tarts are the best to go with a cup of coffee. Great place to do reading, or catch up with friends.

Probably because I love vintage items, the moment I stepped into the cafe, I fell in love with it. The food presentation was beautiful with the use of those vintage English plates. The food that I had tasted great. A wonderful place for a afternoon tea, brunch, lunch & dinner. Service was good too
4
Came here recently and tried one of the smoothies on offer. This was really quite tasty, and the service was friendly and efficient. My only criticism here is that the drinks were served in disposable packaging - not really so environmentally friendly. But a great little cafe with a good atmosphere
5
This cafe is a must visit. I have lived in Singapore for three years, and this cafe still provides one of my favourite coffee's. In all of my visits (which was every week), I have never received poor service. The staff are always friendly and accommodating. They even offer a cheaper priced coffee for their regulars. The baked goods are baked fresh each day and are delicious! And the setting has a 50's feel that is like stepping back in time

Went for brunch. Setting is pleasant and relaxing. Most people were having a drink and a pastry. Not crowded. The prices were relatively high. We picked from their brunch menu instead - Potato Waffle and Croque Monsieur. The Waffle portion was on the small side but the latter was huge. More importantly, taste wise, both didn't blow us away. Just so so. We had Flat Whites. Too milky, coffee was weak. Have had better in other places.

Came late after work. Had the potato and leek soup, mushroom quiche, grilled broccoli, scone and clotted cream, tea and babyccino . Soup was very well done. Great texture and taste. They finished it with some heavy cream and it was lovely. Portion size was just right. 8/10Grilled broccoli was done just right. Not overly wilted, but not under cooked. Just the right amount of char. Tossed with sliced garlic, chili slices and lemon bits. Good interpretation. 8/10Scone and clotted cream. Scone was piping hot and went perfectly with the cream and the jam. Not overly crumbly and not too dry. Just the right texture. 8/10Mushroom quiche. You know you got it right when the melody of egg, cheese and buttery crust make music on your tongue. 8/10Service was absolutely friendly and they made you feel comfortable and very welcome. Definitely a great place to chill with a nice book. Made for a great impromptu date location with its unique ambiance.

The lovely ambience coupled with the vintage furniture and decorations with a cup of coffee matched with passionfruit meringue, best dessert place!
If you love ice chocolate, do try their Chocolate sea salt caramel frappe, taste really fabulous

Had awesome carrot cake here. Ambience takes the cake too. Coffee is good.
Little steep in the price department.
4
The ambience is lovely. The cafe is full with decors. Pretty interesting. The food we had is decent. Milkshake is nice. A very good place to chill out and relax. :)
4
Nice chill place for hanging out. The cafe is vintage-themed and slightly quirky. My friends and I enjoyed the lemon tarts and coffee.
The passionfruit meringue tart and banoffee tart are worth trying too.
4
Great lemon tarts and lemon shortcake. But it's a little on the expensive side. Good ambience for a weekend coffee or tea. they sell antique furniture too.

The cafe was located across the road from the MRT station. The place looked cozy and warm especially when outside was raining. The drink menu was listed on the board, with assorted cakes and pastries on the display shelf.Lemon Drizzle Loaf Cake (S$5.20)The cake was heated when served. It was soft and not too sweet or sour.Merry Trio Latte (S$7)I had the iced version, which was served in a jar. Refreshing drink but could not really taste the distinct flavours in it. There was free wifi in the cafe. I was sitting at a table by the wall, which had a row of power points. There was a note paste on top which allowed customers to use the power point but limited to 15 minutes
4
Staff very helpful and friendly. Free wifi which I had difficulty getting on but the staff sorted it. Able to plug in computer so able to work away. Nice coffee. Unusual decor with additional decorations for Halloween not Diwali. Bucking the trend! I like it. Il be back to enjoy the quiet atmosphere, wifi access and coffee. I'll try the cakes next time.

What a find! Lovely quiche, tarts and pastries! The promo set is 1 savory, 1 coffee and a tart for 17++. The sea salted chocolate yumm, really unexpected delight as it looked quite boring. But a friend insisted I try it. Yummm. The quiche is tasty too, with perfect pastry and filling.Simply.decorated.with.old school furniture and decked with retro quirky antiques for sale. Good place for a catch up.
5
A hidden gem! Small little coffee shop that makes THE BEST coffee and beautiful variety of freshly baked cakes, muffins and all sorts of interesting snacks. The decor is interesting with almost all of it for sale! Nick nacks and old teacups, typewriters etc. Also a bonus is that if you come with your furry dog friend there are two tables outside and they have a fan :)Friendly helpful staff and a relaxed atmosphere
4
The cafe is located in a quiet area in the west of Singapore. Mismatched vintage furniture,crockery and cutlery add to its charm. Items for sale, a tad pricey, hang on the walls. Food is on display, so you can see what you're getting. Sandwiches and croissants were fresh and tasty. Good coffee and very pleasant service. A place to return to.
1
We order chocolate sea salt caramel freppe and mango passion fruit smoothies. It is really hard to swallow cuz the taste is really terrible. Its worse than protein beverage... please do not try this
5
Just had a quick lunch. Artisan bakery, pasta and coffee fair. The outlet at Alexandra Central is great . Highly recommended if you are looking for great pastas, pizzas and pastries at a mid range price and great location and atmosphere. Highly Recommended ðŸ˜‹
4
It's a place where you can have a catch up with your friends and a cup of coffee with different variety of cakes.
3
I loved the setting and the service! The cakes were beautiful to look at and the taste was amazing. Try the carrot cake if you can! If I could just be a little particular, I was a little taken aback by the small sizing portion of the food.
4
With its eclectic decor, you may want to bring home more than the delectable spread of fresh bakes and coffee, maybe a chair or even a table (with a price of course) home?Love the eclectic decor. Depending on the time of the day you choose to go, there maybe a crowd.Tried the Banoffee Tart and Valrhona Sea Salt Caramel Tart that were both so yummy. The coffee was smooth but nothing to rave about.
5
Hidden in a small alley, Carpenter & Cook has always been one of my favourite places to chill and get some work done. With many vintage pieces as its decor and that you can purchase, C&C has a great ambience and vibe. The pastries are lovely. Try the passion fruit ($6.50) and earl grey lavender ($5.20) ones. Absolutely delicious. The coffee's good too! Pay attention to the cutlery used, it adds a nice touch to what you've ordered

We had lunch here in the Alexandra road area after a trip to nearby IKEA. It's not a huge cafe and so we waited for 5-10mins for a table during which time the staff were polite and courteous. They didn't hurry the other guests even though we were not the only people waiting which was nice (at least for those people chatting!)We ordered at the counter and food arrived quite quickly. The pancakes in particular were very good, delicious and good value for money at 12sgd. The rest of the food was all right, a bit salty (we both had sandwiches with chorizo in). Orange juice was pricey at 8sgd, coffee not cheap at 5sgd but good
3
I visited this place with a couple of friends and I found it quite charming. They have good choices for beers pastries and coffee. Prices are at par with most cafes in Singapore. I tried the lemon meringue cake and find it pleasant. The staff was also attentive to our needs.
3
Always wanted to be here because of the environment and I heard their pastry is nice.Environment- the place is really suitable for catch up if you dun like the typical cafe style. They make it a vintage cafe where you can see the old school stuff and yet a bit modern feel.Food - I am a bit disappointed with the cakes they offer. It is quite average. The pastry - croissant is good. Probably the best of all the pastry they offered. They have limited choice so the place is good for tea break. Drink - standard. The coffee is quite nice.

I had been a regular at carpenter and cook when it just opened since is very near to where i stay. They had been increasing their price few times in few months until i give up patronising them. A tea with 1 item will cost me near $20 including GST and servcie charge which i don't think is reasonable in such area. This a neighbourhood area with low rental. A tart in Paul's which is international branding and located in the heart of orchard road cost the same price in similar time and more than double the size, it is equally good too.Recently i had went back and they seem had removed the gst and service charge. They have quite a way of operating business as pricing never be stablized. I will not go back as frequent as before since there are alot new outlets and better ones around.Tarts and quiche are good but not for cakes and muffins.A tart probably serve you one big mouth and thats it. Cakes and muffin are very normal in my own opinion. There is another outlet nearby had better cakes than theirs

Love the earl gray loaf and chocolate scones! It gets sold out quickly. Great place to wind down after a meal. Quite several tea selection and free refills of hot water always with a smile!
5
This little store here has some of the best danishes, pastries and tarts. Their cakes are also amazing. Try the sea salt caramel chocolate tart or the passion fruit meriangue tart.
5
Although this cafe is pretty out of the way, ie best way to get to is by car/taxi, it's worth the hassle/distance to get to. Excellent coffee and pastries in a charming and inviting setting. Absolutely love the vintage-inspired decor! It has, in my opinion, the best lemon tart is Singapore. Sharp and not overly-sweet lemon curd with a cookie-like crust base. I have to resist taking away a couple of tarts every time I visit! The carrot cake, scones and chocolate sea salt caramel tart are nice as well. If you are a coffee drinker, great artisan coffee here. There's a good selection of non-caffeine drinks as well, definitely something here for everyone. I've also bought some lavendar cookies and chocolate sea salt cookies to bring home as well and they are absolutely delightful! Nice place for a get together with friends!

Recommended by a friend and of course boosted by a lot of good reviews from the Internet. Freshly baked and delicious cakes. My favourite got to be their Eat Me loaf of any flavours - particularly earl grey lavender. Coffee is good too. Ambience gives it an extra point. A little far off but definitely worth spending a lazy afternoon there
5
Lovely joint. Been there 3 times. Has wonderful cakes. The lemon drizzle and earl grey lavender loaf cakes and the chocolate tart are absolutely good. The scones are a hit too. Also had the Picnic Sandwich which was such soft and tasty bread with ham and vegetables in between. Love the quaint furniture too. Will definitely return.

Located in Lorong Kilat and requires a bus from the nearest MRT stations are either Clementi or Bukit Batok. It can be a nice chill out place but note that the cafe is free seating thus you might have to share tables as they have long and big round tables. I like the handmade pastries but it can get too sweet or dry for some, my personal opinion :)However, I do like the oven baked Mushroom Quiche, which comes in salad side too! If you are looking for something more filling, you can either go for quiches or sandwiches.For photos of what I've tried, go to http://nkikichua.blogspot.sg/2014/06/carpenter-and-cook-lorong-kilat.htmlThank you

nice cafe with flea market items all around. attracted by internet I took a cab from downtown to go dine. got there after 20 min. nothing to eat except muffins and cakes. had a Parmesan scone the only savory item they had but it was like eating a brick full of sand. the lemon cake was ok. very nicely the staff gave me an extra cake on the house

Looking for a nice place to chill with freshly baked home-made cakes and pastries? Located in Upper Bukit Timah, along the stretch of eateries at Lorong Kilat, you'll find vintage cafe; Carpenter and Cook. There were a variety of cakes and sweets to pick from. For sweets, we tried Caramel Walnut Cheesecake ($7) and Sticky Toffee Walnut Brownie ($6.50). They tasted really fresh like it's just taken out from the oven. Cheesecake was satisfying while the brownie was a little too sweet and dry for me personally. Worthy bites such as Passion Fruit Meringue Tart, Lemon Drizzle Loaf Cake and Banoffee Tart as recommended by the staff. The unique vintage atmosphere, definitely a place to go for with freshly baked pastries and cakes everyday. Perfect setting for a cosy high tea session with your loved ones. Especially over a cup of freshly brew latte. Overall a very nice place to chill with a touch of nostalgic feel

Took a drive down from the zoo and came to this lovely place. The retro/vintage feel really comes across well with the whole deco being made up of (expensive) old school items like typewriters and radios. My favorite is the 1950 chapel chairs!Food wise it was pretty decent. We had the caramel walnut cheesecake and a smashing savory bun, similar to those you see in Tiong Bahru Bakery.Being a wannabe coffee snob, I found my latte a tad too watery. It might be the milk they use. The latte art was quite nice though. Verdict? Great place to chill out with friends as the deco makes for good conversation starters. I'd recommend tea over coffee here. Cakes are a safe bet
