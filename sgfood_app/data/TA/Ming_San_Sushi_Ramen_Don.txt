Excellent service and good variety of food. Easy to find the restaurant and good price. It opens from 11am to 10pm, so you have no problem to find good food around the area.

I love the salada - special sauce. Must order. The rest I would say are pretty common - they are delicious but not extraordinary. A little towards the costly price range but the place is worth a try because the owners are so just friendly and accommodating! However if you are looking for real Japanese deal, you need not travel all the way here.

My husband and I are here in Singapore and found this small casual Japanese diner close to our hotel. We had no idea what to choose from the menu so we had the set meal for two. Everything was delicious and obviously freshly made with quality ingredients. With beers, iced tea and the food it cost 70 Singapore dollars for two of us. Fellow diners were local and we were treated warmly by everyone.

This is a cosy and yet simple eatery. Food is nicely done, I believe is the efforts that put into every dishes. They are starting to serve beers soon, looking forward to it.My workplace is just beside, so I can just drop to have a decent sushi. Service is goodand all the kind people working that is very courtesy and make you felt very welcome.Thanks to Ming San, wife and daughter for making this lovely restaurant!!Do drop by for a meal

Ming San had added more items to its menu and there was some kind of promotion. We had the combo set lunch plus the engawa arburi maki. They were yummy. As usual, the family running the business were very hospital and made us feel very at home.

I am a long time customer with Ming San. The family is always serving simple but homely Japanese dishes. Food is yummy, service is excellent and place is cosy. With some friends visiting Singapore from UK, I have asked Ming San to customise a vegetarian meal for 4 as my friends do not take meat. What he has done is beyond what I could imagine by providing an omakase vegetarian meal that is yummy and so pretty. The pictures speak for themselves.

The chef cum owner and his family make one feel very welcome. Though the menu is limited at this point, it is good enough for such a setting. If you have request and he has the ingredients available, he will accommodate and prepare a dish that is not available. To avoid disappointment( sometimes he is too busy), call up in advance to check if he is able to prepare. I enjoyed eating here.

The menu selection is not extensive but good enough for a meal. Hassle free from ordering, food served and through to payment. Overall, the quality of food is very good, except I felt the size of each sushi a bit smaller than what's usual in a similar restaurant.What is striking about this restaurant is the attentive service, and always with a smile
