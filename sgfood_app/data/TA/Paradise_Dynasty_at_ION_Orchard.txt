My favourite place to come to whenever I'm craving for fried rice!
Shrimp dumplings, xiao long bao, fried rice are must have!!
5
Restaurant manager - Yan Song is friendly and helpful. Quick response to customer enquiry and definitely will come again!
5
The ingredients were of high quality and deliciously prepared.
The food portion was big and we left with extended tummies.
Highly recommended.
5
Good location for lunch.
Good food. And quiet environment for discussion and gathering. Will come again.

The food not bed,but the service so slow They forgot some dishes ordered,To serve the water you must call 4 times
5
Enjoyable meal with friendly service. Portions were generous and I would highly recommend this restaurant. Waitress Chen Xiu was especially friendly.
3
The service was extremely slow the day we went as we also heard the table next to us of waiting very long to be served. We sat in a corner that probably had little visibility when we were calling for the staff's attention. However even after catching their attention and asking what happened to a dish we ordered, it required the 5th reminder before someone came with the dish. The mapo tofu was tasty but the rice we ordered to go with it did not come until we were finished eating. Xiao long bao and the dumplings were okay. They need to up their game in having enough trained staff, otherwise we would just go to Din Dai Fung for xiao long bao and dumplings
5
I had dinner here with my friend on Friday night. The manager Yan Song was very kind and friendly. Our mala fish was too spicy for us and we told him that. He was very proactive and suggested adding some water to dilute the soupbase for us. Excellent dining experience!
3
I have eaten here before and was planning to go elsewhere, but my friends wanted to go to the place with the coloured and flavoured Xiao Long Bau. So we went.Yes, the Xiao Long Bau looks good and is well-presented. This is the visual highlight. But I have certainly had better elsewhere, just not as well-presented. The rest of the meal was actually far better. The chrysanthemum tea on offer was very disappointing. I should have realised that it would not be good when it was sold as a 'free flow refill.'Staff helpfulness? We asked for a window table and were pushed to a small booth, yet for the whole hour that we were there, the window seats remained unoccupied
5
Our team had an 8 (Fa!!!) CNY lunch package! Exhilarating, lovely food. Burp!!! Don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t just read, you got to really try it to burp it! Yes! Service staff are so lovely, caring, and very prompt in attending to your table ad-hoc request/ needs!!! Quick book one for your team coming lunch/ dinner! Oh oh... and it is also a great place to bring your business associates to! What are you waiting for?

This is my 1st chinese new year dining at Paradise Dynasty. Very nice n innovative dishes served. The ambience is good as well as service especially good.
5
Good atmosphere, centrally located, food are good and unique and service are fantastic. These dishes are must order
4
Nice place for cny lunch with colleagues. 8 course menu at $588++ was pretty full for the 10 plus of us. Love the abalone yu sheng and its last course dessert with CNY characters crafted on the pumpkin biscuit.
5
Excellent food and service, especially the soups and sea cucumber dish.
This place is highly recommended for gatherings of any kind, perfect for any occasion.
5
Good spread of food. Timely serving of each dish. Not in a rush to clear table. Waited for us to finish before serving next dish. Fresh idea on new dish of purple buns and dumplings. Ingredients taste fresh especially the fish.
5
First visit.. With colleagues.. Attentive service.. Great taste dumplings.. Handmade desserts. Will come again
5
Nice services with friendly staffs. Food was nice and delicious. Handmade deserts with handmade arts

This is going to be a repetition and I liked very good value and taste in the food here.I recommend Paradise Dynasty to all my friendsGurcharan +65 9270884

This restaurant has great food, great service, and great view! Will definitely be back for more! Must try the scallion noodles!
5
The food was served hot and soooo yummy for my tummy I would recommend this restaurant to all . Price is also reasonable. I like the outside dining üòÄüëå
5
This is my second time visit this restaurant the 8 colourful dumplings was nice & special. Staff at restaurant excellent will recommend all my friends to visit this restaurant.
5
Very much like this restaurant, delicious food, excellent service attitude, and also often do promotions, especially Sichuan boiled fish
I really love it.
4
My favourite dish - the 8 flavours Xiao Long Bao never fails to brighten up the day. Going there with different friends, each one of them has a different favourite. There is still much to discover in the menu it seems.
4
After visiting the restaurant for several times, my favourite dish were the pan fried shanghai pork bun and pan fried pumpkin pastry.The pork bun was crispy with juice trapped inside while the pumpkin pie was soft and chewy.
4
Compared to when it first opened, the menu is now much longer - still primarily Shanghai, Sichuan, and some Teochew dishes with a twist. As a result, meals tend to be heavy. Among the multicoloured xiao long bao, my favs are ginseng, black truffle, crab roe, and garlic. Reasonable pricing, as this is the casual, lower-end eatery of the Paradise Group
2
I expected this restaurant in the heart of Orchard Road to offer reasonable quality of food. Instead, the vegetable(Ginger Kai Lan) was cold when it reached my table. After I pointed it out to the waitress and she took it back to the kitchen, it came back still the same. The pork belly la-mian came with 4 pieces of tough meat, 80% of each piece is pure fat. While they gave me rebate credit (20% for birthday) for my future visit, I doubt I will come back
4
Second time I have been here and have not been disappointed yet. The dumplings are a treat. The other hot dishes on the menu are also very nice. Try the crispy garlic pork rib and also the Szechuan US Marbled Beef in a very spicy broth. Not for the faint hearted.
3
I walked into paradise dynasty hoping for the best after it was recommended by a friend. The first thing that I noticed when I arrived was there was already a plate of food on our table. I asked if it was complimentary, but the server told me it was not, and I would be billed for it. Luckily, the server was able to refund me, and take the bowl off my table, and off the bill. Most of the food came in a moderate 10 to 15 minutes, but the one steamed dumplings that I ordered did not come for 40 minutes plus. When it finally came it was tasty, and just what I expected if not better. The price was another concern, but for the taste, I would say it was ok
4
Lovely dim sums. Great for family and friends gathering.
Try the multi coloured xiao long Bao.
Weekends are crowded. Weekdays are a good timing to be there.
4
Great selection on offer, with great views of orchard road,food and ambience was very nice, seemed a tad unstaffed , but definitely worth a visit
5
Tried 2 new dishes this time - radish pastry and garlic dim sum- both were excellent. Have been visiting this restaurant several times over the past few years and the food has been consistently good. Best dim sum place in Singapore!
3
Not impressed at all. The service took way too long, the food was alright, and the worst part? Having to stand in queue to pay the bill! With just one (and very slow) cashier on duty, it was quite disappointing.
3
My friend treated myself and my husband to this place for dinner on one Monday night, in the 2nd week of November. For a start, we found the wrong place as we got the name confused with another restaurant called Taste Paradise a few shops later. We had hong you chao shou in Mandarin, we also had sweet and sour pork, century eggs with cold tofu, the different types of xiao long bao which looked amazing, the meat cooked in egg yolk otherwise known as sai pang xie in Mandarin. The service was a bit slow, and my friend had to chase the waiter twice to refill our tea, and for the rice. The dessert was boiled pumpkin cake which was not too sweet, and cake in red bean paste which in my view was alright. The only downside is that: as soon as you sit down a small bowl of boiled peanuts and a wet tissue are plonked on the table, both of which you are charged for ($2.50 and $1.50 respectively) but which you are not told about. To be frank it's not really about the money but I think it's a bit underhand
3
I have bad news for this restaurant.....their sister outlet in jakarta is much much better! It's not often that jakarta gets one up on anything from Singapore!The broth in the soup dumplings is a bit bland, no real depth to it, and again the pork bone broth in the noodles lacked a richness that I would expect. All in all it was quite disappointing and I wouldn't return.Also worth mentioning like another reviewer has, as soon as you sit down a small bowl of boiled peanuts and a wet tissue are plonked on the table, both of which you are charged for ($2.50 and $1.50 respectively) but which you are not told about. To be frank it's not really about the money but I think it's a bit underhand
3
As soon as you are seated (which could take a while when it's busy) you get boiled peanuts served. No mention of a price. There are also moist tissues already on the table, which will be charged later. Why?! We didn't ask for them and don't want them because of all the packaging. Granted, the bill was adjusted after we made a comment, but this is a frustrating practice of this restaurant. Feels like you're being ripped off. Food was good though....
4
This review has a good rating because of the long wait for the dishes that be served. But the restaurant is clearly understaffed.We had a hearty meal! All 4 dishes (see pictures) were well executed. The Yang Zhou fried rice portion is big compared to other restaurants, not that I am complaining. I hope the service can be improved for a better dining experience
3
It took 20 mins to get the table at 6-7pm. Very easy to find and nice atmosphere. Wanton Could not be Compared to hong kong's quality but Ok. Soup is great especially putting a little bit of chilly inthe oil. Radish pastry is nice (chef recommended
4
Prompt sitting and got a view of the kitchen. It took a while to get a server but when she did, she did apologize. It took a while to realize that I had to check off what I wanted myself instead of her taking an order. When the food came, it was wonderful although in small portions for the price. When I got my bill, I noticed I was charged for the wet wipe and something that was automatically placed on the table as an appetizer that I didn't know what it was nor did I partake in. When I questioned that, she removed it from my bill. The atmosphere, the decor and serve ware (yes, that matters to me) were great and relaxing
4
We have been dining at Paradise dynasty Ion probably more thanb 50 times, whatever two or 10 people the food and service quality never failed. Good value for money.
5
Fantastic dumblings, Tea, saladroles wih peanutsauce. Service great, looking into the kitchen, nice. Great quality for price!
5
The service is excellent as are the menu choices. They have a set menu option with plenty of choices many of which include dessert. Desserts are wonderful. Presentation of the food is stellar.
2
Honestly, I wish I was having my Xiao Long Bao @ Vivo n not here. Paradise dynasty is one of my favourite but for tonight, having to wait 15 minutes for a table is satisfactory but having eaten n having to Q to pay my bill behind a dozen customers in front is totally unacceptable. There was only one female cashier, so slow that I estimated it took 8 minutes to process one bill. I called for the restaurant manager to address this problem. He did see an immediate need to open another cashier front to resolve this problem. Sure took a longtime though . For sure, this Long Q needs immediate resolution or it's never again for me to visit this venue.
5
This has to be our favorite Chinese restaurant.We were there at 3pm and I wasn't sure if they would be open. They were indeed open and also offered a 50% discount on the dim sum items for Dynasty members from 3pm to 5:15pm. $30 to join and the $30 is deducted from the meal you are having. Great deal.However the main courses here are just fantastic. Beautifully presented and very tasty. If I lived in Singapore I would be here every week. Kelvin our waiter did great job carefully explaining how the discount membership worked. Highly recommended
5
Honestly, my gf and I just love our Paradise Dynasty visits. We go almost every week... a little sad perhaps, as I lived in China and it's not like Singapore is short on Chinese restaurants. But it is just super-delish, Chinese comfort food. Recommendations surely include the Xiao Long Bao, the Chao Mien-varieties, and all manner of veggies such as the spinach vermicelli and the garlic cucumber. Also give their soups a try (pork wanton!
5
Singapore is all about food... but there is also life outside hawker centers. We live outside Asia, and we are always looking for decent Chinese food. Having said that, I must confess that I love this place. The green shoots with minced meat are TO DIE FOR! We also tried the Xiao Long Bao (plain) which were also very good. Then we got La Mian (dry): very good too! Great nice friendly staff, although the payment is a bit slow. Beer is overpriced. We went twice for dinner, and on average we paid 65 SGD (2 pax). We will be back for sure
4
I find consistency in quality of food served at Paradise Dynasty, thus a safe eatery to bring friends.I also like the fact that it's opened throughout the day instead of just for lunch and dinner hours.Believe one can't go wrong with ordering just about anything on the menu in terms of quality. As for taste, it depends on the individual, but it's authentic to what it's supposed to taste like. It's a very safe and enjoyable 'little eat' place to dine in, any time of the day. Service may be a little lacking but acceptable as they must be rather tired by 3pm (my last late lunch visit). Needless to say, the xiao long bao is a given must-have
4
Ordered the following for lunch: Scrambled egg white with dried scallops, Shanghai prawn dumpling, Dan dan mian, prawn pork wanton soup (With taxes, 56SGD for two persons). Can't think of how much better casual Chinese food can get! Service is brisk, place is clean and there's even wifi connection. Have friends over to try this place:
4
This is one of my favourite rstn esp now that they have 50% discount for their dim tsum and their noodles.The food quality is excellent but i have to say the service is very slow. This is probably they have only allocated a few staff to manage the promotional group. I even took my order slip to the attendant after trying to get their attention for 10 min without success. We also ordered a dessert which we thought they forgotten, in which they said they usually served when they had finished serving all the main dishes. But it seemed that they actually didn't keep track due to lack of staff. The quality of the service is the only thing that i have always been disappointed about as i do come to this rstn quite often.
5
Went to the outlet in Changi Airport. Like the noodle and the 8 types of xiao long bao. However the queue is quite long so need to be there early.
3
This restaurant has nice ambience ...
Service varies with different people.
Food is above average.
Can try.
5
Simply delicious 8 color xiaolongbao, tasty wanton noodles and Shanghainese niangao, plus a waiter is full of courtesy
4
On level 4 of Ion Orchard, this restaurant has a tiny entry, which is easy to miss. Once inside though, it's large and bustling with high quality fittings and good service. I had the shanghai Pork buns and pork belly noodle soup. Yum!For the next month they have 50% off half of the menu between 3 and 5.15 - I fluked this and was very happy! They advertise free wifi, but it wasn't working when I was there.
4
I went there recently and what i like the most is the service. The waitress that served me is very courteous and thoughtful. As for the food, sorry to say is not up to my expectation as i taste is quite blunt. Me and my friend stop eating not even when the food is half empty and the rest of the food we just take it slow (almost an hour) and try to finish all as we love food and do not have the habit to waste food. I will come back for the service but for the food.... i will consider as there is plenty of choices
4
Went in mainly for the 8 flavoured soup dumplings, at the same time ordered some noodles.Each flavour of the soup dumplings (Original, Garlic, Ginseng, Cheese, Black Truffle, Foie Gras, Sze Chuan, Crab Roe) all delivered its own distinctive flavours as it was supposed to although I find the flavour of cheese not as prominent. I wouldn't say it is the place for the best soup dumplings but for the experience, it is worth the shot. My favourite amongst the 8 was the crab roe.I also ordered Spicy braised wagyu beef noodles but didn't really like it. Its soup smells like 'Mala' and maybe is which means a lot of chilli oil so if you're someone used to rich broths, this prolly isn't something you should order. Ingredients only consists of a few slices of beef, xiao bai cai and noodles. Overall, just go for the colourful baos
5
While on Singapore i wanted to try their world famous cuisine, i'm a big fan of Dim Sum and the choice of restaurant regarding chinese food i made that day was by far the most accurate. I was ushered to a table with an spectacular view and the waiting staff looked after me and my partner giving great recommendations, their step by step Dim Sum dish is amazing and is a safe bet
4
During our 10 day business trip to Singapore, we decided to try the highly rated Paradise Dynasty restaurant at ION Orchard for Dim Sum. It was very close and convenient to the Marriott hotel where we were staying. It also is much larger than it appears from the outside. While the food was delicious and we would definitely go again, please be aware that their service is very slow (which is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5). Our favorites were the boiled peanuts appetizer (this is $2.60S and provided automatically), Japanese Cucumber (is very salty and garlicky but tastes awesome), Black Bean Pork Crepes (very unique and very good), Pork Dumpling with Chili, Pan-Fried Pork Dumplings, and Shanghai Dumpling. All were delicious. One other item that we had never encountered when traveling is that they do not provide napkins (but you can ask for them), but do charge you .60Singapore for a tissue packet for each person that is provided on the table. Apparently if you don't use them, you aren't charged. They also do a great job of checking that you ordered correctly, that you receive everything you ordered, and that you are billed correctly. More so than any other restaurant in Singapore
5
Came here for dinner. Luckily we came at around 4pm cos by the time we left, there was a long queue outside.We sat outdoor cos all the indoor seats were filled.Ordered the following:Braised bamboo shoots: nice cold dishÂ§´Â¶ªËÇ∫ÁâáÔºöDunno the name in English. Unlike the ones I had eaten. The ingredients are braised first. Not too badDumpling noodles: HUGE portion. Could hardly finish even when I was sharing with mum (attached pic from other source)Radish pastry: OMG this is heavenly. The pastry simply fall apart when you eat it. And the radish is so light.Áï•ÊâìÊªöÔºö Did not have the melt in the mouth texture as the one I tried in BeijingWill come again soo
4
The restaurant is located at ION level 4 at unit 12A. The main looked so small, but you are surprised when you see their seating capacity. First you will see their open concept kitchen, follow by the dining area. Their foods served are really delicious, but a bit lack on their service quality. Must always call them in to refill our tea pot. Coz we are with our clients for the CNY lunch. Overall rating for everything is still considered good.
4
Food was to die die for. Especially the schezuan chicken. The long bao was pretty good too. Harsh was very helpful and we would definitely come back for a second round. So good we decided to take their membership card for 10% discount.
5
Consistency- great quality and service again and again. The szechuan pepper soup with chilli oil and fish is mind altering in all the right ways, a strong recommendation!!!
3
We came as a couple and the waiting was about 30 mins so we think that the food will really worth the queue but I got to say that its not worthy at all. Thw signature dish was the dumplings but non of us like it.We ordered others chinese but they were very average too.Most crucially, the price is like a 5 star standard which its no
4
The variety of coloured and flavoured xiao long bao added a nice twist - I tried the garlic flavor which were very nice. Overall, the food was of a high standard, with a large selection, and the restaurant had a nice ambiance. I would also say that it was good value for money. I would definitely come here again
4
This is an elegant restaurant with polished welcoming service and very high quality food. Every dish was flawless but particularly noteworthy was the delicacy of the dim sum -- from the skins on the dim sum to the perfection of the fillings. Every dish was tasty and memorable and this is a restaurant to which one would gladly return
4
We ordered a lot of dishes as it was a company lunch, so I can't remember every dish that was ordered. Still, I thought the food was pretty good in general, and very flavourful. There were many dishes that originated from different parts of China, and according to my Chinese colleagues, they tasted pretty authentic.The atmosphere was pretty nice too - not too noisy, and decorated quite exquisitely. The service staff were knowledgeable on the food items, so that was a huge relief.I particularly enjoyed the colourful Xiao Long Bao, which came in 8 different flavours, namely Original, Black Truffle, Cheese, Crab Roe, Foie Gras, Garlic, Ginseng, and Szechuan (spicy). There was a Shanghainese dish with rice cakes and preserved vegetables which I enjoyed too.Definitely worth the visit, but do come with more people so that you can order more dishes and share the costs
4
I have been a few times and always very good. The service is efficient, the restaurant is very clean, the chefs are visible and the meal very good. The dishes arrive as they are cooked. Have only ever been for lunch and whilst busy I never had to wait for a table.
5
Lovely ambiance for a family gathering.The staff were professional and accommodating to our request to change to a larger table when we had a last minute additional pax.Food was served very promptly and up to standard and I was also pleasantly surprised with a plate of longevity buns as it was my birthday that day (I guess they got to know about it from my membership data).Will definitely be back again real soon : 
2
Went there on Sunday with some friends for xiao long Bao, the food and service was fine except that th the air conditioning system was grossly inadequate. The air in the restaurant was stale and stuffy. I feel especially for the staff dressed in coats or suits. They were sweating profusely. It just spoilt my dining experience so much that I had run out twice midway through the meal for some fresh air. To blame the building's ac system for this just doesn't cut it because the ac system was designed for certain capacity. In any case, the management of the restaurant should have taken proactive steps to ensure a decent environment for customers and staff. It's just unacceptable
4
You can't go wrong in choosing this Chinese dumpling restaurant. It's busy and buzzing, with a display kitchen and agreeable staff (mostly). Good for vegetarians but great for omnivores. We like to sit outside but you do have to choose your time of day. Try the Sichuan chicken. While it lacks the full dose of Sichuan pepper, it's still a great dish.
5
Simply awesome food. The signature dumplings are remarkable and worth trying. The Szechuan port was fantastic, spicy at first until the numbing takes effect, then incredibly tasty. Service was good. Worth a visit.
4
Perfect spot to try chinese shechuan cuisine.
Dim sum are fresh and surprising taste from Fois gras , Pepper , cheese or truffle...
Excellent pasta and soup.
Great staff and nice atmosphere..
A most go .
5
Best XLB I've ever had. Don't bother with the fancy flavored ones - the original are the best. The rest of the menus was great too - and what an impressive room!
5
No msg on the food, the assorted dumplings come in a variety of flavors that run a whole range of tastes. The xiao long bao comes complete with instructions on the sequence to eat. Service s excellent as wellz
4
Boyfriend and I love their original xiao long bao and each of them is well made, you can drink the soup in it. Boyfriend always order the zha Jiang mian as it is flavourful and the serving is generous (I think 2 ladies could share one if you don't take much carbo like me). Shanghai pan fried pork bun is tasty too, the exterior is crispy and interior of bun is filled with savoury pork filling.
3
This is a great place to try fresh hand-made steamed or fried Chinese dumplings. The other dishes I tried on my recent visit included spicy chicken and hot & sour soup. All of these were excellent. That is the good news.On the other hand, there are several things about this restaurant that are not so good. I arrived about 11:15 am, shortly after the restaurant opened. Apparently, the air conditioning had not been on until then. The restaurant was relatively warm and humid, which is surprising as it is inside of a luxury shopping mall.The other issue was the service. It was painfully slow. I watched one family at another table constantly trying to wave a server over to get serve. For my part, I waited patiently. They brought my beer and a chilled mug. I decided to wait until food arrived for my beer. By the time the first food item arrived, the mug was no longer chilled, and the can of beer was tepid. In all, for soup, dumplings, and the chicken, it took about an hour to get served. The dumplings I could understand, as they are freshly hand-made. But they came first!I had another experience which was new for me. The server seated me at a table for two, by myself. The table was separated by about a foot of space from the next table over. He asked if I wanted tea, and I said "Yes," receiving a pot of tea relatively quickly. The tea is not free. You pay for the pot for the table. While I waited for my first food item to arrive, the server seated two men at the table next to mine. After a few minutes, one of the men reached over and told me that I wouldn't mind if they had some of my tea. Since I paid for my tea, I did mind. I waved down a server to ask for a new pot of tea, since the two men at the next table over had taken mine. The server tried to suggest that we were together. I convinced her that we were not, and she eventually brought me a new pot of tea. I guess the two men next to me got a free pot of tea, from my bill.I won't go back here
4
had lunch there with friends. The Xiao Long Bao is excellent. Try the truffle ones. Most of the other doshes are very good too. The dumplings in spicy sauce, the cold chicken, beef slices, the red bean desert ( pastry). Excellent setting, great service. If you are in the area , go there. The food is worth it as well as the experience
4
Came here for the coloured Xiao Long Bao and was not disappointed. The meal was delicious!The service was good too. You can just decide what you want to order and pass the waitress a slip with the numbers on. You can just keep adding as you feel that you'd like more courses.The setting is lovely in the Mall - we sat outside on the balcony which was nice
4
Visited this restaurant on a saturday evening and had to wait about 15-20 mins for a table as we had no reservations. Excellent automated Q system, great way to handle crowds on peak timing. Was there in a group of 3 and we ordered a few dishes and our soups.All orders was taken promptly as well. Servers were attentive and helpful and though it was a busy night, you could see that all servers worked systematically and still paid attention to service. Our food arrived shortly after but I had suspected that there might have been a mix up on delivery of dishes as a few servers came to our table and asked to double check our dishes served but none of them were rude and was apologetic that they were interrupting our mealsGreat place to visit
4
The location and ambience is nice. We had taken some friends and family along and they all loved the soup dumplings that are really special and tasty.We found only two vegetarian choices - one was some dumplings that are delicious and the other was a bao that was nice with some spicy sauce.The service was average and a bit strange
3
A nice location with good Chinese food. We had good dumplings and typical local food and we were pretty happy with the choice. The location is nice with average service.
5
wow , I want to come back again . I think they have indian chef and when i ordered masala chicken (which I have tasted in India they offered me almost the same taste.
5
The noodle here is much better than other Ramen i have tried so far. Xiaolongbao is also not bad.. parking at ion is abit expensive though
4
This visit was my fourth in three years = at least once every time I visit Singapore. I stay in the area, so it's a short walk to get here, or ride up the elevator from the MRT. I come here for their signature dish XLB (xiao long bao = soup dumplings). I like their's better than those at Din Tai Fung next door. The dumplings are always little bundles of delectable joy. This time I tried the spicy ones - yum! In addition to the XLB, I had the Szechuan spicy fried chicken and the green beans with minced pork. Both excellent. I have eaten here between 18-1900, so it is not busy yet. Service has been quick and courteous. I will be back for the XLB during my next visit to Singapore
3
Their Sze chuan food is on point and I love most of their dishes. Only thing I don't like is if I get there earlier than my rest of the table, they would not sit me first!! Why? Also if they don't take reservations and I am slightly earlier, why can't they sit me first so I can order a drink and some appetiserz to start
5
I was pleasantly surprised when a friend brought me here for dinner this week. Even though I had coffee earlier, the menu still worked up an appetite for me (I'm a sucker for Chinese food anyway). There were so many things I wanted to try but there only the two of us. The dry gungpao diced chicken is a fiery treat and it tasted so good it was actually addictive. The consistency of their noodles was perfect too. I'm definitely coming back. Oh the ambience is great too while not being too pricey!
4
The highlight of this restaurant would have to be their xiao long baos. Be it their signature 8 flavour xiao long bao or their original one, they are all absolutely delicious. We tried their noodles and fried rice as well. Both dishes tasted nice. We had ginger soup with black sesame ball for dessert. The ginger soup was pretty concentrated but was nice nonetheless. Always visiting when in Singapore and it barely disappoints
5
We went there for Xiao Long Bao twice. Both times, our bills came to around $60 just on xiao long bao for two people. It's a little pricey but the atmosphere and service is wonderful. Definitely worth joining the Member's Club if you plan on going more than once, since the signing bonus is that it takes $30 off your bill as long as you've spent more than $30
5
Right away, we knew that this was going to be a great experience. Great service, fast serving time and great food... The Xiao Long Bao was great and so was their noodles. You can see the food being prepared while waiting and it adds to the experience. Props to the staff who regularly go around and inquire if the food was prepared to your satisfaction. Thanks for the great time..

The queue at the sister restaurant Taste Paradise was way too long and just a melee outside.The Paradise Dynasty had a much more helpful display of table size and queue length. The brief 20min wait was worth it. Nice table for two with curtains in a secluded location near the kitchen. A view of dedicated white hatted chefs was visible through the glass partition.The xian bao was nice and the house special "La Mian" very tasty. Our favorites were the egg fried rice together with the river shrimp with cashews and the crispy sweet and sour pork. Execution was excellent with just the right flavors. My partner declared "the best Chinese I have had in a long time".Yes it was expensive at $80 including a beer but Singapore isn't a cheap city and this was quality food.We would certainly be back

Omg! Food here while pricey was soooo worth it...it was soooo good and out of the ball park good that even saying that seems to be an understatement. truly an amazing experience.
5
Always order the xiao long bao, onion noodle, guo tie.
We come here for normal meals as well as special occasions.

Was walking across the ION Shopping Mall and was attracted by this place that is serving Chinese cuisine.
It is a large restaurant but relatively cosy.
Staff efficient.
Food can be considered as good but enough for a lunch during shopping time.
3
Reasonable food, reasonable prices and CBD location. I was expecting higher prices given its location in Ion Orchard. The food was OK but I did get a shock with the restaurant charging patrons for towels....now that's a first!!
5
Ordered many different dishes, the wontons and dumplings are superb, as were the noodles in spicy dan Dan peanut sauce.
Worth a visit, might be a queue so book in advance
4
It's not your usual dimsum place. This is what I would picture a Chinese Emperor‚Äôs dining room would look like only with more tables, chairs, and people. Poached Sliced fish in Szechuan Chili Oil. This was a promotional offer during our visit so I ordered it. It looked nice on the photo and true enough, it did not disappoint. I would definitely come back for this. I don‚Äôt think I can say the same about the dimsum despite this place being known for their dimsum. I still think the dimsum crown belongs to the more famous dimsum place. But if it‚Äôs your first time, you should try their assorted xiao long bao. It‚Äôs nothing special but it‚Äôs worth a try. The food is not bad and I never thought I‚Äôd see in a posh dimsum restaurant. You‚Äôll have to see it for yourself

~Paradise Dynastry is at ION's 4th floor, right in front of the escalators~came in Nov lunch with team and in Jan dinner with family, yes it's just that good-the cold Spiced Beef Shank is a specialty worth the taste-Sweet & Sour Fish comes a close second to Manhill's YUMz-super Radish Yam Pastry you gotta try this 2x YUMz-the dumplings with soup "XIAO Long Bao" YUMzwith the team we ordered a ton of everything to taste and except for the shocking mala (dry spicy hot) dish that was swimming in oil (guys really don't order it) everything was super... will be bac

We never miss dining at the best hot pot restaurant in Singapore. Service is superb,and the variety of ingredients for the sauces make the hot pot so delicious. You may ask the efficient and expert waitresses to mix up the sauces. The choices are endless and my favorites are the fresh prawn balls and fresh prawn or squid noodles, shrimp dumplings, the soy bean skin and the spam!
5
Oh my goodness what a great place to eat! A friend brought me here and I'm glad as may not have found it. Located in the rather gorgeous Ion Orchard shopping mall on the 3rd floor it has a heavenly menu!First thing we ordered was the selection of dim sum, around 8 arrive, you eat them in a certain order and they range in flavours from foie gras to black truffle, cheese, garlic and shezhuan. Absolutely amazing! Also had chicken noodles, spinach with garlic and pork buns. The bacon and scallion was pretty rubbish though, too much dough. Also had a spicy fish broth, not though even the least spicy is spicy and it's massive.Both had tea which is refilled.Lovely setting, nice, quick service (although a bit of a queue to pay) but I would definitely go back. Lovely lovely!

I enjoyed dinner here alone and sat in the outside dining area. The restaurant was very busy but the service was crisp all the same. The food was all fresh and delicious. A few quirky things - I had almost no interaction with anyone; the two people I tried to speak to (aside from the hostess) did not speak english (the official language of Singapore) and ordering is done by writing times on a form like in a sushi bar. This was fine - ensured no mistakes - but lacked the helpfulness of a wait person making recommendations. Other quirky thing: They serve you peanuts (the wet soft kind - new to me) without asking if you want them and charge you for them; not expensive but I was surprised. They also place a packaged wet nap on the table without asking if you want it and charge you for it. In both cases I assumed they were included until I got the bill. I had the 8-variety xiao long bao, french green beans, dan dan mien, and mango pudding. It was all delicious
4
Served quicly, good service, the food was really nice even if it was NOT the best "xiao long bao" in Singapore ;)
But I really recommand for the place, we ate outside and it was very comfortable.
4
Quality dim sum, valued pricing, yummy dishes, great view of Orchard Road, impeccable service, quiet corner,
5
This restaurant makes the best dumplings ! Very fresh. Made on site. The noodles are also very good. I had the Dan Dan noodles and chicken dumplings. Yum! Wish we had this restaurant at home. I would be a regular.
4
Finally got a chance to try the assorted xiao long bao. Rather tasty but skin a bit too thick. The surprised find was the wanton soup and stir fried noodle. The soup was rich and full of flavours. Worth a try.
5
We dined her for lunch whilst on holiday & the food was so good we returned the next day for so more choices that we were keen to try. the kitchen is being glass so you can look in & see all the chefs making the dumplings, hand made noodles etc.. the food was delicious. Well worth a visit
5
We had a very late lunch in Paradise Dynasty (around 2pm) on a Monday so there wasn't any queue at all! Ordered their original flavored Xiao Long Baos, their Truffle Xiao Long Baos and their Foie Gras Xiao Long Baos and other typical Chinese restaurant food like fried rice, sweet and sour pork, hot and sour soup, etc.This wasn't my first time. So I knew what I was ordering. It was my family's first time. They weren't so sold on the Foie Gras Xiao Long Bao. They said it had a funny taste. I didn't try it anymore but the first time I went there I ate that and thought it was good. Servings are just right. I asked the waitress if I overordered and she said I ordered just right, good thing I cancelled 2 main dishes because we would have all been full to the roof. Trust your own instincts!They'll offer you a discount card, which at first I shrugged off because I don't live in Singapore, but after computing it, it turned out I would have saved alot since the first time use gives 25% off. Consider this if you're a big group. I saved around $100 -200 SGD nett after paying for the fee for the loyalty card.Food is great all the time. Just need to pick better for the flavored xiao long baos. Truffle and original flavored ones are good though
4
To me this place is one of the place to go in Singapore. It's well located, quality is good and price decent.Every time I go to Singapore, I have to have my Dynasty.I dont like the fact that we have to queue out but that is the way it works
4
We turned up in this mall starving only to find that the food court was closed due to refurbs so decided to visit this place called the paradise dynasty. Let me tell you, amazing food and at great great value. The pork dumplings were delicious as were the prawn dishes and crispy Spring rolls. Downside is that they charge for towels and cold water (which seems to be tap water) which are provided to you on the table. You would think that these are free (like any restaurant you eat at) but unfortunately no. The manager was very helpful and suggested that we become a member to qualify for 25% discount when you sign up with the group. This option works out cheaper especially if you are a large party and the bill came to over 200 SGD!I would def recommend this, if you like the food from ping pong then you will like this! Beautiful decor inside sort of reminded me of the top restaurants around Canary Wharf in London
4
I was there for its famus color dumplings, it tastes very different and very interesting. I will say they all taste good, some better than other. Only think you have to know before you go there is... they charge you everything they give you! Tea, yes most of the restaurant charge you for it, but not the wet napkins .... they also serve you a soft peanuts appetizer that you think it's complimentary but not and it's $3.50 SGN for that
5
The restaurant has beautiful contemporary interiors and a wide array of dimsum and other dishes. We ordered a variety of dishes and the Xiao long Bao was very interesting since they had different variants like truffle, crab roe, and even foie gras. I loved the classic Xiao long Bao and their other dimsum.
4
Dim sum selections with good taste. Only need to be aware they could put you under the aircond blow. When make a reservation make sure you don't get that unfavorable table location.
4
Nice and kids friendly restaurant.
Good food especially the Xiao Long Pow of different varieties.
Love the spicy dishes.
5
Great food at reasonable pricing. This restaurant has a wide variety of noodle and dim sum dishes. You can sit outside and inside (very cold). It seems to make sense to become a member in order to get discounts.
4
Food is so delicious and the price that not expensive for the nice restaurant in city . Walking into ION Orchard shopping to the 4 floor and you will see the waiter welcoming to you
5
One of my Favourite Restaurant while in Singapore.. I Love The Xiao Lung Pao and Many dim sum dishes. But many times i come here mostly we must queue because it's so crowded. For the price is reasonable me and my family like it
5
I like the hot&spicy noodle, beef in chili oil.
Marble beef stir fired also great and if you finish your meal with mango pudding. It will be a perfect choice.
3
We went there, 4 adults and 2 children with high hopes. We all love dim sum and apart from the lovely foie gras and also the truffle dumplings the rest of our meal was not outstanding. It was good, mind you, but the fried rice was very average, and served close to being cold which the kids loved, but not the adults, the wan ton soup was excellent but the service was frankly bad. Dishes were brought to us which we had not ordered, others had been forgotten and came to the table too late to be appreciated.As it is part of a large chain of restaurants we shall give Paradise Dynasty another chance in another of their restaurants
4
Beautiful restaurant on the inside, when entering you can see the kitchen and all the chefs cooking, which makes you feel confident about their job. Dim sums here are a must have, fantastic flavours and the presentation is super as well. The pork soup is nice and the tea they serve to drink tastes very good. What didn't surprise me were the fried mushrooms as they were a bit cold when served on the table.Overall, if I get to visit SGP again, I will definetely take a meal here once again
5
Located in the up market ION Orchard, Paradise Dynasty is one place where you will be doing yourself a huge favour by visiting & experiencing.Great place with fast service and excellent food that's good value. The dimsum are awesome, love the chili dumplings and chives. Do try the crystal pork as well
5
I have been visiting this place for Business lunch since 2012, always satisfy with the quality of the food and the superb service. having visited several of its franchise outlet, I prefer ION orchard outlet for it's large space & superb services.Noodles range from $8.80 to $14, the portion is huge and less oily compared to the usual chinese outlet. Xiao long bao (meat dumpling) is always juicy. I will order the 7 flavour meat dumpling , if I am dining with foreign clients.Warning : this outlet has LONG queue during meal time, take a number and wait for 20-30min
5
Try their colourful XLB and original XLB! It's great! The other dishes taste good, too. However, the service is quite slow.
5
The colorful signature dumplings are a must. Drunken chicken also was great. One of the best restaurants in Singapore. Very crowded.
The service was good and efficient. Well managed professional restaurant that still treats you well
4
Delicious xiao long pow and other main dishes. We came here for dinner. Can be a bit hit and miss with service. We ate here twice in 4 days!
4
Had lunch with local friends, and were treated to an excellent spread of small dishes and dim sum. Service was prompt and the over all impression was really good. Would definitely recommend Paradise Dynasty to anyone looking for good Chinese food around Orchard Road.
5
We came here for our usual gathering. The 3 of us ordered fried rice, Xiao Long Bao, salted cucumber and Sichuan Shui Shui Zhu Yu (Spicy fish slices). This is a must go place if one enjoyed spicy food. And we love the colorful xiao long bao. I will definitely come back for more
5
Had lunch with a bunch of lawyers on a Saturday. Tried their XLB fusion - they also have instructions what to try first, and so on... I thought its one of those cheesy gimmicks but the taste varieties nails the spot. Chinese dishes are also prepared fresh and delectable that makes you want to think bad about Din Tai Fung. Consider also waiting in line and some (few waits/ "not that lousy") service when seated.
3
The reviews on Yelp were really good but my experience was just ok. I ordered the cucumber salad (refreshingly good), xiao long bao (flavored) and the sweet sour soup. The XLB was ok - the flavors actually weren't as good as the plain ones and there's not much soup in them. The soup was ok - nothing to write home about. The cucumber appetizer was actually the best part of the meal. They charge you for everything and for me, I would rather have eaten at another hawker centre where the food is much better and more authentic. I went here one night because it was across from my hotel and I needed a quick bite.
3
I visited on a weekday. The mall was not very crowded. I was seated quickly and ordered two items. My first item did not arrive. After a couple of promises that it would be there soon, eventually on the third try they rushed and delivered it. It was a simple dumpling. Something must have gone wrong because everything else seemed to work well. The food was quite good.Another odd thing was that to pay the bill I had to take it to the cashier at the exit. There was a long line of people waiting to pay. I had to ask the hostess for help and they expedited my paying. It seems odd that you have to wait a long time to pay and leave the restaurant. Some people seemed to be paying with groupon vouchers, and that was taking a long time
3
We were a party of 8 when we dined at Paradise Dynasty. Been eating at this restaurant for years , although the food particularly the XLB & Noodles are exceptional, service is lousy and slow. Had to follow up orders for more than an hour before the meals arrived. Would think twice before eating at this restaurant again as the servers and the food service are rather slo
5
Located in the Ion Orchard Mall, I don‚Äôt think Paradise Dynasty takes reservations. We went for lunch on a weekend, and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, which isn‚Äôt bad at all for a popular restaurant at peak time. The dark and gilded d√©cor is meant to exude opulence ‚Äì chandeliers in the middle of the restaurant hang on either side of a golden dragon on the ceiling. You pass the open kitchen as you proceed to the tables, and watching the chefs twisting, stretching and folding dough into strands of lamian noodles is fascinating.The speciality is Xiao Long Bao, and we tried the sampling basket that comes with 8 flavours ‚Äì original, ginseng, foie gras, black truffles, crab roe, cheese, garlic and Szechuan. It was so good that we ordered another basket!! Be aware that there is a recommended sequence in which the XLB should be eaten so that all the flavours can be enjoyed; don‚Äôt just randomly pop them into your mouths like we did. Natural ingredients such as carrot and spinach are apparently used to create these multi-coloured dumplings. The lamian with spicy dumplings are really good, as was the Szechuan style deep friend chicken. The majority of the (way too many) other dishes we ordered were good.While the food is really good, the service was pretty bad. Catching the staff‚Äôs attention really requires effort, and some of them will pretend not to notice your desperate gesturing while walking past!! That was a big disappointment, considering the restaurant isn't cheap.The food at Paradise Dynasty is great, and I‚Äôd definitely recommend a visit ‚Äì but be prepared for the poor service. Having said that, the food is good enough to endure the poor service
4
Visited on a weekday evening and it was quite crowded. We love the original xiao long bao. The wanton ramen was not too bad except that the soup is a tad too salty. The bittergourd pork rib soup is tasty.
5
Paradise dynasty serves tasty Chinese dishes for very reasonable prices. The pork pancakes and the minced pork noodle dishes are personal favourites. I will often end up going to PD several times a month, it's that good.
4
The dumplings were delicious, they offered Xiao Long Baos of eight different styles in different colours - from the original, foie gras, black truffle to cheese, Sichuan, etc. The outdoor seating was comfortable with a great view. So creative!!
4
The food was delicious but the service and environment were a bit stuffy for us. Definitely would recommend a visit but don't anticipate a warm welcome.
3
The food was ok. I tried the foie gras xlb and I couldn't really taste the foie gras. So, it wasn't really worth the cost for me. I love foie gras too, so I was disappointed. I also had a noodle soup, which was ok. Nothing special. FYI, if you don't want to pay for the wet napkin or the snack already sitting on the table, then have them remove it when you are seated
5
This is my 2nd visit to Paradise dynasty in this outlet at 1KM mall.I love their xiao long bao, better than the ones at Din Tai Fung or Crystal Jade's XLB restaurant.They also have the unique colourful & flavourful xlb. The best standout ones are the foie gras & black truffles. For me the original one is also my all time favourite.The radish pastry is incredibly nice. Crispy from the outside, soft & light texture of radish fillings. Dan dan noodle is also one of the better ones compared to the 2 other brand restaurants mentioned.They staffing are very well trained and informed. They care to informed and check for service. I would definitely return again to try out other dishes!
4
Hosted my sister and brother in law to a nice meal at paradise dynasty in ion. So far compared to other outlets it seems that ion's outlet looks more grand. Price range was reasonable and we had a very good meal. It is a nice place to host family or guest to a dinner.
4
This place is definitely worth a visit if you are in the area. Make sure you order the radish appetizer..it sounds strange but tastes incredible! We went back so we could have more two nights later. Dumplings are great, pretty much any main course is awesome too. Bring a bunch of people and share loads for the best experience. The drive was sub par at best so if they work on that they could get 5 stars easy.
3
With the introduction of renewing your membership at only S$3 it is a treat for your next redemption as you gather points in $ value. But alas! I had s hard time at Paradise Inn whose tired staff make you wait while she clear whatever she is doing and show no concern of her bad explanation in Mandarin as to how the scheme work. She is far from the Manager who paid $10 on my behalf and I am a stranger! Being myopic she needs retraining as the Management thought deeply into this promotion.Food at Paradise Dynasty is average and pricey as compared to its competitor as the taste of crab siow long pau didn't linger and make me crave for more. The pan fried meat dumpling was ordinary too.The meatball soup was light and full of flavor as like the good smiling service Joanne Tan gave. Lots of flavorful appetisers that delight me are the beef shank, drunken cold chicken and different variety of noodles.The signature siow long pau of 8 didn't impress me at all
3
The food is similar to din tai Fung but the service is AWFUL. it took an age to give our order, one dish was delivered wrong, it was really hard to get another beer and then the queue to pay was at least 10 minutes. It rather spoilt the meal.
4
Known for its Xiao Long Bao, its a must try. Service is good but somethings you have to wait to be seated as this place is usually pack. Good to come early to get a seat.
5
I love the Dim Sum here. Reasonable price at a central location. Each basket is around 3 to 5 SGD, taxes and service charge excluded. They serve a mean Salted Egg Custard bun, so do get that.
4
Paradise dynasty is known for its sumptuous xiao long bao. The service is great and the food is good. It is not too pricey either. Good for small gatherings.
5
nice restaurant with good Chinese food, friendly service staff,
highly recommended..................
1
The door witch refused to give me a table until my friend arrived...all I wanted was a beer waiting whilst friend was in bathroom...just rubbish...been before and not worth the crap door witch rudeness.....don't go
4
Excellent (10 types) Xiao Long Bao, all made freshly in the open kitchen. The fresh noodles and other dumplings are also very good.Order as required as everything comes when readyGood choice on the a la carte menu if anyone wants other dishes... No bookings, just rack up and wait for a table-it won't take too long even when busyIf you don't want the provided pickles / peanuts send them back as you'll be charged anyway. Regulars can register as a member and get 10% off the bill (carried forward
4
I have visited Paradise Dynasty - Legend of Xiao Long Bao, probably more than 30 times and I must say the quality of food is very consistent. Everytime I dine there, I will never miss the Êµ∑‰∏≠ÂÆù, which is a cold seafood dish consisting of squid, prawns and jellyfish tossed in an extremely appetising sauce! My dad likes the La Mian with Pork Ribs, and I always have some of the soup because it tastes amazing. Some other dishes I often order include other appetisers such as Drunken Chicken, Chilli Wantons (Á∫¢Ê≤πÊäÑÊâãÔºâ, and the Stir Fried Scallion Beef. The queue can get quite long during weekends and dinner time on weekdays, so be sure to arrive early if possible. They also tend to not let you in until your whole party has arrived, so try to arrive together as early as possible, to avoid long waiting times
4
We were meeting friend at Woodlands, and chose Paradise Dynasty I'm Causeway Point mall as an easily recognised and convenient destination. We got a table immediately as it was still fairly early and ordered our favourites - siu long bao (soup dumplings), la mien (hand-pulled noodles), pan fried pork buns, wontons and a cold vegetable dish. Dessert was the rich and more-ish sweet red bean pancakes. All the dishes were up to expectations with quick, friendly service. If you're new to siu long bao, do order the mixed set to try out all the flavours. (Our firm favourite remains garlic!
5
They offer different taste of xiao long bao and they are all absolutely amazing. I would say the best selection of xiao long bao in Singapore. In addition they offer good service and some other tasty dishes such as the pan fried buns, pork noddle soup or pumpkin cake
5
On my last day in Singapore, we had lunch with a friend who brought us to Paradise Dynasty at Ion. Though it was close to 2pm when we got there, it was still full. The food was excellent. The dishes my host ordered were all good. They had colored ciao long bao which was very interesting. Service could be faster but all in all , a very enjoyable meal! Will go back if given the chance
4
My friend took me out there after a long day in office.. Excellent food.. Love the ambience.. Very crowded even for Monday.. And head this place gets very crowded during weekends.. Reserve in advance.. Must visit
3
Better than the Hawker food courts for sure, with better sanitary conditions. Crowded, reasonable price.
5
Went hear on advice not really having been in Singapore for more than 20 years.
We were not disappointed, the food was really good and the restaurant was comfortable, reflecting its location in a shopping mall.
5
Make a point of seeking out this restaurant. It must seat about 300 people with super views out over the water but the real star is the food - my goodness ....... the Dim Sum is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G.There is a huge amount of choice on the menu and you have a very clear view of the food being prepared as the kitchen is glass fronted for customer viewing.There are plenty of staff to serve you and the level of service is very very good.This restaurant also has another restaurant at Singapore Airport so please do miss this.There is no doubt that I would seek out this restaurant again when I am in Singapore - it really is that good
5
This is the best Chinese restaurant in Singapore and comparable to what you can find in Hong Kong.The food was so good I ate here three times during my three-day stay in Hong Kong. I had wonton noodle soup, shrimp dumplings, siu mai and congee with fish ball. I had to stop by here to get some food to take back to my hotel after going to Paulaner Singapore and experiencing the terrible food there. The congee was 100 times better than German sausages! The spicy chilli oil was excellent and complemented everything really well. The service was fast and efficient.While other restaurants nearby were all empty, this restaurant was always full all day long. This was definitely the highlight of my trip! I was impressed with every aspect of this restaurant
4
Had the sweet and sour pork, stir fried beef with mushrooms and long beans with minced pork. All the dishes were great and very satisfying. Prices were very reasonable. Restaurant interior was nice and clean. Definitely will be going here everytime i crave for chinese foo
4
Paradise is known for flavored, colored soup-filled dim sum, which are both fun and delicious. Other tasty selections are the vegetable vinaigrette, spicy seafood soup, stir fry beef with vegetables, and fried crispy fish. Everything we ate was tasty and served hot. Quiet, peaceful restaurant for a relaxing meal, but very busy at peak hours. Consistently good over the years.
4
Our friend took us to this restaurant where we had their special coloured Dim Sum, belly pork and fungus, presentation was excellent and taste divine. The coloured dumplings had juice with meat inside so you had to bit the top or place the whole dumpling in your mouth otherwise you could spill it over yourself. The belly pork was wonderful and the fungus with chilli was good too. You order by ticking a menu card along side what you want good idea so there is no misunderstanding. Staff were not the most friendly of people but carried out their job professionally. The food arrived quickly, and the Chinese tea was in plentiful supply. Decor was nicely done and the place was busy. Would enjoy going there again.
4
Go early especially on weekends. They give you 1.5 hours when seated. The food was all very tasty and unique. The 8 style XLB has cheese, truffle, spicy and other flavors that make it different. The original was still the best and all had soup in them unlike other places. The Fried Dumpling wasn't very good. The cucumbers, spicy noodle soup, fried pork chops, and pork with preserved vegetables were all really really flavorful and good. Try the dates too. Definitely a group spot so you can share dishes.
4
Most things seem to be located in malls in Singapore, and Paradise Dynasty at ION Orchard is no exception.The restaurant is ornately decorated in black and gold. Despite its appearance, the restaurant has a fairly relaxed atmosphere.There is a semi-open kitchen concept where you can see workers making the different kinds of dumplings.Seemingly famous for their colored Xiao Long Bao, they come in 8 different flavors and colors. They are original, ginseng, foie gras, black truffle, cheesy, crab roe, garlic and Szechaun.Although they suggest eating the Xaio Long Bao in the above order, we did not.The original, has a nice semi-thick skin with a bit of chew. There is ample soup with a nice porky filling.The ginseng has a sharp ginseng flavor that will certainly wake up your taste buds.The foie gras has an earthy taste, but no discernable foie gras flavor in my opinion.The black truffle also has an earthy mushroom quality, but again the funk from black truffle is hard to distinguish.The cheesy is certainly that. Although it doesn‚Äôt hit you in the face with cheese flavor, it sort of sneaks up on you and lingers for quite some time.The crab roe has a nice seafood salinity that dances across your tongue. The roe definitely comes through.Another in your face dumpling is the garlic. Sharp and to the point, a breath mint is definitely needed if placing a full order of these.The Szechaun has a sneaky type of heat that lingers in the back of your throat. It‚Äôs not overpowering but it‚Äôs there.The Chilled Sliced Pork with Garlic and Soya Sauce is somewhat underwhelming. I think that cold pork or meat of any type loses some of its flavor when served cold. The garlic is pronounced but well balanced with the soy sauce.The Pork Dumpling with Hot Chili Vinaigrette are nice big dumplings with a flavorful filling. The vinegar kind of overpowers the rest of the dish in my opinion.The Pan Fried Shanghai Pork Bun was somewhat of a surprise to me since I really had never had these before and was expecting more along the lines of a Char Sui type filling. The bun itself was very ‚Äúbready‚Äù and dense. The filling was somewhat sweet but as I was expecting a different taste this was not my favorite. The bread to meat ratio was also a big disappointment.I would definitely come back for the Xaio Long Bao as there were some interesting flavors. I actually prefer these to Din Tai Fung
4
Tasty food and has a huge variety of choices. Best known for their coloured flavours xiao long bao. They are also famous for their handmade noodles. Noodles is a must when you visit. However, recently realised that their portion of food is getting smaller?
5
Quality of food, ambiance and service is excellent here; so expect to pay a premium. This place serves one of the best xiao long bao you can find in Singapore. Highly recommended.
5
My husband researched this restaurant and wanted to go here for dim sum. Wow, we were not let down. Beautiful restaurant in the ION shopping center. Fantastic service and the food was to die for. We tried many different types of dim sum including a dessert. We were not disappointed. Highly recommende
5
We were a group of 6 dining on a Sunday. Definitely go for the famous dishes. We are from Hong Kong. So was slightly disappointed with Dining at Din Tai Fung as the portions seem to be smaller in Singapore. But we were pleasantly surprised here, we sampled Stir fried Marbled Beef, Kai Lan, The French Beans, Mixed Dumplings, Dan Dan Mian & Fried Rice with Shrimp. All was fabulous! I especially liked the Black Garlic Dumpling that I tasted. This was ample for 5 of us. Service was prompt, and the staff loved the fact that my western girls spoke Manderin with them. There is something to suit I think even the most fussiest of eaters at this wonderful Chinese Restaurant Haven
4
We came to sample the " Xiao Long Bao" Mixed dumpling dish which has a graduated 8 different dumplings with a range of fillings from light to heavier, the flavours are a mix of east and west. Oddly enough cheese seemed to work well as also Foie gras and truffle. We also had Sweet and Sour fish and Vegetable pork wonton soup. Even with service charge and GSt. The grand total added up to $47 singaporean- real value
4
Not that I'm saying Din Tai Fung is bad, we like going there. But, if we had a choice we'd choose Paradise Dynasty. The signature dish(es) is mian noodles, Sichuan noodles in a flavoursome spicy pork broth. We have the various Mian noodles every time we go. Yes there's lots more to choose from, some times we have the Xiao Long Bao, dumplings with soup inside, other dim sum and the usual Chinese fare. We've always enjoyed what we've chosen.The decor is faux traditional Chinese style and kind of belies the fact dishes are good value at less than S$20. Dinner can be less than S$50 for two of us.The only complaint is, like Din Tai Fung, there's no reservation system which can leave you waiting half an hour. A bit frustrating, particularly when you get inside and find 25% of tables unoccupied,Otherwise, we keep coming back for the spicy noodles
4
It is a great place to dine for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The choices of oriental cuisine is varied. Noteworthy is their famous "xiao long bao" - juicy steamed Chinese dumplings that come in eight different flavours. The stewed pork tastes great with plain rice. The ambience is nice and service is timely. It is certainly a choice place for a simple get-together or to bring foreign visitors for a treat
4
I was very hesitant when I went with office colleagues to Paradise Dynasty considering I am a vegetarian Indian - wasn't sure what I would get to eat. I was very pleasantly surprised to have a wide array of vegetarian options as well as great taste to go with it. I wish i could type and tell the dishes out (but my colleagues ordered it for me). Overall, great restaurant and it does get busy during lunch so an advance reservation of sorts would be good. We sat and had lunch for over 100 minutes and the service was a delight too. Much recommended

I often visit this place about once a month. They are famous for the 8 color dumpling. Personally, my fav flavour was the Ginseng flavour as it is very unique. As the ginseng taste is very strong. Other dishes I would recommend is the Dong Po meat, crab Meat with egg, ÂõõÂ≠£Ë±Ü. Expect to wait quite a while during peak hours. Their service is very good and attentive too.
4
I got the colorful Xiao Long Bao. They were mostly good. It was fun to taste them all. I think Din Tai Fung is a bit bland, these were tastier. I also got soup with dumplings. Its a very classy place, with old wealthy ladies dining with regular tourists like me
5
The rainbow Xiao Long Bao is tasty and a good novelty too! I personally like their XLB better than Din Tai Fung, and the value isn't too bad if you're from overseas.
Good to try out!

The Signature Dynasty Xiao Long Bao is awesome. Love the taste of it. Worth a try when visit this restaurant. The rest of the foods is quite normal comparing to some other restaurant in town. Service is good and the staffs is friendly.
4
I think this is a really well-run, relatively good service, good food, good environment Chinese restaurant. A little long wait during peak hours and weekends but I guess it is worth it when everything is rather good in this restaurant. Would definitely dine there again!
5
Great Ambient. Excellent presentation and taste in the various cuisine served here. Truffle dumpling is great while other flavor is good too. Beef Noodles is excellent; tender beef slices in spicy broth. Yummy.

Lovely restaurant in the mall ....Likes: decor, food, prices, and very popular with localsDislikes: nobody takes the time to explain how to order your food, which has to be ticked onto a card..... waited a long time for orders to be taken, only to realise that they were waiting for us to fill in our order form..... in a city full of tourists (and we were OBVIOUSLY tourists, it would be nice if one of the numerous staff were on hand to quickly explain the procedure). The food is good however

a friend bought lunch at paradise dynasty at level 4 ion orchard today on 29.9.2014. they do not take reservations so we arranged to go early at 11.45am to avoid traffic, carpark issues & avoid queue.we had 2 appetisers.crystal pork (ÈïáÊ±üÊ∑ÜËÇâ) was competent, nothing special.spicy dumplings (ÊäÑÊâã) was good, guess no better than crystal jade lamian xiaolongbao.the belly pork lamian was good! the soup was very tasty & smooth, the braised belly pork was excellent & the egg, noodles etc were all good. this was as good as a good japanese chashumen. we tried a poached sliced beef. it was pretty good, the usual tenderised beef. ambience was good & there was a good lunch crowd though not full & there was no queue when we left about 130pm.my friend ordered a pumpkin dessert. it was non-descript. i guess a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù dessert.there was a discount on some menu items under PGR (paradise gourmet rewards) + 30% rebates on non-discounted items. i think lunch came to about $50nett & there was a S$4.50 rebate. ok & doable lunch though nothing special. see my full reviews & photos at http://chefquak.com/2014/09/29/ok-lunch-paradise-dynasty-on-29sep2014

I went here purely to try their famous 8 flavours of xiao long bao and I was not disappointed! However I would recommend going with a group of 4+ and only ordering szechuan, garlic, black truffle, and foie gras (6 of each minimum). The other 4 flavours were no where near as awesome. Another one you must try is 4 pork dumplings in a delicious chilli soy sauce! The dumpling menu is surprisingly small and their tze cha menu was average, but the above mentioned dumplings make up for it
4
If you love waiting in line and you love dumplings, this is the place to go in Singapore!Make sure you order the assortment dish of coloured dumplings and eat it to your hearts content. I would order my own as you only get one dumpling for each flavour.Service was good very attentive and they limited the waiters/waitresses to a handful of tables so you know you get good treatment.Price is a little on the high side for Singapore but well worth the experience
5
Being packed on a weekday afternoon, we still managed to get a table without having to wait in queue. I swear by the La Mian and the xiaolongbao, both really delicious and well flavoured. Probably one of the best restaurants in town around the Orchard area. Good ambience and service
5
This place is not expensive and service is very good. I arrived and inform waitress that we are having a discussion and she arranged a corner table for us away from the crowd. The food is good and service is excellent. They are not intrusive but prompt in refilling our tea
4
There is always a queue at Paradise Dynasty. Usually, the wait is about 20 to 30 minutes. Service tends to be on the slow side in the restaurant as the waiting staff appears to be very busy.
4
Our group of four tried the Paradise Dynasty mainly because I wanted to try the 8 colour Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) which I read reviews about. I was not disappointed and could taste the difference in all but two - it was an enjoyable and unusual experience and the dumplings were fresh and full of liquid. The other dishes ordered were all rated good to very good and we thought the price was quite reasonable. The only quibble was the service which was quite poor. We were seated quickly and left with the menus, but left to figure out ourself that we had to order by marking our choices on a sheet which we then had to wave in front of a waitress to get her attention. Good location and easy to find on the 4th floor of the ION shopping mall
5
Generally more affordable then most of the other dim sum places around. Very good for an outing with friends or a date. Closes slightly later then most other restaurants in ION, which makes it good for last minute dinner decisions.The original and garlic xiao long bao are to die for, extremely delicious!The noodle dishes and fried rice are also very affordable and tasty. Also, don't miss the fried red bean pancake
2
Dinner for six on a Wed evening was a big disappointment. We had chosen the place for a birthday dinner after an enjoyable first visit over Lunar New Year this year, but this second visit had us vowing not to return. We had ordered dim sum, meat and veg dishes and fried rice. Dimsum of xiaolongbao was tasty though not exceptional, but this was followed by a long break of more than half an hour. After reminders, we were served a dish of prawns which looked rather anaemic and tasted mediocre. This dish got cold before we were served a second dish of beef, which was tastier. Another long break, some more reminders, then came mapo tofu. It was spicy, and we asked again could we please have the fried rice and other dishes. Were told that the rice was being cooked by a different person so we would have to wait! Rice and remaining veg dish arrived at last, very mediocre, but by then the earlier dishes were all cold. We quickly ordered mango pudding for dessert and it arrived soon after we finished our meal, was tastier than main meal. Overall, the long waiting time between dishes and the indifferent service made the mediocre food less than palatable, so we won't be returning
3
Finally had a personal encounter with the much raved about and popular Xiao LongBao. Had 8 pieces of sampling basket. Enticing colors of various flavors. Though attractive, the dumplings did not leave much impression. La Mien was said to be of long-hours-cooked-broth. However, still found theflavor to be bland. Lack of a strong robust broth taste. Fried rice with shrimp was nicely done up. Which I would love to have a goagain. Desserts were acceptable. Overall, a good and presentable place for business entertainment. Would personally prefer Taste Paradise. Both for the decorative ambiance andchoices of food
4
The xiao long bao and the noodles are very good. The Sichuan beef stomach and the Sichuan organs are also yummy, if you're into that kind of stuff. What's unique is most of the dishes here come with an unusual twist. As it's good value, the place is always full
3
8 flavor Xiaolongbao was the reason I visited this place but I ended up liking other dishes more, such as noodles and soups. The Xiaolongbao was interesting but after I finished them all I felt it was a bit too much to me, although it was worth trying. Tantan noodle and Wantop soup we tried were very simple and good. In the hall it felt kind of crowded because there wasn't enough space among tables, but the interior was pretty good. Overall it was an ok experience, and I might visit one of their branches again in the future
3
Our visit in January was my third visit, I think it's because I want it to be a better version of Din Tai Fung! It's not bad and I've tried most of the varieties but couldn't bring myself to try the cheese variety. Service is great and the concept is good. If you want a bit of variety in your Xiao Long Bao, give it a try. The queues are always long so if you want to stop for lunch while shopping, try to get there early
5
The best xiao long bao in the country! Steaming hot juicy and a little bit sweet xiao long bao that explodes in your mouth!The la mian is to die for too! The pork broth is so tasty and the noodle is al dente!The fried rice aren't too salty and cooked to perfection.We simply love it
4
Always come here when I have a la mian craving. Love the texture of their noodles at the kitchen's efficiency in dishing out the food once orders are placed. Not a big fan of the colourful xlbs though. Think they shld stick to the original ones and perhaps think of other forms of using foie gras etc in chinese food
3
Really liked the fois gras xiao long bao - tasty. The others were fine or ok, but didn't knock me over. Beef noodle soup was good too.
5
Due to popularity, this restaurant does not take bookings!
We took a ticket and waited 30 mins for a table
Well worth it the food was sensational, every dish outstanding.
5
Pork bone soup la mian is delicious! Mix it with a generous serving of original flavor xiaolongbao and you are set for a good meal to share.
The radish pastry is fantastic as a close to a meal.
4
Amazing place, nice ambiance, quick service and good food. However, food menu seems to be running out of options for vegetarian food.
5
After a long day of walking around the city, we were treated to the best assorted xiao long bao we've ever tasted! While that may be the resto's main attraction, its fish fillet swimming in a bowl-full of chili soup was likewise to blast! Add to that their version of the wrapped minced pork, plus, even their yangchow fried rice was just too good! Bottomline, I'd probably go back to that resto every time I visit Singapore
4
we had gone for dinner -- reco by our son for a gourmet Chinese mealwe were highly satisfied -- i strongly recommend this restaurant for a special occasion meal excellent taste , superb display , very good service ,decent portions Obviously , it is high priced -- but on special occasion one should not look at the right side of the menu card !!!!In our next trip we shall certainly visit once more -
5
This place is best for its xiao long baos (dumplings). From the texture to its meat fillings, its just high culinary skills are high quality ingredients. If you are the first time here, try the multi coloured all flavours one to get a feel of whats nicer for you
5
My family & I (4 of us) will always order 4 baskets of the colourful dumplings because they are very fragrant, delicious especially the truffle dumpling & the dumplings' skins are not thick & so easy to chew.We also like their noodles. Their noodles' tectures are not thick & also very easy to chew.Worth your $$$ & worth your calories!!
1
Went there last evening for dinner with a friend. We ordered 1 fried rice, 1 fried noodles and 1 vegetable dish. The lady at the entrance showed us in and ask if we want any drink. We said no but would be nice if you have warm water and she said yes and ok. We waited... it didn't come and I ask another waitress for the water and she said wait awhile. Fine, we waited. After more than 15 mins of waiting for just 2 cups of water which still has yet to arrive...I again ask for the water and still it did not come. Finally after a long wait while eating our food where all mood and appetite is gone... I asked another lady which I believed is the captain and feedback to her our long awaiting PLAIN WATER. Finally... all it took was for her to tell her staff and our water finally came.I was still not happy after dinner. Upon payment, I asked the cashier who was the duty manager in charge and he answered me what was it about and refuse to give me a name!! I just cant believe that we paid for a dinner that was cold, tasteless and service was bad. Will never return again.:
4
If you want to come here go for rainbow dumplings!8 different types in 8 different colors (traditional, garlic, truffle, foie gras, crab, Sichuan chili..... And I don't remember) to be tasted in the right order!Ideal for a lunch break during shopping in Ion Orchar
5
I normally don't give points for atmosphere/ambiance but Paradise dynasty has a very quiet and calming feel to it even though you are seated very close to the main kitchen. Food is brilliant, of course. Shanghai dumplings are a must-try.
2
This is place serves below average shanghainese food such as la mian (noodle) and xiaolongbao (dumplings). Serves 2-3 soup and some shanghainese (dimsum) snacks.
5
At the top of Ion there is a special place that has great food, busy atmosphere and great service. The food is always delicious and we love coming here with friends or as a family. Even at busy times, they try to seat you quickly but we have never waited more than 10mins.The food - the 8 flavour Xiao Long Bao is nice but the pork dumplings and prawns with the green beans are favourites. We keep going back and highly recommend it
3
We went here just to order Xiao Long Bao for take out. The service was fast, since it wasn't their peak hours.We ordered the 8 flavor Xiao Long Bao, and it was really unique to my taste buds. When you bite into the dimsum, there is a burst of flavorful liquid. A must try when going to Singapore
3
We had a lunch on sunday, without reservation. We got seated very quickly, although the restaurant was a bit crowded. We liked the food and the atmosphere but it took a very long time to get our dishes and we had the feeling they forgot us for a while
3
This is a popular eatery that commands long queue during dinner. According to their website and signboard at the entrance, it opens at 10 am on Sunday, and no reservation is accepted. So we arrived at 9.55am and was told by an arrogant staff that it will only open at 10.30 and she made us feel like a nuisance (Isn't it time to change your communication materials?). The dinning area is big but the lighting seems to suffer technical problem and blinked irregularly that irritates the eyes. Their menu is similar to Din Tai Fung (another popular dumpling store here). Signature dish is Rainbow Colour Xiao Long Bao, great novelty value and a feast for the eyes - white for original, green for ginseng, peach for foie gras, black for truffle, yellow for cheese, orange for carb roe, lilac for garlic and fuchsia for spicy, 8 mini-dumplings for S$14.80++ The taste differentials between them are mild, it seems that the only differences are the colourings and the soup, the fillings are the same. The Shanghai Pork Buns, freshly made La Mian (noodle) and desserts are all finely made, cook to perfection and served at the right temperature. Our breakfast bill was S$$23.50 per head. Great food overall, no wonder they are so popular, but I preferred Din Tai Fung's Xiao Long Bao
4
We stopped here for lunch over the weekend. We waited about 5mins to be seated but once we were seated the service was fine. My friend has been there a few times before so he took control of the ordering. It's very simple, you look at the menu, which is full of pictures (I love picture menus!), choose which dishes you would like & fill out the order card. A waitress then confirms with you your order & it goes from there. We ordered a selection of dishes & they were all good. We had a spicy tofu & beef mince dish - delicious, the tofu was so silken it was amazing! The spice was just right & it came out piping hot. We also ordered some Shanghai rice - standard fried rice really but very nice. Then we had the 'drunken chicken', this is one of the chef's recommendations but we didn't enjoy it. The chicken was cold, like refrigerator cold so clearly it was meant to be this way; the alcohol that it had been marinated in, was to my taste too strong. We weren't really sure what to expect with this dish however if we had have known it was served cold we probably would have chosen something else. We also ordered a side of garlic spinach - don't order this if you're on a date it was well garlicky but that's exactly how I like it!For the two of us lunch was only 50SGD which I felt was more than acceptable considering some of the meal prices here. If you're looking for good quality food at reasonable prices in a shopping centre this place is definitely worth a try. We will definitely be back again
4
The colorful xiao long paos were what drew me to this lavishly-decorated restaurant to begin with, and I must say that I was not disappointed at all.Paradise Dynasty has a lovely ambience complete with an upper-class authentic Chinese feel - ornate carvings and crystal lamps forming part of the the decor.The colorful xiao long paos were delicious as well - especially the ginseng chicken ones and the crab roe ones.

We had a splendid lunch at this restaurant. The flavours were clear and distinctive. I was served the best dumplings that I have ever had. The service was exceptionally good and the waitress was attentive and very friendly. She made the meal a pleasure by frequently amusing the very young children who dined with us. Certainly a very good place for families. One aspect that could be improved is the quality of the tea which accompanied the meal. No complaints though on how well we were served the tea as our cups were constantly topped up. A very good feature of this restaurant was that one could see the chefs making the food in the steamy kitchen. We were all fascinated by the expertise of one of the chefs who was making noodles by hand. Overall a first class venue for a family lunch.
5
Probably one of the best restaurants I have ever been for the Xiao Long Bao (Shanghai dumplings), together with the Ding Tai Fung, which is also another famous restaurant. You can choose from a range of different colorful Xiao Long Bao, all of them represent a different taste (black truffle, ginger, sichuan, original flavor, etc...). You can either take one set of just one type, or a mix of every type! Of course, that's the specialty there but they have so many other dishes ! The interior of the restaurant is just amazing, decoration is really something to underline and the waiters are also nicely dressed, it suits perfectly. The service was very good, smiling and efficient!I highly recommend this place. Either book in advance or you can pick up a ticket there and might have to wait for your number (approx 20-30 min on average I would say
4
Always good value, dishes fresh and tasty, I have been here several times and have always been happy with meal serves and friendly service.
5
This is my favourite restaurant for xiao long bao, always so tasty! I come back every time I'm in Singapore. The wait is worth it. Staff are attentive and the restaurant has a very nice ambience.
5
If you are looking for quality shanghainese food. This is the place to go. They have 8 different flavoured dumplings. However we opt for the original ones. We also ordered chicken double boiled soup. Yummy! And basic dried pull noodle. I think the best one is the simplest one. Spring rolls are very good too. We enjoyed our lunch there. Simon Pugh, Darwin
4
Dine here last night and ordered as usual the xiao long baos. I think the skin of the xiao long bao is a tad too thick but the soup and meat inside them are still as tasty.The seafood la mien is good, excellent soup base. The minced meat dry noodles, zha Jiang mien is tasty as well.Good value for money joint but needs to wait for a long time to get a table
5
The restaurant is at ION shopping mall. I guarantee that xiao long bao at paradise dynaste is the best I've ever had. I have eaten at other restaurant which has been claimed the best xiao long bao. But I have to say that paradise dynasty is the best for xiao long bao. You must try. Another dish is dumpling in chili sauce. I still think of eating it. I recommend this restaurant for xiao long bao
3
Ordered the different flavours xiao long bao and a wine dessert to go with it. The xiao long bao so so, don't find thedifferent flavours distinctive and fantastic. Wine dessert quite weired. The dining environment is certainly worth the trying but taste of food quite blend. I think amongthe paradise group, i only desire the pork bun at paradise inn. It's quite unreplaceable. I will try dynasty again for the ambience and la mian
5
Was taken here by a friend who recommended it and was not disappointed. The restaurant was packed and the open kitchen is a nice idea so you can see the chefs preparing the dim sum. We had the xiao long bao(which is why many people visit) and they were very good! We had a wide selection of food and it was all brought to our table promptly and was tasty. The price for 3 people was very reasonable, much better than what you pay in London for a similar standard of food
2
It was peak hour on a weekday during dinner time. The waitress at the counter informed us that the queue would take 30 minutes. That's fine. We waited for 30 minutes and were ushered inside. We ordered a cold dish, noodles with gravy and xibs. First of all when we attempted to order noodles, the waitress told us that the noodles will take another 30 minutes to prepare. What? That's almost an hour since we first started to wait! Fine, we ordered noodles anyway since we had starters and some dimsum. The xlbs arrives and they were made so poorly that they were stuck to the bottom of the bamboo basket and most of them broke when we attempted to lift them (mind you we are locals and have been eating them for a long time). Next came the noodles. They were clumped together! What in the world? When we told the waitress she just stared at the noodles and brought it away. She returned 5 min later with the same bowl of noodles but it looked like it had been stirred. Taste and presentation-wise the noodles were very unappetizing. The whole experience wasn't helped by the two ladies sitting next to us, who looked like they were equally angry at the waiting time and food quality. I expected better because I have been to the restaurant a couple of times and have always loved it previously. Your kitchen obviously cannot handle the load of customers during dinner time! Step up your game
5
Went here for lunch with two friends after being highly recommended. What a surprise and revelation. The xiao long bao was amongst the very best I have had. The selection of food is amazing. Service is a bit abrupt and rushed but efficient. Cannot recommend this restaurant too hightly. If you love dim sum then this is the place to go. By the Way The Paradise Group has over 50 restaurants throughout Singapore and this one was obviously just one of them. You cannot reserve a table so simply go and join the queue. We waited about 15 minutes. If you are a dim sum fan please give it a try
4
Visited Paradise Dynasty after a few months (sorry, had been checking the thousand new Din Tai Fungs that have been propping up). Happy to note that neither the food nor the service standards have fallen. The xiao long bao is still among the best you can have been in Singapore, and the noodles with dan-dan sauce probably the best. Unlike the Din Tai Fungs, the choices are more limited (though that is probably because there are so many Din Tai Fungs and only one Paradise Dynasty)
4
I ate their on my own, loved the tasting of 8 dumplings, the staff advised well and will go back again
2
The service at this restaurant makes you feel like you're eating at a food-court. Staff are grumpy and clumsy. The food would have tasted better if its not served so cold. Even hot tea can't be counted on. Go factor: NO
5
Had a great meal here. Similar to Din Tai Fung - not quite as good but certainly close! The service was excellent and we certainly enjoyed a very extenstive menu.
4
Now we know why we waited for 40 mins... Food was so food, enjoyed every single bit of it. Good variety of dishes.. Definitely worth the wait and the money we paid.
3
A lot of empty space, but don't open to customs, as they want to keep a queue outside to show that they are very popular. Heard the conversation between the reception and the insider waitress.
5
After traveling all the way from the Untied States, we were taken that afternoon to this restaurant to experience our first taste of Singapore dinner food. Great food especially the chicken rice dish which we all enjoyed. Food Safety and cleanliness were apparent as they have an exhibition kitchen where all the cooks are wearing chef hats and face masks
4
Went for a semi-formal dinner at Paradise Dynasty with a friend. The place was reasonably crowded. The ushering staff made a mess of seating us and at the end, my friend just walked in and sat at a table - well, thats the way it worked. I would have been left standing if I would have depended on the ushering staff!!!The food was good. Again, had to remind the waiting staff about our order before it was served! Ambiance - 6/10Location - 9/10food quality - 8/10Presentation - 6/10Service - 3/10btw, each of the staff have their iPad which is used to collect feedback! Return for diner N
4
On a Friday night, our group of 3 managed to get a table as soon as walked up to the front counter. This is in spite of the short queue outside the restaurant. It seems priority is given if all diners for a table are present.Food taste just right, not too salty or greasy, as typical of most dim sum place.Service is good. Customers are greeted when entering and leaving the restaurant.Tea is charged at $1.20 per person and waitresses would frequently come round to ask if you need a refill.The 8 pcs of mixed dumpling is of different flavours/color; with a note to suggest the order you should start/end tasting the different flavours.The fried rice is fluffy and not too salty. Another favorite is the La mien with stewed beef
3
Food was decentThe pictures you see is xiao long bao. But I gotta say it didn't do it for me. The fancy flavors some just didnt taste right. Din tai fung better in my opinionThat being said the short rib, veggies dessert was all pretty good.fried rice - eh. service - awesome that they had people with disabilities servicing - however the people that were designated as the waiters were kinda hard to get a hold off
3
They offer plenty flavor s of xiaolong bao. They have truffle, crab roe, ginseng, foie gras, Szechuan. It's for the adventurous foodie. Taste good though but the skin of xiaolong bao is not so thin. They have variety of dishes. My dad enjoyed the pork cubes. The queue is long on a Sunday, so its better to go early
3
We've visited quite a few times and I felt that their food is not that special for the price that we have paid. The atmosphere is too dark also.
5
Loved the Xiao long Bao (dumplings) that are served there. Though the different varieties of xiao long Bao ranging from original, garlic, truffle, ginseng, È∫ªËæ£ and so one are the highlights but my friends and I still enjoy the original flavor Xiao Long Bao, simply because we loved the original taste. I personally enjoyed the ÂÜ∑Ëèú. Found them to be refreshing and tasty. There's one time when we ordered fried minced pork that can be wrapped in crepe. Very tasty but found the portion to be more suitable for 3 to 4 pax instead of sharing between 2 pax. Enjoyed the ramen as well. It is bouncy and fine. The type that I will enjoy. Desserts are good too. Service and ambience is good. I enjoyed the Pu er tea the restaurant served. Price is reasonable for the food quality, service an ambience. Only thing is the restaurant do not accept reservation. But overall experience is still good!
4
We ordered Xiao Long Bao, Sheng Jian Bao, Shanghai Fried Rice, Pork Belly e.t.cXiao Long Bao was Excellent!, definitely going back for more!! The way the pork belly's fats melt in your mouth is heavenly and the flesh is soooooo tender!! I already know what to order the next time I have time to queue there
4
On level 4 of Ion Orchard, this restaurant always has a long line waiting to get in, both at lunch and dinner time.They serve Chinese tea from a teapot with a long spout, probably a couple of feet long.My favorite dish here is the fish cooked in Chinese Wine
5
My family and I spend a fair bit of time in Singapore. Spending time in Singapore means that you'll spend some quotient of time shopping. If your shopping takes you to ION on Orchard and you get hungry - go to Paradise Dynasty on the 4th floor.Let's get the small stuff out of the way first: the decor is 'nice' - it works well for a Chinese food style restaurant - I wouldn't want to live there - but it's a nice decor to enjoy a meal.It's clean from top to bottom. But that's not saying too much as it's Singapore. If it were NOT clean the manager/manageress of the restaurant would probably be jailed for life or executed ... or worse! So I wouldn't worry about the condition of the cups, plates, utensils - in the number of times I've been we've never had a single concern! The menu is simple to navigate. Everything is in mandarin and english. When they present you the menu they present you with a 'score card' to fill in. It is NOT the most elegant way of doing things - but it is pretty fast and efficient."The proof of the pudding is in the eating" Ignore the decor. Ignore the fact that you take a medium/long multiple-choice test (NO.2 pencil provided) to order your food. Ignore that when they bring the food (quickly) the server will cross it off your list of items. Ignore that everything is served family style - so you have to serve yourself once the food is brought to the table... because what they bring to the table is tasty!!!I don't know how - but everything they cook, be it steamed or blanched or fried is incredibly LIGHT. Some of my favorites are the scallion cakes (not to be confused with American/Chinese style Scallion Pancakes!) are fresh scallions, diced and packed in some type of flakey pastry ... they are fried - but they don't come out greasy or unctuous - they are airy and flavorful. Same goes for the xiao long bao! Excellent! Not too much ginger - not too much garlic! Not too much soup - not too much dough! They are just right!And that's how everything comes out - flavorful and light! You don't feel as though you've been punched in the stomach after you've eaten and you never get the impression that everything has been salted beyond recognition! It is genuinely good to eat.Then you get up and feel perfectly capable of logging in a few more rounds of shopping!So - if you are in ION and your stomach starts to rumble - take the escalator to the 4th floor and amble into Paradise Dynasty
4
I decided to have dinner at Paradise Dynasty as I was craving for some Xiao Long Pau and La Mian. Went there yesterday with my boyfriend. This was the first time for him to have La Mian and Xiao Long Pau. As usual, the food was fantastic. The quality of the food was never a disappointment. I had the hot and sour La Mian which has always been a "favourite" of mine and my companion had Mince Beef La Mian. We also decided to have the 8 pieces Xiao Long Pau sample. What I wanted to point out in this review was our server, who was really awesome. Her name is Mandy Ong. I have eaten here more than 10 times but it was only yesterday that a server from this restaurant left a good impression. She was really attentive, friendly and always had a smile on her face. We were seated outside and she single-handedly took care of 6 tables. I had an enjoyable evening yesterday because of Mandy and the good food from Paradise Dynasty
4
Their signature dim sums are good and they offer them also as a mix set of 8 different flavours which is is a nice way to test what you like. Nuddles are tasty but the rest (main dishes) are not that special. Value is ok with around 100SGD for lunch for 4 (2 kids). Be prepared to wait a bit for a table.There are better places for Chinese food in Singapore like Din Tai Fung or Cherry Garden. Check my other reviews of Singapore restaurants..
4
I wanted to try its signature "Siu Long Biao" with 8 different colors and tastes... We had been queuing for nearly an hour! Finally got our seats when we almost wanted to leave...The speed of delivering food is quite efficient. We ordered different kinds of dumplings, and of cuz, the signature Siu Long Biao in 8 different tastes (SGD 14.8)!The Siu Long Biao here is very juicy, fresh and tasty. I would love to come again but the queue is just too long..
4
I had a great time trying each of the 8 different flavors of Shanghai dumplings: ginseng, cheese, foie gras, szechuan pepper, truffle, classic, garlicAlso had the chicken la mian; it was a little bland (I was sharing with a friend who didn't like spicy food; sigh) but good quality. Would definitely recommend for a nice meal in Orchard, esp the shanghai dumplings tastin

Tucked away behind a narrow entrance, is the very expansive Paradise Dynasty. Signature dish is the multicoloured xiao long bao. A range of 8 different fillings really well presented - it certainly doesn't disappoint and is so good, you need to order two serves!Service is OK - fast and efficient. Seems a bit odd in a restaurant that has an upmarket appearance that you need to write down what you want to eat and then have the waiter recite the order back to you. Not sure why they don't just take down the order?Internal layout is great. Large open kitchen so you can see everything being made if you're interested! Good atmosphere and you can go back to more shopping after you've recharged your stomach!Will be back

try the 8 coloured xlb .. great service and decor
A very good alternative to Ding tai fung in singapore

Been to the newly opened outlet at Lot One
Service was great, staff were helpful too
The XiaoLong Bao is much better than at DingTaiFeng

Had my favorite dumpling , long bean, cold tofu , cumcber salad and finished it off with ginger dumpling desert . Yummylicious .......and all for less than ¬£30.00 for 2 pax .

Went here for a family diner. The place looks really nice and stylish (airco a bit too cold) and the dumplings are to die for. Din tai fung used to be my favorite for dumplings but this is my new favorite! Try the basket with the different colors and after that order some more of your favorite color! The pigskin/fat was also really nice. Liked the spicy soup less but maybe cause i was already full by the dumplings ;) will come again for sure

I ate the pig bone soup la mian, it was delicious and authentic , the suan la la mian was also good which my friend ordered, good for those who like sour food. We ordered the orange colored xiao long bao, I don't really like it as I could smell the fishy smell but the original xiao long bao is good and delicious. Ate 3 out of 6 xiao long bao.The sweet and sour pork not so nice, don't bother to order as u can eat better ones outside. The fried bao was delicious but I can't remember the name of it, it taste like a big xiao long bao coz the soup(or sauce) was still trapped in the bun(amazingly). As we started to eat then the sauce starts to drip.If u are not a chilli fan , don't eat the Sze chuan beef slices la mian. It's so spicy, it jus kills ur taste bud. I love to eat lotsa chilli but it was too hot for me, my friend gave up eating. The stewed beef la mian was good too. The beef was very tender.There is this radish puff that was delicious too, it's a must try if u like pastry.Worth the try but you have to wait for a long time ( as long as 1 hour for us of 4 pax) in order to eat

Located at ION, this restaurant prides itself on creative dumplings and always has a big crowd waiting to go in however there are many better restaurants if you are looking for a delicious lunch. The food was OK but if you want yummy steamed dumplings I would definitely go to Din Tai Fung (located at Paragon and scattered around Singapore) or Imperial Treasure which is also at ION. After frequenting these other two, my children were also disappointed with Paradise Dynsasty

I eat at Paradise Dynasty at least once a month with friends. The restaurant interiors are great and the service professional. The kitchen is like a mini lab with chefs making hand made dumplings and other great dishes behind glass viewing windows that span the entrance walkway. Their flavoured Xiao Long Bao (steamed dumpling pouches that also contain a little soup) that includes foie gras, black truffle and crab roe. You can order a mix or all the same flavours.On the menu is a wide range of Chinese dishes - some cater for the local palet but the less adventurous diners have plenty of choice. The braised pork belly is sinfully good. The La Mian noodles with poached marbled beef in Szechuan style is super hot so order only if you love chili and spicy dishes. Food wise depending on what you order you can expect to pay $25-$30 a head which for the quality of the food served at Paradise Dynasty and it's location is pretty decent.Paradise Dynasty don't take bookings so expect to take a number and wait on busy days if you want to sit inside. They do have outdoor seating but unless it's the evening, sitting outside in Singapore is a sweaty option...Paradise have a lot of different concept outlets in Singapore - don't expect the same food at each restaurant nor the same service quality but generally, the food is always good

Along with some of the Din Tai Fung branches, this remains my favorite dim sum place in Singapore. The food is truly amazing. Most of their dishes are consistently good and the service is also great. Try their signature 8-flavored dim-sum basket. The hand-made ramen noodles are also done very well. The only quib I have is the long waiting periods, which could be better organized if they gave paging devices to patrons who could then walk around the mall

There were three of us for mid-week lunch and you can't book a table so we had to wait until our number was called. The wait wasn't long. Inside the restaurant is vast and we were served very efficiently which was great as two of us had massive hangovers (the tea was free-flowing to keep us hydrated). The food was all outstanding from the cucumber and garlic salad that looked very uninspiring but tasted wonderful to the foie gras dumplings, beef that melted in your mouth, crunchy spring rolls, fried rice, pork buns, prawns in chilli sauce - it was all fantastic. I can't comment on the price as I didn't pay but believe it to be affordable. We over-ordered and so I got a doggy bag to take home. Such value for money I forgot we were in the middle of a shopping centre

This is a fast pace chain restaurant that offers the best dim sum I have ever eaten. This is their specialty; when you enter the restaurant, you will see a dozen or so sous chefs doing all different kinds of dim sums...and I recommend you take the set with all flavors and colors. It is simple, but fabulous. The other dishes we had are also very good

The xiao long boa was the best. Disliked the shanghai fried rice too oily.

Great food and the coloured dumplings are fabulous, a definite must try!

Visited Paradise Dynasty on a Saturday at 1pm, had to wait about 20 minutes for a table for 2. Overall I found Paradise Dynasty to be a nice restaurant with good food at a reasonable price.We ordered the Pork Dumplings w/ Chili, Multi-Colored XLB, and La Mian w/ Braised Pork. I found the XLB to be excellent and on par with other good XLB in Singapore. I did not like all of the flavors but it is worth trying them all once to see which you prefer. The La Mian was excellent. The Pork Dumplings w/ Chili I would not order again. I could see some people liking it but we found this dish to be a complete dud
5
Some might say it's wrong to have xiao long bao multi coloured, but they are extremely delicious. And so are the other items they serve! In my opinion, clearly the best place to go for dumplings in Singapore.Especially in the evening you have to expect to wait for quite a while. Make sure you go grab your ticket as soon as you arrive
5
A very good place to have lunch and dinner. They have 8 flavor xiao long pau. Something that you can hardly get other places. Their lai mian very good too, soup or stir-fry is both good. Prices were very decent, didn't realize good price at such a high class place. Good place to go and recommend, will difinitely come back for it

I had just realised that its been a year since I last visited this restaurant.As usual, have to grab a Q number which took me 15 minutes to sit down in the restaurant. It's still as crowded as usual and in view of the crowd, was there during the weekend, the Q management system of the restaurant is pretty efficient as i waited only 15 minutes.The siao long baos are still as good as the first day. I had something different yesterday as instead of the la mian, I chose the yang Zhou fried rice which is pretty good. I have realised that the chefs are the ones serving the piping hot dishes in this restaurant. The other servers also ensured that our Chinese tea are always top-up. The restaurant does have an outside sitting area. Great location in the central of the famous orchard road easily assessible by public transport.

The ION Orchard location was mobbed last night, about a 30 minute wait for a table for two. Adjacent restaurants weren't crowded; this place has a buzz.That said, it was just a tad disappointing. We had eaten at the Jakarta location of Paradise Dynasty just a few nights ago and thought it was sensational. The soup dumplings are wonderful; the various pork and chicken dishes well spiced and tender.The Singapore outpost may be a bit overwhelmed by its success .. because the service, while earnest, was average ... and the food just didn't have the pizazz that we'd experienced in the Jakarta restaurant. All in all, as Chinese restaurants go, Paradise Dynasty is well worth the money. But if you have a chance to go to the Senayan location in Jakarta ... do that

What has become our Sunday usual brunch‚Ä¶.yup- Dim Sum:). Last time we were in Singapore we went to Yum Cha in Chinatown, which was a very traditional style of dining on dim sum. This time we chose Paradise Dynasty in the Ion Orchard shopping center, a quick walk from our hotel. It received high marks on TripAdvisor so how could we go wrong? Wow, it did not disappoint. From the outside, it‚Äôs very unassuming as well but once you walk in, you are transported with their traditionally decorated Chinese rooms. Paradise Dynasty is known for its Xiao Long Bao which we just love so we ordered up their garlic style ones. Holy heavenly‚Ä¶..we then continue on with the Shanghai pan-fried pork buns, the pork dumplings with chili sauce, and the La Mian noodles with poached marbled beef, Szechuan style. What a phenomenal meal‚Ä¶easily top 3 Dim Sum meals that I have ever had. http://www.internationalnabers.com/2012/05/25/great-beers-found-in-singapore

I love the dry noodles with lots and lots of fried onions/shallots. They were absolutely delicious. The Paradise Group hasn't failed to impress me at all and i have been to almost all of the restaurants. Value for money and yummy! Service is not bad given a busy afternoon. The Xiao Long Bao (Dumplings) were averagely ok though, nothing to shout about but no complains from me. If you are coming to this tiny island for a holiday/business trip and are staying around the area and am feeling mind-boggled about the sheer number of varieties this tiny country have; then perhaps consider dropping by here? :

Will definitely try this place again. Cheaper than its neighbouring store Dynasty by the same group, on the same floor, (the dim sum is great at the other store by the way. Pricey by good) the dishes are interesting, full of flavour! Different from some of the other Chinese restaurants we have here in Singapore.Reasonably priced for the qualityof food and location of outlet
5
Food is delicious. Try their bamboo shoots. They have the eight flavored xiao long Bao though I'm not a big fan of them. Their rice cake in chicken broth with preserved vegetables is a delightful dish that distinguishes itself from the rest of these eateries
5
Amazing Xiao Long Bao - the 8 flavours are a must!!
5
Fantastic dim sum and brilliant noodles. If the large queue out the front isn't a good enough hint of the delights inside, then I dont know what to say. The xiao lung pao are delicious, and the variety of flavours is pretty interesting, (alarmingly so) as they all seem to work quite well. Foie gras? Your kidding right? No, it works really well, as do the cheesey and the garlic! The noodles are also brilliant, with great sauces and soups. Get in early
4
When you have to take a number and wait for just over 30 minutes, it's a sure indication that you might be in for something good. The only comparison I have for this type of Chinese cuisine is with the Crystal Jade Xiao Long Bao chain. Well, this place got it beat. The food is innovative and the service was fast and good. Highly recommended if you yen for Chinese cuisine that's a little out of the ordinary, for eg. Foie gras Xiao Long Bao. How's that for the exotic. Only reason I didn't rate this with 5 stars is my own personal preference for Cantonese cuisine. This place offers anything but. Though not to my taste buds, the food was good
4
So far, this is the best xiao lung pao ever, they have many flavours, I recommend garlic and se zhuan. Every lunch time and weekend, we have to wait to be seated, and maybe because its always crowded, the table very dirty, wet and smells so bad.
5
This is the best chinese restaurant in Singapore! Since my husband and I discovered this restaurant we go at least once a week!Lovely decor, great food and great service! The food comes very fast and hot!Dishes I recommend: All the dumplings are delicious but specially the colored ones "Xiao Long Bao", the fried rice, the shredded pork, crispy sweet and sour pork, spicy cashew chicken...But again, whatever you order it's going to taste fantastic!HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!! IT'S A MUST IF YOU COME TO SINGAPORE

Loved the xiao long bao... very fresh and flavorful. You could see them rolling the dough and filling the dumplings as you walked in. They have a set of 8 "flavored" xiao long bao (truffle, crab roe, ginseng, foie gras, cheese, garlic, szechuan and original), and while they were colorful and very good, the different flavors were subtle and did not stand out. I'd say you can order the colorful set, or the original and you would be very happy either way. We also had the La Mian noodles, which were very good, and two other dim sum plates along with a single order of the colorful xiao long bao, which was plenty for 2 people and along with some tea came to 40SD. We tried this place based on a recommendation of a local food blogger who said that it was the best xiao long bao in Singapore, and though we didn't try them at any other place, I am sure the blogger is right! Paradise Dynasty is in the Ion Shopping Center on Orchard Blvd. I highly recommend it

Could not resist the multi colored and flavored XLB. My two personal favs are Black Truffle and Foie Gras. Dim sum is good too, come weekday afternoon when it's less crowded as they do not take reservations. Avoid weekend dinners as you spend previous time queuing outside waiting for your number. Quality ambience with a nice Orchard view if you sit by window (and if I remember correctly, there is outdoor seatin

I love xiao long baos so i was pretty excited to dine at paradise dynasty as i've heard a lot about the colourful XLBs with 8 different flavours. Sadly, i think these novel XLBs are too hyped up and I very much prefer the original ones. It is worth a try but it is not a must-eat for me. For other food items, I think their snacks are all pretty well done. We ordered a soup dumpling dish in ma la sauce (can't really remember the exact name) which was so good! The oozing soup, juicy meat and just a tinge of spiciness from the sauce blended together really well. The red bean pancake was also nicely done. It wasn't too sweet and the crust was crispy and just right. It is also quite thin so you don't feel sick of eating it. I ate the zha jiang mian which was alright, nothing to rave of. But the portion is really big! The service was also good. Our tea was constantly replenished and they even have some fancy tea-pouring skills which was quite interesting to watch. Although we took quite long to decide on our orders, the staff did not pester us to make our orders as in other chinese restaurants. We went early at around 6.30pm on a weekday so there wasn't a queue yet. But when we left the restaurant, there was a long queue outside. The restaurant operates on a queue number system like din tai fung, in which you take a number and wait for your number to be flashed. They require everybody to arrive before you can enter though. Overall, i think the food is not bad and the prices are affordable. We spent around $135 after taxes for a group of 7. I think Paradise Dynasty is one of the cheaper restaurants under the paradise group. Another good point is that they do not provide peanuts or whatever Â∞èËèú like usual chinese restaurants. They also do not provide wet tissues so you won't have to pay an unnecessary fee for the snack and wet tissues. The ambience and service are also good. I will visit the restaurant again but it is probably not advisable to go during peak dinner times

If you love xiao long bao, you have to try the array of novel xiao long baos on offer at Paradise Dynasty.With flavors like foie gras, black truffle, garlic, ginseng, sichuan and cheese xiao long bao on offer, and with their flavors all extremely well balanced with the original xiao long bao succulent meat and sweet, tasty soup going for less than $15 per sampler basket of 8 different flavors of xiao long bao, this place offers fun, novel, affordable and delish XLBs for all XLB fans.The other dishes are not bad but the true star here is definitely the xiao long baos. Would recommend this place to anyone who can eat pork (they use pork for the XLBs)
