Name caught my eye and curiosity, so we went inside. If you like pancakes and the like, this is heaven!

I have been staying near this restaurant for 3 years and did not try until now as I was not attracted to the food they are selling.
After trying, I will come back again.

Lets just say we went there twice during our 4 day stay in Singapore. Highly recommended. Nothing but quality there.

The steak is good but alittle overly done. House Wine is good too. Australia cab sav! Really adorable place lol

The waffles we had were really good! Pricey, but you payfor the quality (13 sgd one portion). Coffee was ok. Service average - not even a single smile.

Food was delicious and enjoyed with creative desserts. I enjoyed the platter of sausages, ebi pasta, black charcoal waffles with sea salt caramel ice cream.

Visited here last night and after being in Singapore for six weeks I have to say this is the worst food we've had since we've been here.Should have sensed from the drinks initially - asked for a coke got a room temp can and a glass with one ice - so don't expect anything other than lukewarm coke!Wife had crab starter which seemed to consist of batter - couldn't see or taste any crab.I had the fish and chips - I mean how badly can you go wrong with such a simple meal - chips were ok tbh but obviously cooked in same oil as the fish - so tasted of fish. The fish seemed to be mainly batter 3 goujons - minimal fish and was inedible. Tartare sauce didn't taste anything other than mayo so couldn't even try and disguise the awfulness with the sauce.Wife had the salmon pasta - a burnt piece of salmon - the only thing she felt was ok was a couple of bits of asparagus that accompanied it.Having left the food 90 per cent consumed we paid out 52 dollars and explained it was awful - server simply said ah thanks very much - no apology no remedy - I've been sick last night and this am - down to the food am sure.It's expensive and disgusting - id avoid - perhaps their breakfasts are better but we won't be stepping foot in the place ever again - you have been warned people!

Been here years ago but only returned here after the makeover. The cafe has so much more character now, like a matured version of its initial format. The Four Favourites taste reasonable good but it was presented in a really unique way. Can't wait to try other dishes in future!!!

Popped in for breakfast. We had blueberry and banana pancakes and caramelized banana waffles with two flat white coffees food was great and service quick. The only thing I couldn't understand was why at 10:30 on a Saturday morning why the place wasn't packed! Loved it will go back.
