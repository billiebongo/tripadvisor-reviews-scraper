Nakhon is reasonably priced and the food is good. However, the service staff can be more organised and efficient. This outlet was closed due to hygiene purposes by the government last year.

Saw long queues so waited and entered. Big mistake. Party of 5, tables can seat only 4, so baby stool with your back touching next table. Food came in any which way including some wrong orders. Rice was dumped strait away on table 2 out of 3 plates ordered and was cold by the time rest of the food started arriving. Dishes like fried pork served without any sauces. Had to ask. Empty used plates kept piling up but waiters would just dump one more dish but not clear the mess. Last dish a garlic prawn was delivered when we had finished eating but was a tamarind gravy prawn. Dessert was even worse. Mango sticky rice had almost raw sour mango, no dessert or spoons, only forks available for eating dessert. Kitchen could be seen from our seat, most kitchen staff without masks or gloves ! Very noisy and staff screaming at the top of their voices. Terrible service for poor taste food. Eaten better and with better ambience in hawker center's . Not worth eating here and highly avoidable

First time patronizing the outlet at Holland Village. At 6pm there was a long queue of 20 already in waiting for a table. Customers are given a menu whole in the queue. Orders are taken before ushered to a table which hogged up the queue. We ordered beef green curry, seafood tom yam soup with milk, steamed tapioca with milk, thai milk tea, mango sticky rice, pineapple fried rice, basil minced pork, pandan chicken, papaya salad. Tom yam soup was too spicy to my liking.the rest of rest was the dishes were super good.The chef cooked prompty, and food was amazingly good. Definitely will visit again

We go this Thai restaurant often. It's honestly one of the best authentic Thai restaurants in Singapore and is priced very reasonably. You can find lots of Thai options in Singapore but Nakhon kitchen stands out as one feels like they are back in Thailand. Be prepared to wait for 15-20 min as there is usually a que to get a table in the evenings.

I have always enjoyed Thai food and I found my favourite Thai restaurant in Holland Village. Food is so so good, extremely delicious! The service staff is Thai and they are fast so don't expect little courtesies.. Watch out for them when they carry 7 plates of rice on one arm!!! If you are looking for that warm feeling n your tummy, try the tom yum soup (I love prawns!!!), Thai Mango salad, Green Curry Chicken and asparagus with prawns! The prices there are fantastic!!!Little secret - get there just before 6pm - no queue, no rush

This little joint serves close to authentic Thai food at really affordable rates despite being located here. Getting here is relatively easy as it is located near the Holland Village MRT station. There are not many tables so I would recommend arriving early for dinner or else the queue will get quite long. There are long tables for groups as well. One thing to note for those that prefer quiet eating places, the restaurant doesn't really cater towards diners looking for a quiet place as they literally blast Thai disco music non stop and it is as if you are in a club (no joke). But I would say this quirk adds to the vibe and the atmosphere. The food from being ordered to serve took less than 15 mins. The drinks came rather quickly too. We ordered; Mango Salad, Tom Yam Seafood with rice noodles, Pandan Wrapped Chicken, Spicey Thai Fishcake, Stir-fried Sambal Kangkong, Green Curry with Chicken, Pad Thai and Pineapple fried rice. None of the above-mentioned dishes are letdowns, and standards closely resemble dishes you find in Thailand. The total bill came up to $75, which was reasonable

I always wonder why there's always a long queue. After visiting the restaurant today, I must say the food is ok, price is fantastic, but I wanted to leave within 5 mins of seating down, just because the loud 85 dB music they were blasting throughout, ignoring my (and probably many others) multiple requests to lower the volume. No wonder they got my order wrong, I could hardly hear myself. Service was also non existent. As much as I want to rate the food, it's tough when you cannot enjoy it. Avoid unless you love to eat with planes taking off non stop
4
I always go there with a group of friends, so we can order a variety of different dishes. usually for 4-5pax we pay about $12-$16 per person. everything there is good however the queue is so god damn long sometimes. don't expect extreme good service from the wait staff because they are always so busy attending to a lot of hungry customers but be entertain by the music very interesting song list, its like having Thai food in a siam tiu. lo

It is a chain restaurant that offers genuinely decent Thai food at the fraction price of Thai Express, an embarrassing investment for the F&B conglomerate Minor Group from Thailand.Each dish is about $6-8 only. The ingredients are fresh and the flavour packs a punch. We look forward to going back for more
2
Most of the dishes we ordered were not on par with typical Thai food except for their tomyum. Their seafood was not fresh. Basil chicken taste horrible. Pad Thai was the worst! Thai milk tea and green tea were equally bad. Overall the food are bad, though the price was cheap. Not going there anymore
3
Authentic and good value Thai food. A long line soon formed, glad we got there early. A small restaurant with 50-60 seats only so get there early if you don't like waiting in line.

I wanted to try this place because I see long queues every time I pass by, so we finally tried it out today; little did I know what a bad experience I was in for. First the food was mediocre: watered down green curry, small bitty chicken parts, tough eggplant, bland pad thai. But I could have let that go, except for the unbelievably rude and disrespectful staff!! The music was blaring and two waiters I approached could not hear me or understand me when I asked for the drinks menu. I asked them to turn down the volume twice, and they were not minding me, so I went up to the cashier asking to talk to the manager. They had no manager, it was the cashier in charge who finally turned it down one notch. Meanwhile one female and two male waiters gave me defiant looks. The two male waiters even had the nerve to look at me belligerently. What for? For asking to turn down the music and requesting to be heard? The other customers told me it was no use, they asked too but were ignored. None of the other customers could not hear each other over the loud noise and they were shaking their heads. It was still quite noisy and difficult to hear, so I persisted with the cashier Mei, until she finally turned the volume down and only then was she able to understand my request for a drinks menu. After our mediocre meal, I paid and said thank you to the cashier, but the moment I turned around, she turned up the music even louder than the first time!! Apparently as an act of defiance? I saw all heads around the restaurant turn towards me and the cashier quizzically and customers were visibly stressed. I asked her again to please turn it down but she retorted, "That is how we are. It is only you who complain." How arrogant and uncaring and unbelievably rude. How much does it take to give in to a reasonable request, specially if it was done respectfully? The staff of this restaurant are the worst I have seen in Singapore, and that says a lot. It gives a very negative impression of Singapore service (even if apparently the staff are not Singaporean) and leaves literally a bad taste in the mouth. I will never go back to that place again, and I wanted to warn the people queueing under the sun not to waste their time. Really, so many other restaurants deserve the queue. For much better service and food quality, you'd rather be at Nara, E-sarn or even Thai Express. If I could give minus 3 stars to this restaurant, I would

Rushed to Nakhon kitchen having checked close was 945pm. Reached at 935pm and was told with marginal impoliteness, that the kitchen was closed. I asked them what time they closed to which one girl stated 945pm! Puzzled, I asked told her the time was still 937pm so if it was possible, to please check with the kitchen.That's when she launched into the most obnoxious tirade I have ever witnessed at a restaurant in Singapore!! Raising her voice to an extremely rude level (that to at my wife), she proceeded to show me the alarm clock at the counter which was 10 minutes fast and then said nobody runs on my time!! I told her in disbelief that the local standard time was exactly 10 minutes behind and the least they could do was change their operating hours listed to 935pm because we had made an unnecessary trip that we wouldn't have made. In any case, I understand her argument and point of view but my main issue is that it took her literally two seconds to raise her voice to an obscene level!I will not miss Nakhon and I know Nakhon will not miss me, but if you ever run into questionable service, please remember that they run on Nakhon rules and Nakhon time. This is Nakhon's world and we are all just living in it.

I went to Nakhon several times, and I must say the food is always amazing and reasonably priced. The service is fast and tables turn around pretty fast even when there is a long Q. The only negative part is the place is the pretty loud disco music they play
1
Used to be a big fan of the place, great food, efficient queue management and wait staffs as well as the amazing prices ! But this trip I noticed they have skimmed so much of the portion that's it's disappointing. Seafood tom yum with only prawn and few meagle squid rings, a tiny cube of fish... Not to mention the green curry chicken I ordered which I need to compliment the knife skills the kitchen staff has... Carpacio thin !

I've seen long lines for this place during meal times. Always wanted to try but won't Q. Happened to be in the area after lunch hour. And there was no Q so I decided to try it. Ordered a seafood horfun $4 and seafood coconut tomyum soup $6.The prices were reasonable and portion size ok. Horfun was abit little but with a side dish or soup, it was enough as a meal. The service is just normal, don't expect anything fancy. At first the waitress seemed curt but later on she seemed to warm up. The staff all seemed to be thai. So the food is "authentic". I guess. The taste of the food is ok. It's not wow but acceptable. I wouldn't Q for it. The crowd is mostly youth. Probably it's more attractive to the younger crowd. If you feel like thai food and there's no Q and you're in the area, why not? But I wouldn't go purposefully or Q for it.

Was in the neighbourhood during the weekend, and saw there was a long queue for this restaurant. Decided to try it out during lunch on one of the weekdays, definitely not worth the trip and waiting in the scorching sun for.The only thing that tasted authentically Thai was their fresh Thai coconut water.We had ordered Phad Thai, Plain Omelet, Tom Yum (Clear) Soup and Seafood Fried Rice. The foods were not served hot, and in fact they tasted nothing like Thai food at all. (Better off eating at Thai Express instead).Their music were way too loud, and they do not accept card payments, not even NETS.Had to pay in cash, but were short changed by their wait staff. In return I had checked with them about being shortchanged, to say the least, they were not one bit sorry

The Thai food here was definitely an appetite simulator. Must try the green curry chicken. The aromatic taste of it is irresistible. Comparatively, the Thai milk tea was so so. There's only 1 pricing for each item in the menu and the portion is enough for a maximum of 3-4 people. If you're going in groups, perhaps you might want to consider doubling the order. This place gets crowded during dinner time. We started queuing around 6:30pm on Saturday and when the food is served, it's 7:30pm already

Frequently the length of the line indicates the quality of the restaurant. The line was long but the food was Not great. Short greeting, no smile, no sawadeekahMenu (1 only) was already on the table. Very difficult to order as the wait staff NEVER scans the floor as they scurry about. The chicken had been fried earlier and was cold and hard, not made after it was ordered. The prawns were to be in a yellow sauce and, while the sauce was Very yellow it had a consistency like thick motor oil. This food was Barely Thai Food. My partner had to flag down a wait staff (again, not an easy task). After filling her glass he turned to leave- she pointed out that my water was also empty so, you know, how about Also filling that as well?We ate and left in a hurry. No, we did not! We requested the check after being ignored three times. The bill did not come! We got up to leave... that got their attention. Attempting to pay by visa we were shouted at with "no credit card! CASH!" Hmm we must have missed that notification. Why waste your time with crappy service and food? There are so many better places in Singapore, some 200m away from this place
1
Music was too loud, the place was extremely and unnecessarily NOISY with the servers shouting, chairs banging, music selection was good but the speakers were of bad quality so the music sounded like plain noise. It was playing too loud for one to enjoy a nice meal. The Pad Thai was like rubber. I usually feel reminiscent of my Bangkok trips whenever I eat out at an authentic Thai resto. I didn't feel reminiscent at all in this. Not recommended. Don't waste your time queueing here. Try out the Thai resto near ikea Alexandera Road instead.

superb menu, quick service, loved by consumers , friendly service, only cash payment, lot of dessert and juice options, Crew speaks Thai also !
4
the value for money here is incredible for Thai food.
I'm amazed by the price that we pay and for the quantity and quality of food received. only bad thing is the small space hence limited seating and the early closing time.
5
This place is by far the best place to have authentic and excellent Thai food. The ambience is great and do come early as there are often long queues formed as early as 10.30am.Pricing is also good and cheap and the service is fast as well as efficient

Ok ... it was Saturday evening so once you get over the 45 minute queue and then 15 minutes to wait for the food and the awful techno music ...... WOW .... the food made the wait so worthwhile .... the pandan chicken was tasty, moist and perfect; the red prawn curry had all sorts of yummy flavours dancing around my mouth; the salted egg long beans cooked to perfection; finally the authentic Thom Yam soup was ok. Probably the best Thai food i have had in my time in SGP.
3
i always visit this place whenever i crave for thai food. honestly, this place is a good place to get more authentic thai food. however, the staff looks like they are really super busy. its either really hard to get their attention or it takes really long for them to get you what you asked
3
Food: Good in terms of value for moneyService: The petite waitress with bun-up hair. Will suggest that you stay at home if you have a bad day - a botched up order does not render an insult on your customer, giving your restaurant a bad taste

Nakhon Kitchen has never failed me. Every time I am hankering for a nice quick casual Thai meal, their dishes hit the spot.I love their green mango salad, the balance of the sauce is almost always on point. Their Thai style kang kong is good too. If you are tired of the usual tom yam soup, give their tom saap soup a try. It is clear and lighter but still comes with a fiery kick in your mouth. This is my go-to dish whenever I eat here.Green curry used to be my favourite curry dish but their red curry has taken over. It's not as heavy but still has good full-bodied flavour to it. Dessert isn't that great but still enjoyable because their restaurant is usually very hot even on a cool day. I usually get the red ruby to share with my wife, they add strips of canned jackfruit that gives it that extra flavour.For casual Thai dining that's easy on your wallet, this is a great place for couples looking for a quick bite or for friends and family. Like most others have mentioned, be prepared to queue when you go during peak periods. Otherwise, if you do take away, you just need to wait 20-30 minutes for your food
3
Affordable & Authentic Thai food however be prepared to que easily up to 30mins Tom yum soup is spicy & tasty Deep fried porky is very tasty Tang Hoon is not worth the calories though Will go back to try their olive rice or pineapple rice if I the que is short
5
Came with family on rainy New Year's night , still there was a massive long queue when we left the outlet. Good tasting , quality Thai food at very reasonable prices. I only wish they stop playing the loud techno pop music, they probably play it to help turn the tables. Anyway, they are very popular and have around 5 outlets island wide , it's worth the waiting time in my opinion
5
Was craving some good Thai food, and this place delivered. Pretty good range in the menu, with the usual favourites like green curry, spicy morning glory. I was surprised when the bill arrived - much less than I had expected for the amount we ordered. Remember to try the omelette - it's off-menu so you just need to ask. And arrive early, because the queues can get really long. [This review is for the Pasir Panjang outlet.
4
Nakhon is really wallet friendly and they serve very delicious Thai food like Tom yum soup and the deep fried marinated chicken wrapped in pandan leave (Gai-hor-bai-toey):)) A must try at Holland V, and Pasir Panjang! Dii Maak Kha

We are staying nearby Holland Village and saw long queue especially this outlet. Yesterday, we have decided to try as we are craving for Thai food. We ordered Thai Pad Thai, Green Curry, and Thai Style Kang Kong. Food was delicious. We also had tried their mango sticky rice. Really nice and friendly team. Will come again

Last night we went to Holland Village to try out the Thai Food Store Nakhon Kitchen which was recommended to us from work colleagues. After a booking of table was not avail we had to face a very long Q at 7.30pm. While waiting for around 30 mins we could check out the menu and closer to the Restaurant they will take up your order already to speed up delivery later. Food was great, portions big enough, wallet friendly as well.As mentioned by other reviewers they music shouldn't be so loud or more traditional thai music. Overall a nice and joyful dine out

I am from Thailand and I love the food here. It is authentic and a cheap place to eat around HOlland village. You can go there and enjoy with friends and family. There is also a take away option for which you have to que for. They don't do home delivery unfortunately. I usually go eat there after 9 pm as the crowd has lessened by then. I really recommend this place 
4
We went there on mondah afternoon, the queue was already quite long. But it moves quite fast. We wait for about 30 minutes before we get the table. The waiter was verh helpful, ome of mh friends is pregnant and the waiter gave her a plastic chair to seat while queing. We sat inside the restaurant, which was unfortunate because they have this really loud disco mix music that's a bit too loud. But the food makes it alright to suffer the music. My favorite food of the night is prawns with salty egg and pad fhai, but all of my friends likes the tom yam clear soup the most. Overall, it was a very good dinner that we had.
4
The food tastes like back in Thailand and is really delicious. Prices are reasonable as well. The atmosphere is not the best if you sit inside, because the music is very loud and talking is almost impossible. If you can get a table outside it is perfect. Normally you have to Q, so come early :
5
I have been seeing the long queues in front of the restaurant for a some time because our Doctor is just around the corner. So I went for lunch yesterday and was totally stunned at how delicious everything was. So delicious I took my family there for dinner the same day. The honey chicken is a great dish especially for kids, mango salad is yummy. But be aware it is spicy! Also try the red prawn curry, sweet sour pork and cashew nut chicken. Will be back soon

Nakhon Kitchen has made a name for itself in Singapore as a preferred destination for authentic Thai cuisine. Its branch in Holland Village is among the newer expansions of this chain.The restaurant has a wide variety of dishes, each of which are well-cooked and served within minutes. The starters particularly the Pandan Leaf Chicken are incredible, in terms of the taste and also the price! The Tom Yum and Tom Kha soups are delicious and filling. The main course too more than lives up to its billing with the curries and the fried fish in Thai chilly sauce particularly noteworthy. For authentic and reasonable Thai cuisine in Singapore, this is definitely the place to go to
5
My Wife and I wanted to eat laksa at Holland village when we pass this place and it was filled with people. It was 5:40 pm and the queue hasn't started yet. We took the last table. The food was excellent and the prices were very affordable. $4 for a plate of Thai fried Kway Teow. Where to find?! Even hawker center is more expensive. Worth it
4
The food is very good and authentic, the prices are totally reasonable.
Service is very fast but not friendly at all. And I don't understand why they have this horrible loud techno music in the restaurant
5
A very efficient thai restaurant. Speedy and good service.
Great cheap Thai food. All staff seems Thai. Love it!
5
Very authentic thai flavors and the prices are very affordable. In fact its as good as any good restaurent in bkk. However the queue can be extremely long esp during weekends so go early!
4
This place was recommended, I passed by many times but finally sat down. The queue moves quickly and they are very considerate to offer you an umbrella against the hot sun. Orders are also taken in queue to speed up serving time and seating the next guests.Food was great and priced good
5
First time here and was introduced by the locals, definitely worth the try! Cooked and served by Thais, menu is not fancy but tasted good! Portion ain't too big so you can order more dishes to try and their price is very reasonable! Though u might need to go early as it'll be a long queue during dinner hours. Will list this as a fav food spot whenever i travel to singapore! Thumbs up!

Went there with my family for the first time at Holland V branch.We ordered the Green chicken curry ( chicken was sliced so thinly that it is almost not existence).Prawns with cashews ( prawns were not fresh)Pandan chicken ( okay)Pork with basil ( too spicy hot)Tom yum soup ( feels like it's out of a paste packet)Thai ice tea tastes exactly like ' teh Tarik' with ice.The only toilet is so dirty and the eatery has only just opened for business at 12pm so they cannot even blame it on customers.Music was so loud it's deafening.It was too painful to stay around for dessert.All in all, everyone in my party of 8 agreed that was the first and last time
4
Been here so many times but I just thought of doing a review of this place. The reason for my frequent visit is the delicious thai food. You don't have to travel to Thailand for a good thai food since the food served very much authentic. Some of my fav dishes are the honey chicken, tom yum, green curry and squid cooked in thai chilli. If you can't take spicy food, you got to be careful though. And if you are looking for a friendly servers or with good customer service, this is definitely not the place but their food is good so you can don't really bother about their service and not mentioning, they play loud thai music. Come on... just enjoy the moment. It makes you feel like you are in one of the restaurants in bangkok. Sawasdee krub

My family and I visited the Holland Village outlet a few days ago. Although the long line outside could be a deterrent, not to worry. The turnover is fairly quick. Even though there were perhaps 15 people or so in front of us, we were at our table in about 10 minutes. And while you wait in the queue, they give you a menu and take your order. And umbrellas are provided to get some respite from the sun, or rain, as the case may be.This is not a fancy restaurant. But it DOES serve really good food.We tried the mango salad, minced chicken with hot basil, beef in oyster sauce and pandan leaf chicken. We were not disappointed. Really authentic flavour. And my family and I are all foodies.The seating is pretty standard coffee shop type with plastic chairs. But the food is on the table as soon as they seat you. So you could be out in perhaps 20 mins or so.Well worth a visit just for the food

Nakhon Kitchen, synonymous with authentic and reasonably-priced Thai food, is conveniently located at Holland Village. Perfect for a quick lunch during our long lunch breaks!Though we went during the lunch crowd, we managed to find ourselves a table for 6, and we didn't have to wait too long for the food. This outlet is small, so we would have expected it to be slightly stuffy and cramped.Thai Iced Milk Tea ($3): Its unique orange-brown colour, rich creamy taste of the evaporated milk and slight bittersweet tinge totally won me over. Fried minced beef with hot basil leaves ($8): It was a tiny dish, with just a few tablespoonfuls of beef. Palatable, but the meagre quantity disappointed us.Pandan Leaves Chicken ($6 for 4 pieces): Having heard that it was one of the best dishes in Nakhon, we tried it out but it failed to impress. Though the fragrance of the pandan leaves were infused into the chicken, the meat itself was rather bland. Green curry with Chicken ($8): The viscous and mildly spicy curry was a welcome change from the normal red curry all Singaporeans are used to, but it was awfully hard trying to fish for the elusive mini chicken slices in the bowl...Seafood Tom Yum soup ($6): No Thai meal would be complete without Tom Yum soup. It sure left my tongue burning from the spiciness. The pineapple fried rice ($6) and stir-fried kang kong ($6) tasted decent enough. While Nakhon's prices are affordable for students, of course we have to give and take a little, so quantity is very much compromised and the taste is just satisfactory, nothing mindblowingly amazing. On the bright side, at least we got to try a variety of dishes to fulfil our thai food cravings without burning a hole in our pockets

o Tasty! o Authentic Thai food!o Inexpensive and affordable!i. Had a dinner with a friend, we had 4pcs of pandan chicken, pat Thai and pineapple fried rice for only 20SGD. x Long queue. x Loud music if you're sitting inside. x Can be sauna if you're sitting during a hot weather.x Finish your food and leave. No chit chat please. x Bad service! Urgh. (No interaction, no smile, totally not professional.)- I really despise restaurants, cafes or anything in FnB industry not honoring the importance of offering good service, especially when you have waiter/ waitresses! I cannot stress this enough
