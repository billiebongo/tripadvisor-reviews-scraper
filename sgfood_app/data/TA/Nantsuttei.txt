Surprised the place wasn't full on sunday lunch. Ramen is excellent, not too salty but tasty broth. Cha Su was authentic Japanese stuff. Enough appetisers like gyoza and age tofu to run out a nice snack. Most enjoyable.

Nice small outlet with efficient service. Ramen come in quite big portion. A little on the salty side but overall it is quite delicious. The side order of tofu seems to be a very good choice.

The service is good and the noodles are a sizeable portion. The sides on buta rice is delicious. I ate alot of ramen in Japan, only comment is the garlic flavour is not as rich as what I have in Japan. But it is still pretty tast

We went on a weekday for lunch and the lunch promotion was a good deal. You only need to top up $1++ for a side dish and cold brown tea. My daughter loves ramen but found the pork bone soup to be too rich and flavourful. She ordered the signature Nantsuttei ramen. We still prefer a less rich broth soup for ramen after all.

We ordered the signature house ramen with one slice of pork for under sgd11. For an extra sgd1, we enjoyed extra gyoza (dainty pan fried dumplings) or steamed dumplings or fried chicken, and free flow of iced japanese tea (ask for hot tea and you pay extra). Service was prompt and efficient.

Touted as a champion for ramen, this joint serves a variety and you can choose the spiciness as well as the texture of your ramen. We ended up meeting here as it was a favourite of our friend and old colleague. Simple setting and catering more to office workers, we could feel that we had overstayed by eagerness & tenacity of the service staff to clear the food from the table and their banging of neighbouring chairs! Food is so-so! The meat slice tasted pretty porky and the ramen at normal seemed overcooked. However, the joint seemed pretty busy over the lunch hour. Try if you like ramen

Food- Broth is good. If you need additional garlic, just ask. Funny thing this time, is that I got quite thirsty after drinking the soup. Hmm.. msg?!?Service- Similar service. yawn~~ Price- cost less than $35 for 2 ramen and 2 beer, during happy hour, including the service charges and gst.Value- ok as its orchard road..

Finally made it to taste test this ramen place given the positive recommendations. We ordered an original Nantsuttei Tonkotsu Ramen and the spicier Singaporean version, Dragon Ramen, with a side of Chicken Karaage with wasabi mayo. The textural combination of soft ramen with the crunchy bean sprouts and course slice of pork chashu was pleasant. The star of both ramen dishes was the glutinous pork broth that was sticky on the lips and finely balanced between tasty and salty. The deep fried chicken was a wall flower with wet crunch and wasabi hit.

If they close, I will die. Really. It is so goood, so simple and so good value for money. I love the butamabushi the gyoza and the age tofu. Ramen are also super good. Go there you won't regret it. I go there at least every 2 weeks.
