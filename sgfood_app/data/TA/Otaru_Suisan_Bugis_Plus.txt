Great experience. Value for money and staff were very friendly. Place was very neat & clean as well. Will visit again!

Since most Japanese restaurants are closed for the afternoon, this is the place to go if you have a craving for sashimi between meal times.

The food is yummy & there’s 1 for 1 Sapporo draft beer. Great place for dinner on Sunday night. Would be better if they serve dessert.

Affordable japanese food which has both normal seating and tatami cushion seats. It was something different from other japanese restaurants. Staff were attentive and prompt to our requests too. Wont mind going back if I was craving for japanese food!

Hostess was very friendly and knowledgeable about all the food they offer. Recommended me a great Japanese Island Tea cocktail as well which was off the menu, greatly appreciated it! Lunch sets are also very filling and enjoyable.

Nice ambience with friendly helpful staff. I went before 12.30pm on a weekday and it's surprisingly quiet. Service staff were attentive and patient! You have to remove your footwear at the dining area. Food was average.

I visited the restaurant during a lunch break and ordered the set lunch. After 30 minutes my food still had not arrived so I asked the waiter how long it would be and he said ‘not long’. After 40 minutes it had still not arrived so I asked once again how long my food would be and the waiter went to check with the kitchen. He came back and told me that the kitchen had forgotten to cook my food and that I would need to wait for them to cook it. He said it would be at least another 10 minutes.This was quite shocking because the restaurant had only 2 other tables with people eating and both were already eating their food when I arrived! Furthermore, the kitchen is open-plan so the chefs can see the restaurant and there were 4 waiters working. None of them seemed concerned at any time that I was sitting there for so long without anything to eat.In the end I had to leave without eating as my lunch break was over. I do not recommend this restaurant at all.

Had tried their four kind salmon bowl. I was quite surprise that the rice is warm, was thinking maybe they ran of sushi rice as I could see the kitchen staffs fanning the rice. I did ordered the meikajiki sashimi which was also not old was more to room temperature. Food and dining atmosphere is average
