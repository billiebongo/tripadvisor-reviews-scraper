My mom and niece were over from Europe and wanted to experience some local style and flavor.Along Joo Chiat Road we found Madam Low eating house. Its a perfect place to experience the local style and flavor. Plastic chairs and tables (Not outside anymore..why not??), loud guests, service hardly speaks english, but boy did we have good food and did we have fun! Beer is served by the Tiger Lady, wine not on the menu so BYO (no problem and no corkage).There are too many specialties, but the chicken wings are so crispy that even i eat them! The prawn roll, teh sweet and sour pork, crispy baby squid...mmm hungry again just thinking of it!If you want to experience the local spirit of Singapore in an awesome setting (Joo Chiat area is largely renovated in old style) this is the place to go

I was recommended to dine in here by a local upon my stay in Singapore.Although the folks were not speaking much of English, they were very accommodating of me and made sure that I got my needs.I had the salted fish fried rice and the wings and boy were the servings large! The fried rice itself would already make me full!Would definitely go back

Really unbeatable local food. We were regular customers there during our three-week stay at Betel Box (which, by the way, is a hostel we can also warmly recommend!), and enjoyed all our meals there. The lady boss is very friendly, and always had a smile for us. The food is always freshly cooked and promptly served, and the environment is very genuine, no pretences and no frills, very genuinely local. Really loved the experience
