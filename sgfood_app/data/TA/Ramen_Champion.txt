Good range of ramen. We ordered the tendon bowl too. Pricing was very reasonable. Nice, casual environment.
4
Have been visit here for few times, there are plenty of options for you to choose with different kind of ramen. Personally I like the Spanish ramen, it tastes good.

Ramen Champion at Changi Airport terminal 3, Singapore. Just wanted a hot noodle soup, this is the best place!
4
Food was nice (seafood ramen) and the service was prompt. Payment can be done using the Changi Gift Card.
3
If we have longer lunch break, we usually drive to Changi Airport for lunch. More selection and easier to get seats
5
Ordered ramen and ask for light soup. Texture is rich and noodles are soft. Worth going again. Next time can try other stall within the restaurant itself.
4
Great selectiom of ramen and side dishes. A little crowded during dinner time on weekends, ventilation a little less than ideal but not a big issue.
Food was pretty decent.
5
Bought my family there for Ramen and tendon set. Food is yummy and great casual ambience for dinning. We can deposit our luggage outside the restaurant, which the staff gives us a number tag for collection later. Will visit again.
5
Service was excellent with the manager trying his best to serve the weekend crowd. Ambience was OK though not spectacular. Variety of food was decent and quality was good.

Located in basement 2 of Terminal 3, this outlet serves Japanese food (mostly ramen) in a self-service "food court" style, with multiple different stalls competing for your business. On entry, you are given a plastic disc token against which your purchases are registered. Tried Sapporo miso ramen; it was available relatively quickly. Taste was OK, if a bit salty. Tables are separated between outer ring, with a view of the entrance, and inner room, which was a bit dark. Space is quite cramped, and not much of a view. It's self-service all the way. Marked down for cost, as it was a little bit more than comparator outlets serving similar fare in the shopping centres
3
My first visit to this restaurant, cosy atmosphere and polite staff and chef. Ramen is yummy, but abit expensive. Chicken katstoo hard
4
Very impressed with the wide variety of options available. Service was prompt and friendly, would definitely visit again.
4
Lesser choices at this outlet, but the ramen is still as good. God Ramen from Buta God Ramen was da Bomb!
5
Love the marche style. Was wary of losing the token key during the whole experience. food and service was great. Would be even better with set meal for weekend dinner too.
4
This place has good ramen at an affordable price, and it is a good alternative when the food court is too expensive. However, the wait might be longer when they have a lot of guests.
5
the staff was very accomodating by seating my family together even though we booked two tables. the food was yummy as usual.
4
There were individual stalls sellling foods like gyoza, ramen and rice bowls.. pretty interesting concept, and you were charged for the food to a tag that was presented to you, and the cashier would then present you the bill at check out at the counter.Overall, food was yummy.. a little of the high side.. but is about the price for food that one would normally pay for in the airport
3
We were spoilt for choice given the many choices of Ramen available. We ordered a Ramen and Tendon together with spicy toufu, chawanmushi and a drink. Overall the food were tasty but I felt they were overprized given the small portion of the food served. We even need to pay for the wasabi and sauce for the tempura which was a 'chef recommendation'
5
This is by far one of the best ramen restaurants in Singapore in terms of taste and affordability. There are different stalls within the restaurant itself so there is a wide variety of dishes. You can get octopus balls or prawns if you like.For $15, I usually buy a bowl of Special Ramen from one of the stalls. It is great and delicious. The soup is especially tasty and it sets this bowl of ramen apart from the rest.The service is great and whenever I go there, I can always find a table within 10 minutes
4
Firstly, it was easy to make a reservation using Chope. When we arrived (although 20 mins early), our table was ready. There was a wide selection of Ramen base soup variety of soup base to choose from, plus a selection of accompanying meats and side dishes. A satisfying dinner experience.
4
The shop itself have 5 different stores inside selling different soupbase ramens .. and is really good taste.. clean and fast services
4
We just went for a quick ramen and it surprised us how good it is! We'll be back again. The place is not fancy but it tastes really good!
4
Nice place to have a bowl of authentic japanese ramen. Place was crowded but the order did not take long to prepare. Only shortfall was the quantity was a bit little and selection are similar the same at all the stores.
5
Went here last sunday. Was not crowded at all, nice place to have conversation. Tried tonkatsu ramen from menya-ryu. Love it so much! Almost similar to tonkatsu ramen i tried in japan. Recommended!
4
This is a good place to have a Ramen. The service is good.The prices similar to other ones. This restaurant is good for a quick meal.
4
The ramen served the Restaurant was quite tasty and portion was quite big. They also serve supper hot ramen for those want to try it.

Was walking around the airport deciding on what to eat when we came across this outlet. There are a few stalls here including Menya Ryu, Torimaru and Buta God. Opted for the spicy ramen at Menya Ryu. Hubby ordered the Sapporo Spicy miso ramen (level 1 spiciness) and I had the Tonkotsu Red miso ramen (level 2 spiciness).Enjoyed the authentic Japanese dinner. The Sapporo Spicy ramen came with thicker noodles and soup base was thicker. The Tonkotsu Red ramen used thinner noodles with a thinner soup base. Both were equally delicious. From Mon to Thurs, from 5pm - 10pm, there is a daily special if you were to order a ramen dish. Hubby also commented that it the ambience didn't feel as though we were in the airport. One hour free parking is available for patrons too. Terms and conditions apply
4
This place is at Changi terminal 3 basement 2, a collection of few different ramen stalls. None assuming place, would recommend coming here for ramen, green tonkotsu ramen especially. They added spinach in the soup base, making it green. The spinach balances the rich bone soup flavour very well
2
I ate here several times in the past but the standard seems to have dropped in my recent visit. The gyoza tastes like those sold in Supermarkets while the noodle broth I ordered was so salty! I couldn't taste the meat flavours, only the extreme saltiness. For $18.80 a bowl I thought it was not value for money. My friend ordered a kimchi ramen which was even more salty but at least he liked the spiciness of his broth. Even the mango iced tea tasted horribly plasticky and the yuzu drink didn't have any yuzu flavour at all (more like lemon). The only good part of the meal was the free flow of napkins...
3
It's was very oily and and of course tasteful for the first time. And the last bit of it I feel awful. This time around we ordered noodle, ramen with unagi rice set and ramen with pork dumplings. Noodle has very strong of pork oil taste. Some people may like it. Not that oily this time but very salty. The ramen is chewy and not too thin and thick. The unagi rice was okay too, they can use better rice. Pork dumplings was good too, I will go back for the dumplings
3
If you are visiting Singapore I'd say skip this place, there are many other options. But if its a rainy day and you want to stay indoors the Great World City location had great service and the food is ok.
4
Ramen champion always seems to have mixed reviews however my spicy ramen from Buta God (level 3) was great!! I would definitely eat here again.. I would mention that level 3 was very very spicy...
4
If you have long hours waiting at the airport and craving for hot soup, it's one good option to try. With big portion, tasty soup, and lots of pork meats, I think it is worth try menu in T3 Changi
3
This restaurant have 3 different store that have been award the best ramens. Different store taste differently but is better than Ajisen ramen but overall not bad the food
Should go to middle store and award store because is recommended to eat there
4
We went on a weekend so it was quite crowded and we had to wait a while for the orders to be ready. Tried from different stalls - actually the items all sounded similar. The special spicy ramen wasn't too spicy at 50%. But many slices of pork and the egg was authentic! Broth wasn't too salty either, just right :) will definitely return again.
4
We had two ramen in Ramen Champion, Singapore, which were Tonkotsu Miso Ramen and Special Tonkotsu Ikkyu's Ramen. The first slurp of the Ikkyu's ramen was so delicious and tasty. The thin noodles picked up the creamy broth, indulging every slurp with the impeccable broth. However, it became too much for the last half of the ramen. The Tonkotsu Miso Ramen was not as tasty and delicious as the Ikkyu's. Ironically, I think - with these two ramen champion -, the star of the feast was Ikkyu's side dish, the Cod Fish Tofu
4
Basically, the atmosphere of the I had at this place was kinda nice. A soothing environment for a place to eat ramen is definitely provides a great settings as well as atmosphere for some Japanese noodles. Anyhow, yes the menu was rather simple to understand and order was done using an iPad to hasten the process as well as to minimize miscommunication during order. Kudos to that.Moving on to the ramen i had, it was very filling. It was not to say the best ramen in the world or just a moderate quality, but it was nice and delicious to eat. My personal experience with Ramen Champion was simply nice.Hence in a nutshell, if you're looking for some noodles without searching for perfection in ramen-ation, give this place a try..! :
4
Went to Ramen Champion @ T3 for lunch. There are so many stalls, but we went straight to Tonkotsu lkkyu. The pork bone broth was rich but not too oily. The char siew was tender. My favourite was the ajitsuke tamago, it was done perfectly with a smoky flavour
3
Got in on a late evening flight and since I had a huge piece of luggage, decided on a restaurant rather than the foodcourt. Being a ramen fan (especially Ippuddo in Shanghai), thought I would give it a try.There are several ramen 'stalls' within, and you place an order at the stall using a tag. In return, you are given a buzzer which will tell you when the meal is ready - totally efficient.Being there for the first time, I followed their recommendation to get a Special Ramen and a original gyoza. The ramen noodles were nice and chewy, but the meal slices were really thin and, more importantly, the soup stock was not rich. The six gyozas, which largish, were rather bland in taste. And the meal came up to $22.80, which I felt was expensive.Anyway, a lesson learnt
3
We came here for a family day out a few months ago on a rainy day in Singapore. Plenty of ramen to choose from, with some significant quality differences. The gyoza was good, but my ramen ended up being a bit too oily. If you're passing through Changi Airport on a long transit stop it's worth trying to find this place, but as an end-point destination for food for Singapore residents I probably wouldn't recommend it. Easy to find in the T3 basement mall
4
Be it at the Iluma Mall or Changi T3 outlet, it never failed to awe us with their variety of ramen from 6 prefectures.
3
While trying to find a way to spend my 7 hour layover we stumbled upon this place in the basement of the Changi airport. My experience with ramen is extensive. This place was exceptionally good for an airport restaurant but below standards for a traditional Japanese ramen joint. My main issue was the broth. Although you have allot of different "vendors" to choose from I felt it lacked that dedication much smaller ramen joint has. With that the broth suffers, and I felt it lacked depth. But again, for airport food you're not going to find much better
3
There are a few shops within this quaint place in Terminal 3 Changi International Airport that sell different flavours of ramen and appropriate side dishes like gyoza.There is considerable variety so take time to see the offerings from each individual shop. We had the Ajitama Ramen - mediocre quality but great as a tummy filler before you board your flight

Visit: http://dairycream.blogspot.jp/2013/10/ramen-champion-mendokoro-aoi-versus.html for full post and picsTwo new popular Tonkotsu brands from Japan, namely Mendokoro Aoi and Tonkotsu Itto have been handpicked by Ramen Champion from Gunma and Tokyo respectively. We had quite a good start with the appetizers, Prawn Dipping Sauce with Cracker($4) from Mendokoro Aoi and Gyoza ($6) from Tonkotsu Itto. The Prawn Dipping Sauce tasted quite mild (didn’t really have the prawn-like flavor), but overall it still tasted good with the cracker.The gyoza was pretty good, considering the fact that it specialize in ramen though I would prefer gyozas at Osaka Ohsho. Next up, one of the highlights at the food tasting, Mendokoro Aoi’s Tonkotsu-Ramen Champion ($16.50) by Chef Kazuo Sakuraoka. The ramen presentation did reduce my excitement a little, however the white cloudy ramen broth was nice, light, flavorful. It does not contain the smell of pork bones. It’s one of the lighter tonkotsu broth which I’ve tried thus far. If you love tonkotsu but don’t like some of the heavier, oilier versions elsewhere, you might like Mendokoro Aoi. Perhaps one of the few minus points would be it was served rather lukewarm, not piping hot as I expected. The Chashu was slightly overcooked thus a tad too soft for my preference, though the thin layers of fat literally melts in my mouth. Well, at least the noodles were not too overcooked. Strangely, the Ajitama (flavoured egg) was under-cooked with runny egg whites. In contrast, Tonkotsu Itto’s Special Tonkotsu Ramen ($16.50) (by Chef Yukihiko Sakamoto) is prepared in the traditional tonkotsu way where the pork-based soup is cooked for several hours to allow the essence of the pork bone to fill up the base. The ramen looks very appetizing (as compared to Aoi) and the portion was generous here, with big slices of tender Chashu conquering half the entire surface of the bowl. I felt a tinge of disappointment after tasting the broth though this Hakata style of ramen (albeit originated from Tokyo) boasts the taste of rich pork-bone tonkotsu broth with rather thin, non-curly, resilient noodles. Like in most ramen-ya, the use of Chashu is not restricted to ramen. A pretty good side dish was Mendokoro Aoi's Chashu Carpaccio($7)--a sliced chashu salad garnished with tomatoes, onions and peanuts. We've also had Garlic Butter Potato Wedges ($5), deep-fried Tofu (Agedashi Tofu) with Japanese Sauce($4) and Sukiyaki Bun ($3).To find out who won the ramen battle this time round, visit: http://dairycream.blogspot.jp/2013/10/ramen-champion-mendokoro-aoi-versus.htm

Go to http://freshffm.blogspot.sg/2013/08/bario-ramen-muscle-car-of-ramen-world.html for our full review with photos!(Do note that this stall is only in the Ramen Champion at Bugis+)My first sip of the broth, as always, brought me into a different place altogether, its taste being as rich as ever. From one mouthful alone, it's pretty hard for the first-timer to ascertain the individual components of the soup (pork base, Bario's special soy sauce, garlic, pepper, and the incredible bits of fat). But there's no need for in-depth analysis here; Bario's soup just blows you away completely and is unlike anything I've ever had, leaving you utterly speechless while your tongue scrambles to comprehend the sheer awesomeness of it all. To say it's merely intense would do it no justice at all. That first sip of Bario's soup has a good case to be one of the highlights of my, and anybody else's, life.The beansprouts and cabbage piled high on top of the noodles may look intimidating, but they conceal the true monster lurking underneath -the enormous pile of thick, flat, chewy noodles..

Liked the fact that it is located in Changi Airport as the airport is less crowded. Good spread of different ramens. From thick to thin ones. Recently noticed more rice offerings from different store. Good because some individuals in the shop may not be ramen fans and just wanted some rice meals.Loved the options of upsizing or adding noodles. Very economical way of ordering food for children especially when they do not eat full portions.Recently like the store right opposite to the drink stall. The noodle is a thicker version yet very bouncy. Loved the garlic and loads of vegetables. The Cha Shu does not have the porky smell compared to another stall in the shop. Good. Still thinking about the ramen while writing. Yum yum

I'm not a big fan of ramen but being at the airport on a busy Sunday, chose to eat at this establishment as it was the only place we could be seated quickly. Its concept of being a sort of ramen food court was an interesting one, with four different styles of ramen from various parts of Japan represented. All in all, there were a bewildering range of ramen dishes ranging from meat-based to vegetarian, and savoury to spicy. One stall also had a small selection of Japanese curry rice. You select the dish(es) at the individual stalls and have the order electronically recorded on a sort of charge card. Once the dish(es) are ready, it's self-service.Feeling a need for spicy, I chose a bowl of chilli pork cutlet ramen. Huge bowl with generous portions of pork cutlet, bean sprouts, and garnishings. Unfortunately, I was disappointed that the spiciness came from a sort of chilli oil which made the entire meal rather greasy and difficult to finish. Rather pricey for a bowl of ramen but it was probably similar to prices in Japan (equivalent of between 800-1200 yen)

This is the smaller branch of Ramen Champion which started in Bugis+ (then known as Iluma) sometime in 2011.There are fewer choices here but the environment is quite nice. Although definitely not the best Ramen in Singapore, I would say that the ramen served here are of a consistently decent quality. However if you have healthy tastebuds (less oil, less salt, less everything unhealthy), then you will probably not like the food here. I personally don't mind food that is oily and salty, so your mileage may vary with the taste you get here

We had it at T3 during early January.. Ramen was springy though.. the soup tastes ( -_-) full of Msg.. my friend had the pork katsu, rice with curry and the portion was pathetic.. the curry was basically cold.. However,the place was clean and atmosphere was very active & welcoming.. Well folks, there are better tasting ramen out there with the similar price range.. I would recommend one of my favourite place for Ramen which is at Orchard (Somerset), Cuppage terrace.. Taste of authentic basic ramen, Shoyu or Miso flavours are my favourites.. if you drop by after/around 8pm, you may see/meet some Japanese staying in local, slurping the ramen away.. :)

I went to Ramen Champion at Bugis± with three friends. We arrived around 8pm on a Saturday and found it to be very busy. The ambiance is nice and it is a fun place to go because they make it feel like a competition between chefs.We tried the Ramen from three different stalls along with the Gyoza from one. Overall the food did not impress, we all felt that it was good but for the price it does not compare to some of the better Ramen places in Singapore
