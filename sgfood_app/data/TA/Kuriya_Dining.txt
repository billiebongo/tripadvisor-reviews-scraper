Good Japanese sets and excellence service. Nice and quiet ambience. The food is fresh and good quality. They have unique white sesame ice cream. Good place for business guests too
4
Overall Ambient is good and the sushi is fresh. We are all well taken care especially for the children where the chef is very accomodative.

Kuriya didn't disappoint. The dishes were so authentic yet there was touches of fusion. The sashimi was also served with a truffle paste. Their California roll was also served with a spicy sauce. It was a very enjoyable experience. The service was impeccable.

Quite a pricey place but the quality is GOOD i must say! We had the sashimi and it was greaaaaaaaat! Everything in the bowl was so fresh and sweet! It was swept CLEAN in just few minutes! LolThe next time I think of eating Sashimi, this place definitely comes top in my mind!Highly recommended but mind you, it is pricey too!

This is a review of Ami Ami by Kurosawa Dining, located next to the main outlet. Nice plating, and fresh seafood. However, it is too pricey for the food quality (which is good but not sufficiently premium), as well as the d√©cor and service (which are definitely casual)
4
The restaurant is spacious, elegant, with private rooms. To access this restaurant, you exit the building at ground level from the office block end, and enter from behind the left pillar. The service was good, friendly and very attentive. We ordered a few set dinners, all satisfactory. The Kurobuta pork was very delicious, tender and fragrant. The Wagyu beef in pumpkin soup was rich and interesting. The matcha ice cream was low sugar and velvety. I was very impressed to find the salt content low for all my dishes including the Miso Soup.

The best Japanese in Singapore if you like your sushi super fresh, sustainably caught; every little dish we tried was elevated from the standard Japanese fare at other top-end respectable Japanese restaurants. Even the green tea was better! The service is exceptional, ambiance is perfect. Highly recommend the lunch specials but even those will cost you a pretty penny... And, don't even think you can just walk-in, you will see a notice on the door that they are fully booked. Reservations are a MUST

I was at Tampines Kuriya - after I bought the food and asked the Manager to cut it for Sashimi - he throw the food to the table for the person to cut it. This is how the service you will get if you come to Tampines 1 Kuriya - worst than being treated like animal. Totally poor service value for money is worst than I ever get

I usually come here for business lunches. The food is good and fresh. They have special set meals that change regularly. Also offer seasonal dishes. When I visited yesterday for lunch, the lady manager offer us special grill fishes that's not on the menu. When we told her we are in a hurry, she timed our order very well and we were able to finish our lunch on time despite a pretty full restaurant. We'll usually request for a room. A minimum of $350 is required. The room we had was good for 8 pax. Servicing staff are very polite and attentive. The set lunch is value for money
5
Have been eating here for 10 years and the food is top grade, and versatile because you can have set lunches, multi course, or ala carte at differentiate budgets but what makes the place really special is the staff, many whom have been with the restaurant the same period I've been there. The prices are not cheap but the quality you get cannot be faulted and is probably better value than some over-hyped celebrity restaurants. Recommend to make reservations.
5
I have dined at Kuriya on several occasions and i have enjoyed each and every visit. The sashimi is very fresh, and the dishes are well presented. The service staff are approachable and forthcoming. Overall one of the better Japanese restuarants in Singapore.
5
Invited by friends n found this Jap restaurant with one of the best services n yummy food. Quite an expensive place to eat but for the desire to experience what a five star Jap restaurant is, it had to be Kuriya!
5
Every dish is of except exceptional quality. Starting with the sushi, Shabu-Shabu, grilled fish collar, unagi- don, yakitori, sushi, soba... service was personable and attentive. It seems have become a place where the family come for celebrations.
4
The ambience was pleasant and comfortable. The warm service added the extra touch. The set dinner is good value for money.Eating the appetizers told me that there will be no compromise on quality. I was not disappointed. I ordered the grilled eel set which was more than substantial, with all the other accompanying dishes
4
The menu at Kuriya Dining offers something for everyone who loves Japanese cuisine. Their shabu shabu service is especially nice if your friends like to share a big meal. The seafood is fresh, flavorful, and changes monthly depending on what's in season. But what sets this restaurant apart from many others is their child policy. If you have children under 6 in your party you are requested to dine in a private room which includes an extra charge. The effect of this policy is that the restaurant is peaceful and conducive to lingering and talking with your friends without excessive noise.
4
Not just good produce but service is second to none. Always attentive staff, always delivering the best service. In just 3 weeks. It was my third visit here. Every visit, leave me a very contended diner.Best deal. Their set lunch is always very good. You have the option for a small fee of $20, to change the sashimi to sea urchin/toro. Twice, I did that on their set lunches. Another time, you add an option sea urchin for $30. Best to book as it's always packed to capacity.The place to be for simply the best produce in town
5
If you are new to great Japanese fine dining, Kuriya at Great World City may be your answer.Was invited for lunch thee by a medical doctor Friend of mine who is a regular patron n upon arrival , we were warmly welcomed n ushered to our own private corner of the restaurant. I do know a bit of fine Japanese dining but pretended to be a novice just to test the manager.He introduced n recommended a few dishes n I let him decide on what I should have.Must add that his choices were awe fully yummy n I enjoyed the food, the environment n the controlled 'interruptions' by the manager n his service staff which gave us time to eat n chat unlike some restaurants where the service staff can be quite annoying
4
I have organized a special luncheon event on 19 Aug @ Great World City branch. Staff were efficient especially their manager, Paul Lui. He seem to know what the customer needs without told. I realized he spoke very gentle towards his customers and also his service staff too. Respect is to be earned. He is a valued asset to Kuriya Management. My event were not gone smoothly and successfully without them. I had a pleasant and relaxed corner executive lunch without any disturbance. They handled my event well
4
I must admit, I went to this restaurant because they have a strict no children under 6 policy. I hate having a nice meal ruined by screaming children! Having said that the service here is divine. They treated everyone very well and there were obviously a lot of repeat guests. We went for lunch and had lunch sets. We enjoyed the sushi and sashimi as it was very fresh. The tempura was also very nice. The only disappointment was the yasai roll which turned out to be just avocado and lettuce. It was more like salad then vegetables. I was hoping for asparagus or something a little more upmarket than lettuce. We also found the sets to be good value for money. We will definitely return to this gem of a restaurant
4
Good things don't come cheap and you have to pay a premium for quality. Kuriya epitomises this beAutifully. Japanese cuisine at its loving and caring best. Menu options are elaborate and will take you to many agronomist Japanese delights. You will have to come again to savour the experience again. Must try for great experience and great service
5
Lovely Japanese food with great service! We like coming here for their set lunches. Not cheap but quality was quite good. Kelly, Yuki, Mario and Raoul have been most helpful and attentive!
3
Great Japanese dining - sashimi. Not the best sashimi, but worth what you are paying for.
Buy fresh fish from the market side. Also have sashimi grade fish, fish skin to deep fry, other sushi ingredients.
5
Very good option for a Japanese cuisine fix. Attentive staff offering great service. Fresh sushi and sashimi options along a nice selection of traditional warm dishes.
5
This restaurant is inside Great World shopping centre. Food had always been good and the sashimi fresh. Have never been disappointed so far, good place for lunch and dinner for business lunch too. They have good value set lunch too and wagyu beef set.
5
One of the best restaurants I have visited, wonderful attentive service and some of the finest sushi/sashimi I have ever had. Was taken here by a business colleague for an early evening meal. really fantastic, highly recommended.
5
We have been visiting Kuriya regularly for the past 4 years. The outlet in Great World City is awesome. Food is fresh and of good quality. Lunch menu is varied and pricing is good. Popular choices are the monthly special based on the seasonal special, Kuriya Gozen, Special Nigiri Sushi and Aburi Beef Set. The staffs are professional and friendly. Service is prompt and the manager Paul makes an attempt to remember the regulars and greet the guests
4
Fast and delectable! Finished a 3-course Japanese lunch in less than 1.5 hours. Fresh salad in a tangy dressing was a great starter. There was a fairly extensive choice of mains - from sushi to sashimi to tempura and more. We had the gindara teriyaki set and the nigiri sushi zen. Both were very good. Fruits with ice cream and coffee/tea completed the meal very nicely. Service was efficient.
5
Japanese food is not my first choice, but a business lunch took us to Kuriya. The tempura set meal was wonderful - delightfully crisp light batter coated prawns and vegetables, along with the ubiquitous rice and miso soup.Service was relaxed but very attentive.Would definitely visit again
4
Seems like too many lunches n dinners but asked to pick my favourite place for lunch. I have no hesitation to pick kuriya @ great world. The place is cosy, delivering the best n fresh produce flown in from Japan. I suggest if they tell you we received fresh fish. Ask the price per head before going ahead with their offerings because we were stung with a $1500 bill the last time for 5. No liquor nor drinks simply tea.As its my birthday treat. I decided to opt for the $68 kaisei set upgrade with sea urchin n toro for an additional $20.I asked the beef fried rice to replaces with anything other then beef. They were happy to do it n told me that salmon fish will be served instead of beef. Surprisingly, when the fried rice came. I wasn't paying attention to detail n ate 1/3 of it to realised it was beef. Other than this incident. Everything was good. KThe meal for a good Japanese meal to impress.
5
Kuriya dining is consistently one of my favorite mid-range Japanese restaurants in Singapore. They have both lunch and dinner sets that are very good value for money. The fish quality is always excellent and service is always great. The food here never disappoints no matter what I order! Their lunch sets are more affordable which lets you try many new things and they also have a loyalty card. If you are looking for more of a fine dining experience, you can venture off the set meals and go for some of their other dishes. The uni pasta is delicious, and you can never go wrong with fresh sashimi
3
I give this place a 6/10 rating, in terms of food quality and price for Singapore standard. If I compare to similar places in Japan, it would be a 5/10.
5
My favourite fine dining restaurant for Japanese food. Everything is top notch here from the food, ambiance right down to service. I particularly like the sashimis here as it is super fresh. Pricey but worth it!
4
The service provided by their staff is excellent. Not to mention the food...is fresh and tasty. Good place to be wif friends or family.

4 of us, classmates n friends for 40 plus years. Whenever one of us suggest Japanese. This is the ultimate place to be. At least for us although I am sure there's more Japanese restaurants that's as good as Kuriya dining.We would always book the private room with a minimum spent of $100 per head. It's not difficult to overcome that figure as often we wound go for their monthly set to incorporate the sea urchin n toro. It's my favourite. A must have over here. Someone, on our visit the manager told us that a imported Japanese fish arrived only late last night that we should have a GO. Anyway, it was supposedly FISH lunch or seafood for today.First was one full amazing whole fish platter with all .... Sashimi style, you name it .. Sea urchins, toro, scallops, prawns, tuna, ....Next comes, tempura delights, another fried whole snapper, a pork dish cooked to perfection, the whole head from that special imported Japanese fish was deep fried. Finished off with a massive fruit platter of Japanese delights .... So sweet @ Rock melon, apples n oranges.Expensive ? S$1500 without any liquor. So, it's much but again it serves the freshest seafood in town. If you were approached to try their specials? Ask for a price but to my classmate, it's a small sum to pay as long as all of us are happy together.Enjoy

Kuriya Japanese Restaurant at Great World City , Singapore has been our family favorite for special events or a treat for the family . We like the quiet and understated decor . Private rooms for family or small groups make it intimate and cozy . The food selection is superb , with a varied selection to satisfy everyone's taste . Needless to say , the service is excellent . Best of all we get value for the excellent food at Kuriya

Service is a challenge in Singapore given a tight labour market. Kuriya has got it right - a culture of top notch service where waitresses OBSERVE and take proactive action (e.g. topping up your tea; removing dishes, replacing them with clean ones). Few restaurants get their batter for tempura right. Kuriya's is excellent and for $45 a set, is amazing value. The dessert is yummy (strawberry mousse, chocolate ice cream and a colourful combination of fresh fruits. It will be our chosen haunt for Japanese foo

This got to be the best Japanese restaurant and the most expensive one I've ever been to. The dinner set is really worth it. It consists of appetizer, sashimi, steam item, choice of main, rice, soup and dessert. The sashimi is really fresh and delicious. They serve the best unagi sushi I've ever tasted so far. Overall, the quality is excellent but too expensiv

Called in on advice from friends to check out and was not disappointed. Had the 5 course sushi menu and staggered away full. Service was most impressive and the girls helped me through some food I have not tried before. Food was fresh and sushi quality bream, scallop, conger eel, prawn, salmon roe, crab and other fish of the day was excellent. Finished off with fresh fruit and black sesame ice cream.Didn't try but looked an extensive Sake and Shoju menu
5
We have been to Kuriya so many times, we always leave happy and satisfied, be it lunch or dinner. We have always been greeted with a smile, the service is excellent, with attentive, very friendly staff, who know their food and will always recommend the fresh food for the day! How lovely is that! The restaurant is just about right, not too big, nice furnishings, with a few Private Dining Rooms.Their menu serves up a good variety of alar carte and set lunches and dinners for you to choose from. We enjoy sitting by the counter, to see all the chefs busy preparing food! They do have quite a nice selection of Sake too!Value for money, consistent quality of food and excellent service. Kuriya is a place I will recommend to friends and family. Do make reservations as they are always full

I've dined here about half a dozen times and kept forgetting to put words on paper, even after a spectacular sea urchin feast a couple of months ago. There are cheaper places to eat good Japanese and much more expensive restaurants but for me Kuriya represents excellent value for money as the food is consistently good and you would be hard put to find better waitstaff. Besides sea urchin, I am a big fan of unagi or eel and the unagi bento lunch meal here is spectacularly good. Unagi is a fatty/oily fish and it's strong flavour puts off some people. But properly grilled and seasoned with teriyaki sauce, it is not just a tasty meal but also a healthy one. My wife had the chilled roast beef with potato cream sauce and tempura set. Wafer thin slices of rare beef in a sauce that brought out the full flavour, taste and texture of the beef. The tempura was perfectly done too and we have always loved the chawanmushi and miso soup served here. The service is always attentive but not intrusive. This is one of our favourite Japanese restaurants
3
Had a lunch with my client recently . We chose the set menu which tasted not too bad but just OK. It is a decent Japanese restaurant but I would not say an outstanding one.

Overall dining experience was wonderful, starting from the great ambiance, attentive staff and authentic Japanese cuisine.

Currently our favourite Japanese restaurant even though some of the dishes come in relatively small portion. But the food has been always good, so far.

Not too bad. But I prefer the main restuarant at Shaw Centre

A Japanese restaurant operating with the basis of a Chinese restaurant, introducing their menu mostly with a very strong Tagalog-accented tone, and presenting very hard with a Western fine dining ambiance (hardly).Was there days ago to celebrate my birthday. A treat from my lovely wife supposedly. She called in earlier in the week explicitly telling the reservation crew that it's a special occasion and would love to have a private and quiet corner. We did get a corner table, glaring at us from behind is a row of nice cubicles, which I suppose are more important guests or those who pay cover charge. Attentiveness and Thoughtfulness as most Japanese outlets would have - 0/100.Had my menu and choices recited more than twice and after numerous begging of pardons. It was easier ordering a bottle of coke at a roadside stall in Cambodia. Pronunciation - 65/100.Saw men and women in uniform shirts greeting and making rapport with some group of patrons seemingly regular at the restaurant. We agreed it was a Chinese Hong Kong yum char place then was confused by the sashimi in the plates... Hong Kong/Chinese ambiance - 80/100. Coupling that, patrons allowed to be laughing and talking loudly, especially from the 4 snobbish seemingly rich-looking patrons a table across added onto our suspicion if we were in a Japanese restaurant. Noise - 95/100.And the occasional shouts of "Mah Seh!" from the staff behind me. I seem to magnet the favoritism from the staff to be greeting incoming guests from behind me. I wished I could correct their poor Japanese pronunciation, but I was too much in shock. If I were pregnant, I would have suffer a miscarriage seriously no joke. The greetings in Japanese restaurant was with life & passion and not just volume level. Thrilling factor - 95/100.Comfortingly, the fishes were one of the freshest I have tasted in the country. Though the presentation and the overall taste was not to die for. Fresh fish - 100/100
5
This restaurant deserves a higher rating than this. It serves consistently good Japanese food. Staff have been serving for many years and have become friends who know our likes and dislikes. The menu specials change monthly and are particularly good value at lunchtime. The kitchen will customise dishes and often offer items not on the menu. Just ask and the staff try their best to oblige
5
Made a trip down here before catching Skyfall. I was not disappointed but thoroughly impressed.Restaurant was fully booked and there were only seats at the sushi bar. I was disappointed initially but it allowed my partner and I to witness the artisan skill of the chef who prepared the intricate sashimi and sushi for us and the other patrons.I got the November set course, and it delivered on presentation, taste and proportion. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Service was excellent and I would come back for more

Kuriya is a good choice for buisiness meetings - the lunch sets are extensive, with grilled foods, sushi, sashimi, tempura, paper steamboats -enough to cater to a wide variety of tastes for a business group- and all the sets are elegantly presented. The sets all come with a lively fresh salad.Service is excellent, and the service staff will try their best to accommodate modifications to the sets for the regulars.Reservations are encouraged, to ensure a table
4
Staff are all extremely cheerful and polite. Lovely smiles on faces are a standard. A chorus of greeting welcomes you. Service is great- from taking time to explain the daily fresh catch to prompt top ups of tea and plates cleared. Food is deliciously fresh. Staff are not pushy and will recommend appropriate dishes based on your preferences. Their grilled fish and set lunches are marvelous. Do ask for less salt on the grilled fish as it sometimes is too salty. The mini pot shabu is simple with the natural fresh flavors bursting through. The sashimi feels like the chef just caught the fish...it's that fresh. Prices are slightly steep. But I guess you pay for the quality.

Price is fair, food is fresh. Place is nice, juz tht choice is quite limited.

Try the kaiseki sets; wife enjoyed the daintiness (more than I did)

private dinning with wide choice in menu

Love this place for freshness and space

The food and service is nice. But quite pricey

Love the ambience, but the service is not as good as before, esp. during the fugu buffet.

nice.. but very costly.. definitely overpriced...

Worth, just, the money.

Elegant Japanese dining in this branch ...

A restaurant that is always busy. It is currently under renovation ( I am not sure whether has it started business again) I have to queue around 30 mins just to pay my bills after my meal, which turns out to be quite tedious. But I like the sashimi the best (especially hamachi sashimi and uni sashimi

chunky fresh fish sashimi/sushi + nice prickly wasabi!

It's been a while but if it is the same as before, the setting is great and they have private rooms which is fantastic for groups. The taste is not to bad and price is slightly on the upmarket but still reasonable.

Standard drop. We have our company lunches there quite often..

ichiban! fresh ingredients..... but no specialties thus can be boring...

the uni here is really fresh

Love it!

One of the better "mid-range" japanese resturants. Prefer the one at Raffles Place though
5
Always a treat to visit ‚Äì elegant, pretty private and service that is attentive yet unobtrusive. Servers always gives good recommendations and menu rotations lends something new to try on every visit. Sukiyaki is almost faultless here and so are the many many many side dishes that constitute a main meal, without any mains. And when in doubt, go for the premium sashimi/sushi ‚Äì worth every penny. Still not sure what to have, pick the Kaiseki and your tastebuds would thank you for it (not to mention, your stomach will be duly satisfied)
