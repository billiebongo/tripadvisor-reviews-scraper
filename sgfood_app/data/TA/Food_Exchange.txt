Service A1, Food B2
We went for a New Year Celebrations... got a good mix of food... Food is good but no “WOW” factor... Service is very very good. The manager said thia to me “Nothing is impossible if customers request”. I am impressed.

Food Exchange in Novotel Singapore on Stevens is now one of my favorite dining places. It is a charming restaurant away from the city with good food and service. It's a winning combination.They have European and Asian dishes, seafood, and mouth-watering dessert that a weight-watcher like me cannot resist. The design of the place is clever and effective, with ample space for visitors to manoeuvre and a good outdoor view.The staff members are ever attentive and helpful. I would like to thank Abel, Deep, Lennard, Tamil, Jude, Beulah and others for making each visit a perfect dining experience. They are the pros

I loved the modern design of the restaurant with its high ceilings and natural light. Service was attentive and friendly. Food was above average, with a good variety. There were little surprises, like pan-fried foie gras (which I haven't seen before) and a DIY roasted marshmallow area which was a hit with my friend's daughter. Overall, my colleagues and I had a great lunch

Likes : The japanese selection of sushi, sashimi, chilled prawns, crab legs, etc. all tasted fresh and nice. Good service and attentive staff.Dislikes : The laksa was terrible without prawns or tao pok; the satay only came in mutton which if given one choice, perhaps chicken will be more suitable

+ The restaurant caters to whole lot asian cuisine with a small counter of Indian options.+ The staff is always welcoming with a smile. They cater to your needs.- The food quality needs to improve a bit. Most dishes are oily or extreme dried up. Indian counter needs an upgrade. Desserts were limited to cakes and fruits were not a big option.- Need to have Halal food/ Kitchen as Singapore has lots of muslims residents and arab muslim travellers

We had dinner here and the food was average.Its overpriced for average food.Food was topped up even though its a buffett so if you have dinner at 8pm you miss out on all the good things which had not been replenished. Service was poor, cannot get the attention of the waiters/waitresses

@TheKuoKnowsThis is not just another place in Singapore to eat as much as you like. Although you can if you want.Instead, it is a place to sample local cuisine with some French pizzazz. You would expect nothing less from Novotel.The “local” food section is a great place to start. I thought the rendang was as good as you would get anywhere.There is seafood aplenty, especially if you are a lover of prawns. But try not to over-indulge. There is more fish in the sea than just crustaceans.I thought the food stations were a standout. The “chef behind the counter” is fast becoming de rigueur at upmarket buffets........But the key is the not just the cooking but the rapport between diner and chef. Food Exchange has got the balance right.Food Exchange is a great addition to Singapore’s international buffet scene. It is pushing the boundries. The others will have to follow or risk getting left behind
