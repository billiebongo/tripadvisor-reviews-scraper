Enjoyed the different sets. Repeat customer. Shin always serves quality food and good variety. Very good.
4
Restaurant offers a good selection of kushiyaki skewers, fresh sashimi and other Japanese fare. Good service and atmosphere makes this a nice dining locale.
4
Used my chope vouchers to offset our 2 set lunch which was very worth it. Especially like the bacon wrapped tomato
5
Have been to Shin Kushiya numerours times till I lost count, in fact patronizing them since they open the outlet in Vivo City.
Great food, friendly service Crews and good ambience for family or friends gathering.
5
This is the 2nd time visit after 1 year. Without failing, the food are still as good and price are reasonable. Give it a try if you enjoy Japanese cuisine.
5
The restaurant was having a one for one promotion for all its lunch sets. It was worth it.. the sashimi was fresh and side dishes were wonderful. Comes with complimentary drink or dessert. The tofu cheesecake was wonderful. One for one still valid on Mondays.
5
their food is very value for money! delicious, yet not too expensive! must try their buta platter! spacious restaurant, which is very important, especially for family with kids or infants.
4
Service was good considering they were quite busy during lunch hour. Staff were attentive and service was pretty fast too.
Food quality was up to mark with the pricing.
4
Seats were reserved accordingly. Food are served promptly. Except for teriyaki squid which was a bit cold. Overall an enjoyable dining experience
3
The restaurant has an extensive menu, but the tast was pretty bland. The price was reasonable, service not attentive
5
We had a baby and the service crew were attentive to bring child cutlery to us. Tried their dons and salmon maki.. all delicious. Good value for money.
5
Ordered the Katsu don, udon and a skewered platter for 2 pax at $52. Very well seasoned, tasty and value for money. Service staff were friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back for more!
4
Food and ambience was good. Very quiet area to dine in if it's past the peak lunch hours.... but one thing I'd like to stress - one young waiter actually gave me a receipt that's almost no ink imprinted on it. Shouldn't he reprint another receipt for me instead of giving me that almost-blank receipt? That's totally unacceptable
5
Great Japanese skewers. Service staff seemed a bit inattentive in the big spanse of space. More attentive and experienced staff served our bill at the end.
4
Food served is of good quality and taste. However, service is average as service crew who serve food looks like part timer who is shy and does not name the dish. The utensils served together also slipped down the food and is stained with the sauce
3
The food is of acceptable quality here, good value for the prices. Of special note is their outstanding service, from the bar tender to the service team are very friendly and helpful. Well done
5
Yakitori was good. Like the saba shio. They had an anniversary promo with 1 for 1 beer and 1 for 1 yoghurt drinks which was a very good deal.
5
The restuarant is packed and you need make a reservation. The staffs are ever friendly and always at your service. The food came in skewers and I love the beef . You can have a choice of beef, chicken or pork. I find the pork had a certain smell. Yhe also have thesr quail eggs, mini tomatoes on skewers too. The garlic rice is recommended.
4
A decent Japanese restaurant at VivoCity. There are small dishes, including skewers and sashimi, for the set dinner, which is quite tasty
2
Got news from CHOPE regarding the restuarant's special 11th anniversary kushiyaki don set and made booking to try it. Staff informed that they do not serve such set and did not offer any alternatives. It was disappointing that no explanations were given nor any alternatives offered. Food tasted so-so and portion were small. Ambience was good though.
4
Very spacious restaurant and service is very good. The staffs has reserved a table which has good view overseeing Sentosa. Would come back again.
4
Decided to try the National Day promotion - good deal. Food was freshly prepared and service was fast. The family had a good time.
5
Food was tasty and price was reasonable for a food like this.
Had visited this restaurant 7 years ago. They had maintained the same food taste which was really yummy. Standard did not drop.
5
Arranged for weekend lunch at Shin. Lunch sets are value for money and there was a 1-for-1 drinks promo. Only thing is their largest table setting only for 6 and unfortunately there were a lot of screaming kids.
3
When I saw the menu on Shin Kushiya's website, I was excited, great variety, reasonable prices. One of the things I dislike most dining outside is the difference in presentation of dishes pictured on the menu and the actual thing. Totally different and misleading. Why bother putting a pic when the dish comes out looking so different? The other annoying thing is the inconsistency of the same dish. We ordered these salmon skewers and they were really good. My friend re-ordered and it came out tasting quite different the second time round. I would give the food rating a good, unfortunately, the rating goes from average to Very Good and I certainly don't think it's Very Good. I would visit again though for the sheer variety they offer
4
Visited restaurant over lunch. There is a wide selection of lunch set options all reasonably priced. I ordered the Mixed Kushiya set, love the nicely grilled skewers and appetizer. Will definitely go back.
4
Set in Vivocity, the restaurant was a lot bigger than I thought. The sashimi was fresh and the truffle pasta was great! Only complaint would be the dessert, the mochi was not at all satisfying.
3
Service needs improvement, took almost 10mins for us to finally catch the attention of 1 the 3 staffs that were "loitering" near the kitchen and there were like only 4 occupied tables inclusive of ours. The buta platter were great compared to the gyu and vegetable platter which were a tad overdone and dry. Trio of sashimi fav was fresh and good. Cali maki, soft shell crab maki, tori karaage and tako fry was pretty normal, nothing special as there wasn't any special marinates or sauces that came with it
3
Good place for business meetings, getogether or even a date! Loved the yakitori and garlic fried rice here.
2
Service was lacking and I had to have the waiter to revise my bill twice! Staff was not well trained and a couple of times could not understand my order and request.
4
Both food and service was good. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout my whole dining experience.
5
This is my second visit with my family. Quantity is just nice. Nice dessert too. however, more choices of ramen or udon would be better
5
Food is great and value for money, quick service too. One of my favourite Japanese restaurant for sure.
3
Casual Japanese restaurant with decent food. Companions enjoyed their grilled skewers. Room for improvement on the service front.
5
The yakitoris are a must try! Instead of ordering the set menu, you can choose your own favourite yakitoris and form your own set :)
4
Great for gathering and family outings. Family friendly restaurant. Good taste good and price is reasonable. Will definitely visit again.
4
Dinner with my sister and her family from overseas. My baby nephew also enjoy his dining experience. First time here but definitely will be back. Food is better than expected.
5
Had dinner here abd i really enjoyed the gyu platter and buta platter. The garlic fried rice is a musttry!
4
The location is in the bustling Vivo City shopping mall, although they do a very good job of partitioning you away from that with a view out of the window & away from the mall.The service is very well intentioned, although like most of the service in Singapore they lack knowledge & training.The food was generally very good & the nigiri portions surprisingly large.The very fatty seared tuna is excellent & their selection of sake is good & well priced
3
Popped by for lunch on the recommendation of my cousin. It is quite a large restaurant inside, thouh you would not guess it from the entrance. They have large booth tables which can seat groups from 3 upwards. The relatively elderly staff members, especially the lady, were friendly and kept coming round to top off our tea.They have lots of lunch options, including several sets. My cousin went for the beef and vegetable kushiyaki set while I had the mixed kushiyaki. The items are grilled upon ordering so it will take around 10 minutes for the meal to be served. We liked the cherry tomatoes that were wrapped respectively in beef and pork slices. Each set comes eith a bowl of rice as well as soup. The portions were generous, as well
5
As usual. Skewers were delish. Service was swift. Ambience was nice for lunch with guests. Will be back for more.
2
Lousy service, salty food, not value for money...have to wait for 1 hour before they serve you a simple bowl of garlic rice. All the grilled items are very salty. The beef noodles is a flop. Will not visit again.
4
Went during lunchtime and enjoyed the lunch sets, which are good value and delicious. The skewers are grilled to perfection. Do try the grilled mushrooms stuffed with minced chicken!
5
Great food.
Try the pumpkin with chicken salad.its too good. Very reasonable price and fresh great food.
Salmon teriyaki is yum. Fresh fish.
Sashimi was fresh too.
3
Food was okay. Service can be improved. We have to ask for tea refills.
Orders was taken wrongly but corrected half way after we made inquiry.
Not impressed.
4
Food is really tasty especially the garlic fried rice and pork skewers. But the service is really lacking. It might be the lack of staff thus everyone was busy. It was hard to grab their attention. The restaurant is a kid-friendly restaurant so families with kids can visit there
4
Shin Kushiya, located at the Harbour front walk Vivo City, the restaurant is dimly lit with decor mostly consists of dark brown - wooden colour shades. A drawback is the hard-surface interior, which amplifies noise. Most tables are arranged without privacy, unless you get a booth table, you usually end up listening to conversation next table. The restaurant pride themselves for there signature Kushiyaki skewers grilled over specially imported charcoal called Bincho (White Charcoal) to provide a crisp smokiness while sealing the natural flavours within. The more popular items here include the various Kushiyaki Japanese skewers, the Zensai appetizers, Yakimono grilled meats and seafood, and fresh Sashimi. For dessert, do try the Japanese green tea ice-cream, with its unique texture that is slightly gel-like, yet melts easily in your mouth. Service is rather efficient, Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will definitely come back. Very soooon
1
We were a party of 8 coming for lunch. The menu looks good, but the food is actually average. But the worst was the service. It took us several requests to finally have a waiter coming and take our order, and another 45 minutes to be served... little by little. One guest served, then another one served 5 minutes later, and so on. One of us had to wait more than an hour to finally be first served.... his dessert ! The salmon teriyaki came 10 minutes after.When I wanted to complain to the manager, she just told me she had no time to speak to me and ran to another table.If they are that understaffed and unable to serve the customers within a reasonable time, they shall stop admission beyond a certain level
3
I went there with my colleagues yesterday. The biggest disappointment that i had was that they stopped serving draft beer. Food varieties and options are very good. The service is slow and the waiting time is long.. Hopefully they can improve on that.. They can improve on the beer options.. It was worth the price for the food...If they serve draft beer, i would love to visit again or a strict No No to this restaurant. My friends and colleagues have the same feeling as well
5
I've been going to Shin Kushiya for years, and the service is always good and the food remains tasty as ever. The little skewered delicacies such as mushrooms stuffed with chicken, grilled veggies, pork, beef or fish are superb! The view of Sentosa Universal Studios is a plus and the atmosphere is cozy and unpretentious. Parking is a breeze, because is inside Vivo City, a mall
5
first time in this restaurant but surprise surprise really great food for a small amount. you get all typical japanese food - sushi, bbq, soup etc
name it as you want its available
also they're really fast ... staff is great
everytime again
4
Was there for a birthday dinner. The food was good and service was quite fast. The staff were also very polite. Must try their sashimi and sushi
4
I had a Don set with my girlfriend here. There was a 50% off second lunch set promotion happening now, making it a really great deal. Even without it, the salmon Don is one of the cheaper ones you can have in town.
3
The restaurant offers a wide range of Japanese barbeque. However, the taste of the food is on an average only.
2
Expensive prices for frozen sashimi and chicken.
Ambience is great and service crew is one of the friendliest.
Won't come back again.
4
We called in here for lunch and wow delicious food. We have a combo meal of sushi and grill meat/seafood and also ordered extra sushi and grilled prawns and it was all delicious. As we have experienced previously the service was a little slow and we had to chase up one of our drinks and sushi. But about halfway through our meal another lady started attending us and she was brilliant, very attentive and friendly. Highly recommend the food
5
In Singapore, you'll often find good Japanese food at astronomical prices, or affordable ones that taste quite bad. I enjoy Shin Kushiya because it manages to find a good balance in between. The food is great (not the best), but very affordable. I'll definitely go agai
4
Good service. Came with complimentary appetiser salad. Grilled food are good. Just follow the top 5 customers favourite dish and you wont go wrong. Have choice of curry salt or plum salt to go with the skewer food (the plum salt is better as it does not overpower the taste of food).
4
This place has great quality produce. They specialise in Yakitori sticks, and have a very extensive menu. They also have very goods Sushi/Sashimi, and a limited but equally good selection of hot food items. Like most good Japanese restaurants around the world, this one isn't cheap, especially when you add a bottle of Sake to the bill, but for an occasional treat, or informal special occasion, I highly recommend it
4
I had my team lunch here to celebrate a successful conference. Due to tight budget and huge group, I had made a survey of a few restaurants and Shin Kushiya is the only one that follow up with me after a few days and offer alternative to their sister restaurant. We were serve with fresh Sashimi and great yakitori. Great Job!!
3
The presentation of the food was was artistically done and the freshness of the sushi superb. Reasonably priced and varied saki selection. The service was attentive and not over barring.
A winner in my book and would recommend this good dinning experience.
3
Five of us ate a business lunch. The food was pretty good and i enjoyed my yakotiri set lunch and the sushi sashimi was also very good apparently. Nothing remarkable about the food but tasty, quick and good value.
4
Last week, my colleagues and I were looking for a place to dine, and we decided on this restaurant at Vivo City. I had all along thought itâ€™s a solely Kushiyaki restaurant that serves grilled items. I was surprised at their menu, which was extensive and includes food such as sushi and sashimi. Just for the Yakitori section, the menu had close to 50 items, divided into Pork, beef, chickens and vegetable sections.We ordered from across the menu and the standouts were:- Cold Somen. $14.20. Chilled thin noodles with dipping sauce. There are different toppings such as seaweed, sesame, shiso leaf that you can put into the dipping sauce to enjoy different taste for your somen. Came with prawns, shitake mushroom and a soft boiled egg. Nice!- Tori Karrage: $8.60. Deep fried chicken. Chicken pieces are big and generous.- Pumpkin Croquette:$8.60. Crispy pumpkin croquettes. Loved this. It was unique and taste good. A goma (sesame sauce) was served with it. Complemented the croquette.- Lobster Maki: $16.20. Rock lobster topped sushi roll. This is also good. The lobster is chopped up with mayonnaise and topped on the maki. Order it. - Aburi Salmon Maki: $15. Salmon was wrapped around the maki and flame broiled. Try it!Yakitori -- Tsukune: $2.40. Grilled chicken meatballs. The balls were about ping pong sized with a good soy dressing. - Negima: $2.40. Chicken and leek with soy sauce. This was not bad. - Nikuzume Shitake: $2.80. Mushroom stuffed with minced chicken. I like mushrooms, so I enjoyed this. - Tori Sasami Mentai: $2.80. Grilled pieces of chicken breast with spicy codfish roe over it. I like this. - Gyu Enoki Maki: $4. Golden mushrooms wrapped with sliced beef. Beef is good. - Miso Yaki Onigiri: Grilled Japanese rice ball with miso. I like this, as the rice ball has some burnt parts that give it a nice flavour.- Mentai Yaki Onigiri: Grilled rice ball with spicy codfish roe. A different flavour from the earlier riceball. Also good.Dessert: - Tea Jelly with milk: The tea jelly has a mild tea flavour. Would have preferred the jelly to have a stronger flavour. It came with a side of milk that you can pour over the jelly. - Sesame dessert cake with sesame ice cream: This was good. We finished this in a blink of an eye. The dessert cake is like deconstructed pudding and taste good. They have interesting drinks menu that include mocktails made with Calpis (a refreshing drink) and Yakult. They have a good variety of food here that will cater to different taste buds. Go try it
4
Had dinner with my cousin. Well designed and layout of this restaurant is pleasant at a convenient location in Vivo City. Generally, food are well prepared with simple but nice presentation. The prices are reasonable. To finish off our meal, we had dessert...cheese tofu which was so smooth but a little too sweet for me. We also had black sesame ice cream which was superb. I will come back for more whenever I am in Singapore again
4
Well-managed Japanese restaurant with a nice location in VivoCity. The Menu is fairly extensive, with many charcoal-grilled items. A good place to satisfy one's craving for Sashimi and other Japanese favourites. While the food is not quite at gourmet level, the prices are fair and reasonable. We like the restaurant's design which offers patrons some privacy and comfort even when the place is packed
3
As aficionados of Ton Katsu Don, my husband and I had lunch at Shin Kushiya. The food was well presented and served hot. The quality of the meat was good but the peas were an interesting twist to this traditional dish. We particularly enjoyed the Yakult based juices. A good view of Sentosa from the window seat and prompt service. We will come again.It is very strange that they charge separately on your bill for the provision of a wet napkin
3
Service is not the best during busy periods and it appears the level of cooking is a bit rushed tooIf they spent more time on the cooking and emphasis on the service - this place has huge potentialThe options on the menu were good enough to grab our attention and some of the dishes we ordered were actually extremely goodIt's the consistency of what came out that let them down.....also bringing out the starter as the last dish is simply plain daftSort yourselves out please!!Same theme again - improve the service and you will generate more repeat custo
2
Went to eat with my family. Ordered the salmon ikura don "set". Salmon was fresh the rice was very plain with their efforts to add more flavour by putting seaweed under the sashimi. My dad ordered the kushiyaki favourite set everything was tasty. But after eating felt very thirsty must be ajinomoto..Mum ordered ladies set bro and sis ordered tempura udon and tosei saba all were mediocre. Went back the 2nd time had chasu udon soup was salty and no "savoury" flavour was quite disappointed. Chasu had no taste.
4
We visited the JEM outlet.Service was goodStaff were friendlyWe ordered1)Beef Udon2)Mixed Kushiyaki Set3)Seafood Kushiyaki Set4)Black Angus Ribeye5)Gyu Enoki Maki6)ShitakeTotal bill $90 so price is above average but son loved the Inaniwa Udon which is flat and thinner compared with an ordinary typeMUST try!Worth a visi
3
This is my first time trying this at Vivo City after recommendations from several friends. I feel that the decorations were pretty good and this place is very cosy. Helps that the meats were nicely grilled and the quality was very worth for rice price. Wil be visiting again soon-!
4
Their menu is interesting and the variety is good. I tried the beef platter. It's nice, juicy and tender. The udon is average and a bit overpriced.
4
Was at Vivo City recently with a bunch of friends and we decided to have dinner here because we had never tried the food before and it was one of a very small decent-looking restaurants without a major queue. The restaurant prides itself on its signature charcoal-grilled dishes focusing on combinations of meat or fish, occasionally interspersed with vegetables. There are loads to choose from, most costing at least $4, so the bill adds up quickly if you're a big eater. But there are also 5 or 6 combos that are useful for those who can't quite decide what to have. I settled for a seafood combo - the three types of grilled fish was lovely, especially one with grated garlic (I think) on top but the grilled prawn less so. My companions had a bento set that came with a yufu ice cream dessert with a rather overly-sweet/piquant passion fruit sauce that sort of overwhelmed the palate.Decor-wise, it was relatively spacious and the slightly dim lighting made the ambience enjoyable for a meal-time chat. Service could be improved, however, with a strange practice of waiting staff only serving and clearing meals while orders had to be referred to a specific member of the staff. Otherwise, it was quite an enjoyable evening but watch the bill closely if you're cost-conscious
3
The food is very standard and consistent. It is not mouth wateringly delicious - something that you could stand in a queue for an hour for and at the same time it is also not something that would turn you off. You would probably come back if you did not hear of something exceptionally good or a new kid on the block. Price wise very affordable. Staff is very nice
2
I am reviewing the branch at JEM. Were having dinner with a friend at this restaurant, only two of us but the waitress lead us to a table for 6, anyway we appreciated that very much. Service was good but not the food. One thing I am very particular about eating Japanese food is the rice, in this restaurant, I was so disappointed by the rice they provided. It was not nice, taste like low quality rice and not much like Japanese rice at all. Another thing that disappointed me was the squid with Kimchi. taste was not nice at all, squid over cooked, with the kimchi wrapping inside the squid, and the taste of kimchi was not outstanding at all, it was so bland, and the matching with the squid was not delicious at all.We also ordered the Skewered set, most of the meat were overcooked and very dry. Only thing I like is the YUZU tea, that was nice especially after all the oily food. Price wise, was not cheap, we paid $70 plus for two glass of drinks, a skewered set, a squid wrapped with kimchi, plus the taxes. I don't mind paying more for good food but this meal really did not worth the money I paid
1
The restaurant has a standard in it. But the thing is that the food isn't fresh. I actually found out that the restaurant isn't clean after all. I actually saw a rat ran over into the kitchen. Their food especially their tori katsu. U can actually smell the chicken bloody and kinda spoiling soon. The chawanmushi chicken is also the same. I dun really want recommend my friend or family there. I ate once with my family too and they dun really find the food fresh too.. because I'm working as a chef in other Japanese restaurant near keppel that's why I know how to different the food is it fresh or not.
4
Typical japenese restaurant. The good thing about this one is that it also offers a lot for non sushi and sashimi lovers. As we are a family of 6 with one non believer this was perfect. Great rolls, sashimi and meat variaties.Price is a bit high but up to Singapore standards.....
4
Tried out SK on a Sat night at Vivocity. Although there was a queue, our group of 5A1C managed to get a table within half an hour. The Soba is pretty good and so are the the Kushiyaki (charcoal-grilled skewers) which come in many choices : beef, pork, fish and seafood etc. The restaurant seemed to be a little shorthanded (which is common for most eateries in spore nowadays) but service is still rather prompt and good. We were able to get a good view of the fireworks from RWS Sentosa while we dined there that evening which is a bonus. SK has recently opened a new branch at JEM
4
I've been here multiple times and keep coming back. I tend to be a steak person because I dislike it when jap food quality varies too much. I come back to Shin because except for 1 occasion at the far east Sq outlet, food has always been impeccable. My recommendations:The Sashimi platters all rock. Tuna Belly especially. What makes it different is the size of the cuts and the freshness of the fish. none of that stringy or stale experiences. Yes there might not be many cuts in total, but if u take the overall size and wt of the cuts... totally a worthy mouthful.The Yakitori are good too. I tend to stick with the solid meats like the pork neck and the miso beef.The garlic fried rice is a must. Not the bland tasting kind. Especially great if you prefer rich taste or slightly more salty carb types. It does cost a little and if you are used to the more commercialized jap f&b outlets you might find it steep but quality wise its comparable to many of the top-cost/grade jap restaurants in sg but at a slightly cheaper price. The service can be a little average at times depending on how busy they are. Thing I have noticed is that they might not meet your every expectation but I tend to notice that they try
5
Went to the outlet @My Village Serangoon Gardens. They have a lunch 1-1 promotion except for public holiday. I have the Kushiya favourite bento and my partner the Healthier choice bento. Portion is generous and sashimi is fresh. Loved the teriyaki sticks. We added the Uni sushi and foe gras. Overall, we spent $77.80. Would have been better if the green tea is free. They charge $1.6 for the green tea although this is refillable. Will certainly revisit
2
Bring my little niece there on a Sunday lunch. I would say the menu is expensive. Food quality is very average (to maybe slightly below average). They do have nice cheap kids menu but I guess that's a draw for parents. Services was sub standard and slow. Probably won't go back again
4
Had dinner at this place on Saturday night. It was very crowded but my food came within 10 minutes. Food quality was excellent - chawan mushi, fried octupus, grills were all excellent
Staff was courteous, food came quickly.. Absolute loved the food
4
Really liked the ambience, being able to see RWS on Sentosa from the restaurant. Food is great, service is good, and it's no wonder it's one of my fave Japanese casual dining places.
5
I think every "shin" is a good food place to eat, of course this is not shin-ji by raffles quality food, but you get nice food, no matter how bad your day is
3
My wife and I hoped for better, reading a glowing review on another site, and went to the Pekin St branch. Utterly unexceptional was the best way to put it...not awful, and not pricey, but nothing memorable or outstanding, with some dishes simply average.
5
Always love the food here, nice staff. Skewers are great, so is the sashimi ..... Only disappointment was a Yaki-onigiri which was small and a little dry but I am really nitpicking because we eat here a lot and everything else is fab! They have kids meals too which are nicely done though too small for my 10 yr old son. Ok for my 12 yr old daughter though. I mention their ages (partly to indicate potential appetite) but because in some SG restaurants the cut off age for kids menus is 6 yrs old! Tables are quite close together but any claustrophobic feeling is mitigated by a clever veil drape in the middle of the restaurant space. Booths are fine but my fave spot is by the window - reservation deffo required for that
3
I had dinner tonight with my husband and my friend. The grills- meatballs and chicken were nice. I had chicken and vegetables udon. However, the portion of the Udon seemed to be a bit too small for me. It is now 3 hours past my dinner time, and I am hungry again
4
Very wide selection of Japanese favourites, from sushi and sashimi to kushi, rice bowls, agemono, soba, udon etc. Sapporo beer available in pitchers and other by bottle. Our second family visit the other night and I was especially impressed by the quality of the sashimi. Staff are friendly and service generally efficient. I just wish they would learn to say'irashaimase' correctly
2
There are several outlets with this chain including Suntec city, serangoon gardens, and west coast. The 3 of us were there in the Suntec branch for lunch and we ordered the executive sushi set, the skewer set and teriyaki chicken set. The challenge was that the sushi looked a bit stale, the skewered meats were oozing with oil and the teriyaki chicken tasted like cafeteria food. It was competitively priced: the all-in bill was $31 per person. But we were happy to pay more for better quality food. We won't be back
4
My wife and I ate here for lunch as I was craving some Japanese food.The food was good and they had quite a selection for set lunch menus. I ordered the meat Kushiyaki set and was pleased. My wife ordered the Tempura and soba set which was good. The tempura was crispy as it should be and not soggy or dripping with oil. Although we did not eat sushi or sashimi, I did walk up to the bar to inspect the fish. The fish looked very fresh and I will certainly try some on our next visitThe meat was juicy and had that nice marbling flavour that you would expect from Japanese beef. I would only imagine the premium beef on the dinner menu would be even better.We definitely will come back and try the dinner menu.The service was good and punctual even though the lady serving us was a trainee. My wife ordered the non set menu but they brought the entire set anyway. The bill was correct however when we received it so there was no fuss over that.I was very please with the miso soup. It was not instant or watered down at all and the rice was just like you would get in Japan, sticky and hot
5
Very good Japanese restaurant in Vivocity. We received attentive and courteous service throughout. Not too pricey given the excellence of the food and the superior location. Extensive menu. None of the cooked dishes disappointed. And we were really pleased with the quality of the Sashimi Platter, esp. the Toro, Salmon Belly, and Oysters
3
Nice set meal but quite costly... Limited choice from menu.
4
Great grills.
5
Had some good experiences in the Vivo and Suntec outlets over the past few months.. heard there's one at Far East Square as well. Will check it out if I happen to be nearby, though its more office crowd located.
2
poor service, limited range
4
Great value for money, variety
3
I ate at Shin Kushiya at suntec. I had this salmon soup rice which wasabi really enhance the whole soup taste perfectly. Salmon belly was also awesome. then again, it was in very small protion.
1
Went to the one at Pekin Street. Awful! The salmon was mushy and dark. The same lunch sets were inconsistent. Will not go back.
4
Expensive but creative menu
4
Food is good, and the ambiance is comfortable.
4
Great grill selection; my vegan husband didn't feel marginalized.
