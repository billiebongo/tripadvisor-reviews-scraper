The higher end restaurant of the imperial treasure group, the food here rarely disappoints. The star is probably the xiao long bao, which my friends say is better than that of a renowned Taiwanese chain. And I can see why. The pastry skin is thinner, and the filling less salty. Other dishes and dim sim are good too, thanks in no small part to the quality of the stock they use. Prefect for dressing up for Sunday dim sum

One of my favourite Shanghai restaurants where the service is good and the food is lovely. Lots of authentic Shanghai dishes and a good selection of dim sum if you're there at lunc
4
Great place for a nice meal. The service was good and the food even better. The only problem I had was that the servers did not speak or understand English which made ordering a little bit of a challenge.The dim sun was delicate and some of the best I've had. The lamien noodles had little flavour and the broth was bland. Not that great and could really be improved
5
We tried a few dishes including duck with tea leaves, mabo tofu, shiao long bao, and prawns with salted egg yolk. It was all great tasting and the service was prompt and efficient. I like that this restaurant offers a variety of dishes that are not found easily in other Chinese restaurants. The location is convenient and it is always a good idea to call and reserve because it gets very busy

delicious food, nice decor, value is average - not "over the top expensive" but not cheap either. Quantity is ok as well. The only caveat is to know that not everything on the menu is shanghainese food - more of a mix. The only other small thing is the staff. Could the staff please smile more and be less snobby. Especially the girl who is at the front desk - taking reservations / tables. Dishes come out too fast - the chef needs to slow down and allow customers to eat one dish at a time. This isnt a race to see who finishes their meal first. Otherwise its a good restaurant - unfortunately located in a noisy shopping mall. Would recommend the pot stickers and shanghai noodles - two classic dishe
3
The restaurant had probably tried to style itself as high-end or fine dining. However, the food was nothing to rave about despite the higher price point. Won't miss much to skip this place
4
I just tried their Yam single yolk mooncake. Wow very very yammy! For so many years, I manage to find a yam mooncake which is able to meet my standards.The yam paste is so fine and not sweet and the pastry skin is not oily and is freshly made today. Their Shanghai cuisines are good and the service standards there is high too. Good job chef and try to maintain the service standards forever
4
Nice ambience.The atmosphere is good for business, But the service below expectation. Steam rice with blue Lobster litter bit salty...Anyway the food and vegetable is fresh
4
The ambience is very nice especially you sit at the special booth.Food is good and authentic.Service is good too
5
Always satisfied with the food quality here especially the crispy eel Shanghai Xiao Long Bao and some entrees. The atmosphere is great and clean.
5
We started lunch with dimsum and ordered different entrees and honey peas with truffle was my favorite. The shrimps were succulent and black truffle dominated the dish to create this wonderful dish. Fried goose was so tasty too. Overall everything we ordered was delicious not to mention service was fantastic
4
We were 5. Enjoyed the good food. The appetisers, Crispy eel, Glass noodles with spicy sesame sauce and shredded chicken, cold tofu with century egg was all great. Their Honey Smoked duck, prawns with honey beans with truffles, Siew Long Pau, Jin Bai with Ham and fried rice were delicious. Plus drinks, tax and service it ended high in the 5 hundred dollars! Is it worth it? For entertainment and if one can afford it
4
Dine here on a Saturday afternoon while visiting my family. The place was clean and dim sum was excellent. We asked for the special chilli which makes everything more delicious!Ordered the usual dim sum dishes and it did not disappoint.
3
We like to come to this restaurant since it opened because the quality of food is high and the taste authentic.But we were disappointed on our last visit. May be because it was on Mother's Day and they were busy and the chefs were tired.When we arrived at the booking time, the table was not ready. Worse, they gave a table away to a group that came later.The smoke tea duck was dry. The Hunan ham sandwich was also dry.The dishes were not garnished nicely. Seems like they were rushed. Very little service through out the dinner. Captain did not come around and check on us. I don't mind paying more but, compared to other restaurants, the food and service is definitely not worthy of the Star they received last year.Very disappointed. Hope they can improve
5
Imperial Treasure has been one of the top favourite Chinese restaurant for me! I personally love the fish porridge and the dim sum
5
Superb, authentic Chinese dining. Try the pork with brown sauce or the Ma Po Tofu especially! Will be going back for sure
4
Dim sum treat with three varieties, the soupy one with pork, prawn, spinach; then the stir fried kalang with garlic & finally stir fried noodles with chicken. Sprinkle chilli oil and you have a rocket meal. Must try cost sgd 80 for 2. Not bad eh!! great service
5
Good Shanghai restaurant! Nice fish meat vegi. Good services. Nice decor. Nice companion. Nice wine.
5
One of our favourite places to have wanton soup, smoked duck and dim sum. A bit pricey but quality always there.Best to book a table in advance
4
Great Shanghai Cuisine food in singapore. The Yanduxian soup is delicious and quiet tradition. Deco is nice as well. Siting in the Ngee Ann city is fine location to have a good lunch or dinner.
4
High quality, tasty food with high quality decor.
Fast service.
They give a complimentary glass of wine for reviews so yea :p
This is just my opinion :)
5
Great food and great service!! Thx for May and Franko!! Great recommendations and we enjoyed very much!
5
Excellent friendly & services. Miss May (AM) is able to recommend the types of food just right for the 2 of us.Ambience is nice and cozy; food here is excellent too.Highly recommended place for all occasions
4
This place serves northern china food.Tasty and nice.Ambience is beautiful.Service is good.Recommended that you should come
4
The overall atmosphere is great, the staff were very friendly and the food was nice ! But it is pricey
5
This is one of our favorite restaurants. Top ratings for ambience and food. Among the best in Singapore. Tea today is however too weak.
4
We love the scallions noodles which are well seasoned without being too salty. The xiao long baos are also better quality than the ones we tried in din tang fung
5
Aesthetically pleasing plating; good food and service. Food was served promptly; polite service and will be back again
4
Always an enjoyable visit. The service and choice of dishes are impeccable. Great for family meals. See photo for recommended dishes.
5
A family lunch at this shanghai cuisine. Menu is of good variety and authentic, as my MIL is shanghai native. Very delicately presently as well. Would recommend
4
Located in the heart of Singapore, at Orchard Takashimaya. A unique place for lunch with wooden interior decor. The drunken chicken & Xiao Long Bao must try!
4
The food was great and the service was excellent. The dim sums were also great; especially the xiao long bao which was filled with lots of soup. The Lou Hei had lots of salmon and tasted great
4
Came here for my family's annual CNY dinner. Yusheng was good - fish was fresh only the sauce slightly on the sweeter side. Xiao long bao was juicy and delicious. Would come back again for a special occasion.
5
Highly recommend for someone who looks for authentic shanghainese food. Also good ambience. Convenient location. Better make a booking beforehand as this place can be quite popular on weekends.
5
Good foods and excellent services! Drunken chicken and xiao long bao are MUST Try! Wonderful dining experience
4
Good ambience.Timely service.Dishes worth ordering:Smoked duck with tea leavesAnd the bun that came with it was served soft and warm.Wanted to try the dim sum but it wasn't available due to cny.but it looked yummy.
5
Best Xiow long Bao in town ! Delicious dim sum and excellent service !'Must try ' for travelers who are kin to have Shanghainese dim sum - Xiow long bao ,dumplings, onion pancake ....
5
We had our annual gathering and as usual the food and service did not disappoint. We specifically ordered the shun-de yu-sheng and had it was fantastic. Simple ingredients but well executed. The other dishes were all well-loved. Service was also attentive and impeccable. Highly recommended for business and family gathering.
4
I have been going to this Shanghai restaurant consistently for more than four years. The food is always on point, and most importantly, it's ReAsonable price in the heart of Singapore, a 6 star mall.You can order anything you like from the menu and be safe in the knowledge that it's going to be great. Highly Recommended: Brasied Soon Hock Fish in Claypot!The place does get kind of loud, and if you don't book ahead then you're probably going to be waiting a while for a table. But that's just because lots of people are there having a great time!
5
One of our favorite place to dine in Singapore . Good service , good ambience and food . Recommended
5
It's one of my favourite restaurants. Food is very good, staff are extremely friendly and they are accommodating with bringing your own wines.
4
This is the spot we usually come for weekend family gathering. Good qualify food and ambience. Friendly stuff. Highly recommended.
5
the food is very delicious, esp steamed pork dumpling snd deep fried scallion pastry. i strongly recommended deep fried crispy duck.
by the way the staff and environment is very friendlyan nice.
5
Quality service and food. Do not miss out on their dong bo meat and cod fish. Love the branch at Taka especially.
5
Super good food and service! This is my second time here and I can't wait to try the prawns with egg white!
5
super nice environment and food! must come for any chinese cuisine lover in singapore. a great place to try out!
5
Great tasting smoked duck, u can smell and taste the aroma of the duck smoked with tea. Really nice ambience and great device too. Will definitely visit again!
4
Located in Parkway parade marine parade road it serve Cantonese dim sum, noodles, congee and mixed meats.I chose the Lai Wan congee that has fish slices, lean meat, cuttlefish and fried dough. The congee is smooth and savory.Haha here water is not charged. Wet towels, tea and pickles are. It is a new outlet in the east
4
We were there early evening, before the dinner crowd.Waited patiently for about five minutes, while two receptionists were busily chatting away at the phones. Rather disappointing level of service for a supposed Michelin rated restaurant...Once we were seated though, service changed dramatically. Eagle-eyed waiters anticipated our every need.The food is truly fantastic, although rather rich for my taste. The stir fried sprouts and beans were crisp, the cabbage sweet
5
I had been to this restaurant with a large group of friends and whilst I had enjoyed the food, I found myself talking a lot and did not give the food the attention it deserved.This time, I came for lunch and we concentrated on the Dim Sum which was really excellent, we drank jasmine tea. The restaurant is large but the clever arrangement of tables gave the feeling of privacy. The service was excellent and the price for 3 was only Sing $75 for 3. The restaurant is located in the very busy Takashimaya on Orchard Road, however inside it is very calm
4
Quick service and very nice ambience! We have a quick lunch here, we have noodle toss with scarpion oil, steam dumpling and pot stickers, kids love it, recommended!
5
This is one my favourite Chinese restaurants in Singapore. The food is great, the service is also excellent. I highly recommend this restaurant for all occasions.
4
We've been here a few times and the food is always good and consistent. The ambience is always pleasant
4
Wanted to try their standard sets and compare to restaurants like majestic ......Wonderful tasting but portions too small .... 4 stars as such.
5
Went there twice in a month. Not so crowded so good environment. Food is so nice and traditional Shanghainese which made us nostalgic!
4
Spacious with many cosy corners, and good service. We enjoyed a refreshing shredded vegetables & beancurd salad. The Deep fried Yellow Croaker fish was very crunchy but super salty the day we were there! Their Stewed Pork belly was not memorable. The chef cooked a superb crab with white flat rice vermicelli and we found a good warm fermented rice dessert. Most pleasant.
4
If you're adventurous enough, step into the restaurant and engage the waiters. Ask about the specials and go from there. Some of their best stuff aren't in the menu.The food was great today. The staff though could do with a bit more smile. It wasn't that they were incompetent, they were just rather dead-faced
4
There are many restaurants that form part of the Imperial Treasure Group and it's always a pleasure to come back and eat here. As in the name the chefs here prepare an extensive array of traditional Shanghai cusine. The service and staff are always friendly and the food really good especially if you enjoy eels. The lay out of the restaurant means you can be dining in one of the pods at the front of the restaurant or for bigger groups in the main dining area or in one of the priviate rooms
5
Five point are not enough . Staff is polite and service is speed and professional. Food is perfect, spicy dumplings and deep fried chicken with hand made sauce. All served with tea. A good dessert: milk coconut pudding with yellow beans. Atmosphere is perfect. For sure I will be back for other dinners.
5
Business partners took me here as it is convenient location in Takashimaya department Store / in the heart of orchard road.Food is fabulous, all type of dinsum, rice, noodles or crispy squid...Lovely desserts too.I am not aware of the price but surely worth is as food and service standard are superb
5
One of my favourite restaurants in Singapore...seats are wide and restaurant is not overly crowded. Food is really good although pricey. Service always excellent!
4
Satisfactory dinner. We started with few cold dishes then shanghai sweet shrimps, stewed pork belly, noodleand hotpot. Delicious good quality dishes.
5
I was brought here yesterday by an old friend. From the outset, it already exudes a sense of poshness, and air of elegance. The service was great and the food ... fantastic. The place is my benchmark for high end Chinese cuisine in Singapore.
5
It is not easy to find excellent Shanghai dim sum in Singapore yet Imperial Treasure have managed to master the art. As stated by others the xiaolongbao is not only extremely tasty but the skin is exceptionally thin. The same applies to the other dim sum eats and the various flavours of the individual dishes manage to stand out.The service is first class and the knowledgeable staff are happy to assist with your selection. The other plus point is that the restaurant is spacious so it is not too noisy. Prices are a little on the high side but the food is of a very high quality. Highly recommended
5
we visit almost once every two weeks. their xiaolongbao is one of the best in Singapore ( and vs. HK ). Usuallly Shanghai cuisine is a bit heavy on the sauce, flavors but Imp Treasure does it clean, exquisite but still flavorful. The staff are attentive and prompt, and remember customers' names and preferences. Prices are very reasonable and we always leave happy
5
Happen to come by for a meal and am Super impressed with both the food and service! Very good food and staff are friendly and helpful!
5
Our friends from Singapore took us to Imperial Treasure for lunch and were in charge of ordering. The dumplings were so thin and the flavor so full it is hard to match in the US. We had the river eel dish with garlic, not on the menu, so order ahead. The service is fast and they watch your every need before you can ask. We had a special cold shaved veggies with tofu that was very refreshing with all the other flavors. Don't be fooled because so many of the excellent restaurants are on the top floors of shopping centers. There are several of the Imperial Treasure restaurants but each one serves cuisine from different regions of Chinq
4
Located on the 4 th level just outside the Takashimaya . Good and friendly service staffs Must try the assortment of cold dishes . The Smoked duck is excellent -Aromatic and soft We went as a couple so could not order too much food . There are good selection on the menu . Highly recommended
5
This restaurant is part of the Imperial Treasure group of fine eateries.They serve fine and authentic Shanghainese cuisine, which is quite rare in Singapore.Pricing can be high, but so is the quality of dishes and the service in general.Try their smoked fish, bean curd skin with beans and finish off with their red bean paste pan cake for dessert.Highly recommended
5
Imperial Treasure's xiao long bao (soup dumplings) is as good as Din Tai Fung's, which my family adore. The skin is super thin (which makes it a challenge preventing leaks enroute to one's mouth!) but is absolutely scrumptious. Everything we had - particularly the wantons in chilli vinegar and red bean fried pancakes - were great. To top it all, the staff were super attentive and couldn't do enough to make my 90+ year-old father's visit enjoyable and comfortable. An outstanding experience from start to finish

@TheKuoKnowsShanghai restaurants tend to be a rarity in Singapore. In fact, Shanghai eateries can be few and far between, outside of China's most populated city. (Hong Kong is a notable exception, though.)Exactly why that is the case is a little puzzling because the dishes are remarkably tasty, if I say so myself, as a half Shanghainese!Imperial Treasure Shanghai Cuisine, which is located in Ngee Ann City on Orchard Road, is a champion of excellent Shanghai food in Singapore. The dishes are authentic and clean, and even be better than the fare served in Shanghai.Saute shrimps are a great way to start off the meal. Delicately small and unbelievably fresh - it really does set the juices flowing. It has always puzzled me, though, as to who could possibly have the patience to peel the soft shells from the tiny crustaceans so perfectly. They must have very small hands!The braised mince pork, which is better known as Lion's Head, is a must. They are a Shanghai classic. The patties are light and fluffy, which is a testament of the chef's patience and cullinery skills.For a welcome departure to your traditional choice of fish, give the braised eels a try. They go remarkably well with steamed or fried bread, which the restaurant also does to perfection.If you can find room for dessert, the rice in young wine is quirkily interesting. It is also uniquely Shanghainese. There is a slight hint of alcohol, but definitely not enough to even tickle a breathalyser.Imperial Treasure Shanghai Cuisine is a great credit to Shanghai food. It is much more than a treasure - it is a precious jewel

Imperial Treasure Shanghai Cuisine is not difficult to find. In the middle of year 2013, this restaurant offering high quality Shanghai food and dim sum, took over the space formerly occupied by Coca steamboat restaurant on the 4th floor inside the Takashimaya shopping centre. The space is actually part of the atrium so the interior is narrow and curved. You cannot miss the nine wooden pods that line the sides of the restaurant, each partially enclosing a table and shielding you from the atrium. The ambiance is not spectacular but the service is excellent and food is good. Besides offering some privacy in the booth-like pods, there are also rooms for private dinning. We were there for a birthday lunch and had the following dishes:Starters were: The lucky birthday buns; marinated black fungus; the thousand layer pig’s ear; deep fried eel fillet; and a mushroom-filled pancake. All these were tasty, and the portions adequate to wet your appetite. The eel fillets were sugary and crunchy, the black fungus sweetly pungent and crunchy too. Next we were served the popular sautéed shrimps with honey peas in black truffle oil. I like that the truffle aroma was not overpowering, the shrimps firm and the peas bursting in your mouth. Following this was the fragrant steamed spinach which was refreshing, not oily and light. The deep fried Soon Hock in sweet and sour sauce with pine nuts I found a little too sweet. The sauce which was thickly covering the fish was perhaps too generous. Next came the smoked duck with tea leaves. No greens. The duck had a delicious aroma, but parts were a little saltish. Their Xiaolong bau was next. The thin skin didn’t break when picking these up and the baus were delicious with the ginger and vinegar sauce. Finally we had the lobster noodles. Presentation was nice, the lobster portions easy to manage without getting your fingers messy, but again I found this preparation slightly too saltish for me. For desert, we had the fried pancake.Plates were frequently changed. Tea cups filled when these were noticed to be half full or empty. Noise levels comfortable. No need to shout to be heard across the tables. WiFi available free courtesy of Takashimaya. Wheel-chair friendly. Separate toilets for male and female at the back of the restaurant. Bookings advised and the restaurant gets crowded especially with shoppers during lunch time.Address: Takashimaya S.C., #04-22, 391A Orchard Road, Singapore 238873. Tel: 6836 6909Opening Hours: 11:30 – 3:00pm, 6:00pm – 10:30pm (Mon-Fri), 11:00am-2:30pm, 6:00pm-11:00pm (Sat), 10:30am-2:30pm, 6:00pm-11:00pm (Sun

Highly recommend this restaurant for their excellent food and service. The dim sum, veggies and noodles are delicious and eclectic as are the desserts! As for main courses, there is an excellent and numerous selection. Would highly recommend this place. Lastly, ask to be seated in the pods!
5
Located on the 4th floor of Ngee Ann City/Takashimaya you'll find Imperial Treasure's Shanghai Cuisine. They do offer Shanghai dim sum at lunch times too. The service is great and the food high quality. Do book as the restaurant does get very busy
4
The restaurant is tastefully furnished and service good. It serves very high quality Shanghai cuisine. The most memorable dishes we had that night was the deep fried frog's legs, the sweet pea and shrimp infused with truffle oil, and the crab in glutinous rice. The other dishes are also very well executed
4
Every time, I dine here, food is always good and service is as ever efficient. The setting is not like typical Chinese restaurant. It is more cozy and privacy and not like big restaurant with sea of tables and chairs.Very nice dining venue to stop by during or after the shopping. Recommend to anyone who wants good and authentic cuisine
4
A regular venue for corporate dinner, located at the fourth floor of Ngee Ann City. Came for a simple dinner this week. Had pickled cucumber skin roll, marinated jelly fish head and deep fried anchovies for appetizers. For mains, tried the marinated salted chicken, double boiled cabbage soup with mushroom, sautéed sea perch with celery & preserved olives, steamed egg white with mushrooms. For dessert, had the mooncakes and deep fried water chestnut roll. There is a good wine list and there is no corkage if you BYO. Good service and they change glasses if you have a flight of wine for tasting.
5
With a very peacful atmosphere, this Imperial Treasure is truly one to remember. My family and I have made a habit of coming to this restaurant every week. Service is quick and friendly, and you are never unattended. Anyone who is a fan of cantonese and chinese food must come and try this restaurant experience
5
IMO, Imperial Treasure Shanghai cuisine serves the best original flavor Xiao Long Bao. The skin was translucent, meat was juicy and tonnes of soup. Fish head is a must try too. Lastly, the service is excellent
5
I'm surprised that this restaurant brands itself as a Shanghainese restaurant when there are no employees who are Shanghainese. But nonetheless, their food was very authentically Shanghainese. As a Shanghainese myself, I have tried so many restaurants that claim to serve Shanghainese cuisine outside of Shanghai but only to be disappointed. This restaurant, although I was very suspicious at first, completely delighted me with their dishes. Their kofu was incredibly authentic. Their large plate items were very creative. The only dish I thought was not authentic was the "tang cu pai gu" -- the flavor was way off and it just didn't taste good even by non-Shanghainese standards. Everything else we ordered was superb, not to mention the delicate desserts. I'm so glad I found this place! I've been craving authentic Shanghainese food for over a year and this has finally satisfied my craving!
5
For us this was the best Dim Sum we have had since leaving HK 6 years ago. Nice settings and really fantastic flavor from the stuffing as well as the sources.
4
This restaurant which is located on the 4th floor in the Takashimaya Shopping mall serves excellent Chinese food. Service is good.....much better than the other branches of Imperial Treasure.Staff are friendly and proactive in anticipating customers requests.Unlike most Chinese restaurants the ambiance plus the not too crowded sitting makes this a perfect place for a relaxing meal.Although the restaurant is renown for Shanghainese cuisine,other cantonese and chinese dishes are available on the menu.Prices are above average but guess one has to pay a "premium" to enjoy delicious food in nice surroundings
4
Our host ordered a lot of different dishes . All of them were fresh, delicate and light. No excessive oil, or salt.. The dumplings were very very good with nice and fragrant soup inside. Excellent smoked duck. Excellent rice noodles. Probably the top Chinese restaurant French Ramsay has visited in Singapore. No corkage fee. All tables are very private, so the restaurant is elegant and quiet. Service was very courteous and nice. A great evening. We will definitely go back
5
I like this one because it is usually not too crowded, the only reason being Shanghainese cuisine may not be the top choice for everyone when compared to other types of Chinese cuisine - Cantonese, Teochew etc. Being a regular here also means they will always get me a table. The service here is probably the best amongst all their branches.

I live in New York and I have never, ever felt motivated to type a bad review for a restaurant. Everyone has good and bad days. But the treatment we received at this restaurant was inexcusably bad. When we first sat down, staff brought us pickled cabbage and put it on our table. They also brought tea and asked us if we wanted tea. We said yes, and they brought over a pot of tea. We the ordered a bottle of wine which the waitperson barely knew how to order. She also whisked away the cork because I believe it was bad. In any case, we proceeded to taste the wine. It was bad and had turned. I had a colleague of mine taste it. She agreed that it was bad. Then the manager came over and claimed that he was a sommelier. We explained that the wine was bad. He said it wasn't. I asked him to taste the wine. He made a big show of smelling it and telling us that it smelled 'smokey.' He repeated this several times. He then tasted it and informed me that the wine was fine and that I just didn't know what French wine is supposed to taste like. Indeed, if we wanted another bottle, we would have to pay for both the bad wine and the new bottle. "How many bottles will I have to open for you?" he asked. "I am only being fair." "If you are actually a sommelier, can you please explain to me why you let me taste the wine in the first place if you had no intention of caring what I thought of the bottle?" I asked, to which he had no reply. In the end, we didn't order another bottle (obviously). But not only did the restaurant charge us for it, they also charged us for the unsolicited tea and pickles. AND they had the nerve to try to give us the un-drunken bottle as we were leaving. Yes, the food is great. But the service is unaccountably horrendous and I could never recommend this to anyone
5
Definetly the best! A little difficult to find, as it's inside the Takashimaya dept, but once you are there you're in the heaven! Warm welcome from the friendly staff, and courtesy at any moment.Foods are deliciuos. Can't miss roast duck and chicken, noodles, and differente kind of soups. It's my favourite restaurant when I stay in singapor
5
The xiao long bao here is sublime. Thin delicate dumpling skin, juicy filling, every dumpling is a delight. Same goes for the guo tie, which are all crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. If you stick to the dim sum menu, you can probably get a pretty good value-for-money lunch. We, however, veered off into the a la carte menu and started ordering dishes from there: that's how our bill added up. Still, the food is good enough to tell myself I'm giving me a treat
5
Imperial Treasure has a chain of restaurants catering to different palates and this is the first time that I've tried their Shanghai cuisineWe ordered the usual Shanghai snacks e.g. spring onion pancakes, dumpling and sheng jian bao etc - though these are common snacks, Imperial treasure did theirs in a finer and more exquisite way. We also enjoyed the wanton and chicken soup and fried rice - though seemed to be simple dishes, again Imperial treasure managed to elevate it to a higher level.We enjoyed the dinner so much that my friend and me wanted to bring our mums here for their birthdaysPrice is on the high side but with the service, ambience and high quality of food - I think it's totally worth
4
Although the restaurant is located in Singapore's Takashimaya near the famous Kinokuniya bookshop, inside the restaurant there is a peaceful environment as food lovers enjoy the deliciousfood. I was on my way to a show so I could not linger too long. I enjoyed the Wanton in a spicy chilli sauce then enjoyed the pork dumplings and the eggplant & pork. I enjoyed the sweet pumpkin pastry
4
Elegant setting, fine Shanghainese cuisine and attentive service. Memorable dishes include the smoked pigeon, sharks fin with chicken and yunnan ham, giant meatball with cabbage and Mee suah. Desserts cannot be missed. We had a platter of 3 types of dessert - fried pumpkin slices, red bean sesame ball and the lightest melt in the mouth fried ball with banana red bean stuffing. Glutinous rice in Chinese rice wine was also very interesting and apparently has some health-giving properties.
4
Restaurant was very busy when we ate there and deservedly so! We ate from a set menu that gave a really good selection of dishes - didn't need rice. Would go again.
5
Really good food with great service. Pls call ahead and reserve, otherwise might end up waiting more than an hour. My regular family dishes are the dried noodles with scallion, steamed vegetable dumplings, red bean bun, bean curd salad and egg fried rice.
4
Than many restaurant like paradise dynasty, ding tai feng and crystal jade. You can forget their wanton noodles, I think kopitiam better :)
Service here is good, the aunties are friendly.
5
Whilst doing some serious shopping on Orchard road we found ourselves hungry just as we were walking by this restaurant. What a find! We were extremely impressed with the service and food quality and the prices were simply the icing on the cake. The absolute stand out was yhe tea smoked duck, absolutely amazing and the little cloud like buns were like something from a dream. Amazing
4
Heard many good things about this restaurant and after getting a group of 5 together, we were impressed with Imperial Treasure's offerings of:Xiao long bao (from memory, they come in a basket of 6 or 8)Drunken chickenEggplant & minced porkPork belly served with small steamed bunsShizi tou (a marinated meatball) with Chinese cabbageYangzhou fried riceNote that it's better to go in a group of 4+ people to be able to sample the dishes better.All dishes were of a high standard though the eggplant was a bit salty and the pork belly comes served with string made of lotus leaf (I may be wrong about the lotus leaf) which is tough to remove even with a knife and fork.I hardly eat Shanghainese food so being able to have good quality xiao long bao and marinated meatball is great as places like Din Tai Fung can get crowded. We were also impressed with the service as orders are taken promptly and food was served very efficiently. Our tea cups were never empty as the wait staff were always ready to top up without asking. As other diners have pointed out, it is a bit expensive but you do get what you pay for.Other reviewers have also compared Imperial Treasure with Crystal Jade and I can only say that both are of a decent quality however, visit this Imperial Treasure for specialised Shanghainese dishes. Crystal Jade restaurants aren't as well decorated but tend to do Cantonese cuisine better (dim sum, roasted meats, congee etc) at a more reasonable price
4
We are impressed with the consistent quality of food churned out by the Imperial Treasure chain of restaurants. On an evening when we were craving for good tasting simple food, we decided on dinner at Imperial Treasure in Ngee Ann City. The restaurant is very cosy and new. We decided on the roast pork, daily soup, steamed fish and stir fried kai lan with beef. Have to say every dish was great. In my humble opinion, the quality of food served by Imperial Treasure surpasses that of Crystal Jade. The standard of food is what Crystal Jade used to be. My family are fans of Imperial Treasure and we will be back more often than before

I say this straight up... I'm more partial to the Imperial Treasure Group of restaurants more so than the Crystal Jade Group, simply because I feel that the former has done more and has place more effort in putting quality food on every one of their tables, whilst I've been disappointed a couple of times at different Crystal Jade outlets to the point where I now gravitate towards Imperial Treasure outlets more... in a way, I feel that it's a safe bet for a better meal...We've eaten here about a half a dozen times now and to be honest, there were some items that we didn't really like, mostly some of the 'authentic' shanghai dishes that have a bit of a 'pong'.. either derived from certain preserved meats or certain veggies (I think), but overall, like all Imperial Treasure outlets, we would keep going back over and over again..This particular Sunday lunch, I did plan on taking more pictures, which I actually forgot to, after the third dish because I was too engrossed stuffing my face! :-pThe jellyfish appetizer, xiao long bao and pot-stickers (dunno how to spell the Chinese name) were all excellent with the xiao long bao, to me, being a more refined version of those offered at Din Tai Fung (not that I don't like them there, as I eat at Din Tai Fung quite a bit too) and the superstar must be the pot-stickers as I'm told by the captain that they're made a la minute, actually has meat juice inside, and to me, the best I've had.

We ordered a few dishes including xiaolongbao, jellyfish, shrimps and eels. The food was quite good, although it was slighlty expensive. The staff were friendly, efficient and alert. They took our orders promptly, and were alert to fill up our glasses before they went empty. The staff were quick to change our plates as well, making sure we had new plates for new dishes. We were overall impressed with the good service

I was for the first time in this restaurant giving a Birthday lunch treat to a girl friend at her choice of venue. Was I impressed? No! Would I go back ? No! Here are the reasons why:1) For 3 of us, we opted for the set 6 course lunch menu + dessert.The bill for food, and just  Chinese tea came up to SGD 192. In spite of the many courses, I came away from lunch  feeling still hungry.2) Serving style and presentation was an imitation of the western Novelle Cuisine, which by the  way, is now passe. The portions served were very, very small. In fairness, I'd like to say the food was usual and good in taste, service was very attentive  and decor definitely up-market. However, this westernised concept of fine Chinese dining is not for me.When I go to a Chinese restaurant I'd like food to be presented and served in the  the traditional Chinese way

Although I am not a big fan of Shanghai cuisine because it tends to be heavy, I must say the execution here is excellent. The soups are very refined; we had the fish maw Ji Cai thick soup which was outstanding. The crab and crab roe with glutinous rice, a heavy dish, is yummy. Surprisingly, the xiǎolóngbāo is not the best we've had, even in Singapore. The deep-fried crispy eel fillet is way too sweet. For non-amateurs of Shanghai cuisine, there are of course plenty of other options. Maybe because the restaurant is new, but service is the best among all the Imperial Treasure eateries. We had 6 changes of plates during lunch! The decor is elegant and offers a feeling of spaciousness
