We order roasted chicken, roasted pork and tofu hot plate. All meal are good but not special. It is kinda traditional Chinese resto at United Square.

Quite simply, amongst the best chicken rice I've ever eaten. And the char siew and roast pork is sublime too. Don't let the naysayers put you off! The crowds of regular customers is testimony to the quality of the food.

Went here primarily for the chicken rice, which was very good. Fresh meat and served quickly. Reasonable prices ($7 for a set and $5 beer). Also hot a bean curd hot pot dish which was yummy. Friendly staff in a simple setting.

The place gets very crowded as soon as opens. It is small place with local's Favorite dishes. We had roasted and steamed chicken rice and was really good with their ginger and sambol. Their noodle/veggie combo was also good. This place is just outside the mall

I have been eating here 3-4 times in the past year and my family really liked the chicken rice. This time however the meat was very dry and the skin not chewy at all. The restaurant was full house at that time and maybe we were just unlucky that the kitchen had a bad day. Maybe we will come back on a not so busy day. Service was good, but a bit slow due to the restaurant being busy. The atmosphere is old school and nice

We have eaten at this restaurant on several occasions and have enjoyed all of our meals. The house speciality of Chicken Rice is served with a side dish of chicken broth and is quite filling as are all of their meals. The quality of meals/service is evidenced by full houses at peak dining time, however their efficient service has your meal served in a short time, the beer is always nice and cold. Expect to be welcomed/farewelled by the Manager and long time owner in appreciation of your dining with them

The restaurant is very old school - it felt like we took a step back into the 70s or 80s when we walked in. The chicken was tender, while rice was not too oily. The chilli went very well with both of these. My daughter also had roasted pork (烧肉) which was crispy and tasted nice. The stir-fried vegetables with garlic was a hit with everyone too

Our trip to SG is never complete if we don't find time to have Hainanese Chicken Rice at Wee Nam Kee at its Thomson Road branch. From a "hole in the wall" restaurant, it has moved to United Square and has grown to 4 branches.The chicken is quite excellent, whether steamed or roasted, especially if paired with fragrant rice. You can order a meal set of Chicken Rice, complete with soup. The price is very affordable, will not hurt your budget. If you think chicken is the only meal in the menu, think again!If you want to give it a try, you have to come early for lunch or dinner since there's a line. The place is accessible, take the MRT to Novena and you're just 10 minutes away from savoring the delicious chicken rice that only Wee Nam Kee is known for

This place has the feel of an old school Chinese coffee shop in Petaling Jaya in Selangor Malaysia. That's a good thing.The menu offers variety (see pictures), the food was delicious and the prices were reasonable. What we ate:1. A small plate of steamed chicken - a good portion for S$32. A small order of the Hainanese pork chop - served the traditional way with a light sweet and sour sauce3. Medium portion of Loofah melon vegetable stir fried with egg- an old school Cantonese dish 4. 3 bowls of chicken rice5. 2 glasses of homemade barely waterAll for S$27 (US$19).A lot has been said about the quality of the chicken rice - the house style here is a little on the chewy side but it's also less oily than that served in many other places. It's a matter of how important the rice is to you and how you like it. The house chilli has a good amount of bite (it's spicy) and there's also a generous amount of all you can eat minced ginger on the side too. For the uninitiated, you are meant to eat the chilli and minced ginger with the chicken or you could skip either. The dining room is well lit and charmingly old fashioned. Service is efficient and no nonsense

The constant quality of food from Nam Kee has not changed over the many years of visiting Singapore and dining here. Located as short walk from the Marymount MRT (and future Thomson MRT station), along Upper Thomson Rd, Nam Kee do much more than just chicken rice.All the dishes are super delicious and great value. Sitting outside has the added benefit of enjoying more space, but the inside tables are just as good. My group prefer to sit outside since one member of the group is wheel-chair bound and it makes more sense to form a table out on the patio area

If you want to try authentic chicken rice, this is one good restaurant to try out. It maintains the old HK style restaurant décor, with good affordable food.
Try the Cha Siew!

Staple for upper Thomson with lots of new eateries popping up all over the place. One can always be assured of consistently fast food with home cooked taste.

I always have a high standard rating system for chicken rice as I born in Ipoh which is famous in the whole Malaysia and perhaps even in Asia for its bean sprout chicken. Here the chicken taste is inconsistent. Roasted chicken breast is rough and dry. Steamed chicken has strong chicken smell. Price is slightly expensive and I don't really recommend coming to eat here

Nam Kee Chicken Rice is a coffee shop with a simple and rather traditional set-up along Upper Thomson Road that has been known for its chicken rice for quite some time. They serve a variety of dishes besides the usual chicken and rice .I was not impressed with the quality of food and service, the chicken rice was not acceptable for a traditional Singaporean dish, It was gooey and broken and the flavour was tasteless.While the chicken is nice and tender, the portions are small. The rice was what totally changed my impression of the stall. Unfortunately, I find Nam Kee Chicken Rice pretty over-rated. There are many better and possibly cheaper stalls out there

If anyone would like to experience the worst kind of service in a Singapore restaurant, please visit Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice at United Square. First of all, expect to wait in a long queue outside the restaurant with no one taking your booking. When you finally got a table, you may be straining your neck and raising your hand up for hours before anyone take your order. To bring this experience up a notch, most of the staff including the cashier, waitresses, cleaners are rude and indifferent to customer's requests.By the way, many locals who have eaten here are fully aware that the food flavour is just average. And you can get the same kind of taste in many food courts, hawker centres or coffee shops in Singapore with much better service

Nam Kee has been in business for many years and I used to frequent it as a teenager. I was curious to know if Nam Kee had changed after 25+ years. It hadn't. Sweet memories were re-lived as I once again tasted the almost-perfect rice and tender succulent chicken. Nam Kee also serves other dishes like deep fried tofu and seasonal vegetables. "Old school" is how I would describe Nam Kee. No frills. Great taste. Hopefully won't be overtaken by newer players while demanding Singaporeans expect new/fusion tastes

A pot of soup arrived first, followed by our chicken and bowls of rice. The dishes were simply plonked onto our round table and no one bothered to announce what the dish was. When the table was full (we ordered chicken, vegetables, braised eggs, some innards, rice and drinks), the sour-faced servers did not even bother to help rearrange dishes - they simply placed the additional items around whatever empty space they could see on our table (which also meant, at the edge by someone's elbow!)The vegetables were either too old or overcooked - it was hard to chew and tough!The chicken was nothing to rave about as well (disappointingly) - lacking tenderness and smoothness, that we felt the other chicken rice houses (i,.e. competitors) did much better even at their hawker stall outlets.Most importantly, the chicken rice itself did not posess the fragrant aroma of ginger-chicken broth at all. Granted, it was not very greasy, but the taste of a good bowl of chicken rice complements the chicken at times, especially when the chicken in question here was bland.Four of us spent a total of SGD$66.00, and with such service and food standards, rest assured that it was the first and last visit from any of us. It was a disappointing meal, to say the least.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/08/lunch-at-wee-nam-kee-chicken-rice.htm

Discovered this place while exploring the stretch of eateries along thomson road. Attracted by its rather traditional and retro layout and design , seems like time stops at the 1980s in this restaurant. Ordered their chicken rice and 2 ala cart dishes to go along. Taste is not bad, lightly seasoned and salted. May not suit those heavily seasoned taste buds. Food is not expensive, and probably worth coming back in future , at least to enjoy the ambience which brings back memories of the past

The chicken is tender. The skin over the pieces of chicken is smooth but without the gelatinous layer under the skin like at Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice that is so tempting to dive into. At Wee Nam Kee, the chicken sits on a layer of sweet-savory soy sauce that is very tasty (at Tian Tian, a golden glaze is used instead).When it comes to choosing a personal favorite establishment for chicken rice, it is more than the chicken itself that come into consideration. The accompanying rice, chilli sauce, and ginger sauce are as important and they complete the chicken rice experience. The gold standard of rice that is part of the chicken rice experience should be fragrant (traditionally, uncooked rice is fried with chicken fat before the rice is placed in the rice cooker). At Wee Nam Kee, the rice is almost reminiscent of brown rice and without much hint of fragrance, though the chilli and ginger sauce are pretty good. Overall, the whole chicken rice experience is not at the level of our favorite (Tian Tian)

Had been eating this chicken rice since I was a kid. . Since 30 years on the food was excellent but recently till this last round I dined. .. the steamed Chicken and a la carte menu food was very bad. MoSt properly the chef had been changed or maybe passed on..I don't know ... coz the way it was cooked and taste was very amateur. . Particularly a simple fried prawn omelette. . It was a disaster! It was more like sunny side up omelette! Also the skill of chopping the chicken was like kenna lang kar on a plate!! Meaning it was messy and looked unappetising! Also wait wait wait for everthing! so one can exercise patience here. Service is zero. I am very sad to say...I will never patronize again...I can only reminisced the good old days
