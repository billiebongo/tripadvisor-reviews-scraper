This restaurant is recommended. Very nice pier view with very good food. The place is relaxing and feel like out of the busy city area, retreat feel.
5
Great food and good service with great view. Book thru Chope 1 hr before and staff were well ready to received us.
4
Ambience was good and service was excellent as well. They have lunch sets which are quite good but portion is small though. Overall, good experience.
5
It's a nice authentic jap restaurant tucked away in Keppel Bay. Prices are very reasonable for the great food. Most like is the Yuzu Sake. Thank you for the great service too!!
5
Went for their set menu lunch and the food and presentation was stunning - probably the best Japanese meal I have ever had. The sashimi was fresh and so tender teeth were optional, the other courses were just as good.
5
I've always been impressed with the service here. The service staff are attentive and always friendly. The Japanese cuisine here has an authentic feel and has that special something not all local Japanese restaurants have. I was here for a special dinner with my wife and it was definitely worth it to me. It helps that the location is in a very nice marina
5
The food is really great and perfectly prepared/displayed. Having said that, we were given a place behind a column and felt a bit left out by the waitresses. I shall comeback again... but will get a better place. The salmon teppan and the sashimi were delicious!!!
5
Nice restaurant facing the Keppel Marina, the food is fresh and delicious. We went here for lunch. The lunch set are affordable (cheap for that quality), a bit expensive for dinner a la carte menu.I chose the Mazu zen set, a bento meal with a bit of everything: fresh sashimi, shawanmushi, miso soup, grilled fish, beef on garlic rice, tempura and cold soba and a trio of dessert (matcha cake, vanilla ice-cream and coconut pan cotta).The service is also very good, efficient and kind.If you seat at the counter, you can enjoy the view on the marina and watch the cooks preparing the dishes.Very nice experience. I will come back again for sure
3
Cozy and quiet space with Tabanyaki seats. Around 10+ tables. Remote location with excellent view and path for walk around. Food else is decent, fresh sashimi but nothing to shout about. Pricey is the word. Not exactly value for money but they probably don't intend to be

Our second time at the restaurant, we were quite disappointed with the food. Our first experience was fantastic! Both times, the staff were friendly and welcoming. Our second time, with a baby. Very family friendly. There were 3 babies in the restaurant and 2 toddlers. The quality and taste of the food however had declined drastically. The sashimi was mediocre. We were incredibly disappointed with the garlic fried rice which was quite the reason for our return. The rice was hard, stale and the garlic bits were hard without crisp. The restaurant was really hot despite the air conditioning
4
Had Soba and tempura lunch set. Soba was nice, tempura was crispy and this time it wasn't oily. one of the side dish "Inari Sushi" was surprisingly nice. Overall we had a great time. Will come back again.
5
The food is very delicious and authentic to the ones I have tried in Japan. The staffs are nice and friendly.
5
Offers live teppanyaki station during lunch. A nice and quiet dining ambience. Staff's polite and service is prompt. Would definitely recommend for those looking for authentic Japanese cuisine. We ordered one set of teppanyaki, and cooked bento set. Food's great!
5
Amazing ambience, waiters were spot on, and above all, the food was fantastic. Loved the green tea soba, and the toufu.
5
Great lunch deals starting from $15 for a 3 course sets starting with a chawan mushi, a main and a dessert along with complimentary Japanese tea. Cosy setting makes this a venue worth repeat visits.
4
Did a birthday celebration for my mother here. The environment was really good, and the food was delicious! There was a special event where a chef slid noodles down a bamboo slide for people to catch with their chopsticks. Really interesting experience!
5
We ordered the full omasake which starts with a simple starter, sashimi, fish soup, grilled fish, grilled chicken with veg, rice and dessert. The best would be the sashimi which was very fresh and of excellent quality amd beautifully presented. The rice is abit unwhelming for me. The dessert was the super japanese grade honeydew and ice cream.
4
Quality Japanese food that matches the price tag. The portions were on the small range what it lacked in quantity was made up by the quality of the ingredients they used for each dish. The atmosphere was nice and quiet, perfect for a romantic night out.
5
We came during lunch for its lunch set. Very value for money for quality food. Had teriyaki chicken set and salad with salmon. The salmon bits had a beautiful texture done in auburi style. Good service, great view.. it was a perfect afternoon. Just make sure u made a reservation as its quite popular during lunch time to avoid disappointment
2
We ordered tempra soba lunch set, tempra was crispy and soba was nicely cooked, unfortunately we felt the tempura oil wasn't fresh, felt very gassy in the stomach afterwards. And the worst was the dessert.. they gave us ice cream with red bean. Red bean was spoilt, tasted sour.. me and my friend had very bad stomachache and diarrhea..and the aircon was not coming to my seat so it was unpleasantly hot..I was surprised because the place usually serves very nice meal. And it's the first time I had such experience there. Will still give another chance though. Crossing our fingers!
4
lunch sets are affordable (average about 15++) but some dishes (eg. negi toro don) run out quite quickly. it will be better if the restaurant can update and change their lunch sets menu from time to time. service is generally good.
4
The food at Takumi was really yummy, and it was good value for money. Was satisfied with the dining experience and will be back!
4
Not crowded. Lunch Omakase was not bad $80 for full course and $50 for half course. They have a wide range of food available.
5
Brought my relatives for lunch at Takumi Restaurant at Keppel Island overlooking the breathtaking Caribbean Keppel By the Bay and all the magnificent yachts.We are greeted when we arrived and showed to a room that overlooking the bay and Singapore Cruise Centre.We ordered the Chirashi Sushi Set (come with miso soup, chawanmushi, rice and dessert) Assorted Tempura, Beef Steak, Isaki Shio and ice green tea.We are very happy with the service and recommend you to come and eat at Takumi Tokyo at Keppel Island with amble parking space
4
In all Japanese restaurants, the most important is whether is really freshly flown in or is sitting in the fridge for days before consumption. This particular restaurant fulfilled all these important requirements.It is a bit pricey but the quality and the ambience justify for this
5
Was here when my friend treat me for my birthday. We ordered the menus set as well as the Imakase set. The food presentation were great and every dish were explained to us whenever it is served. Seafood were very fresh. The ambience was good too and not too noisy. I highly recommend the Imaskase se
2
Reserved 3 sets of Negi Toro Don in Chope booking but was told on arrival at restaurant that this dish 's not available. Restaurant should have called to inform in advance so that we could still change the restaurant venue. We chose this restaurant solely because of this dish.. We decided to stay put and ordered something else instead. Disappointed
4
It was a quiet thursday evening. The restaurant was not filled up but it was nice as sometimes when its too crowded you wont get the attention u deserved. The food was decent, but the teppenyaki portion could have been more. Some dishes like sukiyaki, the staff should serve with egg and rice, otherwise a tad too salty
3
I have visited the restaurant a few times. The recent experience with the service was bad( not the food): for example: waited more than 45 mins between courses, hot dishes served before my sushi( which I believe the staff forgot to prepare and I had to cancel after one hour and finished my meal w/o sushi). There were a few other mistakes. And I believe other tables complained about the service to
4
The service was very good as the staff were very attentive.Only downside is that I got a table right below the spotlight and it was rather glaring and i had to switch my seats as it was getting uncomfortable.Food was alright though and i wasn't blown away..
4
Good location - nearby yacht dock at the sea. Good ambience and not noisy. Traditional Japanese restaurant with good service.
4
Here you can enjoy tenpura, sushi, teppanyaki at a time. Also the quality of materials here are quite high and real Japanese. The location is also wonderful facing to Marina in Keppel Island. Only the problem is the price is not so reasonable
3
We regularly visit this restaurant for lunch, and we found the quality of food and service very good. However we were quite disappointed with our recent visit, the Japanese rice served was rather dry and over-night!
3
It's not my first time there but was a little disappointed with the food quality this time. Doesn't help when I have brought my clients there for a Omakase meal.
4
My first time at this Japanese restaurant. I was impressed by the Premium Sashimi. It was one of the best I had.
5
Great quality food here. The spending is not cheap but you certainly pay for the fine quality of raw fish and wagyu beef. Been here several times and the food is consistently good.
5
Had an awesome celebration at Takumi! Started with exquisite hot Sake followed by a the Teppan Asuka Set Dinner which was totally awesome. Great recommendations were made by their service staff and food was served very quickly. Had a very beautiful view of the Bay from the room thanks to their manager who made special arrangements to facilitate our request. Would definitely go back to Takumi again soon! Cheerssssssss~
1
Inconsistent service. I visit at least 2-3 times every month but the service is bad.No smiles, tell them there is a fly in my soup and was ignored. Always got to remind them to top up the hot tea or to give us our chawamushi and ice cream
5
It's authentic, operated by Japanese! They offered very good Japanese cuisine with creativity in it. It's our first choice for business meet up over a meal. It is advisable to call to make a reservation as it is quite pack up during lunch hours. It is located in the Keppel yatch club and self transportation would be recommended as it is not convenient for public transport. There are other coffee houses in the club if u may want to have your next chapter after lunch.
4
The ambience is lovely esp if you get the private room. Nice window view of the Bay! We took the Omakase menu where every dish is a surprise and chosen by the chef. We only requested for 2 items - Wagyu beef, which came as two tiny pieces on a stick, and garlic rice, which was delicious. The sashimi was fresh and tasty. The peeled king crab with roe was unusual and delectable. Service was attentive.
4
Good food, good prices and great location... What more could you ask for?
Decor is pleasant and food presentation is as important as the taste.
A great alternative location for a lunch time meeting and certainly more private and the major centers.
1
It was disgusting to find out that these wooden sake cups are being reused for other customers, its like reusing wooden chopsticks.
HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED! For a high end restaurant to act in such a way.
4
Superb lunch sets. And I'm referring to not just the price, which is extremely affordable. Considering the culinary standard and food quality they serve out, it is downright robbery.
4
We had a good dinner. Ambience was nice and not too rowdy. The food quality was good and services was courteous and nice.
4
We had the $20 Takumi set lunch and it is a lady dream lunch as it has a little of many dishes. Great service
4
Went for dinner with family so can't comment on the view but the service and food were of very high quality. The sashimi and beef were outstanding.
5
We've been here for lunch and found food and service to be unmemorable. That's what happens when a restaurant of this caliber jumps on the lunch bandwagon and tries to get a slice of the pie. Dinner on the other hand is quite the opposite - it is just outstanding, quality of food is top notch, service is excellent and great ambience. We started with the mixed tempura, chicken wings and then moved on to the teppanyaki - seared chicken, tuna (with ponzu dipping sauce and avocadoes) , garlic fried rice and miso soup. We will definitely be back
2
I had been to Takumi several times for lunch and felt the food was good and value for money. I was there again on 2 Oct Sunday for lunch and ordered the Teriyaki Chicken set. The chicken meat was tough and some parts not very cooked. I did not bother to complain as my mood was dampened and just wanted to leave the place
5
My third visit in a month for same restaurant, tried Omakase, Tempayaki and Mazu set!! All excellent and value for money! Yummy, good quality, reasonable price, nice environment and friendly waiter and waitress! What else to ask for? Definately highly recommended and will be back more often for sure
5
If you looking for a place for Tapenyaki or sashimi you found it. The location is very nice and the waiter are even more. We are here Tapenyaki with my wife and we enjoying our best diner in Singapore since we arrive there. I really recommend this place to everyone who love Japanese food. Also I will recommend you to let you guise by the waiter for the sake, they have various choices. Thanks to the staff for there assistant and also to the chef for his cuisine that was awesome.Taxi can be order if you arrived without a car as we did. Three Tapenyaki menu choice, 88 $sgp/ 100 or 128.We went for the 100$ one and it was perfect. Thanks Pierre

Very good food - we tried their set menu
Service was professional and friendly
Nice view of the Marina, great for a romantic dinner
Price - high
5
We booked thru chope. . Restaurant opened, we came in with staff unprepared. Manager on phone, and calling staff to approach us. It's Wednesday night. They are having somen event where were free. I'm joining the crowd.. the bamboo not well built, water was leaking out and fall exactly on my shoes. Food is great and fresh. Too bad the menu that I saw from chope were totally different from the menu they are serving. The Japanese lady told me that the menu I saw was eventually long long time ago which chope never updated the latest menu. Everything were good. Staff are nice and friendly especially the Japanese lady and a Chinese lady which I didn't noticed their name. Forgotten to charge me a bottle of sake and 2 glasses of asahi until I curious and found out why it was far cheaper than I expected. Should reward us for being honesty where called the Chinese waitress to correct it before we left. Overall everything still great. Thank
5
The lunch sets from as little as $15 is really value for money given the quality of the food. Not to mention the lovely view, ambience & service. The location is unique & convenient by car. Not too far to go to escape from the usual busy Singapore restaurant scene.
5
This restaurant is located in the beautifully yet tucked away area at Keppel Bay. The food quality is excellent especially the Wagyu beef and Foie Gras dishes. The staff were excellent. The only disappointment is the place is small so one must reserve a table to avoid disappointment. This gem overlooks the marina. I normally visit here once a month
5
We went for lunch with friends that are moving back to the UK. This was one of there favourite places to eat in Singapore. It's not the easiest place to get to on food so take a taxi.The food is amazing...yet I had no idea what I was eating at times. We did the chef's choice lunch, it was 8 courses and everyone was wonderful. We had homage tofu for the starter (I don't like tofu and loved this), a taster of sushi and a cold stewed plum (amazing), fish with broth and turnips, wagyu beef with asparagus, miso soup, rice with fish, picked vegetables with roasted fish, green tea ice cream with red beans (hard to describe, but the beans are sweet). Over all an amazing meal. We were a bit rushed, our fault. Take your time to savour eat course and splash out on amazing bottle of Sak
1
we didn't reserve a table and was offered a counter seats. By counter seats it means dirty tables (how dirty? placed my phone on the table and a layer of grease disgustingly coat the base). The glorious view of kitchen staff shouting at each other and heaps of dishes unwashed really makes me wonder why they would even bother to made it a proper counter table.Then I realised it is special because I saw my order had been prepared and left at the counter for 20mins before I finally asked for it - really made it a meal to remember.The smell of the chef frying heaps of fried rice jus about 2 Meters directly behind me while my order wasnt served really made the food extra nice. Due to our special seats, the waitress forgotten to serve us every so often.Went there for a date. I think my date had no intention to go back again
5
Food was not bad and plus point there is lunch set menu. The atmosphere is very pretty near Keppel. Was not feeling well and the staff were friendly and attentive and brought me a cup of warm water and keep checking if I was alright. Would recommend their service. Many thanks

I have been here twice - once on a J-passport promo of an omakase dinner at the chef's table, followed by a visit for their nagashi somen night.1st time impressions: Wow. It was a 8 course meal that I thoroughly enjoyed. Wagyu beef was served, so was a slew of kaiseki-like food. It was a weekday evening and it was quiet and relaxing. Me being the greedy pig was not full at the end of my omakase meal and the chef responded with giving me a bowl of tempura soba on the house. The femme maitre-d paid close attention to my sake cup that evening and made sure I was taken care of.2nd time: I went with my sister for their nagashi somen night. It was crowded! Very, very crowded. We got a table and ordered side dishes that we've not tried before and we're blown away. Granted we are not posh eaters, but we thought everything served was yummy. However, the somen night was a nightmare. Us Singaporeans being Singaporean rushed, crowded and made an entire mess of the restaurant as they tried to keep up with our demands for more noodles, sauce, and screams of wet clothes and wasted noodles on the floor. The staff were not frazzled but I could tell this is the usual for them. But the maitre-d and the chef recognized me from my first visit, 4 months later. I was very surprised, and they greeted my sister with the same courtesy they did for me on my birthday.There are reviews of this place being so-so, and I wonder if it's anything to do with crowded hours. The restaurant is pumping out more deals and discounts, but if you aren't the posh nosh and want to enjoy some great eats on a discount, look up a deal for this place and enjoy
3
This is my third time at this restaurant for lunch.Food is good value for the lunch deals. But my choice of chirashi on this visit was a disappointment as it was stone cold. Still the price of $15 for the whole set means that I shouldn't complain. My companion chose a higher priced set at $35 for a sashimi set which was very satisfying. The view from the restaurant is lovely
1
It was my second time to Takumi and I had a great first experience. I finally made it back and this time, they had a grilled cod with miso paste. The miso paste tasted so sour and off. I tried letting the manager know and he said its how its supposed to be taste. I explain that thats not how I'm accustom to tasting miso and its something that I definitely can't digest down. Not only did he not apologize but he did not even remove the dish away from the table nor suggest another solution. Its a very disappointing experience and service as I rarely fuss about food unless I truly cant digest it down. Definitely will not return again
4
staff was very helpful . Ambience was very good, we were given a very seats which private and comfortable. Only thing is , place is not easily accessible.
5
Absolutely Authentic Japenese food. The sashimi were great. Love the wagyu beef salad.
Very busy during lunch hours. Will recommend to make reservation. Will certainly come back again.
5
Good experience at Takumi. Quality Food by the chef. The food ingredients were fresh. Friendly staffs.
2
While the food was average +, the prices were very high for Singapore. Also it seemed that no one has been trained on proper service habits,,, servers scratching their itchy hair, and wait staff coughing constantly with open mouths.
5
A non-touristic restaurant in a industrial district. You will enjoy the various types of Japanese food. It is tasteful and another experience out of the various choices of food you can get in Singapore. The staff is very friendly, the restaurant is really cozy and nice. You will enjoy your stay
5
Definitely one of the best Japanese restaurants in Singapore. Have been there twice in 3 weeks. I love the cosy atmosphere with booth seats or teppanyaki and robata counter seat options. More importantly, the sashimi is always fresh, and the cooked foods are delicious and well prepared. We had the A5 premium wagyu beef which was absolutely delicious and the real deal - complete with certificate
4
I have been here on many occasions with different group of friends.They have extremely affordable set lunches. My regular would be the beef garlic fried rice.However, do note service may be slower on crowded days.Best to make reservation to secure a table, if not, you would be allocated by the 'bar'/teppanyaki area seats as per the pic.

If you want nice enough Japanese food, good ambience, nice surroundings, quiet location... Romantic walk under the stars after dinner. This is it. A seemingly authentic Japanese restaurant nestled in the quiet of keppel bay marina. The decor of samurai armor displays, Japanese style architecture is nice. The view by the bay... Lovely. The seaside experience, one of its kind. But the food? Sashimi was fresh enough. We had the platter for 1-2 pax. $38++. It was alright. The Aburi salmon Caesar salad? Hmm... Firstly the "croutons" were STALE. Lost its crunch and tasted bad. Disappointing for a $12 salad. If you can charge so much for a salad, you can make crunchy nicely buttered in-house croutons OR buy a box of nicely crunched crisp croutons from cold storage for $5. I'm just saying. Other than that, it was acceptable. I mean, it's a salad, how can it go wrong? But it did. We had the Aburi salmon roll. Disappointing for this kind of "high class" restaurant. The sushi rice was mushy. Not just sticky it was mushy. Overdone rice. Other than that, it was generally just "normal tasting". No wow factor for $18. Next we had the Hokkaido seafood hotpot which the waitress said was enough for 3 persons. When it arrived, it was in a clay pot the size of a one-person clay pot udon serving. No hurrahs about that. The taste was nice. The soup was flavorful and ingredients quite substantial for this small pot. But $35? I'm not so sure it's worth it. We finished the meal feeling abit empty. Less satisfied than we thought. For the same price, there are much better Japanese restaurants. But if what you want is to impress... Date... Clients... With a nice posh area of yachts and the sea view, plus you have dough to splash... Why not
5
I went to Takumi for dinner when they first opened in their current location many years back. Dinner was a little pricey. However, I re-visited Takumi again due to the recommendation of a Japanese colleague. We went during lunch time and discovered the best value Japanese lunch ever.
2
Actually looked forward to the dinner as I was yearning for Teppanyaki. although I "choped" the table I called just to get a table at the Teppanyaki counter. Sadly we were placed at the left hand secluded corner of the Teppanyaki table and was sort of left out of the scene. But what was really sad was the state of the view from our seats. It was pathetic !! It was like a store room right In front of us and the clustered counter and preparation table behind would make and NEA office come pounding on them. The food only deserved a maximum 2 star and could be probably be less as the price was astronomical and the Australian beef was disastrous. Another sad thing was that our chef at our table (they have 2) was so preoccupied with teaching a young assistant and did not even give eye contact or engage the customers right Infront of him. Isn't that the idea of having a seat at the replant ably table ?? Mr Takumi, where are you ?
4
Love the food there, service was good.
The food was fresh, price of the food could be on the high side.
4
I visited at the lunch time on Sunday and most of the seats are already reserved. I think the lunch set is very reasonable considering the taste. Fresh tuna here was very delicious.
4
This is a cozy restaurant in Keppel Bay. I have ordered set lunch, it came with dessert.
Only cost $15+ and taste excellent. Saba fish is fresh and nicely grilled, not too dried. Worth the try!
4
Ambience is good. Lunch promotion is value for money. Food is delicious. The one complaint is food served to the table is very slow. There were 4 of us but by the time the last person was served, the first person was already done with the food. And this was even after the first person waited awhile to begin eating. Do expect delays during lunch hours.    
3
had the pork teppanyaki set ($15 ++) , the pork had an overwhelmingly "pork-y" taste (not well handled), and it got cold so quickly i was basically eating plain pork stirfry after 10minschawan mushi that came as part of the set looks to be a half-portion (filling barely 1/3 of the cup) , disappointingice cream (part of the set) is only lychee-sized portionoverall, disappointing, i will not be coming againsurprisingly crowded at lunch time, go early or make a reservation, thought i wouldn't recommend going at all, i'd rather spend my money at an Ichiban outlet any da
4
Located in a remote place close to Vivo City. It is right next to the Marina Club in Keppel Bay. The sashimi & sushi are very fresh. They have a wide selection of sake as wellas food - teppanyaki, robatayaki, sashimi, sushi ....The sashimi sets are good value. Their omakase sets start from $150 but found them to be too much so we decided to pick from a la carte. The tiny Japanese yams are tasty. Had a grilled kinki fish which was perfectly done. The premium sake we had was excellent. Overall, it's a great Japanese experience
2
Been there with a group of six for a business dinner. This is a Japanese restaurant with some of the Japanese food twisted a bit to suit the Singaporean taste - which is a pity obviously. However, the fish is extremely fresh, extremely well selected, very tasty: whether it is the sashimi or the grilled fish. What spoiled our evening were (a) the too loud and bad pop music in the background, and (b) the very bad service. Extremely slow, rude (e.g. banging the glasses on the table after water refill), unpolite (no "good evening" at all), unprofessional and not well trained at all. SUMMARY: There are many Japanese restaurants in Singapore with food at least as good as here. And most have better service
1
I'm in Tokyo once a month - and when I read a review about a local (Singapore) Teppanyaki restaurant that's supposed to be good, I go. What a bad decision. Takumi Tokyo at Keppel Marina was nothing short of terrible. The service was non-existant. And the fact that some strange party consumed the entire staff for the evening, accompanied by a loop of Pharrell Williams 'Happy' - yes, maybe 40 times in a 3 hour period. Even when I complained about the pitiful situation after paying over S$200 for the most impossibly bad Japanese food we were offered a free sake. Takumi Tokyo? McDonalds Tokyo would be better
4
There were 6 of us and the food was great individually especially the grilled barracuda which surprisingly was a hit with my teenage kids. I would recommend this place for a quiet 2 person dinner with a mind to enjoy different variety of Japanese food. Seem a bit short handed on staff but overall was an enjoyable experience
4
Went for lunch and ordered the set. They have 3 main sets, mixed (tempura, sashimi, teppan, fried rice), chirashi set and steak set. All cost 30+ and tasted petty good. They have cheaper set like teriyaki don etc but didn't try. Fast service and good view of the marina
4
Very nice japanese restaurant in Singapore. The sashimi and sushi is very nice. The sushi rice from Nikaya, Japan.It's very very good.
4
Very nice Japanese restaurant. For value for money -- try the daily express set lunch. Available even on weekends. Good service and good food. Recommend to visit during the weekdays.
4
The food is good. Portions are generous. Great garlic fried rice. Beef is melt in your mouth perfect! Horrible music selection.
5
amazing place, great interaction with the chefs, service is v good and friendly, seafood couldn't get any fresher! absolutely loved it
4
This is a lovely experience - Keppel bay is fairly spectacular, day or night, and the restaurant matches the location. We had a great evening, with food and drinks nicely balanced. And of course watching robata and teppan as they happen is great fun. Takumi has a big selection of sake (not that we had a connoiseur in our midst), and our choices worked well with the food. Assorted appetisers and edamame worked well for a starter. Selection of sashimi was very fresh and tasty, deep fried tofu just the right consistency. Robata kinki fish was chosen for the name, and it just happened to be very tasty. Teppan oysters and teppan scallops were delicious, and desserts that followed pretty good (we had anmitsu). Not cheap, but a good experience
3
It's hidden in keppel island and tucked at a corner. There might be a crowd if it happens to be the day of a ship naming ceremony or some yacht event. But on other nights, the guests proportion fits snugly into the restaurant. Takumi has an open concept kitchen which surprisingly doesn't resonate the smell of food to the entire area. I tried the scallop simmered with tofu and it was really addictive, especially the gravy and texture.The wasabi is fresh and soft but a bit too light. So is the Ocha, a tad too bland and light. The pork teppan is good - juicy and tender, with accompanying sauce with a tinge of yuzu flavour. The miso soup is thick and rich with unique mushrooms in it. Overall, it's a pleasant, fuss-free dining experience
3
Despite the 50-50 not so good reviews I previously read, I still went to try out this restaurant. It is definitely a good location for restaurants since it has a view of the yachts that's if you go for the teppanyaki seatings. Sadly, their whole seating plan is not positioned to maximize the visual attraction that the restaurant has to offer. It is quite romantic considering not a lot of places in Singapore has a scenery like this. As for the food, nothing really pops out in fact I should say it's overpriced since the taste or the quality of the food didn't stand out much
3
Had dinner there recently. Food is good but the service level dropped a lot. The service staff don't know the dishes they are serving. They poured so much soy sauce into our sauce plate, a good Japanese restaurant staff will not do such thing, you are not supposed to dip your sushi with so much soy sauce. I ordered a desert and it was served totally different from the picture in the menu. The picture shows creambrulee with some fresh strawberries and raspberries on the side. The desert was served with a strawberry in the creambrulee. When I asked the staff, they brought the menu and pointed at small prints in the menu said "we stated in our menu the pictures are for illustration only and it may differ". What type of service is this. I don't think I want go back to this restaurant unless they improve their service level and attitude
4
My colleagues brought me there for my farewell lunch. The restaurant is tucked in a hidden corner but love the ambience. Ordered the Masa zu set at $35, really worth it cos a large variety but their express lunch sets at $15 has a wide variety too. Would recommend to try the Ginger pork set
4
First time there.. Surprised by the warmth and coziness of the place. Excellent service with everyone smiling and willing to please. The food was good if not spectacular. I especially liked the grilled cheese and also the beef. Sashimi was fresh and nicely presented but I have had better. Overall, I would come again - as its a great place (and quiet) to catch up with friends. Pricing was reasonable
