The Pandan Leaf Wrapped Chicken was really good, and the Tom Yum Soup really gives one the "kick". Most of the other dishes were alright.
4
The restaurant is super cheap and offers really good food to share, the only complain would be that it is a very casual place so it is is maybe not the best place to take someone if you want to impress them :)

It is an authentic Thai restaurant located in little Thai place in Singapore called Golden Mile. Foods are delicious and tasty as actual Thai food.
5
The place is packed at peak hours. But the food is as authentic as the ones I get in Thailand. The tomyum soup is spicy and flavourful with lots of mushrooms and seafood in it. The omelette Phat thai is my favorite amongst the food I ordered. The curry pork is tasty too. I do feel the warmth from the service crew.

My first time to Diandin Leluk because my friends recommended! It’s spacious and the service staffs are very attentive and friendly! Ordered clear tom yum soup, green curry, bbq fish, fiskcake, olive fried rice, seafood fried rice, fried vegetable, and thai ice milk tea! Yummy food, good service, and reasonable price. Highly recommended and I’ll be back here next time agai

It’s very interesting that a number of reviewers have mentioned the expensiveness of this eatery. I thought that when I first looked at the menu, but after ordering (and eating) I’m not sure I agree now. Really, for the quality and quantity of food, I thought we got a great deal. There were two of us, and for three dishes and a big beer, the total bill was S$27. And we asked for a doggie bag as we couldn’t finish all the food. We had a noodle soup (beef) that was nothing special, but the Phat Thai Omelette was to die for. And the wok hei on the Green Chicken Curry Fried Rice was sublime. This is not the most amazing meal you will ever have in Singapore, but it is well worth a visit

My first time to this restaurant. Tom Yum soup was real spicy but with lots of ingredients in a small little pot for 2 persons - yummy. We also ordered Phai Thai and Stir-Fry Minced Pork with Thai Basil which was ok. Plenty of seats available and suspect all their staffs are Thai. Opens 24 hours and accept credit cards
3
I have eaten here 2 or 3 times. The food is always tasty. Tom Yum soup is among the best I ever tasted. But the prices are quite high relative to other Thai places in Singapore. I will probably eat here again despite the price and slow service. On the service, I had to ask for the same thing 2-3x (for several items)...

We celebrated Mother's Day as my mum is a big fan of Thai food. 2 years back, we had our gathering dinner here which was good (as far as I could remember).This time round, we order similar dishes plus new ones. Turns out it's not up to our expectation and the taste seems to be on the more salty side. We order tom yum soup, bee Hoon crab, stuffed chicken wings, black pepper pork, bean paste Kang kong, prawn cake, mixed vegetable. The tom yum soup was ok. the bee Hoon crab, bee Hoon too soggy and it's very salty to taste. Hard to eat without adding white rice.Stuffed chicken wings, the stuffing is very dry. There is no dip except Chili sauce. Can you imagine even young kids stay away from this dish as they find it hard to swallow. Black pepper pork, the picture seems to show bbq style but turns out it's very deep fry style. It's deep fried till dark brown. Not very healthy & its dry plus tough.Bean paste Kang kong is good, fresh gege and surprisingly good too. Prawn cake, the serving is big and kids love this dish. It's softer than the usual fish cake we have for Asian dish. They provide a sour dip that goes well with the prawn cake.The adults like the mixed vegetables, same comments: its fresh and crunchy.Overall, I'm not likely to go there again as it's not a fulfilling meal and the price is not cheap.The crab cost $40 per dish. (No seasonal pricing

Dishes seem to be loosing it's authenticity. Prices are more expensive. Food taste is OK but wasn't great!

This is as authentic as it gets for Thai street food outside Thailand. Worth the stroll into the Golden Mile complex.

My grandma is a Thai Chinese and I visit Bangkok at least 4 times a year. I have been visiting this place for about 2 years; it's a weekly affair to dine in. I have tried all the food served in the restaurant previously before the change of new Menu. The Thai milk tea is a MUST drink whereas green milk tea is average. Mango salad has a good dressing which is a wee bit sweet spicy. The Tom yum soup used to be quite flavorful with lots of ingredients. It tasted Thai authentic. However during the recent visit, something taste not correct. It lacks a punch or we can taste the mix of the paste. The oyster omelette used to be very fragrant with big and juicy oyster and fresh bean sprout. However likewise during the recent visit on a Saturday night, it's small and dry. Not much taste and there is a lot of flour added; so much that we can taste the flour. The curry chicken and other chicken dishes as well as rice and noodles, saw a dip in the flavoring and authenticity. I am not sure if there is a Change in chef because the dishes are quite mediocre. Not worth shouting about. The durian and mango sticky rice, the rice is very cold and hard; making it difficult to swallow.

Hi everybody yes it's another Thai food Ok so let's start with the place. It's had above environmental Great from family gathering. Dinner and lunch ? No problem The Thai Milk tea is great,I had the phad thai and their tom yam soup u should try it.  They are abit pricey but good portions. Service is not ba

I just ate there with a friend. While I enjoyed eating there in the past, gradually the quality and standard is dropping. It's not my usual style of complaining against a restaurant but 3 hours ago I patronized the restaurant and now I am having the runs. The pandas chicken tasted good, the stuffed chicken wings were nice too, However the Tom Ka Gai the chicken smells and the Tom Yum Kong the prawns were meshy and so were the squid. That means they were not fresh or worse gen bad. I am having diarrhea now
5
All the local Thai's in Singapore eat here and for very good reason. Open all hours we went late one night with a group of 10. We ordered a range of dishes to share and all were delicious! The dishes were also spicy! Trust me when I say Thai spicy is much hotter than your usual spicy and I can eat hot food usually. The area itself in the centre isn't that nice and there a some strange smells but if you can get past that the food is delicious and the service was good
3
Pineapple rice was disappointing. It is bland, with a few pieces of tasteless chicken bits. The thai sliced sausage on top of the rice is not nice either. I order extra sunny side up so I could eat with the pineapple rice as it is tasteless. Not ordering that anymore
5
We went there once for lunch and then went there for almost everyday for the next week or so.. Best phat Thai and Thai fried rice ever! Tried a lot of dishes and green curry is the best I ever tried! The exterior may not be the best or inviting.. But once you start eating you will forget everything else..
4
Was honestly looking for Abb Zabb's lobster tom yum, but couldn't find it anywhere. Was so hungry we popped in here, and was not disappointed one bit.That kway teow was the real deal. Chewy noodles perfectly seasoned with plump prawns and crispy greens. The papaya salad too was refreshing. Crab fried rice was so good with a distinct wok cooked taste and plenty of crab. Minus one star for weird iced tea.You can choose what size you want for most items. All for around 20$US

Read the mixed reviews and having not tried the Thai food eateries at Golden Mile before, we decided we had to. The place is really like Bangkok ice you step out of your car in the car park. And the Thai music playing with the smells and Thai shops makes it really like another realm in Singapore. The restaurant is the largest here. The service is fast and we ordered too much for 2 persons. The portions are huge. The Tom Yam soup and Kang Kong is good. But the rest of the food like pineapple rice , cashew chicken and oyster omelette is really disappointing. The pineapple rice was cold and lumpy. And the other 2 items were just warm and rather tasteless. I won't recommend these dishes. And the prices are not cheap for what it's worth. For me, Nakhon wins in terms of taste and freshness for the similarity in price.

Run by Thais who serve authentic Thai food. Great value for a handy portion of meals. Large variety of dishes.
3
Not the easiest to locate in an old shopping mall, this eatery serves reasonably authentic Thai food if you can navigate through the many Thai provision shops and weekend crowds in the mall to get there.
5
If you're in the area and are craving great Thai, this is the place to go. Everything from noodles, tom yum, fish and mango sticky rice is delicious!
5
Really nice staff. There was a small mistake with my order but they promptly corrected it. Very nice n polite.
4
Been here for an after work snack. Well the whole place feels like Phuket in a mall.... But the food is nice actually. Seems fresh an well prepared.

This place is in the heart of Singapore's little Thailand - the Golden Mil Complex, and unsurprisingly serves uncompromisingly good Thai food. Particularly memorable are the Prawn Balls, the Mango and Papaya Salads, All colours of curry (I especially like the Red/Yellow and Masaman when available) thous i find there Tom Yum a little too powerful for my palate. I love the spiced mussels and other seafood dishes - basically everything. Their Olive Rice is a treat in itself, with its nuts and real lemons too...One of the best eateries in Singapore (if you can stand parking in the filthy car park that is...and avoid the extremely insanitary toilets
2
After 3 years I was going back and was very disappointed at the food taste and spice level...The Tom Yum wasn't spicy as it is usually is, the vegetable was very oily. Perhaps it was a wrong choice of vege!!!But the Tom yum was really off. As an avid traveller who loves Thai food, I would know the difference in food tast

Along with our Australian friends, my wife and I enjoyed a scrumptious Thai meal last Thursday night at this restaurant in the Golden Mile Complex. Parking underneath the businesses made it easy to get to and the food was full of rich flavours. Needless to say, we all over ate.The restaurant operates with the customers filling in the chit with the dishes they want and then the waiter/waitress collecting the chit. Our whole group was particularly hungry so we ordered large of everything. When the waitress came to collect our order, she went through each item and suggested the portions we would need. Everything was reduced down to Medium or Small. Pretty impressive service you'd have to say. Also, the beer here was very reasonably priced - a 500 ml Singha beer for $8!Anyway, onto the food. We enjoyed a range of dishes from Fishcakes, Stir-fried Brocolli with Oyster Sauce & Prawn, Dou Meow with Oyster Sauce, Braised Prawn with Dry Curry, Phat Thai, Stir Fired Minced Chicken with Basil Leaves and Chilli, Thai style Fried Rice with seafood and we shared a couple of desserts. The flavours were outstanding and the service great. The total bill came to $134 for the four of us, very reasonable indeed

Went with a friend for having a lunch pork noodle soup. Being married to a Thai for many years I do say I know a lot of various type of good noodle soup...and this one was not in that category. I believe the soup base is of water and flavor cubes instead of proper boiled pork soup base. The meat was very much inder par and more of a fat tissue than pork meat suitable for consumption...my advise: go to another smaller restaurant...this place do not know how to make a noodle soup

Located in a massive Thai style shopping complex selling everything from travel tour packages to mani-pedis or vegetables and fish. The resto is basic with plastic chairs and foldable tables. But the service is prompt and regular. Some frowny staff aside, most people were friendly and happy to help. The portions were huge!! And the food delicious! Massive upside - every dish can be made vegetarian!
5
Ask for less spice, very spicy. And must try the garoupa fried fish with sweet and sour sauce. The best Thai food in Singapore, some Thai friends say it's better than their Thai ones.
4
one of the best thai restaurants in the city. the pricing is a bit on the higher side but rest assured its quality thai food. have dined several times and you will not be disappointed.,
even their desserts on offer are very good.Must try!!
5
Introduced to this place by family who live here. Everything you would expect of a Thai restaurant. Food was well cooked and service was fast. Green curry was fabulous as was the Pad Thai, but all the dishes were bursting with flavour,
3
Good value for money considering portion size. We took individual size crabmeat fried rice, omelette pad thai, crabmeat rolls, mango sticky rice, lemongrass drink & Thai coconut. We had to takeaway half pad thai & fried rice as it was quite a lot. And our bill was just around $35 for all this.Now actual food :Crabmeat Rolls - 4.5/5Crabmeat Fried Rice - 3/5Pad Thai - 3/5Mango Sticky Rice - 3/5The seafood is fresh. The fried rice, on plus side, used fresh crab meat & on minus side, lacks the overall flavour punch. Pad Thai is average & so is Mango Sticky Rice. Service is courteous & efficient
5
Came here because we miss the authentic delicious thai food but we can only afford to travel to singapore and not to Bangkok. But we were not disappointed at all. they gave serve us some delicious meal and we were happy with our dinner. It's pretty easy to find the restaurant once you arrived in the Golden Mile Complex. I think everyone there knows where is Diadin Leluk. would definitely come back when we're in singapore. THANK YOU!:
4
This was the main reason I went to Golden Mile Complex. Thai Red Rubies! Water chestnuts cut into chunky cubes and coated with tapioca flour and dyed red. Served with coconut cream. Satisfied my craving and made my day! The other dessert I got was the Thai Mango with sticky rice. With a side of coconut cream, which you drizzle over the mango before tucking in. Mango was sweet. Got this from Golden Mile Complex - Diandin Leluk Thai Restaurant, which has a dessert takeaway counter! Many Thai desserts to choose from

Decent food, reasonable value but slooooow service – asked three times why a Thai restaurant took so long to serve Tom Yam soup and was not given a comprehensible explanation or even an apology. Shabby, run down place. As former reviewers indicate it is not 5 star but I expect the courtesy of an apology in such circumstances – better service from a food ct … looks like service has deteriorated recently - perhaps they should be less complacent – this customer, for one, will not return when there are so many other options in the Golden Mile Complex
4
Tom Yum is the dish I am impressed most. I find its nicer than what I tried in Thailand. The taste is strong, spicy and sour and thick soup. It goes well with hot rice. I went there with my Japanese and she love it very much. People who come here is for Thai authentic food, not for 5 stars service or fine dinning ambience. Price is reasonable. I go there whenever I have craving for Thai food

My brother decide to bring his Father In Law here to have dinner. This famous Thai eatery at Golden Mile Complex also known as Little Thailand in Singapore. This casual eatery always bustling & exciting with activities. We had Mango Salad, which the FIL likes, Tomyam soup, Pineapple rice, Fried fish, fried kangkong, Tang Hoon Salad etc. overall the food is okay, cos its Father's Day, so the food was served very fast and it turns cold fast too. Cannot really sit to enjoy the food & occasion. Is like rushing us to faster eat & go cos many guest queuing for tables

Located in the Golden Mille Complex, it was quite easy to find this place since it's in front of the bus station and I just had my dinner there. Me and my friends found about Diandin Leluk from Ladyironchef blog, we try to find delish food near to Lavender street because we stayed in that area. After we arrived, the restaurant was not too 'beautiful' but all the tables were full! That must be something! I order Pad Thai, and my friend order Kwey Tiaow. For drinks, I choose Ice Tea (which they served it as Thai Tea), and my friend choose Ice Milo haha. Not long enough until the food were on our table. We can even smell the scent of fresh seafood and a bit spicy aroma. IT WAS DELICIOUS! I feel like I'm in Bangkok already! The shrimps were fresh, and the ingredients was just perfect for my taste buds. I am definitely recommend you guys who craving for Thai food in Singapore. And they open 24 hours! It cost only 6 SGD for Pad Thai (individual) and only 1,80 SGD for Ice Tea. Worth the value
5
Located in the Golden Mile mall, it has NO atmosphere (yay!) and great food. Super cheap and filled with Thai people, so always a good sign. Don't be put off by the looks of the place.

My favourite joint to visit whenever I have a craving for Thai comfort food, especially a good bowl of beef noodles with loads of chili flakes and a packet (separate purchase at about $1.50-$3/bag) of crispy pig skin. They recently increased the price of their dishes and a small bowl of noodles now costs $5. Another dish that I like is also the clear tom yum soup, which is not often seen on menus. Not the cheapest restaurant around, but for the quality of food I have nothing much to complain about
5
Inside a chaotic mall in Singapore, it serves sumptuous Thai food...Start with the staple coconut water, and sticky rice (literally sticky) and green/red curry.The Phad Thai noodles are a must order...delicious absolutely....Non-spicy tasters please mention so at the time of ordering. Easy on the pocket too...

Four of us at dined 2 weeks ago. We had eaten here about a year ago and remembered that the food was authentically Thai. I don't know what has happened in the past year, but the food and service were abysmal. The papaya salad was not pounded in the least, just very coarse shreds, and with no or few dried prawns, a few peanuts and tomatoes. The pad thai seemed reheated - not freshly made. A spicy dip served with vegetables and fried fish was tasty, but the vegetables were cooked - odd for a Thai dish. The chicken with cashew stir fry was more Chinese than Thai, with no punch of fresh herbs. Sadly, the sticky rice with mango was also disappointing - again it tasted old. The service was unattentive, except for pouring and offering beer. We had called to make a reservation earlier in the day and were told there would be no problem with four people at 7 PM. When we arrived, the staff refused to seat us at a good table with comfortable seats but put us at the back of the restaurant next to the drinks refrigerators and sink, on old hard chairs. The restaurant was 1/2 empty, so this was surprising. Needless to say, but we won't be going back

I have been here many times but hadn't visited in a bout 1 year and last weekend went back.To say it has gone downhill is putting it mildlyThe food was abysmal. the service poor.One order didn't get delivered and they argued that we had had it (and hidden the plate presumably!).The lemongrass chicken was in fact bones in grease. The oyster omelette was poor and tasted dreadful with cheapo canned oysters.The "smelly" beans were not cooked and were rock hardAll in all grim. Complaining to staff was a waste of time they are totally disinterestedWont be going bac

This is "the place" to go to if one is looking for authentic Thai in Singapore. I have been to this place many times and it never disappoints in any way. Lunch or dinner, its always crowded and the food remains the same. I have probably ordered almost everything they have on the menu but can not comment on whats better as everything I had was the best. They even accomodate requests for making any dish Vegetarian which is a plus and only shows their flexibility vis a vis other Thai outlets. Located in Little Thailand, this place is probably the only one where one can even host visitors as it is more decently organised and systematic.

One Weekend we went shopping at the Thai Supermarket on the 2nd floor, and decide to eat at Duandin Leluk which was just below the supermart. It was a very bad decission. Experience the worst service ever! We have ordered way ahead of the later customers who came, but was served the last. Not only that the Tom Yum soup came with less than 3 ingredients - what I found were swimming with lemon grass, chillies and other herbs.. only bits of tiny sqiud meat, 1 miserable prawn and a few mushrooms.. and the rest was history.. the price of the miserable tom yum cost at least MORE than $12!!! WIth $12, i could have eaten somewhere better and have better service. I mentioned to the cashier that there was nothing impressive in the Tom Yum, and she just shrugged it off.. that was the worst restaurant ever! I hope they will close shop soon

Whenever i and my colleagues are craving for Thai food, we wil go to the Golden Miles complex which is known as "little thai" in Singapore. There are few of Thai restaurant, but for me, I prefer Diandin leluk.The place is quite clean, the food is nice ( no meaty smell like some other restaurant), and it is affordable. All the foods are quite original. I heard, the owner who is a Singaporean was married to a Thai. Though the foods are nice, i don't really quite like the drinks there, as those drinks are too sweet for me. Usually, i just let the ice melted so it will dilute the overly sweet drink they served
1
We went looking for authentic Thai foods and present dinning experience. What we found are terrible foods and bad service (bad taste, cheap ingredients, precook dishes, reheat dishes, "very" overcook meats/seafoods, not fresh and dirty/messy restaurant). then to top it all off the bill arrived with so many errors ( dishes we did not order, the ordered dish was multiple 2 instead of one, prices were enter wrongly). It's pure luck one of us checked the bill. Wooow, this is a tourist trap. The junior waiter was surprising calm (use to it?) and casually adjust the bill on the spot!. We quickly walk away and put it as lesson learnt.
5
Love the food here. Service was good too. Surrounding "mall" not that great, but this place has some of the best Thai food outside of Thailand I have ever tasted. To be sure, it is not fancy or sophisticated dining and the decor just is, but of you are in the mood for some really good Thai food, look no further. We had Clear Tom Yam Soup, Fishcakes, Papaya Salad, Stir Fried Morning Glory, Spicy Steamed Seabass, and steamed rice. It was all delicious, but my favorite was the Clear Tom Yum soup (quite spicy). The Stir Fried Morning Glory and the Papaya salad are a must too. The Thai Iced Tea is quite good if you like that - almost as good as the stuff you drink out of a plastic bag in Bangkok. Made me really miss the fantastic street food you take for granted when in Thailand....Will likely become a regular here at Diandin Leluk.

I visited for dinner at Diandin Leluk resto. The food were good and inexpensive. But the complex is not fun
4
We had a very good meal here with strong spice levels. The soup and the green curry were very good though the phat Thai was very average. Recommended
1
I was looking to impress my guest with some authentic Thai food and experience and we chose to go to Diandin Leluk. Food arrived quickly, a bit too quickly and they were lukewarm or at room temperature. The prawn stir fry with asparagus smelled not so fresh, fish cake unexceptional, pad thai had minimal ingredients and the chicken in the tom khai ghai was simply not good. And we had a visitor, a cockcroach crawling on the table

Diandin Leluk has the reputation of serving the best, authentic Thai food in Singapore – a distinction that I felt I had to explore for myself. I was pleasantly surprised.Food The food easily compared to the real deal served in restaurants in Thailand. The Tom Yam Goong was piping hot, spicy, tangy and mouth-wateringly delicious. I could barely stop eating it in order to do justice to the rest of the food we’d ordered. The garupa was fresh and flavourful as was the rice and papaya salad. Staff & ServiceThe Thai staff was polite but slightly inattentive. Getting a waitress’s attention could prove something of a task. We didn't have to wait very long for our food to arrive.Ambiance & LocationGolden Mile complex, in Singapore’s Little Thailand, isn't the best of locations – it is pokey, noisy and dingy. The ambiance of the restaurant itself is lousy. There are cheap tables and chairs carelessly laid out. You could find yourself dining out in the corridor of the building on a busy night. Value for MoneyThis place serves up some great food that is good value for money. The portions are quite generous.Tips for DinersMake a reservation as this place is very popular and crowded. Avoid looking into their kitchen if you’re finicky about hygiene and don’t expect prompt service. Don’t miss the Tom Yam Goong.Overall ImpressionThe food here would far outclass any fancy Thai restaurants in more upmarket areas of town

You will not find this restaurant just passing by. It is located inside of a "mall". Once inside the mall you will think you are in Thailand - there are a only Thai shops. Be aware it smells badly.The restaurant is somewhat clean and the staff is really friendly. The food was great! We went there for lunch. The toilet paper instead of napkins takes gettting used to. On the other hand, you usually do not even get any napkins in cheaper restaurants in Singapore, so this was a step forward

We stopped at the Diandin Leluk Thai Rstnt Pte Ltd (Thai restaurant) at the Golden Mile Complex on Beach Road while waiting to catch our bus to Malaysia. This was the only place open early in the morning which was nice as we like a cuppa before heading out on bus trips. Very nice lady served us up two morning coffees and two pork buns that made a decent and light breakfast prior to our bus trip. Coffees were SD$1.50 and the pork buns SD$1.20 each, nothing fantastic, just decent filling food and drinks that didn't cost much, prior to our trip. Would have no problem making a quick stop here again before bus trips out of Singapore
5
I ate dinner with family friends in the restaurant. The Yam Woosen and Mango salad were excellent. The steam fish was subtle and good. The spring roll vermicelli was good. The vegetable was good. Everything was good. Recommended to budget traveller. The only note was the complex is not good since it mixed with meat market so it smells. The restaurant itself relatively clean and not smells but I still love it

Tip 1: This joint has two shops and they run separately by the category of their food. The one with lots of sweets laying outside the shop sells Thai desserts and the other shop next to it sells savoury dishes to customer.Tip 2: Pretty much everything on their menu are overpriced and three times more expensive then the price in Bangkok. Tip 3: Although they are overpriced, i think it is a good place for people to come and have a good meal if they are desperately missing good Thai food.Tip 4: The sight of thai ladies sitting in the corner packing tonnes and tonnes of deep fried pork crackling makes you want to try it so do try it because it taste exactly the same as those you bought in Bangkok!Tip 5: We ordered a pineapple rice, papaya salad, sambal kangkong and etc and the bill came up to about SGD$56, you can see that it is not as cheap as it should be so make sure you bring enough cash. See picture.Tip 6: Overall i will recommend my friends to come here but wouldnt come here all the time because its way too pricey to have thai food in Singapore.If you think my reviews have been helpful to you, please click 'Yes' for 'Was this review helpful?

Being located in Little Thailand, one is not surprised to get authentic thai fare at this unassuming outlet.Starting from a little shop near the entrance of the building, Diandin Leluk has grown to a restaurant occupying several shop spaces and having branches elsewhere.With the majority of the staff being thai, one can say the experience is almost like being in thailand.The food served is a mixture of thai food and thai-teochew food. Do remember to tell them not too spicy if you are not able to tolerate hot stuff. Some of the dishes can be so spicy it makes a grown man cry

I agree with the reviewer who said that this is pretty close to Thai food from Thailand.Food is by and large pretty good so long as they dont attempt the give the recipes a local Singapore taste, this entirely spoils the flavour.Service can be very patchy and its quite hard work to get drinks topped up and or order more food.the steamed fish is good and tastes very Thai. The Salted fish fried rice is a bit lacking but ok.The veggies are often overcooked and soggyAll in all o
