Bubble tea craze might be over, but there are still people queuing over this store. You are able to choose the sweetness and ice level for the health consciousness type. Or just go for the full taste and be blown away by it.

Koi has alot of outlets in singapore, selling varieties of bubble tea.You can choose the sugar level, big or medium size drinks. Their must try drink would be green Tea macchiato, bubble milk tea and ovaltine. You also can choose with or without ice. A must drink!!
