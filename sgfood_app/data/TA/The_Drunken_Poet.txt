Came with a friend and was served promptly! Service was good but food was even better. The portion was large (I could barely finish it). The meal was very greasy though.

Nothing really all that spectacular. Just a boring Irish bar, and the location is a bit of a concern as well.

Could be so much better. Disinterested staff. Poor food choices. Empty while other places nearby are chockablock.

Stumbled upon this place by chance while looking for a pub to watch a football match. Didn’t notice it at first as the exterior wasn’t too obvious but inside it is a cosy little pub. Ordered Poet Platter, Classic Bangers & Mash as well as Truffle Fries. Both the platter & Bangers & Mash were pretty tasty, and the portion was just nice. However the truffle fries wasn’t the best we’ve tried as it was quite dry. Would like to commend on the service though, as the servers were quite attentive.

I think this is just a little cool sports bar. Nothing fanciful but decent for a few drinks to hang out at Orchard. You can be "entertained" if you sit at the window by all the actions outside Orchard Towers, besides watching your favorite soccer match on the screens. Service is fine and believe it or not, my family actually ended up there on New Year's Eve to have a couple of drinks and catching up! It is one of my husband's regular haunt since he likes to have a few drinks before dinner.May be they can improve their truffle fries

Stopped in for a quick drink or two in this noisy Irish place near the Hilton.Ignore the drunk men who swear every other word...just adds a different character to it all. LoL.Had to try the Shepherd's pie as it is a long time favorite when done well. Have to remember to ask for "no cheese" toppings as it takes away from the meat taste when the amount of cheese exceeds the amount of mashed potato. Was an enjoyable dish with a few heaping splashes of tabasco! AC was blowing as hard as the windy city

I was staying at the Hilton directly across Orchard Road but was doing a bit of walking in the heat and humidity of a lazy Sunday afternoon. I remembered the Concierge telling me there is an Irish Pub across the road so I figured what the heck, I'm in desperate need of liquid refreshment and strong air conditioning. On those two points this place is perfectly fine. How do you mess up an Irish Pub for crying out loud??It is a small, dark place and I sat at the bar. Rugby and football were on the tvs, along with schedules for both sports. The male bartender had zero personality and was frankly more interested in talking to the waiter working the tables. He also kept splashing my phone and glasses that were sitting on the bar while he was making drinks. Frankly, it was annoying. The food menu was not large, but the place isn't either. In addition the food I saw come by didn't "wow" me. After I had 2 gin & tonics I was glad to leave. I used the bathroom on the way out & it could be MUCH cleaner! There is a larger & much better Irish place around the corner about a 3 minute walk away (see my review)...I suggest you go there for a fantastic Irish Pub experience.

I was very much looking forward to visiting this pub, after visiting similar establishments all over the world, and reading previous reviews. However it saddens me to say that the Guinness was foul-tasting, and my wife's Heineken tasted very strange too !I don't think I will be returning here

This is a fun spot for some pub grub and a cold brew. The staff is attentive, and there is always a soccer game on the TV. The beer is served very cold. The food is standard pub fare. It is located right on Orchard, so it is walking distance to most of the Orchard Hotels

It's right on Orchard road and a nice glass frontage to view the world go by and have a cold one. Plus they show live sports like the EPl and rugby and such. It's the best Irish bar in Singapore because its got food, booze, sports and a great location.

Traditional Irish pub fare and cold beer. I thought the Irish stew was very good, and plan to try the shepherd's pie when I go back. Service was good. What more do you want?

Very Nice pub and staff are extremely friendly and welcoming. The cost of drinks are high but same as anywhere in Singapore.

If you are seeking a sports fix to watch your footy team while in Singapore or a good pub with friendly service, pub meals and an Irish feel than drop in and enjoy.

It's a nice pub and the drinks are excellent. However we tried the burgers and were very disappointment. Maybe we just picked a bad day and this was leftover meat. Shall not return.

New bar by Orchard Towers, good sports, choice of beers, food not great but reasonable pub food, sit in a window seat and watch the world go by( and plenty of other things!!!)

After 3 days searching - found a pub where the price of drinks was reasonably priced - a pint of Heineken for $12.40, by Singapore standards reasonable! TV shows the current sporting action (no volume) watched Murray lose in the Aussie Open - there looks to be a good menu too, again reasonably priced. Delightful local girls will look after you. We will return tomorrow and eat before we fly on to Australia. The pub is just a spit away from Orchard Gateway and Somerset on the rail line connection

Nice little bar tucked away in Orchard Towers that could be easily missed if not for the keen eye. Location: 4/5Ambience: 4.5/5 (Great for Soccer Matches)Cleanliness: 5/5Quality of Food: 4.5/5Customer Service: 3/5Our Orders:Guinness Beef Stew: 4/5Shepherd's Pie: 3/5Chef's Pork Rib: 4/5Pizza Truffle: 3.5/5Strawberry Cooler: 3/5The Good: Nice, chilly atmosphere, not much people coming on Saturday evening, great place to chill over beer and finger food! And awesome place to watch a Soccer match! The Bad: Customer service can be better, the turnaround timing can be faster. Bottom Line: Great place to visit for guy's nights out, we love the booze and meat dishes, place is just cozy and lovely, and fantastic for El Classicos!

Located next door to the infamous Orchard Towers aka Four Floors...., this is a nice little indoor pub that shows all of the major sporting events on a number of TV screens. One of the TVs is in a small area that looks down onto the busy street so you get two doses of entertainment at the same time!The service was excellent both times I visited and the prices were reasonable by Singapore standards

Nice, chill pub slightly off from the main Orchard stretch. Simple atmosphere with a good blend of rock to complement your evening pint. Several tables offer a good view for people watching if that's your thing. TV for sports available for you ardent fans. Drinks were decently priced at ~$15+ a pint. Didn't care for the Irish Meatballs, but Fried Button Mushrooms and Onion Rings did not disappoint. Attentive staff who don't hover as you're finishing your drink (always a plus!). Will be back with friends for sure.

After being ripped off to the tune of $55SGD for 2 pints of beer at the Marriott cafe, to find this pub that gave great service, great beer, and good pub snacks just up the road was fantastic.We went back several times, as to sit and watch the street theatre with a good beer was just so entertaining, especially on the Sunday afternoon when some of the ladies of negotiable affection were walking along Orchard Road past the pub. It was hilarious
