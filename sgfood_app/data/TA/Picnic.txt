This restaurant (inside a shopping mall) is a food hall with various selections of different restaurants and one bar. The selection is rather limited but if your sick of walking around the centre this was a fun place to find.
3
New restaurants pop up at Wisma Atria and went to try the food. You get a token and ordered directly from the stall, similar to Marchie concept. The isn't much selection when compared to Marchie. Food wise is also average for my taste.

Stumbled upon picnic one day and had enjoyed omakase burger and beef bulgogi tacos. Its a good place to meet up with friends without having to worry about who is paying or splitting the bill.
Food, service and ambience was great!

I visited with friends, family and children which worked out to be great. With the food truck type concept with many options for food and beverages I am sure that everyone would be able to find something for themselves. During our visit the kids had pizza and pasta and l tried the Hamburger. Would have liked to try other items but did not have time to head back during my trip, will go back the next time I am in Singapore to give it another go. Overall if your out shopping and would like a good place which is a little different from the typical food hall then this might be the place for you

All I ordered was a mascarpone crepe with strawberries and pistachio. Strangely, even though the crepe was freshly prepared, it came cold. I was also under the impression that the crepe came filled with mascaporne cheese when in fact, it was only drizzled on the crepe. And come to think of it, it tasted very much like yoghurt. Was it mascaporne? Everythibg was so average, so flat and so devoid of heartiness and flavour, you wish you hadn't ordered anything in the first place

Like Marche, it's self service at Picnic where you order food from different stalls serving Asian, American and European food.The butadon from the Jap stall is delectable; only grouse is 30% of the grilled marinated pork is actually pure fat! Not healthy at all, plus you'd paid for something which you shouldn't eat :(Expect wallet damage of at least $20 for just a simple meal. Other affordable eating places in Orchard Road beckons, I must say
3
I came here only because I heard that Omakase Burger moved here.When you reach the door, you're asked if you're staying to eat or just passing through. If you're staying to eat, you get a device that the cashiers can scan when you place your order. It also buzzes when your food is ready. You scan your device at the self checkout to pay before leaving. If you're just passing through, you get a little pass so that you can browse around.Frankly, I'm not sure if I'll come back
3
For first timers and foreigners it can be very confusing. Your orders are put on a buzzer like what is used at your local club or pub. The pictures show large burgers but mine had shrunk by the time i received it. Chicken was good and so was Tai dishes. Burgers were a rip-off

Popped Picnic out of curiosity after dinner for desserts and tried some cakes and pies. Nothing stood out though it’s clear the winner at the joint was either Omakase Burger or the Taiwanese beef rice bowl. We had pumpkin cake which was the only choice that stood out. The Apple pie came neither warm Nor cold. The lime tart was - you didn’t miss anything not having it.

1. Ambience is nice but water is not provided.2. Selection of food item is limited per stall3. Korean stall, Japanese stall, Italian stall, Taiwanese stall, pizza stall, burger stall, drinks stall, dessert stall etc4. No service charge but per meal is priced at $10 or more per serving. Can of soft drinks is priced at $3.905. Self service and self check-out Overall, similar dining experience as marche. Not recommended for those Budget diners.Trust this helps.

W#e are vegetarians and got some options, inc the best Rosti in Singapore. Marche is where we went to previously for Rosti, but its not been good the past few times, so tried picnic and loved it here. Nice and crispy. Like the concept of self ordering and different stations inside, like the italian one where the pizza was so crispy and nic

~stumbled upon another Marche wannabe with a very Asian influence (2016Nov)~the buzzer system takes some getting used to but was easy to learn~food is cooked to order and comes fresh mostly~a novelty like the many before it... not as personable as an actual food court but courtish without the personalit

Heard about this place and decided to visit today with family of 4 for lunch. Reached around noon time, small que at the entrance but we were ushered to our table pretty quickly. Each of us were given an electronic tag to be used for the ordering of food. Stalls selections include Taiwanese, Korean, Japanese rice (no sushi ),pizza, spaghetti (very good), roast, lots of desserts, juice, coffee...Food is generally good. Highly Recommended for a different dining experience.

This ‘Western’ food-court type restaurant was a pleasant surprise behind the big mysterious signage which I passed by so many times on the way to the up-stairs hawker’s food court, DTF and Starbucks. During our last week we decided to give it a try and see what it had to offer. Inside there are plenty of stalls with all sorts of food from burgers and fries, to pizza, pies and ice-cream and chicken. The concept is you are given a buzzer and place your order and then collect. I had a cheese burger, fries and root-beer whist my friend had a salad and some chicken. The portions were good and the fare was to be expected…deliciously greasy burgers and fries. The prices and combo deals are reasonable and the service was really fast. There is so much lovely food in Singapore that I would save this for when you have a craving for your local diner…but it did not disappoint. I agree with the other reviewers though that this is not a place to visit more than once

Pretty place decorated with flowers and plants. Stalls selling burger, rosti, pizza, taiwanese food, drinks, desserts and more. The buzzer given would also record the food you have ordered. It was easy to order food at the machines and pay on the way out. Would be better if the stalls are spread out and more variety available.
5
It's a communal dining restaurant with 13 food trucks including Italian, Japanese, Korean and Burgers. The decor is a garden with picnic tables, plants and grass. There's a Foosball table and arcade games to keep the kids happy. You order your own food at the trucks using your buzzer and pay when you leave. The Omakase burgers here are great although a bit small so if you are hungry get the double. Have also had the aglio olio which is really tasty with plenty of prawns, squid rings and mussels. Nice selection of cakes, ice cream and crepes to choose from to finish your meal. Great place for lunch and will definitely go again

Stumbled upon Picnic at Wisma Atria and it looked interesting so we had lunch there. The concept is you buy your lunch from one of the food outlets/trucks then sit at this "park" like you're having a picnic. The place was decently decorated and there we sufficient seats for everyone. Food-wise I didn't think there was a huge variety to choose from and I had to settle for the omakase burger. Don't be fooled by the pics because the actually burger doesn't turn out like that. I felt the portions were tiny for the price paid. Taste-wise I was happy with the burger so no complaints there. The pizza was pretty average and the ice creams normal. While it was nice to check this place out, it won't be somewhere I would repeatedly visit for lunch

Beautiful picnic garden themed food court with a variety of food truck-like stalls with one of the best serving burgers in Singapore, Omakase! They have Korean, Japanese, Italian, Swiss, Taiwanese, American , sandwiches, fries, crepes, icecream,smoothies and so much dessert. My favorites were the crisp margarita pizza with a load of arugula on top. Superb! The Omakase burger was delicious and truffle fries was heavenly. The Butadon grilled pork on top of scrumptious steamed Japanese rice was out of this worldly Hokkaido Eats.

This super cute 'food court' is set out like a mini-food truck park with in the Wisma Atria shopping centre on Orchard Road. Complete with lots of (fake) plants and flowers, this is lighthearted place for dinner. A cool ordering system works in which you have a buzzer and order at each food 'truck' using your buzzer and you pay for it all on the way out. Great burgers and pork tacos. Great for a family outing

Wanted to try the place, were disappointed. Food/drinks quality very low.Ordered: Roesti potato (not cooked) not up to swiss standart. Not much taste.Burger not nice - not even close. All food no salt. Strawberry milkshake awful, sorry. Not sweet at all. Only nice was can on my ginger ale (ready product).Overcharge a lot for this kind of food.

Nice interesting concept and seating for families and a little entertainment corner for kids.
Delicious food but prices is a bit steep.
Overall, a good experience.
4
Modern upscale food court with up to date way of ordering. Good juicy omakase burger and cheese french fries which somehow taste nachos... creative. Also good tender and juicy grill pork over rice.
5
Tried it as an alternative to food court. Was first intrigued by decor which is actually quite nice: it is essentially a series of food carts. Essentially Western but some Asian food as well
Had the truffle pastas: very good
Will definitely try it again

I visited picnic restaurant at Wisma Atria. What a nice concept. It's a multi cousin restaurant, offering Asian food, burgers, pizza, sweets and many more.
The food was really yummy and the coffee is nice.
Good for kids also.

Was looking for place for lunch on last Sunday and passed by Picnic, and decided to try.The place reminds me of Marché but the design of the whole restaurant is interesting and patrons can actually have their picnic there.There are stalls selling various dishes different countries like Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese, Italian and Jap Burgers. Had the jap rice bowl with pork belly and onsen egg. It was heavenly yummy. My partner had the famous omakase burget and it was juicy.The ambience is nice and so overly crowded. Once you are done, just head to the self service machine to make payment. It is really fast and convenient.Will visit again

Had a very nice meal with loved ones last week. The ambience is pretty interesting. Read online that there were different themes but only seemed to be one - garden theme. There is a mini cartoon area for kids and a pool table as well. You might not want to sit there if your children are easily distracted or if you dont like loud echoes.Food is good but a little pricey.Really loved the steak with foie gras butadon and the nutella crepe (will probably come back only for that).Staff at the front were upbeat and friendly! Smiles all around. However the ones at the beverage and ice cream counter are really grumpy, impatient and could not care less. She stopped listening half way through the order and kept yawning and rolling her eyes.Come for food and ambience, not for service.Similar to Marche style. Order with a device and charge everything to that device. Pay before you leave.Overall, i give a 6/10.*The florals are super Instaworthy! Bring your flower crowns and long maxi dresses on weekdays at non peak periods - you'd probably get a really cool instapic

Overpriced, food average, service was poor, lack of atmosphere. The rosti is bland, the pizza is like school lunch fare, and it’s best to pretend that the signature pork belly prata never existed at all.A critic’s job is to be unbiased. I get that. I try to ignore all the peripheral aspects of a restaurant—just focus on the food. But then, I have as moral obligation to cross that line for the greater good.If I think you can have a better dining experience at the same price eating somewhere else, it’s my duty to say so.Picnic isn’t a bad restaurant. Some people might even love it. I just doubt I’ll ever be one of them. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
4
The ambience catches your eye the moment you step in and you can't stop yourself from wanting to explore the place. It's buzzing, colourful with plenty of cuisine options. The food is a bit pricy but everything we tried was quite tasty. Great to try with kids or for an evening with friends

@TheKuoKnowsPicnic at Wisma is a modern-day twist on the tried-and-tested local food-court concept.It has assembled a few vendors that serve the basics of rice, burgers, pizza and pasta. A bit more variety would not go amiss, though.The Taiwanese vendor does some great noodles and rice with toppings. The Beef Noodles tasted fab, as did the rice with pork. My only gripe is that the portions were a little on the small side. The desserts are quite good. The Blueberry Pie and Ice Cream did just the job to fill in the gaps left by the main course. Perhaps that is why the bowls of rice are smaller than usual.On balance, Pinic does the job. I have been back. And I will go back

Went to have a family dinner (huge group with children) at Picnic located at Wisma. The resturant concept is kind of like mâché with a more international selection of cuisine but not as much variety as mâché. I still prefer mâché as picnic seem to lack a concept, and the food is terribly overpriced. A bowl of Taiwanese beef noodles cost $17, half a roast chicken with loads of fries cost $26. That's very pricey for food that are easily available in Singapore and they are not exclusively unique in taste or Super delicious. That said, they serve a great variety of drinks (yes there's the root beer float that we all missed), alcohol (draft beers) and fresh juices. The desserts are ok. But ice cream is not great and very icy. We ordered crepes with ice cream, crepe is done properly, but the chocolate ice cream is icy and not creamy at all. The fruits that comes with it looks incredibly raw but fresh. Overall, food is not outstanding, service is alright (staff do not clear the plates as swiftly as expected, especially when compared to mâché) and the choices are options you may get from the food court (excluding the omasake burgers & rosti)

At picnic, you are given a tag/token upon entry. This serves both bill and an alert to collect your orders. Similar to marche.
The butadon was very good with generous portions of meat. Worth a try.
3
The whole idea of a picnic cafe is adorable and their execution is prompt. However food was so-so. But I would still drop by if I am in the area.
3
Picnic has nice set up with varieties of food available, nice ambience with colorful decoration..
Food is expensive as compare to other option available in WISMA Atria.
3
Nice ambiance but limited selection of foods and overpriced..
There is no selection of children meals but probably the closest u can get is some western pizza and pasta.
Self check out using NETs and Credit Card only.

Meal : food was great especially the desserts :-) the soup was hearty and filling.
Ambiance: Quite dark
Service: staff was friendly.
Value: mid range
We did encounter an issue when we were making payment ended up we had to pay at the entrance.

A nice food court that is unlike the usual food court.No glaring fluorescent lights here.Better ambience than other food courts.Darker but not too dark.When you enter, they ask for your name and tag it to a device which you will use to order your food. Pay at exit by cash, NETS or credit card.A variety of food from 8 carts. Chalk Farm cakes by Bryan Koh are also available here. There is a Chalk Farm outlet at nearby Paragon.Beef noodles was all I had. Beef needs improvement in terms of tenderness. Strong soup taste which leans towards herbal. Okay but could be better.Will come back to try other dishes

Saturday night Dinner for family of four. Nice layout, and nice staff. I ordered a Pilsner ($12) at the bar and the people next to me asked if they could have tap water (the water is fantastic in Singapore) and the bar staff replied "its $1 per glass ma'am". Ms 12 ordered herself 'Vodka Rigatoni' and when it turned up it had a hot spice (chili powder?) Sprinkled all over it. I checked the description at the truck and it did not mention any spices. Ms 9 loved her nuggets and chips for $9 but was less happy when we found out there was no toilet in the restaurant - you had to go to the shopping centre one behind Starbucks. My DH commented "it is nice that they trust people to come back and pay!"Summary: charging for tap water, no toilet handy, unexpected use of hot spice. Food overall ok but if the food court on the 3rd floor was open it would be our choice

Same concept as marche...but one difference you order the food from the order screen get your number and your buzzer will let u know when the food is readyThe buzzer device will also be required to order the food.Concept is through the food truck concept serving a variety of food. Mind you variety is probably an over statement as there are probably around 6 trucks and each serving a small selection of meals.We had Taiwan beef noodles and pork minced rice...no drinks...costs us s$25...so don't expect it to be cheapOn passing I overheard a customer telling his friend "this is a hawker stall.concept except you pay more"If you are expecting marche, this is not....but the owner has invested a lot of thought and money into this business
3
We had tested this restaurant out of curiosity, the concept a bit like Marche except that they used buzzer to record the food ordered. The decoration is good, it is free seating and the ambient design is in a big garden and greenery. There are a few stalls which offered western, Korean, Japanese, drinks and dessert. The varieties are not very much and a bit over price. We have ordered French & Asian chicken, Spanish rosti, Korean taco, crepes and drinks. Food was average, waited a bit long, staff is friendly.

My family a Party of Five and one two year old eat here recently. The layout is self service with numerous serving stands for a variety of foods. The seating is picnic benches. My two-year-old grandson enjoyed the little kids stage and music he had great fun dancing. As for the food it was very good but perhaps a bit pricey. I had the porchetta sandwich with mashed potatoes iced latte coffee and apple pie for dessert. I can only describe the meal was very good and very filling. My son and wife had Korean tacos. My daughter-in-law had pasta and chocolate cake with ice cream. And my grandson had french fries and some of his mother's pasta. All in the Hall of very nice place I highly recommend it
