If you are a meet lover this is the place to eat , at the heart of arab street, the tabbouleh cafe serves delicious platter at a very affordable price , we tried the mix platter grill and the chicken kofta grill both were well prepared and delicious , The host Eka was very courteous she even gifted a broach she was wearing to my wife ! Thanks Eka wishing you the very best

We ordered a mixed grill based on the menuâ€™s photo which included a juicy and enticing lamb chop. First they served the platter without the lamb chop and the after we insisted them matching the food with the menu, they served us a overly grilled and salty lamb chop as shown in photo. Very disappointing and will never return

We first went here for dinner, I had a Shish Tawouk and my partner had Lamb Chops. The food was good but the male staff not very welcoming, although the woman was. We went there again for lunch and I cannot prove it as I lost the receipt, but I think we were charged double. Would pay to watch

Tabbouleh Lebanese Gourmet Cafe and Restaurant, Located at 41 Arab Street. Tabbouleh offers a Middle Eastern cuisine. The ambience of the restaurant is relaxing and really chill. The food was delicious and portion sizes good for sharing, Tasty food...Hummus and Tabbouleh better than I had in other Middle Eastern restaurants. Kofta Kebah, Kibbeh, and Grilled Halumi, just to mention a few dishes all were scrumptious. Above all, staff and owner are pleasant and obliging, they make sure you are well served and warmly received. Honestly this was possibly the best and most authentic Lebanese food in Singapore. A very enjoyable evening... Will definitely be back for more

We have ordered from Tabouleh via UberEats about three times, the first order was great! The second order was not so great, but we thought we would give them another chance and ordered on a 3rd occasion, but this time it was just awful. The lamb smelled a bit off, and we tried to eat it but was too worried about getting sick. And the baba ganoush was terrible. A very small portion of mainly onion and oil...and cost S$11.50. We ordered baba ganoush from them with our very first order and it was pretty good! So we called them to complain about this particular portion and they just said that it is meant to be that way....So if that is the case, sadly we will definitely not order from them again. Very disappointed

Went on a Sat night and I know it's busy, but what I don't and will never understand is putting up so many tables (even on the streets) and accepting endless customers and orders (even UBER and GRAB Food - two riders were obviously pissed off waiting for the food for a long time) YET UNDERSTAFFING the restaurant. There were only 2 staff when we dine in. The boss only came to help after a commission between his staff and a couple who left pissed off and paid only $20 (I heard the bill was close to $50) coz they've been waiting for the bill for so long coz the staff just couldn't attend to their call anymore. For our table, it even took a while before our order was taken. Drinks were not served and I have to get it myself from the fridge. They even forgotten my mango Aryan drink. I also have to get our own serving plate coz the staff already looked very helpless. But I would say not the staff's fault for attending too many tables, it was the boss' MISMANAGEMENT. I even suggested to them to remove all the tables on the streets so they can attend to us properly. TOO GREEDY for money and taking the customers for granted. Not going back again. I'm sure there are other tasty food around this Arab district

Every so often you stumble across an unassuming, humble little place that hits the mark perfectly. This is one of those. I am a regular now, I went again for an early lunch today and they were washing the floors and making the place spick and span as usual - it is always really clean and tidy. The management and staff really look after this little place. I saw one of the other reviews mention a lack of ambience but I disagree. This is a basic little place with plastic chairs and table cloths and an open front so you can watch the hustle and bustle of Arab Street. The food is really well done and they take pride in their food. I invariably go for the mixed meze which is made on the premises (humous, Lebanese breads, Baba ghanoush, etc), the chicken livers are amazing, followed by the mixed grill. My Daughter has the lamb wrap which she raves about. I have come here with business, with friends, with family. It really is a great little place and never had a bad meal here and always good value. You can go to other higher end places for similar food and pay 4 times the amount without 4 times the quality. Try it, I'm confident you will love it too!

returned here after more than a year. found that they made some changes - nicer table setting - table cloth. additional local dishes added to the menu. they printed a new menu. but the food is still as good as before. must trys are the beet root salad, chicken kofta, falafel (my all time favorite). the lentil soup which i tried for the first time was rather nice. can't say much about service as we were the only ones there at 630pm - probably a tad too early, so we got served pretty quickly after being seated. the mint tea is nice - but pretty pricey for a just a small cup with fresh mint leaves. it's good to come in a bigger group and share the food

You will always get value for money in this place! The food is really tasty and the service very good. The venue is somewhat basic but the food is really enjoyable with a good Lebanese choice.
5
But don't expect great hygiene. Plates between 20-30 dollars, starters around 10.
But food was very tasty and also attracted local Lebanese crowd.
5
we had the mixed grill which was plentiful and tasty.
close to the masjid mosque so the atmosphere at prayer time was quite amazing
4
The food was good but the ambience could've been better. The service was also good. We're vegetarians and we found a lot of options. Would go there again.
4
Despite initial misgivings about sitting on the street, next to parked and passing cars, we had a simple and cheap meal. Everything was freshly cooked and tasted as much, the tzatziki, falafels and breads were superb.
5
Exquisite food and friendly service. Highly recommended. We went there for dinner, the food was hot and served promptly. Would go there again.
4
We had lamb koftas with tabouli- very filling and tasty with the dips supplied. A neat little restaurant with friendly staff.
5
Great little Lebanese restaurant in the Arab Quarter of Singapore. Good selection of dishes. My wife is vegetation and she was particularly happy with the choices.

Relaxing atmosphere, good food, friendly service. Try the mixed grill. Also the baba ganouche is tasty. Best to go with friends. No alcohol served there so be aware in case you prefer a beer with dinner

No Cheese Fatayer but spring rolls , Samosa with chicken instead of falafel , tabbouleh without much taste the rest that we ordered was fine ! Service was friendly but not efficient I waited for my drink half of my dinner , had to ask for bread multiple time and got 1 of the basket when we were nearly done with the food , they went next door to get the coffee done , some of the food was fresh and some reheated . I would say that if you are not a big fan of Libanese food or don't know it then the place and food are fine but if you do know libanese food you may be disappointed !

Had lunch here. Hummus and pitta bread, lovely salad of beetroot, chickpeas, tomatoes and halloumi. Minced lamb dish with yoghurt and other ingredients. Overall, food was good, generous portions and affordable. Service was good as well.
2
We didn't like our food there. It was tasteless and the chicken seemed to be reheated in the microwave.
The service also was not the best. They need to improve!!!
5
As a vegan I am always happy to come across Middle Eastern food as there are always choices for me. We had humus, baba ganoush and falafel served with pitta which was fresh from the oven. I was delicious.
2
Dry and flavorless falafel wrap- needed sauce or something. The lamb kebab dish was just a few pieces of lamb and a huge plate of French fries. No vegetables. Definitely won't be back.

The place is simple but the food is good and affordable. This is a good option for a quick meal near the Arab street. Good Lebanese food ... Ask the assorted entries ... Very tasty .

We have been trying different foods every night. Tonight we decided to come here. We ordered multiple items and shared family style so we could all taste. Was there on Wednesday night and we were the only ones.Service was good and the food came out in pieces, but was fine since we were sharing. Overall the food was good. Not excellent but better than average

I ordered cheese fatayer and they gave me bland vegetable spring rolls with Parmesan cheese sprinkled on top. They knew that they had done so, because as soon as I took it up to the counter, they started protesting that that's what it was meant to be, even though the menu described it as feta wrapped in pastry. It was clearly not what I ordered, it tasted horrible and I am ashamed that I paid for it.

We popped by on a Saturday evening after a movie. It was not busy as it was still early evening but despite a large number of waitstaff hanging around motivating them to do anything besides watching the girls go by was a huge effort of patience. Everything was too much trouble for them, including taking an order, getting us drinks, supplying glasses with the drinks.... Luckily the food made up for it. Good vegetarian options. Haloumi was a bit on the over cooked side but the rest was goo
2
We took a risk with so few comments on trip advisor and we quickly regretted our choice.You certainly do not chose this restaurant for the ambiance which is close to a scholl kitchen but we were expected to be happily surprised by the food but unfortunately this did not happen. I chose the Mussaka and have not recognized this famous greek plate at all ! My wife and daughter chose another meal with chicken and bread and almost did not touch their plates...I would definitely not recommend this restaurant the worst of all the restaurants we selected during our stay in Singapor

Very tired after a long flight. Not yet used to the tropical heat. However we scored a table near the air con and was good. Unfortunately the fish had finished but we found some lovely delicious food. Tabboueh falafel and lamb.

Don't believe the haters. Good food. Good prices. Good service.
Hummus- delicious
Babaganoush- delicious
Kofta kebab- delicious
Service- solid and attentive (but busy).
My go-to for middle eastern in Singapore.

This was our first venture into Arab Street and our very first sample of Lebanese food, we were not disappointed. A great meal was enjoyed, the food was extremely tasty filled with great tastes. The service was good and the atmosphere set for an enjoyable evening in Arab street

Sadly a very bad choice for lunch in an area full of near-Eastern restaurants. Quite a nice, quiet place to sit and no hassle (unlike some of the places), but that's where the good bit stops. Service, although the place was not busy, was very slow. And then the food came. The hummus was sort of OK, if bland. But the tabbouleh simply wasn't. Which is somewhat surprising. This isn't exactly a hard dish to make, but it is not roughly chopped (tasteless) parsly and tomato with a slice of lemon. Somewhere there should be some bulgur, some mint, some herbs... all totally missing. The main dish filled the plate - a mixed grill. Again cooked without any real love or interest. The beef was chewy. The rice uninspired. Two blobs of some out-of-a-bottle sauces, one pale cream the other violent pink, and some other items that defied description. Just a pathetic attempt at food. A shame really. A very lazily run establishment that doesn't deserve to survive in the food heaven that is Singapore. And not even all that cheap. Avoid at all costs

Wandering around Kampong Glam looking for a place to eat is not easy. There are a lot of eateries competing for your attention. We stopped and chatted to the owner who was talking to passers-by in the Middle Eastern tradition. The menu looked good and they had a high-chair for our toddler so we stopped in.We've eaten quite a lot of Turkish and Moroccan food over the years, but I would say that the hummus was the best I have ever tasted. We had a mezzo plate and a mixed grill and both were excellent. The restaurant is family owned and run and they were friendly and provided great service without being over-bearing or intrusive.Pricing was reasonable given the quality of the food and the ingredients, but don't expect to pay street food prices.The children loved the food too. We'll definitely eat here again on our next trip to Singapore

A really good find at the end of Arab Street. We had a quick meal here as vegetarian, gluten free customers. They spent time helping with the options and changed the offerings to help us find a great combination which suited our restrictions. One waiter was good, the other was a little absent, but luckily not ours. A nice open atmosphere with really fast service. Excellent Mousaka and Foul Medames. The saffron rice was pretty good too
5
We stumbled upon this cafe, which appeared to be fairly new and very quiet. WE were actually looking for the cafe next door but liked the look of this one more. Anyway, it was an unexpected pleasure. The place was basic but clean and tidy, and the food and service excellent. It was plentiful, too, and naturally good value. Highly recommended for lunch and a no fills dinner
5
We tried Tabbouleh earlier in the week for dinner, and were so impressed that we returned three more times for lunch or dinner over the past few days. Very nicely prepared Lebanese fare. Amazing falafels. And the garlic sauce served with the wraps is amazing. Prompt and unobtrussive service; reasonable prices. We'll likely be back for lunch tomorrow
5
after the mixed reviews I was wondering was I in the correct place? Small in stature but huge in flavour. The food was amazing I ate till I couldn't move. Fresh ingredients and the owner chef Mohammad was very friendly. The service was attentive and I didn't wait long for my food, it was a Monday night but still seemed busy. I'd suggest to go for dinner rather than lunch. I had the Mezze plate of dips wonderful and the kibbeh , and the mix grilled of flavoured meats. I will be back agai

When we visited at lunchtime the cafÃ© was quiet and only the one waiter was present. service before and after we'd eaten was rather slow, but then we weren't in any hurry. The food is tasty and authentic (perhaps a bit more seasoning on the salad), excellent falafel and hummus and my limonana was perfect, with the really sharp lemon offset by the mint. Its also very, very reasonably priced, so give it a try unless you're in a hurry
