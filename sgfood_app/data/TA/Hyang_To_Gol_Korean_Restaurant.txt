Good place to have a gathering at a centralised location. A wide variety of food choices and food is fresh.
5
Great meal always - good variety & high quality side dishes. Main dish are up to mark. A good experience again with my family.
4
I like the lunch set - good choices available: Seafood Bean curd soup, Bibimbap, Ginseng Chicken soup, Spicy Stir-fry education Pork, Seafood Bean paste Stew. All my favourite !!
4
Have been patronising hyangtogol @ Amara for many 7-8 years. Love the food and our fav dishes like spicy raw crab are still consistent. Love the bbq set too!
4
Great variety of different Korean dishes ranging from meats for grilling, stews and Hot pots for sharing. The place I would bring my friends and family to, for a meal gathering.
4
The food was good especially the black cod hot pot. Appetisers are good especially the kimchi, seaweed and potato. We were given a private room which was good with children around. However, the staff did not inform us there was free ice cream provided.,Incidentally, I found it out myself-
4
Banchan: even though the kimchee is not bad, the variety is quite limited compared to other Korean restaurants. BBQ: Meat is OK, the sauce is so so only.I had a good tofu kimchee soup, and the potato cake was nice, but the rest didn't taste as flavorful. However the staff were OK, and in general I had a good experience. I would not mind coming back to try other dishes.

Love the BBQ marinated pork n pork belly. Very generous helping of their side dishes. The sweet Kimchi is very addictive. Loved their hot white rice with tofu seafood soup. Seafood pancakes were awesome. For the 4 of us, price was pretty fine. Best of all I could earn DreamTrips points.The only disappointment was their free ice cream. Taste strange and frozen. Kind of funny to be offering Potong ice cream for a Korean restaurant. Would have been better if it was more Korean related ice cream. But it was nice to have such thoughts to offer free ice cream. Would definitely go dine again
4
The variety of Korean food offered is wider than the average Korean restaurants.We loved the banchan.There were many Koreans at the restaurant so I guess the food must be pretty authentic.It is a bit pricey compared to other Korean restaurants.Service is very prompt and the atmosphere is great for gatherings.

Had early dinner around 6pm on a weekday night, relatively early so the restaurant is pretty empty with just a few tables filled. Service was efficient and fast.Bulgogi beef set ($15.90) - quite a large amount of beef serving, marinated well and cooked tender and really soft. Upgraded the rice to brown rice ($1), rice was the soft and slightly mushy kind like Japanese ones but I like it. Ramyeon ($12.90) - added in army stew ($5) consisting of sausages, ham, cheese. The original one is plain just noddles with some rice cakes. Soup is tasty not overly rich, flavorful yet light. A comforting dish I would say.Brown rice tea ($1) - cheap for the iced version and refillable. Taste wise normal.Side dishes - doesn't feel very koreanish to me. Apart from the kimchi, it felt rather Japanese. The hard boil marinated egg was boring and slightly overcooked. Seaweed normal served with some bimbimbap sauce. The salad was purple cabbage with potatoes marinated in some mayo like salad dressing, too westernized.Overall huge portion and tasty Korean MAIN dishes. The sides can be improve. Bill came up to $44+ for both of us, affordable but not cheap
5
it took us a few times to realise it but besides the good food, a standout is the service. The team works well together and are very responsive. we really enjoyed dining here.
4
Food here is nice and the staff are very attentive. Those starter side dishes are very nice and good. Would like to visit again in future.
5
This was our second time back. The food is very tasty and I'd recommend the BBQ premium beef and spring onion pancakes. It's a busy place but efficiently-run.
4
Wonderful food and service. Always a delight to be dining here! Service was attentive and the meat was cooked to perfection. May I add that they serve the best seafood tofu stew? It's wonderful! Try it!

Ok, so three of us visited the Tanjong Pagar Rd outlet (in the Amara Hotel) tonight, my wife, our daughter, and myself. The outlet was quiet and our orders were taken very promptly, the food arrived and was largely very good. However there was one very large problem.One of the dishes was cooked vegetables in an egg batter. While my wife was eating them she kept finding a large number of smallish pieces of a hard material. Initially we thought it was crab shell and were a little unhappy, due to the possibility of damaging our teeth. When we got the manager to examine the hard pieces he identified them as pork bone. This brought the whole meal to a sudden halt as we do not take pork due to our family's religious beliefs.We rechecked the menu to confirm the nowhere in the dish's description was any indication of the presence of pork in that dish. The manager was very apologetic and told us that it was a mistake made in the kitchen. He handled our complaints very professionally, offering discounts and additional dishes to compensate for our upset. However, what had been intended as something of a family celebration ended on a rather sour note
5
Went to the raffles city basement branch. We had the BBQ chicken, pork and beef sets which comes with side dishes, soup and rice. The children and elderly liked the three types of meat and preferred the beef most. There's a long queue for dinner after we were seated which is telling of the quality of food served. Will visit again with family for other dishes
4
Dishes are pretty good, would highly recommend the jap chae and the $59 beef for 160g (should be on the first page of meats on the menu). Quality of meat is the best I've had at any Korean bbq! Service is a bit patchy - they gave me a fork to eat the complimentary ice-cream with - but overall the restaurant is reminiscent of a fuss-free sit down dinner with comforting food.
4
Not my first time to this restaurant, but for an authentic korean meal I decided to bring my parents to this place. Reservations was easily made online, and no delay in getting our table. Ordered food and as my parents didnt like to have their food grilled in front of them, the staff gladly helped us to grill at another table. Side dishes were abit dull compared to other korean restaurants, and noticed that a squid side was filled mainly with raw garlic and chilli - very little squid. When asked for refills, it came back with more raw garlic and chilli - so was abit disappointed. Food wise, the grilled squid was very normal, fresh squid and some sauce for $20plus which we felt was overpriced. The galbi jjim was the best dish we ordered for the evening with praises from everyone. Will consider coming back, but maybe only for the galbi jjim
4
Went there with a group of friends for dinner.Service was good, though at times the restaurant felt a little under-staffed due to the big dinner crowd. Nevertheless the staff worked really hard to attend to all guests, always smiling (except for a member of the kitchen staff who occasionally served some dishes. He looked rather grumpy).The servings of kimchi were excellent, as was the seafood pancake
4
Recommended by ex-Korean colleagues, this is an excellent F&B outlet to enjoy good authentic Korean food at a reasonable price. Service staff & ambience were equally commendable. The seafood pancake was great, so was the hotpot. We were pleasantly surprised by the spread of side dishes and their Colours! A must try but to avoid disappointment, best to make a reservation even for lunch as the joint seems pretty crowded
4
located within amara hotel, highly recommend their seafood pancake and grilled meats. was there on a Friday night and service was alittle slow as the place was packed
4
- Good variety of side dishes with high standards
- Great bbq meat
- many korean having their meals here as well
4
Food And place is good but disappointed by chope. My reservation is not in the list. Lucky the restaurant managed to find a seating for me.
5
The set dinner with 2 mains, 1 appetizer (seafood pancake), the small appetizers and a desert for only S$51.79 nett!
Well worth the money for at least 3 people!
Quality of food is also very good with fresh seafood and tasty dishes!
5
authentic Korean food with all the necessary spices and chilli.
Good service, food quality and quantity. Great for drinks and a night out

we had set lunch for 3,start from appetizing cold sour and spicy kimchi soup,follow by beef set with white rice, side dish(refillable) :-green veg-black fungus with squid-kimchi -seaweed soup. -hot green tea in the cup , and a piece of orange. we ordered additional seafood pancake recommend by other advisor, it was surprisingly tasty, especially the sauce make it taster better. highly recommend to have a try. in the end ,an â˜ºfriendly aunty (service crew) brought each of us a scoop of vanilla ice cream to end the meal. sitting is quit comfortable even it was packed lunch time. only thing have to mention about is the service, not much smile ,no communication with customer other than taking order. when serve the dishes to table a lot of cutlery noise made. it's a image of restaurant down of manpower for us. wish they can improve this part
5
Huge Variety of BBQ meat selections. Similarly there are many different kind of soups you can choose from. The Jokbal was really good especially wrapped with the special sauce given. one hindsight, the ventilation is not very good so please expect to smell after your mea
3
The extensive side dishes impressed me with ice cream served as dessert after your meal. There was like endless items listed in the menu and it differs from most Korean restaurants in Singapore. One highlight would be the spicy black cod fish and give their seafood pancake a miss as it only contains miserable chopped portions of prawn embedded in the flavourful batter if youre a seafood lover. Overall, the peaceful ambiance and good service makes it a good location to relax after work.

Had dinner with friends at HyangToGol after seeing some reviews about this korean restaurantNothing spectacular about this restaurant and the place is a bit run-down.BBQ food was ok but the service is still professionalA place to recommend for korean food likers and business gatheringDr E.Cho

Went there twice. Both times, We ordered a large Army Stew - Pork, amd were told that the soup base was ox/beef base amd Kimchi pancake.Army Stew - if have more meats it be better. Soup is refillable. Ramyeon additional cost. Kimchi pancake - 6pcs thin.Service is needs improvement! SIGHSeems overstaffs, and not organised, not knowledgeable, and you have to get the waitress to check with the manager instead she initiates to go.Ie: When you ask for a waitress, one pushes another one to attend it.Price was slighly higher due to its located at the hotel. But if to compare the quality and quantities.. better to go for other korean restaurants.Overall, I wont waste my time, money and energy to visit this plc
5
Good food. We place the order in advance as we had limited meal time, the staff were very nice to allow pre order.
3
Pretty slow service. Had to wait quite a while to be served with my food. I think they can be more efficient and look at the customers' need more often.
4
Korean bbq restaurant close to Chinatown, decent food.Went there with two colleagues, but being new to the concept we over-ordered. The quality was good, the atmosphere friendly and the service excellent. They kindly and spontaneously offered us a doggy bag afterwards.
4
Booked a private room and it looks a little run down. The good and service more than made up for it though. Everything was done without having to ask and the food was delicious!
4
Good Korean food and I personally love the Jap Chae and kimchi soup. Price is reasonable for the amount and quality of the food. Also, the restaurant is very generous with the side dish.Hyang To Gol is always my first choice when I crave for Korean food.
3
Ordered chap chae, samyeopsal to grill, and kalbi tang. These came with various appetisers including kimchi, cold fungus and honeyed dried small fish. Orders are small; when one makes a comparison with servings/price in other korean restaurants, Hyang to gol is wanting. Flavour is a lacking too (the kalbi tang can be spicier, the samyeopsal can be more tender like they do it in Bornga), perhaps the taste has been adjusted to suit local preference? The meal ended with a serving of cold drink made of ginger and red date (nice!)Service was attentive and prompt though (thank you!), even if the lunch crowd was kind of big
5
Best Korean I've had since leaving NYC and DC two cities with great Korean restaurants. As a Korean American on long term travel, I am constantly looking for good Korean food and often disappointed. My yukgae jang and haemul pajeon were excellent and banchan best I've had in a long time. Will go back!

Unsure abt korean restaurant service in singapore, but for 1 in a hotel, disappointed with the service and food presentation.Eating with 1 friend. Ordered 2 dishes from the chef recommendation menu. No where in it mention it would be sets with rice and soup and side dishes.Keen for the Sgs 28 ala carte eel, so the waitress advised us to order a smaller one that comes with a set costing sgd17.8 because it comes with rice and is smaller for 2 to share. Was thinking of ordering a pancake also. So 2 chef recommended dishes with 1 set meal and 1 pancake should cover enough for 2 hungry stomach.Turns out the 2 chef meals were sets. And the eel was also set. That comes 3 sets for 2 person. I told the waitress i dont need that many sets. And to upgrade the tiny eel to the larger ala carte. Turns out larger ala carte eel has only 1 slice of eel extra. Making it 4 slices. (Picture showed 5 large sizes that filler the plate) the waitress explained that it is almost sgd10 more expensive because it comes with larger side dishes, not larger eel slices.. so technically, u pay quite alot not for the main course but for the sides.....Kimchi pancake came out uncut also..Gonna summarize this to poor waitress service, poor damage control, and too expensive pricing for measly portion, misleading menu pictures also.....The only thing yummy was the beef tofu kimchi soup
2
It just opened so we went to try. The Ginseng Chicken Soup without taste of ginseng. Which small Asian-sized customer would eat a single person set and have a whole chicken? And the chicken was so hard; seems cooked beforehand stuffed with glutinous rice and ginseng then boiled with the soup, leaving the soup with out the essence of the ginseng
3
We dined here in a group of 6 on a Friday night and were not impressed by the food or service. We ordered the $150 meat set, 2 seafood pancakes and a chicken dish which was enough for 6. The bill came up to $400 which is reasonable considering that we had a bottle of wine and a few bottles of beer.The $150 meat set came with one plate of lettuce, which you're meant to wrap around the meat and dip in the dipping sauce. There was insufficient lettuce with the meat set and they charged us $6 for another plate of vegetables. $6 is not a lot of money but considering how much we spent in total, it could have been given complimentary.The only plus is that they will barbeque the meat for you if you ask. All in all it was a very average meal and you can get better value elsewhere. I will not be returning again
4
I will always visit this restaurant when I miss Samgyetang .
Highly recommended. Beside that the service was good.
4
We paid $55/pax for 3 meat for BBQ cooked fish, seafood pancake.
The service was good, but overall prices on the expensive range
5
nice food and expansive menu! the largest beef selection we've seen in singapore. a bit noisy but i guess it's typical of korean restaurants.
4
Definitely try their marinated beef + they had this vegetable side dish that was a little spicy but very crunchy and appetising.
3
We went for lunch on the reco of a Korean client. We had premium beef, assorted pancakes and kimchi soup a la carte.Well the fresh kimchi is very delicious and so are the rest of the free assorted appetizers and my wife's kimchi soup.But the rest... Meat marinade tasted like curry? Pancakes were undercooked and side order of vegetables was mostly onions instead of mushrooms.Waiters were super stressed and atmosphere was borderline psychotic due to them not being able to handle the lunch crowd.Still they are friendly.Our bbq table broke down mid meal and they had to cook at another table.Value is not so good. We will probably not return
5
8 people only cost like $250. First time visited her during my birthay in December 2015. First impression about the interior design are very good. Because i get the feeling in Seoul. Then order, by the time we eat the food taste wonderfull. And by the time we paid. The price was surprisingly reasonabl
5
Despite Singapore do have many Korean restaurant, Hyang To Gol Korean Restaurant is always my top choice. The food there are authentic. My hubby and I especially love the lunch set, Ginseng Chicken Soup, pan cake and beef rib BBQ. The price is average, not over the top. The service sometimes are not that perfect with large crowded. Nevertheless, we love to eat there
4
Lunch at hotel sounds to be very luxury treat, but Hyang To Gol offer really good lunch set with reasonable price. I had the kimchi soup set with $10++ during my viist. You will be served with a cold spicy kimchi soup like side dish. It tasted good. Your main course will contain 4 side dishes on their choice and I had kimchi soup, probably that is one of the best kimchi soup that I love. After the meal, you will be served a desserts kind of drink. Very good value I will said

If there’s one place where you would like to have a good Korean lunch without hurting the wallet too much, check out this place at Amara hotel. Tucked away in a little corner of the 2nd floor of Amara hotel, this place is not that difficult to find at all. The appearance of the entrance may not look much appealing, but the lunch sets on offer are decent and worth every penny. I’ve been here on several occasions with friends and I must say that I’ve not been disappointed every time. I always go for the set lunches as they are the most value for money. Choosing from beef, chicken, pork, kimchi soup amongst others, the meat comes on a hot platter served together with rice. Like all Korean establishments, the Korean meal is not complete without the side dishes. What I find unique about this place which other Korean restaurants I’ve been to don’t offer, is that they serve you an additional cold drink just before the meal itself. It’s slightly sour to the taste buds but refreshing.Ambience wise, the tables are pretty much set up for authentic BBQ with a depression into the table where you can barbeque your food. For lunch time the tables are transformed into flat table tops so the BBQ sets are all hidden in the table. From all the times I’ve been there, it seems a very popular place for people to bring their business associates for lunch here. It’s not your every lunch meal that you would come here to eat. However it is a suitable dining location with friends on a special occasion, like a birthday or a promotion. Overall cost less than SGD20 per person including drinks and GST + service charge. If you’re in the Tanjong Pagar area, craving for Korean food and on a small budget during lunch time, I would certainly recommend this place. Go for the set lunches. Overall 5 stars for me for a lunch time meal

Korean BBQ is becoming so popular that we see a new restaurant popping up in every few months. Hyang To Gol had been around for years but it is certainly one of the better ones among its peers. First, the meat selection was quite extensive and carry some good premium beef. The side dishes were one notch better than most other Korean BBQ restaurants. For example, they offer freshly made Kimchi which is healthier and and tasted fresh. The seafood pancake was one of the best I had tried. While we were there, we saw quite a few Korean groups which was a sign of authenticity of its food. The restaurant is spacious and comfortable with good ventilation. Service was quite prompt but a lot more friendliness will help. We were very happy with the food
4
The most consistently good food and service. I think most of the bad reviews were because of price, but you get what you pay for.
4
Good place to go for anyone willing to experience Korean food in Singapore.
Quite a wide variety of appetizers and also a fairly long list of main courses.

Good beef BBQ

I went here with a few work colleagues and very much enjoyed the experience. We got a load of dishes and each one was very tasty. It's a great novelty to have a BBQ in the middle of the table and great fun also. The restaurant is a bit formal and I presume there are better Korean BBQs in Singapore, but all in all I enjoyed it
4
Located on 2nd floor of Amara Hotel, this restaurant was awarded by Korea Food Foundation as one of the world's top 5 overseas korean restaurant. So i went with my family recently and truly enjoyed the dinner, which was high value for money, good and attentive service where meat was cooked in front of us.There is an outlet in Sentosa Resort's World Waterfront
3
The food is good but not distinguishable. Service is not very attentive, and about one third of the staff don't speak English. The decor is kind of non-descript. The set lunch is exceptionally good value, but it's also..quite bad. To avoid unless you stay at the Amara hotel or are stuck in this area of town

I have been to this place a dozen times and have always said that the true test of a good KOrean restaurant is when you bring Korean guests there. The side dishes are just as good i.e. the staple kimchi and the other vegetables sides. My favorite is the Sangae Tang or Ginseng Chicken Soup. The beef barbecues are very delectable and the cooking is all done by the expert hands of the waitresses. There is no smoke coming into the resturant as the smoke is sucked in by a fan underneath the hot plate. You can also order the pre cooked bulgogi or kogees which tend to be a little overcooked. But sweet nevertheless.You could also opt to have a room reservation and it does not have to have a minimum spend or a different room menu (unlike some Japanese restaurants). There is defintely value for money because you could keep ordering the side dished without loading up on the $$$.I highly recommend this restaurant for those who have not ventured into true Korean cuisines. Of course you will not find puffer fish or other expensive stuff which is quite common in Seoul. But you will certainly find the right range of tastes here.Chuka Hamnid

Hyang To Gol is one of the posher Korean restaurants, with fairly nice and comfortable surroundings within a hotel. Hence it is a more appropriate setting for business lunches.The menu is extensive with a good variety of banchan. Portion sizes are decent, and if going with a larger crowd, you can also book the private dining room.Prices vary, the set lunches are quite reasonably priced but the dinner menu is much pricer.They serve a heavenly homemade sweet ginger with pine nut tea after the meal - it is refillable if you ask nicely.Since the food quality is good, it's really value for money to go during lunchtime. For dinner time, it's probably better to go with a crowd to enjoy the wide variety of food and split the costs

This restaurant is specially set up for Korean BBQ; the premises are airy and quite spacious. We rate it a very good restaurant for standard of food, ambience and pricing. The extensive menu highlights Beef, marinated as well as unmarinated, and offered at various prices depending on grade and quality. Seafood choices are rather limited, with the Squid and Mackerel (Saba) being our favourites. Very good service from the waitstaff, who also do all the table-side cooking. The "Smoke-free" BBQ system works really well
