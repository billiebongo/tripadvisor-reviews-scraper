It was on my birthday - 7th of February.
Probably the best restaurant experience ever. The food and wine excellent, the service incredible - the owner and family made this the event for life.
Every lover of Italian food should visit this wonderful place.
5
Celebrated a special occasion , and the team made this a very unique one . Food is fantastic and authentic, made and served by the family - returning again and again and love it
5
Just simple professionals who love to feed :) Been there more than 3 times in a week. It says it all.
5
Authentic Italian food with a homely feel. The staffs make you feel welcome and the food is amazing. We went with the No Menu Option which was something like an Omakase. The dishes were fantastic and balanced throughout. The only downside was it was quite pricey so go only when its a special occasion
5
No Menu is a rarity in Asia: proper Italian ingredients with an Italian chef and family to cook, serve and most importantly, welcome. One could tell immediately that the Roma tomatoes were not the pale soggy Asian-grown tomato substitutes used in most of Asia's so-called Italian restaurants. These tasted like tomatoes and like Italy. The burrata was heavenly, likewise the prosciutto. We sampled the cannelloni, the insalata mista, and my perennial favourite, linguine vongole, a dish usually mis-managed in most Asian restaurants. No Menu's proper execution included the white clam sauce derived from the simple act of heating the unopened clams in a savoury garlic, white wine and parsley broth. No inundations of tinned clam sauce or lashings of, heaven forbid, cream as an ill thought rendering of "white" sauce. The bread at the table was always topped up throughout the meal, and was brilliant - the few leftovers there were came home with me and the bread and burrata was gorgeous next day. The only drawback is the noise level in the restaurant - being popular, it was full and being in Asia, was noisy. Nothing to do about that - the food more than compensates

Located in a shop house this Italian restaurant provides expensive Italian food. The waiter was very determined to up sell ( we wanted a simple pasta meal) and it required some determination to resist his suggestions. We had brought a bottle of wine as Trip Advisor reviews has indicated no corkage. The waiter demanded $50 as corkage for our wine. We reverted to the menu where the cheapest single bottle of wine cost much more than the meal. The food was very good and apart from the upselling the service was excellent. Complementary extras of small plates of cheese and sweets after the meal were very welcome. A nasty surprise with the bill. We were actually charged for 2 bottles of wine, rapidly and courteously corrected. A place for a special occasion not for three friends wanting a casual meal of a glass of wine and a plate of pasta. Not rushing back
5
This was my second visit and I love everything about this restaurant. The food is authentic and delicious, the service is wonderful. You are warmly greeted when you arrive and nothing is too much trouble for the staff. It feels like an authentic Italian family restaurant

Paying a premium for a good meal, in a nice restaurant, on a big night out with friends is to be expected in Singapore, we're used to it. However, when you're spending in the range of SGD 250 per head, you expect things to come close to great and sadly, No Menu does not come anywhere near.3 starters, 4 main courses, 2 bottles of wine and only 1 starter, 1 main course and 1 bottle of wine hit the mark.A rushed service team (we had to ask them to slow down), bland clams, chewy prawns, horribly presented tortellini, an almost sweet and sour sauce accompanying the gnocchi and $300+ bottle of wine that we discussed was not what we were looking for at all, so overall, No Menu was a complete let down.The burrata is excellent, we all agreed on that, we like the setting but the kitchen need to do A LOT better to justify these kinds of prices in Singapore where there are MANY better Italian restaurants to choose from
4
Cosy family run restaurant that serves whatever the chef has prepared for the day. One cannot go wrong with the recommendations and the dining atmosphere make you think that you are in Italy, if not for the subtle Singapore elements that the owners make it a point to incorporate
5
Simply the best. Pricey but you know what you’re paying for when you see and taste the dishes. Every plate leaving the kitchen is perfect.Home style cooking with a touch of extravaganza, honest and authentic dishes. This is run as a family business in an old shophouse, atmosphere is warm and friendly and unpretentious
3
Food here is above average but the portions are a little on the small side. We had the degustation menu and it was ok but nothing great. There are better places in Singapore for Italian food in this price range.
4
One of the best , real authentic Italian food , the entire family working there , feels like a private home , fantastic atmosphere and the food is absolutely amazing , don't worry they have a menu , and it's plenty , will definitely return
5
Everything was great! The food is delicious (especially the burrata cheese).
Very cozy place with excellent and friendly service
5
This restaurant is very cosy. They serve great Italian food with great great service.
I recommend for couples and business groups.

If you like splendid food, in Singapore, then youShould go to Boon Tat Street, to a place called "No Menu".Though its in Singapore, the food is Italian,Which is so good it deserves a big gold medallion!Its a family affair, a sign always quite good,The girls run the tables, while Papa cooks the food.The fare is superb in this great ristorante,And it can be washed down with a lovely Chianti.They do have a menu, but if you are wise,You should ask for "no menu" and get a surprise -Four courses resplendent with tastes in each dish,The only choice is whether you prefer meat or fish.The Hawkers are cheaper, as is Satay Street,But this is a special place where you can eat,So the next time you feel like an outstanding venue,You should book a wee table down at "No Menu"
5
A friend booked this venue at short notice and, not having had time to find out more, I had no idea what to expect. Wow, what a delicious surprise!The Italian staff were friendly and passionate about their food, immediately making us feel welcome, there was a great buzz on the ground floor and the food was superb.Of course, being close to the CBD and with such high quality food, this experience doesn’t come cheap but this is still well worth visiting for authentic high quality Italian cuisine. This would be a great place for a business lunch.Total lunch bill (for two): SGD280 (burrata cheese, cold cuts, a huge veal Milanese for sharing, one tiramisu, two glasses of red and two coffees)

No Menu. Located at 23 Boon Tat Street, Singapore. Been of an Italian background, I am always on the watch for good Italian restaurants. This restaurant offers authentic Italian food. The environment is relaxed and you feel like you are dining in a friend’s home. Food is very well presented and nice portions too. We tried several dishes that was on offer, all delicious with the real Italian taste. The highlight for me was antipasti, several type of pastas, and the grill beef rib eye all were outstanding. Unfortunately after all that food we were just too full to try the desserts, which I'm sure they must be delicious, anyway I must confess it was the tastiest Italian food I've had for a while , the price tag is on the high side but what the hack if the food and wine is outstanding . About the Service and atmosphere also get really high marks! Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience, exquisite food and great wine selections. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality Italian cuisine. I’m sure we will come back very soon

Had a wonderfully dinner here last week, the food really is excellent. Strongly recommend keeping an eye on the daily specials, they always have some excellent dishes on there. Service is great, friendly and helpful. This place isn’t cheap, three of us shared a starter, a bowl of pasta each, one bottle of wine and the bill was $100 per head.
4
We walked by and very lucky to have a table but only for 90 min after that we were told the Place was full.I started with Vitello Tonnato and it was not the best I had a bit blend in the taste.My wife had Clams and mussels which was good. For main we had fried sole fish with lemonsauce and Linguine with Scampi both was good. We did share a Gianduja chocolate dish with mascarpone and hazelnuts it was excellent and highly recomended. A Espresso with the house only Grappa was an end for me. A half bottle of Chianti Antinori Riserva was also on the tabled mostly for me!!
5
After almost 10 years living in Singapore and great lovers of Italian cuisine, I can say we tried lots of Italian restaurants. Last week we have dinner in No Menu restaurant for the first time and I can say this is the best experience we’ve ever had if we consider the food, the service and atmosphere.This is a family restaurant. They managed to create a nice ambiance like in trattoria in Italy. They also use Fresh ingredients from Italy and France. We had pastas, Tiramisu and Panna Cotta on that night. All were really tasty. And in addition, we were offered a cup of Prosecco while waiting for our table to be ready, nice fresh homemade bread during the dinner and complementary apple cake after dessert. The wine was also really good. The service was efficient, professional but not overwhelming.All in all we had a wonderful evening and can’t stop thinking: “Why had we keep waiting so long before coming here !”.As we live just in the neighbourhood, I’m sure we will come back very soon
4
Cozy atmosphere, excellent service. Had the burrata, garlic prawn spaghetti and tiramisu which was excellent except for the prawn which was overcooked. It is pricy. i would reconsider returning.
5
Amongst the TOP-3 Steak Places - Anywhere ! Absolutely fantastic Quality, Personalised Family-Type service and settings and just superb food!

My favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore. Amazing food in a super cozy environment. Staff at the restaurant is super friendly. Highly recommended to anyone who wants good Italian food in Singapore.

Nice authentic atmosphere. Excellent service and good food. Pasta was excellent. Desserts were delicious. We were a big group (10) and everyone seemed to be enjoy themsleves.

The title ‘No menu’ isn’t strictly true as you have choice from an extensive selection but being ‘brave’ and allowing the very well informed staff to look after you is the best option. No Menu requires all dinners to embrace but if your party is less adventurous the staff will accommodate. Be brave and allow the staff to determine the menu. I did and I experienced a wonderful array of tastes which I wouldn’t otherwise experience. Great place, great food and wonderful staff. Well worth multiple visits.

Pure Mafia experience: everything is done with poor ingredients you can find in cheap supermarkets in Italy, dumped in poor dishes without any sense of beauty for presentation, and priced ridiculously expensive.The fact this restaurant still has clients is a mystery. Probably this restaurant surfed on the fact that ages ago Singaporeans did not know true Italian food and the cook is just cheating people. All the family ambiance is nice but it is really not an excuse to the price tag.The food is a shame to any Italian. Their pasta looks more like local noodles, with too much oil and spice, and very little garment. Portions are ridiculously small for their outrageous price. The overall feeling on the food is it looks ugly and taste unsatisfactory. All you are left with is a bitter taste you are ripped off with poor quality products.Entrance: I had a nice (unexpected half) Burrata overpriced at 48SGD.Main: Sea urchin home made pasta (more like small egg noodle with three three miserable sea urchin in a dishes I would not dare to feed my dog on at also 48 SGD)I did not try the wine but the wine list was looking good, yet also quite overprice. Service is good, and that's the least you could expect at that price. They also kindly offer bread, olive oil and some cake for dessert and that was nice indeed.Hope the place will seriously revamp their price and menu, challenge the lazy cook and re-invent the presentation of the dishes. The logo and window entrance look plain horrible: I don't want to see second hand shoes on candle holders when I enter a restaurant.Keeping the family ambiance, this restaurant could do way much better by simply providing the level of quality you expect for people who really care about Italian food, like we feel in restaurants like Senso, Oso, or Gattopardo that have better value for money with much better ingredients and true respect for what the client eats
5
No Menu had been highly recommended by a friend. It did not disappoint. Service was excellent as was the wine. The restaurant has a very pleasant ambience too. The food was simply fabulous. Parma Ham as a starter and Asparagus Risotto for main. Can highly recommend

Dined here with friends and were given a very warm welcome. This restaurant is owned & run by an Italian family, the decor very traditional and comfortable.The lady who takes the orders and looks after the guests is one of the family and was happy to suggest a white wine from the village / area where her family are from - it's a good recommendation and we share several bottles with our friends.We decide on the menu she suggests, the degustation menu - basically the dishes selected by the kitchen.As a gluten free diner I was happy to find out that this was not a problem as they could cater for all my needs throughout the meal.Focaccia with home made spicy sausage dip stared the meal followed by an antipasto plate containing cheese, salami, ham, tomatoes from Italy etc. all very good. The baby Calamari was again very tasty.Following on we were given pasta & risotto together on the same plate, both very good but I thought rather odd to have both served together?The main dish unfortunately was a big disappointment, belly of lamb served with just a Salad leaf and one cherry tomato. The lamb was so rare to the point that it just was not cooked at all, and being belly, was just inedible. We were a party of 8 and apart from one having fish as an alternative, none of us ate the lamb even after 2 portions headed back to the kitchen to be cooked more. It should have been very obvious to the staff that the lamb had been a major let down given that the plates were un touched, this being the case, the staff made no comment & cleared the table.Dessert was good - a small selection of several puddings and I was given a gluten free selection.We were all offered a glass of Limoncello on the house served with coffee, not sure if this was the norm or due to the inedible lamb.Overall it was a nice evening, really good food but sadly it was the awful lamb course that we all remember!
5
Been going there over the last ten years. Mainly for work related dinners and recently as a couple. The service and attention is very good. The food is excellent. I imagine no matter what you order you will enjoy. We ordered the burrata and tomato - very fresh and delicious, then pasta with lobster, then steak to share. All of the highest quality and well presented. Also had a chat with one of the owners ( family run restaurant). Ok the place is not cheap but you feel like it was money well spent after you've been there. Highly recommend.

We had a lovely evening at No Menu. We all had the "no menu" which did not meet our expectations . The food was great, but we felt that value for money was not good. Starter was perfect, cold cuts with burrata (extra charge). Then we got some pastas and risotto. With so many delicious pastas on the menu it felt a bit disappointing to get penne with tomato sauce and tagliatelle bolognese and then just a plain risotto. The main was also very disappointing. The lamb was made to perfection but it was only lamb and some salad leaves tossed in a plate. They really picked up on the desserts. So tasteful and pretty prepared. I had high expectations about No Menu, but felt it was nothing more than average. Having said that, staff is very friendly, know their food and wine and service was good. They were very helpful with providing gluten free options .I am sure I will be back but then I will probably choose my own menu
5
Write this name down NO MENU before you leave to Singapore. Great Italian restaurant, very fresh, made with care and attention. Great staff members and if you can, please ask for the manager/owner and meet her in person. Delicious food and atmosphere.
4
Very good restaurant with great family service and excellent food - although a little on the expensive side
4
Fresh food with authentic flavours. Great staff hospitality. always new specials as there is just a standard menu and specials change daily
5
A great family run restaurant with staff who are friendly, knowledgable and who have memorised the daily specials list (which is some achievement as it seems longer than the menu). They are flexible when I want something a bit different. An excellent wine list and as good for lunch as for dinner. We go there often for work and pleasure and I would warmly recommend.
4
I didn't know this restaurant even if I am quite often visiting Singapore and was introduced by a business partner and a friend. They wanted to soften my nostalgia for Italy And chose this one. As it's name says, menu is told by the young Italian metre who explains it in details. I chose a burrata and a pasta cacio e Pepe to follow, both very good. The best italian in Singapore I have been in Singapore
4
We were at No Menu for lunch and fortunately we had a reservation. It was busy and we were sent upstairs and had good aircon. Its a family restaurant, run by the dad who is also a chef, a good italian chef. Daughter, one of the waitresses knew what to promote and was quick. We had some white asparagus, cool. carpacio. I had Seafood linguine for my mains and was pleased. freshly prepared and tasty, what else can i say
5
We visit this place for business lunches and dinners as well as with friends and family because the Italian family who runs it do an incredible job and the food is excellent and never fails. The location and setting is great. Anyone who is in Singapore cannot miss out on this place, its a must try and don't forget to try grandma's cake
1
The worst dining experience I've had in a restaurant in Singapore... whether it was being shown to a table and being asked to sit when there were other guests sitting already... or when we were finally seated on the table meant for us, then to physically carry another table and put it so close to ours that an intimate dinner becomes impossible and that our conversations are not private... or when we order the asparagus without the ham or poached egg and the waiter mentions that the chef will give extra asparagus instead but nothing extra is given... or when one dish goes back almost without being touched (as it was inedible) and nobody who even bothered to ask if there was anything wrong... or we have to request the waiter's attention every time we want something and getting that attention is very tough indeed! One felt that the restaurant management & staff did you a favour by serving you. I'm not coming back here if I can help it!
5
I visit Singapore frequently and still consider this one of the best food cities in Asia. I often indulge in local cuisine but on this occasion my friend invited me to Italian. I've been to some terrific Italian restaurants but this one, near CBD, was the homiest owing to the fact that the establishment employs a number of family members. The name refers to the option to let the chef decide what you should eat, akin to omakase at a sushi restaurant. We opted for a la carte. On the recommendation of the server, the niece of the owner I think, I had the fresh burrata with parma ham and Sicilian cherry tomatoes. The freshness of the ingredients made this simple dish a standout. I was then offered a cheese gnocchi (the type of cheese escapes me at the moment) but again the quality of the ingredients made me utter unprintable sounds. The venue itself is very comfortable and made me feel like I was in someone's home... a perfect place to catch up, unrushed, with a friend. We had lovely conversations with the chef and other members of his family. I will definitely return here to try the No Menu option when next I'm back!

Have been to No Menu in the past and it was better. This time was for a quick business lunch. My colleague had the White Asparagus Risotto which he described as "bland"....and he's a vegetarian, so that's saying something!!I had the Japanese Yellow Tail fillet with spinach and mushroom. The veg was ok but the fish was overcooked and dry as a bone. Worse, the volume of brown meat (effectively pooled blood) under the skin was huge due to be overcooked didn't come away without a fight. Maybe just a bad day!
5
Food was exceptional and authentic Italian. Place was very nice and the staff are lovely, friendly, with a pleasant family family. This was our first time and sure to be back. Keep up the good work and the friendly atmosphere!
Loved it!
5
One of the best Italian restaurants anywhere. Burrata is to die for. Great, friendly family hosts. We come here a couple of times every visit to Singalore
5
I had the good fortune of trying this establishment recently but had the bad fortune of it having been a business lunch. Had this been a dinner replete with bottles upon bottles of wine, and perhaps no business talk, this would have been one of the best ever meals.Anytime a family oversees their joint, success is almost assured. Four family members interacted with our party over lunch. The effusive male cousin, Gaia the cheery and vociferous overlord of the dining room, and her parents manning the kitchen from within.When in doubt, not to worry Gaia will direct you to the order best suited to your needs. My off-the-menu carbonara knocked me off my seat. My colleagues seemed equally pleased with their respective orders.I will definitely be back, posthaste, in my next Singapore trip
5
We had a dinner for 2 on a Friday evening. Although it was busy, we had prompt and friendly service, including a chat with the main chef. The food was wonderful and the ambience made you feel like being in Italy. Would go again and would recommend highly
5
OMG i absolutely loved this place. It is like walking into a small italian town and getting taken care of with charm and passion. A whole italian family (from Piemonte) runs this place, so you get a true italian vibe the whole evening. Food was amazing
5
I went to No Menu twice at a week interval. Once I chose the "no menu" i.e. let the Chef decide, once I chose a la carte. Both time the food was superb! The service prompt and attentive. This is a family restaurant, with the Chef's wife managing the dinning room, the daughters helping with the service and you can feel it
5
This feels like you are eating in a family kitchen, where everyone in the family wants to make sure that feel like the honoured guest. Husband and wife, 2 daughters and niece/nephew all make your meal experience very special. We had No Menu recommended to us, and managed to book a table for dinner. While there is a menu, the No Menu tag comes from the offer to get the chef to prepare a meal of his recommendations of the day, with attention paid to any food allergy or preference stated. The quality, variety, presentation and customer experience are all first class
4
Love this restaurant which is a dependable, authentic and gracious Italian meal in the heart of the business/financial district of Singapore. Owned and run by an Italian family, it is like being transported to their ancestral home. Pastas are home made, wonderful anti pastas and wine selection all served with a casual air and no fuss. You feel as though you are part of la familia, no matter the occasion. Thank you

I used to be an avid fan of the pastas here for lunch, going here 2-3 times a week in 2015/16. Stopped going for about 6 months while posted overseas, and just came back yesterday to try again my favourite kurobuta pasta. Terrible. The serving size became more generous, but the flavour became super bland. The previous dish had a nice almost creamy meat sauce that was well emulsified. The dish that I got was essentially boiled pork mince on pasta. The "sauce" was as clear and as flavoursome as water, not the light grey and yellow emulsified sauce it used to have. Thank goodness that the table had tabasco and chilli flakes and pepper, otherwise it would have been an even more depressing meal. I will try again in a couple of weeks, maybe the chef was having a bad day. But I was very disappointed of what has become of my favourite lunch haunt in the past.
5
Very friendly place! Waiters from Spain, one cook from Brasil... and all the rest including food from Italy!!! Truly great! The pasta are very tasty! The burratta is great. I tasted a most special dish which was delicious... endives prepared Italian way! Just top! Do try as an EntrÃ©e, it is unique! I discovered something!Wines from Italy: just great! White and red!The service is most friendly! You will enjoy the experience!Cheers
5
I ate with a close Friend for lunch and was blown away by the quality. My risotto was covered with so much cheese and truffle for the first time in my life I did not need to ask for more. Real traditionally made it Italian at its best in Singapore. Well don
4
This is a place to pass by and enjoy a good food, wine and ambient in both places the informally corner or the main restaurant, in both the food good and well presented, a very good option to eating in Singapore, pay a visit and well rewarded, enjoy the pasta whit prawns excellent option or the beef also great a little highly priced but good.Enjoy
5
Everything was perfect. The service and the ambience. Nice wine. And great food. Starting with the excellent bread. Really nice burrata served with ham and delicious tomatoes. An assorted cold cuts - one better than the other. And then great mains. Australian Rib eye - cooked perfectly. Ravioli with Pork and beef topped with truffle. Will come back and highly recommend it. Writing the review while we are still here. So won't be able to tell you about the deserts. But looking at everything else I am sure they will be great too.
4
I had an impromptu lunch with a colleague here recently for our Christmas lunch.Food is not only good but it's also very traditional Italian. These days the fusion Italian restaurants are pretty popular so it's good to have the traditional style and done well.Service was also good and they have a decent wine selection.This place is also good for non-business meals so I will definitely be going back
5
Outstanding ambiance on a cute street. Delicious wine and cheese. A lot of yummy tapas as well. Family-run business and they're all so friendly. The daughter has a cute boutique that is meant to be great as well. I strongly recommend this place to anyone who wants authentic Italian in a romantic and fun environment
5
Was looking for something different and came across this Italian restaurant with No Menu.U only need to decide either Fish or Meat and it will serve you dishes of surprises. Food were tasty and some dishes were unique. Service was excellent, friendly & they remember what you want and don't want. Reason being, when the waitress dish out complementary appetizer while we waiting for other friends to arrive - I just pointed out to the meat and before I can complete my sentence she knew what I wanted to ask. The next waitress who came by for menu introduction said directly "Mdm, I understand from my colleague you don't take beef".. That was something which I was very impressed with. Kudos for their extra miles services. It cost more than $100 per pax but with its fresh ingredients and taste plus excellent service, it definitely worth the trip. Look forward for next surprise trip to No Menu
4
This place is worth a visit. It's not cheap but not massively expensive so good for a special meal with a loved one or if your company can foot the billMy buddy took me for lunch and I've. Wen a few times with work colleagues, clients and my Wife...She knows her food and likes her wine and loved it.The family rock and it's all genuine..I've eaten most things on the menu....top 4.5, not 5...nothing's perfect hahah
5
No Menu is a family run restaurant and they are the real deal. The menu is fantastic, the house made pasta is perfectly prepared and the wine list is great. The Ossobuco with saffron risotto is a piece of heaven. The best is the service and the chat you can have with the owner family. Thy can tell you all about what you are eating and their passion for the food really shows. I am a big fan of Italian food and spend all my summers in Italy. No Menu is really in line with the best and most authentic Italian food I have tried.
5
I had a business dinner here last week for about 20 folks. We used one of the upstairs private rooms and it was excellent. The service was excellent throughout.....attentive but also recognizing we had some business to conduct. The meal was spectacular from front to back and they were very accommodating to let us try small portions to share. As always the wine list was excellent as well
4
The place is a smallish family run restaurant. They are chatty and very welcoming. Does remind me of my fav restaurant in Italy! The degustation gives a good variety but I don't think there was anything that isn't available on the ala carte menu also. Do t forget this isn't a fine dining place in case you expect small deconstructed dishes of this and that, it's hearty Mom's Italian! The food is yummy. Bread was really good! Probably ate too much of it! Next time I'll order the lobster pasta, saw lots of plates of that come out of the kitchen, clearly popular. Place can be a little noisy, the usual chatter of a "family" restaurant. Wine pairing was pretty good with the degustation. Wines are from their home region. Chef comes to chat with you not just about the food but even about other patrons. Just note about parking- total nightmare around the area. And the website suggests parking at Tong Eng building, that was closed on sat night. So... take the mrt
5
A party of six we opted for the no menu set which is 98++, as we bought a Krug 2003 and a brunello 2004, the set was tailor to match our wines. It was a quiet Saturday dinner, the table service was exceptional.
4
Friendly, tasty, good vibe, and worth the time. While not extravagant or fancy it has a special something to it. Worth it.
4
The Italian menu is decent here, and their service is good too. Came here few times for business lunch / dinners. It's worth the price
5
Freshest ingredients flown in from Italy, the burrata is to die for. We had figs with it the last visit but today we were offered peaches as an option, they were delicious. The Parma ham and mortadella were equally great. The freshly baked bread, extra virgin olive oil served with warmth by the family really make you want to come back. Mains - sirloin steak and spinach and spicy salami risotto highly recommended.The creme brûlée was not the best we have eaten but the Gianduja mascarpone dessert is simply fantastic. We also got to sample the green apple cake and meringue - very very good!Love the service, the cozy decor, this is is easily our favorite restaurant in Singapore
1
We previously had good experience in the restaurant so wanted to go back again for a romantic dinner. We were really disappointed by the service. We didnt feel we were given attention at all. When we were trying to engage with the young italian guy who were attending to us, we were greeted by cold response. The only attention we got was from the kind server who kept filling our water glasses and clearing our finished plates. The rest of the family who owned the restaurant didnt care too much if we were there or not even though we were sitting close to the reception table on the ground floor. We decided we would not go back to the place anymore and would not recommend to any of our guests / business associates to dine at the restaurant. Food is not too bad but service was cold
5
We found this place by accident while wandering down boon tat street and I'm so glad we did. It was the best Italian meal I've had in years. The quality of ingredients and portion size were all perfect. The complimentary focaccia and mortadella ham were a welcome surprise (very nice olive oil). The pork ragu pasta and beef cheeks were incredible. A good wine list that is not too pricey by Singapore standards (though will feel expensive if you are coming from Europe). Friendly and helpful staff including the family who own the restaurant - they made good recommendations and were knowledgeable about the wines.The decor is lovely, really as if you are in someone's home but still intimate.This was a real treat and I would certainly return next time I visit Singapore
5
The "No Menu" restaurant has indeed a menu. However the out of the menu options are extensive and hard to remember! Finally Patricia, the Cook's (Oswaldo) wife helped us out making our choices. We had as appetizers the buffala with ham and the clams and mussels with white wine. Everything imported from Italy and you can tell the quality is definitely different to what we are used in Singapore for Italian food.As Martin's we had some lobster pasta, t-bone steak and canneloni. All of them delicious.The restaurant is run by the family including since nephews and all of them are lovely.Prices are a bit on the higher end, but I rather pay a bit more and get the quality rather than in many Italian restaurants here where you pay a lot just because it's Italian.The place is cozy and in a very vivid area for dining in Singapore, in Chinatown, with plenty of restaurants and places for after hours drinks.
5
Cosy atmosphere, absolutely lovely staff, very lively and enthusiastic. The food was superb and abondant. For our gluten free friends (like me), this is so far the restaurant with the best GF options I have found. GF focaccia was superb, GF pastas are also to die for.A gem in an area where overpriced mediocrity seems to be the rule... well done
5
We have been taken to the restaurant by one of our business contacts for a business lunch.The place is very nice with classy design. We have been sitting on the second floor.The food is great with lots of choices from traditional Italian menu. Waitresses were very friendly and helpful.Would highly recommend the place
4
Went there to celebrate friends' birthday. Food was great, you can customised your menu, just tell them what you don't eat, and your budget and you will be given the choice of the main menu. They also do set lunch menuAs it is family run, the staff are all very friendly and even the boss himself who is also the chef will drop by to say hello if he has the time

Zucchini flowers with ricotta on a bed of tomato coulis
Handmade pasta with chanterelle in a light cream sauce
Good sized portions, both excellently done
First time I was seated upstairs which has a warm, cosy ambience

One of the best experience in Singapore regarding the Italian food ! Run by a real 100% Italian family , offer really high quality food in a magic Italian warm atmosphere ! Must try in Singapore ! Buon appetito!

This is a fantastic and ever green place for business lunch. The ingredients are very fresh and serving staff very professional.

3rd visit and every time we went we had a better experience , takes you several visits to get the best out of this unique experience , extremely well looked after by a wonderful family
5
There is nothing bad I can say about the gorgeous restaurant, from the moment you walk in you feel like you are eating at Nonna's kitchen table, the family who run this restaurant are helpful, welcoming and the food is delicious. This little hide away on boon tat street is a must.... Bon Apetit

We have dined here many times and we keep coming back for more. We are big fans of burrata cheese and the burrata here is the best in Singapore. It is served with rocket leaves, parma ham, tomatoes and white peach - the mix / combination of flavours makes it seem that you are having 2 appetisers instead of 1. The burrata itself is smooth and creamy, lightly seasoned with olive oil and salt and pepper. The standard serving is a little large for 2 to share but just right to stop a fight if you're both fans of burrata.We shared the lamb ragu pasta for our main and the serving size left us very full (after finishing the burrata for starter) without any room for dessert. I would definitely order the lamb ragu pasta again - the lamb was really tender and so full of flavour.Aside from the excellent food, the thing that makes this restaurant stand out is the warm service. It is family run and, no matter how busy they are, the wait staff make time to chat to you and tell you more about the food. Their passion for food really comes through and gets you really excited about the meal you're about to enjoy
5
I always love this restaurant, the place I always go when I visit Singapore. An experience of a truly Italian family restaurant, the Chef the boss, his wife the real boss, the niece the restaurant manager and the choice of truly authentic Italian food with an outstanding choice of great Italian wines, not necessarily expensive. Without hesitation a place to go, to come back and to enjoy fully
4
I had a perfect vitello tonato as starter . I guess I can safely state that this must be the best one in an action radius of 5000km. As main I had the sea bass . Honestly cooked , fresh , crispy skin . Service is warm and authentic . Will denier go back
5
WOW is the best way to describe this Italian restaurant on Boon Tat street. An absolute awesome restaurant, great service, great atmosphere, the food is perfect with something for every taste and every appetite. The wine list is superb. if you are looking for a great night out where you want everything to be perfect this is the place. take your time enjoy the friendly atmosphere and enjoy your food and wine

I know I gave a good review the last time I was here. But the chef seems to have e changed, or something terrible has happened there. The hostess is friendly as ever, but Food is really really terrible now.Garlic Prawns were overcooked and pedestrian. The Cannelloni was so ordinary that it made me nauseous..and I wasted half of it. The Fish was also an ordinary hunk of fish, fried and slapped on a pile of unappealing vegetables. Sorry guys, you have lost your touch ! Never again. I felt cheated of this afternoon.The atmosphere was great, and the hostess super friendly and all that...but Bankers beware....don't take clients out there. They will not be impressed !!AVOID
5
As a family of four we ate at No Menu. The food was excellent quality. The chef was friendly and spoke to us about his homemade focaccia and pasta. Overall a really good meal in a nice location. The BEST lemon tart and tiramisu.
5
Went for a quick business dinner.
I had a great roast beef salad, thinly sliced rare beef with rocket.
Then pasta, cooked just right.
Many complementary items arriving to taste.
Great service too.
Highly recommend and will go back.

Friendly Italian staff team, traditional food. The environment is very cozy and the food delicious. Ordered the withe aspargus with black truffle and the traditional burrata to start. Tried the simple pasta with black truffle. Awesome. Deserts are good too

It's easy to miss this restaurant . The signage 'no menu' is stuck on the glass door - you would just think that it's the menu and not the name of the restaurant !The restaurant looked crowded from the outside . We were pleasantly surprised to be led upstairs to a v cosy room with 5 tables . The decor is welcoming and inviting . The menu is extensive . The service staff we had was most friendly and knowledgeable - quite uncommon in restaurants these days . We had ravioli and arrabiatta penne that were fresh and flavourful . It was a nice surprise to be given little complimentary desserts at the end .I was surprised that there was no lunch set at the restaurant as it is common in this area. This makes No Menu somewhat pricier than the rest . But the quality of the food and service makes up for it . I was told that this restaurant is run by the chef and his family members - I can feel the warmth in the food !
5
A quirky, unusual Italian with food of the highest order and an eclectic interior. The head waitresses have the longest specials menu in history memorised every day. I have got into the habit of ignoring the menu and go for the specials every time - it hasn't failed me yet. And surprise surprise, there is a menu...
5
The idea of " no menu" works well. The service is great, staff knowledgeable about their food and the Piedmont region where the owners come from. Great wine variety and menu keeps changing and always very good. Have been there four times over three years visits to Singapore. Well worth it.
5
We stumbled on this place on Boon Tat Street while scouting places near our hotel, & were a bit hesitant about having Italian food in Singapore when there were still so many places to try for their chicken rice, laksa, char kuey teow, bak kut teh, roti prata, etc... but the family & staff were so friendly despite our interrupting their pre-dinner waitstaff instructions that we immediately felt at home!As you might infer from the restaurant's name, you should be prepared to put yourself in the chef's hands (c.f. "omekase" for sushi chefs), but we were rewarded with a wonderful 10 course degustation menu that left us very satisfied, but not over-stuffed. As other reviewers have mentioned, even the focaccia was exceptionally light & savory, but we heeded the chef/owner's admonition, "don't eat too much of the bread", because the meal itself was outstanding. We started with an appetizer plate that was vivid to both eye & palate (Parma ham w/ canteloupe, burrata w/ a flavorful Roma tomato, bruschetta & mortadella - photo attached), then had a delightful pasta course comprising 3 contrasting dishes (please see photo) - "just like when my mother had leftovers & we'd each get a little bit of each" according to the chef. Mains were equally delightful, as were the homemade desserts. Coffee & grappa concluded a thoroughly delightful meal - particularly enhanced by the friendly & charming staff. We'll be back
5
Been here a couple of times for lunch before and this was first dinner visit. As we were a big party we had a set menu with choice of main course. Quality was very good. Delicious paella with green asparagus. Will definitely be back for another visit. Check the prices first so you are happy to pay for the quality.
4
Firstly, there is a menu but a very extensive and interesting specials menu that is read off at the table. The food was pretty tasty. As a group of 7 we shared 2 burrata and Parma ham starters plus some roast beef. Both recommendations by the staff. Then a main dish each. I had double helping of Burrata with Burrata and tomato ravioli main. Again very nice. The tiramisu dessert was very creamy and easily big enough for 2 to share, or 4 in our case. The restaurant had a nice ambiance.
5
And oh.. The OLIVE OIL and focaccia..... To die for. This family run restaurant is as good as it gets if you want a taste of Italy. Everything we had was delicious. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. I'm going back to try the T-bone next ..
4
I went there with my wife and ordered the chef's menu. Had a very nice evening and will come back...
3
Their starter (parma ham with cheese and tomatoes) is really nice. This is a must order dish if you like cheese. We order 2 pasta, not that fantastic. Hoping to try lobster pasta but not available. Their dessert is nice too.. we ordered chocolate truffle.It's abit over price for pasta which easily cost more than $30. We ordered 2 pasta, 1 starter and 1 dessert without any wine, and it cost us around $170 for 2 pax
3
I paid $35 ++for a bowl of pasta with some cheese on top. And $22 ++ for a green salad. Meals were ok, but far too expensive, I couldn't see the value compared with other Italian restaurants in Singapore. Owner/chef said hello etc which was nice as its a family restaurant but then one of the daughters was schooling a new staff member near our table which was a bit on the nose
5
Like many good european restaurants in Singapore, tucked away in a tight little old chinese shop built in the first half of the last century, this Italian little gem boasts little of its architecture, like so many new designer restaurants are wont to do. It boasts instead of its ingredients flown in from the motherland itself. The food was excellent - as expected. But what was exceptionally remarkable was the first-press olive oil that was served with the very warm, fresh-out-of-the-oven focaccia: if you never understood olive oil, this will change your mind and your palate. The authenticity of the restaurant extends to the service - while the Italian waitresses had the same hand-waving friendliness of those you would find in Rome or Naples, they also had the same relaxed Mediterranean speed of bringing in dishes and clearing up empty plates. Which was not necessarily bad - as it adds to the experience but perhaps a bit surprising only because being in Singapore, I was used to military-style level of service. The burrata was exceptionally creamy - if you have nothing else, have that. For the mains, I had the rib eye which was superbly done. The panna cotta dessert was a bit harder than I would have preferred but still rich and creamy enough to be quite enjoyable
5
Amazing service Friendly and attentive waitresses and waiters! I have gone there 4 times already and would go there again and again for their great burrata cheese! The recipes are genuinely Italian and the owners import most of their ingredients straight from Italy They would serve you complementary stuff and engage with you for a good conversation Very home like feeling when we go there! What more does an expat need
5
Just like its name sake, there's no menu offered as the chef will only prepare from the fresh ingredients they source every morning. The regular goers and now friends to the chef will tell them what they feel like having and it will be prepared and cooked with the usual Italian passion.It's okay if one is unsure, the Italian Chef daughter will guide you through to ensure your romantic date or your dinner guests will have a truly enjoyable meal. My personal favorite would be their antipasto, vongole, pasta and sea bass. And always, always make room for their home made tiramisu that is to die for.And to wash it all down and helps with digestion with a few rounds of limoncello on the house. Best of all is if you have some great wine, do bring it along. The restaurant does not charge any corkage as they understand and their goal is to make you feel at home and to kill you with their good food.I will be heading there again very soon..
1
My guest had the steak special it was delivered way over cooked and it was sent back. I had the Arrabiatta which was disgusting and I should have sent it back. It was uncooked Penne floating in tomato juice with a couple of coarse cut red chilli floating in there. Never again. One star only given so I could write this review
5
Best Italian cuisine we ever had. Our son booked this restaurant, and despite the NO MENU name, their menu had a wide range of lovely Italian food. The 3 ladies running the restaurant, were charming, very knowledgeable and extremely friendly. Will be there again in October. If you ever visit Singapore, don't miss this restaurant
5
Some of the best Italian cuisine I've ever had. Despite the name of the restaurant, there is a menu for those less adventurous. But for the braver sort, you can opt to let the chef surprise you with special creations. Not to worry, though - they ask beforehand about allergies and preferences, and they are so careful that when I said I don't like squid, they replaced the squid ink risotto with something else that was delicious, but I wish they had asked me before denying me the risotto or that I had been clearer that I don't like the texture of squid and that squid ink though is fine (I tried some of my spouse's and it was wonderful). The wine and desserts were great, as was the service.The main dining room was comfortable, with warm, pleasantly cozy feel.If you go, I'd recommend you make reservations. It was packed on the week-day night we visited
5
Friends suggested the place to us during our short stopover in Singapore. We were not disappointed. We booked, just in case, but it was midweek after Christmas and not full. From the start the service treated you like family or old friends and we immediately relaxed into the atmosphere, just like in Italy. The family hail from Piedmont - Alessandria in fact and as we had been there the year before we had something to talk to the owner about. She introduced us to some really superior olive oil with lashings of bread and as soon as it was finished another took its place. In the end we had to stop eating it or dinner would have been a non-starter. We had a starter of burrata and figs (I think I had soup which was not charged for) followed by tagliatelli lamb ragu and duck and finished with a gianduja (a sweet chocolate spread containing about 30% hazelnut paste, invented in Turin in 1796), expresso, fernet branca and tea. All was superb. However, this was not the end as the owner insisted we had a portion and then another of the dessert cake famous in this restaurant. Indeed, we ended up eating more that we did not pay for than what we did. We don't drink alcohol so only a bottle of Pellegrino meant that the total price for two was SD 220. In my view, a small price to pay for such a meal in such a restaurant. I will return on all future trips to Singapore
4
The food is, in fact, the most delicious italian dishes i had in Singapore. The service is very good, feels like family and welcomed...
Price is steep but worth every penny. Their bread and the special olive oil from Sicily are to die for!
4
Thanks guys, a feel good home grown Italian feed. Very authentic, no pretense, great service, great wine. Loved the waiters who knew the specials back the front and were passionate. Will be back
5
Family run shop with amazing food. Great specials every day. Recommend for a long business lunch. Great location in the CBD so very convenient.
4
A lovely family run restaurant with warm, charming and very Italian service. The freshly baked focaccia, premium olive oil are a start of things to come. This is a quality establishment where they use excellent ingredients, with real care and attention given to the food.I've been many times and there isn't a single dish I can fault. The Burrata is a true stand out in my opinion.What stops me giving 5 stars is the price at No Menu. I know Singapore is expensive but this place cannot be described as value for money. Went as a couple having two courses each and a cheaper bottle of wine which set us back SGD 320
5
No Menu is really close to my office and I've been here twice now. Absolutely love the place, the service and the food. Definitely one of the best in Singapore.The food and service is warm, lovely and personalized.I highly recommend the Burrata and Tiramisu. Do not miss it
5
The place had been there for the longest time. The menu is very completed with most Italian dishes. Love the freshly baked focciata and olive oil. I ordered the seafood soup that comes in clams, shrimps and mussels in a tomatoe based broth, very tasty and yummy.
5
This place is fab. I love the food, the ambience, the staff, the family. I go for lunch normally and then went for a Special dinner last week.....was worth paying total $1000 for 4 people, including 3 bottles of wine. We had the 'no menu' 6 courses (i lost count).....and it was brilliant. fantastic
5
Yes that's exactly what it feels like. The owner/ daughter duo are so friendly and helpful, and all the menu selection by them and the way they serve your courses with the perfect pairing of wines, you never feel the time spent over thereConvenient location, close to CBD - great Italian food, paired with great wines, and talks with the owners, a very home cooked experience, and the insistence of why you should have the dish was just a superlative experienceNot at all crowded, despite being a small place and also home like setting - I recommend it to the hilt. Go and experience undulated Italian hospitality - Its worth it
5
Didn't expect to be eating here, but we were attracted by the cozy ambience and menu. Yes, they do have a menu despite their name. We were served warmly and efficiently by the chef's wife and daughter. We tried the prawn pasta, spinach tortellini and tiramisu. Ingredients were very fresh, pastas all home made and cooked to perfection. Great dining experience and happy to have dined there
4
The warmth of the owner and her daughter, the wonderful service, the delicious high quality home-cooked-style meals, the careful knowledgeable selection of fine wines, the cozy atmosphere of a lively Italian restaurant (yet it doesn't impose on your privacy) - these qualities are now too hard to find and comes by far in between.The whole team works hard together and offers the best fine dining service that is hard to beat in Singapore.We failed to make a reservation and took our chances on a Friday night - at the peak hour-sitting. They were packed and when all seems to have no chance at all - a very kind, sweet staff managed to find us one last table for two. The effort and kindness and just the polite manner he displayed is exceptional. This would not have happened in other restaurants. More likely than not - in others, we would've been made to feel like 'desperados' to beg for a table and would've been brushed off with arrogance.So to finish off - No Menu has been operating successfully for years and is popular with genuine local and international foodies (not just bloggers!) for proven reasons.Well done to the team at No Menu for bringing authenticity back to life
5
Operated by owner/chef from Italy, this is THE only restaurant we regularly return to. This is a place you can go with the family, take business guests - or enjoy on a date night.
5
Recently met a client here for dinner and as always the food and the service were excellent. Wine list also continues to impress with a great selection from Italy. Always a go to place when in Singapore and it delivered again.
4
Almost entirely Family-run, this place serves very good and earthy Italian food.
Clearly family owned and therefore slightly tackiy and unprofessionally decorated, the place makes up with its excellent food and friendly family waiters at the table.
Recommend for un-fancy, perfect, at-home Italian !
5
Never disappointed by No Menu, the food is delish, Osvaldo and his family make you feel like your part of his. I always leave with a smile on my face and in my stomach.
5
My review is long overdue having visited in August 2015. This was where we were introduced to real Burrata amongst many other Italian delicasies. The home made pasta is exceptional. What a journey to heaven and back!! Service was excellent, food incredible - a tiny piece of Italy tucked away in Singapore which was more authentic than Italy itself! We are very sad that our time in Singapore has come to an end and it is unlikely that we will get to revisit this wonderful restaurant again. There are many fantastic eateries in the city but if you miss this one you have missed a real treat
4
I've had the good fortune of eating food cooked by the No Menu team at a private function at someone's home and I remember the food being very good. It was an Italian menu, simple dishes but everything tasted goodRecently I went to their restaurant for dinner not realising it was the same team. We sat in the private dining area on the first floor and the decor made me feel like I was in an old house somewhere in Italy, sitting in someone's dining room. Very quaint and homely We started off with some appetisers - fresh Sicilian tomatoes and spicy salami on bread. This was followed by a big serve of beautiful burrata, more Sicilian tomatoes and peaches with red wine. I had probably the best focaccia I have ever had dipped in first press olive oil with a lovely green colour. For mains I was told that white truffles were still in season and so I opted for pasta with shaved truffles. And followed it up with gianduja for dessert. All accompanied with some excellent wines and finished with refreshing limoncello! What a meal! Simple dishes but great flavours. Absolutely Unforgettable!
4
A great little place with fantastic food, nice surprises along the way and a lovely atmosphere that would suit many occasions. They have a great range of specials also which was great however made the selection more difficult. I can see why people go back :
4
I have eaten here quite a few times. The location is excellent for lunches within the CBD - not quite in the middle, yet close enough to walk. It's the best place in Singapore if you want Italian food for a business lunch. The food is excellent, price is OK (typically S$80-100 per person), service is prompt and ambience is "homey"
4
Only been here once for a quick business lunch. I was struck then what a quaint restaurant it was and also what a decent meal it was. Have always been keen to try it again. Finally it happened today and luckily too as I walked past the shophouse entrance the first time round. Really enjoyed the food and the very nice ambience and good service upstairs. The meal was suggested by our waitress and it was truly great. I highly recommend No Menu
5
Being Italian in Singapore I love to go back to Italy from time to time ... even better if I don't need to travel! Going to No Menu for a dinner is like entering Italy without using the passport ... the warm welcome, the friendliness of Osvaldo, Patrizia and the girls, the great and fresh Italian food. Simple recipes, very tasty and genuinely Italian.
4
Best Italian we have had in SGP.
Wine is on the pricy side - but one has to get accustomed to this in SGP.
Service is always wonderful, food is always fresh and tasty.
5
Been to No Menu twice. Absolutely superb experience. The food is outstanding - prepared with lots of love. Had the burrata with figs and Sicilian tomatoes - absolutely sensational. The ribeye is easily the best steak I have had in Singapore. The entire family pitches in and makes the experience really terrific. Very special place
5
I had no idea where our friends were inviting us, and when I knew that the place was called No Menu, I found it quite funny.This was a great italian food restaurant.It starts with bruschetta just warm that you dip into a delicious extra olive oil from SIcily. Then I was absolutely delighted with the buratta - just delicious. I followed with spaghetti with squid ink - marvellous; and it seems that the ink risotto is as good (but slightly spicy). I ended with the unavoidable tiramisu which was unsurprisingly very good.The wine results a bit pricey, but nothing surprising when you are in Singapore.I was about to forget the staff - the place is run by a family, and everybody is involved - very friendly, very welcoming, very... italian :-) We loved itA final tip, if you book a bit in advance, avoid the room on the upper floor, the one downstairs is much more charming and you can have a quick look at the kitchen and the cooks 
2
Service: ok... but not to the level you would expect in a place this expensiveDecoration: a "trattoria"; the tables were well setThe food: unsatisfactory; we ordered the burrata and it was ok but the portion was even smaller than what we get in Hong Kong, then came the main courses. My guest had ordered a risotto with seafood and it looked more like a seafood soup (way, way too liquid). I was advised to take "spaghetti with nero di seppia" (spaghetti with squids and their ink) and they were not good: the squids were not fresh (easy to tell by the texture).The bill was very high, I guess because of the wine (no bottle, by the glass).Very overrated, there are better, less pompous Italian places in Singapor
4
We went here on our first night in Singapore. The food is of a good quality, delicious and fresh. What was a shock here was the bill. It was exorbitant. We ordered burrata as an entree to share amongst 4 people, and out comes 4 serves, small plates at $25 each. Wine is very pricey too. I probably wouldn't go back here despite the food being good as I can get the same quality at much better value
5
A family run genuine Italian restaurant with ingredients sourced directly from Italy.A simple standard menu but delicious and fresh specials that are bursting with flavour and innovative touches.The wines are also sourced from local villages across different regions from Italy and accompany the food perfectly.The owner and head chef makes a friendly and relaxed atmosphere that is an utter joy
1
Simply terrible all round, don't believe the hype this place is shocking. I went there for a business lunch and two of our main courses were un-edible swimming in oil and tasteless. The service was matter of fact, they didn't care that we had left half our food. The decor is oldie-worldie and not impressive.One of the worst Italian restaurant's in Singapore
3
Food was above par but the pricing was kinda exorbitant . Service was above average . But couldn't digest the fact that i needed to pay close to 250 dollars for 3 just for a starter and a main . Definitely over priced . would return only for a sponsored mea
5
Really a great experience! Love the simplicity if the food and the amazing tastes. Lived and worked in Italy and being at this restaurant feels like you are in a real italian restaurant in Taormina Sicely! Great friendly people and amazing kindness and service.Highly recommended for all visitors and ex pats in Sgp
5
If you are looking for an authentic Italian restaurant in Singapore - no menu is your choice. Here's why:- delicious food --> fresh Italian tomatoes, superb ravioli filled with burrata, tender lamb shank, nice pizza bread and good tiramisu- one amuse bouche at the beginning (some salami and tomatoes on toasted bread)- one amuse bouche at the end (pre-dessert: cake with merengue)- super friendly service: we ordered the Amarone 2011, got the 2003 served instead. We only found the mistake after half the bottle and told the waitress. They let us finish the exquisite red wine but charged the one from 2011. We even got a free tiramisu in addition - WOW- great Amaretto and Espresso to finish the dinnerWe can definitly recommend this place and we will come back for sure :
4
I had lunch here with 2 friends. I arrived early and admired the attractive decor while waiting for my friends. The food was delicious and the service was friendly, but a bit slow.
5
Enjoyable family run restaurant that serves authentic Italian dishes and actually has a menu. Not the place for fine dining but excellent for hearty home inspired meals.
5
Wow, no menu offers best Italian in south east Asia hands down... Let them take care of you and let the good food roll out. Amazing wine and desserts and the courses just keep coming. Highly recommend!
5
I had a business dinner at No Menu while in Singapore. It was outstanding. It is a small, comfortable place made more comfortable by the excellent service and attentiveness. It was very easy to carry on a conversation. The burrata cheese was outstanding as was the spinach and garlic. I cannot give this restaurant high enough praise.
4
they are accommodating. they followed up with our requests till we were satisfied. actually it was organized for my wife's gathering of all her previous staff which she worked with the last 2o more years. the lady (daughter of owner Osvaldo) Gaia i believe is nice and charming and very well organized to please as best as she could. the others were equally helpful to as we were a big crowd. we have been to this restaurant a few times and usually organized by friends of about a groups size of 8 each time. this time we had 24 persons and it was still fabulous with Gaia's charm and lovely smile all the way. they even accommodated our late leaving as we drank and partied. thanks Gaia !!
4
the setting- upstairs- is as if you were in someones home- family portraits and bookshelves and wine and books displayed... the food is authentic italian, it has good range of wines . we were in a group with varied food needs- and they catered to all of the variations attentively . this is home style italian .nice and relaxe
5
I really like this place. The service is good and attentive and the food is delicious. Great for business or social lunches or dinners. The specials seem to be the same most times you come here but you can always find something good. Would recommend this place!
3
It's been a few years since I last eat here. I remembered the food were more spectacular. This time I had lunch and is quite disappointed. Just very ordinary Italian fare, almost like the quality of a chain restaurant. I probably won't visit again given the no lack of good Italian restaurant in Singapore.
5
We were there with some friends last week. We had heard mixed eviews of the place, so had gone with no expectation. This family run restaurant was a dream. We were encouraged to go for the taster's menu, and we all enjoyed every dish. For us, the portions became too much, and by the time the main arrived, we were full, and felt we could not do justice to the dish. But it was an excellent meal and we would go back there again
5
Despite the fact they call themselves "No Menu", they have wide range of food and also today's specials.I tend to like the today's special, however, sometimes they can be a little more expensive.Pasta are delicious and also the choices for the first plate and deserts are wonderful. I have never been disappointed by their offerings. Staffs are very friendly and carry "Italian" heritage. If you like Italian food, "No Menu" in Singapore is a place you must visit. Located in CBD and quite easy to access
4
Those Sicilian prawn and tomatoes were the best.. with that very soft cheese?? I just forgot the name...not listed in the menu? No Menu? ;)
5
very good and charming Italian restaurant owned by an beautiful Italian family.
can't be disappointed...
place to eat if you are nostalgic about Europe.
Good olive oil, food and vin

A very strong recommend if you are looking for authentic Italian dishes served by warm waitstaff in a buzzy environment. I have been several times and personal highlights include the burrata and tomatoes (I assume they're flown from Italy because that's the only place I've tasted such wonderful tomatoes) and hand-made pastas. Meats and desserts are also excellent. What I think really sets this place apart are its owners--an Italian family that are warm and considerate. Last night there was a small confusion with something on our bill and it was handled immediately, and with considerable grace. The kind of effort, after a delicious meal, that makes you resolved to come back as soon as possible. It's not an inexpensive meal but I think, for Singapore, it's decent value. There are other good Italian restaurants here, Valentino springs to mind, but this is our favourite. And a Top 3 spot in the city
4
I went to No Menu for the 2nd time last night and again it was great! The food is so good and again we had great service.Singapore is not the cheapest place to go for dinner but I don't think No Menu is overpriced at all. The appetizers are a bit on the expensive side but the mains are well priced and so are the desserts. No need to talk about wine.....this is expensive wherever you go in Singapore but 88 dollars for a great bottle of Chianti is fine with me.Good service, no pushy waiters, in fact I had to ask for a second bottle of wine. Will def go back there.Tip: go upstairs; less noisy and really nice 'homely' feeling
5
This is by far my favorite western restaurant in Singapore. It is Italian, owned and operated by an authentic Italian and his family.Don't confuse this with the No Menu Bar down the street. They are both in Boon Tat St but the 'bar' was sold some time ago and, although charming, doesn't serve good food. The restaurant is at a totally higher level.I recommend the 'surprise' multi course fixe-prix menu, but there's an extensive ala carte menu as an oxymoronic feature. Great wine list as well.A unique place with warm personalized service, quirky, comfy decor, quiet and ... most of all DIVINE food
5
We had a fantastic time at No Menu Kitchen (not to be confused with the nearby cafe) where everything from the chef to the waiters is Italian. The "surprise menu" was certainly the right choice and went really well with a bottle of Barollo. I will come back
4
2 thumbs up for the quality of food here. Been here a handful of times and i have never been disappointed. I wouldn't be able to comment on all of their items of their menu as I have always been ordering the same main whenever I am there - which is their spag. I have tried alot of different spags from different restaurants (in Singapore and from several other countries, but unfo.. never been to Italy) and I would say their spag, in my point of view, is definitely one of the best (at least to me) in Singapore. the setback of the place is the price though. it is actually a little pricier as compared to the rest of the restaurants in the vicinity. overall, No Menu is just a little short of perfection due to the pricetag, but if price isn't that much of a concern to you, and if you so happened to be a big fan of spag (esp aglio olios) like myself, then you should pay this place a visit

Love the food here! Freshly cooked Italian food. Chirpy and vibrant atmosphere which is nice. Very cosy as it was full when we came in and got the not too nice table right by the main entrance. They did offer us prosseco as an apology which was thoughtful.I can see that parking will be a problem during office hours as although we came for dinner on a weekend it is still a little tricky.Otherwise, definitely recommend

I wanted to entertain my family who have recently taken up residence in Singapore and this restaurant was recommended. Frankly the food was mediocre - I had mussels and what were alleged to be scallops but were actually small clams which were seriously overcooked. Around the table I could not see anything distinctively Italian that we could not have knocked up at home.The prices made the eyes water. 5 people with in bottle of wine and one mineral water came to around SG$ 700. There just has to be better value in Singapore!In summary, give it a miss

By far the best restaurant i have been to in Singapore. Family owned and family run, evident from its top notch service to great food. Only time it gets crowded is during Valentines Day i've observed twice...and it can have a somewhat of a cafeteria feel, especially when they make couples wait outside in line and then call out their names loudly ( for those who have reserved) and then bring them upstairs for seating

Food was good.
Near Lau Pasat food centre, where you can find a great selection of local food.
Nothing to rave about, waiter was far too pushy and trying to sell anything expensive on the menu, not my type of restaurant at all
5
Great service from great team.. from the moment you arrives till depart... the food is heavenly good..!!! Must try the tiramisu..!!! Mylene, she is the GEM..!!!
3
Food was very good, ambience was pleasant, however I got a very nasty shock when the bill came. Be very careful what you order or make sure someone else is paying!

I had this restaurant recommended by a friend who used to live in Singapore and was very excited about checking it out.I had lunch alone, and dinner with a colleague in one day, and the overall impression is ok, but not great.The lunch was inexpensive, tasty and generous, but nothing to really applaud wildly - for dinner we had a starter of Burata and ham, shared a generous helping which was great, but expensive and for maincourse fried chicken, again not anything out of the ordinary.Wine is expensive in Singapore, but I believe the price they charge at No Menu is average.The service and ambience is great, and sitting in the arcade with pedestrian traffic one inch from your chair is great
2
Im sure their ridiculous over embellished accents was an attempt to distract us from the cheap prosciutto they were selling as iberico ham. I didn't complain as I am tired of complaining at substandard meals/ service in Singapore. This place looked like it could know better, it did not!! they up sold mediocre of menu starters for $45 for more than a main although nothing on the menu was close to that range and my pasta was undercooked
4
I have been for dinner to No Menu on quite a few occasions. I avoid the weekends as they have a two seating policy which i don't like.I have never has a bad meal, the high quality of the food has been consistent.The restaurant is family run and the owner and his wife are very warm and welcoming. I've read a number of reviews mentioning "pushy" tactics. I cant say i've experienced that although their specials do include lobster linguine and truffle based dishes....both are usually expensive in any restaurant. One of the daughter's is the somelier and she is very knowledgeable about wine and especially the wines that they serve.The owner takes great pride in the food that is served and he's always got time to stop and chat, often with a plate of delicious tit bits...and free lah! Seriously though its these small things that make us go back time and time again
2
It has happened the second time with me... First time we were 9 of us and ended taking the appetisers as recommended by the waiter because she was simply too pushy. We ended up with collosal amount of food and a whopping 1.2k plus bill without wine or desert! Last time I was there this saturday and again the same story pushy waiters trying to insist you should take the expensive tasting menu or even expensive items from the ala-carte menu. My whole question is why? Your food tastes good, your ingredients are good quality but your waiters spoil the overall experience completely!! Please please don't do this anymore
4
Although they do have a menu (hmmm) the off menu offerings in this place are always worth a tryI've been a couple of times and the family never really disappoint, we've seen them move from location to location over the years so nice to see they are successful in this current venturepersonally I stick to traditional Italian and you can be sure that the flavours are authentic ad honestA good and reasonable wine list is always a positive, especially in Singaporeusually pretty full, this is a favourite Italian and a favourite in Singapore where you don't feel ripped off like so many other placesI still think Pasta Brava is one of the best value honest Italian restaurants but this too is homely, friendly and great foo

I came here for the 5course "no menu". A surprise menu. They asked us if we want meat or fish version, we had chosen the meat version, but the dish #2 was clams. Too bad I was pregnant and my friend was allergic so we could not have it. I am surprised that they do not ask us if we have any allergies/food restriction before.I was disappointed by the meat (beef cheek) that was not very fine, very fatty. (I had come another evening and had Osso Bucco that was recommended to me by a friend: not very nice either, same problem with meat: very fatty, not in a good way).However, the burrata was always excellent, as well the accompanying tomatoes and ham.I would come back just for the burrata and italian tomatoes.Service is ok, but we noticed waiters were a bit rude when interrupting our conversation to present the dishes: they made us feel like the whole table had to shut down to listen to them describe the dish.$$ We got a shock when bill came, due to wine. The 5 course menu price is still ok but the wine+grappa more than doubled the price per pax
5
amazing food, service team and atmosphere not too crowded ~ really in love with pasta seafood & their risotto ~the freshness of their ingredients made each dishes has the best of best *superb* it is overpriced but good food & good quality food comes in a price to pay in a CBD location isn't :)Mylene isn't one of your amazing service with passion staff! thumb up for u! In service line for this years~ isn't easy to get our good feedback :
5
Loved it, great starters, very Italian service and unique.
It was fast and professional. I loved the fish dish and the steak I had.
A bit pricy though but worth it the money.
5
This is the second time I've been here. The service, food and wine have been consistently good. It's a bit pricey (approx 50sgd per person) but definitely worth the splurge from time to time.
4
Singapore is incendiary expensive but a recent lunch was just too much for me and my business partner. I mean a 60$ starter!
5
Lovely little bistro done in proper italian style great service and amazing food.. Staff are top class and even managed to get us a taxi fast even with the Singapore rain making it difficult to track one down. I will be back.
4
We went here for a quick work lunch at the restaurant as we needed a place in the area. Service was efficient and homely. The decor is not flashy. The meals came quickly and were generally good. We managed to get out of the restaurant quickly before the crowd which we wanted. We ordered a la carte - my colleagues ended up with some great tomato mozzarella salads and we each had a main. Overall not bad
5
No Menu is a cosy Italian restaurant tucked away on Boon Tat Street adjacent to many new eateries and watering holes nearby. The food is excellent and service was good as well. You can go with the ala carte menu or like the name of the restaurant have one of the specials whereby something is served up for you by the Chef. I must say that I was not expecting much when my spouse brought me here but I left pleasantly surprised. One little gripe is that the lighting is rather dark. Price wise it is reasonably high but that comes with the territory. If you want something less formal you can try the bar restaurant from the same establishment just down the street
2
We booked No Menu for a celebration, hoping for a special family night out. While the food was excellent, the service was extraordinarily patchy. Appetisers were brought out before we'd even sipped the pre-dinner drinkies. Our drinks were constantly topped up and the owner dropped by for a brief chat, but in general, we got the impression from the other staff that we were impinging on their time. Distracted, vague and curt and though it's a small thing, we were not even noticed as we left. Made me feel like the hired help, creeping out the back door.And for the gasp-inducing cost of just under $800 for 4 of us (just ONE bottle of wine in that), I'd not darken the door again. There are so many great Italian places in SG....give this one a miss
5
Very friendly up scale family restaurant the owners come out and spend considerable time with the guests. Food is excellent I had the lamb shank it was to die for. Spouse ,son and daughter in law had the beef cheek which again was cooked to perfection. The grand kids had the fresh pasta made on the premises. We had a great appetizer I cannot recall the name it had buffalo cheese.Great evening good prices...worth a visit when in Singapor
1
Had always found the service at No Menu wanting, the wait staff snobbish and curt. Still, went for lunch on NYE and was surprised to find the place practically empty. No surprises why - prices were high, food was mediocre, service was lackluster. Seriously, there are lots of better Italian joints around the area offering better and more sincere food. Simply No Point. Do not, under any circumstances, order off the menu! They will charge you an arm and leg for it.
4
Tried the no menu bar for lunch - the prices are very very affordable. Had the baramundi fish and it was awesome. Owned and run by the Amarone chain, their pastas will never go wrong. Dinner is a little more pricey so be sure to check them out during lunch time
5
This restaurant had tons of vegetarian food options and the quality of food was superb! Serving staff is extremely proactive in suggesting the chef's recommendation and the service time is quick. I would like to visit the restaurant again!
3
Went there with my colleague for lunch. I ordered the lunch special main which is lobster pasta. It was quite tasty although it was quite expensive.
However the service was really average if not poor.
4
First time at this restaurant and taken by local friends. It has TWO venues within 100 meters, a small casual out side venue and a more formal indoor option. We ate in the smaller out door option and had a good but not exceptional meal at a very good price for both food and wine.For a simple, light and casual meal with a limited but good menu, this is a good spot
4
The benefits of working around the Telok Ayer area means plenty of opportunities to patronise the abundant choices of restaurants and finally had the chance to visit the much talked-about No Menu.Had the burrata for the starter and risotto as the main course. The lunch was signed off by the all time favourite panna cotta. Enjoyed the food to the fullest but the service was quite appalling. The service crews were always in a rush and did not offer much smile.With the kind of price that was paid for the quality food, the accompanying service left nothing much to be desired
5
Went there on a week night so no need to book. We had the burrata to start with. It is so tasty, though quite rich so don't order too much after. The main dishes: osso bucco and seafood stew, were really good and rustic. Only thing to improve: one of the daughters who takes care of the floor really has to improve in terms of being pleasant and cheerful!
5
When the owner/chef tells you that you'll eat what he eats it's generally a good start in an Italian restaurant. In this case our meal was simply excellent. Very good food, a good wine selection and attentive service by the two Forlino daughters and their mother, assisted by local staff that have to work in fifth gear to keep up with the familia
5
No Menu is an absolute must if you find yourself in Singapore. This family run restaurant provides more than an excellent meal. They provide a culinary experience from the minute you walk through the door. They make you feel as if your coming to their home for dinner. The entire staff is second to none and the cuisine is true to the source. You will thank me for writing this review. I guarantee it! Enjoy..........
4
Went there twice recently. Burrata was excellent and the best I've had anywhere! Steak and white truffle pasta were also spectacular, and their selection of Italian beers and wines impressive as well. Saw that others found there service to be average if not poor -- this surprises me. On the two occasions I was there, the Italian and Spanish ladies who served us were very attentive -- which was probably why we ordered and ate (and paid for) as much as we did
5
No Menu is a family run Italian restaurant situated in a shop house in the Tanjong Pagar area. The food and service is outstanding. The wine is excellent. It is busy so book a table as a walk in may risk a wait. It is worth a visit. 
2
We had a small smarter to share between myself and my girlfriend ie truffle pasta (so a small bowl each) the lady serving us did not listen to our ‘only the smallest bit of truffle’ on top – but proceeded to pile mountains of the expensive truffle on top despite telling her that it was enough. The waitress managed to force over sgd$150 onto a split starter which turned a reasonably priced meal into an expensive evening. We are regulars at this restaurant and the food was great as per usual, but be careful of the truffles!
5
Intimate dining that is family owned and operated. Chef came by to chat and tell us about his restaurant. Burrata app was fabulous. I had the black ink squid risotto. Very tasty. Tried the lasagne. Excellent. Tagliatelle lobster was tasty too. Chef dessert was a meringue that was to die for. Expensive but so is all the fine dining in Singapore. Highly recommend.
4
Decent restaurant. We had the Burrata Cheese as an appetizer and pasta for the main. Was good, so can't complain. Ambience was really cosy and toned down, this was especially nice since outside on Boon Tat Street it was crowded, hot and busy. Wait staff need more training, e.g. one waiter was shoving the menu in my face while I was trying to put something in my pocket; common sense would have told him to wait until my hands were free
4
If you want sowmthing fast, affordable and delish, go to no menu! We tend to go there in group of 4 and nothing more, as it is small table seating by the 5 foot way. Pasta are my fave, the prawn dish is so good till they removed it and upgrade it to another version by doubling the price. It did stopped us from going too often, but the grilled vegetables rock! Still go back there though
4
This is the best burrata I've ever had! The cheese melts in your mouth, the tomatoes are imported from Italy and are red ripe and taste so good! After this you don't need anything else but we still ordered the meat balls, a few salads, the spag bolognese and the steak, all great meals tasty and large. The wines are very expensive so go with the promotion if there is any. Ask for a nice bucket to keep it cold. The beers were fine. The service is slow and it took a bit of time to order....we sat outside and had a fan blowing right above us. This place is an expensive restaurant so have money to come here on a special occasion. Nothing stood out about this place except for the delicious burrata which we would come back for alone! You must book ahead! It fills up quickly even mid week
5
Since we live in S'pore we come to Chef Osvaldo Forlino's restaurants on special days of celebration. It is always sooo good. Very predictable... Excellent food, delicious wines, well trained staff, and owners passionate about their food. You pay for the quality, and definitely worth every dollar
5
Family restaurant , excellent italien food, best burrata outside Italy so far, very good seafood pasta, excellent osso bucco even if risotto was a bit sticky, all good even if prices are high and unpredictable due to "no menu". Next to it Ã  mire simple place with table outside proposes pasta for 12 to 18 sgd , simple and frankly as good as the business restaurant
3
very expensive two course lunch for two with just two glasses of wine; food was well cooked with fresh and tasty ingredients; service was over the top with an almost obtrusive "recommendation special of the day exclusive lunch time bla bla bla"; wine is outrageously expensivewould I go again: mayb
5
I've been traveling around the world since 1998 and Forlino is one of the best Italian cook living abroad. The 100% Italian top quality products mixed with the family management of the business make this restaurant my favourite in Singapore. And I'm Italian, been eating to Cracco,Marchesi, Barbieri and Cannavacciuolo.
5
This restaurant is run by an Italian family and the food is truly authentic Italian.The owners fly in most of the produce from Sicily twice a week so you are eating fresh produce and tomatoes that taste like tomatoes. The anti-pasta is a good starter and then go with whatever they recommend which is to your taste as it is all good. Bookings for dinner essential but lunch can be less busy. If you want a change from the excellent Singaporean food then this is it
2
Had very high hopes for this visit. Salivating when reading reviews and listening to friends recommendations. Special of the day was "Stewed Rabbit". Asked twice whether they were sure it was stewed, and got confirmed. Received a braised rabbit leg, that was very dry. Incredibly disappointing. Service took notes to kitchen, but never responded...Shame. Bill arrived after 10 minutes..
5
I love everything about this place - the food, the wine, the service, and the way we are welcomed back each time like old friends. I've been coming here every week for the past 4 months and have loved it every time!
5
one of my all time fave italian restaurant in singapore. food are never disappointed in here. must try is their buratta cheese which is freshly flown from italy everyday, their pasta are great too ! and don't forget to get the dessert !
4
Ordered service staff recommendation - lobster pasta, steak (out of the menu) and panna cotti which all turned out much better quality and taste then expected. The steak was cooked to the right texture and lobster was 1/2 a portion with a de-shelled pincer. Thumbs up for the food quality.Service was good as well. On top of our order, we were given free bread before the meal and additional desert after ours :)Even when the price is on the high side, it's a worth and must try
5
It is a small family run restaurant in Boon tat street that serves great and wuthentic italian food. We had a mixed set of people in the team - Indian, Italian, British-Belgian, Chinese, Singaporean and Malay...The food was excellent - freshly made. Every thing was right, the smell, the taste, the texture. The ambience was great. the owner was very humble and modest...One should definitely try this one while in SingaporeThe lamb shank was just too good and so was the entree and the deserts...
5
Small family restaurant down Boon Tat Street. Excellent food. Even the pasta was freshly made. Had a beef cheek which was to die for and amazing macaroons and tiramasu. I was even given an extra portion of macaroons. They have a standard menue the options were fish and beef the day we visited. If you are very selective better check before. Probably also need to reserve. well worth a visi
4
This place caught me by surprise. Once I arrived I was greeted by the chef and his wife. The ambiance is like visiting someone's home so don't expect anything elegant. But the food was excellent. Yes it was somewhat expensive but you get what you pay for. Excellent quality with natural ingredients
4
We visited No Menu with another couple, who highly recommended that we eat here. Being Italian myself, I don't enjoy eating at italian restaurants, as it's never as good as my moms cooking. I had my reservations about this place, but I was pleasantly surprised. We shared an appetizer plate that we shared, but I could easily have eaten it all myself. I had ravioli, which was out of this world, I offered a bite to my hubby but secretly hoped he would decline. The staff was lovely, taking the time to talk with us, and in fact, when we asked about the ingredients, we were told that they cannot get most of the ingredients here in Singapore and have to fly to Italy very often to bring them back. I completely agree that this is the best Italian restaurant in Singapore, and worth every penny
4
Went initially for a business dinner and haven't stopped going back. There are three venues to choose from and the menu is excellent. The burratta salad to start is as fresh as anything and very rare to find in singapore. Good wine list, attentive and chatty staff. The tortellini in brodo is also very good as is the osso bucco - will continue to go back often.
4
My daughter and I ate at No Menu on a Monday night. Enjoyed our food and wine but pretty shocked at the cost of the specials which we ordered, but probably in line with Singapore prices. Friendly family run restaurant - we appreciated the owner coming out and having a chat with us shortly after we arrived and the waitress was very friendly. It was my daughter's birthday and they even surprised her with a complimentary dessert with a candle in it and sang happy birthday to her. There is reasonably inexpensive wine on their wine list and which is good Italian wine. Would recommend, especially for a celebration
3
This is an Italian restaurant family run. Good quality of food, but price terribly disproportionate with what you're eating. "No menu" name comes from the fact this is a 'surprise' menu where you can just chose 'meat or fish'. Good ambience in a traditional Italian restaurant, but as said, price goes to the roof for very simple food, therefore my average rating
4
Family run, always attentive, can be busy, am a regular there, at least once a month! Very good wine list.
3
We order 2 botl of 07 italian
..came out to 700 sgd!!!! Food very ordinary ..overall not worth a second visit.
1
Gosh this restaurant is really over priced, for 4 persons for lunch came up to $716 inclusive a small bottle of wine, the waitress should explain the prices, won't come back or recommend.
4
The Mozzarella is high quality and the ravioli is high quality. I had the Scampi and while the linguine was superb, the seafood was bland.
Excellent wine selection and Vi was a real treat as a server.
I will happily return.
4
Great date for a date night or a business lunch! Good food and fantastic service. Book early to avoid disappointment.
4
We came here last night for dinner with our grown up children and it was terrific authentic Italian food! We dined at the bar outdoor, lovely atmosphere. The burrata is fantastic! The mozzarella cheese creamy, the tomatoes so tasty and flavoursome, the ravioli were delicious and light, the spaghetti bolognese very good, and the tapas some were good some bad. The meatballs had no flavour and watery, don't order these, the prosciutto with peach very tasty and the Italian homemade sausage a bit spicy. The focaccia was made in the premises but it was not that good! We didn't have dessert. The dinner is expensive. Go for the burrata! You can't go wrong. The waitress was the daughter of the owner, an efficient Italian girl who topped up our wines and didn't make any mistakes. We would come back here
3
I visited No Menu on a Friday night with my wife and her parents. After hearing some good reviews by colleagues I thought this should be a nice way to end the in-laws trip.The service was a little odd, the waitress seemed pre-occupied and a bit short when my wife wanted to ask her about the menu. The food itself wasn't very good, the pasta dishes a little plain. Price-wise it is not worth it, an expensive S$400+ bill for minimal, un-impressive food. The starts, anti-pasti for 4 people came on 4 dishes with a little mozarella, veggie and couple of pieces of ham came to S$150++ .. a bit shocking for a small starter!The atmosphere is cozy, with homely decorations and a well presented room, nevertheless I will not be returning there again

My fiancé and I visited No Menu as a little Valentines treat (after 4 years together it was the first we had actually been in the same country for the celebration). Not a huge fan of the convey belt style of dining most people experience on the St Valentine's, we decided to go out on Saturday 15th instead. As this was a huge treat, we were happy to pay a little extra for our meal. We had had No Menu recommended by friends who had given us the advanced warning of the pricing. What they hadn't warned us about was the bad service and the fact there is a Menu! On being sat at our table we were given a wine list, obviously we didn't expect a menu, this was fine. I have a working knowledge of wines, but, with a hefty price on every bottle on offer, I wanted to query the suitability of a given wine to see if it was a good all rounder. As we didn't know what we were going to have to eat, we didn't know what wine was suitable. After 10 minutes of trying to get our waiter's attention, I asked him about the wine. He didn't know. This was a surprise to me. Personally having an extensive background in services, I know that even the shabbiest bar or pub tend to give staff some knowledge on their wines. With a price range (from memory) of S$65-S$1000++ I would expect the staff to know what they are serving and guide the customer as necessary. He did say that he will go and find out. Another 10 minutes (20 minutes and we are yet to have even ordered a drink) and what appeared to be a more senior member of staff came to take our order. I repeated my query and she was able to assist. Great. Wine ordered now onto the greatly anticipated food. The same senior waitress, as she took our wine order, then introduced us to our food options or lack there of. We reiterated several times that this was our first time to the restaurant and didn't really know what to expect or how we go about the ordering process. We were then told that there was a tasting menu or meat or fish at S$108++, more than we were planning on spending, but she stopped talking so what was the alternative? She didn't even tell us what we were going to receive. Maybe we should have been more forward but I was a little bamboozled by the whole experience so far. As a result we were lead to believe this was our only option, duly ordered and waited for our wine.Our first course was put down, completely unintroduced. I would love to tell you what we had, but I don't know, I was never told. We were still waiting for our wine. I don't think I have ever had my first course without a drink. Halfway through trying to remove the digestive tract of a prawn in my second course, wine arrived. The food was nice (by no means phenomenal even excellent) but a sour taste had started to spread in our mouth as we noticed we were the only diners having a tasting menu. Other people were being seated and told about the amazing fresh fish, meat and pasta that was available. Others were shown the elusive menu. Halfway through our meal, seeing more and more people having these options presented, my partner asked the waitress why we had been given no introduction to the food or told what our options were when everyone else had. After a curt apology she said she had assumed… I don't like people to assume what I would like to eat after a 2 minute discussion regarding not having frequented the restaurant before. We felt a bit conned and uneducated. I don't think I have felt stupid in a restaurant before. Kindly, she did offer to now tell us what we could have had and not charge us for the tasting menu but as we were 3 courses in we were already quite full. The tasting menu was ok. It was very simple, a little under seasoned, two of the 5 course included mash potato, some variety would have been nice. I have had much better, much more reasonable Italians in Singapore. My impression may have been negatively influence by the service, but the food doesn't stick in my mind. You don't have to pay a fortune for great food in Singapore, even if everything is imported. I was really disappointed, just know your options if you go, it might be good for you

I have to agree with the below 200 ranking which this restaurant had at the time of our group booking on a weekday evening. The restaurant was packed and we were greeted by ?female boss whom we never ever saw again the rest of the 3 hours. Our group opted for the "surprise" option, which would consist of 6 courses. We waited for the starters with wine which we had brought (free corkage for first 2 bottles of BYO *thumbs up*) and warm bread and that gave AMPLE time to observe the goings-on in the eatery. The kitchen was staffed by Chinese and Indian cooks; pretty obvious from where we were seated. The decorations were plates (not Italian definitely), bottles of apricots?, and of course, dim lights.The starter was finished in 10 minutes and we waited for an excruciating 50 minutes for the next dish which comprised 2 prawns and 1 single mussel in ?tomato sauce? Very disappointing. Average tasting, for people who were famished by then. We had been served 3 plates of bread already.Need I say, when the other dishes followed rather quickly subsequently, we were too hungry to appreciate the really average food. There was some meat on mashed potato, and I opted for non-beef so had 3 small pieces of chicken instead. Spinach ravioli was good but didn't go too well with the penne in tomato sauce. Dessert was apple crumble and ice cream, nothing to scream about. Plates from the Fort Canning Country Club were used for the main course. Good service at the billing finale when we asked for 6 separate bills with our own credit cards, and they obliged. $99 ++There ARE better dining options around Telok Ayer for the amount we spent in those 3 hours

Was walking around the telok Ayer area and found this place. The atmosphere is very cozy. Food is okay. Price is about Singapore market price although I have read about the place being pricy. What I really like about the experience was from the experience of the female Italian manager who served us. It was really like a homely experience. I would come back in a big grou

We had booked a quiet table for 9 for a quiet business dinner .We sat next to the kitchen . We ordered a mix of starters thinking we would then choose the other courses . We were served the most expensive appetizers (effectively two servings per person) .By now we had already had sufficient ! Unannounced a pasta dish was served .Much of this was left .Then appeared industrial quantities of the most expensive "specials" on the menu .We were expecting fish . I think about two thirds of the food was left and loaded into doggy-bags . There was no way we could think of a dessert.Overall a ridiculous meal for which we paid an obscene sum 
4
I'm not used to paying so much for Italian food, but when you're in a country that has to import most of its produce and you're able to get some fresh tomatoes, I would say it's worth it. We ended up going on a night in December that every office in the city had decided was the appropriate night for a holiday party. We ate on the street outside No Menu Bar instead of in the restaurant proper and things were CRAZY. I think it was probably more customers than they could have anticipated and the service at first was a bit shaky. That being said, the one waitress who was trying to juggle all the diners outside kept her composure well and she as well as the chef and the family who owns the restaurant were all extremely accommodating. They let us order off the main restaurant's menu and we had a great meal. The burrata is a MUST HAVE here. We were 4 and ordered the whole. We were easily able to finish, but if you're not huge cheese eaters, the 1/2 is probably ok for that number of people. Dinner was great. I think the risotto dishes were the best at the table. The gnocchi itself was good as well, but the sauce was a bit plain. Overall, a very nice meal in Singapore. Would certainly recommend it to any travelers, but plan to spend some money
5
I recently dined at No menu bar, the newly opened casual dining space of No Menu restaurant. Having just been diagnosed as coeliac! I am finding the going tough when it comes to eating out in Singapore, however the warm hospitality shown at No Menu bar is like a shining light in the wilderness. They couldn't have been more accommodating offering a special dish with gluten free penne, and various little nibbles specially prepared for me pre dinner. Will definitely be going back again. Remember to ask for the chef to explain your food tolerances

Our friends who live in Singapore were very excited to take us to this Italian Trattoria and we had high expectations. We had to wait for a table, but they were very kind to put us at a table in their outdoor cafe while we waited with a complimentary glass of wine each. So far so good. When we finally got seated (a good half hour after what was promised), we still had high expectations. Unfortunately they were quickly dashed. We tried ordering the burrata starter recommended by one of the daughters who was our waitress. We thought we would share a a few, but when they came, one portion was significantly smaller than the other two. When we pointed this out, it was quickly brushed aside (as if there they didn't understand English). There goes one star in the rating, as they did nothing to rectify the situation. Then we had a second course that the daughter/waiter suggested - the white truffle pasta - one of our favorites, so we all tried it, even though she told us the price upfront would be $20 per gram since white truffle is so rare. We understood and took the bait. When the dish came, the small portion (which we thought was going to be a dinner portion not an appetizer portion) was swimming in a watery butter sauce. There goes star number 2.We shared a pork chop which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. So we were back on track... or so we thought... until the bill came. In all she shaved 18 grams of truffle onto our sparse pasta plates. So there was $360 for this course which wasn't particularly spectacular. They should all go to Ciccone's in London for this dish - not only is it better, heartier and cheaper (in London no less!) but it also better prepared with a lovely coating to the noodles that works perfectly with the truffle. When the bill came (it turned out to be over $800 with wine for a meal that left several people still hungry), they had the audacity to charge an additional $20 per plate for the watery pasta on top of the surcharge for the truffle. Talk about insult to injury!So there goes the third star for my rating.The overall experience was as if we had been fleeced. Unfortunately we were guests and did not want to embarrass our hosts. But it was only after quizzing them later that we found out about the padding of the bill another $80 for pasta that made me compelled to write this negative review. I cannot remember feeling so ripped off in a restaurant in a long time. Like some other reviewers - we found that the waitress pushed some appetizers and secondi to simply pad the bill. Some of the dishes were delicious, but unfortunately we cannot recommend them due to their business practices. I hope it was just a fluke, but from some of the other reviews I think this "upselling" is part of their modus operandi. Diner beware

Top class simple Italian fare, no fussiness. Excellent service well marshalled by dedicated owners on site. Location is terrific also on Telok Ayer. Good spot for a few Sols of a Friday too. Will definitely be back. This place is authentic and relaxed. Fresh simple Italian classics. Winner.

We visited mid week and early evening so the restaurant was empty when we arrived, however it soon started to fill-up. The restaurant is split in two halves with the waiting staff having to go outside to move from one side to the other which is a bit strange, especially when you pay the bill and the waiter disappears outside with your credit card. The food was good I had a pasta and my husband the crispy duck. The portion size is just right leaving room for dessert. We decided on the cheese board which was a selection of 5 cheeses with lovely chutney's and rustic bread - plenty for 2 to share. The no menu option was available and as I understand a complete surprise including the number of courses - perhaps next time!

As much as I was disappointed by Pietrasanta, I was pleasantly surprised by No Menu. As one of my predecessor wrote there is in fact a traditional menu but you can let the chef, a lady, make it up for you. Indeed they tend to select the finest dishes and the bill can climb. But ingredients are tasty, the pasta and risotti cooking al dente, presentation is what you really expected and the atmosphere too. Service? Is what you can expect in a family owned and run trattoria. Italian and efficient: I confirm a real family italian trattoria of quality. So is the bill for our italian standards, but well we are in hypee Singapore and it is kind of worth it...You can go at No Menu and enjoy an italian experience

The name of the restaurant (No Menu) says it all. Although they do have a menu, the best choice is the "no menu" option where the chef prepares a meal of multiple courses, all designed to complement all of the other dishes that are served. Service is excellent. Will definitely look forward to the next opportunity to visit

1st of all, I must say service is top notch but I am not surprised by the Italian hospitality.Food wise, we chose the no menu which is the speciality of the day. Love the appertisers and FINALLY, a real decent Buratta! I've always been disappointed with restaurants selling Buffala morzarella & passing that off at Buratta. I am extremely happy & satisifed with the cold cuts too.However, I can't say much for the 1st and 2nd course:My hubby had their hand-made pasta with truffles: It was a lacklurst effort for the pasta wasn't drained off water properly. He had washed down pasta with truffle that wasn't outstanding too. I had the Milanese which was very generous & meat was pretty reasonable, not too tough. However, the coating was too thick that didn't quite make the cut.I chose the apple cake which is supposed to be the grandmother's receipe & hubby had the tiramisu. We were disappointed.Perhaps next visit, we will take it off the real menu instead

Service started off very nicely as the owner's wife was even waiting outside the restaurant to greet you. This place is known for its no menu approach - ie degustation menu and you let the chef cook for you ( I guess italian omakase ).We opted for the a la carte and was recommended to start with burrata cheese, tomato, prosciutto Parma ham, peach and if we don't want ham we could have beef. After quite lengthy discussions with the waitress, we said we wanted the burrata only to SHARE but she said she can put the others (ie ham etc) in a small plate.Out came three big plates which were not what we expected as we wanted one starter to share. We returned the plate with parma ham and peach which looked good but again not what we ordered. We had the 2 plates which was with burrata and prosciutto - generous portion if it were considered as one starter for sharing.We looked around and pretty much every one in the restaurant got the same recommended dishes to start - each got a burrata dish and the table shared some Parma and peach.The wild boar pappardelle was perfectly cooked (al dente) and we had the porcini tagliatelle which was lovely too. No surprise - when the bill came we got charged three starters, each was sgd35 + ! And it was clear why everyone in the restaurant got such recommendation. We disputed the third starter which we returned and the restaurant immediately amended the bill. When our waitress came we explained again we actually only wanted one starter to share but now got charged two starters for a total of 70 sgd, again she gladly took the other starter off the bill which was nice of her although we would rather not be in that situation.Although we were not over charged in the end and the food was excellent, the fact that we got pushed to have more starters and nearly got charged for them left us with a bitter taste and we did not want to stay longer. We could have ordered more wine and dessert and coffee but chose to go somewhere else purely because of this. Our waitress was fine but I would not call that top service. She finished pouring our wine without looking at us and asking if we wanted more wine or not.Tourists may not care or notice being charged a lot for starters but we do and it was interesting to note that when we disputed about having ordered one starter it was immediately acknowledged that that was a misunderstanding. If you like the food at this restaurant you can try burlamacco nearby - same quality but no miscommunication and bitter taste

We have dinner at the private room on the second floor.. They chefs came to see us and also provided an array of food for the night.. Excellent services too
5
No menu continues to please. 5th visit in 12 mths. The wine list is nice with some excellent Italian reds, of course. The service continues to be exceptional. They have it right. Attention to detail is magnificent. Small things can mean such a lot. The food was good yet again. Prawns from a home made recipe from a competitor in Italy....the passion with which the food and service is delivered is stunning....
5
I went there with friends and we were pleasantly surprised by the dÃ©cor of the restaurant: it feels like you are at your grand-ma's place about to eat the best traditional Italian food ever...and it was! The burrata (creamy mozzarella) was out of this world, all of our dishes were simple, flavorful and authentic. A nice thick Italian accents from the waitresses (daughters of the owner) added up to the charm of the night:) Highly recommended for Italian food lovers
5
With memories of the delicious bread, burrata cheese, sweet Sicilian tomatoes and wonderful desserts from my first visit, I returned with two other friends and No Menu delivers again. Service was warm, friendly and genuine and our only 'complaint' is we left way too full! The three of us shared our main course of homemade pasta with porcini mushrooms and wild boar, both yummy, only because we had gone overboard with the appetisers. We could have done away with the octopus appetiser as it was somewhat "fishy" and we were completely satisfied with the cheese, tomatoes and ham - in taste and portion. Looking forward to our next visit

Have been several times with guests and always enjoyed the food and service. Excellent range of wine and specials. Owner always makes a effort to welcome you and help in meal selection. Simple quality ingredients well cooked. Well worth a visit (Wild Boar pasta a personal fav
4
Been twice so far. First time was good, but not outstanding, and the portion of wild ragout homemade pasta was a bit small (I'm a big eater and what feels like 80ish grams portions for $25 or whatever i find rather unimpressive). The second time however, I found the saffron risotto one of the best I've had in Singapore (still, not as big a portion as Latteria, which is abnormally abundant, but better than the 2 teaspons some other places serve as 'main' ). Perfect texture / flavor and competent staff

We found this restaurant by sure chance as we explored the back streets of the CBD on a weekend. Osvaldo and his wife are both chefs in their family restaurant and they provided a very warm and personal welcome to their restaurant. It felt more like having dinner in their very own kitchen. It is really a family run establishment, with their daughters helping out with table service. Needless to say, the italian accent is thick but one really does feel like being in italy.We started off with the house special, mussels in white wine and they get it fresh from new zealand, caught from the sea not farmed mussels. Its not on the menu but worth asking for it. The sauce is simple, clean and a nice after taste,not over powering laden with heavy spices. In fact that best describes osvaldo's style of cooking, simple, fresh and uncomplicated.We paired it with osvaldo's branded house white wine which he specially imports from northern italy. i loved it, and pairs beautifully with seafood, its light fruity, no acidic after taste and mild sweetness that lingers on the tongue.Next was the main course, again we took the house specials for night, i had the lobster pasta and my partner had the ribeye beef. Again another well cooked dish. Osvaldo let in that he only gets 10 lobsters each time to ensure freshness and once its all gone thats it for the night. Sauce was home made tomato puree, with generous portions of chopped italian tomato and again no spicy or lingering after taste. The beef was nicely seared with succulent pink centre for well done portion and simply melts with each bite.Ive been around several italian places in singapore and being local its hard to find one that really matches the fabulous cooking one gets from authentic italian places just like its done in italy. It isnt really cheap but i will say it compares fairly to prices you would pay if you were to dine at an italian restaurant in a hotel, but you will get far superior cooking at osvaldo's.What really impressed me is the personal service the entire family gives to each customer and for anyone who dines there, it was a priviledge to have osvaldo step out of the kitchen occasionally to say hello to all his clients and even serve them his personal style of bruschetta which is easily topped up. I felt like a school kid wiping my plate with bruschetta to savour both the lobster pasta sauce and mussel white wine sauces. I am also impressed by the gregarious nature of the entire family to chat even though it was busy on a weekend night. I will be back and try their degustation menu next, but bring a big appetite. Portions are nice size and filling. And before i forget, the tiramisu is served in nice cups with generous toppings of coca that makes it an excellent finish to a splendid meal.I am not sure if osvaldo or his family get to read these reviews but if they do, may i say gazie tante for a lovely meal and time

Currently the restaurants of Osvaldo are the most authentic Italian restaurants in Singapore. The atmosphere is great, the restaurant busy and the dishes classic, somehow customized and the service is phantasmic. It is a family business after all.We had the Vitello Tonnato and a lot of Anti Pasti. Several types of meat, cheeses and tomatos with tast, which are sometimes difficult to get in a Singaporean restaurant, where served. As it is located close to CBD, it is busy - Make a reservation
4
Small place next to another main restaurant. Italian food and the owner has a family member taking care of each establishment.Ingredients are flown in from Italy from chosen sources, explained when served so you are transported to Sicily or Tuscany while the food is served.Delicious and well presented

it's been some time since I visited No Menu at night, as I wouldn't normally go back to the Business District after work. However I was entertaining old friends from out of town and I wanted a cosy, friendly place which was not noisy and where we could chat. It hit the right spot tonight. Although the restaurant was full, we had excellent service and the noise level was comfortable enough for us to chat until we were the second last table to leave. I read some of the other reviews which experienced poor service but we did not have any problems. One of our party needed to leave within one and a half hours of the orders being taken and although all four of us had the degustation menu, the entire meal was served within that time with no sense of rush. The menu itself was substantial, five large courses, all of them of a high quality. It was not three star standard but it had a home cooked feel about it and suited the occasion perfectly. The staff were not obtrusive but were there when needed. Various members of the Forlino family dropped by to explain the dishes. The price was not cheap but was about par for this quality. Definitely worth a repeat visit

Had an office lunch here. Great service and very plush and cosy private dining rooms on the second floor. Food was delicious but pricey. Compact but excellent wine list.
4
Great food and service from a family ran restaurant. I like the rustic style and cozy environment. However a little bit pricey.
4
I've been tried many Italian restaurants around the world and finally I found a good one.A bit classy with good food made me spend a pleasant evening. The restaurant inside is not so huge, but tastefully simple and elegant, a good service punctuated by a romantic and relaxing atmosphere, in short, all the ingredients for a good dinner. Sooner or later we will come back

great italian food in singapore. run by a north italian family. they take a lot of pain to give an authentic feel of italy. worth it. enjoy the ride. if you have travelled to italy as a tourist...you will enjoy the accents. nice ambience though it is on an unimposing street. go for it...also the wines are decent even the house pour chianti....do not buy the post dinner shots...you get ripped on those...rest is great valu

I'd been here a couple of years ago and really enjoyed lunch then, so I was looking forward to coming again for authentic Italian food and service. Whilst the food was pretty good, delicious Burrata and pasta dishes, the service was somewhat sub-standard, with long waits for ordering, asking for the bill and finally getting the bill. We had to ask for a drink, and the only thing that arrived promptly were the bottles of pellegrino, our glasses were always kept full - we were never even asked if we wanted another bottle after the first. The inviting looking armchairs are really uncomfortable and should be changed, well the 3 we tried had springs that were gone. No sure I will be rushing back
3
Cosy place, good service and lovely ambience but the food did not quite deliver the punch we'd expected after getting so many upbeat feedbacks on the place. Burrata was thick but slightly flat, ham was excellent, veal was not great. Beef cheek was good, but lamb shank was so so. Pasta main courses were alright but out of 10 friends who had dinner there, only 2 were impressed. For the taste, it is a little overpriced
4
I had lunch with a client here during the week. Located in a charming shop house in a central location in the city, it was a convenient choice for a business lunchA very nice interior, some interesting furniture and carpets gave a good first impression. The ambience is lively and energetic which was a good match for the friendly service.The menu has a good selection of Italian classics and an equally good selection of daily specials. The food arrived in a timely fashion and was well cooked and presented, finished off with a nice cup of coffee.I'm pleased to have been there and look forward to visiting again

It's didn't start well. I was trying to park whilst my wife ( and guests) tried to get seated. No Menu have three restaurants all next door to each other and we had to stand outside whilst the desk decided which one we were booked into... By the time I got there say 5 mins later, we're all seated, but no menu, no water- not great service. As at most Italians in our experience you have to watch the ordering- they always seem to forget English or misunderstand....try and sell up- this was no exception.The no menu bit really means a digest action menu 10 course - but we had to ask for the price( funny that)! Then the specials were explained- again we had to ask what was the pricing.... And then we look at the menu ( which of course they have ). Interestingly for a family restaurant only one pasta dish was ' homemade pasta' which means the other 5-6 pasta dishes weren't... Almost $180 for the steak seem a bit excessive fish was market price!? Rabbit $60 etc, so we decided to do what we usually do- order appetizers to share, a pasta dishes to share and then rest whilst we decide on main course. Guess what... The waitress double ordered the burrata ( I told you about Italian restaurants) ... As it happens for a Italian family restaurant grand pa osvaldo is the chef etc etc, the kitchen is kind of open - not a single Caucasian face in there it could have been his day off, but nevertheless they food was good. The burrata was to old- tougher on outside ( that's probably why it was mistakenly double ordered and broken open already when it was served) , but the home made pasta was indeed good. Whilst all this was going on we had a bottle of prosecoc and by the time the pasta came I ordered a bottle of red wine. Yes you guessed it the waiter ( Indian) recommended one 50% more expensive... But I knew this wine and it was less body and fruitier so we stuck to my choice. Unfortunately the service seemed less attentive after that. And whilst I was looking at another bottle of wine ( don't panic we had a driver back) the server whisked away the glasses and we were brought a small cheese plate... I expained that we needed a moment whilst we choose the main course ( and i was looking at the wine list again) but we got the feeling that we weren't appreciated. We even had the chef niece jumping and clapping at some regular customers returning next to us.... Which seems great for their relationship- but of course made everyone else seem less important....I can only take so many hugs and kisses and jumping and silent claps....So all in all we felt the structure of the menu was ill considered the digestation was around ( including ++) $130; appetizer , pastas, main was around $120 all in and specials were more expensive. the pricing wasn't clever....and the buy up subtlety wasnt very subtle. We did like the atmosphere, the tables well spaced, the seats very comfortable. The service staff was like the united nations, Indian, Malay, Chinese Singaporean, two Italian nieces front of house. etc etc it did seem very .... What's the word ....hectic. All in all, I'd say the food was good ( that's average for Singapore) and the service was superficial. We felt comfortable but always being nudged to buy up....Frankly we won't be going back for a while if at all

We had a very nice dinner with friends at No Menu. The menu is enough to make you hungry! We had a great meal, each of our dishes were wonderful. I had the burrata cheese with parma ham, asparagus risotto, and the family's homemade tiramisu was offered to us as a dessert because we couldn't make up our minds! The family that owns and runs the place it was very sweet. They all work their together (Mom, Dad, and daughters) and they make their way around the restaurant throughout the meal to check on everyone. The atmosphere was very friendly and welcoming, a cozy place in a big city. We'll be back
5
What a wonderful place to find off the beaten track. A chic dining room with deep comfortable arm chairs to sit back in and enjoy the experience. There is atmosphere and an intimacy about the place which is hard to manufacture, probably because this place is owned by an Italian family and so it is genuine. The food is to die for and the service excellent, attentive but not pressured. All homemade breads and pastas and desserts, we tried some newly pressed Olive oil from the family grove..the likes of which I have never tasted in my life!For a truly great dining experience in a part of the world far removed from the beautiful Italy you simply must try
3
The ambiance is very homy; the service is attentive although waiters only offer pepper, etc if asked; the food is good. However, in the same price range, there are many more Italian restaurants in Singapore with better, more creative food, and more assiduous service.

My girlfriend and I had an fantastic dinner at No Menu on Saturday night. Had the Osso bucco with saffron risotto accompanied by a great bottle of Brunello! Love the ambiance and great service. Highly recommended and we will be back!
5
We can here on the recommendation of a work colleague. There are menus available, but we went with the tasting menu and were definitely not disappointed. Everything was cooked to perfection and matched with good wine. The staff were more knowledgeable than anywhere else I have every been. It is a family run business and the passion of them shines through. An expensive night out, but superb for a treat. We'll be back

We had dinner with friends here a couple of weekends ago. The a la carte menu is extensive but if you're daring, go for the "no menu" where the chef cooks for you, based on your food preferences (we had someone allergic to shell fish and someone who couldn't eat pork). Two things about the no menu; is there is no price and all the table has to opt for it!Given that, the starter was a selection of the appetisers, followed by a selection of pasta and a risotto, then a meat / fish course, sorbet and desert. Good selection of tasters, without any one being over-whelming.What is lovely about the place is the service. Our waitress was family, and the Chef - her aunt. When we asked a question about what rice to use for a risotto, Patrica (the chef) came out personally to talk to us about the whys and wherefores.Easy to find - its tucked away in the CDB and is a hidden gem. We will certainly go back again. We just need another 'occasion'
4
Have eaten here many times and taken many guests. Nobody has ever been disappointed. During both lunch and dinner the service is superb. All staff are well trained, knowledgeable and clearly take great pride in their work. The. Restaurant would be a bit tricky to find if you don't know where you are going, being tucked away in a shophouse style building. Look for the "osvaldo" and "no menu" stickers on the window. Despite its name a menu is available offering pastas, meat, poultry and fish dishes or you can opt for the tasting menu. Just tell the waitress what you don't eat and leave the rest to the chef. From the menu, the pastas are always fresh and clearly home made - not out of a packet like too many restaurants these days. There are always specials on offer and if you are a meat eater try the T-bone steak to share - magnificent. The minestrone soup is also one of the best I have ever had but don't expect the norm. This is a thick meaty soup where the veg have all been blended. It is superb. Nice touches include various items including wines and peaches from Osvaldo's home town, complimentary amuse bouche and Parmesan cheese. Bread is also home made. The wine list is also extensive and reasonably priced for Singapore. The dining room is small and intimate which, coupled with the attitude and energy of the staff, makes for a lovely warm atmosphere but make sure you book to avoid disappointment. All in all I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys good food good wine and a convivial atmosphere

Young belgian couple:We both had a starters and main dishes. I tried a suggestion which was zuchini flower. Flowers were stuffed with some kind of cheese with a green salad. Later when the bill came, we saw that the suggestion cost 39$ ... Not worthy for a fried stuff. My boyfriend had a classic minestrone soupe which was okay, not superb but okay.The dishes came, it was good. The quantity was huge. My spinash and salame risitto was good.We had 4 glasses of red, a dessert, a double espresso and a bottle of sparkling of san peligrino. We paid 250$/2 pers.A bit of dissapointment because the food wasn't what we expected from this high end restaurant. Out of 10 my boyfriend and I both rated at 5.5/10. Service 8/10.We are not sure we would go back again.
5
We had the tasting menu which turned out to be great value for money. The service was very good and the ambience perfect. Love the selection of half bottles which suited us both, we took the champagne and red to go with the dinner. I am bringing my other friends back here soon, to try out the ala carte menu
3
In general the food was nice but Too Expensive to pay. We were of 4 having dinner and heard abt the place but not the $$$$$. Had a mixed cold cut starter to share, debone fish fillet nothing on the side, beef(maybe 500g) , 02 pasta and 02 bottles of wine about @$150 and 02 desserts to share. Bill was close to SGD$1000 !!!
4
Located in the business district, this place is definitely worth a try. Food is excellent, staff is extremely available and although it's not that simple to order -given that there's no menu!- you are very unlikely to be disappointed with what you'll see in your plate.Given this quality price is reasonable

A regular fave of my bro who lives in Singapore. He booked here to have our catch up dinner on a recent trip.Excellent service from the time we stepped in the door. No request was refused and recommendations made based on our likes / dislikes.We had Fresh buffala and serrano to start. I then had Vitello Tonnato as a main (originally an entree, but they cater to diners needs and made mine a main). The bufalla was like eating a cloud and the Vitello - mamma mia - my mouth just burst in delight. Chefs special dessert - Fresh raspberry and choc flan sent me over the edge into euphoria.My bro had the lobster and he loved every mouth full. My other bro had the wild boar ragout and devoured it.Compared to prices in Perth for the same, it was excellent value and we cannot wait for our next trip to return. Lovely Lovely place and recommend
