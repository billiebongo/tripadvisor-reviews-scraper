For fantastic and consistent Indian food such as prata with dalcha gravy, thosai and briyani topped off with a glass of teh tarik, get on a Grab or Uber and come to this place..you will not be dissapointed.

Everyday crowded. Tried the food, is so-so. Quite expensive though. A good place to hang-out and have a casual Teh-tarik.

Visited this restaurant thinking they sell chapati for breakfast, unfortunately not so ended up ordering their prata and dosai. Prata is not crispy with reasonable portion size. Dosai is good but the dip sauce is top spicy for me.

Great place for prata and teh Tarik. Cleaned up everything including the sauce. Also had mutton curry. Was lovely. Will come back and strongly recommend this place

Open 24 hours, this outlet is a great place to go for comfort food when you crave some in the middle of the night. Breakfast for us comprised prata kosong (plain prata) and egg prata. Would have preferred if it was slightly more crispy but have yet to find the perfect prata for ourselves.

Came to Singapore for one week to visit a friend who lives in the neighbourhood.First night he asked me if i like Prata.I told him yes and he brought me to this place saying you wonÂ´t find a better prata place in Singapore.And he was right.In fact it was so good that i came back here twice for having more prata.My favourite the fish curry and cheese prata.All freshly made on the spot

This is my go-to place for prata kosong (or plain roti prata). Their prata is freshly made on the spot, and is amazingly crispy. I recommend having it with their fish curry too!Besides prata kosong, you can also give their lamb murtabak a try. Be careful, though, because their portions are enormous, so do share this with a friend.Finally, both their chicken and lamb nasi briyani are pretty tasty as well.PRO-TIP 1: On Fridays, they serve a special briyani - it's usually lamb, but it comes with an appetizer and a dessert. PRO-TIP 2: Try not to go later than 8:30pm, because most of their food (other than prata) gets sold out by then, even though they're open 24 hours. So if you're looking for lamb curry to go with your prata, you'd be sorely disappointed
