Nice wu Xiang xia ping with reasonable price. Do take note , they don't sell bee hoon. So you may order some other food from Other stall.
My recommendation is the porridge stall beside.

Deep fried 'Wu Xiang' in the potong pasir/macpherson area. The stallowners have been at it for many years. Must try the prawn fritters and the sauce is the right balance of spicy and sweet. Any other item is a mystery to me but blindly picking stuff has never disappointed. Afterwards, you can head across the road for the famous river south hoe nam prawn mee

In a new location, this popular stall continues to serve one of the best prawn fritters and ngoh hiang - a local dish of an assortment of deep fried cakes made from fish paste, meat rolls with five spices that are eaten with a dip and paired with fried bee hoon. Unlike some of the better known stalls where you get a standard assortment, here you still get the fun of picking out what you like to have before handing your selection over for them to be prepared

I was driving around the Macpherson area one evening and saw a new development at the former Jackson Food Centre. This food centre had lots of good stalls which have moved away and some closed for good.I decided to drive into the lane next to the development and found a corner food court at Tai Thong Cresent. As I was driving past , I spotted this stall at the corner – Lao Zhong Zhong Fine Spice Stall. I had earlier skipped lunch and was feeling a little hungry. As I had about 20 minutes before my next appointment, I decided to order some for old times sake.The variety is good and I picked up five items, so as not to spoil my appetite for dinner in 2 hours time.I ordered the fishball, prawn cracker, carrot pastry, ‘Ngor Hiang’ (Pork roll) and ‘Tau Kwa’ (Bean curd). All were fried and served in less than 5 minutes. All were good. I especially love the tau kwa, which was very fresh. The carrot pastry was also good. Nice and crispy.Most importantly, the chilli dip was good. It had diced onions and grounded peanuts, which came a nice texture and crunch.I was worried the portions were too much, but it was just nice.Go early to avoid long queues.My order came up to $3.50. Comparing the pricing for such stalls in shopping centre food courts, I reckon, the pricing would come up to $5. So good value here.It was a good snack, and my whole meal from ordering to eating all my food was in less than 15 minutes, allowing good time to be on my way to my appointment nearby.Now that I know where they are located, I will be back here again.Recommended
