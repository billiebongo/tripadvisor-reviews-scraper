I stumbled upon this place and decided to have lunch there. The food was fantastic. It tasted fresh and really like home-cooked meal. Not the typical commercial food. I will be back for more.

lovely food, great ambiance and quick service that's how i would summarize my experience at lemon & herbs. <3

I had the fish and chips and salad. The fish was a bit bland, the chip undercooked, but the salad was quite nice. Service was quite good and fast

The staff is friendly and welcoming. Food is mostly western style. Atmosphere is casual, like a family run cafe. I went back a second time while staying in the hotel next door.

This is another one of the few lunch places at Changi Business Park. Food is nice but I feel that the serving is small for the prices charged. In contrast, I feel that I get much better value at the Rotisserie in the CBD. Given the lack of dining options at CBP, this is probably acceptable..

I'm really quite happy to see that Lemon & Herbs has survived in the ultra-competitive market that is Singapore's food scene - very few small businesses survive for long in this environment. Slightly updated menu with variations, small but pleasant cafe environment, friendly and efficient wait-staff, tap water on request (thumbs up!). Food still has the "home-cooked" feel; none the worse for that, and most dishes we tried ranged from not bad to pretty good. No, I am not damning with faint praise, it's just a reflection of the quality you get, for the price you pay. I also notice they serve breakfast, so may will come back for a fry-up one day

I stop by Lemon & Herb on loops to teach in Singapore, and always enjoy it. I usually order the Asian Tofu Salad, which is at the light end of their offerings, but really well done. I ventured a hamburger recently, and it was the best I've had in quite a while. The French and continental entres look great, and I'm hoping for an omelette next time. Really good espresso as well - much appreciated after a flight

Intend to try Yum Cha but reach there a bit earlier. See Lemon & Herbs and decide to try it out. Order one roasted chicken and one poached salmon. It well present and good taste. Will try it again on another Saturday but not on Monday to Friday

Tucked away in a corridor at UE BizHub East, this unassuming bistro-styled diner presents a simple menu. Decor is IKEA-style, chairs are plastic, cutlery and napkins are "help-yourself": but all pleasant enough. We were here for dinner, and it wasn't crowded. The menu was mainly the staples - their roast chicken is supposedly their dish to try, which I had. It was well-flavoured and moist. The others had fish and chips (it was probably dory, but reasonably priced and presented) and a pasta dish (nice flavour, perhaps a little salty). We also had a side-Caesar salad, and leaves were crisp and fresh. Prices are reasonable, service was friendly, and food arrived quickly. If you are in the area and looking for a fuss-free meal, this is it
