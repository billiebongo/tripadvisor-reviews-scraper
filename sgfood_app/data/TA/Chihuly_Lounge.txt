We stayed at The Ritz and spent some time at the lounge each day - a few times for a late meal and at other times just for a drink. Great personal and attentive service from Matthew and the other staff there.

Excellent services
With smiling faces all rounds
Warm welcomes from staffs and always attend to what we needs
Foods was awesome
Most of all i would likes to give credit to Ms Sandrine Qu very nice staff
Will come again..cheers

We went to Chihuly lounge on Friday afternoon.When we had arrived at the lounge, because of heavy rain, clothes of my wife was so wet.At that time, kindly staff, George, helped us. He brought us some towel and change of clothes. We were in great trouble, so his work was very helpful.After that, we enjoyed wonderful tea time with so cute and delicious sweets

We visited the lounge on a Wednesday night, looking for a beautiful place to relax after a day's of work. We had Salmon & crisps, Singapore Sling, latte, and they were delicious. Stay around until 9 pm, and you get to enjoy a live performance by a singer and pianist. It was music to the ears and made an excellent addition to our night there. The service staff on duty were extremely attentive as they made an effort to make sure you are comfortable. They are easily some of the best that I have experienced as of yet in Singapore. However, we do note that the table we sat at was directly under the air conditioner, which led to some drops of condensed water dripping onto us during the meal. After moving to a sofa seat, it was again right under the air conditioner, which was slightly too cold. Overall, it was a pleasant experience, and I would return for a second visit
4
Nice place and the services by the staff were good they always attend us with a nice smiling face and meet our needs. Foods was delicious and would come back again. Hereby I would like to gives credit to all the staffs with their well manners and their attentive to our needs
2
We were there for high tea.The table we were escorted was directly under the airconditioning duct on the cealing and when we started enjoying the tea, colored water started dropping on my pants . When we quietely drew the waiter's attention to my already stained pants, she just kept saying "sorry" without escorting another table. she did not even bring any towels. I have been staying Ritz in many other countries with full satisfaction, this is the only sad experience we would remember
3
We had the weird 8 course lunch thing - all but one was sweet, very sweet, too sweet and pretty average- looked pretty but tasted forgettable. My expectations were high so it was a bit of a disappointment. The thin sliver of wagu on may potato was good

CHIHULY Lounge at the Ritz-Carlton Millennia have always been a favourite hangout place for myself and a few close confidante.Was back at the lounge for the usual relaxation on a Friday night. The staff are always attentive and always there to anticipate your potential needs. Though everything is great, there is one thing that still mades the visit uncomfortable. The new layout of the lounge is uncomfortable for guest who wishes to enjoy and watch the pianist/performers at their life performance.With the sofa taken aback far away from the piano, I am unable to enjoy the.life.music up close and personal.A memorable experience at the lounge is a complete experience.The food, drinks, the services of the staff but also for guest to be able the music in great comfort.It saddens me that I am unable to fully enjoy the Chihuly Lounge experience under the new layout.I do hope the layout can be revised for guest to enjoy the Chihuly Lounge experience in a more comfortable experience
5
Awesome space, good atmosphere. If you want to avoid the heat and humidity outside, sit back and relax there.
5
Nice drinks, great ambience and music
Tia was friendly and attentive
Interesting presentation of gin cocktails by Tia and Jocelyn
Sherwin was quite knowledgeable about varieties of gin and tonic water
5
Comfortable, good natural lighting and music. Attentive staff who wear smiles all the time. Keep it up!
5
The ambience at chihuly lounge was so awesome and it was further improved by the service rendered by Jacob this evening was absolutely sublime. He shows great knowledge in the drinks served. He gave my friends and I a wonderful experience. Thank you Jacobüëçüèª.
5
Great place to have quiet tea with piano music. Outstanding and friendly service extended especially by Tia Yjiun Lee and Sherwin Chew. Thank you!
5
Food, service, and setting were absolutely fantastic! The Mango Sorbet was delicious. Isis and Tia were wonderful servers!
4
I arrived late in the evening and was pleased to spend a little time in the Chihuly Lounge before going to aur rooms. Energetic cocktails, wine, beers, coffee and tea and snacks. Staff are attentive and friendly.
5
Thanks to Martin for the great drinks. Geroge for the warm welcome. And Sherwin for the attentive service. Another evening at the lounge was a great pleasure.
5
 The music played by the live band was soothing to the ears, it made me felt comfortable in the lounge. I'm really impressed by the amazing ambience. The old fashioned cocktail made by Angela was really well balanced, love it. I'm also impressed by how Server Lucy executed her enthusiasm and portrayed her professionalism. She took care of my table really well. Thumbs up to her interaction skills, she is a perfect example how a 5-star Hotel Server should be Overall,great first experience and surely not the last
5
Spend time here during Negroni week - bar tender pulled out fantastic Negroni's and staff was truly attentive. The best place to chill out over a drink in Singapore bay area. Ritz bar design is impressive. Big thanks to Isis and rest of the bar crew Tia, Sandrine, Jacob, Regina, Martin, David and Jeffrey - keep up the great work
5
Had coffee and cocktails. Fine ambiance. Live piano music. Pianist sings very well. Service was excellent.
5
Staff are very friendly. Wagyu Burger was nice. I want to recommend their cocktail as well. The Best!
4
A place where you can go for high teas and catch up with your friends! Classy and comfortable lounge to spend time at
5
I was there at the lounge in the evening to reserve our usual table for the evening later that night. George, a staff of the lounge, who saw us from far came over and greeted us to attend to us. His proactive action and the forever bright smile and pleasant service in taking our reservations for the night was remarkable. Sherwin, one of the staff from the banquet side who was there to stand in to help the lounge took the initiative to do some homework. As regular patrons of the hotel, Sherwin took the initiative to query with the fellow team mates of the lounge ie Martin and George to know more and understand the requirements of the guests so that each visit is always a pleasant and memorable irregardless of whether the staff serving you is new or a regular staff. Minor things like this made a difference in the guest experiences. Having being served by the familiar faces of the lounge, this made the experience better and more memorable. Sherwin, George and Martin was attentive to our needs Making out stay pleasant and memorable as always. Addressing the guests by our name made the each visit more personal and this made each visit at the lounge as though as we are at home. Cozy and pleasant as experienced. Roberto the in house pianist is as always friendly and approachable at our visit. Roberto never fail to acknowledge the presence of the guests and made the stay as pleasant as possible with the in house music to accompany guests for the evening. Kudos #chihuly lounge. Keep up the good work

We had afternoon tea here last weekend, bought for us as a gift by some friends. The booking process was very easy and I just collected the voucher from the concierge upon arrival, so that was great.We arrived just before 2.30pm, which was the advertised start time. The food wasn't ready to go at 2.30, but not a big deal, it was only a 10-minute delay or so for the food, and they served us a delicious watermelon iced tea drink whilst we waited, so not a problem.Where the disappointment started was with the savoury food. The sandwiches were strange combinations (one was egg mayonnaise with air dried beef, another brie and asparagus, as examples), which I was surprised by. I would have expected closer attention to be paid to the flavour combinations, as has been my experience in other 5* afternoon tea establishments. The hot food was all cold, without exception. Wagyu Beef burgers with tomato salsa would have been absolutely delicious, if they had been served hot. The gyoza were cold and very tough and stodgy to eat. And that's just two examples. This was a huge let down given that we were in the Ritz Carlton. If an item is supposed to be served hot, then serve it hot!Where this afternoon tea really did redeem itself was with the desserts. There was a good selection and they were very tasty. Lots of delicious treat size bites to try from the dessert section and the scones with jam and clotted cream were a real treat. Honestly, had it not been for the delicious desserts, this would have scored a 1/5 for me.Overall, we were really underwhelmed by our experience. Having enjoyed afternoon tea at a variety of 5* hotels both around the world and here in Singapore, this was a disappointing performance from a high end luxury hotel like this, and honestly, I just expected better from a Ritz Carlton
4
Great food, great choices, lovely atmosphere & perfect setting for the 8 course mid-week afternoon tea. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because I asked twice for more tea but it was not forthcoming. Really enjoyed the experience, a tasty & varied feast, which lasted most of the afternoon. I also "upgraded" to include champagne for a few extra dollars & actually chose a French mojito - delicious
3
Ambience excellent, pianist excellent. Japanese staff service excellent. The rest service very average, Korean girl inexperienced. While we were waiting for a guest to come, we did not order drinks yet. There was no 2nd offer of service to order throughout the night. We sat there for 1.5hour & did not order a drink.
4
Jocelyn was the only staff that we were familiar with Tonight. Having attended to us only once previously, we are amazed that Jocelyn is able to remember our usual orders. As a regular patron of the lounge, such menial tasks made a difference for us. It made us feel welcome and at home... We are afraid that one day, we visit the lounge, the staff seems a total stranger to us. Thanks Jocelyn for being attentive to our needs tonight and always being warmth and friendly to us... Jocelyn, hospitality staff like yourself made a difference to us regular patron in coming back... We appreciate the effort that you put in. Your dedication and attention is commendable
5
A special way to start or end an evening (let's not forget afternoon tea though!). Relaxing and subtle live entertainment, intuitive service and very comfortable seating; surely one of the grandest "lobby bars" to be found anywhere
5
We got to the bar after a big dinner, and although it was a bit empty on a normal weekday, we very much enjoyed some quiet time. The pianist and the jazz singer were lovely, adding a special note to this relaxing ambience. We had lovely drinks and me personally I really liked this smooth and gentle cocktail (I forgot the name). The staff were friendly and gave us some space when needed.
4
The cakes were pretty and cute. The food was plenty. Too full to try all of the item even only one of each! Free-flow coffee/tea. Good service from the staff! A cosy environment with background live music. We'd love to be back!
4
Had high tea at Chihuly Lounge on 25 December. Like to commend Sharon and Rudy for their professionalism in their service, knowledge and service recovery.
Nice ambience and easy listening live music in the background.

This is my third time for Chihuly lounge and also third time for Ritz Carlton, Singapore.Actually this trip, i was very busy. On the first day, i arrived quite late. And then when I went near the lounge, i could hear the gorgeous voice. Just like a magic, i chose to go to the lounge instead of going up to the room.The singer (Robbie Danzie) and the pianist are very gorgeous. Robbie is a real divas.Her voice is pure, emotional and she can deliver all the message of the song through her voice. I really impressed with that. That's why i spent my two night at the lounge and enjoyed her music and enjoy our new friendship.Besides that, the staff at the lounge is very attentive to me, especially George. I really impressed with his service. I ordered first mocktail by myself which was too heavy for me. And then i asked him for the suggestion of the drink. And he suggest the best drink for me so far, which of course i try to order that again on my second night. (Unfortunately i cannot remember the name of that drink again ) During my relaxing time there, i could sense his hospitality and his service mind. He always asked whether the food is ok or not, the drink is ok or not.Unfortunately that the day i checked out, the seat for afternoon tea was fully booked. I really wish to have that again like last year.Therefore, from my experience, this is the best place in Singapore for relaxing time and for afternoon tea (everyone can read my review about afternoon tea here last year here in tripadvisor).Lastly, I would like to send my Thank You again to all the staffs at the Chihuly lounge and especially, Robbie, the pianist ( i am so sorry that i cannot remember his name) and George.I hope to see you again on my next trip to Ritz Carlton Singapore.Regards,Tinn

I have always felt welcome and felt like the lounge is a second home. Relaxing in the evening after work with the warmth and friendly service by Rudy, Sandrine, George, Joe, Martin,Regina and Angela is always great. The recommendations of food and the signature tea is always there for us when we visit the Lounge. The same level of eye to eye contact with the guest provided by the Chihuly Team was something that was unbelievable. The warmth, friendly and sincere service provided is always a warmth welcome.its deifinitly an awesome place I want to be with friends and loved ones after a hard day at work. Thank you guys for making each visit awesom
5
The Chihuly glass sculpture at each end of the hotel are very impressive. Great meeting place. Try the afternoon tea.
5
Came late for a drink but staff are very accomodating. Regina,Martin & Angela serve me with a smile eventhough it's a last minute order. Thank you for delighting me after a days work. Kudos to the team! :
5
We had a great time at afternoon tea at the Ritz-Carlton. Sharon and Regina looked after us well and were friendly and very polite. The food on offer was beautiful and there was so much as well as a selection of hot and iced teas! We will definitely be back again!

I went to the Chihuly Lounge with 3 friends for a special farewell lunch this week. We really liked the service we received from our server Frank. Right from the moment we arrived he was very attentive to our needs and made a real effort to make our event special. I appreciated both his Singaporean quirkiness and kindness. We had asked ahead for one meal to be no seafood and for one meal to be no seafood or egg. They had remembered this and Frank was very careful to point out which stand was for each of us. I felt that the courses were very heavy on the dessert side, which is great if you have a sweet tooth. But my friends and I felt we would have liked there to be one less sweet, and one more savory option. Perhaps even some cheese, or cheese and fruit towards the end (just before the chocolate & biscuit cart). Also because my friend and I asked for special dietary requirements ‚Äì the 7th course which came out was pretty much the same as one of the levels on our stand (berry parfait and poached pear). So we felt we had been served the same thing twice. The choice of champagne cocktails was very good (much better than at other high teas in Singapore) and the the inclusion into the price was very reasonable. One improvement might be to note on the menu that you can opt to have a plain glass of champagne if you prefer. The last of our group to arrive was told this, but by then the other three of us had already chosen a champagne cocktail
5
A very luxurious and exclusive lounge you must visit. Very welcoming staff made my visit valuable. Special thanks to Miss Regina, she made our visit unforgettable. Personally they have the best cocktail. Singapore sling is the one that you must have. Definitely we'll come back
5
Great Jazz music sang by Robbie and played by pianist Robert. A chill out lounge with cosy ambience and very helpful staff like Ms. Sandarine who made my birthday evening an memorable one !! Thank you all xx
5
The excellent services from the staffs. The environment is good. The foods are tasty. Its a good choice for u to come with families, couples, friends or colleagues.
5
We usually visit the Chihuly lounge to have the yummy hot chocolate. Lovely & polite service from Frank
5
If a five star hotel would have been my home I would have wanted Chihuly Lounge to be my personal Lounge forever.I have travelled round the world but such hospitality is unprecedented alongwith a decent Menu. Then there was Anesha ...This Charming young lady took our heart away with her personalised care to the extent that we visited the Lounge 3 nights back to back just to be taken care off by her. Anesha , you have a very bright future and wish you all the best. Thanks Chihuly and Thanks to Ritz Carlton for offering such a beautiful stay.----------Sachin Bhatia, New Delhi , Indi

Delicious and elegant tea with perfect service from Jessie plus a few chocolates for the trip to my room.
5
This is a great place to go. Fun, friendly, excellent service, and fantastic staff who great to talk to, and make you feel so welcome, especially Frank
5
The 8 course afternoon tea is so awesome, from the welcome drink right down to the selections of pralines and to add to the perfection of it, a 6 star service from Miss Liz . We will definitely be back again
5
This is my many visits to the lounge, the experience and the relaxing ambience never fail to impress me. Their cocktails, Lychees Martini is make to perfection and the best that I had tried. Today I experienced their foie gras sandwich for the first time and I will definitely go back for more. Their service is still one of the top range that I have experience in a hotel's lounge.
5
Staff was super attentive to me and my wife. This was our first trip and date night after our baby girl was born 3 months ago, and because of that, my wife needed to go back and forth between room and lounge to check on the baby. We ordered food and the food was delivered right after my wife was back. And in between staff came to check in and see how things were and asked if anything they could help to make our date more memorable. Singer and pianist were fantastic with the romantic and jazz songs.At the end, there was a staff called Frank, who has excellent and service attitude, came over and deliver a gift of 2 bears and a congratulating card. This is very sweet
5
I came here twice for afternoon tea and the staffs here never failed to amaze me with their attentive and friendly service. The food selection was quite good. Presentation was quite neat and overall the ambiance is comforting. I'd consider this tranquil place a go to if you want to feed your body with good food and relaxation.Special mention to Sharon and Dolly who have demonstrated impeccable service. They are quite interactive with guests and also made ensured that guests' needs were met. That was my experience on both occasion. Keep up the good work guys!
5
We were a party of 3 with one allergy mango. Got excellent service from Dolly. She is very attentive and helpful. All of the food were explained by her in detail. Many thank
5
We had the Aperitivo Tradition recently. The service from Rudi and his staff was excellent.
The selection of nibbles to go with the drinks are paired excellently. A great place to go before a late dinner.
5
It was really good service and good taste!! Thanks to Regina, Dix and Jocelyn. They were really good care of us! And It also was good about the food. We ordered afternoon desert and tea.

We were served by Anesha and Jocelyn. Service was professional yet at the same time, each individual servers had their own personality which were pleasant and shone through. The service was attentive yet not intrusive.Ambience was fantastic - there was live music played by a pianist. A great way to spend time as a couple or with your family.Foodwise, I liked the beef, wagyu beef as well as the salmon. More of a savoury chap here while my wife enjoyed the pastries which showed a certain technical skill in creating.The only thing I thought could be improved was us being served the 6th and 7th dishes (sorbet i think) by a male, while we were still having our 3rd to 5th dishes. Was not sure if that's part of protocol as we suddenly had quite a bit on the table.Finally, whilst making payment, Anesha was very kind to point out which credit card had discounts for their lounge. Overall, the staff and organization at Chuhily Lounge were very well trained! Thanks for the great experience
5
The seating area is lovely with 8 courses on offer. The staff are lovely and Regina was particularly helpful. You are given a savoury starter with various other courses including chocolates and cakes. Although the variety of tea is less than some other hotels offer they do offer a wide range of iced teas, which I have not seen elsewhere
5
High tea was terrific. Thanks to Dix and the others on the team for very professional and attentive service. A very impressive range of goodies available.

Have heard about a lot of positive feedbacks regarding the foods and service from Ritz Carlton and decided to bring my friend over and tried one of the famous high teas in Singapore @ Chuhuly Lounge. Initially i was very excited to show and introduce my friend about the high tea at Ritz Carlton. However, overall dining experience was not up to our expectation or below our expectation. Just a small suggestion, a "hostess stand" should be located somewhere visible or in front of Chuhuly Lounge as we were lost upon arrival. We stood somewhere around the Lounge and did not know if we should inform the staff about our reservation or we simply choose our seat by ourself. Few minutes later, we were notified by manager and he seated us, Immediately, he explained the concept of the " high tea " and one of the staff offered us a glass of "welcome drink" each. Coffee/ Tea order was taken and served. Everything went well at the beginning, However, after that, we were being neglected. No service was provided(Ritz Carlton's Service Standard??) Plates were not cleared promptly. Hence, we stacked our dirty plates on our table. I know that it is bad manners to stake dirty plates for wait staff to clear from the table but we waited for like 10-15mins, no one came even though we already had 3 rounds of buffet. we could understand if the restaurant is busy but it was not. And we hardly get the attention from the wait staff whenever we need further assistance maybe simply because we were seating at the corner?? coffee/tea cups were left empty. "last call" of buffet should be informed 15 mins before closing, not 2 mins. The moment we got up and wanted to take more foods, plates and service gears on the counter were all cleared. Staff should be more aware of the service standards. Food wise is fine. Compliments for the desserts and the scallops. *Not trying be a fussy guest.* Been trying out Ritz Carlton signature service from other countries, and that is why we expect the same and consistent service standard as other Ritz Carltons would have provided
3
Had coffee with a friend here. Service is slow...there is only 2 tables.. Although service is slow, they are professional...
5
Planned for a surprise proposal for my fiancee. The staff are all very friendly and helpful ! I was allowed to use the piano at the lounge for the proposal and I was even allowed to practice the night before my actual proposal. Anya has helped me with the reservation and has even decorated the area just for my proposal. Food was good even though there wasn't a lot to offer for dinner on a saturday night. Had a wonderful experience and I would like to use this chance to thank all the staff who were present that day for helping me with the setup and for giving me the support I need for the proposal
3
I must say that the service was good with at least a 4/5 but the tea spread I gave a 3/5. I like the strawberry with yogurt drink, the scones, the tiny breads(i'm not sure how to describe them) and the calamansi sorbet. I find the pastries, cookies and chocolates average. Also, consider including other choices of meat for those who do not prefer beef. Overall it is still a great place for afternoon tea with a few friends.
5
Chihuly is a hotel lounge that lives up to all that fine dining can promise--and that without reservation (no pun intended)! The food is very delectable, with a very posh ambience to boot. I especially have fond memories of the staff; in particular, Dix, Penny, Anesha, and the manager Rubi. Their professionalism is matched only by their sincere human qualities, such as warmth, good sense of humour, and just overall congeniality. There is also live music at night, which I enjoyed very much while gulping down my favourite hot chocolat
5
The Assistant Manager of the Chihuly lounge, Sandrine Qu was exceptionally kind to treat my husband and I to the most amazing hotel experience in our room courtesy of the Chihuly Lounge with a number of her staff including Hyung Jin her Chef, Martin her Bartender and 2 interns working in Chihuly, Penny & Dix. All 5 staff came to our room and gave us a food and drinks presentation that was out of this world. Hyung Jin made us the most mouth watering canapes from some of the finest ingredients, that are also available for guests in the Lounge.Martin gave us a fabulous presentation on the history of the Singapore sling and showed us how they are painstakingly made, individually by hand, in the Lounge with a new twist. They were delicious! We have had Singapore Slings in Raffles, however they are pre-made and you can really tell by the taste. Try the Ritz they really are superior. Both Sandrine and Martin make exceptional Singapore Slings having tasted a few!After the presentation was over they left us with our beautiful food and a few drinks for us to relax and enjoy.In all of the places we have stayed we have never experienced this level of hospitality.You cannot go past the Ritz Carlton for incredible service especially in the Chihuly Lounge
5
we were stayed Ritz carlton hotel in May It was nice and gorgeous. All staff were all excellent and very kindly. morning buffet food and service was wonderful. Regina makes me happy and recommend some place for us. Thank you regina for care of us . All in all a very good experience and a nice touch from hotel
5

Service was friendly and wonderful. the tea recommended by Regina who has good smile and take care of us. And smile man (not sure name.. i show Di.) and peenny also very hospitality. all in all a fabulous experience with great service. I will happily come again. Thank you for your warm welcome.ÎÑàÎ¨¥ Í∞êÏÇ¨ÌñàÏäµÎãàÎã§.
5
We usually have drinks at the lounge whenever we stay at Ritz Singapore. Every time we visit the place, they make us feel home along with live music and variety of drinks. I was, especially, impressed with service by servers. Thank you Katie for your hospitality when we were there
5
First time in Chihuly lounge with my mom and her best friend. We ordered cocktails and experienced the best service that exceed my expectations ,the staff-Dix(?) is really nice to us, he recommend the drinks with his cute smile. I am sure I will come back to Chihuly lounge again.
5
I've had a fair share of afternoon teas while living in London (Claridges, Ritz, Mad Hatters @Sandersons, Fortnum and Mason and many more) and I didn't think I'd be able to find one that matches up to the English standards back in Singapore until my friend introduced me to the ones at Chihuly Lounge. This was honestly one of the best afternoon teas I've had here in Singapore and the selections offered for $50 was pretty justifiable. My friend and I however, took a stronger liking towards the sweet treats rather than the savoury. Even so, the attentive staff were quick in providing alternatives.Overall, the service was exceptional and our needs were seamlessly taken care of during this lovely time at the Ritz. Would highly recommend this place
5
An exquisite room to spend a couple of hours in, sipping tea and sampling delicious bites. The service was excellent. Everyone in the hotel was very attentive and spent time telling us about the hotel and it's art collection. The set menu for the high tea is reasonable at 49 s$ but the alcohol is very expensive
5
10 March 2016Hi-tea at Rizt-Carlton Millenia in Singapore. No no no, this is not a food review. I went with my Girlfriend for "me time"... It's SDG$49++ and after paying with Citibank visa, it's about $55 per person net. The scones were fantastic...cos the cream was the great accompaniment... The place was quiet when We reached ... And very fast it was full house even on a weekday afternoon. As what I know, their service was excellent... The only draw back was the salmon something! The base tasted weird n my Friend saw my funny look while eating it... The next moment I took my tea. I feedback to the waitress who happen to be a Korean with fluent mandarin speaking skill. ... I told her This " let your Chef knows Asian definitely cannot accept this salmon base, it tasted horrible." I'm not a fussy or picky person but d smoke salmon base is definitely out... A feedback help to improve service level and I believe this is a positive fdbk. I like the hi-tea personalised service which is rather special... At the start was serve by Esther with excellent delivery skill and after that d rest of the team were equally good. In all, there's a welcome drink with a salmon plus truffle herb sauce, follow by the hi-tea tier with 4scones, cheese roll, eclair,tomato sandwich bun, ham n cheese sandwich, beef burger sandwich, passionfruit tart, macaron plus sherbet n 10 other choice of assorted cookies, truffles, pralines , sweet cakes and lapis... Oh not forgetting my pot of tea. The ambience was one of my main sentiment I will return again for buffet lunch soon.... Believe my point... I suggest to change the salmon base with a baguette or biscotti... So be sure it will change soon... And thanks to Ellen the Korean waitress who took effort to feedback to the Chef in the kitchen. I hope to return again in 3-4mths time to taste the hi-tea again. Thanks for d great service. Special thanks to Esther, Ellen and the service team for their attentive and excellent service.

Celebrated UK mother's day with afternoon tea at the Chihuly Lounge. The selection and quality of food was great, but where the Ritz-Carlton really shines is the service. I happened to mention in passing to one of the waiting staff that my daughter had just turned one a few days ago. Not only did one of the waiters bring her a complimentary teddy bear, but they also treated her to a mini birthday cake and a rendition of happy birthday.The staff here do everything they can to make the experience special, and their attention to detail is just incredible. I think it reflects really well on the Ritz-Carlton that they don't just extend this kind of service to hotel guests, but also to those who dine there.The six stars are truly deserved. Would definitely return
5
We went to the Chihuly Lounge for high tea buffet as a family to celebrate our son's first birthday. We were impressed by the wide range of both savory dishes and desserts available - savory dishes ranges from Western to Asian to Japanese, and over ten types of desserts (and a chocolate tart stand where you could choose your own toppings and ice cream on the side).Seating was comfortable - we had a nice sofa to lounge on, and a baby chair was provided to us on request. There was a nice and relaxing ambiance with live music and plenty of space between tables.What deserves special mentioning was the incredibly helpful staff. Within half an hour of us being there, out of the blue, our baby started crying inconsolably. The manager at the restaurant (sorry I forgot his name!) went out of his way to find me a room in the business centre for me to nurse my baby. Even though that didn't help calm my baby down, the manager got my baby a balloon and a little toy to try cheer him up! Other members of staff also came up to offer their help. It did make for a memorable experience when the staff started singing 'Happy Birthday' with a birthday cake in front of my crying baby :) I can't thank the staff there enough - even though it wasn't the entirely joyful experience we were expecting it did leave us thoroughly impressed with the service at Chihuly lounge

I have afternoon tea at the Chihuly lobby lounge. The staffs there (Ellen and Penny) are terrific. I really appreciate their hospitality. Their service is superb and over expectation. The afternoon tea set is really fabulous and delicious.I really admire the musicianship of the pianist too (I also play the piano).I am sure to come back here again for my next trip to Singapore

The 8 course sugar rush is an amazing experience. The welcome drink had a unique and refreshing taste to awaken the taste buds on an afternoon:) Really love the following: Macaroons. Not over sweet at all given that I'm not a great fan of really sweet macaroons. Must try.Scones. Really fluffy taste to it. Had it with honey and cream which comes with it. A cappuccino with it makes it a perfect match. The service staff were amazing. Thumbs up to them. Really friendly and had a personal touch too. The service staff, Ellen, helped change my plate of beef into tomato base pasta without me even needing to request. Thoughtful. This visit is surely worth the calories.

I visited Chihuly lounge for weekend afternoon tea buffet with a very high expectation for its fame in luxurious accommodation in Singapore as well as the general perception to in-hotel dining. I found that the overall quality of foods were very dissapointing--especially, I couldn't find any favorite selection from hot food. Sandwiches and desserts were better than hot food. Regardless of these facts, I love the tea recommended by Ellen, who was willing to help us at any time with her kindness, and the atmosphere with a live music. Do I want to come back for afternoon tea set at here again? Maybe not.

We made a reservation for high tea to celebrate my husbands birthday. There was a spread of tasters and sandwiches and ice cream . The spread were more like finger food during cocktails . The only thing I like were the sweets which were nicely adorned
5
Actually I tried 4 times to book here from Dec 2015, but unfortunately always fully booked. Finally I can be here today. I really like Singapore afternoon tea and usually I enjoy it so I think I've been almost afternoon tea house in Singapore. Chihuly Lounge is one of the best afternon tea house in Singapore.Food, drink, tea wear and atmosphere are all good, and the staffs are really kind and nice. Especially one Korean staff, Miss Ellen is the best, she is really kind and helpful. She totally understand guests' needs. Thanks to her, we can have a wonderful time

Brought my friend from India and Thailand to The Ritz Carlton hotel and they was impressed by Rudi's service and positive attitude. He went his way to take the little initiative to go out his way to help us. My friends loves him very much.
5
Staffs r super nice and friendly especially Rudi. He was nice enough to come up and hold an interesting conversation.Best manager Chihuly could ever have!

went for the Winter high tea session and the Chihuly Lounge is one top-notch place to go to. Sink yourself into the huge couches and let yourself be pampered by the dainty food, impeccable service and soft mesmerising live music accompanied with saxophone (YES!) and piano. First up was a complimentary freshly squeezed watermelon juice served to each diner. We also got to choose either tea or coffee from the menu. Perhaps they could increase the limit of 1 beverage to 2?? given that the tea became more diluted after each refill... I was thrilled to find huge poached scallop (as big as my palm) with fish roe on the buffet line! The scallop sat so elegantly in its comfort zone, flanked by little fish roes caressing its thick juicy flesh. It begged to be devoured within seconds and needless to say, delivered an explosion of flavours in my mouth. The egg cocotte on the other hand, was stuffed with chopped mushrooms and a runny egg that threatened to engulf its counterparts. There was also mini sandwiches that were akin mini time bombs to burst your waistline and raisin scones that came with smooth velvety clotted cream and jam! Desserts were extremely exquisite. Kudos to the pastry chefs who showed no restraint in each and every one of them, as though preparing them for a pageant contest. Overall, service was impeccable with tables cleared promptly and really polite staffs

The food is pretty good, the right mix of West and East. And when the counter ran out of Dimsum, Anya helpfully and cheerfully brought to my table my very own selection
5
The Chihuly Lounge has always been a favourite place of mine to unwind. The ambience is good. The live pianist and songstress are pleasing to the ear. The coffee, tea, and food very satisfying, and above all, the service staff are attentive and friendly. A hidden gem in my opinio
5
Just had the most wonderful experience staying in this area. Staff are accommodating and very friendly. Keep it up! See you again soon!

My friend and I decided to have tea after our massage session and we decided on Chihuly Lounge at Ritz Carlton after much debate comparing it to the nearby hotels which also offer Afternoon tea. We were greeted by smiley staffs the moment we entered the compound and we were very well received by all. We were expecting a classic 3-tier tea set but were informed that the 3-tier is only available on weekdays. So do take note of that if you are intending to take pictures with a 3-tier tea set against the elegant backdrop! The hot dishes as well as the desserts are very rich in flavor and it goes very well with the tea selection. I would like to take this opportunity to praise 2 of the staffs at Chihuly Lounge and they are Anya and Angeline. Anya took the time off to share with us the chihuly glass sculpture perched atop the ceiling when we asked about it and even gave us a brochure to the various arts installations within the Ritz property. It is the Ritz honor to have such staffs who goes the extra mile in sharing the little details in the hotel which most guests might probably have overlooked. Angeline, is very genuine in her service and made small talks with us, ensuring that what we are happy with the whole experience (indeed it was!) and treated us like long lost friends instead of the fine line drawn between staffs and the patrons. I am very satisfied with the whole experience and would love to visit it again- as i believe that if 2 of the staffs execute exceptional professional service to us, the rest will be the same standard or even better. Keep it up

Food was great! There was a variety of selection to choose which is a plus! Ambience was nice! Service staffs were always on the go and very friendly. Had a very pleasant meal with my family. Definitely recommend anyone who wants to give it a try!!!!! :

I was at the Chihuly Lounge during my weekend in Singapore and was impressed by the service and the friendly staffs. The atmosphere is really nice to have a cup of ice chocolate during afternoon and I highly recommended to visit if you have a chance to come to Singapore. jo

Glamorous decor. The food and drinks is good. The service provided is impeccable but they need more staff to be the best. A bit pricy!
5
Great food! Great service! Great people! Great environment! Great ambience! Everything is just great! Always fully booked for afternoon tea which is a must to have at chihuly lounge!First class!
3
If you have other options, give this a miss. Portions of the dessert section was too big and hence we felt too full to try out all. Unlike other hotel's high tea buffe, kinda disappointed with Chihuly that there's only one choice of beverage, a change would cost SGD10. Service is very prompt and professional but I'm afraid this would be my first and last visit.
3
The taste was good but a bit deceptive considering the price. The atmosphere of the lounge was othewise beautiful
5
we have enjoyed our breakfast at the Chihuly Lounge for three days which I didn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t expect, because we always have breakfast outside instead of having buffet breakfast in the hotel. The main point which I love to enjoy my breakfast at the hotel this time was their fantastic service and the restaurant manager, he was so nice and gentle.
4
I was staying at the Ritz Carlton hotel for a few days weekend works. I had a nice lunch and several breakfast here. The foods were fresh and to my liking and the service was excellent. Love this lounge for lunch and breakfast
5
The lounge has a wonderful view of Marina Bay. The staff is so very polite you do not feel like leaving once you are there.

Beautiful artwork and nice staff. Pleasant environment, comfortable chairs. Tea time on Sunday with tons of cute kids

The reservation process should have been a clue to what the experience would be like, as it took 2 days and 2 phone calls to try and confirm a booking. Having had a fantastic high tea at the Fullerton Bay Hotel a few days before, we were expecting the Ritz-Carlton to be as good or even better, but it was surprisingly a very poor experience.The service was some of the worst we experienced in Singapore, there seemed to be plenty of staff but they were disorganised and unattentive. I understand High Tea is meant to be a leisurely experience, but waiting 25 minutes for our first tea to be served and 45 minutes before food came out was disappointing. The food itself was OK, but certainly not anything to get excited about, the savoury options in particular were quite limited and not very flavoursome. The poor service continued right till the end when it took 25 minutes just to settle the check. When I mentioned the disappointing service to our waiter, she responded "I hope we can serve you better next time". Unfortunately, there won't be a next time

My family and I came here for high tea with great expections that we would have a great time like we had at Brown's Hotel high tea in London.We were terribly wrong and disappointed.While the ambience and setting at Chihuly Lounge was spectacular, the food was pretty good and the staff were professional, this restaurant has serious issue with the running of its operations.We noticed that some diners were served welcome drink and crackers. We requested for ours repeatedly and waited for about 25 minutes for ours to arrive.The first course came about 15 minutes after we sat down. We requested for coffee and tea and was told that it would come in the second course. At Brown's, the wait staff took our beverage orders soon after we were seated and served them very promptly.Our tea and coffee came about 45 minutes after we sat down. This was despite repeated requests and a complaint to the restaurant manager.The restaurant manager response to our complaint was arrogant and outrageous indifference. Basically he gave us a perfunctory response to get us out of his way.So an otherwise lovely and elegant high tea experience became a frustrating and aggravating period of repeated requests for our food and drinks to be serve as well as unreasonably long waiting periods. During our long waits, we noticed that some diners who arrived after us were served before us.When our multi tier trays of high tea savouries and desserts arrived, we noticed that the portion served was for four diners. We ordered five high tea for five diners.For what Ritz charges for this high tea and its reputation, it is not unreasonable for one to expect fine food, impeccable service and a memorable experience. That was exactly what we got at the Brown's Hotel in London.Instead, we witness chaos, unreasonable long waits, and service with an attitude from the restaurant manager. This is one high tea with a very low enjoyment

The four stars is for the generally good food. We had a weekend hi-tea and the relatively small spread (about 20 dishes) can be ploughed through easily if you are hungry. The decor and furniture is overly pompous and not so functional, but oh so comfortable and pretty. Bushes and plants and pillars get in your way of food so you have to navigate quite a bit. If you're a group of 4, be prepared to shout in order for your friend to hear you over the long table. The live band was belting out tunes at the top of their voice(s) like there was no tomorrow. The iced tea choices weren't great and tasted artificial, but the hot teas were nice. Loved the tuna, beef, 'otah' and salmon dishes. There are nicer places, but hey, some times it's all about the company. Recommended for just 2 people who are easily satisfied, or a group of 6 (max) to fully use the luxurious sofa
5
I stayed there just 4days though, our family could spend really great time thanks to Vanh! we were really surprised and felt comfortable for your hospitality and smile. Needless to say delicious drinks and food. I hope we will be able to visit there soon

Returned home last month from our stay in Ritz Carlton Singapore. What a wonderful time I and my husband had, and a staff in Chihuly Lounge made our trip even more special. We came down to lobby lounge after a long flight from Switzerland to Singapore and a staff approached us "Welcome to Chihuly Lounge ...", she kept smiling and asked whether we want sofa seats or normal chairs. After helping me pulling the chairs and checking that we were totally comfortable with our seats, the staff brought the menu, explained it and introduced herself as Vanh, and we started "chit-chat" for awhile before she assisted other guests. After she left, me and my husband opened the menu to look for the food but it was quite dark so I asked my husband open the flashlight. While my husband was trying to open the flash light, Vanh already came to our table with her biggest smile and two tiny clip lights in her hands. She said sorry to me because she did not pay attention that I am a short-sighted person. And I was so pleased with her careness. During our dine-in time in the lounge, we started sharing to Vanh more about our plan and she gave us a must-go list in Singapore with her lovely handwriting. I told Vanh that me and my husband want to travel somewhere else near Singapore but we have no idea about neither the visa nor places. And she said "Please give me a moment, I will get back to you soon." Around 10 minutes later, Vanh came back with some documents and she said "Zahra and Hjalmar, sorry for making you waiting, I have just collect some information about Sweden Passport holder and the good news is you can travel to nearby countries very easily. I also ask for help form the concierge to list down some good places in Malaysia and Indonesia for your references ..."WOW, we just knew each other for a few hours and she made me felt like we are good friends for a long time. She really really made our day and we totally forgot about our jet lag and tireness. I wrote this review to give Vanh a BIG THANKYOU for what she did and I wish her all the best in her future! - Zahra and Hjalma

I have never felt the urge to give a negative feedback before but the high tea at chihuly lounge was really a disappointment! While the savoury items were relatively good though lacking in variety, the dessert items were downright horrible! The theme for the high tea is Spring 2015. And for some strange reason, the chef has envisioned all the desserts in different shades of pink and red! I felt like I was attending a young girl's birthday party and not at a sophisticated high tea at Ritz. I would have been able to overlook the absurdly pink aesthetics if the desserts even tasted good. To my horror they tasted exactly the same! Strawberry/raspberry/rose/pink tasting cake, tart, panna cotta, pound cake and many other similar berry/rose tasting desserts. It's like eating the same dessert multiple times! Where is the variety that comes with a high tea buffet? The only non berry/rose item was the chocolate and vanilla ice cream, which my companion and I had extra helpings of.For someone who doesn't like berries, this is the ultimate nightmare having nothing else to eat but berry desserts (apart from the chocolate and vanilla ice cream). Having to pay $58++ for only one dessert is really a joke

I stayed in Ritz Carlton for 5 days and it was on my last day that I went to Chihuly Lounge for the afternoon Tea. It was an amazing 8 course, the staffs are really friendly and nice. I couldn't say the food is amazing, however the service that they give me was absolutely great! The lounge was full of guests during this afternoon Tea, but the great thing was the staffs still go around and checked on the guests one by one which made me feel touched.Let me share a bit of my experience, that time I dropped my fork when I was going to eat the Beef Wellington, I haven't even asked them to change, a staff came approached me and changed my fork. I was quite surprised and we talked for a while, her name is Martha, she always smile and she took care of us really well. She explained the 8 course to us and told us what are our next course. She also offered me to take photo with my friends, because honestly I was shy to ask people to take photo.When the sixth or seventh course (I forgot it was 6th/7th), which was the lime sorbet came, I was outside smoking. By the time I came, I hold the white cone for sorbet and eat it, I realized that the sorbet was melting. My hands became very sticky, however I was wearing stiletto and I didn't know where is the toilet. I never expect that somebody paid attention to me, then I was surprised by Martha. She came and gave me wet towel. She said: "This is wet towel for you Miss Rose, I saw you trying to clean your hand with the food napkin, but I think wet towel will work better. Or do you want to go to the ladies, if you don't mind I can show you the way". I was really really impressed by this young lady! Then I told her that wet towel is more than enough because I was wearing my new stiletto and it's a bit hard to walk. Actually I wanted to say thank you very much to her, however when I was leaving, I couldn't be able to find her.Next visit to Singapore, I will go to Chihuly Lounge and find her to say thank you for her caring. Singapore became my favourite country recently, I like the diversity there, so I definitely will come back. I had tried four afternoon hi-tea in four different hotels and Chihuly Lounge is the best! I just want to highlight that their service make them different from others. Keep it up

Have been coming here for the past 5 years or so, always for the weekend teas. Friends I've brought here have also since become regular patrons - simply because the tea does not disappoint. Chihuly serves up an excellent range of epicurean delights every weekend, and they change up the repertoire every few months so you don't get bored. They also carry a comprehensive collection of teas (free flow, as with the coffee) which is always fun to explore. Service is always attentive and on point; one of the rare places where I've not had issues with service before. Be sure to make a reservation, and ask for the couches by the windows

Well presented, Delicious afternoon tea. Good selection of cakes and cookies. Staff attentive but unobtrusive.

Just had High Tea in the Chihuly Lounge at the Ritz Carlton Millenia, Singapore and it was fabulous. The service was beyond exquisite and the food was simply great.
Many thanks to all the staff for a very warm welcome and truly wonderful time.

Lovely kind staff eager to attend to your every need, couldn't fauly anything or anybody, the lady and gentleman on the piano were so lovely, not overpowering at all, with such lovely smiles

Went for hi tea at Chihuly lounge with family. Was expecting great food after reading all the bloggers' reviews but it certainly did not meet so. Service also greatly falls short of expectation. Half of the group arrived first and after placing our orders for the drinks, we were served with the welcome drink, our selected beverage as well as some crackers even before the rest of the guests arrived. The remaining of the party arrived and placed their drinks order with the staff. However, only 1 out of 4 drinks were served promptly and the other 3 drinks were only served after 2 long reminders! The lounge was not packed with guests on boxing day, however, refills of beverage was slow and forgotten even after informing the staff... Next, we were served with the 1st main course, which was roast turkey with cranberry sauce. Booking was for 6 adults and 2 children, however, only the adults were served with the roast turkey. Checked with 1 of the staff if the course for the children was different and after a short while, they came back and apologized and served the same for the kids. How can the staff be so inattentive? The last course was a sorbet and after a long wait, no sorbet was served. We decided to settle the bill and while we were on the way out, we were then told that sorbet was yet to served. I'm wondering why this was not communicated when we asked for the bill? In any case, we did not stay to finish the sorbet as the tea had not been great. I do hope that the management will work and improve on the service standard

Hello! A girlfriend and I (~30yr olds) pre-booked an Afternoon Tea at Chihuly for our last day in Singapore. We have done about ~16 High Teas between us at major hotels in Australia and overseas so we're quite addicted! The Afternoon Tea at Chihuly will set you back $49++SGD on a weekday. This includes a fruity sparkling cocktail but I also got an extra pinot grigio for ~$25++. We arrived almost 1.5hrs before our 2:30pm sitting but we were seated immediately at our lounge seats to relax until it began. Joseph looked after us from start to finish controlling the sitting from first course right through to the end. He was very attentive and professional. Felix was also on hand to deliver some courses and explain the menu. The boys were not shy to make small talk with us either! The Chihuly Lounge is exactly that - it's a massive lounge space with a lounges (instead of sit down tables) for a casual yet elegant sitting. The Ritz Carlton oozes luxury rather than the neo-Renaissance d√É¬©cor of Raffles. There were 2 people sitting the Afternoon Tea outside but I doubt it would've had the same feel as sitting inside in air con. Pro's; 8 courses! Course 1 - Crackers (prawn & pork) with sweet & sour sauce and sour creamCourse 2 - Small palm-sized but thick piece of Steak (medium rare) with what tasted like a crumbed Truffle seasoning! (bonus points for this!!!) Course 3/4/5 - 3 Tiers of mini sandwiches in various breads and fillings, cakes and scones with cream & jam. Course 6 - Strawberries & CreamCourse 7 - Lime sorbet!Course 8 - Buffet cart of biscuits and mini cakes Although controlled with courses and full waiting service, it is still filling. Endless Tea and/or coffee for 1 included & wine is extra Pianist in the background The scones were nice and soft in comparison to some hard and doughie types had in the pastBeing a weekday sitting, in a big space and no walking around necessary, it was peaceful and sedate. Good value for $49 ++ especially with the steak! Cons:For those who like a bottomless feed, there is no buffet at this dignified afternoon tea. If the sandwiches were ribbon sandwiches - I would've given this 5 stars! Happy travel

We had such a nice time here had to add review straight away.When we first got to hotel people opened the doors for us. We were seated at our table then the food and beverage started. The attention to detail was the best I have seen for sometime. Very friendly and professional. The high tea consisted of 8 courses.More than we could eat but we certainly tried our best.We have tried several high teas in Singapore each time we travel here this one is the best so far.To make it even more special we were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and as an extra we were given champagne a photo and a ritz teddy. If that wasnt enough was followed by a selection of sorbets .Even without the extra would have high Teahere again. Thank you to all the staf

Well, the price doesn't seem to be on par with my experience eating there. the food portion and quality has dropped over the couple of times I had visited. I went there for high tea. Every couple of months, they will change their menu from Christmas to summer etc, food choices are minimal. Don't expect a wide variety, the quality is average but the service is remarkable. Also, busk in the live music played there. I won't go back there any time soon as there are better out there
5
The chihuly glass is a marvel to see, but the prices are very high from the tea to the wine (5x the cost of a bottle at DFS at the airport)If you are staying at the Ritz, pick up a few bottles at Changi airport and put in your room fridge

Visited the high tea buffet on a Sunday afternoon after reading some good reviews of Chihuly Lounge but from the moment of arrival things were a let down. First of all there was no clear entrance to the 'lounge' it was an open space next to the hotel reception areas. We had to try a couple of times to determine where was the best spot to get the staff's attention to let them know we had a reservation.Drink choices were limited and we had to ask staff three times before our tea was finally served to us. One of the main problems was that it was very understaffed especially for a weekend and we had to try hard to get someone's attention. The worst part of the buffet was that the dessert platters were all empty! This was at 3pm in the afternoon when the buffet is still supposed to be at the peak hour! Staff finally came out carrying a tray of less than 10 pieces of cake and since this was the only choice, of course the cake was quickly snapped up. It was really bad how patrons of the high tea had to mill around the dessert area waiting and as soon as anything was put out on the dessert trays, they had to quickly help themselves before the items were finished again. I mean this is supposed to be the Ritz-Carlton, and not some cheap buffet place! It is really a disgrace to charge $58++ which is higher than most hotel high teas and provide such a pathetic spread
5
A fantastic experience shared with my wife.Great High Tea,Staff were fantastic,The Lounge and rest of the Hotel was superb!Apparently the Ritz has an audio tour that you can use to take a tour of all of the fantastic Art Works that are situated around the Hotel, if we were aware of this before-hand we would of made time either before or after the High Tea to add to the experience.I definitely recommend the Chihuly Lounge
5
Didn't eat or drink there as in Club lounge but saw nightly entertainment with a Jazz Blues singer and piano player very cool.
5
We had a very nice high tea here. Very nice selection for the buffet high tea time on the weekend. I also had a very nice foie gras club sandwich here at night. Only downside is the disappointing bourbon selection from the bar.

Decided to come for afternoon tea at the chihuly lounge after reading all the marvelous reviews it got online. I had previously been to the chi hilt lounge but not for tea and I was looking forward to it. My wife and I were placed beside the window and it offered a little more privacy and it's perfect for couples wanting to enjoy their conversations while having tea at the same time. The afternoon tea set at the chihuly lounge came with 8 courses. The usual suspects such as scones, cakes and other sweets were there and you also got either salmon or beef Wellington depending on whether you are here this week or next since they alternate between the two each week. Service was excellent as what you would expect from the ritz Carlton. Our requests were promptly met and staff were friendly and courteous. Overall a wonderful experience and I look forward to being back again.

I went there for a high tea on a friday afternoon.Service was great, staff were courteous & helpful. There is a pianist playing pieces live in the lounge.It was my birthday that day, the staff gathered around & sang me a short birthday song accompanied by the pianist. Thought it was sweet. Ambience is relaxing but, very frequently there are flies around. Maybe it came from the plants around the lounge. But it was alittle annoying having to keep an eye on your lovely cakes and food & tea from them. Didnt really expect to have to fan off the flies at such a hotel high tea
4
Came here to celebrate a galfrd's birthday and my first time trying the hi-tea since so many reviews.Firstly the long table makes it hard for the four of us to talk. The interesting hi-tea palate tasted so-so, not as great as what we thought. The scone & sandwiches were ok while the rest of the pastries were a bit too sweet for my liking.Overall nice experience but will consider another visit

So, after a hiatus from high tea indulgences, I finally managed to get *Charliez to go to Chihuly Lounge with me for afternoon high tea. Having heard good reviews about it from several sources, we both harbored rather high expectations. The lounge was comfortably done in rich earthly tones, complete with elegant furniture and plush carpetings, a pianist playing beautiful music to provide a soothing ambience, and rather attentive service crew constantly fluttering around our table.The First Course and Second Course were served once we were settled down - Passion Fruit Mocktails and a bowl of crackers - lobster crackers, fish crackers and kale chips. While the cocktails were cooling and tasty with its blend of sweet-sour overtures, we were a little surprised that these crackers formed part of the set. The XO chilli sambal dip was rather tasty though.Next, the Beef Wellington is from their Carving Station next to the glass window - served with horseradish cream and Port Wine Jus. The beef was very tender and well-marinated in a delicious Port Wine Jus - juicy and flavorful. The pastry skin around the beef was so thin it melted in the mouth.The 4th-5th courses came in a three-tiered tray, consisting of an assortment of sweet pastries and tiny sandwiches. The miniature pastries looked tantalizing, and the waitress explained to us what each item was in detail after setting it down upon our table.On the top tier lay two different types of Scones - the ones with tiny raisins and the plain ones. These were the fluffiest, softest scones I have ever came across - unlike the hard ones I was accustomed to. These had the texture of tarts, except looser, and tasted very lovely. The light dusting of powdered sugar atop the pastries added hints of sweetness to the fragrant pastries. We enjoyed the scones very much, especially eaten with their homemade butter.For more detailed information and photos, do check out:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/02/high-tea-at-chihuly-lounge-ritz-carlton.htm

Late afternoon drinks and relaxation and we discovered the slowest possible service in Singapore. It would be less expensive and aggravating to take a cab over to the Harbor Marina and find a place for drinks and such

Visited the Chihuly lounge this weekend for afternoon tea. Given the Chihuly is part of Ritz Carlton we were expecting great things. The food overall was very good with the only issue being the slightly limited choice. And lack of originality in the menu. Savories were a series of different small sandwiches and rolls with some Shumai and other small plates of salmon, etc. There was a chef serving up French toast with ice cream and some lovely small scones which were available with clotted cream and lovely jam. For sweets again there was a mixture, although I have to say, not many tasted that good. Which I accept may be a personal preference. All this was accompanied by many choices of tea, coffee or hot chocolate. We were impressed with the level and attentiveness of the service which was first class. There is a pianist and a saxophonist that play during the afternoon. Total bill for two persons was $112 (including a discount for Citibank cards) which may sound pricey to some, but given we never felt like eating for the rest of the day, was an inexpensive option to an evening meal. Paffy's Tip:Ask for a table next to the window or if there are a few of you, on one of the sofa's that line the edge of the room. The tables down the centre are a bit more crammed together and give a different feel to the afternoon

We went to the Ritz Carlton to celebrate my hubby's birthday. Unfortunately I did not make a reservation and The Greenhouse where we had originally intended to dine in was packed. The friendly staff recommended the Chihuly Lounge. Since we were already there, we went to the chihuly lounge, half-hearted actually. Needless to say, our mood was affected. So I ordered fish and chips, not bothered anymore. Hubby had his steak. However, we were in for a pleasant surprise. The staff at the Chihuly Lounge were so warm and went out of the way to make us feel comfortable. They served us good bar nuts to go with our drinks. Dinner was awesome. The humble fish and chips was of excellent quality, served with mushy peas by the way. The traditional sytle! Hubby's steak was cooked to perfection, the way he likes it. medium well. And at the end of dinner, the staff gathered around us and sang him the birthday song, the pianist accompanying them in the background. Really made our dining experience special. No regrets at all

I regret to say this was probably one of the most disappointing experiences in Singapore so far. The savoury sandwiches were uninspired and dry, and the cakes did not meet expectations. The worst experience was the tea. We had paid the extra $30 for free-flow unrestricted drinks menu and champagne cocktail. After the champagne cocktail, we waited nearly 20 minutes for our first order of tea and coffee. In fact, we had nearly finished and the staff brought us the final bill before the drinks even arrived. When they did arrive, the tea was at a tepid temperature. I would probably accept this type of service in a busy restaurant, but today certainly was not the case. I will certainly not return here for afternoon tea without a compelling offer from the restaurant.
