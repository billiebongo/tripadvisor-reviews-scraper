We used to eat here since our daughter prefers to eat Indian. The food is OK, we samples very few items, primarily dal, steamed rice and parathas. Food is average, service is prompt and prices are a little on the higher side for the value
4
Great butter chicken and naan that satisfied my craving for Indian food. Although it was a busy evening, the waiters were attentive and the food did not take too long to prepare. I would definitely return
4
Had a nice Northern Indian dinner. Starter and after that a curry with naan. Since it is outside also had a couple of beers.
5
It's one of the nicest places in Somerset area for Indian curries. I visit this place almost every Tuesday and enjoy the food and friendly conversation with the staff.

We enjoyed a family meal here whilst on the GO. This is a very good regular restaurant with food just like home. If you want good food at a good price then this is the place for you. The location is also central and surrounded by lots of other food outlets. Enjoy..
5
A great place which did not have one of the items we wanted so made it for us. Meal was brilliant, staff very attentive but not over bearing. on a street by this beautiful harbor with many restaurants most having staff who try and encourage you to stay, this place stood out, just a man standing outside, no pressure to go in, so as the scene was so nice I took the photo. Having walked around for a while passing many bars and a myriad of eating places I wanted to return and have a good curry. That is what I got a good, authentic curry with fresh ingredients and quality spices topped with delicious bread. I like this place and will return when next in Singapore
5
Dinner and the ambiance was fantastic. Highlight was when Amarjit Singh, the owner, came to our table. He is very passionate about his dishes and was so eager to pass on some of his cooking secrets in hopes of making my home cooked Indian dishes more authentic and tasty. Thank you. We will return when we next are in Singapore

This was my 3rd visit in [little over] a year, and I always brought new guests.I used to come to Maharajah about twice a month when they opened about 30 years ago. They served very good quality food back then. I always ordered their naans and dal and tandoori chicken. They never disappointed. My 1st of recent 3 visits was good; second became short of expectations(i.e. the usual "good"). My most recent visit in June went horribly wrong.The naans tasted like they had been pre-cooked & then warmed up beforeserving. They were flattened, no fluff. I suspect tandoori chicken was thawed and then deep-fried. The dal was so-so; not the tasty version I used to enjoy every visit. What happened to this place? I'd like to support small little restaurants like Maharajah, but they need to do better than this last visit. PS: most of the staff still courteou
4
I really didn't know which restaurant to select for my evening meal so this was pure luck. The staff were welcoming and although not busy, it became so during my supper. I chose the Goa Lamb curry with fruity pilau rice. A delicious duo. No complaints. Good taste, excellent portions and well served
5
Went with my wife whilst holidaying in Singapore. Our hotel was a stones throw away from Cuppage Terrace and we wanted to experience a bit of Singapore whilst not eating in our hotel. We went early evening around 6pm and were the only customers which was understandable given the time. We ordered Chicken Saag , Chicken Bhakti , Aloo Gobi , some rice and Garlic Naan. This was the best Aloo Gobi I have ever eaten. The servings were large enough to fill us up and much to our surprise the manager came out with a complimentary bowl of ice cream (as if we weren't full enough). Really good service and friendly staff and would have no hesitation in recommending this establishment. I will definitely be back when I next visit Singapor
4
This restaurant in Cuppage Road offers good Indian food.The taste was ok but service was very good. I feel they should work on improving the quality and taste.
5
Located nearby hotel and served by some great staff. Quality of food on offer is good and no complaints at all. Visited a few times and will be back
5
i visited the restaurant two nights in a row was highly impressed with the service and the quality of the food i will definelty come her again the starter was amazing and the rogan josh was the best u can get
5
We've been coming here 20 years of visits to Singapore. The owners serve you with a smile and it's a great atmosphere.
4
The food was budget friendly.Great atmosphere. Have option to dine-in indoor as well as outdoor. Thanks for good food.
4
A small Indian restaurant in the street food court at Cuppage Road. They serve indoors and outside and also takeaways. Great service with great choice of food. I loved the taste, freshness of the side dishes made and affordable cost. I had dinner twice here.
4
We had our lunch here while roaming arround at Orchard Road. Decent Indian restaurant with desi flavour. It took a bit time to locate it. Food quality was good.
5
This restaurant is well located at the centre of orchard road offering gud dining options for Indian food. The taste of food is gud with variety of veg options. Staff is very helpful and welcoming. Service was quick. Overall recommended for Indian food at Singapore ..... great ...
5
Tired of all the sea food and fried rice we had been eating since the past 10 days of our trip in Bali,we were craving some Indian food and went here. We reached at 10:40 and still they served us food! The staff is very humble and courteous and even gave my father a complimentary beer! This was the only restaurant that serves water in a glass! Butter chicken and naan had never tasted this good!! Love love love❤️ Food-⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Service-⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐
5
Our last night in Singapore and we found this gem - Tandoori cooked food that you could actually tell was, together with great service (and humour) from our front of house waiter 'Chobey' who was just great - Food was fantastic, would highly recommend this place - enjoy!!
4
Went for lunch on a Saturday. The place is right in the middle of cuppage terrace. Was not crowded. Attentive staff, delicious food, good portions. Highly recommended.
5
very nice indian food. excellent and attentive service
A little loud in the evening but nice location to sit outside
4
Went to this authentic Indian restaurant for lunch. Food was very tasty and the staff were attentive and very polite. Not the cheapest place to eat Indian but well worth it for a special lunch or dinner.
5
We were visiting Singapore on a business trip and we found out this Indian restaurant which looked not so impressive.
The surprise was great because of the outstanding delicious plates, flavor sand service.
The price was reasonable as well, 88 Singapore dollars for two.
4
My husband and I had dinner at this restaurant last night and it was delicious. The food was hot and came out in good time, good service. We will be frequenting this restaurant on our return to Singapore after our cruise. We were also served a free ice cream after dinner and given a $10 voucher. Bonus!!!!John and Gail Lane
1
I visited this restaurant yesterday with my family & friends group. The food was pathetic... without any taste... hard to remember when I ate such a terrible food last time. When we approached waiter (Chaubey) who was serving us, he was least interested in hearing us. At last when we requested him to taste what he served us, he could not argue but have to accept it was pathetic. We saw later similar complaints from other tables as well. Hence my advice will be please please don't go to this place... where along with food even customer service (Chaubey) was terrible... there are tons of better Indian restaurant in Singapore
4
It was several years since I last patronized Orchard Maharajah - instead I went to other Maharajah outlets like Boat Quay or Chip Bee Garden.Last Sunday visit with my family (6 altogether) was rather pleasant and enjoyable. Food tasted delicious like before and service was pretty good. All of us had a good meal that evening and will come back again - perhaps not with a gap of several years!!We had standard fare like pokaras, tandoori chicken, fish vindaloo, naans, pilav rice, keema mattar, bindi marsala, yellow dhal, paneer butter marsala and channa marsala. We over-ate especially after the complimentary mango ice cream. Overall bill was $36/pax inclusive drinks and ++.Miss the previously tented Level 2 hall
5
Located along with dozen other dining option on Cuppage road, 2 mins away from orchad road, this restaurant is one of the two Indian restaurant in the vicinity. Now I dont remember why we didnt choose the other one, this one was nonetheless great pick. The manager was very friendly and warm and found us table pretty quickly in crowded but open air place seating area.The food taste very good and spices were well balanced. My mom doesnt like most restaurant in India itself but found this one to be great just because the food was fresh. The extensive preparation of Indian food force many restaurants to prepare half cooked curry and potential use for more than one day but this restaurant seem to put good effort to ensure that food is fresh and has high quality ingredients

Insightsuite went to this place since a visitor who is a native Singaporean but staying overseas for several years was keen on having authentic Indian food. From Mandarin orchard hotel where he was staying, this place is 5 minutes walking distance located at 37 Cuppage road next to Cuppage plaza & holiday Inn hotel & in the evening the surrounding area was pretty crowded. It is located between several other eateries & has two sections indoor aircon & out-door covered space. Maharajah chain of restaurant has been around for around 3 decades now. Their signage sports typical dome of Mughal architecture you will come across if you visit north India. Once upon a time there were 11 outlets all over Singapore but due to severe competition in food & beverage industry they operate only three now. The other one is located at Boat Quay. We settled for mutton Rogan josh & potato based vegetable & plain naan. Followed by a sweet dish. The service was not too late & they gave us few fried lentil papadams with mint chutney to kill the time. The food was excellent as & perfectly cooked. The gulab jamun was a bit too hot though & almost burned my tongue (too much of micro-wave, I guess)
3
We love Maharaja at Boat quay so we decided to try Maharaja at Orchard too.It was hot afternoon and we went for lunch. We were greeted well and we sat inside as it was hot outside.Ambience is average. A modern Indian-Punjabi look is filled in air with handwoven chatr at the ceiling. Server was wearing Punjabi pagdi on his head giving a punjabi felling. He was courteous and quick.Whatever we ordered, the taste was below average. Probably it was our bad choice or chef's bad day. The onion pieces served with lemon and chilli were dry on the surface, indicating they were cut and stored since long.Pind chana was bland. After lot of contemplating on should I complain or not, I told the server that there was no taste in Pind chana. To this he checked and said that probably he forgot to write that it was ordered by Indian customer and chef kept mild chilli in food thinking the order was by an expat, since they get them a lot.I did not say anything. Then we ordered Jeera rice and dal tadka. This time I specifically asked him to make it spicy. It was spicy but had less salt; eventually we did not enjoy.The major disappointment though was with Mango lassi. It was hot afternoon, we wanted to quench our thirst with a lassi. Punjabis cannot go wrong with lassi. It tasted like a juice. I shared this with server. He brought the chef outside and made me explain him. I shared my experience to which the chef promised to take my order personally, the next time we visit.Generally, I am reluctant to complain on food as sometimes it is taken otherwise. But this time I shed my inhibition as I wanted to convey that customers are also not fools. You cant serve anything and get away with that. So after sharing my thoughts, I told server, please charge me for the whole food as I have consumed it. I am not looking for any freebies. To which he smiled and started sharing some old incident. I smiled and told him that was the precise reason why asked for full bill upfront; so that I am not misunderstood.Apart from the taste, we found it was high on price. It may also be because we did not have good time. 70 SGD for two is pricey! Not sure if we will come back, but if we do, I will try it with a fresh mind
4
Resturan has very nice and kind staff. They do hospitality with some extra than your order for free like ice cream and indian chips. Food are fresh and enough nice .
4
We were in a rush but my friend had wanted to eat Indian food. Turned out that I like their raisin and garlic naan! Butter chicken is nice and not spicy. Service is friendly too.
Will come back again!
1
Quite disappointed with the quality of food with exuberantly high prices. There was no discount of 20% as per one of the reviews.
Will not go there again.
2
Food was OK, comparable to many indian dishes i've had. Nothing exceptional, except the price. Well this is Orchard Rd, right?
3
The place has good ambience and staff is polite and waiting on command.. but i was disappointed a bit with the authenticity of India taste in Vegetarian dishes..
5
The food was really good here although the waiter said its single portion, 4 of us ate one single portion so it's always better to order less and add more if needed. The quality and taste both are authentic desi which was good and roti's / naan were soft. They gave us a S$10 voucher for our next visit but unfortunately it was our last day in Singapore
4
We had dinner here last night its at the cuttage terrace The ambience is lovely food is great and tastes like authentic dishesI was too full for dessert would loved to have tried some ,maybe next time Loved the toilet sign of indian clad male female on doors The staff were lovely great service
5
Went to there twice with my family. We had ordered 'Chaas' , lamb and ladyfingers( bhindi). Food was amazing and service was great too. They gave us 10$ discount voucher to be used in next visit. Staff was very friendly and was cheap as compared to the place and other similar options. I would definitely recommend this place 
4
My brother was visiting from India and this was the nearest Indian restaurant we found. The food was good but there is room for improvement. The lamb sheek kebabs were really good and I would recommend them to others. The chicken in the main course dishes that we had could have been more tender. The nans and khulchas were tasty
5
Craving for Indian Food when in Singapore, this is the place to go. Authentic Indian Food, great service and good ambience. They have an indoor seating which is air conditioned and an outdoor seating that is in the open. The first time we went the restaurant was past closing time but they still accommodated us and served us, The experience was excellent that we ended up visiting the restaurant on 4 occasion
4
The restaurant is one of the more simple restaurants along Cuppage Road and is a quiet place for a good, simple, Punjabi food.
Staff were friendly and the food was tasty.
Price was reasonable for central Singapore.
4
the food is very good in quality and taste and very close by to holiday inn orchard city centre. but the food is slightly on the costlier side
3
You get nice Punjabi food with a variety of dishes. You also get 20% discount on food bill over 50 SGD amount. Those who stay Orchard can walk though to reach restaurant.
5
nice place , centrally located in upmarket area, food is fresh and authentic, personal touch by place owner, chilled beer added attraction,
4
Good service, quick and really nice food. They also do Makni Dal which is not often on an Indian Restaurant mmenu
4
Great Indian food, I especially enjoyed the dhansak.
Friendly staff but I found the service a little slow
5
Really good food at reasonable prices will return soon. Butter chichen was very good along with everything else .
3
There are two realities. One, while traveling abroad, you do want a periodic dose of Indian food. Two, coming from New Delhi, you hold Indian restaurants elsewhere to very exacting standards while evaluating or reviewing them. If I rated Indian restaurants as leniently/harshly as other kinds, I'd have rated Orchard Maharajah 4 stars. But, for the reasons mentioned, it unfortunately gets 3 stars. We ordered the Malai Kofta & Jeera Aloo, both of which were not bad. The tandoori rotis, however- my real benchmark while evaluating Indian restaurants- fell short
1
I visited this restaurant with my family today. Service was horrible. Food was normal, i asked to speak to Chef to know about ingredients of an food item and was told that its not possible. I will not recommend it to anyone. Definitely not worth visiting again
5
Delicious food and great service! For Indian food in Sgp, couldn't find a better place. Excellent quality of ingredients shows up in the taste, service by Jaspal made the experience even better. They have a great Indian style tea which is not on the menu however they make it available if asked, highly recommended!Would love to revisit, thanks folks
5
Had a really nice Dinner. Service was very friendly. Food was excellent and fairly priced. I had the Tandoori Prawn with Nan, wonderful.
4
The staff are very friendly and efficient the nann bread was very good the food we had was tastie we had byo wine corkage was $15.00 the atmosphere is great really enjoyed our experience
4
Tandori chicken was not tender. Saag paneer ( vegeterian dish with spinach was good and the garlic naan as well. Price is reasonable.
4
The food's fine -- not to write home about -- but the service and outdoor setting make Maharajah worth a visit. Servers are amiable and helpful. The crowd is convivial.
A nice experience all around.
4
We were pleasantly surprised after trying out Maharajah at Orchard- we ordered Samosas followed Chole, Rotis, Dal and Jeera Rice and taste was quite good for all of them. Portion size was also good for two. Overall a good experience and would like to go back there some day
4
As others have said (which is why I chose it), The Orchard Maharajah has great food, reasonable prices and good service. Somehow after studiously examining the menu I always choose the same at Indian restaurants. I was not disappointed here. The Tandoori chicken, pilau rice, cucumber raita and garlic naan were very good, the onion bhaji was less so
4
Maharajah is a great place to go for Indian food. Always smiling and ready to serve customers. We have by now been through 40% of the items on he menu. There is a wide selection of starters and nice curries (chicken, lamb and seafood) Never have we been disappointed. It always has a great taste and the portions are just right. No one leaves the table hungry. You can always ask for their recommendations on what to eat and you might get suggestions that are not even on the card. Don't let that scare you. You can also always order more or less spicy depending on preferrence. The restaurant is located in Cuppage just off Orchard Road and they have both in and "outdoor" seating. The outdoor seating is under a huge roof - so rain will not bother you. Kids are always welcome, but it is not a kids dominated venue with kids running around screaming. Thanks for that!Prices are fair. You can also order your food as take away. We have done so a few times. Same good quality
5
When in Singapore this Restaurant is a must for all my family'Outside setting' is very good, always a very warm welcome, and the service is second to none -the staff have always got time to have a quick chatPrices are very reasonableThe food is excellent -I normally have the Chicken vindaloo (spicy so be warned)Other dishes we have tried and never had any complaintWe visited 3 times in the first 12 days of February 2016 and looking forward to our next visit to Singapore so I can have another good Indian Mea
4
We tried here a couple of times and liked the food. Orchard Maharaja serves very good and authentic Indian food and highly recommended to try. The food is very good, decent and courteous staff, good service overall. Two doors away there is another Indian restaurant called "Indian Curry House" which was a big disappointment, so I was glad I could find this. Highly recommended. Huzay
5
We stayed at the Elizabeth mount pleasant so we desperately trying to find a curry house. This restaurant was a 5 min walk away.I was pleasantly surprised with how delicious the food was. Good variety and the service was excellent.The restaurant was very busy but staff were very attentive.From a curry lover this restaurant offers a great choice with tasty food at reasonable prices
4
Food consider not that bad in Singapore as an Indian cuisine. This Indian restaurant located at Cuppage Terrace and easy to find. But Cuppage Terrace have 2 Indian restaurants, Maharajah and 1 more (sorry! Can't remember the name) just few doors away only.
2
We went there for dinner with my 2 year old son. The staff was extremely rude. Food was ok nothing great. It wasn't value for money.Guess they only entertain there regular clientele and not tourists!!!
4
A good meal of authentic flavours cooked medium spiced as requested. Most impressed by the careful packaging of the elements into useful containers for re heating. Got two meals for the price of one using my microwave at Somerset apartments three
Minutes walk away.
3
They serve decent Indian food, rush hours could be difficult to custom order, but the staff is sweet and service is good.
5
We went to this restaurant to get some North Indian food and we loved it. We ordered some daal, masala chicken, garlic naan and palak paneer and it was delicious. Since we were only a party of two, the manager agreed to give us half servings of each dish (and half the price), so we could try more different dishes. It was great. At the end, the manager was so nice with us that he even gave us a discount voucher for our next visit! We look forward to going again soo
5
I have to confess I live locally only 10 mins from Cuppage Terrace and visit regularly - but only because it is so good. There is another Indian restaurant 4 doors down the street and I have yet to visit it as the team at Maharaja are so good. They will adapt dishes for you and are always ready to greet you with a smile, laugh and a joke. You can eat inside with aircon or outside. Cuppage Terrace has also got 2 or 3 great bars and Wine Connection next door is great for decent wine at reasonable prices. We also recommend Emerald Hill (next to the Tourist Information office, opposite Somerset MRT) 5 mins away for some good bars and lovely traditional shophouse
3
Set in the Cuppage Road food area, Maharajah was good but not great. The service was pleasant and timely on an evening that appeared somewhat busy in the restaurant (12 of their 20 inside seats were occupied). I ordered a chicken tikka dish and Aloo Gobi. I received a small basket of broken up papads as I waited, which were fine. The Tikka arrived and was ok, but it was very, very mildly spiced and likely the least amount of tikka & marinate that I have had on something that was cooked in a tandoori oven. I like the coating well spiced (not hot, but it needs to be flavorful), and this offering was off the mark. It was also on the dry side.In contrast, the Aloo Gobi was pretty good to my pallet. Good sized serving that had a little heat, with chilli and ginger accents, but nice potato/cauliflower and tomato mix.Staff were attentive, dinner was medium price (S$35) and I received an unsolicited complimentary ice cream scoop if you wanted it.Would have been good if the chicken could have helped them out
5
Had a fantastic dinner experience with a couple of friends at this superb restaurant. The food was awesome especially the lamb shanks and we were spoiled for a wide selection of yummy Indian food! The service was impeccable and fast and nothing was too difficult for the waiters. Very impressive overall and is definitely a five star experience
5
We thought we would give this restaurant a go without any preconceived ideas. Turned out to be an excelllant choice. Service was excellant and while we were discussing the menu, the waiter suggested a dish not on the menu. It sounded interesting so I thought I'd try it. Very very good. Full of flavour and could not fault anything. My wife had her favourite and was also very impressed. We will be going back here again for sure. Chicken Chatpata was the name of the dish
5
We ate twice here whilst in Singapore. Situated in Cuppage Terrace it is easy to find and seating is outside under cover. The staff are very attentive and we spoke with the manager as well both times. If you like Indian food you will not go far wrong here with a very comprehensive menu to suit all tastes and good sized portions as well. Worth a visit in the evening as close to Orchard Road (back of Centre Point). Easy to get a taxi from there
4
I'd rate the food about a 3.5 and the service a 5. The service was second to none. The staff were all incredibly friendly, they were fantastic.
3
Food was normal nothing special. Location is good. Staff was friendly and 10% discount was given for reservation.
5
Been here a few times, very friendly and good food. Must try, prices reasonable and good lacation right in orchard area. Will go back again soon. Keep up the good work.
5
Great Indian food, very authentic and okayish on the price range. The staff is cheerful and the place is also nice.
4
Very good & tasty indian food in singapore. One of the best food in orchad. It is also located in most happening place of that vicinity.
3
Nice location, as covered but in the open air. Almost did not dine there due to pushy guy standing by the menu, suggesting the chicken tikka marsala for god's sake. The perils of being white. Food was done well: excellent eggplant and good fish. A little pricey but beer is good value. Not easy to get a balanced meal for one though, would prefer smaller portions for less money, or perhaps a thali option?
5
Took my visiting vegetarian friends here. Saver option considering my friend loves his food very spicey. My disappointing experience at the nearby Indian restaurant regarding spiciness level of foods which was sure to upset my friend as it did for me. So I chose to take him and his family with children to my trusted Maharajah. Since my friends loved the food here at maharajah I do not have much more to say. We visited here twice in that week and both times satisfied. Thanks to the staff of Maharajah.
2
Definitely not worth a visit ! Only if you are in the area and starving like I was will it worth to fill ure stomach .. Chicken was hard so inedible .. The dal Makhani Bombay aloo and paneer was just about average .. No flavour .. And who eats food in quarter plates anyway !? They don't even have dinner sized plates to serve their guests .. Sadly disappointed and wouldn't recommend !
5
Three of us dined at this restaurant.An experienced and friendly elder waiter greeted us warmly and welcomed us all in. Studied our preference of foods and served me chilled and lovely Jeera/Cumin water to refreshen n cool the intense heat! The men were sipping into their beers. The rotis and curries and appetizers simply melted in our mouths. Truly commendable and wish to patronize this place soon. Congrats to the team of this restaurant
3
Its a good place to get decent Indian food at a reasonable price. Food needs adjustment with spices, we possibly felt so as we were with young children and spice levels were quite low. Nice staff, simple and courteousIf you are looking for a little stylish dine, go to curry culture or tandoor next door
3
The location is fine, central in Orchard area. The food served is of average quality and less in quantity. It's overpriced also.
4
I went for a late lunch and ordered Kerala fish curry. This was spicy and good. The prices are good and the place is located in the side street of orchard. If you like Indian food this is good.
5
Personnel is very friendly and creates a nice atmosphere. Has become a place where we regular stay with friends and colleagues.
5
Went there for lunch. Excellent service. Waiter was polite and helpful. Food was nice. Kids enjoyed the butter chicken. Non of the food was greasy. Will definitely go again when in Singapore.
5
DH and I stopped by for lunch while shopping at Orchard. We were pretty much the only ones there at the beginning so we had the wait staff to ourselves. I explained to the very accommodating maitre d' what I liked about indian food - spice but not too spicy, and how I loved paneer. He said he'd have the kitchen make something special. It was probably something straight off the menu, but all I know was, he delivered! I also enjoyed the naan. And there were papadams they put on the table with mango chutney. They were so crisp and light! And the chutney was sweet, but spicy with a nice balance and fantastic texture - chunks of mango that yielded to the tooth perfectly. That made for the perfect dessert. I raved so much they gave me a $10 certificate for my next visit. I have no idea whether any of this is 'authentic'. I don't really care. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'll be back. 'Nuff said.
5
Having read so many positive reviews I was glad to visit this Indian. We were warmly welcomed by a team of jolly people who instantly got our sense of humour and made the night brilliant fun. Food was served in good time and was full of flavour. The menu was varied and had something to suit everyone. Pricing perfectly matched the whole experience. Will definitely revisit.
1
We were looking forward to trying this place, being in business in the same place since 1986, and given the positive tripadvisor rating, however couldn't even eat because of the lack of cleanliness.... Overall the restaurant appears unkempt, but the worst was the chef not washing his hands after using the restroom. Unless you consider a 1 second rinse with water and no soap "washing". For someone cooking your food, higher standards must apply. Better bet, spend a few bucks and hit up Curry Culture a few doors down
4
Just tucked behind the Holiday Inn Hotel at Orchard City Center, along the food courts, you are likely to miss it in the busy food joints in the place. The place gets quite crowded and noisy late in the evenings. The food is great, good in taste and there is quite a vairety for the Indian food lover. The service is prompt and courteous. A great place to wind off
5
best indian i've ever tried. I'm returning since 6 years to this restaurant and the quality has not changed. Service is outstanding and the staff super friendly.I can definetly recommend this place and so i have already recommended it to many friends which visited Singapore
5
We ended up eating here after walking by and seeing the great reviews. The food was good and priced well. Alcohol was not too expensive and the wine list was sufficient. The service staff were also friendly and had no problems talking to us about Singapore and what we should see in the week that we are here! Maybe needing some renovations but otherwise a pleasant experience
4
The Lamb Vindaloo was just the ticket, after a week without spicy food I was having a mini-withdrawl. Food was good quality Indian tucker and the staff were quite amusing.
5
As always; great service and great food! Visited again tonight. We had the Lamb korma (husband and girl favourite), Chicken Tikka and Chicken Tandoori. Garlic and Cheese nan. Yummy!
We will for sure be back
Reasonable priced as well.
3
Great Indian food at the best of the price the ambiance and the decor was class apart will definite come here again
4
We visited this North Indian restaurant 3-4 times during our stay in Orchard area of Singapore in Nov 2014. This is a great restaurant with authentic Indian taste with a service with a smile. The service is quick and the serving size is enough for two. At the start they serve several papads with chutney and pickles. We tried their DAL MAHARAJAH & VEGETABLE KORMA along with tandoori roti. Everything was superb. The KULFI was also very tasty and different from other restaurant. The staff is very friendly. Once in the evening it was raining very heavily, so we ordered our dinner for "home delivery" from their sister service "Dial a Curry". They delivered hdot food in about half an hour time. If you are in Orchard area, then you should not miss this restaurant
5
We first are in Cuppage Place nearly 30 years ago, and came back to see if anything remained from the old days. We found it had changed quite a bit.This restaurant offered exceptional service. We both had the Rogan Josh, and it was amazing...nothing like what you would normally be served in Australia.We arrived about 8:30pm, and there were only a few customers at the time. The meal was very well presented, and the staff attentive but unobtrusive. The premises were clean and inviting.Will definitely eat here again on our next visit
5
Good variety and prices of food considering this is Orchard Road. Food flavors have been good and portions also perfect. Considering this is singapore then the service here can be considered very good. Polite and attentive and food comes to table all together. This is priceless. Both group of friends I brought here had good experiences. The servers and manager made sure to interact with me for me to impress my guests. Clever. So far for Orchard this is my goto place for Indian restaurant food. I also like the other Indian restuarant located few doors away but have to put maharajah slightly ahead due to overall package.
4
I had the Lamb Vindaloo and it was pretty good. Mt wife had the lamb rogan josh which was also good. Nan bread and a pitcher of beer. Total was about $80. Good waiters and chef. Gave us a 10% discount for next time along with the offer of a free curry if I could finish it next time... We will return
4
When you travel with kids, you always worry about the food. So I was pleasantly surprised when my concierge at the hotel recommended Orchard Maharajah. I was met with friendly service and the manager was very helpful. He helped me choose items from the menu that would suit my family. And boy were we thrilled. The food was delicious. The taste was fantastic. I came again the next day and ordered again This time I met the owner who was just as friendly as the manager. We loved the food

As we got lured in by the convincing tripadvisor signage we were actually a bit disappointed as the food was really quite average..not particularly tasty. The service was okay and maybe even a little pushy. As we asked for recommendations half the menu got recommended to us. There was only one Wine by the Glass. The Chocolate ice cream was a nice touch when we asked for the bill... Walking away we felt we should maybe have rather walked into the curry palace next door... Next time

We first visited this restaurant in 2007 on a lay-over home from Vietnam. We were delighted then with the flavours, service and just beautiful home-style Northern Indian cooking.Since then, we have returned on almost every trip to Singapore. Yesterday we stopped by again, and one of the waiters spotted me from 30 metres away, with a broad smile, and welcome back. This is how we are greeted every single time. (Last time was two years ago.)The owner got chatting to us and told us the story. They have been there over 28 years. A guest returned after all that time, and they still remembered him!The quality and taste is amazing, and always consistent.The chefs work up to 10 months straight, but then have their airfare paid for to go home. If they work public holidays, they can rack up extra days to add to this. The owner and the business offer them loans, let them live in free housing, and the families become part of the community. Indeed, they do so well, that 80% of the business is now owned by employees.They also have another restaurant in Boat Quay. I love this one, as after tiring walking and shopping, it is in a heritage part just off Orchard Road. There is air conditioning, or outside seating. The menu has not changed, but I do not care one bit, as this is traditional Northern Indian food.They even remembered my mum was with us on our first visit!This is a gem, special, and has created its own community of financial security, fun, and family.Try the butter chicken and Naan (ask for the fluffy one!). The mint sauce with the popodoms is special (and free). Our #1 place in Singapore. See you there in about 6 months!Clare and Bil

Great North Indian food. Restorant staff is so charming and providing exceptional service. Great location on cuppage road , near to our hotel Concorde ( Orchard Road) .
5
We experienced an exceptional service, one of the best that we have seen, in Singapore. Food was great, many varieties. Must try.
4
Service, value for food was great.. enjoyed the chicken saag thoroughly and would highly recommend. Been to other places in the area and don't compete maharajah.. Thanks! !!
5
I have been to this hotel numerous times now and whenever I come to singapore, I eat here. Amazing food and superb service with very friendly staff. I highly recommend everyone to go to this restaurant.
4
Lovely food. Great location. The staff were very friendly and attentive. Would recommend this place. Covered outside seating or inside. Nicer than Maharajah at Boat Quay
5
My wife and I are on a brief visit to Singapore and we discovered Orchard Maharajah quite by chance today evening. We are staying in Holiday Inn Express on Orchard Road and were looking for a restaurant where we could have Indian food.What a wonderful discovery it turned out to be! The food was delicious,and all the dishes we ordered were prepared by the chef with great attention to detail.The manager and the waiters went out of their way to make us feel at home in this beautiful restaurant, and I rate their standard of service as excellent.We are in Singapore for one more day, and I am determined to pay another visit to Orchard Maharajah before our departure
4
I was staying at the Holiday Inn just a few yards away and noticed this Restaurant on Trip Advisor was very close by and seemed to be highly recommended. It was my last night in Singapore, so I thought I would give it a go. I was travelling alone.I ate inside where it was air conditioned. The food was excellent. Very light and tasty. The Garlic Naan was fantastic. Very thin, light, perfectly cooked and full of flavour. In the UK are Naan's are very thick indeed and almost a meal on their own.The rest of the meal was too a very high standard, as was the service. It was too pricey either. It wasn't inexpensive, but this is Orchard Road area Singapore.Definitely worth trying if you are staying in the Holiday Inn Orchard Road
4
The restaurant is situated in the main Orchard shopping area, with good seating, and great service. Food is tasty, but portions are for only enough for two people. Some non-vegetarian dishes like Prawns are a bit pricey.Overall it is a good meal, and great service. The head waiter Chobuie is a fantastic waiter with a great sense of humor
5
It was nice to discover that this restaurant was still in operation and as good as it ever was back in the late 80's and 90's. A trip down memory lane for us and the food was delicious.... nice to know that some things don't change. A most enjoyable meal and evening
2
not authentic at all, food quality was not great was obvious it was microwaved. They reached out offered 10% off I was going as someone recommended it, but honestly don't know why. Wasn't good food was old and I wouldnt recommend it. Mango Lassi costs $7 a bit ridiculous, it's not a 5 start restaurant and it was a very small cup, average at best. Bhunna goat not good, balti chicken bland, paratha not fresh, I liked outdoor seating, and I liked service, but won't go back for service, I'm looking for good food. one more place taken off my list
3
Excellent friendly and very quick service. Food portions generous . Naan very good, curries average and rather bland .
4
The food was very good, service excellent, atmosphere nice. Air conditioned inside with outdoor area. Just a little expensive but still a great meal. High quality food
4
We really enjoyed this place. It was reasonably priced, but the service was fantastic! The wait staff made us feel really special, so we had a great time. Will certainly eat here again.
4
You will NOT be disappointed at the selection of well spiced dishes here. Located on the Cuppage Terrace don't be pulled into the other places, try this one first.A very well thought out vegetarian selection; as you would expect with Indian cuisine. The Vegetable Samosa are not the small crispy parcels we know in the UK; but instead fist sized pyramids stuffed full of aromatic spices and vegetables. One is sufficient for a starter; and served with puppadums and both mango chutney and a light ratia.I had a main course of Channa Masala with Pillau rice and naan. The colours and presentation were wonderful. Washed down of course with Kingfisher lager beer.The only complaint .. the portions are so big I didn't feel like asking for the dessert menu
5
Service was fast and efficient yet the atmosphere was relaxed. Also the staff was very attentive, polite and friendly yet not intrusive. Asked the right questions in the right moments thus contributing to the experience of the very well prepared indian cusine (if i had a restaurant i would try to hire just this kind of waiter...). Also the portions were very generous. For example, free popadum was served while we were waiting (quite common) but it was replaced by a new portion as soon we had eaten it up. Also the menu contained a vast display of vegetarian alternatives
4
It is located in Orchard Road. Easily accessable through Somerset MRT station. Has both indoor and outdoor seating. Staff are very nice. Food quantity and quality is good. Food is tasty.Service is fast. It is pricey may be because of its location. They gave complimentary ice cream and a discount too
3
Tucked in the midst of several restaurants . Food was very good. Naan was fresh & good. Curry was quite tasty. We sat outdoors.... Was relaxing! Very pleasant staff. We were given a $10 "voucheque " towards our next visit ... A nice gesture!! We however didn't have time to go back there . Will most likely visit again when next I visit Singapore!
5
Ate dinner here one night and loved it. Food was good, service quick and staff very friendly. We shared an entree and had two mains with rice (very fluffy and light). The naan bread was delicious. We were offered a complimentary scoop of strawberry ice-cream for dessert which was very thoughtful. Would definitely recommend to others
3
Not the best Indian that I have eaten in. The food was ok and the service a but slow, overall a ok experience and one that I would not necessarily repeat if I was to pay for the food myself. I am sure that there are better out there
5
We had a late evening flight to catch and decided to catch some Indian Food. Got a recommendation on Maharajah, but not expecting anything special. Turned out that it is located in an area of Orchard road with 5-6 restaurants to choose from, all sharing a common covered outdoor area. The outdoor eating area is not special by Singapore standards, but very comfortable, and I would assume at peak times pretty busy.The waiter, had some great recommendations for us, as we are not Indian food experts, and they were all on target. I wanted a good seafood dish, and he suggested something that was not currently on the menu, but his favorite....and very good. Happy hour drink prices were good, and if you go before the crowds, you can probably negotiate an extra drink.Pricing good...a nice low key, good food experience
4
Nice Indian restaurant in cuppage road have good Indian food.nice people service is fast and good.they give 10 dollar discount voucher every time.
4
If you are on the lookout for some Indian food, look no more. Authentic Indian taste and not too heavy on the wallet.
3
Ambience was good. the quality of service they provided was great. Nothing great about Indian food they served
3
This restaurant's main advantage was it was within walking distance to the Holiday Inn where I stayed. Tandoori chicken was OK if a little short on chicken. Fairly fast service and reasonable prices. Outdoor seating was nice for dinner.
4
in between the city at a good location you get good indian food. Little overprices. But good at taste for both food and drinks.
4
The restaurant is just off Orchard Road near Somerset MRT Station. The food was delicious and the service was great. We were seated immediately, no booking required, and the food arrived very promptly after ordering. There's lots to choose from on the menu - we had the prawn butter marsala, lamb saag and chicken methi along with a single serve of rice and some garlic naan. All the dishes were tasty and there was plenty of food for four of us. They also gave us complimentary chocolate ice-cream after the meal (a nice touch). All in all, a nice night out with friends.
4
This restaurant is located on Cuppage road off Orchard road and can be easily missed by first timers. For reference it's about 5 mins from Paragon and Takashimaya. It's located only a few meters away from another Indian restaurant - Curry Culture.We went there for lunch and the ambience, location and service were all pleasing. The food is mainly north Indian and they had quite a few options and a variety. Overall, the food was very tasty, fresh and the quantities were satisfying as well. For 9 adults the bill was about 130-150 sing dollars. All in all, good place
4
We love the Cuppage Terrace scene. It is very Singapore. Definitely Asia but with a western influence. Mahrarajah's is our favourite restaurant on the street. The service is attentive and not over-bearing. The wait staff are willing to make suggestions and not just agree with what you order. The food is first rate. A shade on the pricey side but where isn't in Singapore? We had a great range of curries and breads. We ordered too much but we still ate it all. We will be back
5
As other reviews state , to find such a great restaurant so close to Orchard is a bonus.Not over priced whether it be the food or the wine!Although the kids had eaten before we went out ( they didn't eat here) they still got a ice cream at the end which made their night !Have been twice and we will continue go use this great eatery.Recommend to all 
5
Friendly and welcoming staff who are not overly pushy. Great flavours and really fresh tasting....sometimes you have Indian that tastes like it's been sitting in the pot for 3 days, definitely not the case here. My cottage cheese in cashew nut and fenugreek sauce was delicious, and hubby is a rogan josh connoisseur who loved his meal and his garlic naan. Great service with the waiter guiding me on which dishes were suitable for me with my food intolerances. We overheard a couple of Aussies at the next table saying they had been there a few months back and thought it was the best Indian they'd ever had. Perfect meal was capped off with complimentary ice cream and a $10 discount voucher, this will ensure we return before we leave Singapore
5
Went here with some colleagues, great food, service was excellent. Would certainly visit again. Didn't keep you hanging around, nor did you feel rushed, just right.
4
This the second time I came to this place the staff very friendly and nice food and clean place. Compeer with the anther restaurant
4
Good Indian food and nice, friendly and humourous staff. They didn't just nod and take our orders, but had suggestions on what to eat/combine without being too pushy.
5
My girlfriend and I visited this restaurant by chance, we were actually going to visit the nearby competitor Indian restaurant but changed our mind and chose this one. I must say, a great choice. The food was excellent, very well prepared and cooked with wonderful use of spices to make some really authentic and delicious flavours that are subtly different from other indian restaurants I have visited. The staff were very friendly and the head waiter who served me was truly excellent, even giving me the best tips on how to make some of the food and telling me the best ways to flavour the dishes. A very social atmosphere with staff who want to enjoy time with the customers and to talk with you too but they are not too pushy or in the way. Although the price was a little high if you go there between 3-7pm you can often enjoy a 30% discount on your total bill so that allows you to eat more which is really great. I thoroughly recommend this restaurant to any who like a real Indian curry made by real and friendly Indians who make the experience very enjoyable. As I said before, simply excellent
5
I have been there a number of times and have always been impressed by the quality of the food. Was not disappointed this time. Loved the naan and the food. Naan was soft and crispy.Friendly staff. One of the staff went out of his way to please us. Will definetly visit again and bring friends as wel
4
Came upon this place during a vain attempt to find a 24 hour sports (football) bar. Gave up in the end! Anyway, arrived very late - the next nearest curry house had already shut. I was their only customer but they weren't interested in hurrying me, I stayed an hour at least. Good curry, rice and naan. Could have been spicier I suppose, and like every other restaurant I've been to in SE Asia, the food soon went cold. Don't think the UK custom of serving on food warmers (candle burners) has caught on here. German dunkel beer was a surprise, if expensive. Very friendly staff. Worth a visit, definitely
4
The Orchard Maharajah has a sit out area as well as a small sit in air conditioned area. As it was Jan, the weather was good and we opted for sit out area for dinner.The staff are mostly Indian and they do understand the indian style of cooking and food requirements.. so with your North India dishes, you get onions, aachar and green chillies ....The food tastes good....like in any indian joint back in India....also the best part is they give a discount on the bill + if you are a regular patron they sometimes provide you with a complimentary servings of ice cream....A good place to have Indian food in indian style...
2
Hmm... disappointed with the so-called service. Not only slow...but I felt they try to bribe you with ice cream to compensate for the poor service. (Good recovery response) But from the other reviews I have read, this seems to be their way of being apologetic for the poor service. Be more pro-active & tackle the service standards & the staff. Don't wait for things to happen & then react. As for food, I was equally disappointed with the bits of papadums & the chutneys - just green chillis with no flavour. Paneer was not soft & tasted starchy. Not going again & NOT recommendin
4
Nice restaurant with authentic food from the northern Part of India, the Staffel is very friendly, the food was excellent, great variety of vegetarian dishes, excellent Curries, nice Open air terrace, the value for money is quite good, Not so much expensive as other Indian restaurants in the City, recommendable for people who like real Indian foo
4
Hi I'm from United Arab Emirates I take my lunch in this restaurant the people they are very friendly and all the time smiling and deal with customer in good way , we was 6 people as friend and the meal was nice as Indian food also the decoration is v.good and clean I advice to seat out side also it's good We pay 198$ for 6 people including the salad and starter 
5
Great Indian food with friendly staff. Atmosphere is good and I always visit when in Singapore. If it's not on the menu ask the waiter and they can normally prepare. Well worth a visit.
5
What more can I say? Tiger beer on tap, rich menu, excellent and respectful service. Have come hear for business and with family and children with equally pleasant results.
5
Service is superb, nice people very friendly the food was amazing good, they have space indoor and patio too. Really good worth a visit for sure.
5
We have eaten at many indian restaurants in Singapore and this has to be the best by far! good quality meals at reasonable prices for orchard road, Service is excellent with friendly and attentive staff.
2
Only as a last resort do you dine here! I was a little put off by the food. Too much cream, salt & oil.
Service was okay but not from the heart. Didn't seem as if they stood by their food & restaurant.
4
A must go for an indian food lover. It is a bit on an expensive side but in the end i thinks its worth it, in order to avail an authentic taste. If you have some extra money to spend do try this place.
4
Very good food. Awesome wait staff and manager. Chose restaurant on their trip advisor rating and proximity to our hotel. Well worth trying. Literally one of the best curries I have had. As we begged on the night...come to Brisbane!!!! Probably overpriced for the type of food and service. Very generous on the pappadum
4
We very much enjoyed our meal. The food was fresh and flavoursome, while not being too heavy or oily. Thick, rich sauces, tender meat, and soft breads. All very nice. No real "wow" factor but the quality was consistently good. The head staff are very friendly, happy and chatty. They were very welcoming. During the meal the staff were a bit inattentive (a little hard to get their attention) but at least weren't over-bearing. Prices a little high in my opinion, but overall a very nice meal with good service and a very nice, cool outdoor setting (there's indoor aircon dining too but I recommend sitting on the deck, which has adequate fan air circulation). A very nice colonial terrace house street setting, with an effective mix of modern and heritage.
5
I went for 4 Indian meals in 4 different restaurants and its tough to rate one over the other but this one edges ahead not only because of the food quality but also the pricing was reasonable and they gave 30% discount which means you save decent money. The restaurant was barely a foot outside our hotel Holiday Inn and Mr. Chaubey treated us like one of his own. Had a really pleasant time, unfortunately could not avail their 20% discount for dinner but there is always the next time ;
3
Had just arrived on a long-haul flight, so decided to try somewhere near my hotel. This is in a street with lots of restaurants with outdoor seating. Staff all wear 'traditional' North Indian dress, so I wonder whether this is designed more for tourists than people wanting authentic food. Service was very good, friendly etc. Poppadum came in bits of poppadum, with 2 sauces, a creamy one and mango chutney which had massive chunks of mango in it. Missing a spicy or tasty pickle to go with it. For my main I chose chilli paneer, fancying some spice. While it was tasty, it was not very spicy with what looked like green chilies tasting like green peppers. Turned down the free ice cream at the end, which came after I'd paid my bill, despite being plenty of time between clearing my main course plates and paying, but nice to be offered it anyway
5
Excellent meal, best curry we've ever had. Very friendly and welcoming staff. Would recommend eating here.
5
I went to mahrajah restaurant based on trip advisors review . I really enjoyedthe authentic indian food. Have to try it.
4
Very friendly, food was excellent and price absolutely ok. we will definitely come back... Great location for indian food.
5
This is a good restaurent if you are craving for nice north indian food. It is located in one of the most happening area of Singapore and all the dishes are fairly priced.
5
And I will visit soon again. Food was great. Service was pleasing. Not sure if I should say this. But I used a 10$ discount voucher. And after dinner they gave me another 10$ voucher. I have no reason not to visit again to enjoy the food and discount. In orchard and want some good indian food. Make your way to Maharajah. Tip: Be careful not to mistake it for the other indian restaurant nearby :)
4
We really enjoyed the food, the currys, the naans, the lassi, the rice. the food was very good, fine, spiced as we had asked. the service was superb and we really had a good time. The ratio quality/price is really one of the best we have experienced for indian food
4
The common dishes like Chicken Masala were a bit bland with nothing exciting (making it good die kids), the grilled shrimp was mushy, but some other dishes were outstanding, particularly the Bhindi masala, and the chicken mirch masala. Outdoor seating option is nice and there are dozens of restaurants next to it if you're unsure about what everyone wants to eat.
3
Hubby and I went to Orchard Maharajah over the weekend as he was missing Indian food and since we were on Orchard Road, decided to give this place a try based on Tripadvisor reviews. Unfortunately, this place does not deserve the good reviews for the terribly average food we had. We started off with Adraki Murgh, a bit more charred at the edges than what we prefer, tastewise decent enough, dal makhani, bland with an orange tinge, Lamb Tikka Masala, big mistake, it tasted like a normal gravy that I can very well make at home, no hint of the tikka masala anywhere, along with garlic and plain naans. Dishes were in the range of 18 - 20 bucks, atleast for the stuff we ordered and for the portion and quality of food, I found it a rip off. The saving grace was the kulfi that we ordered and that's it. We don't plan to return to this one
4
We found the restaurant through tripadvisor and because of the many positive ratings we expected a lot more guests. Other than two others were the only people there which made us wander if we were at the right place. The waiter was very kind and nice though and we had very delicious and quality-wise excellent Indian food! The location isn't the best, in between many other restaurant under what seemed to be a market hall roof but you can't expect much better considering the cheap prices for that good food
5
We enjoyed about the best Indian food possible at this restaurant. We ate outside in a covered extension of the restaurant and it was very pleasant. The local pedestrian shopping restaurant arcade was fun and entertaining in a quiet way. The menu had many delicious options and the food we ordered was delicious. Tandoori chicken was extremely tender, moderately spicy and hot when served. The butter chicken was mild and the sauce perfect. The lamb tikka masala was spicy but not hot spicy. The sauce again was great. The service was prompt and friendly. Free mango ice cream at the end was a nice touch. I would go again in heartbeat. 66 Sing for 2
5
I didn't know I particularly enjoyed Indian food until I tried the dishes at Maharajah. And then no other Indian restaurant has offered anything comparable till now. This is how North Indian food is supposed to taste like - fit for a king!
5
Had a great meal at Maharajah Orchard.
Particularly the Garlic Naan , Butter Chicken and Tandoori Prawns.
Around the corner from Centrepoint in Orchard Road and definitely worth a visit
3
Food was tasty and service was very pleasant. Nothing made it stand out from the crowd, but if you needed somewhere close to Orchard Road to eat then it would be a safe option.
5
I have been going to Singapore every three months for the past several years. Maharajah has two restaurants - one on Orchard and one at Boat Quay. Both have outstanding food and service. I am partial to the one on Orchard as the staff now recognize me and are always incredibly welcoming. Now, I am moving to Singapore and will be able to walk here. Can't wait to bring my family..
5
Visited the Maharajah with friends that live in Singapore, as they said it has the best Indian food in town and they weren't wrong. Every dish was melt in your mouth quality and ampul quantity. The service is of an equal level and you are made welcome from the moment you walk in to the moment you leave. Will definitely be returning next time I'm in Singapore
5
This place has amazing Indian food. I highly recommend the butter chicken and the buttered naan. The Dahl makhani is good too. There was complimentary ice cream on your flavor and it was a nice end to a great meal. The service was top notch and we even got a $10 coupon for next time we go there. We will for sure be back and I highly recommend this place.
3
The restaurant is well located in the heart of city near to all great shopping destinations. After a long day at shopping, we were looking for a nice relaxing place with some good meal options. And there it was. The ambience is average, with good outdoor seating in a lively environment. The food menu offers limited options if you are vegetarian. For non-vegetarian options, they have good varieties in chicken dishes. We ordered a Kadai chicken, which is a popular indian recipe you can find in any north-indian restaurant and is a safer option, if you aren't in a mood to experiment with taste. This however, the order didn't really work well for us. The chicken wasn't well cooked and was too dry and chewy. Other dishes were just good enough to finish and close the meal. In all, it was an average meal, you wouldn't expect to have at such a locatio
5
I was visiting Singapore and a friend recommended that we try the food at Orchard Maharajah - just a short walk off the touristy trail of Orchard Road. We found out that the restaurant had been open since 1987 and the taste of the dishes we tried showed great effort had gone into their preparation.We had the butter chicken, rogan josh and garlic naan. The dishes were very tasty - chicken was surprisingly moist on the inside and the lamb was tender. We were taken care of by Chobae who was always at hand to warn us about the spiciness of the dishes we had ordered. There was also an extensive wine list but we preferred to have beer on this occasion.I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for great North Indian meal. There are lots of bars just around to finish off the night as well
5
I have been going to this resturant since its conception in the early 80's at the Cuppage Centre and have brought many friends to dine there. My wife & I continue to eat there on a regular basis at least once a month. Would recommend this to anyone who visits Singapore, the staff are always ready to please and provide great service that goes a long with the great food that is served.I feel that it is time that I wrote an official comment about the Maharajah. signed Ernest
5
We were recommended to go visit by a couple who had gone 2 of the 5 nights of their visit to Singapore. We were so glad we did go as the visit did not disappoint. Food and service were excellent, the price was reasonable, all waiting staff were really nice and attentive, but we need to give a special mention to Chaubrey for his outstanding service. We were also give a pleasant surprise at the end of the meal - complimentary ice cream and 10% off the bill, although not sure why.Definitely worth a visit if you are visiting Singapore - we will definitely return on our next visit
5
Excellent food - willing to modify the menu if needed (mild chilli for my guest pls) , welcoming service perhaps pleasantly cheeky at times.
4
Good food, attentive service, nice atmosphere. One of the best Indian restaurants in town.We have been regulars for years.
3
We went there on 30 th dec a family of 4 with an infant based on reviews.was a big disappointment as food was not up to the mark, tasteless with slow service. Will not go again..

If you are looking for a good North Indian restaurant ( Kashmiri & Mughlai )which is not on the high end and yet not a Food Court type but a place that you will feel comfortable to bring guests to; this is the place ! Furthermore it is located on the Cuppage TCE on the very historical Mr Cuppage's old driveway during Raffles ! Like several other restaurants here - it gives you the option to sit 'outside' or inside with the aircond. room. We chose to sit inside with interesting carpets on the ceiling. There are plenty of choice such as Tandoori Chicken half of 4 pcs $ 18.90, Chicken Tikka $ 17.90. Fish dishes around $20 which can be catered to your preference. If you or your guests are vegetarian, there are enough good choices of Vegetarian dishes. We found the dishes are satisfyingly tasty except our appetiser, vegetable Pakora. Service was wonderfully friendly- particularly Mr Shetty who assisted us with our choices. There was a surprise complimentray ice cream dessert.We understand that they have another restaurant at Boat Quay and Dial-a-Curry service
5
My wife and I had a late lunch at Orchard Maharajah before shopping at the Centrepoint. We ate inside in the air conditioned part of the restaurant because it was hot on the terrace in the middle of the day. We shared rogan josh and two cheese naan. The rogan josh was very good with every piece of lamb tender and juicy. The taste was excellent. They provided free papardam and mint and mango chutney. Service was prompt and friendly without being obtrusive. When we received the bill, we were surprised to learn that they provided a 30% discount for lunch, which brought the price down considerably. They also offered a discount coupon that we could use within the next two months. They explained that they have different promotions from time to time, so we are not sure how long this lunch time promotion will last. Orchard Maharaja seems determined to ensure both customer satisfaction and a very good lunch value in one of the most popular shopping locations on Orchard Road
5
Such good food. When we asked if they did any discounts they simply said they only offered high quality food and drinks....and they were correct. We had a great meal overlooking the river, and the next night, when walking past again, we couldn't resist but head back and enjoy another great meal. Such good food and very good service. I cant wait to come to singapore again to go for a curry
5
Met with smiling faces and a friendly hello, my partner and I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. The food was quick to be served and very tasty. The highlight for us was the friendly nature of the staff who made sure we were happy with our food and made us feel welcome and at home. Definitely worth a trip
5
we are regular visitor to this restaurant since last 4-5 year now, and must say their food quality and service is still the same.we visited this restaurant in Feb 2013, for late lunch, as it was already 3.30 PM and there is no other Nice Vegetarian Option available around Orchard Area, we visited this place, and pleasantly surprise to see it was open for lunch and there are few other guests also eating.we have ordered, Veg Jalfrazi, Malai Kofta and Cheese Nan, Roomali Roti, Gulab Jamum (For the Kid), and it was served hot in <15 mins, amazing :)And the food quality was authentic, and service was superb!Also, they were having some promotion and offered us 30% discount (upto 6pm)I would definately recommend this place to anyone looking for nice Indian food near Orchard Area..
4
We came across the Orchard Maharajah restaurant (37 Cuppage Road, Singapore) by accident whilst out for a walk. Hidden amongst other restaurants (all busy), we were attracted to the Maharajah because of the friendliness of their staff, especially "Chubby" (manager/waiter). The food was really good and the chef was happy to tweak one of his dishes to suit our young daughter's taste. At the end of the meal Miss Seven declared "the food is so good I want to eat here every night!" Our schedule didn't allow it, but we would have returned for another round of great curries and accompaniments if possible. Definitely on our list for a return visit when next in Singapore.Yes, the price was on the upper side of average, but overall pretty normal by Singapore standards
5
Just returned from an excellent evening at Maharajah. Despite a lover's tiff at the next table resulting in smashed glasses and temper-tantrums, everything remained calm and wonderful, and succulent Northern Indian food was served with a smile and a sense of humor. The evening was topped off with free deserts and a cheeky beer. Thanks is much
5

The food is here is absolutely delicious. Apart from this, the staff, ambiance and atmosphere within this restaurant creates a very comfortable and relaxed environment. Do give it a try when and if you are in Singapore, you won't regret.

This is so ideal an informal inexpensive Indian dinner at Singapore, yet very taste and with lots of dishes to choose from. The variety of curries is great, suiting all tastes, non spicy all the way to very hot spicy, or even a-la-carte spicy if you chat with the waiter.The outside area is nice, with ceiling fans alleviating you from experiencing the heat of Singapore while taking an air-con break at the same time.We ordered also some Indian ice cream to finish the meal, turning out to be light and refreshing. A nice surprise for under 40 sing dollars each

We had dinner there last night and really liked it.It was in an old section off Orchard Road in a little outdoor "restaurant row" type atmosphere. The service was outstanding, and it was some of the best Indian we have ever had. It's a bit pricey, but so is everything in that location

We went to this restaurant on the basis of other Tripadvisor recommendations. If anything our expectations were exceeded. We were early on a Friday evening so the place was empty and we got a great table by the water. The service was polite, attentive and very pleasant. The food - starting with the complimentary popadum basket and dips - was plentiful and very tasty. We had vegetable samosas and pakoras for starters followed by butter chicken, dal and channa masala with a side of nan bread and pilau rice. All were excellent and despite our best efforts too much to get through. On asking for the bill we were presented with complimentary strawberry ice cream. A very nice finishing touch. Overall, a wonderful restaurant in a great location

Take into account that service in Singapore is already high, this place tops it up with warm and hospitable service.My wife was keen to go for some Indian food and this place was close by. When we arrived the restaurant was totally empty whikst the restaurants surrounding it where well visited. We doubted for a bit but still went ahead and took a small outside table.The restaurant filled up in the course of our dinner, with many locals or at least with many handshakes and smiles when new patrons arrived.The complimentary popadums where a nice surprice. The food tasted good, was in good portions. The naan could have been a bot more tastier but good all in all.When we asked for the bill we got a complimentry scoop of vanilla ice cream and a 10SGD voucher for a next visit

One of favorite restaurants in Singapore. So much so it is the only one I recommend to friends. I like Boat Quay due to the location on the river. Only thing I did not like on the last visit was the English couple sitting next to us, complaining about the price of the food etc. Anyone who has been to would know that to compare with the food that they get is silly. Mind they did not leave any & were then raving how good it was

The one thing that stood out the first time I ate at Maharajah, was that unlike all the pushy staff at the other restaurants along Boat Quay trying to get you into their restaurants, the staff at Maharajah didn't try to harass people walking down the pavement. I asked the manager and he said with a smile 'That's because I know the quality of my food'. He was VERY right!The quality of the food is outstanding and so is the service. From the samosas and malai kebab to the prawn korma and chicken saag. Every dish was delicious along with outstanding naan.The atmosphere of the restaurant is warm and inviting. If you want great service, good food and a great atmosphere whilst having dinner by the river I highly recommend Maharajah

My wife and I, along with our toddler were looking for a nothern indian curry last friday night. From the UK, we have spent a few months in Singapore now. We are used to our Thursday curry, and now in Singapore I can say it is not that simple to find a good north indian curry.So we tried this place, as it was close to where we stay. The place was 2/3 restaurants after a first north indian curry house (Kinara) which was completely empty. When we arrived to Maharajah, it was actually crowed, no space available inside. So we sat outside (not always a good idea to seat outside, when it is hot and you are going to eat spicy food) and ordered our favorite: lamb saag. We also ordered sweet naan and pilau rice. 1 Curry comes at ~20SGD, rice ~8SGD, naan ~5SGD once you have added 10% service and 7%GST.Looking at the food, lamb saag was runny, lacking of flavor, feeling only onion, chili, spinach. Lamb was tender but had a few pieces rather tough. The rice was very disapointing with a strong flavour of clove, lots of cadamon pods, cooked too long, not fragrant at all. The naan was a joke, small with dried fruit bits in it, very thick, not pleasant.The only good surprise was the size of a glass of beer, the free little papadoms, and the free ice creams. The staff also gave us a 10SGD voucher (on min spending 50SGD).To make it short, we have been really disappointing on everything we ordered, but most important the pricing is a real joke. We did enjoy better our curry at Vintage India or Khansama for same or less money. Will not come back
