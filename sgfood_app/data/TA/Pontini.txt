Poor management result in inconsistency in quality of food. Service staff were friendly but Hotel Manager is a rude fella....unknowledgeable and authoritarian!

A classy restaurant with very good service. The service crews gave maximum attention while serving us. Make us feel very comfortable. Place is clean and quiet. Good place for anniversary celebration.
The food is pricey. The quality of food is excellence.
Strongly recommended.

It was my boyfriend's birthday and thought of celebraring it at this restaurant since we love Italian food. A must be memorable experience turned out to be a complete upside down to us. Unappealing Ambience. Unattentive and very SLOW service. Poor quality of main course. Low value of money!Our bad experience started with a phone call. I called to inform dem that I have to move my reservation later of 1 hour and surprisingly the reception replied "Why?". Am i really supposed to give a reason for that???Anyways moving on.. as we enter the restaurant, there were no one to welcome us until we reach d dining area which was way too far from d entrance. Thanks to d chef who help us signal to dem that Hey we got a customer here. Reception didnt ask wether we have any reservation and how many of us. But good thing she gave us a window seat which was my request so perhaps she assumed it was us who made d reservation. The layout was nice but abit awkward for the ambience as there was a part of the place that was completely dark as lights were off.We order the 3-course meal but the fish we want not available so gave us alternative option. I want the entree but its just for 4 course so ok fine. Starters was nice served very quick. Squash soup was ok different from the usual. And until we reach the main course which made our night starts to become a disaster. My boyfriend had a short ribs. At first half it was still acceptable that fats are like 1/3 of the meat. But then the other half was 2/3 FATS and even more!!! This is a fine dining where main course are served in small portion of meat and you will provide us with a 3/4 fats in it! This is so unacceptable as we are not paying that cheap for this meal! Anyways we asked from the manager(i suppose) den she checked with the chef and as per dem it was really supposed to be like that. We do not want to cause any much trouble but seems like they didn't take this thing too seriously.And so having our mood very much spoiled we are now only waiting for the dessert.. And guess what, it took almost another 20-25 minutes to wait for it to come!! Imagine how much patience we used for this! I almost want to walk out and cry of shame for him but I just forced to control my mood and change the atmosphere as I dont want to ruin my boyfriends bday. But luckily, in fairness finally i can say atleast the dessert was very nice. Give abit sweetness in our minds.And then here it goes again made us wait for so long for our bills. In total, we stay there for almost 2 hours and more than hour of it was wasted for the waiting time. And to the fact, the restaurant wasn't even busy at all!Anyways I have to say that this was really such a disappointing experience in this restaurant and its a BIG NO NO for a come back here! I have heard dey are renovating this restaurant. Well hopefully dey would also consider reconstructing the food quality and service standards

This is my favourite place for Italian food in Singapore. Great menu range, excellent ambience and lovely food. The tiramisu is to die for. Brought my wife there for our anniversary and also went there for a couple of other special occasions. Will go a lot more often if the price is lower.
4
Note, the restaurant is very fussy about flip flops and shorts so make sure you're smart casual or they'll turn you away.Saying that, it's always a pleasure to eat here and their pizzas are thin and crispy with a good selection of toppings. Good a la carte choic

Having won a buffet for 2 at Pontini, I read up on it and found out that it was a semi buffet. The buffet is only on Saturdays from 12-3pm. I was disappointed upon entry to Pontini as the podium where the waiter/waitress was to be to greet the guest, was not there. We waited for 5 mins before we decided to just walk in. As we walked in, the chefs who saw us coming had signalled to the floor staff of our arrival. We were then greeted and asked if we made a reservation.After we were shown to our seats, the manager/supervisor who attended to us briefed us on the menu and explained where the antipasti, and desserts are as well as the cheese room that they have.I enjoyed the mushrooms and the truffle egg from the antipasti selections best. There was the Foie Gras Station as well. I enjoy foie gras very much but i found that the brioche was too dry inspite there was no heating lamp to warm the foie gras that was left for the guest to take while the chef is not at the station. The second time I wanted t indulge in this, the foie gras was too cold and I didn't enjoy my second plate of it. Maybe perhaps a heating lamp should be used to have it warm.Pizza that we ordered and shared was wonderful. Reminded me of Paris, when I had an almost similar pizza. The Spinach Ravioli with cheese wasn't so much to my liking. Maybe its because of that slight taste of Bleu in it. Portions though is sufficient for me. After this, my husband and I ordered the NZ Lamb Rack and I didn't regret on my decision for having this. It is the most tender Lamb Rack that I have tasted. I ordered a Medium Doneness. My husband ordered it with a Well Done doness and still it was tender. I was the most loveliest taste to my palate. The presentation of the lamb rack was simple. I think a little bit more of the puree should be on the plate.After having that most exquisite and tender lamb, we moved to the dessert selection. The best dessert on the buffet to me was the Ricotta Grono Cheese tart and the fruit tart. It wasn't so sweet but tantalizes the taste buds. It wasn't heavy but very light on the palate. If I wasn't too full from the lamb, I might have gone for the second serving of these 2. Well done to the chefs

My colleagues and I took a light evening meal here, four of us. We each had a different pasta entree, well presented and very delicious. The service was good, attentive and helpful, roughly 100SGD per person so middle of the road for prices. A nice spot for a grown up experience or for a quiet couples meal, would recommend and I hope to visit again
3
Attended dinner on a Saturday night was 90% full seems to be short handed. My wine glass was left empty a few times service was not promt but staffs were friendly and approachable.

Good food but wouldnt say value for money. They are strict about dressing and my husband was not allowed in knee length shorts. he had to go to the room and change into jeans.

This is a pretty good Italian restaurant but price is above med range so be prepared to pay a bit more but still worth.

We used to visit this restaurant at least once a month over ten years ago. After a bad experience we did not return until tonight only because we had a coupon. The vast extent of the menu and the almost empty venue should have warned us not to try fresh seafood. I had an octopus and asparagus started. The octopus was so tough it was like chewing rubber. The asparagus was like eating straw. My partner ask for Tuna medium rare. The fillet served to him was so think there was no way that it was not cooked through. I will not be returning to this establishment even with a coupon. Such a disappointment from our fond memories of the past.

I was at Pontini about 12 years ago for my 12th wedding anniversary. 12 years later, I re-visited it. What a fantastic and pleasant experience after such a hiatus.Reservation was easy, just a phone call. The servicing staff were very professional and attentive. The restaurant manager is very knowledgeable with the menu and has a very good palate for wine too. During the dinner, the very friendly Italian chef came around for a chat and also explained and recommended some dishes.As its a family affair, we ordered dishes for sharing. The linguine was outstanding. The lobster was really fresh and well cooked. The Florentine beef was one of the best I've tried. Even the variety and quality of dessert was fantastic. Pontini now has a combination of a great Italian chef, a fantastic French dessert chef and a wonderful team of service staff and manager. Keep it up, I will surely return very soon, not another 12 more years

We ate here whilst staying at the Grand Copthorne. The standards of service, the décor and the menus are extraordinarily good. My seared tuna was cooked to perfection and was perhaps the finest I've ever had, the choice of fine Italian wines is good and despite all this the bill was very reasonable. The following day the restaurant also catered for the buffet following the wedding we attended and again the food was of the highest quality, with a vitello tonnato that was really memorable

7 course New years eve celebration menu. Quality of the food was really below any fine dining standards. Price was 128 S$ / person exluding drinks and it wasn't worth of a penny. Course by course the quality got worse. One soup looked like mud and tasted like mud. Lamb was almost cold on a cold platter. There is two examples.Really dissapointed customers. Definitely no value for the huge amount of money!!

The white truffle menu is delectable! Esp the egg, cheese and asparagus dish - We wiped the plate clean. Roasted scallop in herb crust and the mushroom risotto are both recommended. And keep some space for dark chocolate soufflé and vanilla ice cream.Service was eager if somewhat clumsy and slow

The all-new Italian buffet launched by Pontini is similar to a 4-course Italian meal but in a more lavish manner; Starters (free-flow antipasti, home-made bread, soup at the savoury counter), Primi (unlimited orders of Pizzas and Pasta), Secondi and Desserts. Before you get too excited over the anti-pasta spread or desserts, pen down your main courses so that they would be ready by the the time you finished your appetizers.New sauces and jams always piqued my curiosity to find out their taste and it was the plethora of accompaniments that caught my attention at the savoury table. Instead of pairing them with the Italian Cold Cuts, I walloped them with home-made breads, drizzled some sweet Figs Mustard on the Radicchio, Pear, Gorgonzola cheese salad and Aged balsamic vinegar, and dunked the grilled Portobello mushroom with sweet chilli and arugula salad into Olive Tapenade. As tempting as it is to continue grazing on savories, reserve room for the astoundingly delicious pastas, prepared under the watchful eye of Pontini's head chef, Daniele Sarno. Toothsome penne luxuriates in the creamy pool of "Roman Cabonara" and ham, while in another wee dish, the Tagiolini was coated evenly in "Genovese" style basil pesto sauce, which emitted a strange herby flavour. The so-called Italian Meepok "Tagliatelle" was not bad too, tossed in a jumble of wild mushroom, pancetta, pine nuts and parmesan cheese.  For me, pasta is really the best thing going here and the flavours are very authentically Italian. For a very good price of $48, there is plenty to enjoy at this buffet and you can taste your way through to decide on your favourite. For full review visit blog under user's profil

We have not visited this establishment in many years and decided to visit it for dinner. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a night of great frustration.Right from the phone call to make the booking, we were already slightly annoyed as the restaurant was closed in the morning and our call was taken by the receptionist - we believe this is the front desk of the hotel. Instead of transferring the call, we were given another number to dial, which then bounced us to another number, and then finally to Cafe Brio who took our reservation.On arrival, our booking was not found, and while the staff was very polite, it was not a good start to the evening.Our orders were taken, and it took a full 45 minutes for our first entree to arrive. This was the start of a very very long night. Yes, we ordered the degustation menu and without doubt, it usually takes a little long as each course is cooked only upon finishing the course before. But this was a poorly orchestrated, painfully long drawn out affair. Courses were arriving for some of us at the table and not for the rest and those who had their food arriving first would be done with it by the time the rest got their food. The only time the food all arrived together was the entree. By the time our mains arrived, we gave up being polite to our other guests and just ate as the food was served - if we waited for everyone to have their food before starting, our meals would have been ice cold and soggy.We had a kid with us, and she ordered a kids meal pasta bolognese. Pontini - if you would like to cater to the children, (you do after all have a kids menu), then I strongly suggest you have your service staff briefed on this. The kids meal was not served until we asked 1 hour later and only then was the chef told to start cooking it. It seemed like they were waiting for our mains to be served before the poor child had her kids meal. If the overall service is fast, then that may not be a problem. But the staff were already struggling to get our meals out. If you would like to be family friendly, the least you could do was ask if the kids meal should be served first - like many other restaurants do.The food itself was actually pretty good but it was really difficult to appreciate the quality of the food served when we had to sit there forever and wait for one another to eat their meals. Perhaps this was a bad night in the kitchen for this restaurant in terms of manpower, but it really did not do justice to your food

Had a lovely meal here and was really well looked after as a single lady travelling. I had a pizza and the base was very light and crisp and the filling was delicious.

looked like should be fancy but wasn't.Cooking was only fair,not many dinner guests so presume the conference guests don't eat here
5
gr8 food,,,,flavour,,,we had a private room that was a icing on the cake,,,,,chef came personally to ur table and discussed how we want ur food and delivered the goods ....i guess a good italian hangout

Great food, a little expensive but wonderful ambience. Everyone dresses well to dine at pontini's.

Ended up going to this restaurant because it was raining in torrents and s isn't want to leave the hotel. Told it was quite good but a bit fancy ... Sounded ok. Found the staff pleasant and the atmosphere all right but not exceptional. Varied menu with a nice selection of dishes.Found arrived reasonably promptly and was beautifully presented - I had one of the signature pasta dishes with scampi. Our food tasted fine - but not breath taking lay memorable. The prices were memorable though - especially for the modest serving size. Very expensive - really almost bordering on extortionate...

September 2013... Very good to excellent dinner. Food was well prepared and presented. All dishes tasted great. Quantity of food was good for upscale Italian restaurants. The atmosphere was good and the restaurant was clean and tastefully decorated. Service was excellent and has good knowledge of the dishes served. Overall a very good business dining experience

Second time eating here.I like the expansive, spacious but nice spartan interior. Food is still good and lovingly prepared.Had their Berkshire belly pork, but somehow as Singaporean I still prefer pork with less of a nose.Their pizza with foie gras, truffles and mushroom are refreshingly good.We dined on a weekday night and the restaurant was perhaps three quarters full, and the young waitresses seems to be at a loss sometimes,aimlessly wandering around with tunnel vision. This needs improvement

They say if you want good food then don't eat at the hotels in Singapore, but it was a wet night and....Lesson learnt once again!We dined at Pontini with great expectations. The evening started off of the wrong foot with the doorman telling me my dress for the evening wasn't appropriate, a quick trip to the room and we were back on track... how was I to know ultra smart casual long shorts weren't acceptable wear when I hadn't read the dress code! The door man taught me a lesson that I think was going to haunt me all night. thank you Mr Doorman!Back to the review. The restaurant is well appointed best described as pleasant. Being a Saturday night the place was pretty full, mostly with local's, you know the ones with all the money and little sense, oh and there was the odd guest mixed in to. Crazy really the restaurant won't let you through with a certain pair of trousers but it doesn't seem to be too concerned about the nice locals children running a muck... Not that I'm bitter at all!Back to thee food and stuff. We ordered two mains, desert and coffee. My main was the chef's signiture lamb and whilst the flavours were there, two small cutlets a square of potato and a spoon full of veggies really didn't constitute a main meal in my mind. My wife ordered the chicken and again nice food but simply not enough. Dinner was enjoyed with two glasses of wine (Itallian wine and worth buffing up on what's what before you go, at $25 a glass plus plus its an expensive mistake if you pick the wrong glass worse still the wrong bottle. Mind you I'm thinking that the bulk of the locals had little or no idea what they were drinking and to tell you the truth I was no different). Desert was served quickly despite us requesting time to finish our wine, we reminded the waiter of our request and it was taken back for a while, a while, a while... I think you get the idea. When served the desert was good. Realy not much to complain about, mind you not much to rave about either.Dinner ended up costing $270 for two people for the evening and whilst I don't have a probem with spending good money for a great dining experience I simply didn't feel the experience warranted the cost on this occasion. I guess if your not paying the bill, or not interested in the price then go for it, I on the other hand can think of hundreds of ways to spend $270 other than at Pontini. Sorry we wont be bac

My husband and I used to live in Singapore and enjoyed eating at Pontini from time to time. It had been a while since we'd been there, until last evening: Chef Daniele Sarno has been there about 6 months, and he's terrific: our mains (ossobucco & pappadelle w/ braised beef) were superb. A little issue re. our (shared) starter was immediate rectified and Chef came out to check all was good, moments later. We really enjoyed the conversation that ensued (cooking, Florence -- what's not to like?) and determined to return next time we're in Singapore

Pontini is a very nice restaurant, good service and fantastic food. The seafood risotto is one of the best in town, tasty and well presented. The seafood pot with barley is also good, and the borlito meat is awesome. Ted, the philipino waiter goes over miles to make the customer happy and the indian restastaurant manager very helpful. My wife, quite nasty did not complained at all! Good job Pontini!

Excellent Italian food but pricey

After the renovations, not worth coming as they have taken away the anti-pasti buffet. And the wine is no longer discounted with the Ala carte card :(

Reasonable quality but nothing to shout about.

Expensive Italian dining... wud rather go Prego!

We apologize but the quality of food, not comparable to the high price, we eat but nothing special, good bread, but pizza and pasta dishes, so-so. We will return to the hotel, but not at this restaurant inside the hotel. better meals at the buffet on the ground floor

This is the first time I am writing a restaurant review. I have eaten several times at this place over the last four months with my family. We are completely satisfied about the food, pasta and rissotto, mains dishes are cooked to the perfectionand desserts are light and very good.Unfortunately the service is disorganized and the waiters without knowledge of the food. Only the Indian guy is very helpfull! The manager is most of the times talking over the phone walking here and there.......that's terrible! For my opinion this restaurant has got potential to be better

Pontini's held a good place in my heart and head from many a years back when this restaurant opened with the Grand Copthorne. i had the opporunity to revisit this restaurant on three occassions over three days in March due to a large meeting we were hosting there.To put it midly, the food quality was just plain bad. Whether it was the buffet served in the outlet (perhaps it was not from their kitchen), or the a la carte options provided on another day, the food quality was simply not up to scratch, and for a restaurant of this 'statue', i would say downright pathetic. Perhaps the issue was that we were not walk in guest, but part of a meeting. That being said, if that was the attitude, then i would just say that the outlet has just sold itself short. i did notice other tables who had a la carte orders and they did look much better and appealing.Service wise, at lunch, the service was mediorce, if not poor. We had waitresses who did not understand (or did not seem to) request for water, bread etc. And i am refering to at least 2 separate waitresses, one probably Chinese, the other perhaps from the Philippines. The only saving grace was the restaurant manager- but surely he cant be waiting all tables and handling every request.For me, i would not go back in my spare time. For italian food, in Singapore, loads more better ones in the vicinity

While staying at the Grand Copthorne hotel we visited this restaurant. The decor is absolutely beautiful, with water features in the entryway and very pretty views out the windows. The Staff was friendly and kind. The service was fast. We only had dessert and both of us were pleased with our choices. The downside is it is quite expensive and there is no privacy. However it was just what we were looking for for our dessert, with many selections. We had dinner at another Italian place in Singapore and were glad we chose making the trip and having our meal there instead.

Despite I reminded the waiter 2 times I had to wait 15 min for a white Martini I ordered. They had to get the Martini from the Bar in the lobby of the hotel and brought a Vermouth instead a Martini.The Mushroom soup was excellent but was nearly served same time as the apperitiv. The it took a long time until I got my glass of wine, where again I had to remind the waiter of my order.The risotto with foie gras was excellent, but the foie gras had just one third of the size shown on the picture at the entrance. So I asked for the owner Domenico, which came and understood why I was not happy at all with the service and the size of foie gras served.I appreciated a lot the gesture of Domenico who served me then for free a starter plate with a lot of foie gras which was really excellent.So I left a bit less dissapointed the restaurant but nevertheless I cannot recommand it.To pay 98 SGD for 1 Martini 1 Glass of red wine a soup and a risotto with 40gr of foie gras is just simply taking it from the tourists

I had one of the most extraordinary meals today ever. My taste buds have with age become so jaded that very rarely does a meal excite as much as the one which I had today. Among the highlights for me were a kingfish carpaccio accompanied by 4 little dollops of calamansi jelly, an angel hair pasta topped with tenderly cooked razor clam, a delicately pan-fried cod wrapped in parma ham and stuffed with caramelised endives sitting on a little bed of black lentils and a perfectly done beef tenderloin served with a truffle jus. Should I mention the delicious cheese course which surprised one's taste buds with its surprising blend of savoury and sweet bursts of flavour as well as the 3 desserts which followed, all different in their interpretation of fairly traditional desserts?Most of the dishes which we 'sampled' today are off-menu. My advice is to give Chef Frank Killan carte blanche if you go to Pontini and you will definitely not be disappointed. In fact, you will probably be treated to a meal which will long linger in the memory of your food soul

Great lunchtime fare...
