We didn't try Bak kut teh, we ordered pork/chicken/shrimp rice instead. The courses are more delicious than we expected, and price is acceptale for tourist, about 10SGD for 1 course, 1 vegetable and 1 drinks. Maybe we will come back for Bak kut teh

I found this restaurant at Tanjong Pagar which is about 5 minutes walk from Chinatown, they have Singapore well-known Bak Kut Teh, the soup is peppery hot, I also tried their Prawn Sauce Fried Chicken Wings, my kind of taste, savoury! Sad that I couldn't try the Singapore famous Chilli Crab that I've to pre-order

We chanced upon this place while desperately searching for late night dinner. Most of the shops were closed, while this Resto was not only open, the waiter was even inviting inside the guests who stopped awhile to look at the menu. We tried lean meat pork soup with noodles (special order), seafood rice, seafood noodles, stir fried squid in spicy sauce, kangkong in garlic. Everything turned out really well. Meat was soft and tasty, soup was soothing, without the usual aroma and taste that usually come with pork soup. Great taste of the squid and shrimps in both the noodles and fried rice variety. Service was good - waiter was very helpful to first-timers, attentive to every call and quick to serve the meal. Place is airconditioned, so it is ideal for casual lunch or dinner with friends.Next time, we'll go for another item in the menu, the bak kut teh, a local favorite in Singapore.

Although I am not a connoisseur, this is according to my untrained taste buds, one of the better Bak Kut Teh that I had.The broth was full of flavour without being overpowering and the meat on the ribs was practically falling off the bone tender. Another highlight was the ability to order "spare parts in a a variety of ways. For me, the "spare part" soup was just wonderful.The rice and Yew Char Kway were excellent compliment to the rather brothy dining experience

Overall, the soups were nice and it was a simple, comfortable air-con setting with very fast service. They also serve a number of fried vegetables and dishes. Our rating: 7 out of 10 (Ambience: 7, Service: 8, Taste: 7, Presentation: 7, Value-for-Money: 6.5).Their original recipe Bak Kut Teh Soup ($7.80, or $10.80 with prime ribs) is the cloudy, herbal type rather than the clear peppery type. We liked the richness of the soup (refill is free), and the meat was quite soft. Just very few pieces for $7.80 thoughâ€¦The Special Braised Pigâ€™s Trotters ($7.80) came with fragrant, thick black sauce which went nicely with rice (at $0.60 per bowl). The Kidney Soup ($8.80) had a nice, herbal aroma with ginger, but our complaint was again that the portion seemed quite small.For more information and photos, refer to our blog at http://angiekayexplorer.com/2015/07/15/xin-mei-le-bak-kut-teh-tanjong-pagar
