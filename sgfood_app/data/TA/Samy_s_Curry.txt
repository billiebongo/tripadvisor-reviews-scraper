One of the more affordable and good curry fish heads! It comes with the papadum, so when dipped in curry, the crisp brings out the fragance of the spices in the curry! A go to place when carving for good curry fish head! :)

After all these years, it’s still a fantastic place to eat South Indian cuisine.
What was interesting was the wine list. My friend wasn’t aware they now carry a decent selection of wine. They charge for corkage if you decide to bring your own grog.
4
The food and location is excellent. If you want to have excellent Indian food with old environment setup.
This is correct place. Service is really good
5
Authentic, Unassuming and value for money! This has got to be hands down the best South Indian restaurant in Singapore. Nothing beats perspiring in the non-airconditioned room with their fish head curry.

16 of us met for CNY lunch and enjoyed great food on banana leaf. With more people you can try several dishes as we had an excellent chicken, squid, prawns, cauliflower and mutton all served with rice and 2 veg. The service was good and food excellently cooked and tasty.This is a casual place to eat so don't expect 5* atmosphere, facilities etc. However if you want a nice S Indian meal there are few better places. At $30/head it is good value too.
5
Excellent location up hill with many other types of restaurants and a beautiful surrounding with gardens and out door seatings. The food is really excellent, great taste and freshly cooked and typical home cooking based on tradtional and authentic recipes from the South and North Indian cuisine. Prices are moderate but yet value for money! Good service and friendly staff. When visiting Singapore, you should visit this restaurant and the location. A memorable experience
5
This place offers an incredible curry meal for as low as 10sgd. They offer as much rice as you can eat served with two vegetable dishes. You then choose chicken or fish gravy for your rice. From the menu you select a meat to go with it all and itâ€™s all served on a banana leaf in front of you in a open air casual restaurant. Absolutely incredibl

This place didn't look like the sort of place I'd usually eat, but I was proved wrong - the food was amazing! It tasted just like my boyfriend's Mum's food (she's Indian) which is a good thing! It was fun having it served on a banana leaf and the portions were very generous. The dahl was delicious, as were the naan and biryani, and the lamb curry was amazing, and just spicy enough
4
Great Indian food for anyone wanting to soak up on some fresh, delicious and tasteful spicy food. Yes Indian food is spicy but I reiterate its tastefully prepared with care not to allow the spicyness to overpower the taste.Make sure to work out a huge appetite before heading towards this restaurant and do get there before 12:30 noon as it tends to fill up fast.. The atmospehre is a typical Indian restaurant set up and there's sitting area in the patio as well which is where we sat as it was much cooler away from the humidity..Great banana leaf style food served with lots of rice, authentically prepared Indian veggies, rasam ( Indian Soup), papadams served on the side and you will have to order the meat dishes from inside as these dishes are displayed at the counter...so do indulge yourselves at this place as its really really good. Reasonably priced menu..xxStaff are friendly and very accomodating..especially the lady who served us.Worth the visit. Will definitely go there when I do return back to Singapore soon
5
Great traditional curry place. Staff are very attentive, sincere and friendly, from the boss all the way down to the servers , and the food is tasty. Shout out to one of our server, Mani, for the great and friendly service!Best teh tarik like a traditional sarabat stall!Rice and vegetables are served via the traditional way with the tiffin trays
4
Great Indian banana leaf curry meal with spicy fish head and the usual fried chicken, masala chicken, papadam, mutton, squid. Value for money
4
Pretty simple concept. Big banana leaf on a melamine table, lots of different curry dishes up on it with some bread and rice. Decent spice and lots of cold beers. Job done.
5
Set in a ‘tropical’ location, this traditional style restaurant served excellent food on banana leaves. I particularly recommend the butter chicken and naan as well the coconut water. Overall a wonderful dining experience, however, there was a lack of air conditioning and transportation routes via MRT or taxi stands, you will need an Uber!!
5
I have been to this place twice with friends. It is one of those eating establishments which serve delicious, unpretentious Indian curry rice to regulars for decades. I have tried the fish and chicken curries, which comes with vegetable sides, and they have been delicious. I quite like the Masala tea as well. Being served on a banana leaf by waiters with tins and scoops is a feel-good experience too. The meals cost about S$10.It is my respite from mediocre Indian food served elsewhere. The only drawback is a less than ideal location, which is hard to reach without a car. Service is pretty standard
4
Enjoyed a curry lunch on the outside verandah with a group of six diners. The service was attentive and prompt and the curry recommendations were good. We had the fish head curry which I gather is the house speciality plus a variety of other dishes. The mutton curry was excellent. All served on a banana leaf! The jugs of Tiger beer were a perfect accompaniment.Dempsey is a peaceful oasis that offers a variety of dining options, just across from the Botanical Gardens which proved a welcome place for a post-lunch stroll
3
3 of us had Masala chicken , curry mutton and Butter curry chicken.Their masala chicken was average only, though it is what they are good at.We didn't try the curry fish head though we did notice most other tables ordered that.Butter curry chicken was better than the masala chicken.Mutton curry was ok, nothing to wow about.Service was however disappointing. The waiter gave us very little vege in our first serving, literally only a tablespoon of vegetable. When we asked for second helping, they just conveniently ignored us and several times even with repeated reminders did not come back to us
4
Samy’s is truly a Singapore institution wheee the food is served on banana leaves and you eat what hey have cooked. We arrived at 2 pm and that may explain why the food was a little tired but it is still one of he best experiences in town. Do not miss it
3
I was having business dinner yesterday. Foods was at average level in general, but I like the Teh tarik. I tried the famous mutton, texture is soft but I found quite spicy for certain people. I recommend the restaurant owner should consider to reduce the size of chicken piece, because once they served was shocked how big it is. Honestly I don't think it will boost your appetite if you see one whole piece of "alien chicken" being thrown in front of you. Staff over there was doing a good job in serving customer
4
A long way from the tourist strip, Samy's is good authentic Indian food in comfortable surroundings. We opted for the verandah with a ceiling fan rather than the air-conditioned room. Rice, dahl and beans served on banana leaf with a lots of curries to choose from.Go for the fish head curry - just brilliant. The prawn sambal was great too.One of those unique experiences for those not from Singapore, but don't expect luxury
2
Went in for a party with a lot of expectations created by the reviews on the internet.Certainly the curries are rich and interesting...but post the meal, I note that the restaurant extensively uses food colouring. Even after two hours and two washes, I can’t get the colouring off...Puts me off a bit as I wonder what do they use and why..
5
it's by no means food from india. it's local indian food - and the best that is among all the indian restaurants around.
4
An old colonial building houses this restaurant. We sat outside on the verandah and enjoyed the evening air with the help of some ceiling fans. The place was busy with people and it was therefore nice to sit outside where it was a bit quieter. The meal was authentic and delicious. Your plate is a big banana leaf on which your food is placed. Delicious Indian dishes
5
Been coming to Samy’s for 15 years. We visit Singapore at least every 2-3yrs and always eat at Samy’s! Booked the outside verandah. Staff very attentive and food was of course amazing! Ate off the banana leaf and staff came around with the offerings. Problem is my eyes are always too big for my belly- but I did a good job to fit it in. Just too good. We will be back for sure
4
A group of us went for lunch and shared a variety of curries dished up on banana leaves. Scrumptious! Renown for its fish head curry, Samy's has been in business for over 50 years so it must be doing something right. Good service. Lots of parking
5
What a fantastic place and I had the best fish head curry I have had in years, overall fantastic food. Location is simply wonderful in Dempsey Rd away from the city hype and you almost feel like you are in the country side and you can sit outside. Great value for money
5
We are great fans of fish head curry and our friends took us to Samy's.The food and service was excellent !Some of favorites were fish head curry , fish cutlets , dry mutton curry and an unusual pumpkin stew /gravy .Having banana leaves instead of ceramic plates added a special local touch.The service was great - many waiters hovering around to serve us
5
I was visiting from Australia with my Hubby and have been here years ago. This place is still the best after so many years . The food is simply amazing . How do you compare this to another South Indian , I cannot fathom. The chicken masala was so nice and hot and spicy , the fish moolie delightful and the mysore mutton was righly spiced . We had the Briyani rice and when arrived was fragant and long grained as it should be. No fault , just amazing South indian at its finest 
4
This is my first visit to this place, and I ordered the signature Fish head curry, Fish Roe, Tandoori Chicken to go along with my favorite Kingfisher beer.The Fish head curry and the Fish Roe is fantastic yummy! The Tandoori Chicken is as delicious but the actual serving is little smaller than the menu’s photo. Very good staff service !Well worth a visit and will definitely come back again
3
Fish Head Curry here is still one of the best, but the other dishes were just so-so. I ordered liver but the dish contained only giblets. The only other thing I enjoy here is the lentils and vegetables that come served with the rice. Even the papadam was somewhat inconsistent with the non-crispy/soft texture. I will still come back for the vegetable lentils which they serve with the rice and also maybe the fish cutlet
3
We were a group of 17 persons and the waiter just said he would bring the food , no menu was offered, so we thought it was a fixed price and fixed menu . They kept piling food on our plates and at the end , the bill was a ridiculous Singapore $ 70- per head ( including some beer and 3 only eating vegetarian) . Many of us wasted food which had just been given to us . Definitely our fault for not controlling the event better , so hope people read this and do not get taken for a ride like we were. Actually ,having eaten all over Singapore in last 40 years , I think there are many excellent Indian restaurants with food as good as Samys at better prices. It is not unique 
2
Really disappointed by Samys tonight. Ask to see the big and small portion plates. There are really small and $13 for the large. Come on Samys it never used to be like that.
4
It is noisy, somewhat chaotic, hot (although the fans help) and busy. But don't worry about the ambience, you are coming here of the food, and Samy's Curry delivers. Great food, even if a lot of it is slopped onto your banana leaf with all the finesse of a warthog passing wind. Some of the dishes are a tad expensive... $9+ for small plate of cauliflower, for example, is a little steep.Recommended, but don't expect silver service
5
While in Singapore a local suggested we try Samy’s Curry & we are so glad we did. It’s a little way out but grab a cab & head there for great Indian food, the service was also very friendly & they even called a taxi for us when we were ready to leave. It was also a novelty to eat off banana leaves it really added to the experience. All in all a great night was had & will certainly return next time we are in Singapore.
5
I'm a fan of Indian food, but sadly live in the States so don't always get the best. After seeing Samy's featured on Anthony Bourdain, I had very high expectations, and Samy's exceeded ALL of them. If you are in Singapore, you must go here. Highlights:- Lime juice. Get the pitcher. By the glass is not enough. I ordered a ton of lime juice from different places when I was here, and this lime juice here blew them all away. - Biryani. Comes with two great side dishes and served on a banana leaf.- Masala chicken - so flavorful. The spiciness sneaks up on you though, which is why you need that lime juice!- Fish head curry - great flavor and plenty of meat on the fish head too! I would order this with a large group because it was a pretty big portion size. Also, something I wish I had known - you're supposed to wrap up your banana leaf when you're done and before you leave the table. I didn't realize that we were supposed to do this so think we might have come off a little rude. Sorry Samy! Next time I come to Singapore, I'm asking my cab to take me straight from Changi to Samy's
4
Went with a large group to Samy's. It was a fun experience, with good food and service. We had several curry dishes from lamb and chicken, to snapper and prawns. All very good. Eat with your hands or a fork, no one cares. Only issue related to a food allergy, when they brought strawberry ice cream by mistake to one in our party who cannot eat strawberries. Fortunately nothing major resulted
4
A group of six of us went to samy's curry at Dempsey road.recently.AS usual e ordered masala chicken, big prawns, Mysore mutton and fish head. As stated the dishes has been there for many years and the dishes standout good and worth ordering. We had 'ream',a Indian soup good for digestion.We finally had a masala tea.It was worth a trip to this restaurant for good south indian food
5
It took us too long to get to this place but when we did we were hooked. Service is fast, prices are reasonable and the fish head curry is the best I've had the man even came took the fish out of the curry and help get as much meat from the fish. Fish tikka was the best priced we had in singapore and it was lovely
5
Samy's Curry is nothing like the predictable South Indian restaurants along Little India. For starters, it's not in Little India but in the hip surrounds of Dempsey Village. Away from the beaten track, Samy's serves its legendary fare on a real Banana Leaf. Housed in the cavernous former Civil Service Club hall with its lazy fans it will certainly takes you back to the good old days of afternoon Tiffin. Service can be improved but the quality of food, especially its signature Chicken Masala is to die-for
4
Great place for visitors if you want to avoid the very busy serangoon road. Samy's is a big place with reasonable selection of all they are good at. Everything was fresh and good. Mysore mutton - 4 starsMasala Chicken - 4 stars Chicken 65 - 3 stars Fried fish cut piece - 3 stars Vege's- 4 stars Overall very good food and great to bring your visiting friend and family.
5
Have been wanting to come here for ages with my Singaporean Indian friend and finally made it. Was definitely not disappointed. The food was excellent and tasty (good having someone there to order for us) and is reasonably priced. Some reviews have mentioned poor service however we did not experience that. Our server was friendly and delivery was prompt. Definitely recommend Samy's for an Indian feast.
1
They said that the butter chicken was not spicy but it was way too spicy!I do not recommend this place.
4
A Banana leaf curry experience. Basic menu but the food taste great. Historic setting in a not so modern part of Singapore. Good service.
5
Don't judge a book by it cover! Looks a bit ordinary! At first we were thinking wouldn't stay but very glad we did. We had the fish head curry, mutton curry, vegetables. Wow all delicious with there own unique flavours. They brought out a large square banana leaf, I thought was going to be the place mat. No it was our plate. Along came the condiments. Then the dishes we ordered. Superb and certainly authentic!
4
The food here taste just like what it was 30 years ago and its not for the faint-hearted. However, we see a good variety of clientele raging from westerners, local Chinese and Indians. People that are wooed by its pungent, right at your face and rustic southern India style Indian cuisine. The curry fish-head and the curry mutton are my all time favorites. I will always finish the meal with a glass of lassi yogurt to help neutralize the potent spices. Housed in a colonial style cookhouse and not air-conditioned. Service was always chaotic. But who cares, just bring me my curry
5
No one should visit Singapore without eating at Samy's Curry if they want to experience the old era feel of real banana leaf curry. This is the best place - venue + quality - to enjoy this Singapore standard. Don't expect a bargain here as quality and location come at a premium...but it's worth it! Samy's is always a great place to eat! Yum
5
Samy's has been a habit now, we frequently go there for lunch and never regret it.Services is fast, food is fresh and tasty and reasonably priced. They serve the best Rasam and Sambhar in Singapore and their 2 veggies of the day compliment the meal well along with Pappadums.Must visit when in Singapore. And yes, I didn't mention about Yummy fish head curry, various meat and seafood dishes
2
There is a relatively small menu selection and the taste is not that great. Beer is cold but is not really compensating for the poor food selection. Service was reasonably fast and polite, but nothing special. If you want Indian food in Singapore may want to try other restaurants. One other aspect they could improve is the general cleanliness - entire place could use a good scrub. I would not recommend and will not return.
5
It was soo soo yummy!!! So glad we ate here! It was our first time experience this kind of dinning. The staff were all so nice helping us out! Our table mates were also very helpful, giving us ideas on how to order! I really enjoyed eating authentic Indian food with my hand!!!
4
The restaurant is located in a colonial building in the green and quiet Dempsey Road vicinity. The location is well served by buses that ply along Holland Road. We had the masala chicken with white rice drenched with curry. The accompaniments were pureed pumpkin and chopped beans as well as crispy and delicious pappadum. We also ordered a piece of fried fish to share and had refreshing lime juice to mitigate the heat of a searing Sunday afternoon. The meal for two while not cheap was quite reasonable at slightly more than $30
4
Recommended by a local friend and took a couple of friends visiting for a Sunday night dinner. We walked in around 7:30 and had no problems getting a table outside. It was a breezy night and so not hot at all (they also have fans).This is 'no frills' dining at Dempsey hill - they have a couple of types of beer but that's it. Typical Singapore drinks and Indian drinks like lime juice and mango lassi also on the menu but it is the food that you need to try.The fish head curry is the standard and recommended dish - lovely in a pot of sauce with aubergine and served with rice (additional charge). We also had naan, veg biryani, butter chicken and tikka chicken. YUMMY! We were so stuffed by the end.With beer, it came to around $30, per head. Very affordable and it is a lovely little place with abundant food choices around
5
The food is great and affordable. Very nice to sit outside, surrounded by greenery and drink beer in the evening.
4
We were quickly served by a waiter when we stand near at the food counter. The medium-size fish-head curry was fresh, tasty and not so spicy. I also like the vegetable dish that has cottage cheese and smashed spinach.
2
This is a much frequented place by both working people and families. You can definitely find better curries with better pricing in other parts of Singapore. Seriously nothing much to rave about at all, probably except the location which is easily accessible.
4
If you want just good plain tasty Indian food then head to Sammys which is located in what was the old Civil Service Mess -so a real part off Singapore hIstory thrown in This is back to basics -choose from the various Indian curries which are served in huge portions on a banana leaf and delight in the flavours and smells ,Washed down with a cold Beer or Fresh Lime Juice --perfection all round at a very reasonable price .Anyone visiting Singapore who like Indian food and nostalgia should visit here and very close to the Botanical Gardens as well
4
Went with a group who have made Samy's a tradition and now I see why. Reserved a table in the air conditioned rear area which was a nice way to control the external heat while focusing on the lovely spicy food. Fish head curry, chicken masala, black squid, biryani, na'an and more. Served on banana leaf though we used cutlery instead of hands. Very authentic flavours and a perfect level of spice. Enough to make the beads of sweat pop on my head but really just nice and tingly to the mouth. Great flavour in the fish head curry. A great experience and satisfied my need for some comfort food.
4
Haven't been here for a Long Long time.Great masala chicken! My all time favourite. Ask for more masala gravy. They also have very good chicken liver but it is very very spicy.The only other thing I eat at Samy's is the fish head curry which is also good.But for today it is masala chicken with briyani rice
5
I have been coming to Samy's since I was young. The place is always packed with local Singaporeans which is evidence of the great food served at Samy's Curry consistently. If you are in the mood for spicy South Indian fare, look no further. You must try the dry mutton and the fish cakes. Enjoy
4
We went here last nightServed by ManiOrder :Fish Curry HeadTandoori Chicken Butter Chicken CauliflowerSotongBiryaniBiryani were goodIt was free flowIncluding the curry and side dish also free flowFish curry head I love itNever try something like this beforeIts my favouriteTandoori chicken is not coming , instead masala chicken coming out (not sure why)Taste very spicyCauliflower : amazing!My favourite !!!Butter chicken is greatFinally tandoori chicken coming after we askIts good but we are full alreadyReccomended!Great service from Mani 
5
Set in old army barracks area. No frills. Wonderful food. Dry beef was best dish. Chicken, Dahl and wet beef also great. Don't forget the chicken gravy on the rice. Heat factor medium hot. Wash down with jug of tiger and a cool lime juice. Well patronised by locals.
4
While Singapore’s Indian food scene is typically associated with a hub of Indian restaurants in Little India area, there are other spots that can hold their own.What this no-frills eatery in Dempsey lacks in atmosphere it makes up for with cooking. Quite old school in its touches, Samy’s Curry is deservedly popular.There are the traditional items – chicken masala, etc – but for something different, try the butter chicken and biryanis. Worth mentioning is the curry fish head with its delightfully delicate meat that only Singapore gourmets and American cats know much about. It’s not going to blow your mind, but you won’t be disappointed while the still-warm freshness of the popadoms and naan breads provides the icing on the cake. Wash it down with an Indian-style thick lassi to balance out the heat.Some like it hot, some are born to be mild, but everyone loves a decent curry. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
5
Overtime we go to Singapore we go there, at least twice! Masala chicken is a must have. I personally love the Crab curry. Best beverage to drink is the ice cold coconuts. Food is served super fast and the staff is very friendly.
5
Samy's has the charm of British colonialism and the food is very good! If you love Indian food and are in Singapore, don't miss this place.
4
If you are a curry lover don't miss Samy's. The curries are full on and all pack a punch. Fun place where you can mix it up with the locals.
5
Good food, good ambient and great experience. We just love it so much and we will return soon. You need a transport or taxi to reach there.
5
In my opinion, having eaten curry in more places than I can count and having visited India for work and holidays lots of times, yes.Atmosphere: check. Hot, steamy, veranda, plastic tables and chairs, surrounded by jungle. The definition of authentic.Service: check. Friendly, quick, helpful.Food: check: The menu never changes. That is good. Every single item is perfect. The highlight is the dry mutton - I have never had anything like as good as this anywhere. Always get them to bring items to the table to serve rather than going off the actual menu (unless you want something specific like fish head curry). Any make sure you skip breakfast or lunch as you will need plenty of space.That little extra: check. You eat of banana leaves, and (for the westerners who are reading this go with me here...) with your hands.If I visit Singapore and I do not visit Samy's I consider it a wasted trip
4
The restaurant is located in the upmarket area and is known for its Indian Non Veg food. The place is neat and clean and has ample seating, the staff is extremely courteous, but service for some items can be slow. The food was average and not upto the big hype surrounding it for the Indian Non Veg Food. The Biryani rice was average, cold and is served with normal thali accompaniments. You do not get raitha or salads with the Biryani Rice. The side dishes were also not upto the mark. The waiters kept us waiting for hot water and did not serve till the end. It is an average restaurant and may have done down the hill from its old glory days. Not recommended highly
5
Wife and I has been literally eating our way around Singapore prior to our cruise ship leaving the following day. We finally got back to our hotel in the early evening fairly satiated with some of the best Singapore offers. As the night was still young, my wife said what are we gonna do now...can you eat again, I replied that I would like to try fish head stew at Samy's Curry on Dempsey Hill. She said let's go... we grab a cab and 10 minutes later we are sitting in a movie set of an old style Singapore restaurant surrounded with some of the best food I have ever eaten. The fish head stew is something to savour , especially if you like spice. Easily the most memorable and best restaurant we visited in Singapore
2
Samy's has been a huge favourite of mine for years. I not only go there frequently but take many overseas visitors. The food and service have always been great. However, I've noticed a very sharp drop in service standards on the last couple of trips. The service staff appears to be very surly - almost as if they've been instructed to be so. They've started hustling and are unhappy if you don't order whatever overpriced dishes they are trying to push. No one in my family eats fish head and many are allergic to seafood. But when I ordered other meats and wouldn't order seafood dishes and fish head curries, our waiter wouldn't take no for an answer and kept insisting I order some. It was quite irritating. A pity because the food still remains decent. I'm heading to Banana Leaf Apollo the next time
3
Been to this restaurant numerous times in last 10 years or more. Had always think their food is great, as good as those popular and well known ones in little India like the Banana Leaf, Muthu's curry etc etc This is a shocker! Service was bad with a bad mood waiter who actually displayed unhappiness when it took us less than 10 mins to give him order for 5 people which is not unreasonable though we made some changes. He continued to be rather impatient when he offered the sauces and vege.. Next, over $6 for a prawn that was like medium size! Ridiculous priced! I remembered eating much bigger prawns in that restaurant! Big fish head also doesn't come with enough fish with the head so at the end of the day, I think we were filled up with drinks than the meal itself though we also ordered tandoori chicken. Worse of all is the briyani rice!! It came in bits of chunk rice that's almost white!!! It was pathetic and disappointing dinner! However, they are fully packed. Guess that's when they think they can slack in their food quality and service since there are so many patrons anyway? Well, there isn't any other restaurant alike in DEMPSEY and if you are foreigners, you probably don't know where else to go? No match at all with those Banana Leaf and Muthu's in Farrer Park/Little India area. I think I need to visit one soon and I felt so cheated by Samy's. Never return ever again!
4
Among the locals Samy's curry house has become something of an institution! It specialised in Indian vegetarian curries served on a banana leaf, although there are plenty of meat and fish dishes to choose from too. Indeed, their fish head curry is truly excellent. It is located well off the tourist track and most of its clientele are locals. Well worth a visit
5
What more can you want? Authentic curry. Great food especially the Mysore Mutton and tandoori chicken.
5
It was nice to get outside the urban area in be in a different part of Singapore. The grounds are a former nutmeg plantation and British army barracks. The food was delicious. Enjoyed the mutton curry and chicken masala as well as the sides.
4
This is one of the most authentic Indian restaurants I've been to outside India. The authenticity applies to not only the food, but the restaurant decore, atmosphere and the waiters.
3
Whilst Samys has rather overextended its menu recently, the old standbys are still v good: mysore mutton, chicken tikka, fish head curry, etc. All served on a banana leaf with a pile of rice and swilled down with icy draft beer
4
Not the service, ambiance or other Indian food. The Fish Head Curry was exceptional, but the rest of the meal was average, and servers had minimal English-language skills making ordering an adventure.
4
I have been here a few times years back. Upon my return to my homeland to celebrate my friend's birthday we packed the food and had the works.We ordered the crab masala, prawn masala, fish head curry, chicken masala. mysore mutton, chicken liver, fried fish, papadam, briyani rice and white rice.Simply Awesome and you will not regret if you like Indian Spicy food.We had a great birthday bash with Heineken and Tiger Beer
3
Eating alfresco on a cool afternoon, with fans whirling above, I tucked into garlic naan, butter chicken and gobi (cauliflower). Crunched on poppadum. Washed it all down with refreshing lime juice. That's the life!Food was reasonably good, moderately priced and the service was unobtrusive. I chose to visit at 1.30 pm, by which time the lunch crowd had dispersed, so finding a table was easy. Friend and I had a leisurely lunch. I would definitely do this again.Oh... did I mention the ample parking space? Free too :
4
This was my first experience with banana leaf plated food. But it was quite tasty, and inexpensive. This is not a fancy place ... no way would one consider it for a romantic date ... way too much florescent lighting! Still, for a good taste of southern Indian food, this place is a good bet
5
As an Fellow indian, it can be difficult to find for good indian food which really fills you up and satisfies you. I am glad to say that this is considered to be one of those places which does this. Rice will keep coming in while you finish your food on the Banana Leaf provided and the curry and the dishes are tasty enough that you might want to ask for more. Always ask for their Fish Puttu which goes so well with their curry rice. The place is about comfort food and i would say it would be a great place for good indian food. The price is reasonable and i would say that you will leave the restaurant full and happy. Don't also forget to order with their Lime juice as well! When i went there , it was my uncle's birthday and they switched off the lights to bring the cake in to surprise him and he was happy about it. They are easy to talk to if you would like to have a simple surprise for your family membe
5
I love this place, my family has been coming here for ages. The food is always a treat, as well as the vibe. It's a bit more old school than what Singapore normally looks like and there's lots of bars in the Dempsey area to check out for a drink after. Definitely a cool add-on to the Singapore experience. I bring friends passing through the country here all the time and they always love it. If you have no spice tolerance, be clear though
5
Fast service and food fish curry & masala chicken.. very friendly staff. Definitely recommend them. ...............
4
We had a nice lunch here. The only thing we found too oily was the squid. Picture & actual presentation totally off. Naam, fish-head curry, tandoori chicken was delicious.
3
A decent option to go out for a casual dinner with friends or family. Not many options, in case you are a vegetarian.
5
Samy's was recommended to us by a coworker who lived in Singapore for many years. This is off the beaten path for tourists but worth the trip! Very reasonable prices, friendly service and great flavor- This family owned and operated establishment is a must on any list of dining places for a visit to singapore! And Dempsy hill is a great place to experience while in Singapore

Samy's Curry is one of the oldest Curry Restaurants in Singapore, situated in an historical colonial house. The Food is served in banana leaves. The ambiente is not high class, nur the food is autentic and realy good. I Love the chicken tikka Marshalls, the dry mutton Curry and the BÃ¼roangestellte Rice.The service is typical Indian
4
Probably through all the advertising on various food shows this place has become a bit overpriced, the same - btw excellent - quality of food can be had in Little India for about half the price.If you are only briefly in town you cant miss with this one but if you have more time on your hands dive into Little India for this food experience

Invited by family for lunch. Havent been there for years. The food is still good. Chicken masala as usual spicy and good. Naan has not changed.Portions served are smaller, no complains from me because the quality is there. All of us enjoyed the food. Try the fried promfret. Very nice

Was invited here by a friend for lunch and the first thing which you like is the ambience. Set in the earlier military barracks, it takes you back in time to a somewhat canteen look in a barrack.We ordered some beer to start which was good considering the fish head which followed was spicy. So the beer helped in enjoying the spice.Fish head curry with plain white rice was a first for me and was absolutely delicious. Ample servings of vegetables and dal (lentils) enjoyed on a banana leaf with your fingers and licking the fish head curry of your fingers is a great feeling.An absolute must try specially for lunch when it's hot and not very crowded.

Established in 1970 (the old Civil Service Sports Club), I've been frequenting 'Samy's' restaurant since 1982. In other words hundreds of times!Obviously the curry is amazingly good, sometimes you dream about it. My favorites include masala chicken (breast), mutton Mysore (wet) and pregnant squid which are to die for. Kingfisher beer compliments nicely. They are famous for fish head curry which is excellent but you would need a big group of people or be really hungry to add that to the banana leaf curry combinations. Ask for an outdoors table, it really takes you back to old Singapore. Prices have crept up over the years and spice (heat) levels have also dropped: the expat effect no doubt. Still, the food is very clean and you will leave totally satiated. A must stop destination when in boring boring Singapore. 4

If you want to have some good Singaporean style South Indian food, then look no where else! The service was good. Decent food quality. Their chicken masala has always been my favourite. My only complain would be it's a little expensive. But that's the price you pay for Indian food these days
3
The food is iconic but the make sure patrons pay for it. The cost is definitely not cheap and the chef is a nut case. Nothing but tons and tons of chili and pepper till the natural taste of the food is completely lost!
5
Had the beriyani, gobi cauliflower, fried chicken and mango lassi. The rice was so nice and warm, chicken was crispy and cauliflower was so sweet. The aunty was so friendly and generous with the rice and curry portion.
3
Some of the buffet selection looks and tastes a little bit tired -after peak hours.
On the whole, was ok.
3
Not as good as expected. The facility is basic, nothing fancy. Food taste is average, limited choices. Service is average. With the facility given, price should be cheaper.
1
Very over rated place, food was pre cooked and chicken was completely dried by re cooking it. Place looks run down and dirty, waiter was very unfriendly and smelly. Would recommend to go to another foodcourt place, better quality and half the price.
5
Let it be lunch or dinner or when I have guest from Melbourne or India I give my relatives a treat at this restaurant. The waiters are very polite and they are always at my service. We have always fulfilling feeling. I have recommended this to many of my relatives and friends
4
I really liked it here. The place is a bit scruffy, but it is clean. The service is good enough. The food is awesome. I love a good curry and this is right up my street. Rive served on a banana leaf with your choice of 'gravy'. Choose the meats or veg you want to go with it and there's also a choice of breads. Mix-and-match. Had a good laugh with some friends here as the atmosphere is that of a canteen rather than a restaurant. If you're after fine dining, then this isn't the one. Prepare to get your fingers dirty and feel very satisfied with your meal

Decided to have curry for dinner on Saturday evening given the rainy season lately. Tried Foodpanda delivery as was lazy to get out of the house.Food was still warm and taste was delicious when delivered. Ordered the fish curry . Loved the taste . Spicy yet wanting to have more of the gravy . It complimented well with both Hot steam rice and garlic / plain nann. The curry Sotong was good too. Portion was good and enough for two of us. We loved the papadum it's so crispy and no after taste of fried oil like some places we tried .Looking forward to ordering again and eating in the comfort of our own home..this time will look forward to inviting friends over to share the yummy curry dishes!Worth a try

Have eaten here twice now, and is becoming one of my favourites when in Singapore. A great South Indian style curry fix - and a very nice place to sit and enjoy a cold beer with your food. It is housed in an old colonial style building with a verandah and fans for those who want a 'tropical' experience - which I did! The place is quite easy to find near the Botanic Gardens, but a bit of a walk to get to. The parking is quite crowded, and a taxi a better bet. Lots of taxis around for the return journey.The service is good and the food is excellent. All served on a banana leaf and very good value. This time we had the fish head curry, which was really very good - and nicely hot & spicy too. The rice and vegetable dishes are part of the meal and are served on the banana leaf - and topped up when you are running low. You just have to ask the waiter.Great value for money and the beer quite reasonable too for Singapore. I will be going back next time I am in Singapore, and can't wait to try that Fish head curry again
4
I am not a curry fan at all. But this place may have been the best food I ate for my entire trip in Singapore. Tucked away off the beaten path, it is what I would consider your hidden gem of dining. Very humble service and very accommodating. We sampled every item they had except the fish head soup and it was all great. Closest thing to of what I would believe to be authentic to the area. Must try

Recommended by a friend and no regrets
The fish head curry is very good.
But then you need to be craving fish head curry to go all the dempsey road
5
authentic south Indian food !great tandoori chicken and curry fish head.located in the heart of Dempsey hill
4
we were recommended this restaurant by one of the staff in our hotel and we were pleased we went .The food was delicious and the staff very friendly i would recommend the tandoori pomfret
5
Ok- this place is probably a local secret- it is NOT a 5 star cuisine dining restaurant- its looks hide what you will get and that is amazing real no frills Indian food.There are definitely no frills here but it's the best Indian I have ever eaten!There are no plates and to my knowledge no menu that I saw either.This ancient converted mess hall has tables on which knives forks and square cut palm leaves are laid.As soon as your settled in the food begins, big pots are brought around and ladled onto your palm leaf by the staff most of whom have worked here for 10+ years. Can't say there was anything we didn't like, the gravy for the rice does hold a punch though.Strongly recommend however the cauliflower dish, tikka prawns (which are enormous) chicken tikka and lamb dish. I tell you this as there is so much offered to you that you may have eyes bigger than your belly so you can save room for these when you say yes to all on offer!So excellent food at a good price without all the frills!Go enjoy but don't tell everyone
4
Don't expect fancy table cloths and fine dining but just a family run restaurant that has been serving up authentic Indian cuisine. The late Mr Veerasamy arrived in Singapore in 1950 and in 1963 started a road side stall before opening his Samy's Curry in 1970 on Pearl's Hill. 5 years later he moved to Dempsey Road and the rest is history. The restaurant is very popular and adviseable to book especially if you want to be seated in the air-conditioned room. Otherwise make sure you're under one of the many ceiling fans
4
This is one of the best Indian food I have tasted in Singapore. We ordered fish head curry, fried cauliflower, fried ladies finger, masala chicken and squid. All of the dishes are delicious. One down side is probably the lack of hygiene at the place - dirt on the leaves where food was served on
4
I went to Samy's with some business colleagues on a Wednesday evening - the fish head curry was delicious with a good kick of heat, and I particularly enjoyed the squid. Not the best restrooms in the world, but the food more than made up for it
3
We were promised a stomping hot curry in a tropical island setting. AJ & I were picked up from T3 Changi in Mercedes GL250 4wd. Our friend H drove us to Dempsey in german stealth metal coach. The contrast on stepping into the control chaos of Samy's curry was monsoonal. Heaps of crowded tables laden with banana leaf plates heaped with rice & curry. We had chicken masala with white rice. Fish patties and lovely fish curry sauce. Washed down with Samy's lime juice. AJ from India had extra. A taste different from India's. The papadums were wafers of South Asia in concentrate. We saw lawyers in black & white enjoying the fish head. Maybe another time as we were discussing astrological economics with H. So couldn't let our senses be clouded by spice and chilly
5
To taste the food and lick your fingers through the rice and curry is just heavenly!You have a choice ... To be adventurous and genuine by using your hands , or to be less brave and stick with your cutlery . I chose the former ....now think about thoseDelicious crabs ......you will have to use your hands , right?There 's an array of choice ......meat , seafood and vegetarian. The curry itself is so delicious and so goes for the rest of the menu. The poppadums, the lentils and beans and fish head curry and curried chicken pieces are so delicious !The drive there is tricky so you will need a local guide or a local friend to take you there.Worth the drive

We had lunch for 27 persons at Samy’s Curry at Block 25, Dempsey Road, Singapore. This restaurant has been around at this location for over 2 decades. It was started by Mr. Veerasamy in the 1950’s at Tank Road, moved to Pears Hill for some years, and finally settled at Dempsey Road in the early 1980’s. In 1982 Mr.Veerasamy’s son Mr.Maheyndran took over the restaurant which has become a popular place among locals and tourists alike for Southern Indian Cuisine.  The Restaurant is set in one of the old colonial buildings on Dempsey Hill, once the Ministry of Home Defence, and is not difficult to find, nor is it too far to walk in from the main road. Practically all the taxi drivers here know how to get you there. The ambience is a simple coffee style eatery with some wall decorations. There’s a main non-air-conditioned hall with sitting around the perimeter, and an air-conditioned room.   The cooked food is displayed behind glass cases. Portions are taken from here and served. Amongst our favourites are the Fish Head curry, Masala Chicken, Curry Mutton, Curry Squid. There’s Curry Crabs, Curry Fish and Curry Prawns if you fancy paying more. Two types of vegetables are cooked each day, and the Pomfret Tandoori on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. The latter is delicious but also expensive-as pomfret fish are. When you sit down, a banana leaf is placed as a plate before you, and either plain steamed white or briyani rice is served, depending on your selection. Both come with their two vegetables of the day which usually is a blob of potato salad and some other vegetable like dhal. They also serve Papadums with the meal. Chutney, pickles or mint sauce isn’t available. A list of soft drinks is on the menu, as is coffee and teas, a selection of beers, and of red and white wines. However, I think curry is best eaten with cold beer. Their iced lime juice drink, and hot Masala Tea are highly popular.  We found the food delicious as always, pretty consistent in quality and flavour. Some of the curry dishes can be pretty ‘chili’ hot. So ask about this if you cannot consume food that’s too spicy. The service is attentive, polite and fast. The waiters are pretty accommodative. There’s ample parking if you drive. Access from the back is possible for wheel chairs, plus some muscle power. Toilets are on the left side of the building as you face the restaurant. Dress: casual. No WiFi available. Credit cards taken. The restaurant is closed on Tuesdays. Lunch is from 11 am to 3 pm and Dinner from 6 pm to 10pm.  Address: Samy’s Curry Restaurant Pte. Ltd. Blk 25 Dempsey Road, Singapore 249670.  Tel:6472 2080

Three adults and 4 kids 5 to 13 years. Authentic restaurant in great setting - highly recommended to seek it out. Very super fast service. I recommend order a few different dishes and some naan and sharing with others. Mango lassi 10/10!
2
Highly overpriced indian food. All Pre-cooked, and rather small servings. Many other places offer better quality and more value for money.
5
A place that our family goes to every time we are back in Singapore. Default order is Pomfret fry, mutton fry, Bandung, Teh Alia and rice. :)
5
We always make a point of eating here whenever we are in Singapore. The best Indian food we've had in a very relaxed, informal setting. We'll be back, again!
3
We've been recommended this place for a good Indian. It was ok but we were not impressed by what we had, or let's say it this way, we had much better elsewhere. We saw hanging on the wall pictures with the word Tamil. So probably this is tamil cuisine that we are not used to taste. We are more often exposed to North Indian cuisine. Anyhow, we were not huge fans like others on TA. After all it's a question of taste
5
Great food, spicy and hearty. Staff are attentive and friendly. Its difficult to go to Dempsey Hill & choose to dine at a different resturant other than Samy's Curry, especially since Indian food is probably my favourite!The mutton is to die for and they are obviously doing something right with their mutton dishes! Accompany your food with a cold glass of lime juice and you're enroute to food coma by the end of your meal
4
This veritable curry house has been serving up Masala flower crabs and fish head curry at the foot of Dempsey hill for many a year and predates most if not all of the more recent restaurants and bars here. If you like your fish head curry spicy this is the place to go. Food served on banana leaf, free flow rice and dhal all served at a reasonable price
5
If you want up-market, romantic, exotic, or a range of wine with your Indian food, this place is not for you. If you want a really interesting experience, with as basic and good as it gets Singapore Indian food, then head to Samy's. Interesting location, near the city central areas, and with a few other local-looking places in the same complex. Food served on banana leaves. You have to feel like a local if you are to enjoy this, and if you do enjoy it, you will be feeling like a local.Try it. You won't be disappointed.To rate Samy's as excellent, I have to qualify that it is not Michelin Star, nor even as fine as Singapore's more upmarket Indian restaurants. It is just damn good for what it is - the real thing
4
A must try if you are a foodie and loves spicy Indian food. The food is absolutely hot, spicy and delicious Try the fish head curry, served boiling hot(we could see it bubbling in the pot that was served!!!), with rice. Also try the mysore mutton fry. Team the food with awesome friends for company - you have a winning combo..
4
Had my Indian Curry fixed today.Ordered :- curry fish head ; ordered as it's recommended on the review and on menu; it's bit watery lacking in curry spiced flavor.- masala chicken ; GREAT fast in contrary-will order again on my next visit.- gobi65 (fried cautiflower in batter)- Kashmiri naan- Briyani rice ; free flow alongside either chicken or fish curry gravy; the fish gravy on this case is thick and flavorful! - Plain and mango lassiWill repeat visit again, good ambience and food for Indian curry lovers
4
The dishes here are served on a banana leaf which makes it a real and rustic feel when you eat. The food tasted fantastic and always good to share it with friends. I was not disappointed!!
4
This famous place has been around for 50 years. The biryani and white rice are great to soak up the delicious curries here.
Highly recommend.
5
Had Sunday lunch here. Hugh portions of food. Unlimited papadum to soak up all the wonderful curries. The lime juice which came in big cups were great to wash all the rich food down.
4
Family run business. Free flow of rice (choice of bryani or white rice) and papadams (indian crackers)
5
Absolutely love the Indian food here. Has the best indian food in the whole wide world in my humble opinion. Service and courtesy of staff can be greatly improve though....
5
Singapore has many great Indian eateries But there's something about samys that I truly love. I come back at least once a year (I don't live in Singapore). For me It epitomises the Indian food experience.... the banana leaf the endless serves of rice, dal and gravy delicious generous fun and reasonable ... Love this place
5
What a place. One of the oldest fish head curry restaurants out of little India. Set in old demsey - the place has a old charm to it. Set on long communal tables, food is served in banana leave and you have rice and vegetables placed on it before you make your order of the many many types of curries.I love they lamb curry and fish curry the best
4
We visited Samy's on a stopover to Singapore recently as we wanted to sample the fish-head curry for which the restaurant is famous. As well as this we the paneer cheese with veg, the assorted naan breads and fried pomfret. All was consumed on an environmentally sustainable setting of a banana leaf! Highly recommended
5
Samy's Curry is the go to place for fantastic curry and rice. Our favourite is Fish Head Curry and the Fried Fish. It is situated in Dempsey Hill, which has a great feel to it as an area. But this is not a posh restaurant, it is a hybrid of restaurant and food court environment. You will never see this place empty. And what will always amuse and excite you is eating on the fresh banana leaf. If you don't have a palette for spicy, no problem go try the curry with plain yoghurt on the side. It is undoubtedly one of the best eats. You always come home in a food coma
4
Fish head curry at this place is absolutely delicious. The serving size is very generous - I ordered a small one and it was definitely enough for 2 people to share (perhaps with a couple extra sides), medium and large sizes must be huge. Chicken tandoori wasn't that great though, deep fried and very dry.Rice and side veggies are served on a banana leaf which makes a cool experience. Overall vibe is very laid back and simple and there are a lot of local Indian families and groups of friends dining here which is usually a sign of an authentic food :)
4
Relaxing low key basic place but the food and atmosphere were great. The Indian food is authentic and cheap.
5
this is such a nice chill place for weekend. in dempsey in old barracks house. the food is good like masala chicken, egg roe and curry fish head. don't expect full service though.
5
Always a Favourite with the home close by. Ordered the chicken Marsala and fish cutlet and never fails to deliver a satisfying meal
3
I think I have been frequenting Samy's at Dempsey's for about 20 years. Standards have slid - I think the quality has been rather inconsistent, quantity shrinking and bill enlarging. The good thing about Samy's is probably the parking - it's free and rather accessible.
4
A very traditional Indian restaurant where you can eat with fingers also you have no plate. Your plate is a banana leaf. Yummy food and a great experience . Just be careful if you use fingers to eat it will be hard to take the stain of curry of your fingers nails! The place has no luxury but food is beautiful
3
Samy's Curry was very crowded for a weekday lunch but despite the crowd, their staff were very prompt and patient in their service. In terms of the food, they are a tad too spicy but very flavourful and nice. The curry fish head was soft and complemented well with the naan
5
The restaurant is as basic as it can get much like the Mumbai cafes. They have a air conditioned place also but the real fun is eating under the fanServed on banana leaf is a great meal consisting of rice dal vegetables curry and lot of specialities like chicken , crab , lobster , dry lamb which can be chosen. Qty is unlimited I guess because they serve you with remarkable alacrity. Fish head curry with vegetables is a must try. Curries can be hot and difficult to handle , order a lot of curd and buttermilk Not to be missed Singapore is a great place for food and sans curry is outstanding . Much better than many Indian restaurants but very different
5
My wife and I have been coming to Samys since the early 80's when it was a self service outlet selling great fish head curry and curry squid.We have just spent another great evening with friends sitting on the verandah having our old favourites the difference being that since the 80's they:* have now replaced self service with very nice waiters service* have now added cold beer and wine to their menuAll of which gives you an even better food experience compared to the 80's A restaurant which in no way tries to be pretentious but will satisfy your craving for an excellent curry
4
Samy’s Curry is located off Orchard Road……..and its an traditional ‘banana leaf’ restaurant that serves basic and very tasty food. The fish head curry is always excellent although a bit of acquired taste and they obviously do all the usual tikka and biryani dishes, with the mutton curry a winner.Its not top-end dinning, but the prices are reasonable, the ambience fun, basic and clean.What else do you need if you’re after good food, healthy vegetarian options and no dinner plates
4
One of the greatest things to grace Singapore since ever has been the array of excellent food on offer. Simply put, it's a foodie's wonderland in every way possible. Worst thing that can happen to you in this tiny city state is that you get a mediocre meal. Stay right away from chain stores and you're pretty much guaranteed to get something delicious and flavorful every single time.If there's one thing about Singapore that I think works well, it's that they love their food. So much so that anywhere you can get it, if you follow the lines of locals, you know they've got it good.What you get here at Samy's is southern Indian cooking. There's a reason they've been here 50 years, because in Singapore if they don't like your food, you're outta business real fast. Fish head curry was the major highlight of the evening, as well as lovely ensembles such as sambal prawn, mysore mutton, black squid along with your complimentary items like biryani and dahl all make for one intensely awesome meal at any time of day. Wash that down with lime juice (a Singapore staple) or Tiger beer and you simply can't do much better.Price wise, it markets itself as cheap food, but I found that wasn't so when compared with hawker centres and food courts alike. I would say it's around medium range pricing but definitely worth every cent.The location of the place is not so easy to find and you'll have a hell of a hard time getting outta there, too. It's located on Dempsey Hill, so you're best to get a cab there. Buses run along the main road down the bottom but I had absolutely no idea where we were going on those, so we opted to walk to the subway instead. I would suggest you plan your way outta there because walking to the subway in that stifling humidity is kinda awful and you'll more than likely stink like you've been rolling around in sheep guts by the time you get inside. So, plan your way out via the correct bus route and you'll be absolutely fine.In all, this place is great and now a must do every time I visit Singapore. You should make it the same, also
5
One of the major specialisation of Singapore is Fish head curry and no body does it better than this place.Wonderful experience!
5
One of the oldest and mist established Indian authentic restaurant in Singapore!
Been coming here since 16 years and it's a must place to visit if you are in town.
4
Came here today. Very good Indian curry house (banana leaves style - no plates) very good value. Try the mutton curry and skip the fish head (pricy and lamely spiced).
5
Consistently good and recommend this for a casual, spicy dining experience. My personal favourites are the dry lamb curry (spicy!) and butter chicken. You will leave very full so pace yourself when ordering!
5
Had heard that this was a not to be missed in Singapore. The concierge also spoke very highly of it. This delectable fare in Dempsey Hill won't disappoint. The place fills up with a lot of young couples and families but worth the wait. If you can get a table outside under a fan. The food is served on banana leaves which somehow perks up the taste
1
We have eaten here a few times in the past and have had reasonable curries served in a quaint restaurantHowever this visit was dreadful. The chicken tikka was cold deep fried dried out and hideous. Never had a worse curry!The daal was watered down with huge chunks of tasteless vegetable maybe courgette? Yogurt with cucumber was similarly without taste and watered downPrevious visits we were served a variety of sides, this time just the twoVery disappointing deterioration of a fun place to eat. Won't be returning again
4
Went to Dempsey for Lunch. Service was good with smile. Food was fresh and not that expensive. They give rice (white or biryani) with lenthil and a veggie to start with then you choose your dish on top. Fish curry was very good, very fresh..What i didnt link was the waiter who took our order was more like a salesman, tried to sell me fish head curry even though i was the one non-vegetarian member in the group.A decent chicken, seafood and fish variety was on offer, place is clean and airy.Decent place
5
The food here is incredible. The location is beautiful, nestled in the rainforest ~ sitting outside we could see the trees and birds. Was lovely.For $3, you get plain rice and vegetables curries free flow. You can then add meat dishes. I would possibly suggest ordering less meat dishes and eating more vegetable curries. It's delicious!! It's semi expensive for Singapore, but completely worth it!The mutton curry was delicious; the Masala chicken was also great.
5
A reservation was made for about 15 colleagues for a weekday dinner. Given a choice of outdoor / indoor / or aircondition for dinner dining. (Probably because we were early) Layout & deco was rather simple ... however the flexibility of food choices (between spicy and not spicy choices) for a few colleagues / friendliness of staff and quality of food served was top notched. Getting there by public transport ... can be a little inconvenient though ..
1
Tough the food was ok, there was a very rude elderly lady, that threw a rude gesture when I didn't want any gravy on my food. Somehow, she walked by and made another comment a few minutes later. I captured it and translated in to English. It said "don't know how to eat banana leaf, don't eat!". We'll.. I won't return, most definitely
5
Authentic atmosphere, jawdroppingly tasty lamb and butter chicken and naan! Drinks arrived before the waiter even left the table! This place really delivered a memorable experience.
5
We have been several times to this place and never get surprised with the consistently good quality food served. My favourites have always been the fish cutlet, chicken tikka and the meals with the chicken and fish curry along with the lentil curry and the rasam( a kind of muliigatawny soup), as also finishing off with the yoghurt to cool things down a bit. Of course, it helps to have a Tiger Beer as well. The fish cutlet was superb and as was the chicken tikka. The meat was quite succulent and not that spicy at all, just right. The service was as always personalised and excellent. I have taken many of my overseas friends over there through the years and never been disappointed. Highly recommended for authentic Tamil curry
4
We hit this place with a group of customers last night and had a very nice and tasty time. When you roll into the area your not sure if your going to dinner or dropping your car off for body work. It's in the middle of a automobile repair shop district. To start we tee'd off with some Tiger beer and one of the quests byo'd some nice red wine.The steak appetizer, wings, sate and other family style foods came out quickly and hot. The big round wheel in the middle of the table was customary and it was super interactive. Food was very tasty, beer cold and service was great.Must have a reservation and tables are round and hold up to 8 people.Fun, tasty and local flair.
4
On our recent visit to Singapore, a close friend recommended we try the fish head curry at Samy's. Born and bred Sri Lankan, we wondered what the fuss was about. First impression was the location, a very humble and unassuming location at Dempsey Road. We sat outdoors. The service was very attentive and the owner himself recommended some dishes which were all excellent and filling. All the seafood dishes were fantastic as were the mutton and Masala Chicken. The lime juice was fantastic in cooling us all down after a filling meal
4
The restaurant itself is unpretentious... No frills just good old fashion banana leaf joint. We had the curry fish head, fish cutlets, butter chicken & Gobi 65. All were delicious. Do order the mint chutney & eat it with anything and everything (they served it with any tandoori dish)... The best so far, even better than those we had in Mumbai, India
4
Being British, the Indian curry is a staple food at home, so imagine my pleasure when I was taken to a very good Indian restaurant in Singapore ! Set in among the trees this busy, vibrant food court is certainly a good place to find all types of cuisine. We sat on the veranda and ate our food from banana leaves as everyone did. We tried the fish curry (very good) the mutton curry (very good) and the chicken curry (very good). The spices are fresh and full of flavour and the dishes are not too spicy, so OK for less adventurous Europeans ! Highly recommended for both location, food and service
5
We were lucky enough to experience this place on a visit to Tanglin Village as we both love Indian cuisine and the food was great! It is not a posh place by any means but don't be put off by the rather basic looking interior. The food is served on palm leaves rather than plates and was all absolutely delicious! The service was good too. We left here feeling happy!
5
I've been here several times and each time the quality remains consistently delicious and you can't help but to eat more than you should. The fish head curry is to-die-for and so are the other dishes. This is a great place to bring out-of-town guests to sample some lovely indian food.
4
We brought our birthday friend for a lunch treat today. Overall good meal. We love the gobi, masala chicken and fish head curry. Masala tea not good enough - need more spices. Service very good. Waiter kept on checking on us if we have enough food and if we want more rice. Keep it up, guys!
4
It's simply the best southern Indian food served in the idyllic environment at Dempsey Hill. Served on banana leaf, it's authentic and you can feel the explosion of many spices coming together.The venue itself is serene and one could explore after a good meal. There are art and handicraft shops in the area too to walk off some calories after a sumptuous meal.Parking is readily available and the best part is the greenery available to cool down the place from the tropical heat.If you're are curry and spice lover, go give yourself a treat
5
You will leave the restaurant a happier, full,and satisfied being.. I have to say I had the best banana leaf meal there
4
If you really like fish-head curry and don't mind to use your hand. This is a great place for that. Steam rice and fish head curry is amazing. Their tiger prawn is amazing. For is really great here.
5
Sit down at Samy's and you are immediately surrounded by waiters eager to place food on your banana leaf. A very unique dining experience in Singapore... don't pass it up.
5
A nice south Indian food, both Veg and Non Veg, good location and excellent food, very reasonable price, excellent service. Will definitely go back again.
5
Took 2 of my friends to Samy's. From the 'plates' - banana leaves, delicious curry, fish, chicken, shrimp, their own special lime drink - excellent. A reservation during peak times is important. Ask to be on the outside veranda.
4
Never expect this humble restaurant will provide us the wonderful aroma and genuine taste of Fish Curry. The mutton was great too and the portion are generous. If you can eat more than 1.5 dinner plate and love curry? This is really a "thumb-ups" place! Well done

@TheKuoKnowThe word "institition" is much overused when describing restaurants that have simply been around for a long time.But Samy's at Dempsey, which has been around for over half a decade, is inching ever closer to becoming a true Singapore eating institution.Diners go to Samy's to appreciate the kitchen's years of experience in preparing some of the best North and South Indian curries I have had. The restaurant might look kind of rough and ready in appearance. But there is nothing slap-dash about the flavours.If you are dining alone, an entire Fish Head Curry, which is one of Samy's specialities, might be a little overwhelming. But its simple Fish Curry, which is sold by the portion, is probably good enough to let you sample the chef's unparalleled skills at handling seafood.The Mutton Mysore and Chicken Masala are equally good. I also like the Chicken Liver Curry. But try to make sure you sit under one of the many fans that circle overhead. The liberal use of chillies can be a little mind-blowing.Rice, side vegetable and popadoms are bottomless, which is great news for those with a healthy appetite. I find that white rice complements the meal better than basmati rice, which is also available.Samy's is a credit to Singapore cooking. There might be cheaper alternatives on the backstreets of Little India. But few can match Samy's charm. It is something special

Samy's at Dempsey Hill is a throwback to the 50's. The place has been modernised, without changing or discarding any of the old-time elements. The place is matched by the waiters, many of whom are old (but efficient) as well as the traditional menu, which would not have been out of place in the 60's- except for the new-fangled North Indian and Chinese stuff, best to be avoided. There is generous seating inside and in the veranda outside, to be enjoyed in good weather. The service is quick, the rates are very wallet-friendly. And the food ! It is worth coming all the way again and again. The fish head curry, the mutton , most anything is excellent, of generous proportions and fresh. And, the taste is kept the same for decades- original Tamil food, no compromises. What more to ask ? The best thing about the place is that they have resisted going 'fine-dining' or 'fusion'. Kept to the basics. That works wonderfully

A friend and I came out based on a food blog saying this was the best meal he had in Singapore. We ordered the small fish head curry tandoori chicken and nan. It filled us both up and was a delicious meal. Would definitely recommend this place and worth the money. We were the only tourist in there.
5
Great food, friendly staff, not so hard on the pocket, restaurant is in a nice tranquil location, what more can you ask for. They have indoor without AC, indoor with AC and outdoor seating, i prefer indoor with AC as its more comfortable for my baby. Would choose this over Banana Leaf anytime
4
The dining experience cosists of fragrant rice (white or saffron), dhal, assorted veggies, choice of meat (chicken or fish) - while seated at the alfresco area watching the ever-polite servers keeping themselves busy. Just like in the old days.
5
Samy's always the best after an over indulgent evening. The right flavours of the rice and curry and excellent mutton and chicken and the prawns. Been going back for years.
5
One of the best Indian meals ever. Seriously a must!
Dont judge the experience from the building this is excellent and worth the time to enjoy. The food is brillant and authentic in every way. The Fish head curry is highly recommended
4
if you are in Singapore and craving for South Indian food, Samys curryif the place you are looking for. Their fish head curry is a must try.
4
Went for dinner. Would have been happy with only the standard dhal and veg curry, but the fish head curry and dry mutton and chicken curry were irresistible. A fine evening out in air conditioned comfort.
4
We had the banana leaf set, the smallest fish head curry they had, tandoori chicken, fried cauliflower and some mutton dish. We would have been happy with just the rice and fish head curry as everything else was mediocre. Papadams were good and they are happy to give you seconds if you ask. In fact they would give you more than seconds on the rice and banana leaf set condiments if you ask. 5 non-alcoholic drinks and all the above for over SGD80. I'm still thinking of the curry fish head.
4
Went with a group of friends for lunch at Samy's. Dempsey area is close to town and parking is free (really rare in Singapore these days)! Despite being a Monday, the restaurant was 80 percent full when we arrived at 12:45pm. It was a hot afternoon and the intelligent staff suggested seating us in the air-conditioned area. Fiery curry on a hot, humid afternoon in comfortable air-conditioning is the way to go for me. The fish head curry is always good and we were not disappointed. Tried the fried chicken for the first time and was gladly surprised. It went really well with the other curried dishes and rice. The service was very, very good. Prices are still affordable, considering the location, quality and service we received. Be back there soon
3
Went there with a group of friends and ordered the fish head, prawns, mutton masala, squid, cauliflower and butter chicken.The service was extremely helpful and courteous considering there were 15 of us and we kept changing our minds.Apart from the mutton masala the food was quite averag
3
I've been to Samy's many times over the years since 1997. The location (in Dempsey Road) hasn't changed, but the surroundings, ambience etc have have. It's just not as much fun as the old days.Today's Samy's is much more expensive, and the helpings a bit on the mean side. The food just doesn't seem as tasty. If you must go then go in the evening and get a table on the terrace out front. That bit hasn't changed much atmosphere wise. Inside the old mess hall (this used to be part of a British army barracks back in the day) is brighter and cleaner than it used to be, and they now have an air-conditioned dining room at the back of the building (which is probably a good idea at lunchtime).Highlights are still the dry mutton curry (very spicy) and the curried king-sized banana prawns. In the old days they didn't sell beer (which was catered for by the Civil Service Sports club that was next door - now a branch of the Long Beach Seafood chain), but today they do. It's not as cheap as it used to be either. A feed that cost $30 a head probably now sits the wrong side of $60 plus beer. You can probably get a better-value banana leaf curry experience somewhere else in Singapore. Service is just about average for Singapore, and might be considered slow or inattentive by American standards
5
We went as a family of four and enjoyed the food throughly. We ordered the masala chicken, mysore mutton, fish head curry and biryani rice.The food is served with cabbage curry and cucumber raita in a banana leaf, which is like a coolant for the spicy and tasty curry's. You can ask for a helping of vegetarian sambar, chicken rasam and chicken/fish gravy plus unlimited papadams with the biryani rice. The gravy is spicy, oily, tangy and leaves you feeling heavy. The rasam is super spicy and goes well with white rice and papadam. The food is delicious and you will feel satiated after this heavy meal. Feel as a family of four we could have done with two meat orders and one vegetable dish. We topped this food with a scoop of Strawberry Surprise New Zealand ice cream to cool all spices and flavours inside our stomach after this meail. Fantastic place with warm and friendly staff....nice place to go.Only think i miss after such a good Indian meal is a Paan
4
Been here a couple of times.
Seafood and non veg items are amazing! Not so impressed with the veg items!
Would suggest going there for lunch as it is less crowded.
5
Great spot. Food comes out quickly. Authentic currys and served on the banana leaf. Cold beers and great service. Will certainly be back again.
5
Chaeap, authentic, fast, its on a banana, leaf, wide choice, a bit hard to find- an original that has been going for years....worth finding.
5
Not the easiest place to find if you're a tourist but well worth the trip. Best place in Singapore to eat curry off a banana leaf!
4
Have now eaten here on 3-4 occasions and keep requesting that we go back when in the City visiting relatives. The place has a unique atmosphere where you sit at a long table and a variety of dishes are brought round and you choose which ones you wish to have. Alternatively you can go the counter and choose a number of dishes which are brought to the table to share.All is served on large banana leaves to add to the experience!Will hopefully return on a future visit to the area.
4
Crazy busy and amazing food. Decor is basic, staff are efficent and helpful. Food is served on a banana leaf and eating with your hands is okay if that is what you prefer. Different to what i am used to but definitely one to do while in Singapore
5
Samy's is a winderful restaurant. The food is simple yet authentic and the atmosphere is truly amazing. The meat is halal and the staff extremely attentive and helpful. The curry's are great and full of flavour and very reasonable. A must try if you're visiting Singapore
4
Visited Samy's at the beginning of November and it was packed to capacity. It appears that no day or season deters folk from this venue. The restaurant is located at Dempsey Hill, at the far end. It is your typical South Indian atmosphere and ambiance...which has an unique charm of its own. We tried the biriyani rice with mutton, cuttlefish, fried fish and chicken. All were fantastic. Possibly even better than what you find in Chennai or Kerala. All dishes are served on a banana leaf, most typical with places such as Muthu Curry House etc.Highly recommended to all that love a rice n curry with flavor in plentiful. The service is ultra fast and the stewards are all very helpful. Most importantly, the rice is served on an unlimited basis. I am definitely a return customer.
3
Some 40 years in business, yes it is fun, your plate is actually a banana leaf, menu is short, which means it's fresh and home made, but overall I found the chisken very greasy and the biryani rice really plain.Not mentionning that I doubt hygiene is up to standard, its closer to street food than to actual restaurant. Will not go back
4
This is one of the oldest Indian curry resturant in Singapore, nested in the green and lush Demsey Hill togather with many other popular restaurants and pubs. The resturant could accommodate a few hundreds guests, with both air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned areas. All the dishes here from Chicken, beef, mutton, fish-head and vegetables are pre cooked and displayed for your choice. I would recommend you try their fish head curry S$21, tandoori Chicken $6.50 per piece, cauliflower $6 and special vegetable $8. Steamed rice at $3 per head comes with unlimited and free vegetables and papdum. All food are served on banana leaves, very authentic and delicious! Yes and no 10% service charge here
4
Samy's Curry is well known in Singapore for their hot Massala Chicken. Though their restaurant is not furnished, they are packed most day
4
If you like Indian food and you are in a hurry, this is a place to go. the place can get busy and parking at weekends can be quite challenging. Try the chicken curry and fish head curry with local beer.
5
This was a wonderful dining experience! Great value for money, loved the curries on the banana leaf. Staff were friendly and efficient. Would definitely return!
4
keep it simple and rather cheap, nice surrounding, Dempsey Hill, tasty food, noisy place, family friendly
5
Great service. Great food. Inviting atmosphere. Not expensive. Im going back. And asking for a tee shirt hahaha.

One of my favorite place to go for fish-head curry. There are varied style of cooking fish-head curry in Singapore; spicy Assam based of the Nasi Pandan, the fruity sweet sour Chinese version, and off the Indian herds and spices version. I like Samy's version to that of those in the Race Course Road/ Serangoon (Little India) for its aroma and slightly lighter gravy with a tumeric based. It's served with egg plant and okra and tomato as part of the curry. The potato patty, fried chicken liver/gizzards are some of the side dishes that I love. The rice is served directly onto a piece of banana leaf with two standard vegetable curry side dishes and Papadum. If you are not too adventurous for fish-head curry, there are always the usual masala prawn or crabs, butter chicken, black squid, chicken tikka to name a few. They also serve briyani rice or naan topped with garlic, butter, or cheese. I ordered the butter and garlic naan to go with my curry instead of rice.The restaurant is set in the disused British colonial style Army camp site along Holland Road opposite to the Singapore Botanical Gardens. It is quite visible from the main road and within 5min walking distance from the bus stop. I love digging my hands into the curry by the veranda instead of the main dinning hall. Another taste of the local experience
4
Since my first visit to Samy's Curry way back in 1990, I had the immense pleasure of enjoying their famous delicious Fish Head Curry.And I have been enjoying this with my family and business associates, on any occasion: work and pleasure.Very seldom one can get the same recipe, the familiar taste for such a long period. This can only be proven when you keep coming back to this heritage place as I have done. The combination of the excuisite Indian food, the colonial ambience, and the flora around makes every visit just a precedence to come back for the next delightful visit
4
Situated in the old Army Barracks in the Tanglin Village close to Orchard Rd. Not a posh place but lovely authentic Indian food, famous for fish head curry and chicken masala. When you have finished your meal you can look around the lovely antique shops next to the restaurant. Family friendly. 3 of us had lunch there for 70 SGD
4
Everything is very basic, absolutely no frills but by gum the food tastes good. Delicious curry, perfect rice, cooling cucumber and all ladeled out with no ceremony whatsoever. All washed down with a jug or two of beer. Best curry for a long time. Wish there was something like this nearer home. Very casual, very relaxed and highly recommended
4
This is a shop tucked in a corner of Dempsey...which used to house the Colonial army barracks.The setting is lush and green but the aroma wafting from the restaurant took center stage.Definitely order the Curried Crab and Mutton Paretel.Rice is served on a banana leaf and the veg of the day is ladled out in perfect little portions.Scoop a portion of chicken, some veg and fish...make a little parcel with the rice and enjoy.The crab ...well have it on its own!Try the fresh lime juice and the fresh coconut.Great to start and finish the meal
5
This place is an institution. Love to come here and eat off the banana leaf. The tandoori chicken and cauliflower are my favourites, fresh coconut, kingfisher beer, garlic nan.
3
I'm an Indian and a good critique at Indian food. Honestly, for all I heard and read about this place... its nothing fantastic at all. Went on a Friday evening, place was crowded. Food was not hot. Taste average. That's my verdict.
5
Been quite some time we have not eaten Indian food. Here we are...Banana leaves with the choice of your rice, white or briyani (colored rice). The curry is fantastic, palak paneer & butter chicken are tasty as usual. A place for casual meal. Come here in shorts, T shirt & slippers.Friendly waiter where address us as brother& sister. Friendly waiter where address us as
5
Samys is a family favourite, especially for our teenager. I guess there’s something about eating off a banana leaf. And also the food comes quickly & is plentiful, which is also important when dealing with a teenager (cheap too)! You just show up, go with the waiter to the counter inside, point out your selections, and out they come. Along with a lot of rice, sauce and dal. I have not had anything bad there, and the spicy jumbo prawns and the cauliflower are particular favourites. It is nothing fancy, just tasty, inexpensive and fun. And also nice to explore Dempsey Hill a bit while you’re there.
5
I just could not believe how much of a great expense we had with the food at this restaurant or the super friendly staff we found there. First of all, they do not serve food on plates. they serve them in a traditional indian way on a banana leaf which was also a nice thing to try.I have tried indian food in many many places around the world but this restaurant was with no hesitation the best of them all.The staff are very humble and friendly they even make you feel they are one family and you are their house guest
4
Samy's curry is a must visit place for Indians and non-Indians alike. The restaurant has retained its old Singapore charm over the years. Centrally located opposite the Singapore Botanical Gardens (A UNESCO World Heritage Site), Samys offers traditional Indian dishes on the banana leaf.Be sure to try the Mysore Mutton, Chicken Tikka, and variety of fish. The popular drink is lime juice, although you have beer, cold coconut water, etc.If you are ordering rice, be sure to have their free serving of papadams and vegetables. The vegetables are sometimes more if not equally as delicious as their popular dishes

It was a Sunday morning when my wife and I were craving for fine South Indian cuisine we missed for almost two years, so we decided to bring along our maid for a lunch at Samy’s Curry Restaurant in Dempsey Road where it is popular among the locals and tourists alike. The restaurant serves a variety of Indian food and is more like a canteen with big ceiling fans and a 80s colonial setting surrounded by serene and beautiful greenery which would probably best describe the ambiance. This non air-conditioned eating place provides a rather lovely environment for the spicy meal. It is a rather great eatery to bring friends, family and even overseas guests who love good piquant food.When we stepped in and sat down, one of the waiters inevitably placed banana leaves in front of us as our plates and we chose white rice instead of fragrant biryani. Next the vegetable curry and dhal came spontaneously along with the white rice on the banana leaf. It has been said that banana-leaf meal tastes better than it is on a plate. Did the banana leaf really add a certain authenticity and light fragrance to our meal? Bluntly speaking, we did not know! Some people even believed that the food on the banana leaf would taste even better when eaten with their bare hands. Till now, we could not figure out the rationale for such a belief let alone any proven truth for it. Well, we just have to get over the psychological bearer posed by any unfounded belief.As usual, we made our way to a food display counter at the corner of the restaurant to choose our curries and petite portions of our favourite dishes for three of us. We ordered a small dish of curry mutton ($10), black squid ($9), tandoori chicken ($6.50), 4 fish cutlets ($8.40) and 2 big lime juice ($6.40). Of course, the white rice with vegetables for three persons ($9) is on unlimited replenishment. Though curry fish head is one of their signature dishes, we kept reminding ourselves not to order any curry fish head this time. My favourite dish was curry fish head but not anymore. I would deal with the curry fish head last so that I would be able to hold my appetite till the end.There are so many Indian restaurants not having a traditional banana leaf meal anymore. The reason could either be because they are no longer popular or the world is running out of banana leaves. The curry mutton, black squid, tandoori chicken and fish cutlets were merely average, but the standouts were the simple occasional dhal and vegetable curry which came with the white rice. They were rich, creamy and so delicious on their own that we could even eat them all up without any other side dishes. We really got an exotic flavour! The curry mutton turned out to be soft and luscious with reasonably delectable curry flavours. The black squid, however, tasted a little brackish but just tender to the bite. The tandoori chicken was tender, freshy and tasty. The fish cutlet was more like a fish ball with its minced fish meat fried soft with a light crisp. Unfortunately, with just three dining companions among ourselves, it was not worth going for more. We ended our meal with a lovely refreshing lime juice to cool ourselves down. Our maid always has a habit of bringing a small bottle of mineral water from home for quenching her thirst.Now, the curry fish head which we refused to ever try again. I recalled about two years ago, one of the waiters recommended curry fish head for four of us, who were colleagues from the same office. In addition to the large dish of curry fish head, I remembered vividly that there were at least another ten portions of other different dishes we ordered from the display counter for our lunch. All dishes tasted delicious and spicy when warm and hot. The moment when the curry fish head had cooled down to almost-room temperature that we detected a slightly fishy odour when eating the flesh, which indicated that the snapper head used there was not all that fresh. I lost my entire appetite for any curry fish head since that lunch. Please do not get me wrong. What I meant was that the fish was nicely cooked with curry spices that were well balanced in a fabulous hot thick curry. The fish head flesh in the curry was the most disappointing dish on that day for me and my colleagues.Though it was not as cheap as what you would find in Little India, but it was still an excellent meal in a lovely dining atmosphere. Even though the setting of Samy’s Curry Restaurant is like a coffee shop or a canteen, the service there is of fine-dining standard. Their waiters are particularly attentive and prompt. However, if you just want authentic Indian food and some of the best you have ever had, then you are in the right place
4
After an absence of twenty odd years,revisiting this eatery with my family. Set in a lush and exclusive setting of Dempsey compound, I was relieved to see there's an air conditioning room, in view of the worsening haze drifting over from Sumatra Indonesia. Otherwise I would choose to sit along the corridors of this colonial barrack alfresco. It looks like a family run establishment hence the service is a little haphazard but friendly. Limited selection of wines and beers but the refreshing kalamansi lime juice more than make up for it. Rice (plain white or basmati briyani) is served on a large banana leaf...with server coming around with dhals and cucumber raita. The signature fish head curry is moust and tender. The huge tandoori prawn was actually not chewy nor tough,with a natural sweetness to it. The potato Pattie was light and crunchy and not oily. Chicken tandoori was a bit dry. Mutton curry was cubed bite size and the gravy went well with the basmati briyani. The fried cauliflower was also a delight to eat. I usually associate indian food to be heavy handed with spices but at Samy I found the spices were distinct but not overpowering
4
I was really in the mood for some good Indian food and Samy's took care of that craving. The setting is really nice in an old building, set amongst a row of other restaurants. We had the feeling it was a lot of locals, mostly expats, and some families, a knowledgeable tourist here and there.They bring you inside to choose which dishes you'd like, which will be served traditionally on the bananaleaf with rice and some other sides. There were 2 of us and we were advised to pick 2 dishes each however, this turned out to be too much food. Especially since we picked the fish head curry which on it's own was enough to feed 2-4 people. So be careful when ordering.... they want to make money I think. Anyway, all the food was delicious. Fish head, mutton, cauliflower, spinach. Though it wasn't as cheap as what you'll find in Little India, it was still an excellent meal. The staff didn't mind helping us out at the end to get a taxi either, which was nice
4
delicious fresh and spicy food. the mutton, fish head curry is excellent. i prefer their biryani rice with my meals and the leomanade and coconut water is a great accompaniment. always crowded so many time we call and order and take away. great place to tae folks from out of town or a perfect sunday lunch with chilled bee
4
Great for their briyani which is my fave in town. Prices though are a lot higher than what they used to be at their outlet in the old Marina Square food court.

Being Indian and living in Singapore, we visited Samy's Curry at Dempsey Hill last week, out of curiosity. We had visited Samy's about 5 yrs ago and being very disappointed, never returned. However, having seen good reviews praising the food and the location of this restaurant we decided to give it a try once more.We were disappointed. The Food was firstly cold, and seems to have been made hours ago, and not very tasty. Indian food has to be eaten fresh and hot. The novelty of the food being served on the banana leaf and our of 'buckets' can be seen in other restaurants in Little India. The taste has been compromised to suite an international palette. The location of the restaurant though in Dempsey Hill, makes no use of the nice surroundings. The interior is very substandard and nothing Indian about it at all.The only saving grace was the very friendly and humorous waiter who kept us in fits of laughter. And they serve King Fisher Beer. If one wants to eat at Dempsey Hill, one is spoilt for choice so look at all your options. There are many available. If looking to eat Indian Food in Singapore, I would look at Little India where there is true Indian Cuisine with the right mood
4
thi splace I have visited so many times and each time the food is been very good, the servoce is fast and good and if you like to eat curry then you are at the right place, king prwans, chicken etc.. all are every time been great
5
I came for brunch with my wife. They have excellent banana leaf rice with lots of extra options. I can recommend the Mysore mutton and the fried cauliflower. The service is pretty good. It's a little more expensive, but very good value given the location and the quality. Recommended
5
When I was living in Singapore, I reggularly had friends visiting, and I always took them to Samy's Curry. The atmosphere is very local Indian, and the food is served on banana leafs - something most foreigners are amazed over. Ask the waiters to just bring different types of food to the table, and taste everything they present to you. If you like Indian food and curry, you will have a fantastic meal
4
We were taken here by a friend and her family who live in Singapore. It's in the lovely area of Dempsey which has any number of places to eat.On entering Samys it's not flash but don't be put off, order a lime juice or a beer and then choose your food which will be brought to your table to eat off the banana leaf. The fish head curry is well worth ordering (don't be put off its delicious!) we tried just about all the curries and all are so good so order small plates of each and go with friends!
5
Visited recently to introduce friends to the joys of traditional banana leaf curry. They were blown away. the food the atmosphere everything.I wish I could get a CD of the happy babble in Samy's to play when I make curry meals at home.A must visit whenever in Singapor
4
Indeed a great place to have Indian food. This former sergeant's mess in the British era of Singapore provides a rather lovely ambience for your spicy meal. A great place to bring friends, family and guests coming to Singapore. My favourites here are the Curry Fish Head, Fish cutlets, Fried pomfret, Chicken 65 and mutton masala. Try eating your food on the Banana leaf with bare hands it will make food taste even better. End of the meal with a lovely hot Nescafe, it's something of tradition here. And cheers if you are having the Indian made beer Kingfisher.
4
Very nice service really. Friendly waiters and very helpful and patient. This us a HUGE warehouse where you eat on banana leaves. There are a lot of local Singaporian and/or Indian patrons. You are supposed to go to a counter and choose your food. There is plenty if choices. If you like spicy ( what I suspect to be) Southern Indian food ...then you will like the place ! If you don't , then leave the place - great vegetable dishes from lentils , to okras . Plenty plenty of dishes to choose from. Kids love it. Great place to have large groups as well. This is a local, relaxed , authentic institution, not a Michelin Star restaurant but who cares about Michelin these days ?NB. It is so big that I never had an issue finding a table ..which is a big big plus in Singapor
5
I thought Dempsey Hill restaurants meant dressing up... wrong for Samy's. But forgive the boarding school appearance of the back room (no money spent on decorations here) because the food was excellent. Messy with the Curry Crab but the flavours of every dish we had were excellent. Be prepared to pay the $SD 50+ for a $AUD 20 wine, but the dishes are so reasonble the bill was okay. $SD210 for filling meal for 4 adults + three kids (11-13) including all drinks. We asked for additional rice, nann bread, raita etc during the meal. Would go again.
3
Food was good but not great, need to improve on overall cleanliness. The fishhead curry as well as the whole squid are wonderful.
4
Visited samy's curry few years back ago . Parking is free at Dempsey. I ordered their curry chicken and fried fish and I think the food is very nice and price is reasonable.
5
A firm favourite is the vegetarian biryani, which comes with biryani rice, the 2 veg of the day (heaven only knows how the get veg to taste so good), daal, sambar, yoghurt and papadums. Wash it down a cold glass of fresh lime juice. I only wish they had a separate vegetarian section as seeing people eat fish heads next to you can put you right off your meal.
5
After a day of eating....from hawkers halls, to Chin Chin for chicken rice....my wife and I were.....done. As we laid around the hotel toward 9 pm, I said we really should try the infamous fish head stew at Samy's. Ran out, grabbed a cab....grabbed a table and ordered.....One of my top 5 dishes of my 60 years of travel. A deeply flavored and spiced broth was the star of the evening. You could cook a shoe in it and it would have been fine. As unappetizing as the fish head sounds to most of us Americans...this was just something one must try
5
Samy's it is a bit different from the usual Indian restaurants. It can be quite communal, with long tables in the middle that different groups sit at. Or there are round tables inside and out if you get there in time or make a reservation. The food is ordered at a counter but extra sauces and vegetables are brought round to the tables by the waiters and are included in the price. The Tiger beers are served from huge glass bottles in cold plastic tankards and there are lots of fresh juices available. When you get the bill at the end the reasonable prices for a blow out meal are a nice surprise
4
Eight of us had dinner here with advance reservation at 6 pm. Although some of us arrived earlier than 6 pm, the restaurant was not ready to receive us. Some workers were still sleeping on the benches and floor. They refused to take order for coconut and lime juice drinks until 6 pm. The quality of the food remains good and affordable. We ordered a large curry fish head, mysore mutton, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, baskets of naan, black squids and bryani rice, Thoroughly enjoyable. Ample parking if you come early
5
The first time we visited Singapore we tried to find Samys but couldn't, but made it this time and it was well worth it. It is in Dempsey Hill the old colonial bungalows it is set in a lovely location it was nice to have our meal sat outside on the verandah. The curry is served on a banana leaf, it was so tasty and well worth the hunt to find it. It is situated straight on from the orchid gardens, 10mins up the road on your left
5
I cannot recommend this curry house highly enough. I recall there is a thriving Little India part of Singapore, but this lies apart in a finely landscaped green area.Enormous helpings are served. I think you are given almost every kind of meat! I ALWAYS visit Samy's when I am in Singapore
5
Thought we would try out this place as Anthony Bourdain recommended on his "Layover in Singapore" cable TV show, and we were not disappointed. Samys specialises in North and South Indian Cuisine, the flavours are scrumptious, the service is fast and efficient and it's only a short cab fare away. Go there, you will love it
5
On the site of the old army barracks in Dempsey, this basic restaurant serves the most delicious curries atop a banana leaf. Fresh flavorsome & down to earth, I'd recommend this place highly to anyone who likes a good curry. Prices are reasonable (great value in comparison to the many overpriced places in Singapore) & the waiter we had, was friendly, provided great service & had a wicked sense of humor
5
i love indian food! I love indian food! (one more time) I love Indian food! really!
This place is perfect! what else can you expect from an indian restaurant? Eat on a banana leave with your hands or with fork and spoon. Delicious !
1
Not bad food ...terrible service though. ..sorry, but you can't ride in tradition forever...you also have to show some respect to customers ... stop being rude - your food is good, but not that good.
4
We had a Mother's Day lunch at Samy's Curry. Not having visited for more than three years, the food was as good as before.For the four of us we ordered a fish head curry, masala crabs and chicken masala. All met our expectation. However, it is spicy for those who are not used to it. We booked in advance and asked for a table along the veranda which is cooler than the main dining hall. Also the main dining hall has long tables much like a 'canteen' style of dining. We chose lunch over dinner to avoid mosquitoes especially along the veranda which is close to the foliage. Sure enough, one of us got bitten within 5 minutes, even at lunch time. Service is efficient and the food arrived within minutes of our order

Samy's is traditional in a positive way, traditional architecture, plenty of space and the best curry I have had in Singapore. Plenty of choices and generous portions that just keep coming. Excellent dal and lassi drinks. A touch of the Empire but rather like a film set! Fun
3
Location is a little bit remote but in a very nice atmospehere.Food was good, but not spectacular.Curry fishhead was very goodChicken dishes average.Naan soso.Lassi was mixed with too much water and the ice cubes made it worse after a while.Comparing it to another well know restaurant serving indian dishes on banana leaves in Singapore, only reason to go there is the fish head curry
4
Took my son and husband here as their first experience of a 'banana leaf restaurant'. Had fish head curry (all mine and very delish!), chicken tandoori (best ever according to my husband), and some other small dishes (they were ok, but these two were the standouts). Very worthwhile to visit, good quality, local food.

Nice food and staff. Ate here with my in laws as they wanted to show me fish head curry. Food court style/hygiene in my opinion and I'm getting used to it after dining local a few times now. Food is good and the hygiene is probably better than it looks like with european eyes. Both chicken and fish dishes was good
2
I used to patronised Samy's curry even my daughter told me that she found baby cokroach in her cauliflower.  I have stopped going for a while since I witnessed with my own eyes how unhygienic the serving staf were.The banana leaves used as plate dropped on the floor and the particular waitress picked them up and put them together with the other leaves. Another staff took the dirty leaves and served them to other customers. It doesn't cost so much for the restaurant to throw away the dirty leaves.My friends have also stopped patronising your outlet so do my daughter's friends. Please educate your staffs on hygiene as this country is famous for its cleanliness.

The friend i was staying with took my wife and myself to this restaurant. He was a regular customer and we weren't disappointed. though the menu is brief whatever you order is really tasty. Everything is served on banana leaves. The bill was on the cheap side and the cooking puts many British curry houses to shame. Apparently the staff has improved over the years. Recommende

Samys restaurant has a beautiful colonial feel to it. As soon as you approach it, you start enjoying the experience. it is much better to sit outside and enjoy the view of the trees. The waiter brings over a banana leaf that is your plate. The food is great and sensible portions. The Dahl is one of the best I have ever had. It is unique and rather wonderful
5
Samy's is one of my go-to places for yummy Indian food. love the authentic, no-frills vibe of the restaurant. Food is absolutely delicious
3
The service is good, the food is average. The beer is cheap. The food is pre-cooked and kept in keep warm cabinets.

I was a regular patron of Samys when we lived in Singapore in the early 1980s and return visits have been an essential part of Singapore stopovers during the last 30 years. This recent visit was the first for about 3 years and unfortunately was a bit of a disappointment. The old colonial building (Civil Service Club) is still there and the restaurant sill seemed popular. You still eat with your fingers (spoon and fork available of course) off a banana leaf and the food is still very good. My disappointment was due to the introduction of menus which means you have to order too much if you want a variety (previously a procession of waiters would wander round with a pot of food and a ladle and you could try a little bit of everything). So please still try Samys but go in a group or be prepared to eat too much (mind you at the reasonable prices you could afford to eat half the portions). We still only spent S$50 for two of us. You can take a taxi there but be prepared to walk to main road for bus or taxi home

Came by for an impromptu lunch after seeing the restaurant being featured in a segment of a local food programme. I was expecting to pay mid-range prices, considering the popularity of the restaurant and it being located in a prime area (Dempsey Hill). Was pleasantly surprised to be greeted by a non-fancy, authentic restaurant setting and very attentive, efficient-serving wait staff. My fiance and I ordered a small curry fish head ($20), I had the biryani rice with veg ($3.60), while he had 2 raisin naans ($7). The curry fish head is known to be the best in Singapore, and I must agree it really is very good. We thought the gravy could be less salty, though the fish was very fresh and tender. The rice was delicious too - I finished up the entire portion (very delicious when mixed with the gravies of the veggies and curry fish head) and also asked for additional servings of fresh, crispy papadom! Definitely one of the best meals I've had in Singapore, and for a really filling meal at just about $40 for 2 pax, I will definitely be back very soon! Highly recommended
5
Having visited this well known restaurant over the years I am never disappointed in the consistency of the standard and quality of the menu.The venue is ideally situated on a historic site in Singapore adjacent to the original Botanical Gardens.Experence the famous banana leaf curry served in an traditional Singaporean restaurant where the large ceiling fans provide a background distraction to the atmosphere. Moderately priced and you never leave hungry
4
Our first visit and it won't be the last to one of the first (if not the first) traditional curry houses in Singapore. Our hosts ordered and paid so I cannot comment on price or choice other than to note the quality of everything we ate was if a high quality and the ambience great. Only downside: state of the bathrooms which are not up to Singapore standard. Queues confirmed the need to book and be there on time if you've reserved a table.

Having lived in Singapore for several years we finally turned up at Samy's a year or two ago and have kept coming back regularly ever since, often on a Sunday afternoon. The place reminds me of a Singapore of some 20 years ago and the restaurant is basic: white walls, fans, simple tables and banana trees between you and the loos. But sitting outside under the fans and staring through the foliage, over your banana leaf plate, the place has some atmosphere.The menu is simple, which is fine. I have tried the meat curries but, frankly, was not too keen since the style is dry. I keep coming back for the same combination: fish curry, biryani rice, possibly a nan bread and a beer. I don't know if they give preferential service to a regular face but unlike some reviewers I have never been short changed on portions. Just the opposite. I've always had free flow rice and the associated vegetables. What I like most is that the fish always seems to be very white, very juicy and very fresh and the curry sauce is pungent. Its also very reasonable.This is a simple, enjoyable meal, nothing to rave about. But it is also an authentic one, which is an increasingly rare experience when competition amongst restaurants is so fierce. I like it. I hope they just keep carrying on as they are
3
This restaurant, located at Dempsy Road, has been around for a long long time. While the curry is not that different from other restaurants, they still have that 'It' factor that makes it fun to take guests to. Large seating area, great beer selection, friendly staff. if you are new to Singapore, you definitely should try it out
4
I am a tourist and this was fun! :) The restaurant is in an historic building. Selection of curries and other dishes is not extensive, but that is ok. Everything served on a banana leaf. Eat with your hands or with cutlery, your choice. We had butter chicken = good,tasty sauce.Okra (lady fingers) = ok. Sambal prawns = good. The rice was excellent. The pumpkin dhal was excellent. Our waiter was super funny, which also added to the fun. I would go back and take friends here
5
Big, intense flavors, especially in the signature dish -fish head curry. Fun place to go with a group and eat family style. Service was decent, and the pitchers of beer were frosty. They don't use plates, rather they use a banana leaf heaped with a mountain of rice to eat from
5
Don't expect fancy cutlery etc. Your food is served on a banana leaf and the restaurant is 'food hall'-style. Consistently fabulous Indian food at reasonable prices.
4
Samy's remains one of the best-value restaurants on the chic Dempsey Hill enclave. The chicken masala is to die for. It also has better vegetables than equivalent Chettinad restaurants (Banana Leaf Apollo, Muthu's et al). While the food/service remain what they have always been, on recent visits, I have noticed the waitstaff hustle you to order more. They also appear unhappy if you just order water for drinks
3
Great authentic Indian food, traditionally served on banana leaves. You get the standard rice with sides, and you order mains of fish, chicken or mutton. Fish head curry is good, but not the best in Singapore. Great for a pit stop meal but not really a place to hang out. It's a former messing hall anyway, so it's not like a cosy place with great view.
2
I visited this restaurant about seven years ago. I said to my group then.. "I will never return!" Last week I was invited for a meal and guess what… to this same restaurant. Being open minded and a little forgiving, I reserved my opinion until the (I now call it an) 'ordeal' was over. I cannot believe that people are so accepting at getting lousy food dished up. It is a "banana leaf" thing…but what they dish onto the leaf is 'in my opinion' is not fit to eat besides what it looks like. And, by the way…it was the same the previous time. Very disappointing and half the menu items were unavailable. So, make of it what you will if you go there…I will definitely not be doing any eating there again.Forgive me if I am wrong…this is what Trip Advisor is for…right
3
Haven't been here since the '90s, and outwardly it hasn't changed much.The food is served on a banana leaf with a couple of side dishes (nice).The food was ok, but not justified by the price $50 for two (without beer) - and that was two small dishes and a small veg. All the same, we enjoyed it, however we probably won't bother going backIf you went in the evening there are other places around to have a drink
4
We spent the day at the Singapore Botanical Gardens and Samy's is a little walk off from the gardens and quite a long walk from the nearest MRT. However the walking pays off.Huge portions of biriyani and tasty Indian dishes accompanied by the restaurant's own lime juice were simply great. The staff isn't the most smiling-customer service type but they bring you food with such velocity that it doesn't really matter
3
My wife and I had lunch a la Samy's today and we wern't hungry afterwards. Thats about all I can of to write in praise. On the other hand: the food is average, the waiters are almost awake, the lamb curry did have flavour but of what I am not sure. The price for 2 including a cup of tea and a lime juice was Sgd55. Its a rip off and there are far better restaurants to be found in little India or along Arab street
5
I can say that I've pretty much grown up on this type of Indian food (25 years), and my dad started eating here in the 1980's. Nothing much has changed except for the service staff and the portions (because of natural inflation I'm guessing). We usually order our food to go, and we will be eating it for the next 3-4 meals. We absolutely love the food.Dishes to order: Chicken Tikka, Fish Curry, Chicken Curry, Mutton Mysore, Mutton Curry, Masala Chicken and Fish Cutlets. It may seem pricey for some patrons, but I believe that it is value for money, especially if you order it to go and lap up every drop of curry
5
Having visited Samy's 6 years ago with my family I felt it would be a great place to take my new Husband to experience the fun and amazing food. It did not let me down, the food is sensational and was a great New Years Day dinner for me and my husband on our honeymoon.We booked a table in advance so we could sit outside and did this over email. The response was prompt and accurate and our table was ready on arrival.I am however very disappointed that we did not get given a banana leaf!??That being said the food and experience was great yet again. Thanks
5
We came here on the recommendation of a Singapore resident who said it would be one of the best curry's we've ever had... he wasn't wrong :-)Samy's was just fabulous... if you are looking for a fine dining, five star, high end dining experience, this is not it ;-) but if you just want authentic Indian food and some of the best you've ever had, then you are in the right place...The food is served on banana leaves and is very simple, but delicious... we tried about 6 different dishes (a bit overkill but we wanted to try so many things on the menu!)...We absolutely loved Samy's and will be back here in a heartbeat..
3
This restaurant serves a combination of south Indian, Sri Lankan, Malaysian cuisine on a banana leaf. Its great as an experience for the locals and expatriates but since I was visiting from India, I found the food strongly pungent and not remarkable.
5
Come on, been to Singapore and missed out Samy's curry.....not done man. No one can beat their fish curry and rice over banana leaves!
3
I came solely for the Fish Head Curry. It was delicious. Beyond that I wasn't too enamored with the experience. It's simply not good enough to come back.
5
It was a drizzly evening when out taxi took us to Samy's. We just ran the Half-Marathon at the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore and was in need for a calories replenishment. Any replenish we did! With a hefty serving of rice and vegetables on a banana leaf we started with fried white pomfret (a MUST have) followed by curried crabs and chicken masala. We washed it all down with Mango Lassi and finally Teh Tarik (a local favourite). All in, it was a memorable dinner and quite reasonable on the pocket. Make sure you book your table at the air-conditioned room or otherwise, you'll be sweating with the masses
4
If your taste buds are looking for a melange of spices, then Samy's curry is the place. The restaurant is housed in an old building which adds to the charm.You can chose to sit outside or inside, I would recommend outside. The restaurant boasts of food cooked with asian ( Indian) spices which lives up to expectations. Food served on banana leaf at least for me, fills me with intrigue and excitement.There is a set meal, which consists of rice/ biryani/, one vegetable , sambar( lentil soup with vegetables) ,over and above of which you can add a non veg dish from the menu or stick to fish curry or mutton curry. They have crabs, fish, lobsters ,lamb & chicken in the nonveg section if you wish to chose form those. A very affordable place. The service is quick, the moment you start dining the food is served one by one. Look out for free popadum. So if you're a local in Singapore, repeat Samy's curry now and then for best results and if you're a tourist , it's an experience that will make you come back again:) Please note this place is closed on tuesdays
4
We went for lunch. Make sure you arrive before 12:15 in order to get an outside table, inside it is rather hot and noisy. The fact that most customers are Indian/Asian tells you that it is an authentic place and the food bears that out. The building is quite modern and a 20 minute walk from the nearest MRT station (or S$5 taxi ride) but full of office workers. The food is cheap but very good. Beers are not cheap. Free popaums come immediately. We ordered chicken, rice and cauliflower. The chicken arrived, with extra sauce, but nothing else. Eventually the rice person arrived with a big bowl (have as much as you like) andnthen another person with servings of curried french beans and a sauce (not sure what). IF we had known that rice and side orders and inclusive sides would arrive about 10 minutes after the main dish then we would not have been so stressed and annoyed. Once it all had arrived our mood changed and we really enjoyed the food. Large portions, so if you are in a group do a lot of sharing.Service is brisk - I got the impression that many staff did not understand my English - but they are helpful. The bill was S$50 for two - the food was half that and 2 beers made up the other half. A good experience an
4
My husband and I go here every time we come to Singapore, (2x per year), and the food is still very good and spicy and we love the old colonial feel of the place, like a hilltop family house, NOT at all a "coffee house". Sure, it is not luxurious but that is what makes it authentic. The curries are all delicious, and eating them on a banana leaf makes them even tastier. Very enjoyable experience and fair prices. Good for couples, singles, or large groups
3
I find the food is above average but when the bill comes it always makes me feel it seems to be more expensive than what I have expected.But the food is really not bad if you like Indian food, but the ambiance is like coffee shop... they have not renovated it since long time ago... wonder if they will ever do it. But I think the price will be steeper if they do. So maybe just stay the way there are,..Do not mind going there once in a while if I have cravings for curry
4
It has been over 12 years since I last ate here, and recent reviews suggest that the place is not what it was. So it was with some trepidation that I made a booking and arrived. I need not have worried too much.True, it is more expensive than it was (mind you, we did not hold back on our order), and the setting is no longer so unique - other restaurants bussle in where in the past was the sound of tennis and wildlife. The decor is as it was - open, functional and...err...functional.But the food is still good - strong flavours pack a punch.We ordered just about everything that could fit on our banana leaf. The dry chicken and lamb curries were really tasty, and meant to be dry. Tandoori chicken came with a fearsome sauce. Butter chicken was sublime, and the three other vegetable dishes were very good. I think there was more but can't recall. The jug of tiger beer went down well, as well.So - why not 5 stars? I think I have said elsewhere that to get 5 stars means something very special. This place was very good, but it has changed and has become more functional than I remember. Maybe my memories are playing tricks, or perhaps the novelty that was so unusual 12 years ago is no longer that novel.I was pleased I returned, though. And have a booking ready for 2026...My friend struggled with the heat, both with the meal and subsequently (!) but I though

Went to check out Samy's curry at Dempsey after hearing so much about it. Nothing to say about ambience. It's like a huge coffee shop. Only cooler. Food served was way too little. I don't mind paying for good food. But the portions were disastrous. 8 miserable half-thumb sized cubes of mutton swimming in ordinary curry for $10. That's stupidity if you can cook. The waitress who served my hubby rice was counting the grains. She didn't serve him papadams. Then after my hubby had finished his meal, the guy sitting next to us was given papadams with his rice meal. $5 for masala chicken (thigh portion). Chicken was small like spring chicken. And $5 for that was ridiculous. As I don't eat rice at night, I only had 2 cubes of mutton. And I was given a huge banana leaf for that. Usually when you order rice meal in Indian restaurants, you get a generous portion of rice and 3 proper veggies and curry and papadams. This was the first time I saw a rice meal served with miserable onion chutney! Mutton curry, rice, chicken masala, brinjal and a lime juice and a glass of beer costed us $55. And I had the lime juice and 2 cubes of mutton only. Don't bother dining here.
5
This is the best Indian restaurant probably in the entire world, the chicken masala is simply heavenly so are the other food choices. You will never regret visiting this authentic Indian restaurant.
3
The place is not easy to locate since it's way off the main road. The food was very spicy and there is limited vegetarian options.
4
Very nice traditional Indian food, cheap compared to other restaurants but not somewhere I would rush to again.
3
Don't bother with Samy's. The curry lacked gravy, the lime juice lacked flavour, and the venue lacked style. Banana Leaf Apollo in Little India is so much better.
3
Staff friendly not a huge selection.....the food was ok. Priced reasonably for Singapore. A bit out of the way so you'll need a taxi to get there . The place has a real colonial feel about it high ceilings with old ceiling fans. One thing staff friendly to organize a taxi minimal wait. A big plus the draft tiger beer was icy cold
4
We reserved a table for 13 and were very pleased with the variety of plates, overall quality, and the service. Samy's is little difficult to get to as many have said--it requires a taxi from one of several MRT stations, but is near a few other interesting places on Dempsey Hill. The staff helped us with the selections,but we did get their signature fish-head curry as well as their dry lamb curry which was my favorite and that of many in our group. Pitchers of beer were reasonably priced (for Singapore--which means the price was merely high, not outrageous), the bottomless daal bucket was good and the rice was good, too. I'd highly recommend Samy's for large groups at a decent price. We fed and beered 13 people for well under $300 US and had more food than we could eat
4
Situated amidst lush leafy surrounds, it's almost like eating in an Indian village rather than in a city like Singapore. We ordered fish head curry, lamb & chicken dry curry & calamari curry. All very good served on banana leaf. Only problem was there was no toilet paper in the ladies. When I told them, they gave me serviettes instead
2
A few years ago Samy's was a reliable go to for a good fish head curry and a reasonably priced decent Indian meal. We went there recently as a last minute impulse and regret we ever did. While the service was helpful and polite and the setting absolutely fine,the food was a major let down. The fish head tasted of dirt and when we sent it back suggesting it was not fresh the immediate acceptance of our complaint made us feel that they knew we were right and no replacement fish head was offered except for bowls of dahl.The fish tikka was good and the briyani was greasy and bland.The cucumber raita was a very sorry apology with a few random slices and no yoghourt in sight. Our other mistake was to arrive at 9 and it was very clear they wanted us gone by 10 when they closed as fans were turned off and some lights around our table. Come on guys,you used to be really good once but have now badly lost the plot
3
Our hosts in singapore wanted us to feel at home and hence took us to this much talked place .....Well perched atop a small hillock and amidst must greenery this place was earlier a colonial building now converted into a south indian style eating place.Our initial apprehension of quality of the preparation came true when we had our portions laid out. Things seemed out of place and poorly prepared perhaps stylized or modified for singapore taste.We did not like the food....the chicken was rubber like and the only thing worth talking was the fisheverything else was passableDo go only if you have a craving for indian food and can't miss it for even few days in case you are an indian. For other people.....please do look for some more places serving indian food as they might be better while you are in singapor
4
I came here as I had fond memories of this place since my childhood - yes, this place has been around for a long long time. The store is located on Dempsey Road , so we had to go there by taxi. The food is as good as it was back then. However, there are many new Indian restaurants that have popped up all over the place, so Samy's Curry has lost some of its significance. Anyway, curry fish head, which they are famous for, was still good. However, their Naan was a bit thin and dry. Come here for a bit of Singapore history
4
Authentic Indian cuisine with nice atmosphere and reasonably priced. Good centralised location to chill and chat up with old buddies over food and drinks. They sell alcoholic drinks too, so for Muslims, do beware.
1
Samy's curry used to be quite sought after by both tourists and Indians. It was serving quality food in both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. I have even conducted parties, brought my colleagues for lunch/dinner at this place. It used to be a place of satisfaction. However in the recent years, it seems like samy's curry lost chef samy for some reason. The service was fast, the food was hot. But there was practically just rice on your plate. The waiters seem to be putting up a good show for foreigners. Unfortunately, its an utter disappointment that standards have drastically dropped. I was served practically 2 types of side dishes which usually comes with 4-5 varieties. If you think you're going for a true indian cuisine dining experience, its time to rethink your options. Suddenly i feel my local coffee shop is doing a better job. They are more worried about your money so they probably will serve anything to you. Even after i raised the issue, i was offered no solution or alternatives. All the waiters suddenly find themselves in the middle of a drama stage. The non veg dishes, probably cooked itself inside the kitchen. Good Indian food along with service is rare, I personally think it's an insult to the Indian culture. Don't be fooled, this one is rolling down the hill soon
4
Had dinner there last night and was pleasantly surprised. Good authentic Indian food served in a traditional way on a banana leaf by great staff. Ordered what I thought was enough for 2 hungry diners and we had heaps of food left over - very generous servings. The next pleasant surprise was the price. I will go back often
5
Got there at almost 2pm and was quite busy.We ordeted 3 banana leaf meals and choose some amazing masala chicken my favorite and alsi fish roe;chicken 65 and mutton mysore also was just perfect .Owner was very attentive and even exchanged namecard.All the best to you Samy's
4
Moderately priced, excellent food, convenient location is how I would describe the Samy's Curry at Dempsey Hill. The Chicken Masala, Fish Fry, Mutton Sukkha, and the curries with rice and awesome. Unlimited supplies of papad's..... With a selection of Beer, Wine... What more could one ask for....All this at a price ( the bill ) which brings a smile to your face after the meal
4
Met here with friends who live in Singapore and recommended Samy's. Loved the friendly atmosphere, the unusual eating from banana leaves and the continual circulation of various curries to try. An experience enjoyed all the more by catching up with friends not seen for several years. If you have time to spare, try the Samy's experience
3
We went to Samy's on two or three strong recommendations. Masala chicken was amazing the rest was ver nice but really just standard fare. We had veg of the day and gobi (cauli) and tandoori fish - which was tiny but tasty. We had a nice meal and it was certainly good value but not sure it is worth the reviews we had got. Tripadvisor ranking looks better on this one
4
Location : Dempsey hill ., beautiful ,,, It was my first time and I was really impressed. We had masala chicken - 5 sgd per piece. The piece is quite big. White rice/biryani rice - unlimited with rasam/sambar, salad and papad Crab curry - 10 sgd per plate , around 2-3 small to medium size crabs . Juicy, yummy .. Was quite surprised that it was so tasty . We also tried a veg dish - palak paneer. It was spicy but good .. But with crab and chicken no match at all . Less options for veggies !! Overall very good place !
4
My wife and I first ate at Samy's restaurant around 1980 and we haven't been there for around 25 years. We are delighted to see on our recent visit to Singapore that the restaurant is still in its original location, close to the Botanic Gardens.Some elements of eating there remain the same, for example, the use of banana leaves instead of plates but the waiters are now in smart uniforms rather than dirty dhotis and in the past the food offerings were often part of a guessing game. Now there is a colourful illustrated menu. There is a wide selection of dishes and the number of diners present suggested that the restaurant is still a popular venue and offers value for money as well as historical character
3
Samy's was founded in the 50's and has been at this location since the 80's. The decoration probably hasn't changed since then, or at least in the 15 years we've been going here; neither has the service style nor the menu. The signature fish head curry is excellent, other dishes range from pretty bad (chicken liver masala, mysore button, soggy papadum, dhal) to OK (masala chicken): except for the fish head curry, none of the other dishes comes hot! Service is like at the army, ie. minimal (although they don't charge a service fee!) People from all walks of life come to this place, including those who don't walk but drive in their Bentleys or Porsches. It is more for the touristic or memory lane value, because you can certainly find better Indian food elsewhere
1
This place was very disappointing!! Despite asking for mild curries it was mind blowingly hot and inedible. The place has stray cats wandering around which was also off putting.
4
I've only tried the Masala Chicken from this place despite being a repeat customer. It is really delicious. It's hot and spicy though, so if you can't take it, avoid it.Service is okay. Nothing special to highlight. I don't really like the atmosphere. It's non-aircon, so quite stuffy, especially when you're eating spicy food.Recommended
4
Having traveled to India, I can safely say that Samy's Curry was as authentic as it gets! The food was delicious, be adventurous and take recommendation from the friendly staff. We tried a few different dishes and all were equally good. It was very busy with lots of different people which made for a great atmosphere
4
Samy's curry has been around for 50 years which proof something of consistent quality. A simple setting in Dempsey where a lot of more designed cafe/ restaurants are situated deeper inside the area.The setting in an opened air but not too hot due to high ceiling and not many building around.The quality of banana leaf rice is as good as expected and with few other choices to choose from. Service is fast and efficient. A must try for someone who love simple but good Indian food in an no frill setting
4
Eating from a banana leaf in the cooling hills of Dempsey, one cannot dream of a better place for one of the best value for money indian food in Singapore.Very tasty cuisine, choice is made fast, service is prompt, this no frills place is perfect for a relax family diner on week-ends; or get together with friends.A must go place for tourists and a perfect relaxing place for residents to go back to
4
My husband has been living in Singapore for 7 years, and he has always been talking about this place. So when we visit Singapore together, off cause we had to visit Sammy's. We got a lot of different dishes - that we shared. It was very tasty and I think it was funny that it was served on banana leaves. When my husband lived there it was real banana leaves - now it is in plastic. It doesn't matter we had a great evening and nice Indian food. We'll be back next time we visit Singapore
1
Samy's Indian restaurant in Dempey's Hill,has for years had a reputation for very good authentic Indian curry, eating from the banana leaf. Personally I've been coming for years and tonight I'm afraid has been an experience I'd like to forget and hope the management can act swiftly to change the quality otherwise the future of the restaurant in my opinion is in real danger.To give the restaurant some credit they did try to replace all dishes served however the damage had been done.On arrival, and been seated at our reserved table my family entered the restaurant to select the food. The kitchen area looks unclean, grotty and didn't give good impression. The staff very quickly and unclearly described the different dishes available which was not understood.Now to the meal.Sat at the dinner table we were served cold rice, cold curry sauce , soggy popadoms and all of the selected dishes were unacceptably heated.I called for the manager, explaining that all dishes were unacceptable and to please remove the food .The manager to be fair was apologetic and tried to replace all food but as said previously the damage was already done.Good luck if you try Samy's. I shall continue to read reviews however won't return until far more positive reviews are given

Though the ambience is authentic Singaporean and a must try for the experience, the price does not reflect on the quality of food and service. There were four adults in our party and two children aged 2 & 5. The rice portions for the two kids was less then a full serving spoon yet we were charged for 6 portions of rice. The mutton masala though tasty was a little dry and pricey for a large portion of $13 which was not large at all. The bread basket was $14 - it comprised of not more then four types of naan which at other restaurants would be approx $10. Given that this place is in Dempsey where there are alot of fancy restaurants and this not being one of them the price and quality of food is not worth the price. Hygiene is lacking as well because when we went to the food counter to order our meal, there were flies sitting on the various dishes. This is totally not acceptable I felt like walking out but we had brought guests who wanted to experience 'Samys'. I would not go back to this restaurant

I love Indian food for a wide range of flavors, textures and colors. Samys possed nono of these atribuites. We ate at 8.30 on a saturday evening and it felt as though we were being offered the last of the food that had been made for the weekend rush. About a third of the menu options were not available and the ones that we did select and were poorly pressented, overcooked and bland.The only good thing I can say is that it was cheap for Dempsey Hill but you know why
3
The thing about this place is that although the food is spicy and to our taste, you get the feeling that the staff have been working here for way way too long and have become bored and disinterested.And some have been here for a long long time. Perhaps they should get some new staff in to improve the attitude and service standards
4
First time back after 20 years (since we lived in Singapore) it's still my favorite curry house. Especially the dry mutton curry.
4
Great food served on Banyon leaves, assisted by very attentive servers. A gem, to be sure. Be sure to reserve an outside deck table for better ambiance and breeze..
5
The food is delicious and spicy. The staff are courteous and attentive. They don't serve it hot though and tons of Mosquitos chew you up.
5
If you want nice hearty lunch or dinner in an unpretentious place, go to Samy's. Nice outdoor seating with a bit of garden view. Lime juice or beer as drinks.Service done on a banana leaf with waiters passing around rice, vegetable of the day, dhal and papadams. A must is the fish head curry to be shared by the table. Then dry Mysore mutton, fish cutlets and that's a perfect meal.Efficient service with a smile

This restaurant came recommended to me by my parents who visited 18 months previously. At first you don't quite know what to make of the place as it is very different to restaurants back home and is quite a way away from downtown Singapore. You are asked to choose your food from a deli counter of freshly cooked curry, including side dishes after which you are seated and your selections are brought to you, served on a banana leaf (nice touch). Various pickles and vegetable curries are added to your leaf free of charge as are poppadoms. I have never been so satisfied after a curry in my entire life, it was excellent and I would highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone! Just don't be put off by its appearance
4
Another must stop to eat at when we visit Singapore! Food is tasty and plentiful! The fish head curry is nice as well as the chicken dishes. The added ambiance of everything being served on a banana leaf, tops it off! Great waitstaff and quick eating experience

Having heard about this Singaporean stalwart for many years and despite living there on numerous occasions I had never been. Everyone seemed to rave about it including my hero Mr Anthony Bourdain. What a let down. The food was at best average which given the hype and my expectations was such a disappointment. Had the lamb curry and various sauces on a stone cold portion of rice. The lamb was tough and grisly and really had very little going for it in terms of heat or spice, the extra spinach digs I ordered was v salty, the various sauces served on the rice were all the same taste in various hues of orange & brown and the beans veg curry was dry and overcooked. The absolute best bit was a beautifully cooked plain naan. The place itself retains an old world from a Singapore long forgotten. It's a shame the food doesn't follow suit. @ $30 for two inc 4 soft drinks it was cheap by Singapore standards and the service was charming and attentive once you've figured out their systems but the food? Go to Little India. Better, cheaper and a lot more fun.
5
This place is really fun. The old building was a British military building 100 years ago but now it feels like you have left Singapore and entered India. The wait staff and the enviornment seem very authentic and the food was excellent. A really nice place to dine
3
We were recommended to go to this place by a friend who had been on a recent trip to Singapore. She loved it, so I guess we were expecting big things! I booked before we left because we had been told it was a really popular place and very busy. I received a reply to my booking request three days after I sent it …. but before we were going , so that was okay. I especially requested a table outside, but when we arrived there were no tables available outside (so my request had obviously not been attended to) and we were told that if we wanted to sit outside we'd have to wait until someone else finished. It was a warm night so we waited for an outside table - which we eventually got …. but unfortunately it was right in front of the men's toilet!! Not the greatest position to sit to enjoy your dinner!! The service was slow and not very attentive, but we eventually ordered and our food arrived. The rice was just about passably warm and the dahl was not, it was cold! The fish head curry was very good and the tandoori chicken was reasonable but not "to die for". So all in all the food was reasonable - but certainly not as good as our local Indian here in Perth - so I guess you'd have to say we were disappointed. The service was not very professional and the spot outside the toilet is the pits!! The place generally looks a bit run-down and not exceptionally clean. I didn't experience the toilets in person, but they didn't look great from the outside!! I think Samy's needs to smarten itself up a bit - good service goes a long way towards making a restaurant memorable - or otherwise!
4
All the dishes are unique and quite unusual. We really like the chicken 63 and the butter chicken. The portions are good as is the service. It is not a luxurious place by any means but we have been many times and will keep going back as we like the down to earth feel and the food
4
Went for dinner on a weekday evening. Was not such a crowded evening when we reached. Ordering was easy as one of the friends is a regular and food was served pretty fast. The staff is friendly and flexible to accommodate our requests. Overall good restaurant experience.Location - 7/10Ambiance - 5/10 (Its a basic dinner place, irrespective of the chic location)Friendliness of staff - 9/10Quality of food - 8/10Overall value - 8/10Only one thing - I visited the toilet, it was the worst toilet I've been in Singapore. Dear Samy, please please live up to Singapore's image
4
This has got to have the best fish head curry in town. Brought my overseas Friends to this singapore institution and it delivers consistently in our every visit here. Authentic delicious but very Spicy. Love the lively ambiance . Great place to come with overseas friends
4
A local friend recommended Samy's as a place to take my wife. We has a great experience overall - very authentic food (try the fish curry), great wait staff (very patient and informative), and great ambiance. One piece of advice - most of the food is very spicy. It's so tasty that you want to keep eating, but if you aren't used to this kind of food, you will probably pay a price! :
5
I was taken to Samy's for a slap up meal by a friend, now my girlfriend is upset with me because I can't go to Dempsy Hill without popping to Samy's for lunch. Really good food, at a reasonable price for Dempsy. Be warned some stuff is very hot, that said I still can't help but gorge on everything
4
Samy's Curry, the oldest restaurant in Dempsey before all the fancy restaurants moved in. Awesome fresh and tender Indian Fish head curry that you must try, as well as pretty good Indian dishes like Masala Chicken.  Not cheap though and looking at the setting you might find it looks like a Coffeeshop and why the high ticket price. However, the service here is TOP-NOTCH, better than many restaurants I've been to. Attentive, constantly refilling your plate, these guys are hardworking
3
This place is at a very calm and pleasant place of Singapore!! Very important-if you are going to spend much time there! Inform them to give rice later! Else they will put banana leaf and start putting rice!! Very good for Nonveg eaters! Especially fish!! Nothing for veggies! Only rice dal, sambar and some veg curry!! No egg also!! Rice is average! But very very good to spend some time with friends and family!! Waiters there are very friendly and service is very very very good than 5 star hotels! Here people ask you whether it's good or not with courtesy and respect Do visit it once!!
4
The food here is good, and is served in the authentic way, on banana leaves. The great benefit of Samy's is that it is located away from Little India, which can be a bit mad. After your meal at Samy's, you can wander around Dempsey Village and enjoy a beer, some wine or excellent cocktails at the many, many good and modern places nearby. The area has a number of very pleasant places to drink after dinner. The entire enclave in is a leafy and non-urbanised setting, which is a really nice break from the gleaming city centre
4
When you want good old-school Indian food and don't want to struggle with the crowds in Little India, Samy's provides a civilized alternative. In the cool, leafy Dempsey Hill enclave, Samy's provides all that the likes of Banana Leaf Apolo, et al, provide - except with much better ambience, Going there after almost a decade, I had forgotten how good the food there was. Unlike the Banana Leaf alternatives in Little India where the standard rice-and-vegetable set is an afterthought, this place gives some thought to the vegetables as well. The chicken masala is every bit as good as Apolo, and the seafood dishes are great too
4
Samys is located in a colonial style building in Demsey hill. One has to go inside & select your food. We chose fried fish, curry tiger prawns (these were huge) chicken tikka & chicken malai. Rice & daal were served at the table. The food was delicious & price reasonable. Very good value for money. To add to this the overall atmosphere of eating in an old colonial type building was great. The kids really enjoyed the fact that we ate off banana leafs!!
4
I have been to Samy's many times in the past, but have not been there for more than 10 years. A few evenings ago, we went with a group of overseas friends. There were 11 of us.Apparently Samy's Curry is celebrating their 50th year in business. The original owner's son has taken over. The food and the ambience has remained the same. Only the tables and chairs are better.Instead of plates, banana leaves are placed in front of customers. Then a waiter dishes out a choice of either white rice, biryani rice or vegetarian biryani rice, on the banana leaf. Another waiter then dishes out cabbage dhal, cucumber salad and potato masala on the rice. And a third one distributes papadums (chickpea crackers). Next comes the best part. We ordered for everyone sambal prawn, masala chicken, curry mutton. These were placed beside the rice. Now the whole meal looks very appetising. We also ordered the restaurant's famous fish head curry, three tandoori pomfret (fish), and five naans (flat breads) to be shared by all. In the old days, many customers would eat with their hands. Nowadays less are likely to do so. Forks and spoons are provided. Remembering that tiny serviettes were provided in the past, we brought our own big ones and started to use them as bibs to protect our tops from curry stains. The waiter assigned to our table, Gandhi, on seeing this, brought out paper aprons, and went round tying those on us. Just as well. We were a bit messy. One of us spattered curry sauce on himself and some of us. Gandhi also served us individual portions of the fish head curry and the pomfret. The manager, Rajan, was also very helpful. He organised our long table, our 7 jugs of Tiger beer, 1 jug of Samy's Lime Juice, and wine glasses. We brought our own wine.The meal was tasty though a bit too spicy. We ordered yoghurt 'to damp down the fire on the tongue'. Beer also helped.The total bill came to about SGD$ 660. I had a hot cup of ginger tea at the end of the meal.Because of its 50th anniversary, Samy's gave us 11 vouchers worth SGD$ 110, valid until the end of the month. Definitely we will be going back with another bunch of friends.Business hours: Wednesdays to Mondays. Closed on Tuesdays.Lunch: 11.30am - 3pm.Dinner: 6pm - 10pm. Cuisine: North and South Indian. Corkage for wine: SGD$ 15 per bottle.A jug of Tiger beer : SGD $ 25

While not the cheapest place to eat in Singapore the meals were fantastic. The meals were reasonably priced and came in at approx. $40 each.
4
A short cab ride from Orchard Road and you have a fantastic array of Banana Leaf Curry to choose from. We enjoyed Chicken Tikka, Mutton, Large King prawns, Squid, Vegetables, Fish Head in soup---all very good. A favourite with locals too.
4
Good value for money restaurant, considering the location. Surprise find on this visit was squid in black sauce, looked dull but was excellent in taste as well as texture.

For pictures and complete review, please visit: http://theyummyyak.wordpress.com/2013/09/25/samys-curry/Dempsey, an area obviously developed without any consideration for the needs of those without cars, has an uppity vibe that I'm not fond of. Which is why the interior of Samy's - well ventilated and unpretentious - came as a surprise. A quick scan of the menu revealed that prices were reasonable, so that gave us free rein to do that overordering thing. The two of us opted for briyani over white rice (duh), one fish head curry turned into three protein-based dishes, and of course we had to get a coconut each to quell the spicy.Briyani Rice, $3.60 - The chickpea-laden basmati rice, tinted yellow and orange with saffron, was fluffy and smelt of star anise and lemongrass. It was good, especially with the creamy dal and lightly spiced fried potatoes, but just shy of brilliant. Still, I was glad I had it on hand to combat the eye-watering spiciness of the fish head curry.Fish Head Curry, $20.00 for a small portion - A concoction of chilli powder, tamarind, mustard seeds and other spices, the spiciness of this powdery curry was of the eye-watering, airway-clogging variety. Tomatoes were used for thickening the consistency of the gravy and gave it a slight tang. The curry also contained hints of the sweetness of angkoli (the colloquial term in this region for red snapper) used.As the dish was served steaming hot and the curry had numbed my tongue, I wasn't sure how the fish actually tasted at first. Having been cooked together with the curry, the fish head here was less tender than what one would find in a typical Chinese fish head curry, where the fish head is steamed first before ladling the curry on top. It was only when the curry had cooled down to near-room temperature that we detected a slightly fishy odour when eating the flesh, which indicated that the angkoli used here wasn't all that fresh.Mysore Mutton (dry), $10 for small portion - Although it shouldn't be a good thing, we were quite relieved when the serving of Mysore mutton turned out to be tiny. Our opinions on this dish were divided. My friend complained that the mutton was dry and tough. I have to agree that the meat could be more tender, but I really enjoyed the aromatic dry curry paste that the mutton had been cloaked in. Consisting of mutton stock fried with (what else but) a whole load of spices and herbs, including powdered turmeric, coriander, fenugreek seeds, cardamom and chilli, the marinade was intense and permeated the mutton thoroughly, and the meat bore no trace of its signature gamey smell. Now I'm curious to try the wet version of this dish - perhaps that would solve the dryness problem?Masala Chicken, $5.00 a piece - What we could agree on was that the masala chicken here was outstanding. Marinated with - you guessed it - too many spices to list, the chicken here was moist and flavourful. There were notes of paprika, garlic, ginger, tomato, cumin, and curry leaves. Flavourful might be putting it lightly; this was a flavour-bomb and an absolute marvel. We threw caution (along with our distended bellies) to the wind and scraped all the meat off the bones.Judging from the numerous tourists we saw in the restaurant, Samy's Curry is the place to go if you're looking to give your foreign friends a 101 on Indian cuisine. Service is quick without being brusque, and the food's above average. You can pop by one of the neighbouring establishments for after-meal drinks as well

This time I followed the advice of the Lovely Planet guidebook.I was looking at visiting Dempsey Hill but was not tempted by most of the place. The Guidebook however was citing Samy's as an old simple indian restaurant, with cheap but good food.And that's indeed what I found :-)The place is a little bit less visible than most restaurants in the area, but has a small terrace and a huge indoor place, with lots of long tables and a few round tables.You enter, and a waiter takes you through the menu (most is already prepared and ready to be put on a plate for you) A huge choice available, also including crabs and others.Service is very quick and efficient. A big leaf is put in front of you, and you are being served what you ordered on this leaf, and waiters come and offer you different vegetables, curry sauces for the rice, nan bread, etc... My tip: add the pumpkin :-
3
This could be a very unique Indian restaurant, unfortunately it seems that the staff and management don't think much of their customers and can be treated with disdain and contempt. This is a very old establishment built on the original owner (fathers) reputation and hard work. Please don't get me wrong, the food is good, but their is just something missing which could make your eating experience here so much better. It oh also do with a very good clean
4
Having lived in Singapore for decades, this is a firm family favourite for a Singapore Sunday lunch. Classic Southern Indian dishes served on banana leaves, in an old Colonial building in Dempsey, historically British Military and subsequently the Civil Service of Singapore Recreation Club.Whilst the opening up of Dempsey has lead to the establishment of many wonderful restaurants in this area, Samy's now has to compete with the massive increase in rents, leading to costs being passed on to customers.|Still a wonderful experience - good food, ceiling fans (plus an air conditioned back room that doesn't really do it for us).Great curry, a couple of Tigers and that's me set for a Sunday afternoon
4
The environment in this very big restaurant was good and the waiters attentive. It was distinctive to me because of the palm leaf that substituted for a plate and the food just went on top of this leaf. I did wonder more than once how hygenic this was and if these leaves were washed and re-used but i have confidence in the Singapore Health Authorities to ensure that this was indeed clean! The food was good with a good mixture of different curries and the lime and mango juice was great! My colleagues thought it was a little on the pricey side at $420 for 12 of us but it didn't seem very much more expensive than lunch
5
As far as good curry goes there is quite a bit on offer in Singapore and it's mostly centered around Little India. Samy's, however, is a little way away in Dempsey Hill but don't let that stop you from taking the time to visit as the food is excellent and one of the best curry experiences I have had. I was a little surprised to see some of the dishes already cooked and awaiting selection at a buffet style setup but that didn't take the shine off the quality of the experience as knowing good curries aren't cooked in short periods of time it kind of made sense. The problem was, seeing the food meant we picked too much and couldn't finish it all! The masala chicken was our favourite closely followed by the mutton curry and sambal prawns but we really couldn't any of the dishes, even the vegetable ones that come to every table and the wonderful biryani rice.I highly recommend making a visit to Samy's. The friendly and helpful staff complimented the great food resulting in a wonderful experience that guarantees we will visit each time we are in Singapore
4
I ate at Samy's two weeks ago. The Fishhead Curry and Mysore Mutton are the specialities of the restaurant. Set in a colonial-style building that was a military establishment many years ago, Samy's serves excellent food that seems to be derived from South Indian, Malaysian and Chinese cuisines. Moderately priced and very informal, I would recommend it to those visiting Singapore
5
I love Samy's Curry. To my opinion this is the best South Indian Restaurant in Singapore. I love the food and enjoy every time eating at Samy's!
5
Spacious restaurant on Dempsey Hill, good value, curry crab is great, as well as the masala chicken an d must try the 'rasam' a spciy drink / appetiser that goes with the meal...only for seasoned curry eaters though....!!!
5
divine curry, black sotong stew, you eat with your fingers off a banana leaf. not fancy, but real! reasonably priced
5
SLOW cooked Indian food is one of the joys of life! The spices meld into a glorious harmony of tastes. This is well worth a visit. It is simple with the food served on banana leaves. this is what we LOVE! Give it a try it is a great experience
4
Everything basically served family style with people constantly walking around similar to a dimsum restaurant except its indian and you're eating of a banana leaf :-) yep that's right a banana leaf and forget cutlery its time to eat with your hands (just kidding they will give you cutlery if you ask nicely
4
We tried this place due to Anthony Bourdain's visit on layover, but no one seemed to remember him. Excellent setting just a bit off the beaten path. Daunting at first as there are no menus., and waiter seemed a bit put out to explain things to us. Forgo the large prawns not good flavour and too messy, not worth the price. Be careful how you order, we asked for small plates but since there were 2 of us they put 2 portions into each platter making our bill double what we thought and a shock to the pocket book So make sure if you want to try several things ask for a $4 portion. Tikka chicken was good, korma chicken has nice Kashmir flavour. Dahl very good. The manager does an excellent job. Make sure you sit in the main dining or outside for the local flair. Finish with the masala tea(chai to westerners) to ease the digestive system
4
Just returned from Samys having eaten a great selection of food served up on a banana leaf. A bit confusing to start with on how and what to order, you go up to the counter with a waiter who taps your order into his mobile phone lookalike app! Then you sit back down and the food arrives. Either eat with your hands or you are given a knife and fork! Don't wear a white top though! (Although I am a messy eater generally!) great food, and the staff are helpful
4
For a brilliant experience eating outdoors or indoor from a banana leaf with as much variations of curry, then look no further than Samys On Dempseys Hill Singapore. Your eyes will be bigger than your belly.Take a seat, but don't got too comfortable as you will be taken to the selection counter to pick from the many different dishes available. Once done, you will go back to your seat, and the starters and poppadoms are brought. Be carefully to take your time or else you will hit the wall very fast and miss out on some real taste Indian dishes. Full of fragrance. Garlic Nan is a favourite.Hope you enjoy
4
The banana leaf on the table should have been a sign on how good this was going to be. Bowls of chcken and goat curry, rice dishes, and lots of napkins finished it off. A great Bourdain recomendation in a great location. Lots of shops and restaurants in the area....high end
3
This is a huge restaurant at a prime location with a large terrace and two separate indoor-areas without aircon. Surrounded by a lot of trees, you can expect a beautiful relaxing surrounding. I would strongly recommend to sit outside on the terrace. Inside this restaurant has the charm of a train station. Without any doubt this place is "special". Not just the fact that you eat on a banana leaf, but also the fact that they don't have a menu and really focus on a few dishes they are good at. The food is yummy, although not the best Indian food I've ever had. Everything seems to be prepared in advance, which is why the food arrives at your table within minutes. If you prefer "freshly prepared" food, this might be the wrong place for you.The evening we were there, we could hardly see any Indians actually. The audience is split into 50% Singaporeans and 50% western people. Since this is not a posh stylish restaurant, but rather a down-to-the-earth place, I think the prices are too high. We had the curry fish head, the chicken masala and a small BBQ fish and payed around 70 SGD for two people
4
Whenever we are in Singapore we have at least once dinner at Samy's. Although the interior is far away from being cozy (it reminds me of a waiting hall in a train station) the food is great. The service is attentive but not too charming. They'll place a banana leaf in front of you with a huge heap of rice on top, you go the buffet and choose what you like and they serve it to your table. Food is, as I said, brilliant but could be a bit hotter (I mean the temperature, not the lack of spices). Prices are average for Singapore. Try to get a table on the terrace. And tell your taxi driver that the entrance is from Holland Road, otherwise he'll never find it
5
At the end of our week, we went to Sammy's Curry as a work trip.This was my first banana leaf restaurant. They brought a banana leaf to your place and then just started bringing the food and placing it on my leaf. All of the food was excellent, but the butter chicken was my favorite. In talking with a local friend, he mentioned the quality was good but you can find less expensive options. Part of what you are paying for is the location in Dempsey Hill. I was happy to pay a little extra to get good service and excellent quality

My father is big fan of Fish Head Curry so someone referred us to Samy's Curry House on Dempsey Road. We were told Samy's is a famous Singapore institution revered for its Fish Head Curry ! We were group of 8.First of all, Samy's is no where near any public transportation so only way to get there is Taxi or private car. The area is very nice, in a wooded, grassy suburban area. You will find the restaurant clustered with a bunch of other eateries. We decided to sit in the Air conditioned Room as none of us were fans of the infamous Singapore humidity. Well, that turned out to be the first mistake. We ordered from seeing the display out in the front. This place does not have menus ! Don't ask me why. Anyway, we ordered pretty much a little bit of everything and of course my father asked for Fish Head Curry. The food is served on Coconut leaves. This was a first time for me. This is where the going goes down. Being in the A /C room poses one problem. None of the waiting staff show up. The system is you can have as much rice, vegetables and daal as you like as waiters go around and serve you but if there is no waiter and you have to get up from your seat every 5 minutes the fun goes out the window. Please be aware this place is not cheap. In fact, I found it very expensive. We decided to have Masala tea outside. thats when I realized we should have sat outside as all the waiters and restaurant owners were more involved. By the way, tea was great. Would I recommend this place - Hell No. I found it Highly overrated, wallowed in questionable hygiene standards, serving very average fare at high end prices.By the way, Did my dad like the Fish Head Curry ? He did. But we are not taking him back 
1
made a reservation, i'd read the reviews.Greeted very plainly. thought the table looked dirty.But, thinking this is singapore what could go wrong.I caught a flight home the next morning and ive been in bed since. As it was the last meal i had eaten ive put 2 + 2 together.Im a seasoned south east asian traveller and I certainly did not expect to be sick in Singapore.Singapore was just a 2 day stop over on the way home from a 4 week european trip.Beware
3
Samy's Curry is just okay. I expected a little more. The staff were not friendly. The seemed sort of bored. The food was more like something dished up at food court and the atmosphere similar. I suppose it is an 'experience' eating there. I wouldn't rush to return. It has been in existence for over 40 years so it must have a following - just not from me
5
Samys has been a Singapore established restaurant for over 40 years. This is a rare place in Singapore in so much as a group of people can eat out and drink without requiring a mortgage. I ate here with 4 colleagues and the first thing to understand is there is no menu. You arrive - choice, inside or outside. Once you are seated a banana leaf is put in front of you (Samy's has upgraded to include cutlery recently - this used to be when I first came here a hands only place...). Then you are served from a cooking pot whatever curry is on offer that day - usually mutton curry (excellent); chicken tikka; cauliflower etc etc All of the food is extremely tasty and more than enough to satiate. Further it is served with a smile and the guys make the experience fun. As an example 5 of us ate with 4 jugs of tiger for 229 SGD

I had heard about this place and was looking forward to trying their semi-famous fish head curry when a group of us came for lunch recently. The place resembles a school cafeteria which wasnt an issue for us since we werent looking for anything too fancy but after choosing somewhere to sit we were greeted by a waiter who was less than friendly asking if we wanted drinks. It was our first time there and since we werent given any menus we were a little unsure how everything worked however the waiter seemed to have zero interest in explaining anything. We ordered drinks and then walked to the bain-maries where it seemed all the dishes were on display. When we returned to the table our drinks were waiting for us and my 'iced-tea' turned out to be a milk based drink. When the waiter came over i politely asked for a regular ice-tea instead (i dont drink dairy) and was more than a little surprised when the waiter refused to replace it because "that is an iced-tea here and no-one else would drink it now". Apparently i should have known (without menus) that the correct way of ordering was "a black-tea with ice" rather than an iced-tea. The food was OK although it seemed unnecessarily oily and the flavours were pretty basic. The fish head curry itself wasnt bad but not presented as nice as others i had around singapore and didnt have much actual fish flesh in it. On the plus side the restaurant is situated in dempsey which is a nice area for showing tourists around and perhaps might be nicer at night time
1
I used to like coming to this place whenever I visit Singapore, but seems that it has deteriorated since the last time. The fish head curry was the saving grace, but everything else was so so. Service was slow and lazy. Had to call to be served many times.Buck up guys if you want to stay in the game
1
Entered full of excitement to eat here: one, because Indian food is one of my favorite cuisines and two, because my all time guru Anthony Bourdain ate here.Completely deflated, disappointed and depressed upon exit.No one to seat you, no one explaining how things work (we told the waiter who we had to beg for attention to order that we were first timers), and TWO. TWO dishes from the entire menu made without MSG. Everything prepped ahead of time, so nothing could have been made to order for me without MSG.Must have been 15 waiters on the floor, but not one interested in us.Only interest I got was on my way to the restroom, when a waiter shouted "Have you ordered yet?".Shame on those who say this is authentic. I´ve lived in India and this is no where near the graciousness in service nor quality in food that I ate on home terrotory.Anthony, I am saddened by your visit here. I hope you at least got paid big bucks by the owners for the endorsement

Given is location in Dempsey this restaurant doesn't have to try hard - and it doesn't. Menu as such, just an evening buffet consisting of about 10 meat and vegetable dishes, none of which looked appetizing or tasted good. All dishes, including the tandoori, are in a thick sauce. No biryani on offer, popodoms and naan were terrible. Drink menu is limited. It's definitely one of the worst Indian joints I've gone too (and I've gone to many in Singapore). There is no AC. It's popular only because of is location. A much better option is The Banana Leaf in Little India, better choice and tasty food.
4
The food is excellent in both quality and value. The service is good. The room feels a bit like like a cafeteria, but it's an old army building, which adds a touch of character. Well worth a visit.
4
Eat a range of curries off a banana leaf, fingers only or give up a get a fork. The fish head curry is good for four and the lime juice drink a great refreshing option.

Have eaten at Samy's twice before and remember it being much better than my latest experience.
Yellow rice was kinda bland, the tandoori chicken was hard, the squid was cold. On the plus side, the large prawns were good.
4
Noisy, busy, a beehive of activity from salivating diners at lunchtime - and no wonder - the food is delicious accompanied by a lime juice to wash it down - love it! Atmosphere conducive to an entertaining lunch! Try It!

Good food, in a very nice and trendy location with other restaurants and wine bars nearby.Their fish specailty is particularly good. Basic environment, so no need to dress up
4
No air con, no plates (except banana leaves) no menus, no prices look, choose enjoy or regret. Choices change but are generally similar Prawns excellent and huge, fish head curry excellent, chicken good. Korma dishes bland. Expect a shovel of fried rice or whatever you choose to be loaded onto your banana leaf and expect to be messy. Picture of beer two pints of juices two ice creams and five eating total bill 136 dollars. Busy, bustling but plenty of indoor seating with fans everywhere. I know aircon would spoil the authentic nature of this very Indian eatery but we have all got used to it and I miss it. Will we return? Probably but not dressed in anything which I want to keep clean. I am a messy Indian eater when using my hand though knives and forks are offered

Went here with a friend at night after seeing it appear on layover with bourdain. Therefore my expecations may have been slightly inflated but I did not expect to be anywhere near as disappointed as i was. The curry was cold and dry (leftovers from afternoon no doubt as we went at night) and not spectacular considering the price you pay. You would get curries of similar quality in little india for 40% of the price you pay here and its not like the decor is amazing despite being located at dempsey. The naan they served us was flat out cold, hard, dry and tasteless, once again most definitely leftovers. The one redeeming feature of the place is probably the fishhead curry which in my considerable fishhead curry experience was quite delightful. It was the only dish that was served hot which although a welcome change from the cold crap that was the other dishes, should be expected.So to sum up, if you want good indian food at a cheaper price, go to little india. If you want overpriced indian food at dempsey, go to muthus and not samy

Nostalgia brings me back to this venue time and again. In the ever changing face of Singapore where in a month a huge building can cease to exist and sprout an even huger building in its place within a year and a half and restaurants can last a few months or exist for generations, it is comforting to note some things do not change.......much, or not yet anyway. Samy's has been around for a considerable time. A couple of generations at least and is set in the old army barracks in the Dempsey area. Parking in open lots in the sun or if you are lucky, under a tree for shade, ( this is strictly lunch time place for me) you proceed to climb a flight of steps that I swear gets higher and higher as the years go by.You come to a vast room where tables abound. Round ones, long ones for sharing small ones for romance?. Outside tables and veranda tables and there is even an air conditioned room at the back with more tables. One approaches the counter at the back where the food is and where you make your order. This is where and when the staff persuade you to have the special of the day "the tandoori pomfret" I think it was. As it was the year before and the year before that and come to think of it, so was it the year before when I did have it and it set me back S$25 for the most aneroxic fish I have come across in awhile. Or their signature dish, the fish head curry which is really very good especially if someone else is paying for it. Actually any creature that emerges from the sea tends to be fearfully expensive in this establishment. Except maybe the cuttlefish. My favourite is the 'hot' chicken and the lamb is tasty if not a little tough sometimes. So you have ordered and are seating on a canteen bench where upon huge banana leaves are plonked down in front of you with cutlery and someone comes with a couple of vegetables dishes in a stainless steel artefact with a ladle and slops it on your leaf . The rice comes next, yellow or white and this again is whacked onto your leaf. Your meats arrives next or fish in stainless steel containers or if you are having the fish head curry in an earthenware pot still bubbling away.The eating begins. This when you notice your neighbours have discarded their cutlery and opted for nature's own tools........ Their fingers! Yes, you read correctly. Their fingers. Presumably their right hand fingers if they are right handed and their left hand fingers if they are left handed. This is when someone shouts at you if you want a drink. Yes of course, iced fresh lime juice. Refreshing, cooling, delicious and sweetened with four tablespoons of syrup. You go back and eye the person who is playing with his food with his fingers and watch fascinated as he makes up little rice balls and hurls them into his open mouth and almost simultaneously plucks the flesh of his chicken thigh and shoots it straight into goal. You try not to be noticed as you watch wide eye for his next move.What is intriguing is that a lot of them are at it. Even the women. I have to admit, I tried it once. It dribbled down my chin, fell on my favourite Tommy Hillfiger shirt and ended in my breast pocket..... a bit of the rice and most of my face. Having said and done, this is a unique place which so far has retained an authenticity which becomes rarer and rarer. Already the waiters sport electronic pads to key in their orders where once upon a time it would be verbal and memorised. The taps and sinks where you retire after a meal to wash your mitts are all clean, modern and high tech. For what it is, the prices can be silly especially if you order lots of prawns, fish and crabs but you know, the place was buzzing and full so they are doing something right.I still will not be taking this gorgeous lady for our first date here though. Nostalgia or not

I have now eaten in Samy's on a few occasions and I have been under whelmed on every occasion by the quality of food on offer! There is the novelty element of eating off a banana leaf , however the dal was tasteless, the butter chicken bland and the mutton dish chewy. I did notice a lot of people had ordered the fish head curry and this is maybe the reason why diners come here because apart from the nan bread which was delicious, I would not go back for any other dish. The service in Samy's is good and it's a nice ambience only if you book a table outside as the inside of Samy's is like a works canteen. I don't think it's value for money and if you are looking for authentic Indian food take a trip to little India
4
Being a westerner, I was intimidated by the thought of overpowering spiciness, but my fears were put to rest after the first bite. The chicken was not too spicy, but full of flavor. The yellow rice was out of this world. The prawns were my favorite. Only thing lacking was the cleanliness
4
PRO:
~Value for money.
~Wide selection of drinks.
~For non-Asians, having a meal here is a cultural experience.
CON:
~Not airconditioned.
~Limited parking.

Samy's Curry was on our list after watching Anthony Bourdain eat there on TV. We literally ordered every single dish he tried on the show. The only dish we liked was the Fish Head curry. The rest was just mediocre. Maybe our expectations were too high. All the dishes other than fish head curry were already prepared and sitting behind the counter. Naan was cold. We had much better experience at Banana Leaf Apolo. We will not be returning
5
we had yummy curries, specialy the fish head curry and rice we all enjoyed till we finished it, the best lime juice i tasted that evevning , we like the spiceness flavor of the curry as i am indian i love the spiceness in the food, its a good place for a change to have spicy curries influenced with singapore spice
3
Excellent place for some curry (fish head curry) while visiting the Botanic Garden. The restaurant requires a bit of walking, but it sure worth it. The restaurant is authentic and it is definitely a dinning experience. There are bus stops very close by to the restaurant. We walked from the botanic Garden and it was doable.
1
The location is great. Hence my expectations were high.I came here with 3 friends of various local ethnicities who love Indian food. We unanimously agreed that the food was a big let down. Pricey place as its nestled in a very nice area. The variety was not much either.I came here as it was recommended by a friend. Sigh.... you can't believe everything others say :
5
I'll agree that it can get hot and crowded in here, service can be a challenge and the decor is not so charming.... but I'm going to still rate this an Excellent. Why? Because of the food. Served on a banana leaf - dal, a curry, rice - then whatever else you ordered from the counter. yum yum yum yum yum
4
Maybe he was having a bad day but our waiter could turn milk sour with a glance, a smile would have meant his face cracking. Taking that aside the place is well worth a visit. A large room with no air con but copius fans gneerating an old feel, tables looking a lot like a school dorm with food slopped onto a banana leaf in front of you. Pints of line jiuce are sold and you need them. I had lamb curry, chicken tikka and butter chicken, all good, rice was slow to come but the roti was all that was needed. I will certainly go again on future visits - miserable waiters don't put me off good food
5
We lived in Singapore for 3 years and the one thing we miss the most is Samy's. Back in Singapore for a holiday, Samy's was out first point of call after getting off the plane. It didn't disappoint. The masala chicken is a must as is the dried lamb
4
Taken here by Singaporean friends one of their favourite places . It was fun for me ,banana leaf on table they then bring rice a curry sauce , Dahl and potato curry , then the food you have chosen from the counter is delivered , I think as I did not go and view it , the friend ordered a chicken dish with a very spicy sauce ,tasty but to hot for me, the lamb was yummy dark and dry , supposed to be like this , really good , the fresh lime to drink was great

South Indian, hot, spicy food - what's not to like here?The ritual is, you order a tankard of lemonade (lime juice with water or sparkling soda, choose between the sweet or salty versions) or a tankard of beer (do try a Kingfisher or the local Tiger if you prefer). Then toodle off to wash your hands (you always wash your hands in a South Indian restaurant). The best seats are on the veranda outside the restaurant, and it's always full. They now have an airconditioned small room at the back of the restaurant since I was in Singapore last. If you can't handle the humidity, booking this might be useful.Food: it helps to view the offerings first, and specify if you can't handle too much heat. Don't order too much as the staff will bring along two to three other dishes for the table - veggies, lentils (called sambhar), apalam/papad (poppadums or lentil crisps !!), yogurt-cucumber salad, and perhaps a chutney. Refills of these are available so feel free to ask for more. The food is served at the table on freshly washed banana leaves - Wonderful concept for those of us who dislike the loading-unloading of dishwashers. When you're done with your meal, fold the banana leaf in half away from you - keeps the odd trickle from landing on your clothes.It was pouring when I first visited Samy's years ago, and I remember I asked for a hot steaming cup of teh halia (Malay for ginger tea. Teh tarik is milky tea, btw - it has Carnation milk from cans added to it). It was fabulous sitting outside under the fans with the huge trees and dense undergrowth out front. Another thing: it's always noisy, with the chatter of people. Don't expect starched linen - it's very casual, which sometimes causes disappointment for first-timers. Comfortable shoes would be ideal to walk off your meal, and Dempsey Hill has lots of eclectic choices in restaurants and sprawling furniture outlets to browse through

The curry fish head used to be very good. Alas time past and new chef must have taken over. Its not as tasty as it used to be, something is missing in the delicious curry fish head of yesteryear.
4
When that hankering for good South Indian curry hits me, it's off to Samy's Curry at Dempsey. been coming here for years and thankfully the quality has remained..though the prices have crept up. Still good value for money and try the Chicken Masala and the Mysore Mutton, if the Fishead is too 'norm' for you
4
Well this Is a very famous place for South Indian meal. Spacious place. Chicken masala lime juice and plain rice is my favorite here. Been here many times and the standard of the food remains same and Its worth visiting. Try the prawn masala, chicken 65, chicken masala, mysoor mutton. It's nice. Enjoy eating
4
Went to Sammy's this week on a friend's recommendation and I was very glad I did. Excellent Malaysian style chicken curry, attentive service, reasonable prices and a nice place to boot !The place has a really really buzzy feel. Super busy, hard to get a table. I agree with previous reviewers that it has a bit of a hawker feel but that was OK lah :
3
possibly because samy's has become well known through extensive publicity this place has become extremely expensive - four dollars for a fresh coconut (tourists might find this kind of price acceptable).coming to the food the south indian variety is reasonably good - the chicken masala, the standard vegetables and the curries etc but i would advise you to stay away from their naans and the palak paneer.these do not taste anywhere near the authenitic north indian fare. I am unsure what flour they use for their naans, but naans did not have body and were brittle. similarly the palak paneer tasted different. I am not sure whether they use a lot of green colouring to the extent that the paneer also appeared to be coloured light green. paneer in the real palk paneer dish should retain its original whitish colour but somehow things were somewhat mixed up somewhere to render the paneer coloured. it is also extremely pricey for the portion size.i can understand the pricing if this is a fine dining restaurant but fining dining ambience - this samy's is not.the staff however were polite, attentive and responsive to our additional needs like rice or curry top ups.
4
We arrived just before noon and the crowds. This gave us the chance to sit in the air-conditioned room at the back of the restaurant. Within 30 minutes Samy's was buzzing with customers. Although it is included in countless guidebooks and websites it is not only frequented by tourists. Quite the contrary! Three of us shared a medium Fish Head Curry which was more than enough on top of the other choices we each made. If you are nervous about selecting "any other Indian eatery" this is the place to try a broad selection of flavors
4
The food was very good (except dry chicken) and the staff friendly. They dropped something on my pants and really tried so much to make up for it, which i appreciated a lot. For three people we spent 100$ which is quite a lot for the almost hawkerlike experience. If i can bear the cost worthwhile to experience authentic indian foo

On a friend's recommendation, we had lunch at Samy's after a morning at the Botanical Garden (a $6 taxi ride from the Garden's Visitor Centre). If you haven't been here before, you need to know that the servers will come around with pots of food and show it to you. If you nod or say "OK" they will dish up a scoop of it on your banana leaf. We thought we had ordered lamb, so when the servers came around with two different kinds of lamb, we said "OK", not knowing that each scoop would be an additional cost. In fact, not getting a menu meant that we had no idea how much the food and drink were going to cost us. We ended up getting a lamb curry, spicy lamb, biriyani rice, chicken tikka masala, prawns (1 each - they were huge) and the dish we really came in for, the Fish Head Curry. We all agreed that we could have done without the spicy lamb and the chicken - they were both dry and mediocre. The prawns were good but as other reviewers have indicated they were expensive for what you got. The real star of the lunch was the Fish Head curry - it was really great. The entire meal cost us $120 Singapore Dollars for 3 people (including 1 beer and 3 lime juices). It was probably expensive compared to other restaurants of the same type, but Samy's was a fun experience and I'd go again; only the next time it would just be for the Fish Head curry and a mug of cold lime juice

There are kinds and kinds of Indian food. Samy's serves Indian food from the south of India-South Indian food.The basic meal at Samy's which is the rice, sambhar ( pulses which you eat with the rice)and the vegetables, is quite authentic and tasty. It is even served on the traditional banana peel. However when it comes to the non vegetarian i.e. the chicken ,mutton and crab etc,the food loses it authenticity and has a distinct Singaporean touch to it.The crab in specific is a disappointment as the meat is always just too too soft and has no texture. The chicken is quite tasty even though it's not really south Indian.I ended the meal with a cup of tea...yes that too was not the typical strong Indian brew but classic Singaporean.My tip: If you are looking to eat a great Indian meal, the tikka masala and curry kind, look for the very simple, on the sidewalk, Pakistani restaurants in the city that's real Indian cooking. I am not kidding )))
2
any other indian eatry can do better than them. food is very expensive and quality is not even there. I can easily go down little india and eat the same kind of food with only a fiction of $$$. is a shame if they keep publishise as thought they are the best india food in S'pore to the tourist.
4
A place for people who like hot and spicy food. It is a place where we bring people regularly for food.
4
Was an incredible curry but be warned - only eat on a friday night and NEVER before a flight... The food is excellent but the sauce so rich that it can overwhelm even a curry professional!
5
I go to Singapore 4-5 times a year. I always make it a point to visit Samy's Curry. I reserve an outside table and ask them to bring it on. The food and service are always good.
5
As we are from a multi racial society, curry is part of our lives. This smay curry lives up to his name but its price is also on the high side.
4
We went to Samy's for lunch on a friend's recommendation. We were shown to a table without a reservation and drinks orders were delivered promptly.Thw waiter then showed us the the cooking area where we chose our dishes. These were served on a banana leaf along with varous side dishes and more beer. It was one of the best curries I have had and the portions were very generous.Definitley recommend but arrive early if you have no booking as it quickly fills up
2
I came here with my work team and it was not fun. The food was not great compared to BLA and the service was lousy - not indifferent just rude. I missed the ubiquitous "market price" for the prawns in the menu and got ripped off. Not cheap, not good, just nasty. I feel violated just thinking about it.This place sucks
5
Went out to Samy's with my wife and mother-in-law having checked out all the curry places in Little India (knowing some already) and being singularly unimpressed with the 'fast food' / shabby atmospheres on offer. Nothing really remotely inviting there. Having read all the reviews of Samy's I was a little sceptical but we decided to take the taxi out there anyway - about 10 mins drive. Arriving I was impressed. A beautiful view and a beautiful setting for a meal. MUST sit outside the large dining hall - much nice view and atmosphere. The curries were great. I enjoyed the chicken masala curry the most, although we had a fish head curry and crab curry too - both of which were tasty. The accompanying rice and side curries dolloped onto our banana leaves went perfectly with it all as did a large glass of lime juice - all highly recommended. The bill was reasonable and the restaurant staff helped us to order a taxi home. Very nice night out - something a bit special for a once off in Singapore. Although I'd go back for sure with friends
4
It's been a hang out for years. Good food, though prices go up yearly. Avoid the prawns - overpriced... but regular stuff incl chicken tikka are good, and all served on classic banana leaf. Great for out of town visitors, set in the lush of the Dempsey area
4
This is a local eatery that has been around for ages, but has remained true to its banana-leaf experience. Large dollops of food are shovelled onto your banana leaf, once you have seated yourself. Through, there are better establishments out there today, but this one is still an icon.What they do need to do however, is not to rest on its laurels. It does need to improve its dining experience, if it is to stay relevant to the ever changing dynamics of the eating establishments here in the Dempsey area. Lots of competition is on the way..
3
I go to Samy at least once a week & i have notice that the portion are getting smaller. I took some guest last week & order a number of dishes that i shouldn't. The butter chicken dish is great but the chicken was shredded in small pcs & terrible. Their fried mutton portion also was small & we were charge for large & it was hard. Don't order their pomfret cause that little fish will cost you $20. I will still go there but will be careful on what i order
5
that its been around forever is testament to how good it is.. popular for its banana leaf plates finger utensils.
2
The restaurant is located in Dempsey Hill, which is a good location, but nothing encouraging about the restaurant and the much hyped food as such…disappointed infact. Highly recommended for a urgent changeover in quality of food and ambience. The food quality is ok, not recommended for a Indian foodlover. There are better places around S’pore for good Indian food. This place did not keep up to its expectation to me, think its over hyped
5
Samy's is my "must go to" restaurant whenever I visit Singapore. The fish head curry is to die for. Do not let the name turn you off. This is the best fish curry I have come across. The rest of the offerings are also very good, with differing amounts of spice to meet most tastes. The restaurant is an open bench seating, in an open air building (they do have a small air conditioned room at the back). They serve the food on large banana leaves, and dish out the food at the table onto the leaves. I recommend the lime juice with the dinner as this will cut some of the heat from the curries. Go hungry, as you will not be able to move afterwards - it is that good
5
This restaurant is hard to describe. You choose your food by looking at it behind a case. I got the Chicken Masala as well as the highly recommended Fish-Head Curry. Little did I know this was just the beginning, as suddenly a giant banana leaf was placed on the table, and lentils, a potato dish, an eggplant dish, rice, two kinds of bread...wow. Service was extraordinarily friendly and attentive. This is a don't-miss in Singapore
4
Samy is famous for its Fish Head Curry. For 1st timers do not let the word Fish Head put you off. You can get lots of fish meat plus a known fact that the meat from the fish cheeks are the best. The flavorful curry itself will make you ask for more of its yellow basmati rice
4
Was taken here by a few Singaporean friends. They said it was rated the #3 Indian restaurant in Singapore. The venue is nothing to look at. No air con. And if I were to pick my biggest complaint is that the menu was very limited. The waiter took us inside to see what they are serving. Then we pointed (after asking what the dishes were) and he pecked away at his handheld device. Service was very good. The food was very good. But #3 in Singapore?? Not so sure
5
I loved this place. No pretensions - just good fresh food. There's no menu - they just offer a range of curries available on the day and you choose what you'd like. When we went they had fish head curry, tikka, etc etc.The food is served on banana leaves - no messing about with plates.Good range of beers including a super-strength Kingfisher if you're that way inclined. Tiger on tap, served by the glass or by the jug for added conviviality.The place was buzzing when we went - and packed. Recommend booking a tableService was good and friendly. Very importantly for a softie Westener, they can turn down the curry heat to match the audience. This avoided any nasty surprises and allowed the flavours to shine through.And the price was excellent - one of the best value meals I've had in a long tim
4
While it is known for its fish head curry, the masala chicken is really the secret star of Samy's. Tasty with a good kick in the spicy department, this is worth downing lots of mugs of lime juice for. If you're visiting the Dempsey outlet, grab a table outside for better atmosphere
4
Samy's Curry is perhaps the best known Indian restaurant in Singapore. I lived in SG for 7 years and every time I went, it never failed to satisfy. I was especially partial to a Sunday lunchtime of chicken tikka, palak paneer, dry mutton, cauliflower. White rice, all on a banana leaf mat - one time I literally ate so fast and with so much glee that I had chest pains for 40 minutes. And I am only 28
4
Visited Samy's with my hubby earlier this month. Dempsey's Road is quite an interesting spot. This restaurant although quite empty when we arrived was still serving really good Indian food. The interior is full of wood tables, it's not very romantic or inspiring but very big...The waiters were very helpful ,took us up to the counter where you can choose your dishes, identified what each item was and answered spicy questions etc! Food was served on a banana leaf on your table! In addition to the rice, main dishes and naans we ordered vegetable side orders also appeared. The final bill was very very reasonable and the food very tasty! Definitely recommended. The waiters very helpfully ordered a taxi for us at the end and efficiently gave us the taxi number to make sure we got the right one at the bottom of the steps outside the restaurant. Its about a 15min taxi journey from Raffles Hotel...worth the visit if you like your Indian
4
This is a Singapore institution. Don't expect fancy tables and aircon, just great food. They bring the various dishes around to the table and you choose what you want. Great Indian food in a central location. It is just fans so dress casually.
4
We had high expectations for the fishhead curry, it was ok, but not great. Everything else we order was very tasty. Definitely not too spicy. Atmosphere was fun.
5
We ate lunch here on a rainy Singapore day. We sat outside under a fan, which cooled us off sufficiently.Order the lime juice - its a thirst quencher and an essential chaser to the hot curry. So much food, so little time. All served on a banana leaf. Great value and fantastic food
4
My Indian friends tell me this is not real Indian food but the casual setting, the banana leaf, the lemonade and serving at the table or choosing from the buffet creates a fun evening. Outside seating is a little more private but inside seating is fun. I love taking Singapore visitor's to Samy's
4
I did my fair of study and research on authentic local food and I kept running across Samy's Curry on Dempsey road so we had to give it a try. We took a cab from Shangri La on Orchard road and drive was short and we went through some nice areas. The restaurent is in an area called Dempsey Road with tons of other eateries. We knew that this restaurent wasn't a fancy 5 star type of establishment but was rather down to earth catering to all walks of life. We got a little table outside and when our fish head curry arrived along wth other foood we first looked at each other before trying it. I have to say this was first time for me and my wife to try a fish head curry but the taste was out of this world. Overall we were so glad we had gone to Samy's curry where locals go and can't wait until next time we're in Singapore. Good food and good pricing!
4
Although some may find it overtly priced, but I find its authenticity in the way they serve the dishes could get by with the price tag. I could taste traditional Indian food without having to buy an air ticket and worry about food poisoning. Worth it. A must go and try food place
5
I love to eat on the verandah at good old Samy's. Best masala chicken and dry mutton curry in Singapore and friendly Indian waiters. If you can score a verandah seat it is fabulous if it's raining or just rained, all the evening smells of the wet tropical plants. Can still imagine more laid back times.
4
You can know this place is an institution by the fact its packed with customers at 3pm ! The food is above average, the price is reasonable, the papadoms are great. With regards to the ‘Fish Head Curry’, I still prefer the version by ‘Muthu’s’ at Serangoon
4
Heard a lot about this place and finally went to check it out with a few friends, and I was delighted by its no non-sense Indian servers, who were quick and to the point. The food was authentic, and very well spiced. Casual atmosphere for a good Indian meal
5
We kept going back to this place and had the same thing - they will serve the food to your table and you simply choose what you want to eat. The taste has been consistent and we know what to expect when we come here. Make sure that you are very hungry and come before 3 pm for lunch (they close at 3 pm
4
If you love curry, you will love samy.
I love their food cause I love strong flavours food. So not for those who dislike strong flavours.
3
This place is okay. It could do with a makeover and the food is reasonable. The price reflects the quality. Unfortunately even though it is in Dempsey Hill, a great location, it doesn't stand out from the crowd other than its prominent signboard.
4
Not too expensive.
Food can be more spicy; not spicy enough.
5
I go here on every trip to Singapore. The curries are fantastic, eating on banana leafs is fantastic, the portions never ending - have a fresh lime juice with your meal.
4
We ordered and ate too much! the prawns, fish, rice and lime juice was wonderful. we also had cheese and garlic lans.....yum yum
4
When with colleagues and enjoyed the atmosphere and good service always with an "OK" ending by the boys . Price can be hefty especially if you go for prawn.
5
I've been going to Samy's since I was 3yo and still try to get there at least twice a month! It's simply a fantastic fantastic casual Southern Indian curry experience! I sometimes crave their food. When I left S'pore for Uni it was one of the things I missed the most! When I moved towards the East coast of S'pore I started going to Race Course Road (think Apollo Banana Leaf) - it just does not compare to good old Samys. I hope it stays around forever
1
Horrible, bad and oily food. Also very spicy. No price list shown before order. Went there with great expectations but came back highly dissapointed. As a person who knows indian food was cursing the time I decided to go there. Would not reccommend this place to anybody . They need to improve and be more professional
4
Sam's curry is the place to go - situated on Dempsey Road it is surrounded by great bars and restaurants playing hip dance music as well as live bands performing. The restaurant is open air (there is place to sit indoors but the outside patio is way better) and is a very casual basic setting, You grab a table and go inside and see what kind of chicken/fish/meat you would like served on your banana leaf (best bit - try eating with your fingers from a banana leaf that they serve your food on) I ordered lemonade and waited for the arrival of one of the best meals I had been craving since I last visited 3 years earlier. I was certainly not disappointed. They serve you right at your table, rice, chicken (or whatever meat you ordered) and dal. In addition they add some spicy chicken curry, but I was pleased that this trip to Samy's did not make my nose water...it was definitely tastier than I remember it, and less spicier. The spice used to be almost unbearable but now it was just right and I am the kind of person who can handle spice. They also serve poppadums as a starter and you can add whatever side you like. This was a great experience and i thoroughly recommend it
4
I write this as a local non-Indian Singaporean who visits Samy at least once a month. My taste probably veers slightly, but not overly so, towards spicy stuff.As one could see from the various reviews, this place attracts 1-star rating to 5-star rating. Why the variations in views? Even the opinions of my local Indian friends vary when asked about this place.I think it all comes down to varying expectations. So, it most important to ask yourself - when you decide to visit Samy for the first time, what are your expectations?First, the physical ambience. The location is unique. The area used to be army barracks and now converted mainly to restaurants and other F&B outlets. There's lots of greenery around. Parking is free. The restaurant is housed in a spacious high-ceiling army type of canteen. The main part is not air-conditioned but one does not feel the heat as the numerous fans and the high ceiling help in circulation of air. There is an inner section which is air-conditioned.There are also some tables and seats placed outside for those who want to eat al fresco. There is no price difference whether you sit in the air-conditioned or non-air-conditioned area. There are rectangular tables arranged in rows similar to canteen, and there are round tables with seats as well. On the whole, the physical environment is basic but well-kept and tidy.As for the food, the signature dish is the Indian fish-head curry which comes in small, medium and large sizes. There is also the usual spread of other meat dishes such as chicken, mutton, squid, prawns and fish. The food is served on a rectangular piece of banana leaf which is laid out in front of each customer. A waiter will come and give you generous portions of potato, vegetables and popadom (Indian fried cracker). Another waiter will place portions of either white or yellow rice on the leaf. Yet another waiter will come around with curry gravy to see if you wish to have that on your rice. The fish-head curry and other dishes that you have ordered will then be served. You can ask for extra and repeated servings of the potato, vegetables, papodom and rice at no extra cost. It is advisable to order some cold drinks such as lime juice or beer to help counter the spiciness of the food.After the main course, you can have fruits for dessert. You can also order hot drinks such as the local teh tarik (tea with milk).The service is generally efficient although you may need to wait a while to get the waiters' attention during busy times such as lunch-time. You can settle your bill in cash or by credit cards.I typically spend about fifty Singapore dollars for a meal for two consisting of a medium fish head curry, dried mutton and 2 glasses of lime juice.The crowd here is mainly a mixture of local office workers and expatriates. There are the occasional tourists but not too many of them.I personally like this place as it is relaxed and unpretentious. The food is reasonably priced and I have no complaints about the quality. Parking is free and not a hassle. Where time permits, after the meal, we can move on to another outlet in the Dempsey area, such as Ben & Jerry Ice-cream Parlour, nearby for desserts.In terms of setting, one cannot find another place in Singapore like Samy. I enjoy this place best when I am not in a rush and can go through my food and drinks leisurely.The restaurant is closed on Tuesdays

Great banana-leaf curry
3
Touch and go but the curries (esp fish head) are extremely spicy

Nice selection; pretty much the same as in India. Only fun when sitting outside, and first timers sometimes run away scared :)

not much of variety. food was cold except for the claypot curry. only plus was that the service was great.

My wife wanted to go there for quite some time as friends of ours use to go there. So we made our way there when we happened to be at Dempsey Hill and felt hungry.What can I say, I felt uneasy the moment we sat foot into the restaurant, it came across like a canteen, not like one of the fancy eating places one normally finds at Dempsey Hill. We found a table outside, inside it was too stuffy and too smelly. The food was quality-wise not outstanding and it could have also have been hot. I was badly surprised when I got the bill, price and quality do not get together at all. I would guess that one would get much better quality with a similar atmosphere at far less money at any food court in Singapore

An Indian restaurant that can't get it's Naan bread right has to be questioned. This restaurant was really poor. The food was terrible, the service mediocre and the atmosphere was non existent. I have never written a review before but the experience was so bad, I felt compelled to do it. I believe it was good in its time but that time has clearly gone

I wanted to visit the old parade grounds and barracks (my father was based here in the 50's/60's) but sadly many have been demolished now but our delay in SIngapore and recommendations from staff at flight Experience told me about Dempsey which used to be the old barracks. The old SAFRA mess hall is now a fantastic authentic curry house called Samy's - no menus but the waiters bring food to your tabela nd you say yes or no..quite a new experience for us! We tried the chicken curry (delicious!) and mutton (a first for me) - teh food was very good - tasty and plentiful - but to sit in the old mess hall (which looks unchanged I think) and to be in the middle of palm trees was just a fantastic experience.The staff were great - in fact - everyone we met on our unscheduled trip to Singapore we so kind and generous with their time and support. What a wonderful place it is

a must

Used to be much better, they are getting a bit tourist savy and try to put expensive food on your plate even when not wanted, be careful in large groups, food is excellent though, its still a must try...
3
The Claypot Curry fish head is not comsistent. Small one tatse better, masala chicken is good. Affordable pricing.
1
overrated and overpriced for that kind of quality
5

4
All I can say is mutton mysore! Fun place to take visitors.
3
The Marsala Chicken is really HOT HOT HOT!
4
i like the variety u get for a single meal
2
Its a big 'canteen' with international patrons. As mass cooking, the 'famous' curry fishhead not as nice / warm as its Katong Village branch.
4
excellent ambience, good food, fish sambal was awesome
4
Very spicy, quite shiok. Its fish head curry is really cheap compared to its other items which i wld say is quite pricey.
2
Quality drop somehow after recent reno. The one along Upper Bt Timah Rd better.
3
The taste and selection is average. Nothing to write home about.
4
One of my favourite places..MUST TRY: Fish head curry, potato begedel, deep fried cauliflower
2
not bad but one should avoid the mutton curry!
4
Great chicken. Nice briyani. Veggie dishes spicy and rich too!!
5
wonder what its like after the renovation
4
Nice spicy stuff. Prefer this to Muthu
3
Nice fish head curry. But no air-conditioning.
2
Overrated, not worth the expense and has decrepit fluorescent lighting at night. To be fair, it's hard to find Indian food with finesse, especially since nearly every restaurant is using prepackaged curry mixes. Good restaurants should easily come to mind whenever you're thinking of eating out - this one gives me feelings of revulsion when it is mentioned. Still, 2 stars, 'cos hey, it's curry, so slop it on and lap it up
4
Chicken masala is very good (and pretty spicy too). Mutton curry is very good too.
4
Love the fish head curry.
1
Expensive!
3
Good, affordable fish head curry and nice old world atmosphere.
4
Probably not as it once was, but as cheap as chips and a nice cuzza
4
to die for fishhead curry
3
overpriced..... but.......
2
Expensive and the waiters keep trying to put more food on your plate especially the more expensive items.
4
Unassuming setup, but serves great tasting curry.
1
Food ok, but poor service, even from lady manager.
4
One of my favourites. Fish head curry is sooooo hot & spicy but I love it. Questionable value sometimes but good food.
1
went there twice. tried the fish head curry but the fish wasn't fresh.
4
lurvvee the curry.. wat else..
4
Good Southern India style curry that has been a long time local favourite, especially with the old CMPB military camp folks and the civil servants. This has been at the same location which used to be the Civil Service club.
4
one word... YUMMY! parking can be a headache!
4
Great food but the staff can be a little pushy.
5
Yummy!!!
3
interesting curry joint that serves rice and dishes on banana leaf. one of the most delicious (and spicy) curry that i've tried so far. highly recommended for everyone.
3
Nice meal on a banana leaf. Watch out though..... the food is extremely spicy!

Situated in an old-time colonial building, Samy's gives a unique nostalgic view. Food is good, but a little too spicy for me.
