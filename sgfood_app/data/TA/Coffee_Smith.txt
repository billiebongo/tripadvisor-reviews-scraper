Really enjoyed my coffee here. Nice location in Orchard Central with good service. It's not the cheapest place but has a great selection of drinks and snacks. I was there early in the day so not very busy at the time, but am sure this changes in the afternoon as the shops get busy with patrons doing their stuff
