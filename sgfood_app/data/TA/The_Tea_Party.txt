I come here at least 4 times a month. Great pasta for a reasonable price.
Remember to up size your pasta tho. Servings a little small for guys.

Very reasonable prices. Long queue but so worth the wait! Their carbonara pasta is the bomb! Lots of bacon, mushrooms and chicken sausage. The cream sauce is so addictive!

Saw Tea Party after my visit to SAM, and decided to stop over for a quick lunch. The pasta was awesome at an affordable price of $4.80, it comes with a free drink too!

Ate a prawn aglio, fantastic price.
Will come again!

Good value for money. Decent pasta, though it can be inconsistent at times. You can let them know if you're a vegetarian, they'll clean the pan for you and replace the meat with mushrooms. Queue can be long during lunch and dinner time. The lady boss is very sweet and friendly

Stopped by the café after a visit to the National Museum of Singapore. Located in the Singapore Management University campus, with a line of museums in the vicinity, the café is an ideal spot to stop by for refreshments and rest in between museum visits. The café has reasonably priced breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner food. Its specialty, a popular choice among students is a standard set meal of a pasta of your choice, which comes with a chilled drink for $4.80. They have a range of baked bites such as scones, muffins and Singaporean local street food.It was lunch hour during the time we visited at 12pm, which was when students were having a lunch break, so it was quite crowded. We somehow managed to find a table in the café's outdoor seating. We waited 20minutes for our food to arrive. According to the students, the waiting time during off-peak hours is shorter, 5-12mins per order. I ordered the prawn aglio olio pasta (choice of cream based or tomato based sauce is optional). Ingredients were fresh and pasta was good too. Very good value for money.Definitely would visit again
