A completely good Ramen, good service and quick. I've had better but that's not being fair to Menya who seem to do a very good job. Recommended but not a destination restaurant.

I always go for the hot ramen and one day i decided to try their cold noodle. Delicious!
It was surprisingly good. And i went for it twice in a week and tried to make them at home.

Taste is alright. Nothing to write home about but the ramen portions are small. Service is quick and place is clean. If the servings can be increased, this place would be worth returning to.

Friend had ramen craving so we went into the newly open one at Takashimaya and found that it is Menya Musashi. Quite sometime did not have their ramen and found that the soup now is not as thick as my first few try. Not sure is it only the outlet at Takashimaya. I don’t really like the thicker version so this is good for me.

We eat at various Menya Mushashi venues every two months or so. They never fail in taste and consistency. The broth is exceptional and the slices of pork succulent. The cold tofu is a favorite side dish. We like using the tablet to order food. It is convenient. There are numerous ramen places in Singapore and we have been to Japan. MM comes the closest to authentic

dinner any where on a friday night is horrifying. my niece decided she wanted ramen so we came here. we were seated rather quickly upon arrival at 7pm. the restaurant was filling up. there is a wide variety on the menu - rather confusing to me. but it was rather interesting. many choices and sets to choose from. pricewise, it is reasonable. we each had a set which came with main, side and drink. average price is S$21 per person. the hot tea is nice. the service was pretty slow, probably cos they are short staffed. but all in all, not too bad, average

Quite a disappointing lunch experience. Ordered the eel and egg set and teriyaki salmon set. Asked for the teriyaki salmon set to be thoroughly cooked but was told that it was not possible as everything was meant to be half cooked. Besides the good that was served looked nothing like the photo in the menu. Felt a little cheated. The staff also kept coming to the table wanting to clear the plates though we have yet to finish the meal. The restaurant was half full so I do not understand the rush to clear

visited with my wife, expecting a true japanese ramen. We ordered two chashu ramen one black with wasabi noodle the other red with thin noodle. The taste was so so. Wasn't good, wasn't bad. Just ordinary ramen.For Korean,그냥 그래요. 그냥 평범한 라멘집이에요. 홍대에 있는 라멘집 보다 못합니다

Visited the restaurant for lunch today with an ex colleague and after just a few minutes from ordering we were served our orders! That was very fast for ramen haha... We ordered the Lunch Special that was $12.90 and it comes with a bowl of ramen with 3 different flavours, a side dish (I picked doku octopi) and glass of hoji cha.Even though serving for meat was rather sad, with only one slice of chashu, I guess the set meal price makes up for this lack. I ordered the white soup base with thin noodles. It also came with a sheet of seaweed, bamboo sprouts and half an onsen egg.The octopi was generous and the refillable hot hoji cha aromatic. Would return again. :

Ordered the snow crab special set and pan berry set. The former was extremely salty and the snow crab does not seem to have any sweetness in it . My guess it is not too fresh .The pan fried berry desert was a little better . The cappuccino which came with the set is a disgrace to the cappuccino word . There are many eateries at the basement of raffles place , I suggest you try the others unless you like your ramen to be very salty .

The place is not the fanciest and, to be honest we came in because it was becoming late and starting raining. And we had a very good suprise. These ramens are of the best I ate, the service is fast and the price is fair.

A great spot to stop for lunch while shopping at Raffles City. The noodle dishes offered were of good quality; springy noodles and delicious broth.
4
An enjoyable ramen (not the best but still good). Service was quick and friendly and the price appropriate. The pork was a little bland and the soup stock nothing to blow you mind but a pleasant meal all the same.

Having lunch with 2 colleagues before meeting. Place was clean and not noisy but a bit cramp. Staff were very attentive and firendly. We ordered 3 set lunch chi shu ramen. The ramen was average taste. Price was not expensive but good for lunch.

Its a bowl of ramen, after all and now there are so many in Singapore. Service is very good- prompt and courteous. Food is average

Love the variety of tasty ramen (black, white, red) and the flexibility to choose or add your own toppings. Love the delicious broth, egg and bamboo shoots especially, but char siew was average. Will return to try other items on the menu for sure.

We had a lovely tasty Japanese meal here, once we worked out (with the help of the staff) how to order from the electronic device on the table.The grilled salmon was lovely as was the chicken tonkatsu also the cold tofu with dressing. Not a posh place but the food and service were very good â€“ the place was air-conditioned as well

I ate lunch here today Mon 4 July. Straight in with no wait, order from the iPad on the wall very easy. Had lunch special, choose ramen, side and drink for $12.90. Had red base ramen and Gyoza. Ordered a beer as well, hit send and the beer arrived straight away and the food soon after. Tasty Gyoza and ramen. Great lunch!!

I took my two teenage granddaughters to lunch here one Sunday. The girls each had a bowl of spicey and plain noodles while I opted for an Aburi Chicken Rice set. The ramen was nothing special, and there was hardly any meat or other ingredients in the rather unappealing looking soup. The black soup, which was the spicey one, looked even less appetising. My chicken rice was alright and it was accompanied by a small bowl of meso soup and some greens.Service was efficient, but unfriendly and the place was really too cramped for you to enjoy your lunch
1
We ordered 2 bowls of spicy ramen - inedible. Broth taste like dishwater. We complained - and didn't eat more than a spoonful each. Was told that's how they make it and then proceeded to get really rude. Chicken side dish was also not cooked and bleeding. None of which they acknowledged - charged us full price, and a service charge. Total 50 bucks for food we couldn't and didn't eat. DON'T go to this restaurant!!!Plenty better in this town. Be

Visited their vivo city outlet, Average taste, not a fan of their tonkatsu ramen mixed with dried fish, their squid tentacles or kinda overcooked,.
4
Ramen is nice, affordable and tasty.
Not very packed, good for lunch.
Using a tablet to order meal is easy.
Paying at counter is too much a trouble.
Will revisit if I walked by.

We popped in here when trying to find somewhere to have lunch. You submit your order on a tablet which worked well. The food was good and worth having.

I am a ramen addict and will eat it anywhere. This is a nice little ramen chain and is good value. Nothing like a traditional ramen outlet in Tokyo but well worth a visit.

My husband and my daughter enjoyed what they ate
For me, it was quite different ... ok but not so good this soup with an egg
but we were in this shopping center .... and hungry

Great Ramen at an affordable price. The order is placed on iPads at your table and then delivered to your table. There is a Ramen suitable for all tastes. When we visited there was a promotion that you could up size to 600grm for free (not that I can imagine anyone eating that much!
4
Pros :+ Delicious Ramen.+ Quick to Serve.+ Awesome promotional (at the moment of writing, Jan 2016) free ramen upsize up to 600g, which make it a good value.+ Free Ocha.Cons :+ Waitress are not too friendly, they just let you check the ipad menu without too much care for the customer

Decided to try this place as was craving Ramen at raffles city. Both of us went for the black tora base which was supposed to be the best seller but was not as rich as Ippudo or Ramen Play which I think is better. Noodles were ok. Pork cuts however I enjoyed. For the price I would have expected bette

If you happen to be at raffles shopping centre and have no other option then maybe you can go. They shut at 10 pm sharp, last order at 945 and then they shut off AC etc! Overall v average best part of the meal was the cold seaweed salad and sushi. Ramen I can honestly make better!

We discovered this little restaurant across the road from Raffles in the shopping centre.It was quite different - order from iPad at the table and food appeared as if by magic - not quite.The food was very good venue was clean and service was attentive.Tables are small but adequate for 2.I am sure we did not understand a range of options but enjoyed our visit anywa
