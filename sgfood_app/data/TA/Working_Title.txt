Food was good, ambience was great for hanging out with friends and the place is family-friendly. Would be back to visit!
3
The meat really not great. One that you can probably get ready made in the supermarket. Size and presentation of the food ok. Service very slow
5
We used the entertainer voucher for this meal and made it very worth it. Without the gst service charge as an added bonus.
5
Decided to make a return visit within the same month because their food is really good, especially the burgers! They offer a wide variety of burgers/sandwiches on their lunch promotion, would highly recommend.
5
The atmosphere was great. The food was quite unique. It‚Äôs was my first experience to eat at a cafe. Good experience üëçüëç

Long list of burgers to choose from. You will be spoilt for choices. Portion wise is just nice for ladies but not too sure for guys. In any case, quality over quantity yea? Tried a burg with beef patty and another with duck slices. Patty is pretty good, but what makes the burg amazing is the add ons. Personal fav is the emmental (cheese). It melts perfectly on my patty will be back for sure

This coffee shop is definitely thriving off the sort of hipster coffee shop trend. It is a good place to stop and have a cup of coffee but nothing was too surprising. Food looked very good although I did not have the chance to try any

Last Saturday, I was happy to bring 3 friends coming from abroad to discover the atmosphere and the good burgers of Working Title. But this last experience was terrible: We waited 1 hour for the first 3 burgers and then again 30 minutes for the last one. But worst was the quality of the food: the meat of the Classic and the Holy Guacamole was disgusting as if it was processed meat. For the DARKWING DUCK there were very few duck meat and the potatoes inside was so hard that it could have broken a tooth. Quality has dramatically changed. I was ashamed for my friends. I used to go each semester in this restaurant. It's over now!!

Saw good reviews online and decided to try. Went just after 2pm and the cafe was packed, but most people had finished their food.Ordered a burger and one of their breakfast options (potato rosti, smoked salmon and poached eggs), and ended up regretting it.After 30 minutes the burger arrived. It was tasty, covered in cheese and barbecue sauce. We were told there was no cutlery available, and they'd pass some once it was available. Not sure if they wash it by hand or have a dishwasher, but the cafe was almost empty by that point so we were surprised they had nothing.A few minutes passed and the waitress ambled over to apologise that they had run out of eggs, and that they were going to buy some. By the time the food arrived, it was almost 3pm. Yummy, but not worth the long wait. Staff seemed so laid-back, it's no wonder they ran out of napkins, cutlery and eggs. A family seated nearby was also grumbling about the slow service
4
Love the sauces that they put into their burgers! Very unique!! However, can work on cleanliness. The water tasted weird and the cups and cutlery were dirty. There were weird stuff on top of my can drink too. Had to go to the sink to wash it off
3
we enjoyed the ambience here which was beside a hostel i think, however there was quite a strong cooking oil smell and the burger buns were quite "tough", close to hard. would not return unfortunately
3
Used entertainer 1 for 1 hence value for money. A tad expensive without 1 for 1. Burgers were decent and the beef did not really have the beefy taste. No gst and service charge.
4
2nd visit to the cafe, which serves really good but on a steep side in terms of cost, burgers. The sides were just alright.
4
The interior of the restaurant is nice and unique, but it's very small and stuffy and dark. There's plenty of burgers to choose frozen and they are quite good, very filling.
3
Just had a classic burger which was average in taste. The tomato ragu sauce was not needed.
The chicken wings were nice.
Friendly service.
4
Had a classic burger which I felt was just average, the patty was too dry and rough. Same for the dengerous burger. For the clsssic burger, the tomato sauce was unneccesary. My friend and I like the tater tots (hash brown). The interior was hipster and chill but a little dark. Service staffs were great and friendly.
3
We went there spontaneous for lunch. The staff is friendly but very slow. We ordered our food and it took ages until we got it.We had a bowl, which was quite nice and a sandwich, which I can‚Äòt recommend. The ciabatta was way too dry and hard. The toppings (avocado and root beet) were good and tasty. I also ordered an avocado shake with chocolate, but it was too sweet and too much chocolate for me, but thats just my taste.Overall the restaurant is bit too pricy for what they offer, the food was ok but nothing special.
3
I ate at working title around famous place haji lane in arab street, the place quite well known recently for tourist destination.Working title the place quite nice, the lead time between order and serve to customer is quite fast, they serve good culinary art also.With friends, i and my friends ordered burger menu, holy guacamole (photo), salmon pizza and french fries. We consider the taste were average good.However, as tourist we just felt the price too expensive
4
The cafe is one of those very evidently unconventional, hipster types, with menus made from cardboard paper, and side orders served in dimsum baskets. Charming decor, but rather dirty, sticky tables (perhaps prepare wet wipes before coming). The lighting was somehow very dim, even though it was in the day.Foodwise, the side orders come in generous servings so be prepared to share. Ribena wings (which suspiciously resemble CP chicken) are crispy and coated with reduced Ribena sauce, which makes for a yummy snack. Might want to unearth the sauce pooling at the bottom of the basket. Enjoyed the truffle tater tots sprinkled with parmesan, though the next time I visited, it changed to garlic tater tots. The desserts on display looked enticing though I didn't try them.Specialises in burgers (which are customisable), is halal, and has quite a selection of coffee and other beverages.I had apple juice and it was freshly juiced instead of being poured from a carton.There is wifi, a toilet at the back, and the cafe houses a hostel within its compounds.Overall the food is decent but a little pricey.There's more to be desired in the hygiene levels.3¬Ω - 4 stars

Went with 4 burger lovers and had high expectations. Unfortunately definitely did not live up to expectations. The food took a while to arrive, and side dishes were served before the mains so were cold when the main food arrived. The burgers are good but not excellent, and OVERPRICED. For the prices charged you would expect a better level of service, but we even had to go looking for napkins. Overall, disappointing.
4
The burgers were mostly $20. Portion was ok. For a small eater like me, I think it was quite pricey. But they had lots of variety and the waitress was nice.
1
The waiters are quite rude, the coffee is not good and the toilets not working and not clean.
Pick an other coffee shop in the street there are plenty of good ones!

I love a burger or two, i even own my own burger joint in Oslo. This place is very hip, very anti-modern and i liked it's style. The food was fantastic, me and my wife had a burger (mexican) with nacho chips, avacado and a sensational salsa verde. The burger was cooked to perfection, every element went together perfectly which is rare. The fries were light and crispy too. It had a nice amount of spice without taking over the palette.The only downsides would be the portion size is a little small for how much you're paying. 50% more fries and a dip would have made it nice. Overall i was extremely happy and will be back.

Visited for Sunday lunch or brunch.Staff didn't greet on entry .. just sit behind desk on her phone even it says please wait to be seated.Poor service - no glasses at water stand, waiter said he will give wifi password and disappeared for nearly ten minutes serving others and finally comes back and says wifi password on receipt we already have!Food took forever to arrive and one dish served 15 minutes before other dish. Avocados in the $20 burger was brown and fibrous . Couldn't eat it. Tortilla chips served alongside were stale . Meat patty was from frozen and processed . Pizza didn't turn up after 40minutes waiting ... Basically don't come here . So many other places to go with better food for money and better service .
1
Where to begin... I was seated with my friends at the back of the restaurant where I had a view of the outdoor area. I could a guy outside wiping his nose with his hands, which I thought was disgusting..... it was only when I went to order food that I saw he was the 'chef'. When I went to the counter the same 'chef' was standing and texting on his phone (with the plastic glove he used to touch food) he then continued preparing food, without washing his hands. I pointed this out to the lady at the counter and stated it was very unhygienic, she smiled and said she would tell him....but then proceeded to look at me. The other person who was preparing food in the kitchen was handling the rubbish bin, rather than using the food pedal and then handling food. Looking at this made my stomach turn. I ordered coffee which I deemed would be the safest option. I would have left but my friends had already ordered food and paid. When their orders came, the asparagus which was stated on the menu came as green beans and the sourdough bread came as brioche!! Hygiene standards are obviously not a priority at this establishment. Avoid this place if you value your stomach!

We're out quite early from our hostel to find a cafe around 11am. Not sure why on Sunday, cafes are open very late. Luckily this cafe has already open its business for the day. Quite a lot of choices. I had flat white. It was so good. Love the ambience
5
Started making it a habit to visit here everytime I'm in SG. Perfect mix of slightly frazzled, a bit disorganized, and super casual ambience, perfect for doing some reading, finishing some work, or catching up with friends. Great food, coffee, and dessert with an eclectic but low key no fuss doesn' try too hard crowd. Will be back
1
The presentation of all the food is nice. However, the quality of food is cheap materials packed in a nice presentation with an overpriced price tag.Ribena wings (8 drumlets @ $12) were actually CP fried chicken drizzled with ribena sauce.$20 for a burger was rather overpriced and the taste was not that wonderful.
5
Working Title is one of my all-time favourite places to go to sit down and do work on my laptop because it's just such a chill place, plus of course the food and coffee's good, and the wifi is reliable (and there are power outlets for my computer!) It's also situated near Haji Lane, giving me the perfect reason to go do some window shopping once I'm done

We stayed in the Shophouse hostel upstairs to this restaurant. One morning woke up late and it was already lunch time. When we came down, we were so hungry that decided to have lunch on the restaurant. We ordered a couple of burgers and they were good. We enjoyed them. But 22$ for a burger is really expensive, it is not a fancy place per say. If you are travelling on a budget, this is not the place for you. Overall, not bad.
4
The food was average however the portion was pretty generous. Especially the truffle tater tots. It is still worth a try. I love the vibrant atmosphere too.
5
Laid back little cafe in the Arab quarter. Try out the curly fries or the baby potatoes. Can also recommend the burgers and the shakes
4
A cute little cafe that has some great drinks and coffee, nice room out the back to chill out in on a hot day. If you are in the area it is a good stop, cool,clean and good service.
5
We went to this small cafe and had burgers for lunch. Great food and very friendly staff. A bit of a break from the typical local fare. Had the chicken with berry compote and it was delicious! The ice cream sandwiches were excellent, too!
4
My friends and I had some dinner there. We ordered burger, pasta and a soup. The food is very tasty and delicious. The place is like home. It means comfortable.
1
We had an awful experience here which I think you should know before coming to this restaurant. My wife made an online reservation through their website, outsourced to Quandoo.com, a restaurant reservation app. Table for 8, on 25 Jun at 6.30pm. She received a confirmation email from Quandoo. But when our friends arrived, the staff said there was no reservation and refused to seat them. He asked if we had made pre-orders because it is the Ramadan period. But we didn't know about this as it was not specified in the website nor did someone contact us to make a pre-order.All the while, this staff kept blaming the reservation system and refused to accommodate my friends. We haven't yet arrived at the restaurant so we sent a screen shot of the reservation email to our friends. And only when confronted with evidence that the reservation was actually made, did the staff reluctantly find a table for 8. No apologies. When we arrived, our friends had already placed their orders at the counter. They expected the other restaurants along Arab Street would not be accepting any more walk customers, so they chose to stay.We placed our orders and it took 30mins before it arrived. When it did, was unremarkable, the burger patties were much too dry, slightly burnt with a blackish crust. Overall, the meal was not worth the wait or the price.So in short, we're quite disappointed with our experience and would definitely not be returning, nor would we recommend you to go

The food and snacks looked superb on the website and we went with real high expectations. It was fully booked for Friday dinner so ended up with a seat outdoors. The Thai milk tea smoothie was really nice and fresh so was the Chocolate Banana smoothie ordered by my friend. Our 2nd round of Smoothie - Hoho Nana and Peaches & Cream ended up not as good as the 1st round. For food, ordered Ribena Wings, Satay Fries and Fit Bird burger- the snacks were nicely done and came piping not but the burger was average and not as good. Working Title is located among Kampong Glam Muslim area and there is a backpacker hostel upstairs. It is nice chill out place for Friday evenings but don't expect superb fare.

This place is a small chilled out caf√É¬©, with a young and vibrant atmosphere. The visual concept of the place is refreshing, with clipboards for menus and bare wooden tables.The menu boasts a variety of food in the American Diner breakfast foods, all super tasty! I especially recommend the desserts, which are heavenly - Reese's tart, Horlicks tart... Overall, this place offers a decent value for your money and I absolutely recommend it if you want to have a laid back meal in the area
5
I was walking around the Bug is area and wanted to eat, but didn't have a way to check tripadvisor. I walked past Working Title and thought the atmosphere and menu, on clip boards with funny names for its fare, was a good gamble. They have lunch sets that come with a drink that are reasonable. I had a chicken burger with bacon and siracha mayo and my mom had a holy guacamole burger. Both came with fries and drink and each were about $14. Mine was very tasty and the staff were very nice. You have to sit and grab a menu and when you decide what you want you go up and place your order at the counter.The cafe is located inside the lobby of a hostel
4
A little cafe with friendly and attentive staffs. Menu isn't that extensive, but the taste and quality of the food and drinks certainly makes up for it. Overall, a great place to hangout with your friends over a cuppa and "ribena wings". Order tea by the pot & just spend time with your loved ones
5
We had some excellent milk shakes, coffees and burgers at the working title. I enjoyed the interior design. A cool place for sure!
3
I only had a drink from this cafe, but I found the stuff to be friendly an accommodating. There is wifi and the service was quick - the iced cha latte was also extremely good!
3
Cakes were nice... sandwiches were so-so... The tuna melt was tasty, but marred by having a very nasty cheese slice slapped on top rather than using fresh cheese....
The chairs, furniture etc. are a bit grubby...
OK/average, but nothing special.
3
Wasn't healthy AT ALL and so many items on their menu was sold out...
Also, service took a long time, so it was lucky we had a good book on us and were not too hungry!
3
Had a dinner here as we were cafe hunting and thought we give this place a go. The ambiance is cosy, staff were friendly and it's generally has a very young and hip vibe to it. Unfortunately beneath all that vibe tho, the food wasn't too great. We had burgers, portobello mushrooms, truffle hash Browns, and fries. The baconator was the only one that helped salvage the food rating at this place, everything else disappointed us. So if you are here to hang out, just grab a coffee to enjoy the ambiance and chill, but have your meal somewhere else. With the prices they charge, I reckon you can get a nice meal down the street.
4
This place is absolutely great! You can play games, have some coffee or even catch up over brunch. Personally, I have not tried the food yet but it sure looks good and there's quite a variety too. The other day, I came by and decided to get the iced chocolate with caramel. It tastes soooo good! If you're a chocoholic, you will love this one

Working Title is very similar in appearance to a lot of the new shabby chic style cafes popping up in Singapore. They have a good menu that is quite vegetarian friendly - three veggie burger options in the same place is quite a rarity. It was a pity that they didn't have 2 out of 3! We had the Rosti burger (Double Rosti patty, sour cream, cheddar, tomato, onion, mesclun) that came with Fries, and a Toffee Nut Smoothie. The burger was quite nice, however the sour cream smothered the taste of the Rosti - as much as I love sour cream, here less would've been much more! The Fries were crisp and delicious. The Smoothie was more Toffee and no Peanut Butter - the only downer.The service is super friendly and prompt. I'd like to go back
4
I stayed at the Shophouse Social Hostel, so this was extra convenient. Really cool vibe. The coffees were great and good variety of food on the menu. The ice cream sandwiches were so good. Wi-Fi is good there, so I made it my work space duirng my visit in Singapore. Much better than a hotel :)Only request would be to open a touch earlier to grab a delicious coffee before setting out for the day, but that seems to be the case for lots of restaurants/cafes in Singapore. Thanks guys

My daughter and I loved the quirkiness of shopping in Haji St. This cafe was recommended for good coffee by a local. So we spoilt ourselves with our first cakes and coffee. It was all delicious. We enjoyed sitting outside watching the world go by. It was expensive but we still enjoyed the experience.
3
First impression of this place is the old school feel of this cafe, coupled with the quirky chairs and set-up. When I looked closer, this place is really dirty, floors are littered with food and tissues, chairs and tables are not wiped, the menu looks old and tattered. The only saving grace was the set lunch starting from 9.90 which was decent. The place had aircon too and it leaked when I was eating resulting in water splashing over my food and myself. Overall, not a good experience, there are so many cafes in the area and I'm sure there is a better one out ther
4
The cake here is really good. But unfortunately when we visited the cafe it was run out of coffee. What a shame but still the atmosphere is good. There is actually also hostel for backpackers too. Nice place to explore!
2
Had a nice strawberry tea with salmon and some greens.
The ambiance of the restaurant was great however the salad leaves were not fresh (they were brown) and my comments about the un-fresh food were ignored by the staff and laughed off.
4
We started walking on Arab St. and saw this interesting, cozy cafe. It has a quaint feel to it with great coffee, a nice selection of craft beer, pizza and some ice cream sandwiches. They also have an air conditioned patio.
3
This cafe has a nice vibe. Relaxed atmosphere and funky design. The menu has typical cafe options that you would expect, with sandwiches, burgers, salads, etc. Unfortunately it was served like comfort food you are too lazy to prepare after a big night out. I don't consider the square plastic cheese as real cheese, and canned tuna on huge white buns is not a tuna melt. Disappointed in the sandwich, but saw other guests having the big breakfast which looked pretty decent
3
Working Title Cafe, despite its name, is not situated in a business district, but along the idling Arab Street. It offers a wide selection of boutique bottled beer in addition to the usual cafe menu. You get to pick your beer off the display rack and bring it to the counter to exchange for a chilled one. The coffee was reasonably good. Sweet offerings were quite limited as they ran out of our choice when we visited the place late afternoon. The crowd was very casual and lazy. We felt relaxed and comfortable enough to chat for hours. However, we did have a issue with the ventilation in the cafe as we smelled of deep fry cooking after our visit. Overall, the cafe is casual for a chat with old & new friends. For tourists, it is an ideal rest place while exploring the Arab Street/ Bali Lane/ Bugis area
1
On the outside it looked like a cool little place that you'd find in Melbourne. The tables were cool and funky, the vibe also, but the service and food, not so much. My friend ordered a tuna melt, which looked like piece of plastic melted on some orange cat food, arriving 15 minutes after we sat down. Some 25 minutes later, my pizza arrived, which was ok, but not worth the long wait, or cost. The place smelled like a deep fryer (not the right exhaust system) and the service staff were more interested in a gossip than clearing up the restaurant when people left. So we sat and ate our food, tightly nestled in tables that had dirty dishes and muck left on them, charming. It was a very average experience, even in Singapore standards
4
The Working Title is located at The Social Hostel itself, thus serving a lot of its guests breakfast in the mornings, and other backpackers looking for a place to chill / take a break. Its casually tasteful, hipster-style interior is inviting, and while there isnt much service, the cafe is relatively comfortable in its own right.The back door leads to a small yard area where the grounds are lush green patches of "grass", with more tables and chairs, emulating the feel of dining on the lawn or gardens. How lovely, and if one didn't step into the back, one would not have discovered this hidden find.I did not take the usual beverages toady - I settled for a Chai Latte (SGD5.50) instead. Fooled by its plain appearance, I took a very tentative sip, and to my surprise it was very delicious. The "chai" flavor was not overpowering, but blended very well into the sweet milky coffee. The cocoa powder on top was a plus point. I enjoyed this so much I ordered one more.My main course was the All Day Big Breakfast (SGD$14.90) - sunny side up eggs, bacon, tiny hash browns, rocket salad, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, sausages and English muffin. I waited a long time for this, and when it came I was surprised by the variety of items in this tray. Digging in confirmed my suspicions that the aroma (while cooking) was not deceptive of the quality of food in this tiny, simple cafe. All of that, for the price of merely SGD$14.90 - and tasted good (not salty) , now where else could one find such a homely treat?For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/07/brunch-at-working-title-cafe-bar.htm

The concept of the restaurant was very minimal and simple. Clean, however at the back room, there were quite a number of flies despite it being an air-conditioned room. Ordered truffle tater tots and a hot chocolate because most of the items on the menu were unavailable by late noon. Not sure whether it was due to high demand or just low supply (giving it a benefit of the doubt), but the place was quite empty (mind you, it was a weekday). Food was really bland, with no hint of truffle (as mentioned in the menu). Didn't manage to finish drinking my hot chocolate because a fly 'drowned' in it. Overall, it was a good place for catching up session with friends, but food-wise, don't even bother trying
3
Went there for coffee and cakes. There was an interesting "Grasshopper" cake, which was mint with chocolate, like an After Eight cake. Also various ice cream sandwiches with unusual flavours. The butterscotch and bacon ice cream sandwich was worth a try. Didn't like the fact that they were frying their foods just behind the counter - so left the shop with a slight oily smell
4
Something about this place caught my attention.... Was it just the youthful vibe, the decor, hipster and unpretentitious, easy seating area...it felt like a dorm or college cafe somewhere in australia with a touch of elegance in the decor.I had a nice aglio olio.. Simple, tasty fare and a couple of craft beers... Unfortunately, their housepoour hazelnut draft was down to its last drop. They serve very good expresso..had 2 of them.. Their hostel upstairs is a dorm with a tariff starting at sgd 25Nice dessert selection. Perfect starting point for a backpacker to commence the singapore discovery tour.Location is at the heart of kampong glam... Arab street , beautiful shop houses, Nice place to hang around solo as well and people watch over some coffee or beer
