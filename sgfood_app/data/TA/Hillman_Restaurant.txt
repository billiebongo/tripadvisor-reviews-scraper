Good food .... I liked paper chicken .... something new for me .... boneless chicken is fried inside the baking paper I Guess, so it contains the juices of the chicken.

I think everyone come for paper chicken. The other dish taste are just normal. If you want to try the paper chicken, you should come here. Other then that you must eat at nearest to your location.

The Hillman restaurants have a long and illustrious history. Their main restaurant was in Cantonment Road with a branch in Pasir Panjang Road. I used to frequent the Pasir Panjang outlet where dining was a very casual affair where you could turn up in t-shirt and thongs. And it was very cheap too.Somehow it disappeared from the dining scene and it was with great joy and anticipation when I find it has resurrected at Kitchener Road and decided to try it out.We had a late reservation and was delegated to the upstair space. It was packed to the roof with mostly Japanese/Korean patrons. Service was non-existent and wet had to wait more than 15 minutes for someone to come and take our order. Hillman has gone digital and the auntie who came to our table had a tablet ( which I doubt she knew how to use) to take our order.We chose their famous tofu, kangkong Balachan, beef in clay pot and a chilli crab. There was a long wait of up to 30 minutes between the dishes. We were so frustrated that we threatened to walk out after the first dish. Their excuse was it was a busy night - no apologies, no nothing. The serving was reasonable and all the dishes, except the chilli crab, were tasty. The chilli crab had very little and soft meat and the sauce lacked the ‘umph’. We quickly finished our meal and left, unhappy

6 of us decided to revisit Hillman after over 30 years, It has a long illustrious history. My folks used to take us to it's Cantonment Road location ( the original site is long gone after making way for the Pinnacle, Tanjong Pagar ). Hillman is reknowned for their claypots ..... their signature and popular claypots to this day is the fresh fish claypot and beef claypot .... as are the paper bag chicken. Other dishes to did not disappoint include their signature tofu dish, sharksfin omelette ( accompanied by fresh lettuce .... eaten like a sandwich ), deep fried group in black sauce. we were all well stuffed and contented with the portions served, and will most definitely return again soon

These people spend all their time taking orders on the phone. They stand there and ignore you. Even when you approach them they make it seem like you're interrupting them when its the caller that is interrupting you. After waiting for so long, they decided not to take our order saying they don't know what we're asking for (plain congee), after pointing it on the menu, they said they don't have time to make our order. Ridiculous, AVOID

The Hillman restaurant is a good experience if you look for good food this is one place near little India, all the food overall is very good, but one of the best is the paper chicken, tender, juicy and with a lot of flavor , mouth watering selection.Go and try never get disappointed and try the various pot dishesGood place not fancy but instead you have good food and service Enjo

My and I had dinner in Hillman Restaurant this evening for the first time. It is an excellent venue, comfortable and with delightful ambience. The food is of first class quality, superbly cooked and presented by very friendly and obliging staff.I recommend this restaurant most highly.Keith Manchester (Prof

If you want to impress your guests and show them how old a restaurant can be, this is the perfect place. On the 2nd floor, pasted on the wall are pictures of the 60s where the founder first set up his first stall. Just tell you how long this restaurant has been around

We were all looking forward to celebrate my mom's 80th birthday in Hillman based on reviews here in TripAdvisor but sadly, that evening turned bad. My sister went to the point of making reservations ahead of time even if I don't think I've read any mention of that need. We got our reservation allright but nobody told us that they have a 2nd floor and you have to walk a steep flight of stairs to get in. They only have a small signboard about it on the side and the person who took our reservation did not mention it. Unfortunately we had to wait for 1 hour. We did not have any other choice to look for another place at such short notice, affterwhich we had to contend ourselves to squeeze in a small table.Food is not really that great. The paper chicken is something worth trying but not worth queueing up for a 2nd time. We also ordered the roast pork with sea cucumber hotpot and it was good. The rest (2 different types of noodles, sweet and sour pork, soup) are nothing special that you would not get from singapore's food court. Service isn't that great either. We just ate because we were all so hungry that we could not wait to get out of that place after. Will definitely not go back there. Not worth it. I'm sure Singapore has more to offer so it would not be a loss to skip this place

Hungry one night walking down kitchner road, we chanced on this restaurant who were about to close. The waitress almost said closed but the Owner beckoned. We walked in gratefully. Mom wanted Veg food so we asked for soup and fried rice. we had made the orders when we were told that it would be too much! That was itself too much! The Waitress advising us to reduce the order so as not to waste!The saw why! The portion were huge. The food came is fast and we were surprised with the volume. The soup was good and the fish was good too. The beef noodles very tasty. But the fried rice not so.They were very courteous and ensured we saved on the costs but yet the taste left something to be desired.All in all an average rating

They have 2 floors. Look for the big signboard 喜临门 above the entrance. Must try: paper wrapped chicken, black sauce prawn, garlic Kang Kong, Sharks fin soup...

Celebrated Father's Day with family members. They loved the paper chicken so much that we had second helpings. Ate 30 packets of paper chicken among 7 pax.
Service is pretty good;

A must try - Chicken in the bag!
Other veg and chicken dishes are so-so.... I suggest a reservation because it can be full.

Paper Chicken, those delicious little of parcels of tender chicken booked along with herbs in a small paper bag, is a Singapore classic, as appealing at Black Pepper and Chilli Crab! If you fancy getting off the tourist beat, then definitely try Hillmans in Kitchener Road. Just a few dollar cab ride from the major hotels take you into this vibrant, iconic and historic area of Old Singapore. Definitely worth the trip and certainly work a try

Old but good homely atomophere. Service was no good but Paper chicken and other foods were yammy. It's worth to try. Reservation should be done weekend. We went to there sunday night without it but there was no table and needed to wait for 1 hour

This is my second visit, I've enjoyed the food but service standard has failed to impress. The prices are expensive too! On my previous visit, we reached at 10pm and therefore I thought the staff were tired since they're closing at 1030. This time round, we reached at 920pm and their staff attitude is just as bad. In conclusion, I would not recommend this restaurant as the staff attitude and price is a turn off

There is no question in my mind to say if you are going to enjoy Paper Chicken in Singapore, you want to visit Hillman. During the weekdays, this place has become so famous with Japanese clients, 80% or so are Japanese business people or housewives. If you go during the weeknd, you suddenly see so many locals enjoying the traditional Chinese food. Paper Chicken is the must menu for the first time visitors and it is so juicy. Local atmospher is very enjoyable

We had been to its other outlet Manhill @ Pasir Panjang Road, and thought we give the Hillman outlet a try. We only enjoyed the Pot Beef, and not the Claypot Noodles and the Claypot Sea Cucumber. The three items cost $44.00 in total. If you ask them to provide drinking water, they charge 30 cents per head. If you plan to going, do make a reservation. Valet parking is available but you can also park at the nearby City Square Mall across the street

We went there for dinner. By the first look of the restaurant, it looked very simple and not at all appealing. But the food is really very good. Their paper chicken is a must try, also their sour pork. i liked their mango pudding as well.Would recommend to book your table in advance as this place was full with all reserved tables...Must go...

We went here for lunch when we heard it was recommended by JTB (Japan tourist bureau) but we were so dissapointted mainly with the service there. My kids were sleeping when we got in. Most of the tables were empty and it was way past lunch time (2pm). No one greeted us when we got in so we sat ourselves at the bigger table. The moment the waitress (ethnic Indian) came to us. She told us to move to the smaller table. I firmly said no cos my kids need to lie down on 2 chairs. The 2nd waitress that came to us wasn't even a Singaporean, she was a waitress from China than spoke poor English and sounded very impolite. She said there is no drink menu and we just had to tell her what we want. I asked what do you have, she said beer, orange juice, lemon tea etc. so we ordered lemon tea and orange juice. We were so surprised they only have canned drinks. We ordered only 3 dishes to try it out. The Chinese waitress told us we ordered only 3 dishes which is not enough. I said it is enough for now and she just left. The food got to us which included their well known paper chicken and honestly it was just okay for us. It was really oily but I really didn't understand all this big hype about frying chicken covered with paper. That was quite a dissapointment. She asked if we wanted white rice. I said no need cos we already ordered fried rice. She just left again. We asked for the bill and was so surprised how it came out. There was no breakdown on the bill and just showed the total amount with tax and service charge. It was really expensive and even when we provided our 5% discount coupon, it was still very expensive. We ordered much more at another restaurant for almost half the price so were shocked. We settled the bill and just left. My conclusion. If this is the way they want to woo Japanese tourist which come a lot to this restaurant and give such ridiculous price and service, it's really pathetic. My wife and sister were really dissapointted with this place. One thing for sure, we will never come back to this restaurant and will never recommend this restaurant to our friends
