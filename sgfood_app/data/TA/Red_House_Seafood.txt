The restaurant is underrated. It serves really good food at a reasonable price for CNY lunch package. Fish was really fresh. No fishy smell at all. Overall a very great experience dining here. Will come back again in the future

There is a lunch promo for 20% of dim sum. Not bad, the truffle dumpling and crispy vermicelli were delicious.

i always enjoy Red house, and this outlet has improved significantly from when it first opened. The custard prawns always hit the spot.

Dim sum fared better than the seafood dishes. Price is reasonable with the 20% discount on dim sum even on public holiday. Pork ribs was on the expensive side for its mediocre taste.

Have been here 2 times. There is a great choice of crabs here in SIN, but this restaurant is the best in cooking and service. Comparing to Jumbo Seafood which is nearby, the service and interior much more better

Crab Meat Pao Fan was awesome. Ordered the large portion and did not regret, 2 Adults + 1 kid wiped it out. Highly recommended. Other dishes like roast chicken and Kai Lan were delicious too.

There was 4 of us. Had bamboo clams, sweet and sour grouper, chilli crab and pepper crab. Clams was fresh. Grouper tasty but should consider having a smaller sized option. Quality of crab big disappointment. Didnâ€™t look like 1kg sized and flesh was not firm and full.

we arrived late for our reservation, but the service staff was very friendly and helped us to get a table despite restaurant was very full that night. However, the dishes seems to be a tad overrated and quality is a bit lower than the one compared to the Robertson Quay. Location wise, it is definitely more convenient.

The food was not great and the staff was cleaning with a strong detergent on the floor while we were eating.
I won't visit there again!!

This is a value-for-money restaurant for unexpected big portion of food provided. The quality of food is acceptable but not outstanding.
4
Staff was nice enough to adjust the aircon, seeing that a couple of us were cold. Food was generally good.

first time going to red house seafood and the food there was excellent! seafood served were fresh.. Order crab cooked in the custard sauce ( fantastic and the taste was amazing!) the spicy seafood dish is a thumbs up! ask staff for recommendation! :)

Fried seafood is very strange and crab specialties is not so special, just a cooked crab then sent in sauce.
5
Excellent convenient location and nice atmosphere for dining. The food quality is better than Jumbo Seafood especially their Black Pepper Crabs. Serving is fast and staff are attentive.

The place was nice and quiet to bring a group of girlfriends over good food. Service staff was attentive to our needs.

Delicious. Excellent service. Value for money. Will be back again in future to try the recommended dim sum. Suitable to families and toddlers/babies.
My foreign friends enjoyed the food also.

I have to say the service was so so and when we asked the waiter to recommend some dishes he just pointed to the menu which was not very helpful and when we asked him what the portion sizes were he was not able to answer the query. The food was tasty but the portions were on the small side.
4
The service was attentive and friendly. The food was generally good but slightly pricier than I expected. Our party however had 2 people out of 7 that are not big seafood fans and the lack of a single non-seafood appetiser or soup is something I think the restaurant should address for its own sake - as there are always 1 or 2 people like this in larger groups
