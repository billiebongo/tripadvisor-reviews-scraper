Tried their promotion 1 for 1 main course with a couple of friends and all of us were happy.
Wide range of food, quality ok, portions big and che ap!!
The atmosphere is very casual and i recommend to go with friends on a budget.

Service was slow, food came in slow. It‚Äôs packed at night and there were only 2 waiters,and many people were complaining about the slow service of the food. Food was average and value for money because of the one for one promo.

Good food and great value. Always come here for dinner and lunch. Appreciate the friendly staff and yummy food.

So I went with a Chope reservation but the restaurant did not reserve a table for me but usher me to a random table. The food taste is terrible. This was such an embarrassing moment for a farewell dinner for an overseas colleague.

The place is quite spacious and quiet which I feel it is a good place for gathering as can chit chat after meal.

My friend and I went to Lenas Orchard Central on weekday. Recently there is a 1-1 good promotion from Monday - Thursday. Big portion, variety choices and nice ambience for casual dinning. Very nice service.

Very good ambience for gathering as the place is spacious. Service staffs are professional and polite.
The 1 for 1 promotion is really worth while

Service floor attitude was alright, everything is pretty much decent. We were there on Wednesday after work timing for dinner, there wasn't much crowd as such sufficient staffs.Starter we ordered Escargot, affordable pricing. Taste was alright but overly power by the garlic topping. So if you are mad for garlic, this will be the right dish for you.Smoked Duck pizza, honestly it taste pretty horrible. We felt frozen pizza from supermarket are better in taste and quality.Steak (Beef), can't recall which cut did we ordered but we specifically indicated to server we prefer medium rare. It did not arrive in medium rare, we informed server to send back to kitchen for their chef to have a look. Guess what? Chef insist it is medium rare. Some sort of feeling they are not willing to entertain even they made mistake.Will I return? Absolutely... NO! It is affordable dining but not cheap, so i rather no waste my time or money

I think there were not enough staff on that day but they ensured that every customer's call or request were met and they were still very polite despite them rushing about. Food was good too! With the 1 for 1 mains, it was definitely worth it

A comfortable eatery with helpful service staff. The lasagna was delicious with creamy sauce and a cheesy topping that was done just nice with the beefy sauce. Roast duck pizza had juicy pieces of roast duck and fresh veggies. A good deal especially with 1 for 1 mains

The staff were as pleasant and polite as always in Singapore. Service was competent and food was satisfactory, but nothing fantastic. Good enough to go again but just lacks atmosphere, althought his could be location related. No children's menu.

Went for a Sunday dinner with friends. Service was extremely slow, as a poor girl was working on the floor alone. They have huge hygiene issues - my beer glass arrived clean only on 4th!!!! attempt

Well, you still have pay for something but they were giving flyers and I saw they have 1 for main course and beer.I was at Orchard Gateway last Thursday searching for some dinner. Came across Outback restaurant where you can use OCBC Credit Card and get 20% off but then I saw this 1 for 1 deal at the neighbouring restaurant, Lenas. Of course they are smart enough of offer the free item as the one with the lower value.After some deliberation, my wife and I ordered a chicken and fish combo dinner and half slab of pork ribs. The chicken was better than the fish but it was the barbecue pork ribs that were fabulous. Note that for choosing the pork ribs for the 1 for 1 deal, you will have to pay $5 extra.You can also top up $5 to include a choice of dessert of up to $7.20 which we did. If you want something more than $7.20, you can top up the difference. We had the peanut butter ice cream and cookie and cream ice cream

I visited Lenas for third time, and at the peak of the dinner time around 7:30 pm the restaurant was almost full. It took more than 30 minutes before the food was on the table. I tried their Ribeye, and it tasted good. Before I have tried their Prime rib that is even better. Not the cheapest, but relative good food. Before when I have visited with less people in the restaurant the food have been presented much quicker. 30 minutes are far to long when you dine alone, and when no bread or other services are given during the waiting time

The menu covers a wide range of different cuisine, from Italian, Korean, Japanese to Western. There is also a huge selection of ice-creams, drinks and brownie presented in various ways. The atmosphere is relaxed and casual with diners of all ages. We went on a Friday and observed that the restaurant became busier at around 6:30 p.m. That's when the service started to slip: dishes were not cleared quickly and diners had to wait their turn to order

White wine seafood pasta at jus below $20 ! I love the restaurant that is easily access to anywhr in orchard gateway. The kitchen is transparent which I love cos I always like to see my chef preparing food and dessert. A restaurant not to be for lunch in town

This is the second time we went Lenas OG, after about a year. We are not a big fan of Ministry of Food, having dined in other outlets they have, hence it was more of a no-better-choice around that we had gone back.This time round, surprisingly we were rather impressed (perhaps because we don't have too high expectation) with the service and the food. The menu is rather extensive (typical of MOF's) and the taste is so-so. We ordered a white wine seafood pasta, Four Seasons pizza, a half rack prime ribs and a steak, with the latter 2 came with 2 sides (out of choices of 7-8) if you top up with a small amount. Out of these main courses, I would recommend the ribs which are grilled to a nice tender and not too much fats. Pasta has only a tinge of white wine flavour with few miserable pieces of mixed seafood while its four seasons pizza has one of its main ingredients missing - the artichokes. The steak was a tad too raw although we wanted it to be medium, which we need to send it back to the kitchen before it was more edible.Noteworthy is their service which I must say have improved from the previous time we experienced. A couple of the waitress/ waiter are particularly attentive which kind of make up for the less satisfaction in the food.On the whole, I wouldn't mind going back for its ribs and a place to relax if food is not the topmost priority

Since my last review we have been to Lena's in Orchard Gateway in Orchard Road several times and it has been great every time. The menu has a lot of variety and very good and anything we have ever ordered has always been available. They do not seem to have the black flies I had previously complained about. The staff are as helpful and courteous as before. Very friendly. This is one of our favourite restaurants that we keep going back to for dinner as a family. I highly recommend it as there is all types of foods for all tastes. They have been serving what they advertise on their menu so their menu is now accurate. Great thanks
