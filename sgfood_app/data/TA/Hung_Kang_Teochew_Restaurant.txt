My family celebrated my dad*s birthday in this award winning restaurant on 20 April 2017. It was a very joyful occasion as my dad is a teachew and all the dishese we ordered are his favourite. His loves to eat the steamed promphet as it is very fresh and tasty. Will recommend to all teochew families, relatives and friends

We went to this restaurant to celebrated my aunt's 80th birthday. We ordered their birthday menu. Their customer service is really good. They were very accommodating to our request to make some tweak to the menu at no extra charge and to arrange the tables in a manner that suit our party of 40. During the dinner, the service staff were very responsive. They provided us with extra small plates with fork after we ran out of paper plates to serve the birthday cake.The serving of the food was well paced. The suckling pig and the seasonal vegetables as well as the yam paste were very well done. Portion size is just right except for the noodles which was a very large portion. We had to tabao the noodles as it was impossible to finish it. Thks to Hung Kang for making it a memorable day for my family

Traditional teochew cuisine. Have been visiting this restaurant annually with the same group of friends for Teochew Yusheng for the last 15 years or so. Its Yusheng is quite unlike the others as there is no tossing of coloured radish or crackers, only mixing of raw fish with greens. Loved the suckling pig and the steamed fish as well as the orange infused yam dish.

I treated my friend there for birthday dinner after reading reasonably good reviews of this place. We took the set menu for 2 at $55 plus plus per person.Service was poor and waitress was rude.Then came the food, the shark's fin soup was just mediocre. The braised duck meat was dry and tough, could not even chew. Feedback to the waitress and she said nowadays the restaurant use frozen duck so the meat is like this. I was so shocked!The ngoh hiang (spiced meat rolls) were not up to standard of Teochew cuisine with much flour in the filling and the skin of the roll was not crispy.Then came the steamed pomfret. When the fish was placed onto the centre table ,we could smell a very fishy stench indicating that the fish was not fresh. When we tucked in ,the fish meat was dry and tough. The soup of the steamed fish was smelly and not fresh. Feedback to the waitress,she was very defensive and said why we ate if it was not fresh. I told her we have to try and confirm and it was a little piece we tried and we spat out. Then we asked her to change to a fresh one and she said all the pomfret are the same. Even if she give me a new one, it will still be like this first one. I was flabbergasted with her response. Then I asked her since all her fish is not fresh and we took a set menu, what can we change and she told me to change to radish omelette. This was an outright shortchange! I told her that was not fair,from steamed pomfret to radish omelette,what about oyster omelette and she said no. My friend then insisted that they should change to another pomfret and if it was still smelly, we would give up.I was glad that my friend did that. When the second pomfret came, it was much better and the fish meat was not dry and hard. It was also not so fishy but not tip top fresh as we could taste the Chinese wine. Teochew steamed pomfret should not have any taste of Chinese wine. Anyway, it was at least edible this time.Throughout all these. There was not a word of apology from the waitress or the captain. Very arrogant service staff. When she cleared the plate for the steamed fish, she told us you all no need dessert,right? As if chasing us off. In fact, they should make service recovery by offering g free dessert but told us we do not need dessert.I am a Teochew and this is really a downright horrible Teochew restaurant. It was my first time there and also my last. Avoid this restaurant at all cost or you will regret like me.I felt so bad to treat my friend to such awful birthday dinner and I had to apologize to her. Right after that, we went to Chui Huay Lim Teochew Restaurant for our yam paste dessert, the service and food were excellent and thousand times better

Went there with some old classmates and we ordered the birthday dinner for 10 persons and the food is really value for money. We had the birthday bun, the cold dish platter, sharkfin soup, a whole suckling pig, big fresh steam promfret, soft cabbage, crispy cereal prawns, noodles and finally yam and pumpkin paste with ginko nut for the price of $488 + without service charge. The food is very sumptuous and we really have a good time of eating and chatting

Felt like having some old school Teochew cuisine and decided to take my parents there for dinner. Everything were almost spot on except the or luah-oyster omelette .....We ordered the following:1. Mixed Prawn/Crab Rolls2. Teochew Stewed Vegetables3. Fried Teochew Kway Teow4. Steam Fish Tail- Teochew Style5. Or Luah6. Pig's Trotter Jelly7. Or NÃ©eEverything is prepared like the way I had when I was a kid and heard my parents saying they brought us here when we were young . Service is warmth and attentive . The only thing that fell short was the oyster omelette as it was too moist and salty.The rest was really good especially the fish. For a restaurant that started since 1962, nothing can go wrong for it to withstand competition..

This was THE Teochew restaurant in SINGAPORE years ago. The older Singaporeans still recall the restaurant and their special Teochew dishes: steamed pomfret, sweet yam paste, .... Not much has changed in the new location in North Canal Road; still near Hong Lim Park. This could be the reason that the patronage is not as ideal as some of the newly established Teochew restaurant. Both the quality and prices of food are acceptable. Currently the restaurant is having promotion for Birthday meal for ten persons, consisting nine dishes (including whole sucking pig) @ S$488+; which is quite a fair deal. Visit for Nostalgia or reasonable Teochew fare

restaurant was packed for a sun night, full house with every single table celebrating big milestones of the patriachs or matriachs.the place to go to for nostalgia. the taste and presentation of the dishes are fuss-free and traditionally teochew while incorporating the taste of the health conscious' less-oil, less-salt, less-sugar without the littlest compromise in taste. the set we had to celebrate the patriach's big-7O milestone had 8 dishes for $688 for a table of 10. everyone was too excited with the nostalgia and pacifying angry stomachs to create complete evidences for sharing.not forgetting the excellent service bestowed so generously and conscientiously upon us throughout the night

Our order was preceded by small cups of extremely strong oolong tea which is presented as Gonfu Cha. This thickly bittersweet concoction was also served at the end of the meal.A refreshing, crunchy, sweet sourish pickle presentation teased our palates whilst we waited for our order to be tabled.We had Sliced Duck Slivers braised in soya sauce. The delicate tender skin and aromatic blast - from being slowly braised in superior soya sauce, garlic and a secret hoard of spices .... makes it doubly yummy. This duck dish is, unlike most Chinese cooking styles, not oily. Next was the traditional "Or Luat" (Oyster Omelette) - Once a simple village dish, the Teochew have turned this into a sophisticated art of culinary finesse. Usually very oily by definition, our serving was, amazingly, not oily. Plump oysters, pan-fried with beaten eggs and tapioca flour. The fluffy egg result, topped with succulent oysters, is a burst of flavour. Remarkable.We also had braised leg of pork. Again, without oily concerns, the potpourri of sauces and spices gave the watery gravy top marks when glazed on plain steamed rice. Our deep fried Prawn Meat Balls and Liver Rolls came, magically, without traces of oil. Crazy.The food was comforting and satisfying. Great. (all the mentioned items are shown on photos attached to this reveiw).Service was intrusive and disconcerting. The wait staff hoovered over us as we dined. Intent on getting the name of one of our fellow diner who had organised group meals at the outlet recently.All told, it made their service look robotic and lacking in warmth. As expected, once they had the much 'sought after' name... they swarmed over us no more. Pathetic.If they were as dedicated as they seemed to be, though not customer oriented in the least, I would have thought they would have secured the very senior gentlemen's name etc.... at previous encounters. Sad

Wonderful Teochew meal enjoyment in Singapore. Oyster congee in authentic style. Vegetable with simple cooking but good taste. "Pig head dumpling" would be hard to reach nowadays.

We visited Hung Kang for a family birthday, and found the food absolutely fabulous and authentic. Service is good and all our favourites: cold crab, braised duck, hae cho, steamed pomfret, and, of course, yam paste, are still the best around after all these years.

I like my food with minimal salt. My taste buds were screaming salty, salty, salty when I drank the shark fin in chicken clear soup. We Teochew love to sip the clear broth in the steam promfret fish. Again, the enjoyment was spoilt by the excessive salt. The orh ngee was a big let down. My friends and I stopped eating after the second spoon

As a couple we visited the Hung Kang for the first time during our holiday in singapore since we were looking for Teochew cuisine which we enjoy. The person in charge took good care of our order and the food was served in a timely manner with appropriate explanation for a couple of Europeans who may not have looked as though we knew what we were doing. Food was delicious, ample and well balanced - the duck was most tender

This restaurant (housed in the Poh Heng Building) had been around for years. Went there as a child but somehow forgot it over the years. Rediscovered it in the past year. Great food and matching service. In an age when restaurants sprout up and wither after a few years, it is good to see an establishment stand the test of time. All the classic Teochew dishes are well executed.

Hung kang restaurant currently has a set menu for at least 2 pax at the price of $38.90 ++ per pax. Fo r 2 pax, you may choose one type of sharkfin or abalone soup, one type of fishes(which one of it is the famous steam promfret) and two selected dishes. Found the food was just average. It has lost its' authenticity comparing few years ago.

I had good memories of this restaurant that serves authentic and delicious Teochew cuisine. But no more. My recent trip to this restaurant has been disappointing, for example, the steam pomfret was bland and devoid of any taste at all, without the sourish flavours of the preserved plums, salted vegetables typical of a Teochew steam fish. The fish was also slightly over-cooked. The braised duck was equally disappointing - the Hollywood braised duck in Sims Drive Hawker Centre and the braised duck in Hong Lim are much better, and cheaper. The only saving grace was the yam paste, still as smooth and not too sweet

I have been to this restaurant regularly when I am in Singapore. This restaurant is situated in the fringe of Singapore Chinatown. A very good place to eat and then start your walking exploration of Singapore Chinatown to walk off the full stomach.I would recommend this restaurant to tourist wanting to sample good Teochew style food and explore Singapore Chinatown after.There are many 5 stars hotels; namely Swissotel Merchant Court near and around this restaurant

One of the few remaining Teochew restaurants that continues to serve great tasting authentic dishes at very reasonable prices in a central location. Their staff are warm and good with recommending seasonal delights. Set menus for birthday celebrations are good value for money and popular with their regulars

This restaurant is worth going to. The food is truly authentic in taste. Each dish has a home-cooked taste and feel to it. The Teochew siew mai is especially delicious, packed with meat and very little fat and flour. It is made fresh and served straight from the steamer.Desserts here are "so-so". Just go there for the food and go elsewhere for dessert
