The food is ranked averagely. But the service crew is very friendly. Food ordered are Pork belly + duck rice, soup, prawn Che Cheon Fun, Sao Bao and spring roll Che Cheong Fun.
4
Irish fattened ducks are roasted on site , hence fresh and moist.sweetened Roast pork also features. Rice or noodles and fried vegetables are good too. Prices are reasonable.

Ate at the London Fat Duck, our meal was amazing !! Was also very reasonable in price compared to similar restaurants nearby. Would recommend !!
1
A pure disappointment. The roasted duck skin is not crunchy and thus quite chewy. It ended up half of the serving, I had to leave it behind instead of into my stomach. The roasted pork belly, the first bite was ok. Then the second bite the meat is too hard. I m a food tasty. Definitely I have eaten much better ones. The Cheong Fun with roasted duck meat was a disaster. How can this dish be cold. Definitely not worth trying at all. Unable to eat this cold Cheong Fu

Last time din there jan 2016. Today we Order plain porridge, wanton noodle half aroast duck, duck tongue,pig ear, carrot cake, london duck pau, custard pau , spring roll, chicken feet total bill 90 plus.They have change most of the service staff. Food taste good, service also no bad
4
Heard about this restaurant from my daughter. So I had to really give it a try. Although it did not disappoint, it had not left an impression that I need to go back. Decent food. Had the trio-combo bbq combination. It was good enough and the vegetable was also good.Over-all, there is this chinese bbq restaurant over at bugis which has a better duck and char siu IMHO
2
The food in this restaurant was ok. The duck was good. The roast pork was ok. The carrot cake was soggy and tasted awful. The vegetable dishes and the carbs were all just ok.What was really bad about this restaurant was the service. The restaurant was understaffed and the waiters were simply overwhelmed. Some of them seemed very uninterested in serving the customers. I had to ask five times for rice and condiments. This needs to be improved
4
They live up to their Name. The duck meat is sure fat, juicy and tender. It might not be the best roasted duck ever but it is satisfying enough. Their other dishes are good too, like the roast pork, char siew which is on the fatter side which makes it softer. Service is quick and friendly too
2
When this duck outlet first opened, the queues were always very long. It was worth the wait. The roast duck was fabulous and remain consistently good for the longest time.But after a recent visit in July 2017 standards had seriously fallen. And not surprisingly, no queues in sight ! I am forgiving. I will give it one more chance ! Perhaps it was just a bad day for the chef. We shall see. Alan Leong Singapore
5
Whatever we ordered, everything taste delicious. When skimming the menu outside the door, we were intriqued with pig ear terrine. So we gave it a try and it does not disappoint. However, we ended up ordering two porridges, roasted pork, bbq pork, roasted duck, and radish cake. Ohhh so good. Will come back to taste the pig's ear terrine
5
First time to this outlet but was not a stranger as have visited the other outleta on several occassions. Food did not disappointed me as the quality and taste was exactly the same with the other outlet.
5
yummy as always.. nothing can beat the crunchiness and tender of fried duck here.. however they dont provide tissue as they will charge for wet tissue. so pls prepare to bring one.
4
Don't get confused with Hestons London fat duck - the food was good and obviously popular with locals when you see the long queue for takeaway. The decor is tired and a bit scruffy bu the food was good.
4
I was confused when I saw the signage. I was remembered of Heston's Fat Duck in London. In fact it's a Chinese restaurant, Hong Kong style. It has plenty menu, and I thinks it's quite alright.
3
Nothing great. Pricey. I still prefer Ding Xiao Er. We just gave this craze a chance and will not be coming back for it. There are a lot more cheaper choices with the same quality. If not, same price but better.
3
Duck was good.. the floor of the place is very slippery Becareful is walking in.. food was good the duck and the plum sauce goes very well.. but still abit pricey for me
4
Chanced on this in the basement of the high end mall after deciding $26 is too much to pay for a hot dog no matter how hipster the coffee shop is ! As a 'ang mo' local slang for a white guy I'm not an expert on dim sim & roast but you can taste the difference between here and equivalent or even more expensive places. London refers to the imported duck they use and it's a singapore restaurant rather than a franchise of a Hong Kong chain like some others.Overall well worth a try I recommend the pepper duck bau and the roast pork :
4
The place feels like a mall food court setup. The duck is delicious, the bbq pork belly is crunchy and taste great. Try the pressed pig year (appetizer, cold cut). It looks great sliced and tastes better than it looks.If you have a healthy appetite don't bother with anything less than half duck. It's not as big as it sounds.I was a bit disappointed with the duck tongue appetizer. It comes with the jaw bone attached.I understand this is an Asian restaurant but I thing they could use a few wines on the menu.Service is strange: different wait stuff stops by every once in a while, checks your order (which stays on the table), go away. One of the waitresses did that, then walked two tables away and stared at me while I was eating. I guess she was getting bored, it was late, place was almost empty
4
We were browsing and wanted to try this place as i wanted to try their roast items. Ordered the three combination, noodles and also some dim sum to try. The combination turn out very well especially the char siew as it had a mix of lean + fat meat on every piece(which is the way i liked my char siew). The black pepper duck bun was also tasty though the downside is that there is little filling (pic attached). The signature steam cheong fun was also good and inside the fritter, there was some prawn/fish paste which gave that food a different texture and taste. They kept the sauce and cheong fun separate instead of pouring the sauce on the cheongfun. Service is somewhat lacking and the staff mixed up our table orders with another's even though it was not full. The place is also pretty simple and felt similar to a crystal jade. Overall, i would probably want to try some of the other dishes to see if this could become a regular hangout
4
We tried the duck wanton noddle, black pepper bun, quarter duck, charsiew and other dimsum items. All was averagely okay, except for the YUMMY honey charsiew. The duck itself and black pepper bun was quite underwhelming but still nice nonetheless. Not a must return but still an option
5
The duck we ordered was perfect. Better tasting than the Peking duck. The staff was very attentive to us. We asked for additional condiments..it was brought to.ia in no time.
5
Excellent roast duck. That's what this restaurant is famous for. Located at the basement of the Scott Square.
4
Famous for its roast duck which comes from Ireland. Rather fat duck but you could easily separate the fat from the meat. Reasonably priced. Good range of other dishes typically Cantonese style food
4
Had dinner at the vivocity outlet. The duck with salted vegetable soup could have been subtler. Not that it wasn't tasty, but could have held back in the salt a little. Duck noodles was good- tender, succulent duck slices with springy noodles and blanched veges. Service was also not bad given that they were extremely busy during dinner time
3
Tasty no doubt. The duck and the xiao long bao were prepared well. My big concern was the duck serving size. Almost half the duck served was bone. Nothing much to eat. Disappointing. Would have rated it 2 of 5, but the xiao long bao saved the day. Somehow.
3
The decor was nothing great. We ordered the duck pancakes(1/2 a duck), xo fried rice with duck, yeong chow fried rice, hakkaw, prawn spring roles, kai Lan etc. the ladies serving were nice. The food was average for me. In a place like Singapore they really will need to turn up the game to survive. For me it was not a meal to remember
5
We were back there again at their outlet in Vivocity, this time for lunch. My friend was there ahead, so she took a table for 3 of us.Surprisingly, it wasn't too crowded for a weekday lunch. Service is as usual good and efficient.She has never tried it here, so we ordered our usual favorites, a quarter roast duck and some dim sum. She also wanted to try the other 2 meats, roast pork and char siew. Wow ! The char siew was moist, tender, succulent and tasty ! The roast pork too, n not too saltish ! She also agreed with our verdict of the London Fat roast duck : a ravishing delight.She even brought home the meats, which we couldn't finish. Her parents liked them so much, and said...Not enough for them. LOL.Will be back, to satisfy our craving for roast meats 
5
Fatty Char siew. Roast duck. Charcoal buns with peppery duck fillings. I am just going to recommend dishes to try because the food served at this restaurant is nothing short of amazing, my words would not do it sufficient justice. Your taste buds would thank me for it, I kid you not
4
My first visit has left a satisfying impression although the portion of duck served included a fair amount of boney bits. The meaty bits served did taste as good as the famous roast duck restaurant in Bayswater London. A side order of the water cress soup with pork ribs was decidedly flavoursome and the meat well cooked. I will return when I next fancy a London roast duck dinner
5
We were wondering why it's called Fat Duck, anyway we went to try it.We tried it at their outlet in Vivo City, basement 2. It was Fri evening, we were there slightly after 6 pm, and lucky to have seats right away.We ordered a quarter roast duck, har kao, siew mai and fu pi quan, and 2 porridge for 4 of us.The duck didn't disappoint, neither did the dim sum, which is by far the best we've tasted in a very long time here in Singapore. The price of the dim sum is the usual restaurant price, so it's really good
3
Average dimsum restaurant. The only dish i would recommend is Signature black pepper london duck bun. The London roast duck rice was also average too. For dessert, the mango puree with sago is good.
4
The concept of this restaurant is just like the typical Hong Kong style roasted cuisine. They import their ducks and these ducks are fat. Love the skin of these roasted ducks. They serve good roasted port and char siew too!
3
Roast Duck - Nothing special especially for $40 a duck.
I prefer the dim sum. Buns were very tasty. Reasonable and nice.
Service is poor - an older gentleman did all the work.
4
We went there at 330pm so there wasnt any queue. Ordered half a duck, it was excellent not dry just like how they do it in Beijing. Excellent duck
1
Tried this restaurant for the second time. First time it was when it had just opened and the experience was not good. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and put it down to the teething problems of a business at the start. So, now after some time I decided to give it another try. Bottom line, I shouldn't have done so. Nothing changed. It is still the same terrible food, indifferent service and expensive for what it is. You are certainly better off in every aspect to go to the nearest food court or hawker center
5
My table ordered half a duck. It was quite sizable. The roast duck is good. The gravy they pour on it the duck plus the plum sauce were delicious. I like duck and this ranks quite high up on my roast duck list. It is a bit on the fat side. The fat is very adherent to the meat and less so to the skin.The liver porridge was so-so. The pork cheong fun was good
3
We wanted a light lunch , hence ordered noodles with duck drum stick (extra $3), fish porridge and a bowl of wanton. Found the quality and taste of food average at most, but the duck drum was quite fatty in my opinion. However, some of the staff seemed to lack experience and worked at a snail's pace. They could improve on their professionalism and work pace. Prices are reasonable for it's Orchard location
1
Forget about trying to reserve a table for dinner. The service is useless and overwhelmed on tthe Saturday that we went. Despite making a reservation, no table was available when we got there. while one staff was clearing a table for us, another ushered a different group to the table and ifnored our protests that we had a reservation. In the end we left since the staff werent even interested in making any attempt to accomodate us. I wont even rate this restaurant a one but the app wont let me
2
I was by myself, hungry, and only had a short time to eat, so decided to order 2 items for takeout from the dim sum menu. Half an hour later, I was still waiting. Not only was I starving, but I couldn't help but wonder why all the other patrons were getting their dim sum while I was just sitting there watching and waiting for my measly 2 to-go items. They weren't that busy. When I finally got up to inquire, for the second time, and say I was out of time to wait, the woman who took my order rushed into the kitchen and came back with one of the items (the black pepper duck buns) and then grabbed the other item that had been sitting on the counter for at least 20 minutes already, and said they made a fresh batch of the black pepper buns for me. That's nice and all, but the shrimp dumplings that were sitting on the counter for 20 minutes were now ice cold and greasy. It's too bad, I was excited to try this place, but won't give it another shot now
3
We went on a weekend and was fortunate we didn't have to queue for a table. The menu is focused mainly on the duck, roast meats, some noodle dishes and mainly dim sum. I wasn't impressed by the quality of the dim sum. The roast meats were better. The famous roast duck is pretty tender and tasty although I do find the duck to be on the skinny side. The food is not too bad but I won't queue for it should I visit the next time.
4
Good spot to stop for lunch while shopping on Orchard Rd. Food and service good and reasonably priced.
3
Took our dad for Father's Day. Best dish was the signature crispy snow buns with duck. Ordered seconds.
Otherwise the dim sum are pretty standard.
4
Went in on a rainy Friday evening for dinner with my lucky self.Had the duck noodles and the crispy pork. The duck noodles were good. Not a big portion but enough to taste duck and noodles together in one plate. The soup was rather peppery but the duck was tender with some bones to challenge. Noodles were well done. Not too soft yet springy and with good texture. Crispy pork serving was a bit small but all good in taste and the skin was crispy and wafer thin. Best was the chilli dip. Shiok. Not sure why mustard was served with crispy pork. Bad combo
1
This is not worth visiting if you are a duck lover. Is a HK joint and most likely operated by mainland chinese in the kitchen.The braised duck wings are salty, salty and salty that's all I could remember. I couldn't even finish the small portion of wings. Simply too salty for my taste. And is the worst I have in my entire life.Regretted and will ever step into this place agian
2
Ordered the duck bun, chee cheong fun, duck noodles, wanton noodles and duck porridge. But the duck meat is not crispy enough and not fragrant enough. The noodles texture is not bad but very very small portion. The porridge is too plain and tasteless. The chee cheong fun is alright. Prob won;t go back. The beijing duck from imperial treasure beats this 
4
The duck here is delightful and you can have it with rice, noodles and congee. The char siew (pork belly) is a wee bit fatty, but the crackling roasted pork was pretty good.While the dim sum and other items on the menu were tasty too, the key draw here should be the duck
3
@TheKuoKnowsI am in two minds about London Fat Duck. On the one hand the Roast Duck was quite superb. But on the other hand, the price seems a little steep at 48 bucks for a whole bird.That said, the duck was exquisite. A tasty skin enveloped a meaty duck with barely a trace of fat. It was also very well presented. So, only fond memories and a sprig of parsley remained at the end of the meal.The Crispy Roast Belly Pork was also outstanding. How do they get the Siu Yuk crackling so perfect? The let-down, though, was the portion size. It was quite meagre.Kai Lan was not an optional seasonal vegetable. Only Choy Sum was on offer. I don't believe Kai Lan is rationed in Singapore. So a choice of seasonal vegetables would not go amiss.There are lots to like about London Fat Duck. But if it is going to charge "Scotts Square" prices, then it has to at least try to serve Albert Square portions. That is, if you are true to your London name
1
This place i strongly do not recommend as there are many houseflies flying around and disturb me and my friends while we have dinner. Heard is newly open in vivo city at basement 2. Wanted to try out but it was really dissappointing. The food is not tasty at all and to have so many houseflies flying around the table while having meal is horrible. All the service staffs are not attentive at all. Horrible horrible please do not waste your money
2
This being the moon cake festival in singapore, when a small dish of 4 thinly sliced moon cakes were served we thought it was for tasting so we could buy them home when our meal ends. At checkout we were told these were "pickles" and chargeable at $3. I requested for the bill to be retabulated since we were not told the cost beforehand. A rather non-transparent bit of marketing here, i wld say. Although they acceded to my request, this left a tinge of a bad taste to an otherwise juicy and fatty duck rice I had. Check your "pickles" when you come here.
4
Specialized in roasted duck. The rice is normal while the noodle is specially thin that can either flow through or stuck in the gaps between the teeth. The duck is smooth and soft and the skin roasted to perfect crispy texture.The signature side dishes include London duck buns with pepper or original flavour, crispy shrimp dumplings and steamed cheong fun. My personal pick is the pepper London duck bun coated with black pepper adding spicy flavour to the outer bun which upon "bitten" "secreted" juicy sauce enclosing small bits of duck meat
3
Maybe they ran out of fat ducks....but ours was not especially juicy and fat like those in London. ...
Maybe they have lost their magic......
Duck also was that tasty....no different from what we can get from the food courts....
2
Located in Scott's square. Food is so so only. The har kau skin is thick. I ordered their signature roast duck with roast pork as in photo. I was given the breast meat which consist mainly bones. Maybe just my unlucky day.
4
Service was just passable. But soon forgotten with the really lovely duck and roast meats.
Recommend to go after 3pm to avoid the crowd and have faster service.
Do also order their carrot cakes!
4
Overall great char Siew and roasted pork belly and roast duck which is more meaty and have more favours. Truly enjoy my lunch here. Prices are rather friendly. Perhaps was there just before noon and place does gets pack up rather fast.
3
We had heard so much about London Fat Duck and decided to check it out for ourselves. We ordered the Pork Congee with Century Egg, and Roast Duck Noodles. Both were pretty good. Unfortunately the rest of the dim sum items ordered did not hit the mark at all.The Duck Snow Buns were way too sweet; and so was the Steamed Chee Cheong Fun. The Shrimp in Crispy Beancurd Skin Fritters were super greasy and almost dripping in oil. The Crispy Black Pepper Duck Spring Rolls were indeed crispy but the filling was again too sweet and I found the black pepper to be overpowering. The panfried carrot cake was just average.My advice to the restaurant: stick to serving the roast meats and forget the dim sum
4
We went to the new outlet at Vivo City. The duck has very nice and crispy skin, meat was juicy and the sauces nice. The roasted meat - especially 'char Siew' is nice.Other dim sum not bad. Taste like most HK cruisine prepared by HK chefs. Place was crowded. Book early or queue early. Pro.icing reasonable. Sitting capacity limited
2
The signature roasted duck was fragrant and quite juicy. It was not bad but did not impress at all. Both the black pepper bun and crispy snow bun was good. The rest of the dishes was quite a disaster. 2 of items was almost uneatable: the jellyfish was too sour and the the char-siew was over burned. Service was not able to cope with the pack restaurant that afternoon. Overall it was a very disappointing lunch
4
Went there for lunch with my in-laws and family. Ordered the duck dish, char siew, roasted, pandan snow custard bun and signature black pepper London Duck bun. The char siew was made from more fatty meat and tasted a little spongy. The duck, pandan snow bun and roasted pork were nice. However we found the black pepper London duck bun was too spicy and peppery. Perhaps should have tried the London Duck Snow bun
4
Make sure to 'order only' the whole duck so you can be sure of the parts given.I came here once for a single portion meal accompanied with noodle, and I was given a few pathetic pieces of boney-parts with hardly any meat. I was so disappointed. It gives me the impression that they're serving left-over parts taken from 'whole' duck orders from others
3
Being a fan of roast duck, I just had to try this new place out. There was a queue even though I decided to have an early dinner at around 5.30pm. Waited for around 30 minutes or so before we were shown to our table.We ordered the combination platter for 3 people, which was made up of some roast duck, roasted pork belly and char siew. We also ordered a plate of dumpling noodles and carrot cake.The roasted combination platter, although they said was for 3, was miserably small. The duck we were given was made up of mostly ribs. We should have tried ordering half a duck or something, which would give us a more well rounded taste of the bird. There was nothing spectacular about the duck I must say. The char siew on the other hand was pretty good! It had a nice smokiness about it with the flavors lingering in the mouth. Quite well done for local standards. The roasted pork belly was the best of the 3 meats. The meat was not too salty and the skin was beautifully crispy. It went perfectly well with the horseradish sauce. If I had to deduct points, I would deduct it for being too small a portion.The carrot cake was quite well done, it had nice chunks of white raddish embedded in it and the overall flavor was just nice. It wasn't overly greasy and went very well with the chilli sauce.The dumpling noodles were pretty average, nice fat dumplings but the portions were incredibly small. Thankfully that order was meant for a 4 year old who finished it quite easily. The service however, just like in most local places, leaves much to be desired. When we were nearly done with our meal, and I do mean nearly done, the waiters were overly enthusiastic about cleaning the table and started taking away the empty bowls and plates and some of the cutlery......leaving me to wonder how was I to finish off that last piece of carrot cake on the table. My daughter, who took a "break" during dinner to use the toilet, nearly had her bowl of noodles taken away as well and we had to tell the waiter that we weren't done a few times while his hands went all over the table. I can understand the rush but they missed out on us ordering desserts
3
Most pieces of BBQ meat was burnt, duck was soft but the flavour wasn't there, the roasted pork was good with the mustard. Overall service was poor.
5
One of my cheaper eats in Singapore and amazingly good. The roast duck was tender and juicy, while the skin was crisp, the crispy pork was perfect and the char sui was out of this world.
4
London Fat Duck is definitely one of the best Roast Duck restaurant. Prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity.
They have nice menu and most of the food are high standard
4
Great duck place. Their roasted duck is succulent and tender. Don't forget the char siew (BBQ pork with honey sauce). A little charred on the outside, yet soft and tender inside. It is a simple place for Hong Kong style noodles and porridge.
4
Had dinner with my friends at London Fat Duck, located at Scotts Square basement tonight. Nearest MRT will be Orchard station.It's the few restaurants that still serves dim sum all day. Nice roast duck, roast pork and smooth porridge. Restaurant has about 40-50 seating, with 2 big tables good for 8 persons each. Polite waiters and waitresses served promptly.Enjoyed. Tasty food at above average prices
3
Heard so often there's London fat duck. Then, there's also 4 Seasons @ Capitol. At last, I am trying this London fat duck.Average is an understatement I must admit. The next rating is very good which honestly, it would be an overkill. Let's put it, it's GOOD.For the price I paid for today @ $26. It's overpriced for just a portion, with plain noodles n hot tea.I had an amazing portion in London @ four Seasons, same offering at a much lower price than Singapore. Furthermore, it was better.Let's put it this way. At $26. I won't be back for awhile.Duck 7/10Ambience : 6/10Service : 7/1
5
Had lunch with 4 other colleagues, good and value for money tim sum. Great Roast Duck, its really fat.. juicy and flavourful. The Hong Kong style noodles were good too. Mixed review of the Roast Char Siew as well as the signature Pandan liu sha Bao.. I love them both but not my colleagues.The crab porridge was good :)Total damage $131 for 5 persons, I think its really affordable, bearing in mind the amount of food we ate.We were seated at a corner, and found it difficult to capture the attention of the service staff. But when served, they were friendly and assisted accordingly. Food service was really fast, and fresh! Only one gripe, throw the jumpy CD that you are using, its jumps really badly and is an ear-sore! Will definitely be back
2
We were at the Waterway Point outlet last evening for dinner. Needed to wait 20 to 30 minutes for a table on a weekday night. We were attracted by the long queue to try the food there. The portions were pathetically small. Unreasonably over priced for everything, especially for the plate of duck noodles with only four thin slices of duck meat @$8.80 and tasted bland. When you asked for chilli, the waitress would forget totally even though you reminded her twice. That would be our first and last visit to London Fat Duck
1
Was at the Waterway Point outlet this evening for dinner. Waited for more than half an hour for a table at 7:30pm on a weekday night. Portions were small. Ridiculously over priced. Plain steamed rice was $2 per small bowl. 15 thin slices of char siew costs $12.80. First time, last time and one time too many
3
No need to queue when I was at the Waterway Point outlet for a weekday late lunch.Tried the mixed roast platter (signature roast duck, crackling pork belly & bbq pork), black pepper bun and wanton noodle.I find the black pepper taste was too strong for the bun. The roast duck was nice, but nothing fantastic. The surprised was the pork belly. The skin was indeed crackling, while the meat was tender
1
So so only. I can confirm it is not even near the look and taste on London roasted duck. Quite disappointed
3
It was ok. Some strange flavour combinations. Food was freshly cooked and good quality.
Could find better valued meals elsewhere.
5
Managed to try out this place in HK by Gordon Ramsey.
Great food and service. Great view of harbour. Wonderful crowd and atmosphere.
3
tried this at waterwaypoint mall (Punggol) ordered the signature duck congee and duck platter. food was basic so as the presentation. tasted clean though which was good.service was average. not friendly, not snobbish either. would be a good place to eat if you're just looking for something to fill the stomach but not really for culinary pleasure
1
Crispy duck but the skin is not crisp but chewy.The filling inside the signature bun is sweet, taste more like chopped up bbq pork than duck! We ordered the original flavour without the pepper. Was served the pepper ones but as it is our first time in the restaurant and they do not have any me use with pictures for you to see while seated, we therefore was not aware that they had served u the pepper version until we took one and cut up to try. We told the waitress and they only replaced with 2 buns instead of the whole plate of 3! It's not our fault if they serve the wrong item but why should we be have only 2 out of 3 replaced! Chinese tea is not even warm let alone hot.The dish servings are very pathetic for the price 
3
Prior to the dinner, I admit I had too high expectation on the food and this seemed to lower my dining experience. The theme of the dinner- London fat duck, as the name implies, the duck is indeed fat. Hence after the 5th or 6th piece of the duck, we got really full and felt sick of eating more. The restaurant also served other dim sum but the taste was so-so only
4
So there is some dim sum dishes but otherwise it is all about the duck. This is suppose to be the wagyu of duck air flown from Ireland - it is that good with a thick layer of fat between the skin and meat. There is very little else on the menu though, so its all about the duck
2
With all the rave about the "Wagyu of Duck", I decided to try it out for myself. Let's start with the food. To be honest, the duck tasted pretty average to me. I personally prefer their Char Siew better than the Roasted Duck (and my girlfriends agreed too). Besides that, the rest of the dishes are alright. I won't say it's fantastic or like out-of-this-world. But if you do head down and try, do try their Duck Bun and Egg Tarts. That I recommend. Be warned though. With the expected waiting time (since they just opened and everyone wants a piece of their duck), the place was a little messy and chaotic. The plus point for them for our night there is the lovely wait-staff who was assisting us (just that one nice auntie) and that the food came almost instantaneously.Now, I can say "I've been there, done that.
4
I am from the U.S. so I may not have many good experiences with real Chinese bar b q. I am in love with this place and am so glad I was able to stop by for a bite of heaven. The roast pork here was awesome. I love how the meat is marbled with fat and then a thin crispy skin, there is no thick layer of fat that I am accustomed to here in the states. Can't wait to come back
3
I find the restaurant name cute although I can't quite connect London and fat duck. The food served here is Cantonese cuisine. Roasted duck is very fatty and a little too salty so this experience may be rather scary for health conscious eaters. I prefer the Char Siew meat as it is pretty well done. Food quality is good but not exceptional. I do know of hawker stalls that serve similar or higher quality roasted duck
3
Visited the shop twice. The duck is tasty but is fat. Noodle with roasted pork is nice. Overall, foods are good but not the best in town.
3
The duck was a disappointment this time. It tasted a bitter and was rather fat. The dim sums were good but nothing to shout about. However the custard buns were worth eating. They were uniquely baked with pandan on the outside
2
We ordered the duck noodle. The duck tasted so so only. It had way too much fat for our liking. The noodle was bland and had very little sauce on it. I didn't take the veg because the leaf hung out of the plate and touched the table - disrespectful of the food and the customers they serve.Biggest turnoff: The service staff put the dishes meant for the table besides us on our small and cramp table while they made space over there. They neither asked for our permission nor apologised for the inconvenience and discomfort caused. They couldn't be bothered whether it disturbed our dining pleasure. I will NEVER eat there again, ever
4
This restaurant is located at the newly opened Waterway Point at 83, Punggol Central #01-23.You could travelled by bus, LRT and taxi to this Mall.It serves various roasted duck dishes, Hong Kong Congee and noodles, Rice, dim sum, seasonal vegetables, desserts and beverages.Their Signature dishes are London Roast Duck, Barbecue Pork with Honey Sauce, Black Pepper London Duck Bun, Steamed Cheong Fun.The filling of this Cheong Fun is a fried spring roll with prawn. Very unique but please consume while it is hot.The Hong Kong Wanton Noodle and their Golden Custard Bun is a must try dishes.Their Buns surprised me in a way that the skin of normal buns are steamed soft; but their outlook are like biscuit form which are dry. But the buns must be consumed while hot.Those who likes duck dishes should give it a try. But the waiting time is not very encouraging. We waited for 40 mins before a table is available
1
We ordered duck with rice, crackling pork with rice, each dish $7.80. It came with one half stalk of xiaobaicai, and just a splash of sauce. The duck was powdery to taste. It was quite honestly a big disappointment and there are many hawker centres which would easily surpass this restaurant in standard. A dish of oyster veg also cost $$7.80, consisting of eight half stalks of xiaobaicai boiled and splashed with oyster sauce. There was no queue. We told the wait staff that the food was not acceptable. She thought we were talking about the rice itself, and could not believe that we were talking about the duck. Never again

Xiao Long Bao is juicy and meaty but the dipping sauce is salty with little ginger . Dried wanton noodle is eaten best with chilli sauce , only comment is quite pricy with little noodles served. "Ting chai" congee is actually congee with cuttlefish and peanuts . But the peanuts too hard. Duck is juicy and oily , if you don't mind the oil. Meat is tender. Service is good.

For the branding I would have to say really smart putting the name "London" in there. I bet many people would have mistaken this place coming from London, only the duck and it's not even from London it's from Ireland.Anyway enough of the history lesson, here is my verdict and as a fan of roast duck, I have my fare share of top ducks around HKG and London this one rank lowly if I were to compare with any of the restaurants I've tried.Taste wise i would have to agree the fats of the duck is really juicy but the let down came with the tenderness and the sauce let alone presentation (not that Goldmine has any beautiful presentation) but I just can't accept the pungent after taste you get.The Char siew is dry and bored with overly sweeten sauce. Wanton noodle was good with plump shrimps Wanton and al dente noodle but soup was just overly salty to my liking.The redeemer here is the liu sha bao, all I have to say try is their dim sum more than what they are known for.Don't expect much service as wait staff seems clueless at times and I was served the wrong dish. Was at the Punggol outlet at 10.15am. If you want duck.. I suggest you going to other place

Food was excellent... Loved the Roasted pork and duck.. moist and tasty! I ordered a Congee with pork liver and it was delicious as well. Loved the food at this restaurant! But the only reason they don't get a full 5/5 rating is because of the not so friendly staff. Even though the food they served kind of made up for it but still... service is probably the most important thing they should be upholding in a restaurant. Nonetheless... great food

Food was alright, no wow factor. We were truly disappointed with the service, rude and unreliable. I also ordered take away however they missed out a few items on the list but yet I was charged for the dimsum. And when I returned a couple of days later to claim the missing items, the service staff was not happy. Did not even apologise!Extremely poor service

My family and I visited the newly opened outlet at Punggol Waterway Point for dinner. We ordered the duck buns (HK "Po lo" style), steamed shrimp dumpling (har gao), siew mai, assorted 3 BBQ meats platter, shrimp/pork dumpling soup with noodles, vegetables with oyster sauce and signature rice rolls. The dim sum items were fresh and tasty and very similar to the good Guangzhou dim sum restaurants that I went to, but not as good as the HK ones. The rice rolls we ordered were actually deep fried spring rolls covered with a thin layer of smooth rice flour skin. Quite novel for me but not as tasty. The noodles were comparable with Canton Paradise and some HK restaurants. Shrimp/pork dumplings were very flavourful due to the fresh ingredients and had a good texture. But the best was the roast meat platter. The pork belly (sio bak) and roast duck could easily match those offered at fine dining Cantonese restaurants and the tender BBQ pork (char siew) had a rich and luxurious sauce.
3
We were disappointed with the poor service, very small meal sizes and expensive for what you got. The food was ok, plenty of other better places in Singapore to go. Wouldn't go back.
3
Ordered normal very fatty Duck, tasty and nice Pork Belly, over burn at the side of Char Siew tasted bitter and satringent rice and noodle.
Told the waitess, she scine unhappy to take my comment.
4
Had breakfast on 30/1/16 duck noodle, porridge some tim sum. The duck bun still good and so is the custard bun serve pipping hot yum yum, love it. For 4 pax we spend $67.00 also have some duck wing, carrot cake , chicken feet, dough fritter.Good place for tim sum

So what if they source their ducks from a renowned farm in London? Without the know-how and skills, even if they use some sort of celestial phoenix, it will still taste mortally cheap.However, London Fat Duck achieved in proving to be a model example of Marketing 101.So A for marketing, a big fat and oily F for everything else
3
Before today I had only ordered takeaway char siew which was nice and tender but expensive @ $15.90 for 11 small slices. Not sure that it was worth it. I had also ordered the black pepper duck buns (all good - moist, tender duck, soft bun - except maybe a bit too much of the black pepper).Today I had a late lunch in the restaurant. By the way, they have taken additional space (see photo). Had duck noodles and warm barley. Duck was tender, skin not crispy at all. I had to remove the fat but alas the skin came off too. Barley was not even warm. Waiters and Waitresses in Singapore food outlets have a problem understanding 'hot', 'warm' & 'luke warm'.So my conclusion is that it is not 'die, die must eat'
2
Used to like this place a lot for the food - would have given 5 stars thenNow, Duck and noodles the only things worth making the trip forService is poor, even worse than HK fast food restaurants - part time staff are better than the full timersToo many things wrong with the service to listTip - dont go for meals In between times just have a plate of duck and noodlesTip 2 - costs less per head if u bring small children as their tables are strictly per head and not by the amount of food you order (they will clear unfinished plates to make room for all the dishes you order if you order 'too many' dishesTip 3 - check the bill, overcharging happened more than onceOtherwise you'd do better at a more upscale dim sum restaurant w/out overcrowding, condescending attitudes and staff chasing you out so that they can pack in the next bunch of familiesOr if you're just into noodles, for similar quality noodles (sadly, no irish ducks) go to Maks at CentrepointAverage bill for 2 - US$70 without beverage
3
It's an aircon eatery, your typical modern HK roasted meat shop in a mall. The service is something you need to manage your own expectations, do not expect well trained staff. You won't get patient introduction of each dish, or recommendations, you are quite expected to write down what you want on the menu paper and have little chit chat. That said, the duck is good, noodles decent, soup is the usual HK too salty type, wanton noodles, dim sum, etc are average. I would come back again, but not often. The food is decent for the price you pay. But that said, you can get very similar standard at any neighborhood coffee shop roasted meat delights stalls.

We had our 2015 Countdown in Singapore. My Sister insist that we visit this place as she had a good experiences here and compared it with the duck we had in London.Was told that this place is usually pack and queue up to two hours!! We went early New Year (1 Jan 2016) morning (10:00am), since everyone still suffering from hangover during countdown (haahaahaa)....We ordered duck, pork belly, char Siew, and dim sums.The duck is good but not great. Quite bony. Crispy Pork Belly and Char-Siew are better.Dim Sum are not bad too. The Crispy Char-Siew Pao is a must tryThe plain noodle is quite tough, not good.When we finished around 11:15am, the queue already formed. Overall, its okay food. Give it at try.The place is in Basement 1 (B1) Scott Square Orchard Road) The building next to Tang Plaza (which is opposite ION
3
Went around 6pm. Luckily the crowd is not big. Manage to get a table for 2. Try the duck noodle, duck peppers poa, chicken legs n red beans jelly. The noodle is salty n nothing special. Ask for egg tarts but is out of stock. They don't have time to make the base. Will try another time..
3
Visited the London Fat Duck today. We had the Roast Duck, crispy Pork Belly, Char Siew Bao crispy buns and Cheong Fun. With Chinese tea and Barley the total bill was just over $50. The star dish was the pork belly. The duck was so-so with a lot of bone and not too much meat. I would not go back for the duck but the other dishes were good. Service was quick and efficient.
4
brought an oversea guest there 9th nov 2015. order the famous duck, tim sum
the food standard is still good. tim sum range not very large but quality is good enough to fill the stomach.
4
my 2nd returning visit to the restaurant.
their ducks are really nice.. the roasted pork is also another must try item to order. porridge was alright but not the noodles. service rendered would need some form of improvement. their buns are good too!snowy bun especially
4
Be prepared to wait for your queue if you come during dinner timings.
Great tasting duck, very fatty. Typical Chinese restaurant type of setting, with oily floors.
3
Previously when it opened the queues were long and the duck was juicy and delicious....Went back recently and we were able to get a table easily (has the interest died?)....and the duck was not as good as before. ...And they only have one type.of vegetable.....no choice...
4
This restaurant used duck from Ireland, which has a nice layer of fat.After roasting, it tasted different from the local varieties.Other then the signature roast duck, which is good., the signature black pepper London duck bun is unique too.The bun had a thick layer of black pepper on it outer surface of the bun filled with duck meat. The combination gives a very interesting taste with sweet and peppery at the same time.The rest of the noodle and Tim Sum dishes are of good quality too.This is one of the few places in Singapore that serves Tim Sum after 3pm.I would return again to try the rest of the dishes
3
Had lunch with friends about a month ago and we all found the duck and char siew pretty yummy. I like my pork slightly fatty and the char siew at London Fat Duck had just the right balance, in my opinion. It was also nicely charred on the outside. The duck meat was moist and tender. And not gamey. Service was prompt. I returned once to do a takeaway. Something I wouldn't do again. The taste just wasn't the same and everyone at home felt it was no better than the roast duck at our nearby food centre. This proves once again that many foods are best eaten on the spot. I'd be happy to go back to London Fat Duck for that plate of duck noodles or char siew rice if there isn't any queue
5
Stopped in for a a take-away order. They were quick to take my order and the food was prepared in a reasonable time.I ordered BBQ pork with the Honey Sauce, Shrimp Dumplings, Radish Cakes and Crispy Shrimp Dumplings.Each dish was delicious. You do not need this many dishes for a meal as this was way more food than I needed. It was so good that I did end up eating too much though
4
I knew that I loved this place after my first experience and I knew that I would be returning. Four visits and I still want more. That is four visits in three weeks!. If you like efficient staff, authentic food and a taste paradise then come here. You would usually order with pen and check boxes but sometimes they bring out the iPads which is fun. My few recommendations: get the brisket noodle. It is incredible. Any of the dim sum is also wonderful. My favourite is the steamed prawns. The Hong Kong won tons are very good too. My one disappointment was the signsture fat duck dumpling. Mostly rice and little duck. Of course I have to mention the duck. Excellent but it comes with the bones. So note that. Before I go home, I will be back. Come off peak, you will be waiting at peak hours for a minimum of an hour. 4pm for lunch and 8 pm for dinner are my suggestions

This review is not about the food as I have reviewed this before. Have the much applauded roast duck as well as roast meats but you certainly don't come here for the exemplary service.Firstly I have to say my expectations are minimal as this is not a fine dining restaurant, just your basic Chinese eatery. Having established this, I would have to express shock at being driven out after 40 minutes. This is something that has never happened to me. Ever.I had lunch with friends & while there was never any intention to linger, even my friends were shocked at the level of rudeness when we were asked to leave after the last dish was cleared. There was no attempt to ask if we cared for dessert. Last time I ate here, service was brusque & I did not expect much. In future if I craved the duck, it would be better to get take out rather than sit through this sort of treatment. It isn't worth it & we weren't even demanding customers. All we asked was to be able to leave when we were ready. By the way it was the tail end of lunch & there certainly wasn't a queue
4
Had no idea that this restaurant might be popular but it happened to be near where we were staying so decided to try it out and enjoyed the food. Figure we should ordered the specials so stuck with the pork and the duck and the buns and they were all delicious. There was a bit of a queue at about 7pm but we were seated within about 15 minutes, service was quick and we enjoyed the buzzy atmospher
4
Excellent taste of Barbeque Pork with Honey Sauce. One of best in Singapore in addition to the Signature London Roast Duck. Queue is more than 30 mins but it is worth it. Black pepper London Duck Bun is another great choice. The duck and pork are so juicy. Better come earlier to avoid long queue
3
Waited for more than 30mins on a Friday dinner. Worth the wait? I don't think so. Can get half the price for the duck noodle at hawker, with similar or better taste. For those who like the duck snow bun, can give it a try. Sweet and crispy.
1
If I am not mistaken, this restaurant is inspired by the four seasons and gold mine in bayswater, London. We had the roast duck, char siew, egg tart, duck snow bun and weren't impressed with either of the items. The duck fat wasn't rendered at all - the roast roast duck had thick slab of fat between the skin and meat. I didn't know they meant the name London fat duck that literally. In my opinion, the ideal roast duck should have succulent meat texture but with minimal visual fat between the skin and meat. The meat was kind of dry in this case. Char siew was okay, loads of honey. Egg tart had more flour taste than egg. The duck snow bun needs improvement because the snow bun is sweet with the powdered sugar on top, the duck sauce was even sweeter. Just a quarter of this snow bun sends you in line for diabetes. I guess we just expected so much more because we liked the four season's version of roast duck and when we visited the restaurant, we had the impression that it would be similar
5
If you like the roast duck to be crispy and a bit fat, then you will enjoy this. If you like your duck lean, then this is not for you. We had it for lunch together with wanton noodles which was very good too with the noodles al Dente. Had the roast pork and the famous snow bun. Only problem is they do not allow reservation so you have to go early and queue. Also not many big tables
4
For enthusiats inChinese Dimsum this restaurant is a must when visiting Singapore. The spiciness and crispy texture of the bun really had me begging for more. I tried Siew Long Pao too and it turned out to be quite good for me. Served hot and not so overpriced making dim sum here a lovely experience in my trip this time. I went during late afternoon hours which made me getting no long queuing experience, so I would recommend the time for your visit to avoid the crowd
5
Now this place is amazing. The food was the best we had in Singapore. Yes you have to wait (we waited an hour) but there is a good reason for that and it's worth every second. We ordered while we waited so when we were called to a table the food was fast and ohhh so yummy. We tried a bit of everything and there was not one thing to complain about. If you are in Singapore make sure you take the time to check this little hidden gem out!Thank you London Fat Duck - you are a credit to Singapor
4
waited 15 minutes at around 7pm on a weekday for my seat. the duck meat is tender and the skin crispy, the pepper charsiew bun was pipping hot. i ordered one whole duck and was only given 2 teaspoon full of plum sauce, i asked for extra plum sauce and was given another 2 teaspoon's full :( will go back again for the food
4
The waiter couldn't find our reservation and the place was full. They sat 6 of us at a table for 4, and it was a tight squeeze. They promised us the next available table but it never happened.We ordered a number of dishes and a few stood out, among which was the roast duck which was very tender and delicious. The salted egg custard buns were nice, but the bun was very thin and it broke, leaking its contents all over my hand.The roast pork was crispy and lean, but the pieces were unevenly cut, and the portion seemed very small for the price
4
We ate both the duck and the char siew...both were amazing! Also had the black pepper buns, which are a must. Service is prompt, friendly, and courteous. We brought our own wine, corkage fee a bit steep but we wanted something great to drink with such great food
3
Ok, the name is attractive. Expect to queue since the restaurant doesn't take reservations. The duck is fatty, dripping with oil, succulent, sinful i.e. tasty. The other must-try dish is the pepper-flavoured duck meat bun which is freshly baked. Apart from these, I had tried the char siew and the roast meat, both of which seemed a tad ordinary. But the duck is worth coming back for. Service is quite prompt and courteous. A crowd-puller in the otherwise quiet basement of Scotts Square.
4
High in demand and patience required for a long wait to obtain a table. Roast pork & duck sell out very fast so order them when you get your queue number. Selection of vegetable dishes was poor.

Decided to bring my in-laws to this new duck outlet for dinner after knowing that the brand now has a branch here in singapore as i am a big fan of roasted duck.First impression was that the restaurant felt more like a food court. We were directed to the VIP room. The VIP room consists of 2 large tables and sadly, the other group in our room was very noisy and rowdy as its a group consisted of all men, most like colleagues. Anyway, the background music was also very loud and thus, very irritating. Called the server to ask them to turn down the volume but told me cannot be done. Asked her to get her manager and after her manager came in, he decided to lower the volume.Service is only so-so and atmosphere as well. But the duck is good in my opinion. But i expect a complete dining experience as the food here is not really cheap as well. Wanted to change the size of the dishes we ordered after they served them and we realised its too little for all of us. The server told us that we cannot do it. I was so puzzled why not as simply they could bring back the medium plate of duck and add more to it. Instead she asked me to order another medium plate which made the whole meal more expensive.If its not for the service and atmosphere, i would have given it a 4 out of 5
3
Arrived at 6:30 pm on a Sunday night and saw a small crowd already waiting. Was told the wait will be about 20 mins which was acceptable but instead we waited for almost 45 mins before given a table for 7 of us.As mentioned the place is more a cafeteria style whereby you select from the order chit the food you wanted. Looking at the prices, would same it is reasonable considering the location and service is much better than expected.The side dishes such as the porridge is good as well as the duck bun.However the duck as mentioned is very fatty to suit me though the skin is rightly roasted. They should work on improving the choices of vegetables though as there is only 1 item. Overall the price is reasonable but not worth the wait
4
I went to this restaurant with high hopes that the duck would resemble those I've eaten in London and it did not fail me. The duck was obviously not from our part of the world as the layer of fats was exceptionally thicker than normal. The price for a portion for 1-2 persons at $12.80 was reasonable especially if you are eating other dishes. The Shrimp dumpling soup was normalThe crispy London duck snow bun was commendable tho a tad sweet. Egg tarts were actually very good. Very Flaky pastry with excellent smooth egg filling
4
Went there on a weekday for lunch. There was a long Q but well controlled. Suppose it is a novelty for Singaporeans. The wait was worth it . The duck is tasty, succulent and the noodles have a nice crunch. We also had the "char siew" which is more local than "London" . It tasted sweet and goes well with ric
3
I have lived many year in London," though many years ago ". . and love the duck served in the Chines restaurants there. The duck here does not live up to any that I have had in London, in any restaurants there.I like the buns with a sweet black peber crust though . and i am glad I went for these.I will only go if I was close by . . agai

I am not a fans of Duck meat but London Fat Duck had left a deep impression in my mouth. For health conscious people might not like the fatness of the meat. I Iove the fatness of the meat, soft to chew and the roasted Skin is crisp, goes very well with the plum sauce. Tried their signature Chee Cheong Fun, it's actually the fried prawn spring roll wrap with Chee Cheong Fun, interesting combine and its delicious. Black Pepper duck Snow Bun taste like McDonald's Prosperity burger. Overall feel the food is good but might not want to queue too long for a table.
4
This place did not disappoint me. Had the duck and noodles and plenty of dim sum and polished off everything. Price is very reasonable and portions are reasonable. Good quality dim sum and the duck was very tasty. A great place for anyone who loves duck and dim sum in general. Would definitely come back for more!!
4
Was recommended by my uncle to try this place and was pleasantly surprised. The black pepper duck bun was very good and the cha siu was original tasting. Slight complaint would be the duck...very fatty and if that's what you like, then there should be no problem. Overall a simple and good lunch experience and would definitely recommend to others
4
Had lunch recently & found the food to be good. Nice roast duck with crispy skin and a flavoursome sauce. Decent roast pork with crispy crackling and excellent char siu that was dark and glazed with charred bits that so many look for. Hong Kong style dishes that judging from the dishes we had would get my thumbs up. Nice shrimp dumpling soup & congee. A selection of dim sum available - recommend the black pepper buns which are a nice variation on the familiar "po lor bau".The restaurant fills up fast and doesn't take reservations. Go early to snag a table without too much of a wait. However they are forgetful and we were overlooked despite being given a queue number. No apologies but they quickly got us a table when reminded. Servers tend to be inattentive and it's hard to catch their attention; they all seemed too busy. Perhaps the best suggestion is to order take out & save all the hassle. Other people did. Would definitely come back for the food.Essentially for small portions, the bill came to S$100 including an order of custard tarts for dessert
4
Good Hong Kong style dinning, have taken London roast duck noodle, signature black pepper bun and crispy London duck snow bun and love it.
3
Came here for lunch . Had dim sum and the signiture fat duck. Duck was good, dim sum was average. Service is ok.
4
I was glad that I asked for take out with such a long wait going for those looking to eat at the restaurant. It was a small area and hence the long queue. I ordered the char siew noodles and duck noodles. Both are dry version . The take away was a genius, the sauces and chili were all provided in separate containers. by the time I got home, the noodles were still springy ,not soggy

LFD is not related to the Four Seasons Restaurant in London and also has nothing to do with the Fat Duck in UK. Instead the ducks were claimed to be Irish. It is only a typical Hong Kong style Cantonese restaurant.Although the shop names emphasised on duck, you can also find many others Hong Kong style dim sum, wanton noodle and etc. The roast ducks is nice but not fantastically nice. The ducks served was fat and juicy. On the other hand the Honey sauced Char Siew is surprisingly good. Fat but not greasy. We didn't get to try the roast pork. The other dim sum and dumpling that we had ordered are actually quite authentically Hong Kong that you can find it in any Hong Kong street stalls.The time we visited the restaurant was on a Saturday evening and long queue had already formed and we have to wait for 50 mins to get our table. By the time our turn was up at 8pm, many items on the menu had been sold out.The pricing of the food is at mid range and mostly appropriately priced except the white rice that cost us SGD2.50 per bowl which is outrageous.Verdict is the food is good, price is reasonable and location is good so we don't mind coming back again if the waiting time can be shorter
1
I was waiting for someone to assist me to be seated when a guy approached me and lead me to the table.. however, i was directed to one of the table that was dirty and seems that the previous customer had just left. . I dont mind seating but the impression could have been better if they seated me to a clean and already set up table (which they have few coz they werent that busy much when i came)..anyway i order congee with century egg.. shrimp spring roll and an ice tea.. congee came befire the drinks and it would be better if they add a little bit of veggies or perhps like spring onion inside to shrimp springroll coz it tastes to plain.. neverthe less the congee tastes ok..
4
The roast ducks are indeed fat like its namesake and that's exactly what it has promised to offer and that's what I am here for. It's probably one of the few restaurants in Singapore which is serving free range ducks from Ireland. It's definitely above average - duck is juicy, flavorful and fat. I also tried the black pepper duck bun, which is quite delicious. I went at 5ish on a Saturday and was seated in 15-20mins. Will revisit if i am in the neighbourhood and if I dont have to wait for too long. And at $48 per duck, it's quite reasonably priced
3
Singapore hawker food is hard to beat. Fat duck buns are tasty although a bit too sweet for me. The duck has enough taste and texture to warrant another visit if you are around the area and need a quick duck fix. The char siew deserves be a mention but is priced more than its weight in gold. Long live the hawker centers!!
1
Well, as stated above. my fellow Singaporeans, open your eyes and stop being media manipulated.The food is bad, seriously bad. And with prices like that, i scoff in disgust. Apparently not the 45min-1hr wait time crowd.when you are charging $12-15++ per portion of roasted meat, it better be freaking good, ESPECIALLY if that said portion is only enough for 1 person.Duck - tasteless, soggy skin, crappy 'sauce' ( 70% oil in sauce )Roast Pork - ridiculous portion (i literally laughed), Damn dry. Saw them microwaving some food items, perhaps it's pork?Char siew- passable, too sweet and cloying. Perfect if it's candied pork not char siew.Duck buns (Both black and white) - While the bun itself was good, the filling was Crap. too much Starch in the generic store-bought sauce with duck skin, barely (virtually none) any duck meat.Beef noodle soup - forgettable, with that much MSG, water also taste good.close to $100 for 3 pax, first and last time i get sheared like a sheep. Maybe the reason they omitted pricing on their website's menu is out of shame?Avoid this money focused mill. Even the roast pork stall inside serangoon nex NTUC was far superior (Not that they were any good to begin with) Felt like a tourist being sheared while leaving.Alternatives to good roasted duck is Dian xiao er, or any other place that doesn't take you for a fool
3
Mediocre.There is NOTHING to rave about this restaurant.Their roast duck is slightly above average standards but way to fatty and oily in my personal opinion. Also, though the meat was pretty tender, it didn't have much taste to it - like the marinate hadn't settled into the meat.The rest of the dim sum and food were extremely average, nothing you cannot find in Singapore.This is a try once sort of restaurant that does not have any offerings that would attract you back the second time
1
Although I am a lover of fatty food but thought the duck is too fat for my liking. The duck bun is good though. What surprised me is the bad service and attitude. We ordered quite a lot of food and when we are about 80 % done, the manager came and ask if we want any dessert, we answered no and he showed an unhappy face and said "if you don't mind hurry up, there was a long queue". We are only there for 1/2 an hour (including waiting 10 minutes for the food) and we are fast eater. The manager also ordered the waiters to collect the plates while we were eating, at first I thought they wanted to change plates, but no, the replacement never came until I asked. Anyway I wont go there again, duck nothing to shout about and I think I prefer dian xiao er
