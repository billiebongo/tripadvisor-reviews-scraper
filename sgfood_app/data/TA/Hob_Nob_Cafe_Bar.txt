Hob Nob is a cosy cafe suitable for friends gathering. Food was alright at such price tag, however, my friend did not like it that the kitchen was an open concept. Our clothes smell of food after we left. Another downside is the waiting time. We were the only customers then but we waited for 20 minutes for our food to be served

The Hob Nob Cafe has a unique charm in that it is a quiet oasis in the hustle and bustle of Singapore. Its appeal lies in the fact that it does not attract hordes of people which the big chains such as Starbucks do. If you want a quiet cup of coffee and a sandwich, or even a more substantial meal, this is the place to go. Good food, excellent coffee and all in a tranquil environment

Hob Nob is tucked away on the 3rd floor of Far East Shopping Centre, which is opposite of Liat Towers and diagonally opposite Shaw Theatres. The café serves quite an affordable grub, considering its location in upmarket Orchard Road. Ordered the famous Fish and Chips, which was ok (I wouldn’t call it fantastic), but good for its price. The soup and coffee were ok too. I initially wanted to order the mussels as well but the dish wasn’t available that day. The café was quite quiet when I visited, so if you’re looking for some quiet spot along Orchard Road with affordable grub, you can give Hob Nob a try

One of my all time favourites. It's quaint. It's quiet. The staff is super attentive. The food is cooked fresh in an open kitchen. The decor is very indy & homely. The owner often walks over to your table, offering certain 'off the menu' items to customers.The must try dish here... without a doubt is their Tomyum seafood Pasta. It's one of those stand-out dishes that is unique to Hob Nob & you can tell by the succulence & juiciness of the seafoods that the quality of the catch (seafood) is excellent. Their fish & chips could use a better Tartare sauce even though the fish is excellent & very mushy on the inside. The thing that I love the most about this place actually is the vibe & the the fact that it's a hidden gem with very little people at the cafe always. It always feels like a private dining experience everytime I go there. Do visit this place if you're at Orchard & if you're looking for a quiet meal away from the hustle bustle. It shuts by 9:00pm so get there early

Went with a group of friends for dinner. Ordered the Fish Fingers while waiting for one more friend to arrive. That was good. But when the main course arrive, it was not really to my expectation. I ordered the Chicken Cutlet with Mushroom Sauce. When the food arrived, the mushroom sauce was quite bland and cold. My friend ordered the Carbonara, it was too watery.Another 2 friend ordered the Fish & Chip, those were relatively okay. It seems as though their fish is the only one that you should go for.Service wise, there was a few times the impression given to us was that they wanted us to leave despite there having no crowds

Tucked away in the totally underrated shopping mall, Far East Shopping Centre, lies a cosy and indie restaurant, called HOB NOB Café Bar. It’s on the 3rd floor, and it is a little hard trying to find the restaurant. Come up the escalator, give a right turn and keep walking straight. You’d see the restaurant… soon. If you can’t find the restaurant, take reference from the male toilet next to the escalators. Face in the direction away from the escalators, walk straight and give it a right turn. If all else fails, cry. Haha I’m kidding. Just keep walking around the 3rd floor until you find it. The mall isn’t that big anyway.Now fellow readers, mark my words – this dish, the Creamy Baked Dory Fish ($15.80) is amazing. Very, very good food. It is such a delightful dish with very well balanced flavours. It is cheesy, creamy, savoury and the best of trait of all – consistent. On both times we had this, the same satisfaction overwhelmed us. It is such a wonderful dish to have. A must try when you’re here. The dish is slightly pricey, but worth every single bite. Tummy Tyrant 2 and I agreed this is a dish which we will not get sick of, if we had to eat this every single day in a month. On the menu, you will realise that some dishes have a “Hob Nob logo” labelled to them. This dish has a Hob Nob label. I am sincerely excited to try other dishes with the label. Such a good dish. Such an amazing dish; worth every cent.Firstly, the flavours of garlic which is supposed to be in this dish is non-existent. The flavours from the chili overpowered the tastes by the garlic. Secondly, the prawns were not very fresh. It tasted like something I would have gotten at home, or maybe from a food court; perhaps worse. Thirdly, I had to add black pepper to the dish for some form of flavour, but my throat was left dry afterwards. My second attempt for my Aglio Olio tasted slightly better than this, but not very good either way. I was disappointed at the Aglio Olio which I cooked, but even more disappointed that I paid $13.80 for this plate of food.For the full review: http://tummytyrants.blogspot.sg/2014/03/hob-nob-far-east-shopping-centre.htmlCheers
