Eat First in East Coast Road is the son of the famous Sik Wai Sin Geylang who retired. He was the one that did all the Steamed dishes while his other brother did the Fried.
Very good food and not to be miss

This is great outlet for cantonese in the Eastside of Singapore. However service can be slow depending on the time you arrive. Be prepared to wait and then enjoy your food. But if you are one that cannot tolerate slow service (because there is only one chef), please go elsewhere. I have been coming here as well as his brother in Geylang. I love the prawns and deep fried tofu, the ginger chicken, beef kailan and the steamed fish. they are all delicious. Would recommend to friends and families who are patient with food

This shop is related to the one along Geylang which serves similar fare. The menu is limited but everything is cooked to perfection. My two faves are the Steamed Fish Head and Prawns with Tofu. The former is perfectly steamed and served with bean paste and liberal sprinklings of chopped spring onion and deep fried pork lard. Eat it with a bowl of fragrant steamed rice and it’s heavenly. Parking is ample and after your meal, there are a few coffee joints to complete a great outing

If you are looking for a nice Zi Char place in Siglap area, you can consider this place.Parking right in front of the restaurant. It’s air-conditioned. Food is reasonably good, although a friend complained it is too salty. The Steamed Fish Head is supposed to be the specialty and is good. You need to order early or it runs out pretty quick. Other things I like would be the Bean Curd with Prawns and Fried Kang Kong. Tea & water are all charged at $1 each. There is no service charge

Wok Hei beef Kai lan. Old fashioned Cantonese cooking. Simple menu but each dish made to perfection. The beef was tender n Kai lan crisp. The sweet n sour pork is the best I have had too- super crispy chunks of pork. Kang Kong is very tastyTofu with prawns also worth the calories. Will go again and again

There is no denying the food is good, but for the portion you are getting, it is very expensive. Example is the steam chicken you get maybe less than 10 pieces for about $15 dollars. You can get better value at other Zi Char stalls selling cantonese food

Food was not bad. Had the steamed pork with salted fish.After the first dish arrived, we waited another ten minutes before they brought the rice. And for that we had to specially go and ask for it. Then after we had finished the first dish, the rest hadn't even arrived yet. Been waiting more than 40 min before we found out they had forgotten about our other two dishes. Kitchen had 3 cooks but that didn't seem to be enough. Very very slow to get the food out.

Eat first is a family owned business originating from Lorong 15. Lorong 15's menu was small and cooked by the father who taught his skills to both sons. The younger did the frying and the elder focussed on the steamed food. Those who had the opp to eat the patriarch's food know his cooking had wok hei.Both brothers have gone on to own their own eateries and Eat First is helmed by big brother. Eat First has retained its small menu but it has the advantage of being air conditioned and has a car park right in front of the restaurant.The matriarch helps out at this eatery and knows her food and customers well. For newbies, steam fish head, water cress soup, mince pork with salted fish are good. Tao fu with prawns used to be good but under seasoned these days. Twice bitten already. Used to like the sweet and sour pork too. Tip: don't park here unless you have a booking specially on weekends or have someone with mobility issues. No grace period. Public car park across the road next to petrol station is your Tip: don't try and walk in with a big group on weekends. I was before the start of dinner session and place was fully booked.Tip: be patient. Restaurant may not answer phone. Tip: restaurant closed on Mondays except when it is a public holiday, when they will take a break on Tuesday insteadAnd finally if you are still reading, the restaurant is currently closed from 29 May - 2 June. It's hard work and they need a holiday

Don't be fooled by the single page menu and functional ambience. This is the place to go to for excellent Cantonese cuisine that makes you want to keep coming back for more. The dishes are well prepared, tasty and simply delicious. Love the steamed chicken and fried Kai lan.

A clone of Sik Wai Sin, a popular eating house in Geylang but now no longer operating, this was run by one of the sons. Food is just as good as what we used to eat at the father's! The steamed meat with salted fish, steamed fish, beef Kai lan & taufu prawns are their signature dishes and a must try. Simple eating house ambience and often packed at weekends and even for a Tuesday lunch. A must eat
