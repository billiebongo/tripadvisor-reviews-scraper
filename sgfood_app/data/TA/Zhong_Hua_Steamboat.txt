This is a place for locals. If you are not familiar with a steamboat. It's pan with one, two or three types of broth with a burner. You boil different types of meats and vegetables.
It's a lot of fun cooking table side.

This restaurant is located below Beach Hotel at the junction of Beach Road and Liang Seah Street and it doesn't have any signboard in English, just a small vertical one in total Chinese at the side of the building. There are two steamboat restaurants one on either side of this road junction and it's difficult to miss this restaurant as it is brightly lit and always with a good crowd.The business hours is from 10am to 5am and it is an "eat-all-you-can" concept, which include drinks. The charges from Mon to Thu are S$19.90 for adults & S$10.90 for chidlren whereas on weekends and public holidays it's S$20.90 for adults and S$11.90 for children. We had dinner on Chinese New Year's eve and there was a surcharge of S$5 each, thus making the charges S$25.90 per adult, but this unscrupulous once-a-year surcharge tradition is practised by the Chinese community everywhere in the world.What I love about this place is their fresh seafood and vegetables that they provide in abundance for their customers even in the wee hours.and the good service too. This restaurant is also easily accessible from the Bugis Mrt station.is just a stone's throw away
