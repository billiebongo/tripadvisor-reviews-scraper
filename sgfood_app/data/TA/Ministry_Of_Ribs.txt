Located in old estate area, surrounded by international schools, famous schools. It is at the foot of the MSCP. Depending on the time of visit, it is generally peaceful and Food here is good.

Brought my parents and family to this eatery at Pandan Gardens, and everyone loved it! Sure, service may be occasionally patchy with some waiting time, but they are a family run business, and they try their best. I value the opportunity to interact with the owners/ chefs in a family run business such as this one. In any case, trust me, the food is worth waiting for. The ribs here fall off the bone with the bonus of some nice crispy bits, tomahawk steak was finished with a blowtorch by our table - done just right, homemade coleslaw was so refreshing, I didn't get to taste the baked potato cause my sister inhaled it, garlic mushrooms had a nice bite and flavour from the garlic, and sausages were so good, that my sister continued stuffing herself despite being too full. I recommend dining alfresco - order a beer, and while you wait for your food, watch the owner's kids running amok and having fun ;)

Ministry of Ribs opened a new branch at Blk 416 Pandan Gardens #01-125/126 more than a year back. I have been frequenting this place because the food is good and it is near my house. The ribs is probably the best on the menu and my kids also like the fish and chicken burgers. Good to arrive earlier during weekends as it may get crowded but weekdays are fine. Service is good. Recently they opened a new air-conditioned section at the next unit

Revisited the Pandan outlet and see that they have increased their food offerings. We requested to be served the appetizers first but it all came out almost together. Quality was good and of good value.By 7.30pm, the place was packed and obviously the kitchen was not able to cope. We noticed food was being served to wrong tables resulting to be returned to kitchen. Basic service was efficient but you could see that the kitchen coordination could be improved. They need to get a more professional service manager rather than leaving the wait staff to "put plates on the table". Noticed that the chef owner made efforts to go from table to table which is a good sign. Overall, if you are going for food only, you would not be disappointed with the price you pay but be prepared to wait with the messy sequence of food served. Customers may come back for average / poor food but definitely less forgiving of poor service.

Went to this coffee shop as we were taking a break from cycling past pandan gardens. Very long waiting time from making payment to arrival of food. I took the opportunity to admire Pandan Gardens for its rustic charm. Waited around 45 mins fir food to arrive. I believe the kitchen is probably a one man show. The lady at cashier was professional however her other servers all fell way below average standards. I hope they can teach their staff some basic courtesy and how to pour draft beers properly. Ordered the honey rum ribs. It's delicious and certainly value for money. The meat was soft and flavorsome. The Black Angus steak was too chewy and didn't do due justice to the quality of the beef. It's really a pity as the medium rare steak was done up to the standards of what a medium rare steak should be. Frankly I didn't expect such high standards in medium rare steak in a coffeeshop. Worth trying but go with the more afford steaks rather than black Angus  Overall, it's great and I enjoyed myself as I didn't have high expectations to begin with.  The food in "Carving Board" Jurong East St 21 is much better but I somehow prefer this for its charming neighborhood location.

Our family had enjoyed previous visit at Dover and decided to try their new outlet at Pandan Gardens. Obviously the kitchen was overwhelmed and dinner took an hour to arrive though we were told 30-40 mins. Mushroom soup was excellent but the potato skins were poorly executed lacking in flavor and tasted awful. Both 2 different ribs were dry and not well marinated. Signature burger was a letdown compared to previous. Unfortunately, this outfit will be taken off our radar. Disappointed.

Having seen both branches, I think the Pandan Gardens branch is much nicer and spacious. The food is very good and I tend to overeat here. It is not located at a fancy place like Clarke Quay or Holland Village but a laid back HDB estate so temper your expectations. The staff is nice and friendly but if there is too many customers, they simply cannot cope. I have gone a few times and seeing the big crowd have to go somewhere else. Their busiest are the weekends evenings. Their ribs are definitely worth trying. I like their burgers too as the portions are big and tasty. Most things are reasonably priced

Visit their Pandan Garden outlet for dinner with friends, we managed to try some of their specialty like their flamming ribs and rib eye steak which taste great and the doner just nice. Not adviseable to order more than one main and 2 sides since their portion is big and i saw my friend struggling to finish their ribs, which ended up with teamwork to clear the plates. Anyway ordering potato skin for starter won't hurt, specially if it taste very good. They did have options for drink such as Erdinger for beer and other brand, as well as homemade lemon tea for non alchoholic drink. They also have rootbeer float which in my opinion won't go together with the heavy main, it's simply make you too full.Place was great and not so crowded, good to hang out and chat during normal days as well

Visited the place for dinner. The food indeed is very good and reasonably priced. However, I rated them 2 stars only because of 2 reasons :- 1. The waiters are not just aware of their customers. You can be calling them and raising your hand for 5 minutes and no one will notice you. 2. They allow smoking even though there is a no smoking sign. What is even more shocking is that the owner came out from the kitchen and joined the table of smokers !Still have a lot to learn..

Visited the outlet at Pandan Garden. I must said the ribs live up to it reputation. The steak is also good. Lots of varieties of beer being serve there. The Guinness with ribs is ace. It is outdoor and no air condition and also CASH term only. Therefore dress casual and bring lots of cash if your are entertaining friends or giving a treat.
