My brother's favorite place for mookata. The service was efficient and the staff friendly. The decor was a bit "mind boggling", very colourful wall murals with cement/concrete tables and benches. The layout inside was a bit haphazard and I was kinda "lost" as it was my first time there. We ordered a dinner set ($49.90) and the food was well marinated and good. A good place for friends and family to bond over food as you have to do your own BBQ. The 2 types of chili sauces offered was very very good. We wanted to buy some to bring home but they were out of stock on that day. The price of the meal came up to $57 including taxes and drinks, which is very reasonable in Singapore standards. The staff told us the sad news that this particular outlet in Serangoon Gardens is closing down that day (2 May). They mentioned that they have another outlet at Boat Quay. We will definitely check out their other outlet.

Patronized this restaurant for several times and never failed us before. We always like to sit at non air-conditioning area to barbecue the marinated meats since it was chilled at night. They always play traditional Thai pipeline music background. It gave us impression as if we are in Thailand. Staff were averagely friendly. We always requested them to change to meat, fish cake and prawns from their standard combo package. We also ordered for extra meats and mixed vegetables. Tips to share: It is advisable to marinate their pork with soya sauce and will taste even better after barbecue. Since we were regular patrons so we were given 10% discounts.We will patronize this place again.

I was there with my family for dinner and the mookata is excellent. For a big portion of meat, seafood, vegetables and some beer, it cost about $25 per person and it's considered mid-price. The soup base is also tasty and they serve live oysters too.

Very nice and authentic mookata, which is obviously it's highlight and what the place is famous for. You can find huge queues on weekends at dinner and see people eating mookata at almost every table. I also found their other alacarte food to be good, such as their Pad Thai, their Tom Yum Noodle soup, as well as their Prawn Cakes and Issan Wings, which are all recommended.Also, they do a really good value set meal on weekday lunches, where you can get a set meal of a main, a side and a drink for below $10! And the portions are pretty big too

Nowadays it is not necessary to travel to Bangkok to try their authentic mookata. They are several restaurants in Singapore serve good mookata, one of them is Tom Yum Kungfu, where decked out in cheerful Thai style decor coupled with Thai music even their chef is from Thailand. I have it in Serangoon branch.We have chosen a set for three pax. The portion was just nice, we sat outside since it is dinner time and more relaxed to feel as if we were in Bangkok but with office attire :(I will not make any comments about service excellence in this restaurant as I was enjoying my food there

average service, but i have to compliment the MEAT. its totally awesome. i have never been a meat lover. but the moment i tried their meat in the set menu, i fell for it and ate so much. i will return and recommend others to try. it will definitely be great if they could have more space for seatings as the tables were kind of cramp placed side by side. otherwise, all good

For those who are familiar with the eateries in Serangoon Garden Estate, this restaurant is best remembered as the coffee shop near the main bus terminus for .... more than 50 years?... If one remembers the Mubarak Bookshop, then became the temporary NTUC Income Supermarket.... it's on the same row of shophouses as HSBC. Anyway, it's been changed from a coffee shop serving Singaporean favourites like Chicken Rice, Cha Kuay Teow, Laksa ad home roasted coffee with beans roasted on the backlane behnd the shop. It is now serving Hotpot, dry and soup on the same charcoal pot. Real charcoal prepared at the same spot where they used to roast the coffee beans. This kind of pot used to be popular at one stage, and reappear now, at a higher price - I had a set wich wih GST cost almost S$50.00, a far cry from the chicken rice plates and noodles for less than S$5.00. You can order a'la carte but most diners order the sets. The pork in the set is well marinated, the prawns are super large, meaty and succulent. The sets are fairly generous, enough for 2 to 3 people. If you like don't mind adding heated food into an already heated body in Singapore humid 30+ degrees, it's worth ONE try. Then head off to Chomp-chop next time. Service is knowledgable and efficient, typical Singapore style 'coldness'... except when it comes to paying
