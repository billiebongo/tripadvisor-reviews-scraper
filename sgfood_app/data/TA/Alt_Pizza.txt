If you’re looking for a good pizza with pork toppings (hard to find sometimes) this is the place.
Nice selection of “create” you’re own pizza and sauces, meats, and veggies.
Worth a visit!

We popped in the evening on our way back to our hotel. Tried the "Lean and Green" something a bit different having broccoli on it but it was very tasty. Would happily pop in again on another visit to Singapore.

We were recommend Alt by numerous friends who all told us it was the best pizza - sadly and most definitely not the case. When the pizza turned up after well over an hour it was cold and soggy and not particularly tasty. I received an email a couple of days later from Alt asking for a review which I sent but never had a response - most likely an automated email where the replies never get read.I have had a couple of decent pizzas so far in Singapore but Alt has got a seriously long way to go to get even an average score in my opinion.

We’ve been frequent patrons for many years, most often the Suntech outlet, but Robertson Quay also.There have been changes and not for the good. The menu included best pizza in SG with quality ingredients, paired with USA craft beers on draft. Seems the new ownership/management has a new focus, disrupting the recipe that worked to build the success and our loyalty.Hopeful for a 2nd and 3rd chance, we tried and tried again, but the thrill is gone. They’ve altered the ingredients, portions and pulled the craft beer taps.No longer worth the premium dollar, simply ordinary. It’s better than many, but clearly lost the magic.We won’t be back. Encourage you to look for another

Great place for thin crust pizza. They cook the pizzas very quickly to order so there is not a long wait. Once seated, you fill out a form indicating what items you want from the menu. Soon, your drinks arrive and then your food. The pizza was of good quality and tasted great. I have had the pizza several times and really enjoyed it
2
Went to try their do your own pizza. Had pepperoni and fresh pineapple. I have nothing against using the fresh pineapple but they should have tried it first, it was sour and made me feel uneasy after tasting the pineapple ( made my tongue itch). Catching the attention of all 4 service staff was hard,we are the only customer that time. Truffled macaroni was good, lava cake was okay.
3
I went there with two friends and we ordered one pizza, one pasta and chicken wings as a side. The chicken wings were too salty, and the pasta was only average. It came with lots of cheese, but is not comparable to authentic italian pasta. We created our pizza ourselves, which was not bod, if only the toppings were not lukewarm. The pizza dough was thin and nice
5
Dropped by for dinner last year and it was very packed! The pizzas are known for being freshly baked in their fire oven in apparently 90 seconds. We ordered two pizzas and both in terms of sauce and toppings were excellent. Super flavorful, robust, the meatballs were tender and delicious and generous and the crusts were light and thin. I would have liked my crust just slightly thicker but otherwise the pizzas were fantastic.The service was also good that night, as the place was packed, the staff ensured to keep our waters topped up the whole time without having to wave at them
3
Sometimes the pizza is nice and sometimes poorly made. It is quite small so expensive for what you get. Quirky menu with not a lot that we like because of strange and limited combination,they propose a coupon if you download app and then discover the fine print which prevents you from using the coupon unless spending a minimum amount. Poor decision
2
Had a pizza for $20- no drink, no appetizer, just the pizza. I was craving the equivalent of Blaze at home, but this place was overpriced and the dough was weird- it rose on the crust but was super flat on the bottom. Skip it
5
Loved the pizza here! Lots to chose from and you can create your own! We signed up for their Alt Club and scored $10 off our meal! Would recommend this place & they also deliver via UberEats.
4
The pizzas we ordered were very tasty. However, the crusts were charred in a few spots. The toppings on the pizzas were not too generous. On the whole, worth a visit and even worth repeat trips.
4
Saturday night was spent here with the family where we ordered cheesy fries and 3 pizzas and a pasta food was of a high standard but unfortunately their house wines and beers were not almost tasted watered down ! Price for the above was expensive ($170.00) not really worth it for the amount ordered so well the food is good it's pricey !
4
Just visited last month. It was first visit but eating pizza would never been same in Singapore now . I have tried so many different pizzas here but i always missed that italian aura . trust me, this would be my favorite now. and would be visiting soon again.Go ahead and try..
5
I don't even really like pizza, but the pizza at Alt is rather delicious! Pizza bases are wonderfully light and the toppings are generous and delicious. The truffle oil addition - so luxurious! Definitely recommend Alt for delicious gourmet pizzas, although disappointing that they don't have a seafood pizza
4
Located right at the entrance of Tower four, they serve "the most delicious" pizza around Singapore. The customisation options are unlimited. They give you out small papers where you select and customise your own pizza. The draft beer is good too. Service is fast and good
4
Alt Pizza in Robertson Quay is not easy to find, it's in an alley surrounded by hoardings as construction work is in progress. However, as it was just 2 minutes walk from our hotel, it was an ideal place for a quick meal.The decor is rather garish,but the starter and the pizza were both very tasty. Service was prompt and friendly, it obviously helped that we were the only ones in the restaurant at 7 pm; guess it gets more crowded later. However, a number of delivery orders were being filled.Pizza prices standard for the area,but the house white wine was an exorbitant $10++ for a meagre 125 ml
3
I ordered the hangover pizza. Delicious and exactly what I needed after a night out. Unfortunately the pizza arrived cold, without any tissues, only the pizza box with plastic bag handles. I orders through uber eats, it's not the first time the food arrives cold. Definitely needs better packages and service from uber's side
5
My husband can be a picky pizza eater - so this was the perfect place! He choose exactly what he wanted on his pizza :) There are lots of chooses from the sauce, cheese, meat and veg. Both our pizzas were very yummy - the bases were so light. A tad difficult to find at the moment due to building work - could have been a bit better sign posted! We walked around for a good 10 minutes before we found it, but it was worth it
5
Pizza was amazing!!! We tried the short rib meatball pizza and the vegetarian pizza. Both pizzas were made well. The meatballs on the pizza were very tasty and the sweet barbecue sauce complimented it. The vegetarian pizza was nice because it was light but very flavorful too. I like the pesto sauce and the amount of veggies on it , almost convinced me that it was a healthy option! :-) We waited for a while before the pizza came but it was worth the wait. The place gets packed easily so I suggest you come early for dinner! Wine was reasonable too so all in all great place
5
I have just had lunch at Alt from their lunch set, which is a very good price. My friend and I shared a pasta and pizza dish and both were fantastic.
5
A lot of pizza in Suntec but for great service Alt Pizza is one of the better one. Although slightly cramp when full house but food is nice and make up for it.
5
Authentic pizzas with great tasting toppings , paired with some good wine and beer makes it a memorable meal
4
We visited for an early dinner in need of somewhere quick and well priced....this place fit the bill nicely. Quick service, clean restaurant and most of all fresh and tasty pizza.
Was able to do half and halfs with no problems. Would definitely recommend.
5
On our recent visit to Singapore (first week of March 17), we had food delivered to our hotel on two occasions - the second time because it was sooo good the first time around. We tried four different "signature" pizzas, all of which were delicious. Our favourite was the Alpha Lima Tango. We also gave a few different appetizers a go - the buffalo wings (Alt. Wings) are amazing, best we've had in Singapore over many trips. The Idaho Spud Cheddar Fries were also quite good, though we would probably go for an extra batch of wings next week. We also tried the spicy buffalo mac n cheese, which was very goo
4
Restaurant has multiple pizza choices or a DIY option. They don't not offer the standard Margherita, Hawaii but other delicious toppings. I love the pesto base as compared to the normal tomato base. Only improvement is the paper it is being served on which easily tears apart/stick to pizza when eating.
4
fresh,thin-crust pizzas with a variety of tasty toppings. the Hangover is the best, in my opinion. Wings and calamari are a good choice too
5
Alt.Pizza, no doubt, has the best pizza in Singapore. Quick fired thin crust little gems come to your table in a hurry, and the latest promotion ($15 for free flow pizza from choice of four signature 'zas) can't be beat. But, Chef, you gotta bring back your burgers! You guys had/have the best in town. Wagyu beef with rib meat and ground chuck as a base, super fresh ingredients, and an artisanal bun not from The NTUC down the road ... it's a greasy little slice of heaven. Please tell your adoring fans you'll bring it back for good!!
2
The service was ok, the pizza disappointing in taste.Not enough cheese.dough was mediocre at best not like in a high end pizzeria.The menu is a bit limited and the pricing not so clear.Did not feel everything was fresh.Soda cans too small.pizza size too small for the price you pay
5
The lunch special was a single topping pizza and drink for $12.It was a large pizza though! It could of fed my wife and I. we thought they were going to be small pizzas. Very good value (for Singapore)Both pizzas we got were very good. The staff was very friendly as well. Will totally be back
5
I had a great night in here a Couple of days ago. I had a fantastic blue cheese burger with smoked bacon, very tasty , and also a couple of slices of pizza. Everything is super tasty and the staff is very kind!
3
Great pizza crust, great pizza sauces, cheese quality itself was good, but they're quite stingy with the amount of cheese on your pizz
2
Decided to try Alt Pizza as it claimed to be one of the best places for pizza. While the pizzas weren't bad, they weren't great either. I don't see anything on the pizza that justifies the prices on the menu. There wasn't enough cheese nor ingredients on the pizza which made the pizza look so sad. As I said, decided to try out this place as I was searching for a new restaurant to go to at suntec city. Will not be going back to this place. As much as I do not like Pizza Hut, I reckon one is better off dining at Pizza Hut.
5
Chose the Buffalo Bill pizza. Totally tasty. No need for chilli flakes. Well seasoned. Nice crisp to each bite where thin crust ensure low carb meal . Sadly it was delivered in a messy lump by the rider. Looked like a squashed calzone. The risk of delivery. But i would definitely buy my pizzas from Alt. Very soon.
5
Had dinner on a quiet sunday night. The Truffle Shuffle was a thin crispy crust topped with parmesan, mozarella, mushrooms, onions and crispy kale (which I swopped with the fennel sausage). Easily one of the best pizza I had, with flavors on point, and generous ingredients. Would really recommend trying their mains if there's stomach space! Beer was pricey though.
4
I usually ordered delivery from their East Coast branch via Food Panda. Great pizzas and sides. Prices are reasonable.Also brought a business associate to their branch at Suntec. We were wow by their service. Quick, courteous as well as checking in with you regularly on the food quality or needing further orders on a very busy Friday evening.
4
Had lunch with family on a Sunday afternoon. Nice place. Good pizzas. However, my pizza was a bit too salty (think it was the ingredient: the meats). My son's bbq sauce pizza was a bit too spicy for him; think it was the sauce. Otherwise a good place for a decent pizza. The servers need a bit more training. This girl who was serving us reached across our faces to put the pizza down for my son, sitting on my right. Had to tell her to walk around next time
4
Tried Alt Pizza for lunch Wednesday which was a holiday. We were the only customers at first but the restaurant quickly got fairly busy. I had the Sriracha Chicken Caesar salad and my husband had the "Hangover" pizza. Both were excellent. We loved the ultra thin pizza crust. Will definitely be back
4
Went here just for a quick bite to eat and was quite impressed with the service, the speed and the taste of the food.They have all different priced pizzas to cater for all budgets, with really nice toppings on them - alternatively you can create your own
3
The restaurant staff are very friendly and helpful. I called the restaurant to find out if they were full and managed to secure a table immediately with the help of the staff on the call. It was an outside table but we didn't mind. After all, beggars can't be choosers. Low and behold, right after we had placed our orders, a member of the staff came up to us to ask if we wanted to move to a table inside because it had become available. We gladly took up the offer. This was totally the initiative of the staff as we had not indicated we wanted to move. Good job there!The food was tasty albeit a little on the pricey side. It is an average location where friends can meet up for drinks and finger food. Tables are placed rather close to one another, therefore not much of privacy. Definitely not a place to bring your date if you wish to whisper sweet nothings to one another. The better tables would be the ones next to the glass panel
5
Fantastic food and beer in the restaurants and for delivery.
The calamari is to die for, the pizzas and burgers are always perfectly done. Menu is wide and has some great ideas.
1
It used to be a perfect place for quick bite and beer. Honestly quality of food and service has been dropped tremendously since they have opened more branches. Is great to see them expanding but cannot keep up the good pizza as use to be.
4
This is my new favourite pizza joint for the non-fastfood kindda. They have some yummy menu options for their pizzas. Winner in our book. If they had some membership prog i would be ordering them every week.
4
I went for a quick lunch on a Sunday near the hotel I was staying at. I initially thought I would have pizza but could not resist the blue cheese burger as blue cheese is my weakness. It was fabulous! The side is either french fries or calamari and I got the calamari which was also great. Fun food in fun atmosphere. Great mix of people and families. The pizza looked good too
4
After a somewhat hectic morning visiting sites/sights around Singapore, Alt.com was just the sort of easy-going pizza place that we needed, with excellent dÃ©cor and ambience.An extensive, cleverly designed menu gave us more than enough options for our meal. Beer was cold, just as was needed on a hot and humid day.Service was slick and friendly.Good food, fair price, excellent service in a highly-priced part of the City. Recommended
5
Definitely one of the best eateries in Suntec Tower - the pizza menu is wide and imaginative, every single one is excellent. Highly recommended
4
Alt Pizza is a great place for gatherings for a party or even just a small get-together with your friends or family. I like Alt Pizza for a number of reasons; 1) the atmosphere, location and ambiance is prime. I love the restaurant because of the theme and the vibe it gives off. 2) I love the food. The food is tasty and it is very good quality. The food is also interesting, I love their DIY concept and I love the pizza dough balls and Nutella dish! Enjoy
2
This is a burger and pizza joint. Prices are about average for Singapore. Poor selection of over priced beers. Had the Marghuerita puzza with mushrooms extra and it was a little overdone but nice. Reasonable good menu selections and the tables are clean. They have outside and inside seating but the music is dreadfully loud
4
Loved the roasted garlic bread with spinach and cheese dip, the calamari rings with ranch sauce dip and the lean and green pizza. The place at Katong is a bit small and can get a little uncomfortable. Was not so impressed by the choice of drinks
5
I have been several times to Alt pizza, especially the one in Robertson Quay. Ordered different pizzas and my favorite is the truffle shuffle. I asked for a vegetarian version and the lovely staff accommodated me with smile! Service was super quick.Pizza are fresh, real taste of olive oil, truffle oil and vegetables. It is rare in Singapore to have good pizza without bankrupting and Alt pizza keep their promises. Also tried the icecreams and the (so dangereously good) donut pizza :PAtmosphere is chilled out and inviting to come back
4
We just had a pizza and soft drink at the Robertson quay location. Good hot tasty pizza which was just what we needed . Good service too but restaurant wasn't busy .
3
Quick dinner here after a week of Asian food! Pizza oven, thin base, option to create your own if you don't like the options. Couple of burger options and various sides eg. Wings. Limited range of beers available. Good option to keep the kids happy!
5
Had a lovely time at Alt Pizza with my friend, the decoration of the place is really nice I appreciate they actually care about it. The pizza are soooo good and even the crust is!! Recommend the truffle one but the DIY is awesome too. If you're not affraid or the calories the pizza dougnut is heaven, my friend took the new zeland ice cream hokey pokey, a delice too.Will definitely come back often
5
I eat far more pizza than is good for one's health and Alt tops my list for Neapolitan style pizza. I also eat far more meat that is good for one's health, but give the Lean and Green vegetarian pizza a try - you won't regret it
5
Been there multiple times, always a good place to catch up with bunch of friends who love easygoing yet lively vibe! This is by far one of the less pretencious eating place in Singapore! okay so now lets's TALK ABOUT THE FOOD! ALT got tons of selections on pizza, (but if you are that picky, you can always make one of your own); Their Truffle shuffle and the hangover are those highly recommended ones! Kale salad! the dressing is so freshing and you will probably consider use it all for once! I was also surprised their calamari's portion and size was bigger than other restaurants with same price
5
Chef Matt has taken his talents to Robertson Quay and East Coast area with two new Alt.Pizza joints!Hot, fresh, tasty pizzas are some of the best (if not THE BEST!) in S'pore! His burgers are even better (I'm serious!), and his starters are simple and straight-up yummy. And, best of all, you don't walk out the door S$350 lighter for dinner for four (how rare on this rarified isle!)Look, pizza and beer ain't hard to do, but here in Singapore it's become a bridge too far. Crappy and costly cardboard fare and formaldehyde on tap are the norm on the Tiny Red Dot, but Alt.Pizza has done things right. Delicious craft brews from Cali (huge fan of Knee Deep; not so much a fan of Lost Coast, tho), fresh ingredients, and a bit of street attitude in its decor make Alt.Pizza a "keeper" in foodie-heavy (and not always tasty...) Singapore. I wonder if Chef Matt and crew can do Mexican, or at least a Taco Truck?

We ordered delivery and were very disappointed with the "food" that arrived 55 minutes later. Pizza was soggy, fries tasted microwaved and the burger was cold and may as well have come from McDonalds. Would definitely not recommend this place for food. We can only assume that dinning in is slightly more enjoyable otherwise I cannot fathom how this place is still in business. Don't be deceived by the interesting menu or the wood fired oven. Go elsewhere.
1
I will not allow my "hangry" state of last night come between me and the truth, these are the facts•We arrived at 6:50 and left at 7:45, great right? WRONG! We left because we had not been served our pizza which was going to need another 15 minutes ?!?!? •we watched the staff screw up every single order they picked up from the counter, not an exaggeration, a fact, every drink or plate they picked up went to the wrong table. if I wasn't so hungry I would've laughed, but alas, the 55 minutes I waited left me with no energy to show such emotion•we did however receive our drinks and salad(after 20 minutes and my sav was warm, just saying) but I suspect due to all the screw ups we got someone else's order. Sorry! •the 3 tables beside us and the table behind us all complained about wrong food and the ridiculous delayso after 45 minutes we got up and paid for what we consumed. The female wait staff were lovely, they were doing the best they could but something was seriously wrong last night. It was busy but come on, if you can't serve the diners that can fit in your restaurant, cut back on tables!!! All I wanted was a nice, cheesy, spicy and thinly crusted pizza . Al I got was warm wine and someone else's salad (probably). Step your game up alt!
4
The concept is well executed and the menu offers a good variety of dishes other than pizza. The pizza is very similar to the Napolitan style. This place offers draft beer at a very good price. Staff could be a little bit more friendly and attentive. Definitely coming back
5
This review applies to the new location at 60 Robertson Quay location. Excellent burgers and very good pizza. There's a take-out only counter on one side and sit-down restaurant on the other side. It's well-priced for Singapore, and worth it either way. Service was good, setting was pretty relaxed, and it's conveniently located right next to the Singapore river and it's river walk. Thus, a great place to stop when strolling thru. It's away from the touristy areas, so it's a much nicer, quieter setting. The burgers were fantastic. Probably some of the best you'll find in Singapore. Also there were some great micro-brews on tap. Great place to meet with friends, come with kids/family, and/or have a business lunch/chat
5
Good variety of pizzas with good crust and ingredients. Reasonably priced food and drinks. Courteous staff.
4
Nice place. Easy and fast.
Pizza was good and well cooked.
French fries even delicious.
Price average to be here.
Kind people and good hospitality
5
Visited with friends for a Friday evening catch up. The pizzas are great - I'm a fan of thin crust pizzas, so are the nice array of tasty beer. The staff are friendly and the service is excellent. Highly recommend this place.
5
The food was great and the staff was friendly. Beers were nice. Best thing is the pricing. Its priced lower than the big chains but still much better pizza
5
The service here is fast and friendly, staff are attentive but not overbearing.
The pizza was absolutely delicious and the atmosphere was good even though it was a quiet night. Highly recommend!
3
Was intrigued by this place for a while when it climbed the tripadvisor rankings and at 1 point, reached top 10 or 20Was watching a movie at Suntec and popped by here for a late lunch at 3pm. Was surprised when I stepped in. It's a small casual eatery and the decor is squarely aimed at kids . Ordered cheese fries and a truffle pizza. Both are okOverall an average place, nothing special that would warrant a repeat visi
4
If you're looking for some good rustic pizza, Alt is the place to go....slightly pricy for pizza but well worth it. Thin crust, wood fired owen grilled, fresh toppings and a delicious sauce. That's pretty much what I look for in a pizza.Will definitely go again and again
1
So, we'd been looking forward to going here all day and arrived just on 9:30pm, and the place was busy! It was about thre quarters full. We indicate a table for two only to be told that they shut at 10:00, with last orders at 9:30. It was right on 9:30 so we said we could order straight away but they would not let us in! The person on the counter was adament. Bad service and no goodwill. We took ourselves (and our money) elsewhere..
3
I completed a small form for my order of a pizza and a burger. Firstly, the waiter incorrectly confirmed my order, "Just a burger"? then he tried for the up-sell , "any drinks?". I pointed out that I was ordering a pizza as well as per the form I had filled.Then a totally different pizza to the one I had ordered came along with my burger. I ate it anyway as I was hungry. The burger was okay not much beef in it though. The pizza sauce was far too sweet
5
Really great pizza and enjoyable experience. A friend of mine who was enjoying his birthday and felt like "beer and pizza" suggested Alt. We were very pleased to find delicious pizza and micro-brew beers on tap from the US (Kona Brewing Co from Hawaii and some California brewers). The staff are attentive but potentially have too high a table to server ratio so be ready to flag your server for a refill. If you are looking for a good experience and you just want pizza and beer, I highly recommend. The appetizers were great as well. I recommend the Buffalo Chicken pizza and the artichoke dip as well
3
shopping mall atmosphere; staff is friendly, value for money is good, but IMHO not much to do with a real Pizza.
would I come again: yeah maybe for a quick bite after work or after strolling through SunTech City?
5
Went here after reading the reviews and it did not disappoint. Good selection of craft beers. Then a wonderful pizza cooked to perfection. A must place to eat if your in Singapore. And so reasonable considering its location.
5
I worked upstairs(one of the towers). This is where i have lunch or dinner with colleagues and friends. I also like the pizza place on the basement but this is better. Must try the truffle pizza!
5
Spoilt for food choices at Suntec and was googling for something we've not tried before and Alt Pizza popped up. Decided to be adventurous and came by to try their pizzas after hearing the good reviews. Hubby and I shared the:Crispy Calamari Fritti - I appreciated the fact that they used real squid rings and not the processed mashed-up-grub that some places pass off as seafood rings. The batter was nice and crispy as its name says but we found it a tad too salty. Other than that, very nice size to share before your own pizzas. Buffalo Bill - hubby liked it quite a bit with the blue cheese taste adequately lacing the pizza. Generous amount of roasted chicken breast meat all over too. Truffle Shuffle - if you like the taste and smell of truffle and this pizza shouts your name. Like my hubby's pizza, generous amount of funnel sausages and roasted mushrooms and onions makes every bite a delight. The interior decor just screams young and hip! Not to mention their colourful and zany pizza box designs!! This pizza place is gonna give other established pizza places a run for their money. The others better watch out for this one.
4
If you love pizza this restaurant is good for you. But dont expect a real italian pizza like in napoli or similar. They offer nice topping combinations, which you wont get in Europe. Much better than many of those American Pizzas.Overall very good and fair price
5
It's a high energy, well put together place. Pizzeria, Craft beer, wings & burger what more one can ask for! And all of it is decently priced. The food we had; Pizza & Wings w blue cheese sauce were pretty good not outstanding, but the craft beer was excellent and also rest of the elements came together so well have to rate it a 5, worth a repeat visit.
5
Came here after finding the profile on hungrygowhere bursting with rave reviews. Was not disappointed. Can`t say anything about the craft beers, but the lemmy lemonade for five dollars was surprisingly good. Wish there was more per bottled, as the lemonade got over pretty quickly. Overall an amazing experience, with great staff (our friendly waiter was even willing to give personalized recommendations). The only bad spot of the entire experience was the veggie pizza which I suggest you avoid. However, one bad pizza is not enough to merit the deletion of one star!This place is a must visit for locals and tourists alike. It`s not very hard to find (located near one of the entrances to suntec city). I`m definitely going back
3
The location of Alt is at the lobby of a shopping mall and there is a taxi rank right outside. My friend and I went around 2pm and it was quiet hot inside as the windows are not tinted and we had the sun bleating in on us, no curtains either. The is a weekday special buy 1 pizza and get the 2nd one free which we opted for. We had the philly steak which was good but was more to a warm bread with topping but I understand that this might be there concept of pizza, a good enough portion of steak also but not enough cheese. For the 2nd pizza I ordered the hangover but the waitress gave me the wrong pizza I forget what is was but it had a cream base with chicken and cherry tomatoes, this pizza had no flavour whatsoever lucky we had the chili oil to dose it in with the chili flakes. I wanted the hangover as it had a pork sausage on it which I know would have flavour. Not sure why we got the wrong pizza as we were the only 2 customers in the place. Tables and seating are jam pack together so would hate going when crowded. There were 4 staff on and the chef sitting in the corner on his laptop we had to wave a call for service several times. I rated Alt as average solely from the service and not friendly at all. But in saying that next time I'm back in Singapore I would like to come and try the burger and the hangover pizza. Pizzas are also a little over priced for just 6 slices $18 ++. How about selling a pizza where you can have half of 1 topping and the other half of another? I will be back.
5
I love pizza and I love craft beer. This place never fails. I eat here with my family easily once a week. The pizzas are fresh and cooked to perfection. My kids love the plain cheese pizza and the staff are always super nice to them. They are 8&10. I highly recommend this place. If you are trying to be healthy have the spinach salad. It's really good. If not go for the hangover pizza. Oh and don't forget to order a Modern Times Blazing World......best beer they have.
5
I visited ALT Pizza today on the back of the excellent reviews here, I was not disappointed. I had the Idaho Spud Cheddar Fries to accompany the Alpha Lima Tango Pizza, everything was so fresh and tasty.If your looking for great pizza at a reasonable price look no further!!!!!!!
5
Great food, service, and value. We ate a pizza each both of which were great. They also had a great selection of craft beers.
5
Best pizza in Asia!! It's a big call... but it's the truth!
The chicken wings changed my life forever. The bbq and blue cheese sauce .... Damn!!
Please open near my house in Holland!!
4
There's really nothing bad I can say about this place other than it should open more branches.. its affordable pizza, great starters like wings and kale and apple salad.. and the craft beers.... yes the craft beers.. not a lot of choice but its a nice place to chill with friends over a few slices of pizza and a few pints...
4
The best thing about this place is its location and its staff. From the time you step in, you feel welcomed right till you leave the place stomach filled with food and mind filled with satisfaction.The best dish for me is spinach dip though my kids liked pizz
5
Wow!!!Walked over from Bugis for biz lunch and lucky I had the hotel umbrella- it poured on the way over... Arggggh!In any event, I finally found ALT (no thanks to bad directions to building 3 instead of 4) and what a pleasant surprise. Well worth the walk in the rain. Yep!The place was packed for lunch. A good sign for sure. One orders up their own pizza and drink on the order pads provided and in 10 minutes I had my custom pizza. No cheese, NY style thin crust, tomato sauce and lots of fresh roasted veggies I picked from the list. The pies are 11 inches and just right fur 1 hungry person! Prices are reasonable. Had a great blood orange soda- my wife's favorite. Thank you, ALT! You've restored my faith that there's great pizza outside of NYC and Italia...I'll be back. "Mangia!
5
Hands down best pizza in Singapore, if you want pizza don't go anywhere else it's really affordable (cheaper than Pizza Hut even!). They also have an app for ordering delivery to any address in the city with free delivery over $30 which if I come back on holiday will definitely take advantage of! Quirky, retro decor and great customer service, a must visit for sure !
5
I love this place. I think it is one of the best pizzas in Singapore.My family and I eat here about once a week. Besides the pizzas being awesome (try the Hangover) they also serve some great craft beers (try Modern Times Blazing World). I also think that the spinach salad has great flavor and not something you would be use to eating at a pizza place. My kids also like the Calamari and the bacon cheese fries.Try this place...you will not be disappointed.
4
My daughter is a pizza officianado, she simply loves pizza so we went along with great expectations - and weren't in anyway disappointed. Pizza was great, selection of boutique beers were a treat and the restaurant had a really great vibe. We tried a couple of the Californian brews, one occasion where Great Whites and Alley Cats worked well together! Fun spot, we enjoyed it

The whole experience felt very rushed and impersonal. Everything fromordering and the actual arrival of the food was too quick. Maybe that's why the pizza was unevenly cooked. Some of the appetizers were good, but nothing stood out as great
5
Delicious, crispy, thin based pizzas cooked in a wood oven to perfection. One 11inch pizza is enough per person if sharing a few sides. The Hangover Pizza is excellent, with or without the hangover. Order like dim sum with a pre written order form and then the delicious food arrives. Yum.

Went here saturday lunch with family. My father don't like to eat pizza as he used to eat local food but since my son insist it we give it a try as we passed by outside suntec tower 4. As we enter the restaurant service staff greeted us with smiling faces, present the menu in a polite manner. We ordered Alt wings with blue cheese sauce, bacon crab dip and artichoke and spinach dip as a starter all fabulous. We also try the ALT Burger, Hangover Pizza, Truffle Shuffle Pizza and Lean and green Pizza I can say that this is the best pizza I ever had. My father as a pizza snob also love it. They also had a loyalty program that when you get 10 pizza you will get 1 pizza for free, thanks to that. I surely come back again and again

We were looking for a good pizza place that was child friendly around the Marina area and found Alt pizza on a Sing foodie website. This is a fantastic place - really good thin crust pizzas, interesting craft beers and good simple wines, our daughter loved filling in the order and designing her own pizza and the ambience was nice and buzzy so my son could happily play with his cars on the table with no one minding. Also, great service!! Which many will know is not often easy to find in Singapore

Alt has always been my favourite pizza place, but now they serve what is hands down the best burger (both taste and value) in Singapore. Forget the hipster, overpriced, overhyped gourmet burger places now springing up all over Singapore. Alt serves a simple, hearty burger that punches way above its weight. The way a classic yum burger is supposed to be

I'm a bit of a pizza snob, and the pizza in Singapore (like the Mexican food) is, by and large, pretty dreadful stuff. Soggy, expensive, "is that stuff cheese?", the awful superlatives could go on. Then there's Alt.Pizza ...The Craft Beer Enthusiasts around town started talking about Alt. Pizza at SunTek 4 some time ago; and when the professional beer drinkers start talking about good pizza, we should all have a listen!It was, in a word, DELICIOUS stuff! Three of us split their Hangover Pizza, their 400 Degree Pizza, and their Buffalo Pizza (as well as a spinach salad) -- frankly speaking, I can't tell you which was better. They were all excellent pies!Roughly 11" in diameter, the pies run from S$14-20 each. The gas oven cranks out a flaky and crispy crust, and the toppings are top-notch. A great pizza is defined by its gravy/sauce base, and chef Matt White delivers big time! These pizzas, by the way, are in the European style (and not an American-sized behemoth) and very manageable. Delicious American craft beers are on tap at a reasonable price, and there wasn't a formaldehyde-laden Tiger or Carlsberg to be seen on the premises (thank heavens!)

This place was on my list of restaurants to try whilst out in Singapore. We stumbled upon it after getting off one of the stops that are on the HOHO bus tour. I knew the pizza would be good because from what I read of the reviews and it did not disappoint. It was delicious.My husband and I shared a pizza and some cheesy fries and this was enough for us.The service was great and prices are very reasonable.We had an added bonus - once we were sat down at our table, I realised that Ian Wright was sitting behind us. My husband being a massive Arsenal fan couldnâ€™t believe his luck...out of all the places to run in to him. He was so friendly and made this trip to Alt pizza one to remember

Caught up with an old friend over early pizza and beer. Pizza was excellent and the beer was cold and interesting. Service was spot on and despite that we sat and chatted for a long time with just the one pitcher of beer we were not hassled to move on. Very enjoyable and very nice pizza too
5
This is an amazing pizza place in an excellent location in suntec,just in front of the fountain of wealth.The pizza here is really amazing and not like one of those factory made pizza you find in big chains. The prices are very good for a restaurant like this.You can also design your own pizza's. They have good sides too,we tried artichoke and it was really yummy
4
We always see this pizza place whenever we passed by Suntec so I checked it on its review here in TripAdvisor. There are many great reviews so we decided to try it out one night. We didnt have difficulty in finding seat as we came a bit late already. We ordered cheese fries and pizza. They are DIY pizza wherein you have the control on what you want to put on them. Our verdict? its great! Filling even though its thin crust and comes fast after you placed your order. The cheese fries for me need to put some more cheese. We have another to go pizza place!
5
This is one of my lunchtime regulars as my office in centennial is close by. However, we are now going to start frequenting in the evening since the new golden village cinema is upstairs. Having eaten pizzas in many Singapore establishments I am amazed at how good the pizza here is and what good value the price is. This must be one of Singapore's best kept secrets. I have now started venturing into the diy pizza section where I can mix the various cheese selections with other delicious combinations. The key here for me is the great thin crust base and the variety of fresh toppings and well flavoured sauce base. The drinks are also well priced. I hope this place remains on the scene for many years to come as I cannot find a better pizza anywhere in Singapore
5
It was my first visit to Alt Pizza and I loved it. I had the C-food Pie. It was scrumptious. They only took about five to ten minutes to get the pizza to the table. The pizza was freshly prepared in a wood fired oven and even though I burnt my mouth with the first bite I couldn't stop myself from eating the whole slice hurriedly. I finished the whole pizza in ten minutes. Looking forward to visiting again. Thanks.
5
Tasty creative pizzas, solid beer selection, and a lively room. I would absolutely recommend this spot. Good for family or bros
5
Eat lunch here regularly since it opened, best pizza in town and the salads aren't bad either. Suntec is filling up with good eateries and this is one of its best....
4
It has a few flavours/fillings which are less common but tasty nonetheless. The juices go well with the pizzas.
5
Read the tripadvisor views on the small but perfect busy buzzy pizzeria in the heart of Suntec City, Singapore. Was dining solo on a business trip and wasn't disappointed. Thin pizza crust customised to satisfy your desires.... You write down what you want and it's made within minutes! Glass of Sauvignon, a soft drink and 11" pizza $40 including service - good value and great service

This got really good reviews on Tripadvisor and they are accurate.We passed it on route to our hotel, it's at the base of tower 4 of the SunTec centre.Has an interesting and eclectic menu of pizzas. We had the Buffalo Bill which had a kick, a make your own pepperoni and bacon and a hangover which had an interesting fennel sausage as part of the topping. Tried the Modern Times beer from San diego, bit concerned as it came in a tin but it tasted good. Cost was reasonable for Singapore. Service was friendly and fast and everything else about the restaurant was of a good standard, I would not hesitate to eat here again. Finding it is a bit of a nightmare
5
Came back as I was craving for pizza again, this place never fails me, awesome pizza as usual, great beer. Heard from staff that new additional craft beers are coming very soon, well that's great beer news. Excellent service provided again and again
5
We weren't sure about this one but were pleasantly surprised. You order from the menu or DIY (you write your own order down and give it to the waitress) there are plenty of options to choose from and the pizza crust is handmade and thin and crispy. The pepperoni is nice and the cheese is a good mix of cheddar and mozzarella. Definitely give this place a go if you feel like pizza

I found this place on TripAdvisor after lamenting about the high cost of dining in Singapore. This place is the cure! It is located right next to the Fountain of Wealth in Suntec City. Follow the signs for the fountain and Tower 4. It is probably easier to find if you exit the mall on the ground floor once you see the fountain, and look for Tower 4, Alt Pizza is on the outside of Tower 4 on ground level.It's a small place with glass windows overlooking the fountain so lots of people watching during the day and the fountain lights at night. You sit at one of the tables and fill out a form with your choice of pizza (they also have appetizers like salads, wings etc.) where you can choose one of the ready mades like the Darth Fader, or make your own. The pizzas are 11" thin crust so the perfect size to feed one person, and delicious! Most pizzas are around $12-$18. They also have 9 craft beers, and about a dozen wines by the glass or bottle all reasonably priced again around $10-$12. Fill out the form, notify the staff and they bring everything to your table. When finished simply go up the cash and pay. Simple and effective.The staff are very friendly and can help you with your pizza and drink selections. I will be back many times

Not been here for a few months and went with 5 colleagues for lunch. And it was even better than last time. We ordered a few pizzas and we also did a DIY one and they were all fabulous. Thin crust (the way pizza should be made) and delicious toppings with very good flavour. Very nice choice offerings and inexpensive wines and excellent service. In terms of value there is no better pizza in Singapore. I actually can't think of a better pizza i have had I'm singapore at any price.
5
We walked by this place and didn't pay too much attention to it, then after exploring options we decided to give it a try. What a surpriseThe food is excellent. Some of the best Pizza we have ever had. Staff is friendly and helpful. We really enjoyed it, kids loved the pizza tooWell worth it and highly recommended. Enjoy
5
We decided to eat here based on previous reviews here. Did not regret it! The pizza was great, and it didn't take many minutes from we ordered until we got our food.
5
Delicious meal with prompt service! We had the chicken caesar and a fungi pizza, both were tasty and came quickly. We also had some wine and enjoyed my girlfriend's birthday. The staff were always smiling and when they heard it was her birthday, discounted her bill. The atmosphere inside is cool and cozy, great for a night out or a date night

Came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon in the month of March - the place was not crowded and we were ushered into our seats quickly.Placed an order for a Crispy Calamari Fritti ($10), a Truffle Shuffle (thin-crust pizza) ($14), and an Americano ($4) as well as a cup of Chamomile tea ($4).The Crispy Calamari as an appetizer was serious - it was very crispy and yet not burnt. The dipping sauce was slightly tangy to the taste-buds. An overall very excellent appetizer.The truffle mushroom pizza came later - this was the exact opposite of the appetizer. The undersides of the pizza edges were burnt and this left streaks of charred crust on my plate as I tried to cut the pizza up. The center of the pizza was undercooked and soft. The layer of filling could easily be peeled off from the pizza crust (tell me this is not an indication of an undercooked pizza!). The caramelized onions were a nice touch, though the mushy and doughy texture of the crust left a bad surprise on our tongues (shouldn't a thin-crust pizza be crispy?).It was however a good thing that the servers allowed for a refill of hot water for the tea.The coffee was ordinary with nothing worth mentioning - it was dispensed from a standard coffee machine (Illy, I believe).For a place that has "pizza" in its name, and after hearing all the rave reviews on TripAdvisor, I would have expected the pizza to be much better, if not at least "cooked" (not "undercooked"). I will not return to this restaurant anytime in the near future
5
The pizza is simply superb! Tried the DIY pizza and both the tomato sauce and white sauce are good! The mushroom truffle pizza is very good too! Will definitely come again!!

Maybe it's just because there isn't any decent pizza in Singapore, but this was not up to our expectations. We went here the first night as it was walking distance to our hotel, and we didn't know our way around yet, so it seemed an easy first night meal. Well, the people are nice, and it looks rather cute, but I just don't understand the excellent reviews. The preset combinations are rather strange, but you can select your own, so that wasn't a problem, And with a thin crust and a hot oven, the food comes really fast. But the crust didn't really cook thru, so it was kind of mushy instead of crispy. Really not that appetizing. There is only one size pizza, about right for one hungry person. Two mediocre pizzas with a couple of beers set us back $75 Singapore dollars, or $54 US

I was in a business meeting around Sentec area and came along to this restaurant and decided to give it a try before my next meeting. Upon entering I was greeted of a friendly staff with full smile on her face. Staff are friendly and they know what they are doing, they are very knowledgable and made great recomendations about the menu. Their food was awesome, I was blown away with their alt. Wings with blue cheese dipping, good variety of drinks and beers. kudos to the management for keeping good quality food and professional service! Surely will come back but this time with my family and friends so they can also experience and enjoy what alt pizza has to offer
5
Visited Alt. Pizza with my family on a Sunday and the restaurant was packed. Nontheless, the food came quickly. The family's a fussy bunch but we down every morsel of food, along with the recommended Alley Cat Amber Ale beer. We ended our meal with a Nutella Doughnuts which was heavenly! Only thing was we really missed the Red Velvet Dip that was last Christmas' special dessert. Service staff was all smiley and prompt with our demands despite the busy night. Definitely coming back
5
Came on V Day & we have no reservation, the restaurant was full, the staff was very apologetic as they can't accommodate us right away, instead we were placed on their waiting list, and we were 4th on their list, after 15 minutes, I got their call, and so I got a table for 4. Though they were full house, we still got our food in a reasonable waiting time, hot and in very good quality. This could be the best pizza we had in our lives. Try the Philly Fanatic and Wings with blue cheese. Good beer selections too. I will definitely come back for more
3
We arrived just before 9pm which probably wasn't a good time to arrive as the resturants close at 10pm . Unfortunately part way though our meal the staff started to clean up and mop the floor, the smell of disinfectant was really strong and you could taste it on your food. Having said this the pizzas we had were really nice , with plenty of filling on both. Presented with the bill before we had finished eating as they clearly wanted to pack up and clos
5
Loved this place. Really like the concept too. Build your own pizza is encouraged but the ones on the menu are really inventive and delicious too! Really fresh ingredients. Reasonably priced too considering the location right in the city centre. Quite hard to find but only because Suntec Mall is an absolute maze! Very confusing. Don't give up on your search though because it's worth it when you get to Alt.
5
Came here for lunch one day. Was nice pizza's for a reasonable price and good selection of beers. Quite a quirky place and not too busy which was nice. Would definitely come here again.
5
Delicious food in a nice atmosphere. Fast and prompt service. Love the blue cheese dips that goes with the wings!
5
Fantastic food, great beers and excellent ambiance. The service staffs are very polite and knew the restaurant menu very well, and make a couple of good recommendations.

Alt is super conveniently located in Suntec city. The decor is unfussy and casual, and the staff are smiling and friendly - so, great first impression!We had the Garth Fader (Red pepper cream sauce, Mozzarella, Smoked Cheddar, Pine nuts, Onions, Artichoke, Cherry Tomatoes), and the Crazy for Kale (Kale, Pine Nuts, Squash, Goat Cheese, Mozzarella, Onion, Cherry Tomatoes), and a glass of Moscato and a Craft Beer to drink. The pizza crust is gorgeous - thin, light, and crisp. The toppings were very interesting but not sufficient. In the Garth Fader, the Red pepper sauce could barely be tasted, and definitely no pine nuts in there. The Kale pizza was definitely a winner but again, the squash and the onion made a blink and miss appearance.Overall, the experience was nice. Two things though, more generous toppings would be great, and definitely a few more veggie options would be welcome (though you can make-your-own)
5
Great place outside the fountain at SunTec Tower 4, really good pizza with (as you might expect) a little twist to their presentation. We liked the art background and were happy with the food and service. Their pepperoni and mixed olives were delish. Only thing about the pizza I would change would be to give it some base; I fold my slices and while small, the tip still hung which means too thin! Beef it up, bro! Wished I could have met the dude from Philly. All said and done, probably the best pizza I've had in SE Asia. The wings were gooooood! Bleu cheese ta boot.
5
Never thought you would find a pizzeria like this in an expensive city like SG. Very reasonably priced but top quality pizzas. From the pizza crust to the organic tomato sauce, to the fine cheeses and finished with the freshest ingredients, this is gourmet pizza at its best. And the craft beer selection on tap, you wont find them easily anywhere in Singapore, love the Great White beer, its crisp, clean and it did go well with my The Hangover pizza. This place is highly recommended, and also with their impeccable service, staffs are all smiles most of the time
5
I've been to altpizza a couple of times with my friends and family. Although it's a little hard to find. But trust me, it's worth it. High quality pizza, delicious starters and great beer. Wat more could one ask for. Truffle shuffle, buffalo bill & 400 is a must have. Wings and fries were awesome too. Especially the blue cheese dip with the wings. Highly recommended to all
5
My family and I live in Seattle and were in Singapore over the holidays. We were looking for a good restaurant for lunch and were recommended ALT. ALT is an awesome restaurant with delicious pizzas and great beer! Highly recommend Truffle Shuffle and ALT wings.Looking forward to checking out ALT again the next time we are in Singapore
5
A surprising new restaurant right outside Suntec Tower 4. You won't really be able to see the restaurant signage from inside the mall but once you locate it - its quite a find.Pizzas are top notch with a great crust and loaded with ingredients. The salads are solid and tasty. The price point is such that one could visit frequently and not break the bank. They have a good selection of craft beers to go with the pizzas. If one was adventurous, Alt also allows customized pizzas..although I was too lazy to design one. The weather was nice so we sat outside al fresco although there was the option of sitting in a large-ish air-conditioned sitting area. Point to note - if you seat outside make sure to gulp your beer down fast as the Singapore weather warms the beers down pretty quick. Bottom line - affordable tasty pizza and beer. Staff was friendly enough
5
A lot of my friends haven't heard about this place but I was lucky enough to have a friend take me there and have been back multiple times ever since! The pizzas here are as good as they get - they have a beautiful thin crust with a delicious base (soft, not too chewy) that makes you savour each bite. I usually start off with the Artichoke and Spinach Dip and a Kale and Green Apple Salad. The salad is amazing! It's so refreshing to start off the meal with it.The truffle shuffle pizza is what I always get - thank you to whoever thought of pizza with roasted mushrooms in white truffle oil. Buffalo Bill is excellent too. All of them have just the right amount oftoppings so you're easily able to try a variety of slices without feeling like you've stuffed yourself (again, get the salads as a side for a wonderful refreshing touch). You can also make your own pizzas too which comes in handy when I go there with my family (they're vegetarian and picky about their toppings!). Wash all this down with a selection of Alt's wonderful wine and craft beers. Love the Modern Times collection of beers.I really enjoy my evenings here - even after a selection of pizzas and craft beers, an evening there is easy on my pocket and stomach. Highly recommended and look forward to more meals there
5
ALT has unbelievably good pizza with some unique flavors. By far the best pizza in Singapore. A great place to meet up with friends for after work relaxing and have a beer.
4
Casual dim environment, great for after work pizza & drinks with friends. Pizzas were freshly baked upon order and can be seen from dining area. Little variety of appetisers but good enough while waiting for our C'food Pie, The Hangover and others
5
ALT is by far the best pizza you will find in Singapore. Creative menu and super fresh ingredients at a fair price. Nice job Chef Matt and team...keep up the good work!
5
had lunch here twice now with work colleagues and the pizzas are as good as anything I have had in singapore. But the big surprise is that they are almost half the cost. What a great find and worth a trip with the family.
5
Returned for our second visit, impressed once againAlt. covers every pizza with quality ingredients you can taste. The menu offers some unique craft beer choices not found around SingaporeServers were very attentive and place has a nice vibe.Definitely will be bac
5
Amazing pizza, the best in Singapore by far. Varieties of pizza, check out the menu. Location is good and great customer service. Must try: pizza donuts for dessert. If you need help with deciding from the expansive menu, ask for Matt White, the owner & the pizza master. He will be more than happy to assist you
5
Definitely a great experience. The ambiance is vibrant with a very visual interior design. They serve amazing pizzas, but you won't find the common Italian pizzas there, but very creative pizzas with different base sauces and high quality toppings. I personally enjoyed the DIY option, where you can build your own pie. The beverages are great too with very reasonable priced beers and wines, which is very difficult to find in Singapore. Alt. rocks!!
4
Based on the rave reviews and close proximity to my office, I decided to give this a try. We had the buffalo wings, Philly Steak Pizza and Green and Lean Pizza (will not order this again, broccoli on pizza is just wrong). It was alright, a place I would come back to. I love the crust, it's thin and gourmet, and the price is really what makes it a great deal. For the quality of the food, the price is excellent. A great after-work hang out or even a casual date
5
Everyone should experience ALT Pizza...the offerings are definitely a different style of fresh oven baked pizza that Singapore has needed for along time. You have to try the "Buffalo Bill" and the "400 Degree" along with the great selection of hand crafted beers from the west coast of the U.S. Great location at Suntec City Tower # 4 and easy to get too...don't forget to leave room for desert, Pizza Donuts are a must..
5
Went to try the Pizza at Alt Pizza and was blown away. Started with some wings and was super impressed and then ordered three pizzas which were super. I can't remember all the names but one was a buffalo chicken type pizza with blue cheese which I will definitely get again. Also had a truffle mushroom pizza and one with jalapeÃ±os and pepperoni. All were great. Loved the crust too which makes a great pizza better. Let's not forget the microbrew beer and you can't leave without having the pizza doughnuts. Cinnamon sugar on pizza crust with Nutella and red velvet cheesecake spread. I ate way too much but it was too good to stop. I'll be back and so will my friends.
