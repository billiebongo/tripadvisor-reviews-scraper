Reasonable prices with seating available. Soup buntut at $9.50 comes with a bowl of rice, there are about 4 pieces of oxtail. Three types of chilli paste are available. Service is fast. Good place for a meal or for teatime.

Love Indonesia food especially with their sambal chilly that comes with the rice. Teh botol is one of my most favourite except getting it from Indonesia itself. Very nice place for lunch and dinner and loving their interior! Enjoy your Indonesian food!

Thereâ€™s a lot of emphasis on upmarket dining in Singapore, so Tok Tok was a great little find in the Orchard Road area. It has a real street food feel, sort of an Indonesian fast food place.Great service, good food that arrived quickly, and cheap. Felt nicely authentic.Recommended if you need a quick snac

It's never easy finding something reasonably priced and tasty in mid to upmarket orchard road malls. Tok tok is one of those cheap and cheerful places. It sells Indonesian street food, so expect lots of fritters and kecap manis. What I am most impressed about is the different types of chilli and condiments they have available. Portions are a little small but for the price and location, It's about as good as it gets.

I just finished my business and was looking for a place to eat. By chance I saw Tok Tok and ordered takeaway so that my family can enjoy.Ordered Ayam Penyet and Sop Buntut takeaway. They packed them neatly.It was still warm when I reached home. Both my wife(Indonesian) and son enjoyed and would bring my mother in law arriving this Friday to eat during her stay in Singapore.If you are around 18 Ann Siang Road or Somerset 313 do go and eat at Tok Tok

My colleagues took me here and I really enjoyed the food. They have a nice variety of Indonesian soups and it both tasted and felt like being in Jakarta. Try the corn fritter and the satay sticks. I also had an equivalent of chicken noodle soup which was very nice

All items on the menu are served in porcelain bowls or metal plates. Rather authentic to Indonesia's street food scene and very much reminiscent of Singapore in the 70s.The ayam goreng for the ayam penyet set was well fried. The sambal was hot and delicious. The rice is less than a bowl and would not fill a hungry man. The noodles we chose were delicious and the accompanying soup was like asam soup with vegetables...tasty. We definitely have tasted better food, especially the deserts, while in Indonesia. Though I admit that this place would comfort Indonesians with memories of home through its decor and personable order/cashier lady

Stumbled onto the Ann Siang branch of this chain On a Sunday lunch and we were the only diner during our visit. A slightly worrying start, we order the staples I missed Mei bakso, beef tendon, Ayam pencet, sate was excellent, noodle dishes pretty good. Ginger tea was nice. Best thing was the prawn crackers on the shelf and the sambal sauce specifically for the mie. Will be bac

Been tried it's soto betawi and soto mie and chendol. For the soto mie, I would give OK rate. Nothing special. But for the soto betawi I would give great rate, it taste quite similar with original one. They sell some fried stuffs too eg. bakwan jagung, perkedel, kerupuk, etc etc, but the price is quite expensive (for me). But still, if I'm missing local Indonesian food, I would come again

We were highly recommended to this place for the soups. So with great anticipation, we visited the bright and cheery shop at Orchard Road as soon as they opened. We ordered many different dishes to try their local dishes and desserts. The oxtail from the Soup Buntut was very tough, the Soup Betawi was slightly creamy but interesting, and we enjoyed their noodles best, good aldente noodles with nice sauce. Some of their dishes could be served with a bowl of rice, and you need to know, before too many carbo dishes show up!! The desserts are edible. Prices are rather high for street food, so be prepared to pay.
