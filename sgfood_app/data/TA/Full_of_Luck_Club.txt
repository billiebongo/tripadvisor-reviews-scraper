been a fan of full of luck club esp with the use of 1 for 1 on the entertainer app. the food quality is there but portions are on the smaller size. sugges to order more dishes to feel full. overall, recommended!
4
I tried the bao that is small and cute.
It is smaller than I imagined , but It tasted nice!
Must try when you visit.
5
Nice food and environment! The soft shell crab taste so good! The bun is small but also good! Even vegetarian can find some variety here. Will visit again!
But if u want dim sum, pls double check with them, seems they only available in weekend?!
3
Dining experience was ok.
Food was average. Price was fine.
The dishes looks more creative than the usual Chinese restaurant
5
Went to Full of Luck Club with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised by how nice the place was. Restaurant is tucked cozily in Holland Village and the food was good. Personally I liked the Ma Po tofu and the truffle crab fried rice
4
Various types of unconventional tea with interesting flavours. The mini baos are cute and delicious. I love the fried cordycep flowers. We enjoyed all the food. The only gripe I have is the honey char siew is way too sweet.
3
Portions are relatively small and may be fun to visit for an experience. However the food is not memorable to warrant a second visit especially given the price point.
3
There were 3 instances where I tried to get help from one service staff who ignored me every single time I reached out.. very unpleasant. Either she wasnâ€™t alert enough or she was not interested
3
Walked by the place and got attracted by the interesting menu especially its bao.Ordered some bao, hor fun, dim sum and BBQ pork. The food quality is ok with room for improvement. The salt egg prawn and the chilli softshell crab bao are good ideas but the bao can be served hotter and the salt egg/chilli sauce can be more refined. The BBQ pork is ok, would be better if there is more sauce.I would take the dim sum out of the menu. Just focus on having a few great dishes rather than a great variety you can't execute on
3
First visit here. The portions are small but most of the dishes were good. The chat siew and braised pork belly was tasty as was the fish noodles. They charge for water - a practice I think is odd given that they charge for towels. Worth a try but note that it is pricey
3
Average to above average food. Nice ambience. Friendly and patient staff. The char siew was delicious and generous. Liked the little touch of fortune cookies at the end of meal.
4
Great variety of Asian cuisine- with both individual mains and side dishes for sharing. Portion was reasonable, service is good
4
This is my second visit. Food is still good. One suggestion I hv for the restn is not have so many restrictions when paying via voucher.
5
Love the food and drinks. Always reinventing themselves. Service is good. Claypot rice is our fav and the crispy kurobuta pork is to die for.
3
restaurant has an interesting concept and decor. food portion are on the smaller side , bill size was made more manageable with the use of entertainer app.
2
The menu is extensive, sadly the good ones are very limited. We ordered 7 dishes and only enjoyed 1. The Char Siew is suppose to be good but all we can taste is sweetness from the sugar. None of the savoury sweet. It's just sugary sweet. The smoked duck is dry and nothing to wow about. We had better duck elsewhere. The baos (bun) are pretty good but it's so small. We had truffle egg white fried rice. It's interesting but it's lacking the wok hei. Craypot is bland. Signature chicken wings that we waited 20mins for. No idea why it's signature coz it taste like CP. The fish is good but that is because it's fresh. The rest are forgettable.Now about the service. They can go easy on the # of times they are clearing the table. Aleast 5 times and it does make us feel they are rushing us off. We will not recommend this place and not likely to retur
5
~my 2nd visit 2017Feb for lunch and we ordered a range of the chef's recommendations from the manager who is top notch, he's a true service oriented guy with great table side manner!Moonlight Truffle Beef Hor Fun - YUMzPulled Pork Spring Roll with Yuzu Chilli Sauce - YUMz x3Li Bai BBQ Char Siew - YUMz x2Stir-Fried Radish Cake with XO Sauce - YUMz x3once a while will be back again
5
Don't be fooled by the attractive prices on these tiny little buns. They add up!! I had the salted egg and soft shell crab. Both very yummy. A bit carb heavy if you're not into the buns tho. I also adore the chicken soup. So thick n delicious. And of course the fortune cookies are always fun...
5
Nice food and reasonable price. Good environment and place is very convenient to find. Place us convenient and easy to find . Not so clouded. Food was good and nice. Not oily . Staff Friend and keep asking us for any dessert . Recommendations the signature food for us when we don’t know where to start before placing our orders
4
Interesting take on the traditional dim sum dishes. We loved the XO Radish cake, truffle beef Hor fun, honey glazed char siew, eggplant claypot and butter cereal soft shell crab. There is quite a selection of mini paos- Unique way of doing small paos with novel fillings like crusted mushroom and salted egg prawn.The baked mini egg tart with black sesame was a disappointment. The pastry shell was not crispy Nor fragrant and the black filling wasn’t very tasty.Prices were reasonable but they do charge for water and the wet towel
4
The black sesame egg tart and truffle bee hoon was very nice. Little pao very cute. Enjoyed good food.
4
Novel and tasty dishes at this modern Cantonese eatery. Great for congregating with friends but less appropriate for business meetings.
4
food is good but quite expensive. wouldn’t go if not for entertainer app that gives 1 for 1 mains. the signature baos are extremely small too.
4
Atmosphere was special, but portions were too small for a grown man. Especially in the case of the signature pork.
3
this is my second visit to this restaurant , food are satisfactory , but service needed to be improve .
5
Had a great time at Full of Luck Club with their interesting and delicious food choices! Service was awesome too!
4
The food was pretty good particularly the cereal soft shell crabs. We did ask if the onsen egg that came with the claypot truffle beef could come separately, which it did, but still in its complete raw form....
2
Very different from my first experience where i find the food quality and ambience perfect and enjoyable. Yesterday, we waited 45min for the famous Char Siew. We almost finished the other 20 dishes that we ordered, and the Char Siew has yet to come. Overly sweet and hard on the crust. Very disappointing. I really wanted my family to enjoy the charsiew. I feel embarrassed. For such pricing, i am really willing to pay to enjoy the novelty and quality. But I dont have such confident to go back and try. Also, there are several items not available on the menu but we weren't told when we ordered. Quite inefficient and annoying.
5
The food was very good and the price is reasonable for the service and quality of the food.We did not wait for the food to be serviced.The relaxed ambience is a place to have lunch/dinner with friends, family and loved ones. Furthermore Full of Luck Club restaurant is so conveniently located at the exit of circle line Holland Village MRT.I greatly recommend this restaurant to anyone who love good food
4
Went by here on a Sunday afternoon and the place was rather empty but this also meant that the food came rather quick. I particularly liked the butter flakes softshell crab. Their baos are unique because they combine different cuisines (the fried chicken kimchi one was amazing) but also keep in mind that the baos are rather small sized so ordering one would definitely not be enough if you don't intend to order anything else.
4
MUST order the honey glazed char siew. Worth every penny and calorie. The beef Claypot rice is a yummy dish too.
5
Trust them to jazz up Favourite classics like chicken with special sauce..Liu Sha custard .. the char Siew is to die for.. and many other small eats ..will be back to try More of their extensive menu
2
Got our order wrong and still tried to pass it off as what we indicated in the order chit. Luckily it was clearly supposed to be a RICE dish and there was no rice!
4
We ordered beef with red wine source, seasonal vegetables and seafood tofu claypot. All dishes are very nice!
1
I was there with family. Service crew are not passional about their work, some even showed attitude towards neightbouring tables. Food is really off the expected standard with hefty price tag. Would not recommend at all.
2
most dishes are served lukewarm.fusion recipe not very right. Food are average and overprice.Deco is nice and well don
3
Overall food was ok, i did specify that i would like to have one serve of Char Siew kept for me. This was also reconfirmed when i placed by order. After waiting for 15 mins, I was told there was no more char siew left. This is disappointing.!
4
Checked out this establishment as they were having a 1 for 1 noodle deal. Ordered another claypot rice as we have 3 pax. Portion was just right for 3 pax, although plating didn't look generous when the dishes arrived. Beef truffle hor fun was Good, as recommended. Gotta try it. Not sure if I will be back, as food prices are not as competitive as their nearest competitor
4
Ordered the crispy hor fun and seafood stewed noodles. Both were pretty decent, but my friend and I both preferred the hor fun to the latter. Didn't have to wait long for it to come. Expected the mini baos to be bigger and more impressive but they turned to be really really small and I think the quantity also means you don't really get to savor the taste as much
4
Went on a weekday and ordered lunch set A and C. The beef set in set C is very tender, but I feel it would go better on horfun than rice for this set. Super worth it to add on the +$6.50 to complete the meal with a soup, drink and dessert. Just the soup alone is nice and worth that amount. Would go back again during lunch
4
Cantonese bites located at heart of Holland Village. Our 2nd time here. Theres 1-1 UOB card promo till end of Oct for all noodles ordered.
4
we had the noodles at this restaurant. very satisfy with the food. they have a unique and interesting menu. will try the bao on our next visit...
5
The staff were very attentive to our needs. They actively advised us of the ingredients of the food after knowing our dietary restrictions. Nevertheless, we really enjoyed the food and will definitely be back again to try the other dishes!
4
Food was tasty. Like the herbal chicken which was so tender and flavourful. Enjoyed the other dishes as well. Recommended!
2
Serving of dessert took more than half an hour. Food was ok, waitresses not too friendly. Ambience is good.
2
Restaurant and menu looks real good. But staff cannot understand English and are not properly trained. Food is average in quality so was rather dissapointed and would not return again
4
Three of us had dinner here. Reservation was made and we sat at a spacious corner table. The tables were placed close to each other. There was one for one UOB promotion for noodle dishes. We ordered the King Prawn Crispy noodles which came with two prawns, the waitress poured the gravy over the noodles. Found the dish a bit dry and can do with more gravy. The other noodle dish was Yuan Yang hor fun, it was tasty. The crunchy medley of vegetable came with some kai lan stem, mushroom, ginko and lily buds. The portion was small. The Char Siew was good, it was served hot with a sweet glaze. We ordered two mini baos, they were OK but not great. The restaurant charged 50 cents for warm water. The place was cosy and not too noisy. Staff was friendly
3
First try of this restaurant and found that it is by Li Bai. We ordered few dishes.Assorted mushrooms - this very nice, not sure how it cooked but taste very good.Scallops fried rice - this is nice with salted egg, century egg and scallops. A new combination which I felt interesting and good.Claypot Rice - failed to my standard. It just taste like mixed rice.Dim sum - tasted averag
1
I reserved under Chope and they wanted to give me a table that is in the middle of other tables. Finally they gave me a corner seat and and the aircon was blasting at me. Also they served our food one dish at a time compared to the other tables which shows biasness against me. Will never come back because of their bad service and the food portions are very small.
4
had the set lunch which is of fantastic value - 2 course starting at $9 and that was a lovely salted egg corn and an average claypot mee tai mak (better ones at the hawker centers). loved the top ups as well. overall would recommend lunch her
4
Food was really really good!! Not to miss out the drinks and desserts too!! Will definitely head back for moreee!!
3
Food wasn't too bad but portions too small for the prices... especially the baos! But decor was very nice!
4
Greeted my friendly staff, place is very spacious and relaxing for gatherings. Food menu is interesting and must try their drinks!
5
Best quiet and new place for good food. Although the restaurant is new , service is good. Must try. Be sure to ask for their recommendation and best selling dishes. They will sure to upbeat the older restaurant .
4
Modern yet also tasty Cantonese cuisine. Try this place if you're get bored with the oldies (but goodies).
5
I will always appreciate the combination of good food, drinks and service (not forgetting ambiance too!) I really like their take on modern Chinese/Cantonese cuisine. We love everything we ordered including Yuan Yang Hor Fun, Genghis Khan Pork Ribs and their ice-cream bun dessert.
3
Place and ambience was good but felt that the decor could have been much better. Staff was ok and paid attention to orders and requests.Food was good but it seems that the helping has shrunk a little as the baos seems to be smaller in size as compared to my previous visit.The duck was still good but it seems a little dry this time round. Drinks a little expensive and should be reviewed
3
Arrived with warm welcome. Shown to the 2nd level that has very nice ambience. However the tables are too near to each other, no privacy at all.
2
There is nothing good about this restaurant which I could think (except perhaps, the cute complimentary fortune cookies)It advertises its afternoon happy hour at 2pm-6pm on the Chope.sg website, but upon arrival they insisted that booking website was wrong. Nice try there; I know full well that the site merely lists the info which the merchant provides to the booking platform - Any mistakes are clearly the merchant's own - but they did not want to honour it.The server then recommended the set meals with cold brewed coffee. It later turned out that they didn't have any coffee, so it was back to the menu again.When we finally ordered, the mains (we're talking about Hor Fun, Claypot rice) weren't even as good as that of Holland Village Centre - just 300m away. Now we're talking about $14++ to 16++ (excluding taxes) charged per main course here.The "baos" (buns) were much better in quality. The salted-egg shrimp bao and the soft shelled crab baos were quite innovative, and I have not seem them elsewhere. Just as innovative were their incredibly tiny sizes - the buns were half the size of my fist. With the cheapest bao at $3.50++, it did not make any senseto try all they had to offer.This restaurant tries too hard to associate itself with Li Bai, a restaurant which is superior by far. If you enjoy Li Bai, stick to Li Bai
4
We came to Full of Luck Club because we had a $30 Chope voucher to use. We got a drink each, a starter, 2 baos, two meat dishes, a tofu, and a fried rice which was enough to make us quite full, but not bursting. It came out to about $90 total, so $60 after the voucher. We thought the food was yummy, a lot of classic Chinese dishes made more modern (such as adding salted egg yolk or truffle), but the prices wouldn't have been worth it without the voucher.We went on a Friday night and the restaurant was pretty busy, so I would advise pre-booking. It was hard to get the attention of the servers after the food had come out (I think all the dishes came out within 10 minutes of ordering and then the service staff completely neglected us). While we were eating, they never refilled our water glasses, but after the plates were taken away they refilled the glasses non-stop which was rather strange. The staff seemed rather young and not well trained.
1
Food are not good, nowhere compared to the normal decent dim sum place, but not cheap. The services are extremely slow. Overall system and process need a revamp to improve, we will definitely not to visit again.
5
highly recommended the bao which comes on different flavours. the noodles taste good and can share for 2 persons.
5
Oh i love the salted egg corn that they serve here.
The moonlight hor fun is also great, with a generous serving of beef and hor fun.
5
second visit and im sure im gonna head down for another meal soon! Food was really good and on point. its getting really crowded recently so its best to make a reservation before going down. With more crowd, the place is a little noisy and if you are sitting on the ground floor at the sofa seats, its pretty cramped for a cosy dinner
4
We ordered the XO radish cake, truffle beef horfun, and stewed fish noodles. It would be been an expensive meal if not for the on-going 1 for 1 UOB promotion (only applicable for the noodle dishes). Without the promotion, I wouldn't consider the food worth the price - portions were really small (definitely not for sharing). Pricing aside, the food was pretty good. While the beef horfun could have done with more wok hei, the gravy was flavourful and the beef slices were tender. The braised fish noodles were interesting - instead of rice/egg noodles being used, the springy noodles were actually made of fish (tasted like fishballs in noodle form). The XO radish cake was especially delicious - fried to a nice crisp and coated in a sweet-savoury sauce. It wasn't overly oily either. In all, this place warrants a return.
3
Baos were terrible. Soft shell crab and drinks were amazing ! Good and attentive servers. Value was alright not bad!
4
The starters ordered was quite good- fried soft shell crab with butter cereal especially. The flowers of life was okay but a little overly seasoned. Do not recommend the crabmeat truffle egg white fried rice, as it didn't have much taste of it's own, let alone the truffle taste. The Fok Lok's Milk Tea was also just okay, not spectacular, and could not really taste the oolong nor milk tea. The ambience on a Sunday evening was relatively quiet, good location located right outside Holland Village MRT station. However would appreciate greater number of toilets (just one mixed cubicle), and more space between tables (could see the couple next to my table eavesdropping on my table's conversation).
3
Food was ok, small portions. Bao was good. Service was so so, slow in serving water. Char Siew was also good. Good for families.
3
Casual hipster Chinese food is the best description for this place.Food is decent, for three pax (two females) we had a wagyu horfun, xo radish cake, kurobuta pork belly, spinach tofu and two pork baos.Skip the bao. The traditional ones are wayy better - Westlake is a good option. Everything else was decent with the two ladies particularly enjoying the tofu.Service was a bit spotty, despite having made a reservation, there was no table set aside and so they had to shift people about which isn't all that pleasant for anyone
3
We were seated directly under the aircon & have to ask them to lower the temperature. We saw other diners complained about the coldness too. The waitress didn't repeat our order, thus, missed out our tea & white rice. We have to keep reminding them our food order. Food took quite a while to come. Food portion was small but tasty.
5
Ordered a few dishes to share amongst ourselves, and the quality of food was consistently high. The honey char siew and claypot mee tai mak is definitely a must-order! The lunch sets are very value-for-money too.
5
Yummy interesting food. Surprisingly good that brings traditional Chinese comfort food with a twist of fusion flair!
4
Food is slightly on the pricy side but pretty affordable if you've the entertainer app! My friends and I love the mee tai mak the beste, the bao was quite dry though.
4
Improvements needed, staff were not available to attend to guest that walks in. Food average and a little over priced. Good experience overall.
4
The food exceeded expectations as I saw mixed reviews online . The crispy pork dish is the best . The service staff were not very attentive and slow
3
Food was delicious, but the price is on the high side for the portion. The waiting time for the food to be served was a little long as well
5
Food was slightly above average, would if have been better if the portion of the claypot was bigger. Service was not bad
3
Food servings were much smaller than expected, taste was fine. Overall a bit too pricey for the serving size
4
Was pleasantly surprised by the updated menu. Now its a full fledged restaurant rather than being perceived as a bar snack kinda place where drinks take centerstage rather than the cuisine. Menu is not overly huge but its comprehensive. Flavours are distinctively varied so no two dish taste the same. Drinks menu is pretty awesome too after the makeover. Alcoholic and non-alcoholic
4
Many creative dishes to try. Char siu is a must-try! portions was too little for bigger group (>3-4) sharing though, perhaps should have options for bigger portions
5
This is my second visit there. The food are great. We ordered the their recommended dishes and it turn out great!
3
Food was Overrated, service was poor. Service staff did not seem happy to be working there to begin with. Atmosphere and ambience was not too bad. Service crew wasn't familiar with the entertainer and cheers app and it's promos...
5
Reasonably priced with portions enough for 6 persons. The moonlight truffle beef hor fun was delicious and the full slab ribs was well done! A yummy free crispy aromatic duck with pancakes was given free - to top off the whole Father's day celebration experience.
5
Interesting fusion of food, good variety too! Best part was the service, staff were extremely attentive to our needs and were prompt in serving the food. Would go back again!
4
Came here for dinner and tried the smoked duck Claypot rice- can do better with more black sauce. We also had a mee tai bak with fried century eggs that was quite good!
4
We ordered the moonlight beef Hor fun. I didn't realised there's truffle until my companion pointed it out. It's barely noticeable but overall the dish is good but not exceptional.
4
Food was good, and reasonably priced. Truffle beef horfun was tasty, I would recommend their bao too. 1 min walk from Holland V exit B, very convenient.
3
There was a trash bag in full view on the dining floor and I was afraid pests would be running about. The wooden chopsticks given was also dusty. The ingredients where they made the bao was placed under direct sunlight and the raw ingredients (carrots, meat) were not covered which made me afraid to try even though these were their signature. Food was flavourful but hefty pricing - a plate of fried rice costs $16 but you can get the equivalent in Michelin-starred din tai fung for less cost at a even better taste. We tried the vermicelli which is also $16 but it looked like a plate you can get from ananas cafe for only $2. The taste is flavorful but we were worried that it was from MSG and not natural flavours as there were no 'NO MSG' claims on the menu. The ambience is what we are paying for but the view of the thrash bag spoilt my appetite
4
We were here for lunch, overall experience with food, service and atmosphere was good. We were seated on the 2nd floor by the window so had good views of the street. We found the bun burgers average and wouldn't consider ordering it again. However the moonlight truffle beef hor fun and French beans with Sakura ebi were nice. Beef was tasty and French beans were fresh and addictive.
4
We felt like eating claypot rice but most famous stalls are at non aircon location, so we decided to try out the claypot rice at Full of Luck club. We ordered the chicken with salted fish and truffle beef claypot rice, both were delicious! The side dish (crispy duck and veg) weren't so good. Overall we enjoyed ourselves. Good service, they were attentive. They gave us fortune cookies for free too!
4
The dumplings in red chili oil was fantastic!
You should also try their XO carrot cake - we had it as nibbles in the Lucky Bar just upstairs. :)
4
Good food, quick service and full of surprises. Sure huat when you visit this place!
Love the fortune cookies!
4
The baos at this restaurant were extremely delicious especially the pork belly and honeycomb ice cream bao!
4
food was good, flavours weren't really unique, but the presentation was quite different, but it works.
1
From beginning to end the service was abysmal. The food was horrendous, I would avoid this place when there are so many other places to eat nearby. We have loved here for 5 years and I don't think I have eaten in a worse place.
5
Staff are all very friendly, but might be because the restaurant was pretty much empty when we went there. Food is good for it's price, but their fried rice is abit below standard and too dry. Will come back again to try other items on the menu in the near future
4
We decided to try out Full of Luck Club on our usual Girls' Night Out and we were not disappointed. The Moonlight Truffle Beef Hor Fun hit the spot. So did the Chicken and Salted Fish Claypot Rice. The Poached Spinach in Trio of Egg provided the veggie / soup elements. We had expected the Fried Squid with Salt and Pepper to look like Calamari rings but were delighted when a bowl of fried tentacles came to our table. Delish!We managed to squeeze in a Kung Pao Fried Chicken Bao and a Braised Pork Belly Bao to cap off the meal. While these two didn't hit the spot as much as the earlier dishes, we were glad to have ordered them.With the Entertainer 1-1 promo and the UOB credit card promo, this place has good food and prices that won't hurt your wallet.The air-conditioning (depending where your table is) might be a tad cold for some so it might be a good idea to come with a shawl or dressed for the cold
5
Food was great and so was the service. We enjoyed the truffle beef horfun the most , but the clay pot rice was a tad too dry. Light bites were especially delicious - the golden sand corn and the xo carrot cake were really yummy
4
Loved the ambience of the restaurant. Service was warm/friendly. Expected a little more from the food but overall was still good! The carrot cake was delicious!
4
Truffle beef hor fun not bad but couldn't taste much truffle, mee tai bak lack of taste. Could improve but customer service is good.
5
They have a really innovative and creative menu and place is good for group gatherings!
Love the idea of 'luck' as a theme for the restaurant (:
5
We popped by for a short meal and got 2 Hor funs to try - silver spoon fish Hor fun and moonlight truffle beef Hor fun. Both were equally yummy but I personally prefer the silver spoon Hor fun as it wasn't too saltish.
4
The place is nice, not too crowded at around 8pm plus for dinner. Food is good. Moonlight Hor Fun turns out really good! Should also try the bao for something different. Staff are friendly and gave good recommendations.
2
Servers made me felt that I was at a club/bar, didn't feel like a standard restaurant service. Ordered the beef horfun, the black pepper sauce overpowered the truffle scent completely! Not much thought went into designing that dish
4
Service was attentive and quite swift even at dinner peak hour. Prices are slightly on the high side especially for the buns, but the sizes of the mains are decent for a 2-3 to share. Recommend to get the crispy duck!
4
The menu was smaller than an average Chinese restaurant but there were lots of the usual family - style zichar favourites.The portions were good and 4 dishes were just enough for a family of 4.the dishes we enjoyed the most were the cereal soft shell crab ( good value for money as well) and the 3 cup chicken, both were tasty and satisfying. The Mapo Tofu in a cabbage bowl was an interesting twist but not that tasty, the worst dish was the truffle black pepper beef claypot rice.None of us could detect any truffle aroma at all and the amount of beef was miniscule. The rice was overly burnt instead of pleasantly charred and crispy.Service was fairly good but not so efficient
3
Not sure if the restaurant wasw crowded or simply understaffed... sequence of service was wrong. Asked for the vegetable to be served with the Claypot rice but dim sum was served with the rice instead. The vegetables came later. Did not clear the table before serving dessert
5
A funky modern Chinese restaurant. It is not just about the food, but the vibes, the surroundings and the dÃ©cor. Everything was good except that the KungPo Chicken Bun was a little overwhelming with the vinegar taste. We will be heading to that restaurant again this Mother's Day.
3
Liked the design and theme of the restaurant with the usage of pink. Food was nice but a little too expensive
4
One of the new F&B joints at Holland Village, I was curious and peered in a few times whenever I passed by. The decor and ambience are great, there is also a bar on the 2nd floor that's worth checking out. We ordered beef truffle Hor Fun, it's sgd20 which is slightly high on price, but we were not disappointed. The chicken wings are very tasty too. I also like the cereal soft shell crabs. The tast
4
Love the mini paos and the spinach beancurd, wished the portion for the food would be bigger though. Service is impeccable! Will go back to try more food.
4
Full of Luck Club had very interesting and innovative menu. The restaurant decor was great and comfortable.
5
This place is interesting to the tee
..please please check out the place..nice cocktails plus food to salivate
3
I extremely loved the creativity of the dishes especially the beef fried with maggi and also the Ma po tofu which was not extremely spicy yet had a kick to it and was really satisfying
4
The truffle beef claypot rice is great! Decent amount of dishes to choose from as well. Will visit again.
4
Interesting cantonese restaurant with a bar upstairs. Nice food. Must try their bao (bun). Especially like Kung Pao Fried Chicken Bao and Panko-crusted Portobello Bao
4
Really unique dining experience. Unfortunately, food was a tad salty. Service was impeccable as the staff would automatically refill our tea jug without us requesting
4
The first time I visited the restaurant was in February this year on the last day of Chinese New Year. They impressed me with their good food and impressive level of service. They set the bar so high that I had Great Expectations. The baos were consistently fresh and delicious. The truffle beef claypot was unique and fragrant. The service was faultless. Great Expectations came with Great Satisfaction. I give it
3
The food served was of a smaller portion and was slightly on a saltier side. However, the ambience and cocktail served at the rooftop bar was awesome. The only downside was that our cocktail took 30 mins to be served after we ordered
4
Truffle beef hor fun was very delicious, felt the truffle went well with hor fun!! Salted egg yolk salmon skin was great as well ~ XO Mee Tai Mak was mediocre though. Loved the ambience of the place as well!
5
Food isn't the cheapest but the service was great.
The bar is a nice place to hang out at, and the drinks were prepared very nicely.
The beef dishes were really yummy!
5
Very generous portions. Food was great and service was prompt. Will definitely come back to try the signature items.
5
Food is excellent and perfect for sharing, as portions are usually just right for about 3 pax per dish. Good, spacious atmosphere at the top level.
5
There is a big fortune cat in level 2. Environment and service are great. Suitable for gathering.
Recommended to go.
5
The restaurant is nicely decorated and the variety of the food is extensive. There will be something for everyone.The moonlight truffle beef hor fun is really good! The amount of truffle is not overpowering and the beef is tender (:The staff are also friendly and attentive
4
I reserved a particular table a week in advance but didn't get it. Staff were apologetic and the service recovery was unexpectedly good. We all enjoyed the food. Food that were authentic yet had a twist which delighted our palates. The only dish that was not to our liking was the Boss Chicken with Szechuan Peppercorn. It was not their fault, it was just an acquired taste especially the Szechuan Peppercorn. An affordable place for families. I'll be back with friends to
5
The food served at Full of Luck was awesome! One of the best chinese restaurant I have been to - the food has unique tastes. However, the pricing tends to be towards the higher end, around $20+ per person.
3
Order the cny set. Value was worth the money but food was very salty . will try their regular menu next tim

Visited in the afternoon on 27/1, it was not crowded at all on the first floor. As soon as I entered in, no one came to attend to me to sit to a table, after which the cashier came to attend and got me a seat (as I had made reservations). They did not give me a menu, I waited for quite awhile before they did, and after getting the menu, i raised my hand to place my order. No one attended to me and the staff that saw me told me in mandarin rudely, "Wait! There are people coming in." Eventually someone came along to take my orders but i was already very upset with the service provided. Eventually, when we raised our hand to get the bill, the staff said, "Here. Na!" and pointed to the cashier.We ordered the 2 pau for $9.90 and it was served in a very small serving portion and had no distinct taste to it. The chrysanthemum tea was nice and the sweet and sour soup good too. Overall, wouldn't go back. Staff service was terrible. Only beauty comes in its instagrammable menu and decor. Food was ok.

Prompt service and relatively quiet, great for gatherings. Chinese food with a twist. Recommended to try.

Ordered 4 different types of baos. The salted egg prawn one had no salted egg yolk taste at all and I felt that the other paus were ordinary. The only thing I really liked was the salted egg corn!!

FOLC tries to be a bit of everything: hip, traditional, family, casual. It does decently on every dimension, but you get the sense it could potentially be so much more if it focused. I would go with a smaller group of 3-5 as portions seem sized for that rather than larger families, and I did enjoy the noodle dishes, which were the most value for money.

The food is good, ambience is nice. Most of the staffs are nice except one who never smile and like we owe him money m..

Good addition to the numerous Holland Village eateries and brings something a little different in a couple of quite funky rooms upstairs and downstairs. I am aware some people have mentioned the small portions but, for my friend and I, this was perfect and just what we were after so that we could share a number of different things on the menu. We had the shrimp and scallops from the Dim Sum menu and whilst simple both were tasty. We sampled the smoked duck and the pork belly from the bao menu and both were very nice and also tried poached wantons in chili soy again, very good and the squid which was a little chewy.A bottomless tea pot was very welcome as was the efficient service and a very reasonable S$54 bill making it, in our view, at least, very good value for money.We'll be back

We ordered the duck confit bao, the salted egg yolk bao, the hoisin ribs and the fermented bean paste chicken wings. The baos were not served hot enough, the ribs were 2/3 bone and 1/3 meat! The chicken wings were ok but honestly we expected a lot more coming from Li Bai. Do not go there expecting Li Bai standards. Strangely though, prices were totally at Li Bai level. Please improve your ingredient quality and your attention to detail in serving out your food
