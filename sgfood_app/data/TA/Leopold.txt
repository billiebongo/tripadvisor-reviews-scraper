A bit over German beer of late, but the place is okay. Interesting selection of beers, namely from Austria. Not too pricey either.
5
Best place in town! Best bar ever! Love the wine bar. Ask owner Klaus Leopold about his recommendations, he will help you with the best selections of wines.
Food is very delicious and the service is very welcoming.

We had a dinner at Leopold. The place takes its roots in Austria and is good for after work drinks and tapas. The choice of dishes and wine is rather limited which limits its attractiveness for a comprehensive dinner. Service was careful but a bit more of enthusiasm would be appreciated.

Food was really great, unique in the singapore food scene for sure but staff could be friendlier and more cheerful :

You won’t go wrong with Wien - German food! ✨ This is a homey small restaurant owned by private, not a chain restaurant type. Food was yummy, its flammkuchen was really tasty, goulash was to die for, apfelstrudel was pretty and the best I ever tried in Singapore, very nice hospitality, friendly and helpful staff, positive vibe, good ambient, highly recommended!! Well, remember to make a reservation prior to your visit since it is a small restaurant and busy on weeekend

The attentiveness and enthusiasm of the service made for an enjoyable, evening. Great place to unwind. Definitely must try

I stumbled into this restaurant while trying to escape the rain, and found the place cozy and welcoming. A table was offered immediately. The beer was refreshing as was the Beef Goulash and the warm home baked bread. I was told that they had exhausted their pork dish
4
Nice place to chill out on a weekday night with friends. Dimly lit, but cosy for a small group. We couldn't decide which fries to order so we ordered both Cajun and truffle fries, they were both really really good! Also enjoyed the beer and ham/cheese platter, crispy duck leg and slowed braised pork collar. Yum
5
We had recently return back from our holiday in Europe and we were reminiscing the yummy food we ate in Austria so we thought of giving Leopold a try. The meatloaf sandwich and goulash tasted as good as the ones we had there . We'd definitely be back . Thank you so much
5
One of the less known bars in Singapore, I would love to keep as a secret.Great Austrian cold cut & cheese platter, fantastic wine and outstanding gin.It's a very cool place, but cosy. Great to watch people, or just hang out and chat with the owner
5
Really good Austrian wines + great meat and cheese platter.
Staff were polite, food was delicious and reservations were easy to make on Chope.
Will definitely be back.
5
Great people, ice cold beer, best coffee in town (Meinl) & great selection of wines.
Austrian fare at its best!
4
Nice ambient for chilling up. More crowd coming in after 8pm. Good food but portion are small . Great service and friendly staff. Must try the truffle fries .
5
Had a lovely quiet meal with a friend on a Sunday evening.We ordered the cheese and ham platter and some drinks to go with it. "Hugo" was quite delectable and refreshing.We were attended to by Mr. Leopold himself, who was warm and accommodating; especially when my friend wanted to order a second glass of wine slightly past happy hour time slot, and was still charged the happy hour price.Would definitely go back again to try the authentic Austrian food there
5
The food,service and ambiance are great. May have to wait awhile for your orders to be taken during peak hours during to shortage of manpower.
5
If you are around ChinaTown in Singapore and want a great drink and friendly staff,come here.I haven't been to a bar , or club that has made me feel like I am in my own place.Good music , not too loud.Come here
5
We stumbled upon after a half day of strolling through the malls and trying to find a good bar before we left SG! We really glad to have found Leopold, odd enough though it is located a few metres away from our hotel (Amara tanjong pagar) and we spent a few hours there before flying back to Amsterdam for a great German beer and proper wine, we felt like home, and it was certainly a great ending to our holiday. Great selection of affordable beverages, such a bummer that we didn't have enough time to try the food but no doubt it is delicious as well. Great service, we met wonderful expats living in SG and not to mention friendly owner. Period! nothing else to add :) having drinks here is like being in Europe. A must visit when you are in Singapore. Definitely recommended!
3
Food portions were small but it was a quiet place that gave us a good place to meet and chill as a large group
5
Leopold is a very good location too relax and to have a good glas of wine or beer. We loved to stay here for 3 hours. We had one bottle of the best austrian wine. Very good place to be. Very clean and we loved the service
5
Modest menu compared to most restuarants.The platter is great value for money. Love the cheese and bread! Everyone I brought here enjoyed the food
4
Loved the cheese platter, Ordered pork collar and beef goulash, prefer the pork collar and the sauerkraut seems to be tailored to the local taste.
4
Just walking along Tanjong Pagar road when we spotted this bar which seemed quite busy so we gave it a try. Lovely Austrian Tapas and and great beers. Nice atmosphere so much so we visited twice.
5
Gathering with bunch of friends for dinner~ it's awesome! Great foods, from starters to desserts!! Definitely will be back & would recommend it to all my friends/families.. Danke~

Austrian friends who are also Survival Chic Members had recommended this chill new gastrobar, so I headed over with a couple of friends to check it out, not quite sure what to expect. The 36-month air dried iberico bellota was scrumptious, and we also enjoyed the yummy mini schnitzel, the cheese platter, and the original ‘duck leg with its cranberry jam’. The atmosphere was chill and quite hip, and it struck me as a great place for a casual night out with colleagues or even a low-key date, since prices are very reasonable. We decided to choose an Austrian white wine that I didn’t know beforehand but thoroughly enjoyed. The Owner, Klaus, was friendly and apparently has a strong background in mixology - so we plan to check out the cocktails next time for sure
4
Small place on the roadside of tanjong pagar area. First time coming here cos of entertainer but im already thinking of coming back. Good music,good ambience,food is really good and service though two man gastro pub is good too. Good for beer meet up,meal and chill

Was just walking around aimlessly in Tanjong Pagar on a Sunday evening a few weeks ago looking for a watering hole.Passed by and well I decided to walk further and it seems that everywhere is closed on a Sunday. So I decided to give it a go.What attracted me to this lovely cosy wine bar was the music.Rock music from the 60's to present day was being played. Which is a very rare find in Singapore to be honest.Music from the likes of Led Zeppelin,Black Sabbath,Deep Purple,Queen and etc from the 70'sGuns N Roses,Skid Row,Whitesnake,Motley Crue and etc from the 80'sNirvana,Pearl Jam,Stone Temple Pilot,Alice In Chains,Faith No More and etc from the 90s...A little indie from time to time like The Cure,The Stone Roses,The Smiths,Joy Divison.On top of that service was awesome and friendly. I must say,I am impressed.Decided to have a chat with the person in charge for the day. Azmi.He told me that the music was playing that evening is not an everyday affair. It's only on Sundays.Monday- Saturday is more loungy music,ambience music...So I asked why rock on Sundays and not hip-hop or pop?Well Azmi says he loves his rock music and he thinks that rock music in bars,pubs and restaurants are a very rare find in Singapore. Plus he grew up listening to them.I must say that Azmi knows his music! I literally spent hours just chatting with him about music the entire evening. This guy really knows his stuff and I must say I am impressed.Although I did not have the food but I must say that service and other aspects of place was awesome. Azmi and D(waitress) never left me dry. My beers were always delivered on time even before I finished my current one.All in all I must say this is a must go to place if u want to listen to some old skool decent rock music. I am sure I know where to be when I come back the next time in a couple of months.Make sure you go have a chat with Azmi about music. You will be impressed! KUDOS TO LEOPOLD

First time to have authentic Austrian food in Singapore. The food is great, just like in Austria and they serve quality wines and spirits from Austria and a great selection of bottled and draught beers. Prices for food and drinks are reasonable. We enjoyed the personalised service. We had a lovely evening and will definitely come back
5
leopold did not fail to deliver great Austrian tapas. Tapas they serve here are straight forward without being pretentious. The beef goulash are cooked to perfection. It come along with a kaiser bread roll for dipping. Being a cheese lover, the cheese spaetzle pasta is a personal favorite. Service staff are friendly and attentive. They even have a vast selection of wine for take away..Highly recommended gastrobar for all occasion

We decided to visit on a weekday night, hosting a friend from overseas after learning about this unique Austrian restaurant on the Entertainer App (I wouldn't have known about this place otherwise!) Starters we had mashed potatoes with bread - good. Mains was Chicken Stew (rice was wet and soft); Duck Leg (good and tender) and Pork Collar (soft and some parts dry). Food was overall enjoyable, and the whole experience could have been better if the service was slightly more prompt and smiley. (I am not sure if it is due to the fact that we were using the entertainer app to apply for a free dish of the lowest value
5
Stumbled across this place in amongst Korean restaurants. Absolutely fantastic food and service. Started with the duck legs to share, which were amazing but just not enough for two, followed with a mixed platter for one which was also fantastic with the different cheeses and meats etc, service was great and friendly. Highly recommend
5
If you are a fan of quality German beer, Austrian wine and cured meats then this place ticks the boxes. Fair value for money, personable and attentive owner and staff add to the experience. Highly recommended for a relaxed, quality night out.
5
Excellent and authentic Austrian tapas selection! The staff especially the owner very nice, quick and attentive service.
A place to go for something different...

Went there once for one for the road. Became regular guest quite fast and going there now couple of times per week. Good stuff. Good food. Good host surrounded by good people. Well done. See you soon!

My partner and I visited last night for dinner and i found out about this place from the Entertainer App that i got. The App allowed me to redeem anything from the menu for free as long as it is the lowest price one, so the app paid for my salad which cost $8. The food is a hit and miss. the $8 salad, honestly only had rockets and some dressing, i am very sure it is something i will not order again. Another recommended, which is the Chicken stew was an absolute disappointment. It reminded us of the Airplane food we had onboard Emirates, it was nothing fantastic. The beef goulash and the apricot dumpling were the only ones that i thought was well worth the money. We had beer and wine for our dinner and they were pretty good. Infact, i realise the people who were there, had drinks only. I doubt this place is known for its Austrian Tapas. We had a seat inside, but it was pretty warm, we left once we finish our food. Service was average as there was only 1 server and it could get a bit busy although the place is small. Plenty of good eateries around Tanjong Pagar area, i don't think i will be back again for their food

we had an early dinner at Leopold on a Sunday. Ordered their house red wine which was nice and came in a suitable wine glass. We tried quite a few items on the food menu - chicken drumlets which were juicy and spiced well, cold potato spread and meat loaf and a pork collar dish. Everything was cooked well and we liked the minimalistic plating too
4
We decided to come here after seeing the ostensibly reasonable wine prices on the website. Unfortunately we failed to realise that these prices were only applicable for wine purchased for consumption elsewhere. Wine for drinking in the bar costs about an extra $30 a bottle. Accordingly we decided to stick to beer (also not that cheap, but good). We had a selection of snacks to go with the beers: all very tasty. Good atmosphere and friendly staff. Worth a visit
5
Leopold is a great Gastrobar that deliveries in all ways! Great selection of Austrian wines (the owner is from Austria & passionate about wines, you should chat with him to get his advise),great bar snacks & daily specials! A place to hangout with friends for some drinks, having delightful Austrian tapas and other daily specials - or to celebrate any kind of party (private of cooperate). Any day, anytime! Oah Stiegl bitte!Ps: they do retail on Austrian wines to very good prices... Just got myself a few bottles for Christmas!
5
I stopped by at Leopold after work to have some food and drinks. Besides the typical must haves from Austria like a platter with speck and cheese or schnitzel the menu looked like 'I want to have it all'. Also the imported beers and wines are available for very reasonable price when you compare it to other places around Singapore. I ordered the special of the day - Austrian Beef Roulade - which Klaus the owner an chef of the place created. Perfect! Azmi and Aqram the friendly staff looked after the guests this evening and kept everyone satisfied. Absolutely worth a stop as it is also very convenient located just minutes away from Chinatown and Tanjong Pagar MRT station. Check out the Vinothek and bring some wines home
5
I found this place on a walk through Tanjong Pagar and had to enter when I saw the wine selection.We stayed there for dinner and I have to recommend the beef goulash, pork collar and meat loaf roll!The tapas portions a good to try the whole menu for a very good value!I came back a few times also for afterwork drinks!The owner finds always time for a fast chat. Particularly Azmir takes care that your glass is never empty - great service!Ps: Don't forget to check out the wineshop and enjoy these awesome Austrian wines at home

We popped into Leopold after wandering around the Duxton Hill area one evening - it's a funky, eclectic part of Singapore not far from Chinatown, with loads of restaurants and bars. We met the owner, a friendly guy from Austria who speaks perfect English, and he made us very welcome, recommending the Hirta beer for me (which was excellent). We shared a bowl of mozzarella with tomatoes and pesto - perfect tapas style food after our big lunch earlier in the day, and everything's reasonably priced
5
Love their cheese and meat platters. Great night out with friends. Intimate, not too loud or crowded but still enough activity so it's not boring.
4
My boyfriend loves Leopold when we walked over here, so we decided on here. We called the drinks to sit and watch the scenery around here. Coffee here quite tasty.
5
went back after long time.new Austrian tapas on the menu.service and quality of the isstill the same or even better.
well done MR. Leopold...we will be back soon.
5
Nice location, excellent food, perfect service. A loverly place to spend a great and easygoing evening.
4
Klaus does a great job of making Leopold work. He is nimble, attentive, professional and a competent short order cook. While O Batignolles battles, Leopold achieves euro-cool ease effortlessly. This bar is worthy of your custom
5
Got to love this place. Great drinks, good food. Nice staff. Will return for more. You have to try the fabulous Austrian wines and beers on offer.
4
Went to Singapore on a lone trip and decided to try Leopold out for the last night i was there. I got a wonderful cheese platter with some black olives and german beer to accompany me and they did not disappoint. The server (can't recalL his name, sorry ) was very attentive to my needs which i truly appreciate. Would definitely come here again the next time i am down.
5
Just by accident I found this small restaurant in Chinatown when a friend visited me from Europe and wenn want to have a drink before dinner. As it was such a cosy atmospere we forgot about the dinner and staid until the end at about 3am.Klaus the owner was hosting us like long term friends and gave us a good feeling.The food is unusual but tasty and the right thing together with some beers or of a glass of Austrian wine
5
...well, i cant really follow the last there reviews... Firstly, I believe if you want to go in a restaurant then do not go in a gastro pub... thats European bistro style and has nothing to do with a restaurant that Asians usually expect.I have been several times there and I cant complain for food neither for service. The could cut platter... is always good. People may say thats nothing special but if you would know Singapore then you already know that the quality is much better then most of the competitors offer...Service is always done with charm and if the owner has time to have a chat with you surely he will do so. It is a kind of home away from home for those who love this kind of style...Again, for those who expect a restaurant then please go into a restaurant.. there are enough Korean places around or even a Chicken up...eat there if you think it is better! I prefer personal service and a charming ambiance rather than a typical Asian food stall atmosphere restaurant!Cheers!!!

We went to see what the fuss was about and the answer was not much. It's an ok bar with normal range of drinks and very limited food. In fact some of those options were not even available (mozarella sticks). Service was very prompt and efficient. We sat inside and space was very limited with little space for bar staff to get by tables. Air con inside was not very good and we all got warm very fast
2
Disappointed to discover only a short list of snacks and pizzas on the menu.
The restaurant is mainly to get drinks with friends.
4
Good quality cold cuts and cheese. Elegant atmosphere. Popular with both locals and foreigners. Slow service.
5
European food and beverage with variations you may enjoy! Friendly staff with a competent, qualified and smart owner!
5
Most welcoming place in town with great prices, good quality food & drinks!
Try the Austrian & German Beers, as well the typical traditional "Fleischkässemmel"!
5
One of my favorite chill out bar!! Great beer & Pizzas!! Be sure to look for Mr klaus!! Good looking chap who runs the place! Great hospitality!
5
Best kept secret in Singapore
Awesome Austrian wine & beer as well Paulaner draft beer
I will be back
My only comment is awesome
Don't miss it

I only dropped in to have a few beers and a light supper whilst I caught up on the day's emails but I was very pleasantly surprised. A mixed plate of cheese and meat was excellent - not least because the soft cheeses were actually soft and not rock hard out of the fridge. Ample supply of both with some fresh warm bread. A few large weissbiers to wash it down and I was well happy. Happy to recommend to all
5
I am amazed how one man can take orders, cook and serve the food and still deliver! Nice interiors, perfect music!! Food was awesome, didn't have to wait so long. Service was great! Didn't get the chance to take the cocktails though so I have a reason to be back. :
5
Serious looking and hardly see a smile is always a sign of bad service. But not at leopold. Despite his serious looking face, his service was fast and polite, product knowledge was good and basically handle a crowded place calmly and swiftly. Walking to and fro, in and out like a professional. Thumbs up to him on making my first visit a great one. Will be back for more. Great food, wine and service. Finally manage to get him to smile before leaving and havinga quick chat
5
We were in Singapore for five days. And the best food experience we made was in the Leopold restaurant. It is a very nice place to eat and drink typical european dishes for a good price. We enjoyed the beautiful ambience and the owner is very friendly.I would recommend the Leopold restaurant to everybody who wants to have a nice diner or just want to drink something.
