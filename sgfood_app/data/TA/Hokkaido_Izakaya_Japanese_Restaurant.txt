We ordered 2 main dishes (the wagyu dish was more like normal beef) but the size was of an appetizer! And the price was definitely like a main course. After having paid 90$ for 2 small dishes and 2 beers we left… still hungry.

Thought this was a good solid meal. Nothing particularly outstanding, but all dishes very tasty. The kakiage soba was the dish for me.

Located around the other great restaurants in the Tanjong Pagar area, really lovely place for lunch if you work in the area or dinner if you live around. Delicious food and prompt service.

As a sibbling of the Tanjong Pagar Hokkaido Izakaya, this operation had a great start.More recently, there seems to be a distinct cut in the quality of ingredients, especially the meats used. It’s a shame, as we do like this brand, and want to come back..

Hidden gem in a sea of Japanese restaurants along Orchard Road. Salmon Belly Set for SGD18++. Every bite just gets better && is a step closer to food heaven!I found this hidden gem as I was passing by Wisma Atria's new Japan town at Level 4. It's not exactly new but I haven't had the chance to drop by since it opened in 2017. There were so many options to choose from - especially ramen - but this place caught my eye because they were offering a lot of differen

If this restaurant was ‘a one night stand’ you’re guaranteed a fun night with no regrets. We chanced upon this place for a quick dinner and weren’t disappointed. The vibe is very casual and unpretentious and we were greeted with a warm welcome. The atmosphere makes you want to have a cold beer and enjoy some tasty snacks so we got stuck in. We tried the deep fried wagyu beef steak, which wasn’t the most amazing we have experienced but it was pretty good, soft tender meat with a crispy coating of breadcrumbs. We also had a medium sashimi platter which was surprisingly fresh and pretty good quality comprising of tuna, white bait, salmon, fish roe and another assorted fish. The croquettes we tried were a little different from others I’ve tried as they were ball shaped rather than flat, but the filling was creamier and filled with tasty potato pieces. We also had a plate of karage fried chicken, which for 6 dollars was a generous and tasty portion. We helped our meal along with a bottle of sake which we had hot. The service throughout was attentive and efficient, despite us changing our sake order around 5 times. The atmosphere was fun and relaxed (a lot of Japanese patrons having highballs, always a good sign of authenticity), and the food good. The price was a little above average, but in our opinion, well worth it for the experience and a good night out

Didn’t notice this place for quite some time until a friend invited us here. Food quality and service are very good. Nice ambience, perfect for after work get-together. You got to try the ff:- edamame as appetizer - grilled squid - agedashi tofu- salmon salad- scallopsThey’re also popular for oysters. But we didn’t order any. I wish to come back here.

Got into an argument with the waiter when he informed me that the chef does not allow me to share my food with my wife.Nowhere is it stated that there's no sharing allowed. They only changed their tune when I told them to cancel my order and that we will never come back. waiter then threw our food on the table.Now I know why the place is only half full during peak period on Friday night.Please do us all a favour and close down

Went with my friend to have the buffet dinner at Wisma Atria. The restaurant was packed with diners. We were told that the buffet was for 1.5 hours only. Food were served very fast. Our table was meant for 2 people so it was quite small. We asked the staff to serve in batches due to space constraint. However staff continued to serve food despite the obvious. The ala carte dishes were supposed to be prepared as ordered. Some dishes, however, were already cold. Fried items such as chicken karage and potato croquette were not crispy. It was a let down that business was done in such a way.

No doubt that the food is pretty good, but I would not recommend anyone to visit. In our recent visit, our dinner was affected by a roach that land on one of friends.I am appalled by the way that their staff handled this at the end of our meal. They told us that the roach incident happens often, brushing it off like it is not a big deal, and they don't seem genuinely apologetic about it at all

For this price, I expected a Japanese level of service but I didn't get it. Pity.
This place offers nothing like a Japanese Izaka experience, not even sure why it is called Izakaya.....

The food was awesome and the sashimi was very fresh . Very different tastes as compare to others. The Japanese guy service was great and very attentive. Only disadvantage is not enough seating.

To try in the area! We took the sashimi that was very fresh and the grilled saury fish is excellent.

We visited this restaurant in a group and ordered lots of food. The food was fantastic and we liked all the dishes we ordered. While we were having a good time over delicious food and fun conversation, a cockroach appeared out of nowhere at our table. I lost my appetite after that happening. We were so loud when that happened and I'm sure many customers and staff around us noticed what was happening, but the staff we complained to at the time of checkout said they don't know anything about it (many people including the restaurant staff saw it!!!), and treated the event like it's common and no big deal. Are you serious? I was so disappointed and believe they should have handled this situation better

I have been dining at this place on a regular basis. Their food quality has been consistently good. However, their recent Wagyu beef promotion was a total disappointment to a point that I felt cheated. We ordered the 250g Wagyu Sirloin steak that cost $120. It was so bad that we had to ask what grade the beef was. We were not expecting an A grade, perhaps B grade but to our horror it was an F1 grade. At least a quarter of the beef were stringy and could not be chewed. Definitely not worth the price. Better go to Meidi-ya at Liang court and buy an A grade beef and cook yourself. To me, this experience has compromise the integrity of the restaurant. This outlet was at Wisma Atria. Next time, for the price you are paying, best to ask the grade before ordering

Was there with an ex-colleague. We were impressed with their friendly service. Add to the fact that the chef and wait staff are Japanese, ooh la la! Casual ambience, good for catching up with old friends. Quality of food was good and they have additional soft-boiled eggs for toppings at no additional charge! Pure bliss

We had the omakase party set and there was so much to eat, and with such good quality, we probably fell into a food coma. Service was friendly and polite and food was definitely plentiful and fun to eat. Wagyu was amazing and seafood was fresh. Casual and unpretentious. Love it

Had the milk hotpot, milk omelette, potato salad and milk ice cream, totaling around $50 for 2. The food was really nice, perhaps due to the ingredients mostly from hokkaido. The food is very different from others and service is great. There is limited seating, so probably try to avoid the peak eating hours.Overall, I would say its value for money for the excellent food. Located near many other japanese eateries, I would say this is worth a try
