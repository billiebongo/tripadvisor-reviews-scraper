Very tasty bowl of ramen, had a sashimi as starter which was also very good. And the beer was very cold and tasty. I left the place very happy.

Three main ramens made on pork broth. You can choose between spicy and originl broth. I was surprised how good it was. Try also the gyoza and the BBQ pork.

Haven't tried their ramen, but various sashimis and the beef stake are amazing. I used to come here regularly during my 5 week stay in Singapore.

Marutama is among my top three lunch places in Singapore. (they are open for dinner too, it's just that I usually go there for lunch) I'm a big ramen fan, and have tried many in Singapore. So far, I like Marutama the best! What makes their ramen so delicious is the soup, they use chicken broth. Make sure you try the ramen with everything. I prefer the spicy version of it with an extra egg. You can never go wrong with extra egg. Portions are very generous, so usually you will feel full after a bowl of ramen, but if you're with friends, order some gyoza to share, it's very good. Although ramen here is the best, other stuff on the menu are great too, we tried oyakodon and the beef and it was definitely worth it. For drinks, go with honey lemon or tea.The reason why I prefer to come here for lunch is because most good places in Singapore are full during lunchtime and you have to line up, but it doesn't happen in Marutama, I never booked in advance and never had to wait for a table. It's also good if you're eating alone, you won't be the only one.The service is fast and relatively friendly. Yes, it can feel a bit rushed around closing time, but oh well. The place is clean and it feels cozy. The location is convenient, just a few minutes walking distance from Orchard Central. All in all, I'd say you get a pretty good quality/price deal here, so make sure you drop by.

If you read through the reviews about this place, you'll find that most agree that the food is great but sometimes the service leaves much to be desired. I frequent this place regularly and the first few times, I did get irritated by the rather curt service especially around closing time. However, once you get used to it, you will learn to just accept that and enjoy the food. The food is five stars but the service is the reason why the restaurant is only four stars in my book.The ramen is excellent and arguably the best in Singapore. It is not as famous as a few other chains but in my humble opinion, it is much more delicious.Location - Very conveniently located in the heart of the city. Walking distance from the Somerset MRT station. Service - Friendly most of the time, but rather curt when it's time for them to close up and go home. Food - Excellent. Ramen is great. The texture of the noodles is perfect and the soup is very tasty. If you're into spicy food, do try the spicy version. The soup is good till the last drop. If you're not into ramen, I tried the oyako-don before as well, and it's good too.Atmosphere - No frills. Lots of japanese books and magazines on the shelves if you're bored.Wait time - Non-existent most of the time. Very brisk service and hardly need to wait for tables except during peak times. Even then, it's not crazy with queues like at some other famous ramen places.Recommendations - Try the spicy version of the ramen with everything added

Never heard or seen this restaurant. Was just walking around to check what restaurant to dine since we were waiting for our que from the iphone x launch.We decided to try this place and never figured it was a ramen place. We just ordered what we wanted to eat that night. And it did not disappoint. To the point that we came back the next day for lunch.It was that good

If I were a business owner, I would think very carefully about continuing to employ those who give my business a bad name. Very bad first and last experience at Marutama, I would expect such treatment from a bochap kopitiam owner and not a seemingly famous ramen place!You be the judge (note that I try to be as objective as possible and many things that I really want to say have not been written to keep it short and concise):-We arrived at around 7.45pm and obviously the order took time to come. 1. At 8.45, our plates were taken from under us (without first being asked) and we had to insist that my friend's plate not be removed (mine was removed as I was in shock that my plate was lifted off the table before I was asked if I was done)2. Shortly after, the bill was sent to us without us requesting for it, and the staff stood there till we paid because "last order at 9.15pm"3. At 9.05pm (they were listed as closing at 10pm), we were asked to leave because "they were closing", even when just moments earlier accepted new orders from another table 4. Of all the customers there, we were the only ones to be chased outWow. Just wow. What a first impression.

The decor appeals to solo diners, with loads of Japanese books. Most who come seem to be regulars and solo Japanese who work here. I had fried mine pork, Very generous portions. My salad leaves were too tired so I didn;t like those. My companions had steak and pan fried fish and those were fine!Coffee jelly was a tad bitter even with vanilla ice cream. Match ice cream was fine

I only recommended Marutama Ramen on Killiney Road. Here is the restaurant that I feel like home when I arrived. very good Service. Sashimi salad with fresh raw salmon and others fresh vegetables was a very good combination. btw, This branch is open for dining only

I visited this ramen restaurant a couple times. I like it because they use chicken base soup. Most Ramen restaurants in Brisbane use pork bone soup which is too oily for me. I ordered their specialty chicken ramen with egg. The portion was generous and egg was very yummy and soup was addictive. The staff is friendly and very the place is clean. Highly recommended
