Same as any other kentucky fried chicken outlet. it is a fast food joint - what more can you expect? however this branch is not opened 24hrs!

I am totally amazed by one of the employee there with the name of Alex,He is old in age but very young in his working spirit. Fast and efficient and customer service skill is well, i would say tip top. Never I've been amazed by other KFC employee before, but thanks to Alex, I've seen a bright side on KFC's customer service now
