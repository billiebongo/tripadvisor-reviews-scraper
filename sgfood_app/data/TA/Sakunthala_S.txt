Casual dining with local clientel. Do try the tandoori chicken which was top notch but only two measly pieces. The prati and dosa with condiments were OK enough. Service does not excell but nor disappoint as their laid back style exemplifies this place.

nice south indian style non veg restaurant in Little India. Reasonable pricing. Very crowded in the evenings & weekends.

Food was yummy and the staff was kind and helpful. Clean and pleasant place to eat Indian food. They offer home delivery too

Our first outing in little india was a delight. Food was outstanding and the service was attentive.
I had the mutton and my wife the chicken crepe. All very good.
5
The food is amazing, super helpful staff ans so cheap. The atmosphere is so alive with energy and smells of great Indian food.
5
Excellent food and service. The waiters were attentive and even gave recommendations on what dishes to select. My husband was unwell and they recommended a crab rasam for him to feel better. Really appreciated their concern.

We were looking for an Indian restaurant and we found several through TA that were expensive or whatever. We wanted something authentic and where the locals go. We were told of Sakunthala so, we planned our subway rides to find this place. As soon as we got to the area, we knew this was going to be authentic as it was very much off the beaten path on a side street. We got our table and looked around watching the locals eating with their right hand without silverware. ....they leave their left hand down on their laps. I ordered tandoori chicken biryani which was quite good and my partner had lamb biryani. He used silverware but, I decided to try it the local way and use my fingers. Trying to pick up rice wasn't easy but, I noticed the locals used the sauces to make the rice stick together so...with some patience and luck, I was able to make it work.The food was quite good and very reasonable. I think we got out of there with only about a US $20 charge. Nothing to write home about but, well worth the experience. I would go back

Had lunch with two Indian friends today at this restaurant. It was my first visit and when one of them who is a frequent guest suggested that we order the Fish Head Curry, I was a little skeptical. I love my fish head curry, and though I can't claim to be an expert on this dish, I have eaten enough over the years to know a good or a mediocre one. So, I was very surprised when they served the dish on the boil with lady's fingers and other vegetables. The meat was fresh and the curry not too rough. Sometimes, the masala that some restaurants use can be have a little bite. This curry was mild but still had a good taste. I immediately thought that this would be a good place to bring foreign friends who had never eaten fish head curry before, as this is a taste that they could handle. For those of us who are accustomed to a sharp taste, this curry would be tasty as well. So, I am now a convert and can add Sakunthala"s as another go to place for fish head curry. The next visit, got to try the other dishes they offer. Looking at the other diners eating with relish, I don't think I am going to be disappointed

Walking around in Little India during Deepavala, looking kashmiri naan only, found this place which not only had excellend kashmiri naan, but the butter chicken was great and the fresh pineapple juice and lassi, as well. The sever, Megla (?) was so great and kind, easy to talk to and friendly.We so much enjoyed this place
4
Food is yummy and affordable. Baby/Child friendly as well. Staff were attentive and friendly. We were a group of 15 pax and they managed to get our orders right. We tried different items on the menu such as briyani, egg thosai, plain thosai, venpongal, mutton, lamb, chicken, fish and they were all delicious
5
Fourth visit. Had chicken dum briyani it's good as ever. The rice was fluffy & the gravy was spicy and delicious.
5
We got a chicken biriani, chicken 65 and a another dish which name escapes me (it was incredible though!). Just good good Indian food served on banana leaves. Highly recommend if you are looking for a good Indian restaurant!
5
I have been through many dosas in little India and I find this one exceptional 5 stars..... Also the rest of the food is good and yummy
5
We ordered the Mutton and Fish meal sets, Mango Lasi's and Chapatti. Everything was excellent. As I was beginning to run out of rice our server came by and scooped more on my plate for me.

Great food which my friends look forward to. Yesterday I was there between 7.30pm till 8.30pm. Enjoyed the plain thosáº¡i, Bru coffee and payasam with my cousin. As I was paying the bill of $10.20, I gave 2 red Sing notes to the chap at the cash counter as I did not have the exact amount or another two dollar note besides my reds. I was given 80 cents change. When I asked for the remaining change since I had given $20, the guy claimed that there was only one red note in his till. When I insisted that I had given two red notes, both of us locked horns. I then suggested that we look into the close circuit camera, he said that I could come back another day. When I suggested I see the manager, he said that he was the manager. Finally the matter was resolved when he reluctantly returned the correct change with a sour face. He probably was disappointed that he could not pull it off. Good food but opportunistic behaviour towards the unsuspecting customer

I was the happiest person after a meal here. Firstly, the service was prompt and the servers so courteous, there starts a good experience. I strongly recommend the ghee dosa and the pepper mutton here, down it with a glass of chilled lime juice. You wont have an ounce of regret. Pricing is slightly on the higher side, but for what you get and how good it all tastes, its alright. Its fine. I'd suggest you visit during the daytime, so that you are able to walk the meal off. So close to the Little India MRT, it's easily accessible as well

Not all great meals have to cost you a fortune. And if you are in mood for some Indian fare, Sakunthala's is the place to be.Usually crowded during peak hours, the place is packed to the hilt. Service is super quick and ambiance is just about functional. But you are here only because of one thing...and that is the food. Both the vegetarian as well as the non vegetarian variety is great. And tastes awesome too
3
Love the food Here, full of spices everywhere !Spicy and savoury!You got to try their briyani's and lassiAbit over priced but what you expect nowadays?can go there once a while unless you are rich thn frequently !Place is clean but always crowded so have to wait sometimes to be seated.Overall it's a nice place

Good shop near mustafa, after spending hours in their this place is quite near. Visited it after lunch hours late noon. Tried masala thosai and prata set. The quantity is quite huge and food was good. One can pay a visit.Food - 3/5Ambience - 3/5Service - 2/5Overall - 3/
5
You know you've found a good restaurant when the locals are queuing outside the door. Had a feat with drinks for $30. Not your average Indian and k suspect not going to appeal to all palettes as not tailored for western tastes but we loved it. Friendly staff and definitely the place to go if you want to try traditional Indian food. As you can see, there wasn't much keft. The meal sets are great value at $6-8
4
After India and the great Indian food we really wanted to get some more...
Sakunthala's was a place we enjoyed. The nan, the chicken tiki masala, the masala chai..... And it was nice to see everyone just enjoying their food.
5
Heart of Little India, serves Halal, quick service but wide menu choices. Vegetarian and meat dishes. Good casual dining.
3
We stopped here for a short pit stop. Drinks only, but good choice and great service. Excellent location and ideal for people watching!

Nothing exceptional with this Indian restaurant serving typical indian food. Was looking for the speciality of the house but nothing .. I am used to Indian food maybe. The bryani is quite spicy - beware for kids !
4
The food tasted great. Most staff looked serious but there was one who took care of my family very well. The restaurant also opens till late too so you can eat at any time! Very recommended!

My first experience on authentic Indian food, and so far so good! We visited the sakuntala's restaurant near mustafa center, on syed alwi road, it's located on royal India hotel's first floor. Although the place look like fast food restaurant, always crowded, the floor was quite dirty, but we can bare with it. Our friends recommend for their breads, so we ordered only naan & paper tosai. Our order was garlic naan, butter naan, plain paper tosai (came with 3 different sauces), butter chicken curry (our favorite! Yummy & melted on mouth), fish curry (also taste great). The only let down was, the paper tosai didn't came out hot & crunchy, it was already cold. We complained, but they didn't handle it well & not change it. This place open almost 24 hours, morning utill 2 am, so it's a great place to go when you're hungry at midnight. Afterall, the other food taste great, and I had blast on Indian food. Tips is you have to eat bread with your hand, dipped it in sauce & go enjoy it. Bring your own wet-tissue to wipe hands to avoid going on their washroom, I heard it was filthy. Another tips is, go here before/after the usual lunch/dinner time to get a place to sit & avoid the overly crowded crowds.
4
Food is average we had "rawa thosai"and "plain thosai" for dinner with iced lemon tea.It was very crowded,waiters just walk past you as if they are busy,nobody has any eye contact with you at all.Whole place is filthy with food crumbs on the floor,table is wiped with the same old dirty rag,looks like all the eateries never teach the waiters to clean the floors and rinse the rags to wipe the table.Tables are grimy and stained,we never returned to this place after our fist visit.Wash area is really filthy
5
This is my second time I have been this place staff are very nice and very good food with huge quantity I always left some of pack. This time I went with my wife she also loved crab curry me also like indian thali veg I but I couldn't eat all of them items because it was a lot for me. Different lind of dishes price is very reasonable most if if indian visit this shop because food and price
5
We where wondering the streets of Little India and we found this place full of locals. We went in and sat straight down a couple of minutes to order and 5 minutes to be served. Staff where very helpful with the menu & gave us a fork and spoon as we were the only non locals in the shop. The food was great& the service was great.....
5
I ate there first time in 2007 after trying several indian restaurants in Little India. These days it was much more basic and very less frequented by tourists. Every time I am in Singapore I use to eat there and until now I have never been disappointed. I love the Mango Lassi, the Curries, the Masala Chicken and especially the Masala Dhosai and the Kotthu Parotta! I never had them as delicious as at Sakunthalas, anywhere! This is why I always return and as you recognize many Indians do either..
5
I chose this restaurant as it seemd popular with the locals. The service is outstanding - the staff will make recommendations for you and the food is wonderufl - easily the best Indian food that I've ever had.
4
What you pay is what you get. It's not bad for the price, but don't expect much decorum. We came in for a quick lunch, it was tasty.
1
I ordered thru delivery online on 14/06/2015. I ordered 3 naans, 2 keema, 1 mutton chop & 1 masala thosai. Total amount is about S$50. The delivery came on time. The food was cold. The naan is very thin which looked like an instant one. Much much better to buy from neighbourhood hawker centre. The gravy was spilled out of the food container. It looked messy and not presentable. I was shocked with the food condition and the amount of money that we had spent. On the tv commercial stated by the actor "Tak belum angs". Now i understood well the meaning
3
This restaurant is located in the heart of Little India area, near the Mustafa Center. There are mostly Indian cuisine options and some other Asian dishes. The quality of the food is great, and the cleanliness is nice. I recommend it if you are passing by and like Indian food

Little India is indeed an attraction in sterile and soulless Singapore, there one can find a few Indian restaurants, but Sakunthala's has really grabbed my attention and I don't regret it!First impression isn't a good one, of a true eatery in a mining company or a steel factory - please overcome that prejudice and walk in, food is cheap and most tasty!Don't come around midday, you won't find a table or would have eventually to share one, which is also fine. Fresh water is served at no cost and shared with everyone at the table.Choose one of the set dishes, they are served on a tray covered by a banana leave - most people eat with their hands, kids just love it! Mix up all sauces with the rice, which is refilled any time at no extra cost - and watch the tacky Bollywood movies playing around!For such a dull and blank place like Singapore, this restaurant is a breath of senses of all kinds, give it a try!

Sakunthala'S was recommended to us by the (Indian) hotel staff as the best restaurant around, so our expectations were pretty high - looks like Komala Villas (where we have eaten several times previously) set the bar too high - for us the food didn't even come close to that served in KV. It was packed with Indians - only 1 table of tourists except us - which is almost always a good measure of quality (I would never go to a restaurant which has more than 30-40% of tourists, unless recommended/taken there by locals). Still, we didn't like the food as much as in Komala Villas
5
Most Indian restaurants outside India are horrible. But this time I was the luckiest guy in town. I was passing by Sakunthala's in Singapores Little India. The card outside struck me, since it had some very special Indian delicacies. Inside it was crowded with Indian people, so I got interested.Well, I was not disappointed. The card was great, but the food served was excellent.Not tourist-Indian, but real Indian, of high quality. Very nice polite and helpful service. And the bill? No issue perfect value for money

We went to the Syed Alwi Road branch for lunch. We had a mutton briyani, 2 pratas, a chicken masala and some dhal.The briyani was very average and it was NOT DUM briyani as the mutton masala was added then covered with rice. The rice was just passable lacking the flavour of good briyanis and the mutton was tough as leather.... I can get much better at Tekka market for half the price (of course the env there is pretty basic) The dhal (US$3) was just water with very few dhal - very dissappointing.The chicken masala was red in colour and just tasted of super spicy chilli without much other flavour. The prata was good though, very fluffy and nice. So, overall, this place fails on the food qualify front. Perhaps their thosai and idly are OK because that is what the Indians ordered..... it wasn't expensive but not worth it given the quality of food
5
U cant leave singapore without trying to eat here! Spicy as in super spicy... Haha.. But the best and sooooooo delicious! Cheese naan, mutton meal set and the prawn masala is the best! 3 straight years of visiting sg and i never failed not to eat here... Then visit mustafa after.. 24hrs shopping center... Yeah! Enjoy ur sakunthala experience coz i definitely did! See u next year..

We usually eat at Khans Restaurant across the road and we were bullied into this place by the staff that stand out the front. We were happy with the food and the service was okay, but we still think across the road is better flavor and service, and cheaper by far. This place is able to cater for breads which Khan don't do. If I want naan's I would probably choose a different restaurant though.
4
Been to their Syed Alwi Road branchnear Mustafas.
Their mutton fried rice is simply superb. Fantastically done with pepper mutton. A must try dish...
Just love it...

We had dinner here. We had typical north indian punjabi cuisine. Good and tasty preparations, good ambiance, acceptably clean and reasonable charges. Quantity of biryani was too much when we packed it to carry it to our hotel.
5
Throughout my 7 weeks travelling throug Asia this is one of the best indian meals i had, especially the best mango lassi ever (and believe me, I ate a lot of indian food during this timeperiod ;))it is a very authentic restaurant, busy, not too touristy, loud and the restaurant itself is not very fancy. however if I was in Singapore right now I would not wanna miss go eating there again
1
Ordered 1 pcs of rava with onion n chilli and puree set. The rava came tasted not that crispy,on top of that ,the coconut chuttney was cold and watery + the chilliy chuttney was very watery and taste less. my wife ate the puree set and turned out oily n there was no chick peas in the puree curry..overall i well never eat in this place again.i will stick to my regular at KAMALA's,below the block after tekka market.
5
Going authentic Indian? Not flash?Thinking that I might try a Thosai as a starter, and then the chicken curry set was not that smart. There was so much food and I got topped up with more dahl with Thosai. Couldn't finish it all.Really tasty food, very busy, full of locals - I was the only westerner in the place (good sign of the real deal!)Great eat place and cultural immersio
5
I've been to this restaurant few times. The food here tastes really good. My favourite is the Kotthu Parotta(chopped rotti). I must say that the kotthu parotta in this restaurant is the most tastiest I've had outside of Sri Lanka. Its in a very busy location. lots of people traffic and sometimes you have to wait few mins to be seated. The quality and taste are fantastic. The staff are very friendly as well. Their biriyani is very tasty as well. Overall a very good restaurant to have some wonderful meals. The pricing is a bit expensive in Singapore, compared to some of the other cities I've been to. If you are in little india, don't hesitate to visit this restaurant. I'll surely be back here just for the Kotthu parotta next time I'm in S'pore. I think this restaurant is 24 hours. Very good restaurant in a busy location with some quality delicious meals
5
Sakunthala'S was recommended to us. It is located in little India in Singapore, there is nothing fancy about this restaurant but it serves good, honest food. No tablecloths, no plates to eat off - food arrived d on trays with pandanus leaves on them and the food set on the leaves and you just ate from the trays. Food was tasty and very fresh and cost was cheap - compared to Perth prices. Provided you're looking for tasty Indian food and not a five star restaurant, it worth seeking this place out. Would definitely go back again next time I'm in Singapore

Sakunthala'S is set on Dunlop Street in Singapore's Little India. It's a great area in which to roam, people watch, and shop. We broke away from those activities for dinner at Sakunthala'S. The restaurant was busy with customers even at an early hour for dinner. We tried their mutton biryani and chicken biryani, three different types of vegetables, two chappati, and a mango lassi. Everything was delicious. Service was friendly and attentive. Well worth the stop on Valentine's Day
3
It's a mid-range Indian restaurant in the heart of Little India! The food is Halal which is great and the service was good but I didn't like the food at all, I am not an expert in Indian food but I believe the chicken I had was tasteless
4
Hi guys recently i visited Singapore for office work, i was in 5 star hotel but i am unable to eat the food you wont find any Indian food items, so next day with one of my friend told me go Sakunthala restaurant, wow what a food really suprb, unlimited biryani papada, all north and south indian food items. The cost of the food expensive if u compare with india but if compare with othe hotels in singapore its very less.and i was 1 week every day i eat food in Sakunthala only
