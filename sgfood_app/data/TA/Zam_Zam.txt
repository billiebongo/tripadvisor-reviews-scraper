It is a great way to start your day. We ate downstairs with plenty of locals. Service was good, the price was fair and we had a great time.

Everyone needs to experience this place at least once. Try their murtabak daging/chicken/mutton and also their briyani.
4
Came here for early breakfast. We had the mutton murtabak, roti kosong and fried noodles. Food and drinks were delicious and cheap and came out fast. Must drop by if you happen to be in the area.

Busy,frenetic place,not for a romantic meal. Enjoyed our chicken murtabak,biryani and the side dishes with icy lime juice to wash it down.Got seated immediately and the order and food arrived efficiently despite the chaos of the place. Liked it better than the Turkish restaurants around the corner in front of the mosqu

Very large portion if ate alone although order the smallest. Better spare it with friend.Chicken briyani was delicious and also milo dinosaur. Murtabak is ok, but the pie crust or what is it called is a bit thick and kinda elastic.Very crowded restaurant.Spent less than 20 sgd for two people with 2 meals (chicken briyani n mutton murtabak) and drink (ice tea n milo dinosaur)worth to tr

Many of my friends and colleagues recommended this place and the reputation is well deserved. I ordered the chicken murtabak which was the best murtabak I have ever had, it was amazing. The portion was huge, excellent value (medium $8) and incredibly tasty. I sat outside so I got to eat with a view of the Sultan Mosque.

.........I was shokedI believe another review.But!!!!!Reviews are fallseOff course Everybody has different tastes.But but but but but!!!!!!!!!!!This restaurant service was worst.And taste was soso.(Well begun is half done.)Because of there Worst service I couldn't even start to assess the taste

Their reputation precedes them and this restaurant is famous for its values. My friend took me for dinner and I had an incredible meal. The restaurant was packed across 2/3 floors and we did share a table with some others but the food came very fast, the bill was very reasonable and it was my first time having deer - and it was excellent.It was so good, I went back the next day for takeaway and enjoyed it too. The biryani was great as was the Murtabak! I am craving it as I speak..

I am not a big fan of Indian food Nor seek out Indian food. It is too heavy and oily. So when you have to load those calories, it better be worthwhile. As a local, I have heard of Zam Zam but never visited it. Was in the vicinity and my schoolmate suggested visiting Zam Zam for a late lunch. We shared a chicken murtabak.....it is the best ever murtabak I ever tasted. Crispy skin wrapped with onions & chicken pieces. Soooooo goood! The Teh Halia (ginger milk tea) is just as awesome !

the location is strategically positioned near tourist attraction of masjid sultan. they have upper level for more dining space. service was good. we ordered chicken murtabak and chicken biryani. they're delicious and taste differently from what we usually had in KL. the rice a little bit spicy, maybe they use different spice. and the murtabak was yummy especially the crust so crispy. must try
5
First time there with our boys and all loved it!! Beef or mutton murtabak not spicy while chicken is hence it allows for different spicy level. We will be back again!
5
Tried the Lamb Biryani and the Chicken Biryani, both amazing and mouthwatering. A little bit expensive for its area and place however the food pays it off.
Should Try!
4
I'm not usually one for spicy dishes, but the food here is delicious and worth the slight tingling my generally plain palette is used to! Lovely service to! Worth trying if you fancy some affordable Indian cuisine!
4
We opted to try a local style food for our last night in Singapore and it did not disappoint! We wolfed down the mutton briyani and murtabak that we ordered a second round. Of course, we should probably have waited a few more minutes before our hunger crazed stomach over ordered yet again. We actually ordered the mee goreng and it was decent. The highlight though was the biryani and murtabak. Next time, just one order please

This is well known by Singapore locals and is the best establishment to experience Murtabak. This Indian Halal restaurant must have it working for them because they have been in operation since 1908. Located on the corner Northbridge Rd and Muscat Rd opposite the beautiful Sultan Mosque. The food is sensational and the two meals that we enjoyed on our last trip to Singapore included both chicken and beef Murtabak and Nasi Goreng.  Murtabak is best described as a stuffed pancake that is cooked on a hot steel plate served with a spicy sauce. Watching the creation come to life is almost as exciting as eating one. The cooks are not shy and with  little encouragement usually in the form of filming on your phone they will add a little flamboyance in the preparation. If possible sit on the street side tables and take in the full Zam Zam experience. The  "Hello Zam Zam sir" and "Zam Zam Alcazam" chants of the the waiters drumming up business out front adds to the traditional feel of this restaurant. Drive through, drive by crazy Singapore street styled take away service is also something to see. Cars with Zam Zam VIP windscreen stickers line up blocking the lane to pick up pre ordered meals. Frenzied calls over two way radios give the passer by the idea that it may be a little illegal. But hey its Singapore, just pay the fine and go again. Also check the call to prayer times for the Mosque, the beautiful call adds even more to the great atmosphere.

Zam Zam used to be our favorite eatery for its delicious dishes, reasonable price and friendly service. However, our recent visit on 17 January 2018 was very disappointing, the waiter who took our order has a very indifferent attitude. We also noticed price for many items on the menu were simply covered and we got the answer when bill came: price for certain items have increased tremendously, e.g.: Teh increased from $1.2 to $2 with much more diluted taste in order to further cut corner. Portions have also decreased by 1 third to half compared our previous visit in Dec 2017, barely any vegetable in curry fish head. We are convinced we should stop going to Zam Zam again
3
Many praises and good reviews given to this restaurant...Management and staff should upkeep this standard of good quality / healthy food and customer services rather than to be too complacence. Try the mutton biryani very salty without enough pickle cucumber, pineapple etc and the bee hoon goreng very soggy and it was served on paper plate. The forks and spoons not properly wash we found some rice there ( Very unhygenic ) Its really very poor service restaurant ..
4
Heard that this place sells the best murtabak in Singapore and so decided to check out this restaurant in the Kampong Glam area.A few things to note if you were to visit Zam Zam:- Avoid usual lunch timing (1130am to 130pm/2pm) on FRIDAYS as they are super short-handed then due to their muslim prayers- They do not serve prata during lunch/dinner (i.e. peak periods)- If you were to buy your food to go (i.e. order takeaway), it will most probably be ready much faster compared to you dining inWe ordered the briyani and the murtabak; food was delicious! But to call it the best murtabak, I can't really tell cos I'm not really a big murtabak fan to start with. The briyani was very tasty though! Teh tarik was normal so nothing special there. One compliment I would like to make is that even though the waiters took some time to come to us to take our orders, the food did arrive pretty quickly so that was a pleasant surprise
4
We saw this restaurant while waiting at the signal to cross the road and decided to go. The thought of yummy, spicy and flavorful food drove us there and we were not disappointed! We ordered Mutton Curry with rice and Chicken Murtabak. Chicken Murtabak is mildly spiced but very flavorful. Its their most popular dish. It is naan/crepe filled with egg and chicken curry. The mutton curry blew us away. So flavorful and one of the best we have had
4
Located near Haji Lane, ZamZam is a simple cafe with indoor and outdoor seating. It's always busy with diners enjoying their speciality: murtabak. This is a kind of thin crepe with different fillings such as chicken, mutton and even vegetarian. These are all freshly cooked to order. It's pleasantly spicy and a single murtabak is plenty for one (although they are so tasty, you might want another!). You can also get some rice dishes and an assortment of cold drinks. Very good value for money
5
Found this place just off Arab St recommended by Lonely Planet. Great prices. Had the mutton murtabak, very filling & delicious
5
We loved Zam Zam, especially the Murtabak. A real experience with great staff and beautiful food at incredibly low prices. Highly recommended.
1
Went for my usual morning prata, encountered a horrible service from the one staff, worst thing is boss also don’t care even after complaining..
4
Lunch with my friend. Foods very delicious. Air con room at second floor. Must order Nasi Beryani with tandoori chicken. I will come back again.
4
Murtabak is the item to order whenever you are here. Briyani is the thing to order. Between the chicken and beef, go for the beef if you can.
4
Love their murtabak as always, especially chicken murtabak
Somewhat maintain its standard over the years although the prices creeped up slightly (which is fine)
5
This is a established local restaurant.It is ideally located near Haji lane and Arab street and serves as a good base to explore the area.The food is tasty, the staff helpful and friendly. It is always very busy - it is fun to see the restaurant operates and adds to its appeal
4
I like this place very much and decided to take my Son their for lunch. I thing it’s had a makeover since my last visit as the room we were in seemed fresher than how I remember it.The food is very good and well worth the money. We had mutton murtabak. Mutton biryanis and chicken masala all washed down with lime juice.I highly recommend this restaurant
5
Get the murtarbak and enjoy the best food decision you’ve made in Singapore. My husband shared one with chicken and fought over the last piece. It’s a must try - all the articles are right. It’s a flaky and crispy outside packed with moist flavorful chewy delicious ... I’m getting hungry!

We went to Zam Zam because of the good reviews. In front of the restaurant it says it's the best Muslim food in town. While I don't know if there is any better restaurant, I can't imagine that this is supposed to be the best.If you're taking a seat upstairs, don't expect a greeting, a menu or anything that explains your meal or it's price. The stickers on the walls mostly have no price or they covered the old one up with duct tape. The price the waiter charges Und for something might be different than what you saw on the laminated card that they throw at you when you take a seat (the beverages on the back side a price to them, which turned out to be not right) While I got my not mediocre chicken murtabak a minute after I ordered it - too quick for a fresh meal - my friend got his food after 20 minutes when I was already done with my food for a long time. His chicken nasi goreng was cold when it was wordlessly thrown at our table and didn't taste like anything much. As a woman, I didn't expect much of a conversation with the waiters but being frowned upon isn't my understanding of Muslim hospitality. I'm from a Muslim family myself and I work in the service industry, so I am not overreacting, but the treatment of their guests was straight up rude.We wouldn't go here again and I certainly didn't leave this place with a smile
3
The place looks a bit dodgy, but the food is very tasty. So if you are in a hurry and you want to fill your belly I recommend it.
5
The best murtabak in the world.I like chicken murtabak,But they had meat and mutton too.The service also fast.
5
No doubt about this restaurant, the most delicious biryani and murtabak you’ll find here. Best price! Best taste! Don’t forget to try ice bandung and also teh tarik! It’s a pleasure to spend and fuel up your stomach here!
5
This place was recommended by a Singapore native as “the place she takes her grandmother”. It didn’t disappoint. It’s busy and chaotic but worth the hassle. Go upstairs for aircon. Wave down a waiter, don’t worry about the table buttons, they don’t seem to work. The food came quickly and tasted amazing! It cost about $15 for two, including drinks. Take a walk around the streets surrounding Zam Zam...there’s lots to see in the neighbourhood.

STAY AWAY. Save your stomach for better food and service- service was the POOREST I've ever experienced. Every single staff member would brush off our requests. We asked for another menu to look at which never came, we were not given napkins but with a quick glance around it appeared other guests did (not sure if it's because we were foreigners?) and we asked to cancel our drinks because they didn't come out even by the time we finished eating- we gave them a friendly reminder that they hadn't. When we asked to cancel them, they brought them out, placed them on our table and walked off. Not an apology nor a word spoken! They never responded to our requests and walked away to speak to each other. Absolutely a waste of money- food tasted awful too. I honestly can't fathom the wealth of positive reviews about this place.Don't risk your time and money on the disaster of a restaurant. We left feeling infuriated with their service and that our money went down the drain!
4
Came here for breakfast one morning with a relative and was impressed. The menu wasn't huge, but the quality of the food was good. Service was prompt and the staff were very personable. Portion sizes were decent and tasty and the gravy provided was pretty good as well.Only beef was with trying to find parking nearby. But if you can get here via public transport (about 5-10 minutes from the MRT depending on how fast you walk), it's definitely a goo place to get some halal food
3
Was told by a friend that they have the best mutton murtabak in whole Singapore, so we went to give it a try. Ordered a $10 mutton murtabak: impressive size, served pipping hot, crispy prata - however not sure if there were two layers of eggs or just one and without the curry sauce, the murtabak itself was pretty tasteless. A good experience, and since this was the first time we ever ate a mutton murtabak, we couldn't really judge if it's the best. But won't mind to come back if we feel like eating a mutton murtabak
4
Went to the famous Singapore Zam Zam in Kampong Glam area (in front of Sultan Mosque). I went here because i read on someone's blog post that said this is the must visit restaurant if you were exploring Kampong Glam/Arab Street/Haji Lane area.Came to this restaurant at 10.30am and still closed so we decided to go to Haji Lane first while waiting it opened. Back at 11.25am still hasn't open yet, but some people already waited the restaurant to be opened. Finally, it opens at 11.30am and we were asked to go upstairs.Ordered Mutton Briyani and Deer Martabak. But it wasn't our time yet to taste Deer (not available), so then we chose chicken martabak.No wonder people recommend this place. Because all food is good with big portion. The mutton is very tender and the rice is tasty.For the martabak, it's a bit different with martabak in Jakarta, because i think they pour a curry to the chicken and put it into martabak skin
5
Came here due to the reviews on the Murtabaks and they didn’t disappoint. Delicious, great value & the air conditioned room on the 2nd floor good escape from the Singapore humidity. Cash only & like a number of restraints in Arab St area no alcohol offered
4
Would certainly recommend this spot for simple flavourful food. Sure, it comes on plastic plates and the setting is far from fancy but boy does it taste good. The chicken portion atop the biryani was a bit tricky to cut with a spoon and fork but was worth the effort and the mutton Mysore packed a punch. Two good sized portions and two drinks set us back just short of £10, extremely good value
4
Go for the murtabak
The halia coffee / coffee with ginger is also nice
The size of meals is pretty large, so for guzzlers like me, it's nice
4
A must visit restaurant in Singapore for the best chicken and mutton murtabak served with curry sauce. the restaurant is nothing flash, but the food is - and great value.
5
Very close to the famous mosque in singapore. A must visit restaurant if you are here. The briyani is very authentic
5
Place was almost full but waiters was really fast and kind.
I have to recommend that murtabak that they serve at zam zam, was really tasty and cheap too!
5
Not much to say, it's just cheap and delicious, come and grab some foods for breakfast or lunch or dinner!!
3
Our first bite to eat in Singapore. We both had chicken biryani which was good. Could hv had a wee bit more chicken but very tasty.
4
This is a must for lovers of curry and spicy Asian food. Its in the Arab area and surrounded by lots of interesting shops and other food outlets. Note please those who like a beer with their meal (like me) this is a muslim establishment so no alcohol is sold there. But don't let this put you off visiting ZAM ZAM as the asian spicy food experience is second to none that I know of anywhere in Asia. My favourite foods their are lamb biryani, lamb curry and murtabak. Zam Zam is not to b missed
4
This restaurant serves one of the most famous beriyani chicken in singapore.A must visit place for food lovers. If you are not into rice, they serve also famous singapore murtabak which you can choose from variety of choices such as chicken, beef and even deer.And most importantly, the price is right and not too expensive.A must try eatery
4
In a really nice part of Singapore and easy to find, Zam Zam is a great way to start your day. We ate downstairs with plenty of locals and while it is hot and somewhat disheveled, this only added to the experience. We shared a medium chicken murtabak that was soooo tasty and filling and seafood mee goreng that just didn’t float my boat (flavour was bit too strong for me). Service was good, the price was fair and we had a great time
5
Zam Zam is well know for it’s mutton Biryani or the locals would call it “Biryani Dam”, an aromatic fragrant rice cooked with mutton gravy served during Muslim’s wedding day or on any other special occasion. I would say one of the best Biryani to try if you’re in Singapore for a short visit. The place is easy to find and even taxi drivers would know the restaurant’s name if you direct them to Arab Street and The Sultan Mosque. Or take the MRT train and drop at the Bugis station and make a 5 minutes walk to Arab Street. Although the restaurant is nothing compared to a five star restaurant decor, but the food is. Apart from the mutton Biryani, you also have a choice of meat like chicken and prawn. The best seller would be the Martabak, a dough mixed with all sorts of spices and mutton or a choice of chicken or beef, which is fried crispy outside but tender in the inside. I just loved the mutton Martabak and it’s best eaten with the thick curry gravy. Patrons will have a choice to eat the Martabak with cucumber and tomato sauce or the dhal. The Martabak comes in sizes from small to a large serving but the fillings are all the same. If you do a takeaway, the Martabak will be wrapped with a banana leaf, before a second paper wrapper make the final wrap.The yellow noodle (Mama Mee Goreng) is also a dish to try while your stomach can take in. Garnished either with beef or mutton and lots of spices all mixed together with egg topping, this dish can also make you drool all over. Order the tea (Teh Tarik) to quench your thirst after indulging the food. Its specially filtered with tea hash imported from South Asia. Extremely aromatic but a bit sweet though. Although this restaurant is great for meat lovers, vegetarian menu are included as well.The roti prata served in plain flour or with egg is great especially for breakfast time. It’s matching gravy would be the fish head curry. Simply irresistible! Will definitely come back for more
5
I’ve been going here for 30 years. Never disappoints. Amazing food and a real taste of old Singapore.
3
Had dinner here a week ago, and enjoyed the casual craziness of the place. The beef murtabak was very good and huge. The mutton biryani was OK, but just that. Good value, but better food if you head over to Little India.
4
Went there for early bfast as they open at 7am..murtabak and prata are good - value for money definitely!!
3
Visited this place during deepavali. On second Floor an Airconditioned space. Very busy with a lot of locals. Food is good but a bit dirty. Don’t use the toilet because you have to go through the kitchen.
5
There are lots of Indian Muslim restaurants in Malaysia but very few can offer better food than Zam Zam.We went there by train. We stop at Bugis Station and walk to the restaurant for about 200 metres. We sat at the air conditioned area on the 2nd floor. We ordered large chicken murtabak, chicken briyani, mutton Briyani and fried noodle. The fried noodle was a bit disappointing but the briyani and murtabak were very delicious. The portion was quite big but we finished it anyway.The murtabak is available at different size with the price ranges between $5 and $15 and Briyani will cost you about $6.50. Overall i found it affordable and very tasty
4
After having read about Zam Zam in a few travel blogs, I was delighted I gave it a try.I love chicken murtabak and the one at Zam Zam did not disappoint! Maybe a bit pricier than others I had in the area but worth the extra cost. The place seemed very popular with locals and tourists alike
5
It’s located near Masjid Sultan. My friends and I were looking for a cheap restaurant for lunch. Their murtabak is amazing. They have different size with different price. We ordered medium chicken murtabak. It was quite big. Enough to share with 3 people. Their fried mee was not very good though. The medium murtabak is $8, teh ice $1.50, fried mee $
5
When approaching the restaurant we were offered seating upstairs (where the AC is - yes, please!) and took two empty seats. Shortly thereafter our orders were taken - mutton biryani and a chicken murtabak because of the reviews on TA. The biryani and drinks were served only a few minutes later and then the murtabak. I had never even heard of murtabak before but we were not disappointed! It tastes kinda like a puff pastry lasagna and I will dream sweet dreams about it. The biryani was good and a little spicy but ultimately nothing special according to me though the husband loved it. The server will come around with the bill and when you’re done you pay at the cashier downstairs. At S$17 we will be back several times before going home
5
Lordy this place is good. Noisy, efficient, clean, great service, cheap, authentic. When you've been in business over 100 years you know you're doing something right. Authentic Malay/Indian halal. Packed all day every day.....small tables curb side, downstairs near the register and kitchen, and upstairs in an aircon dining area (no view) for a $2.00 surcharge,. Must be well known - the two Japanese girls next to me who spoke no English were able to produce a small Sing. guide booklet with pics of the restaurant and the staff and recommended dishes. They were thrilled when the server brought the guy in one of the pictures over to their table. God knows how much take away these people do - the packaged curry sauces are produced by the hundreds. The place is known for its Murtabak. And, boy, is it good. Other dishes on display downstairs - check first as the only pic of a vegetable is bitter melon (which I can't stand) but other vegetable dishes may be available
5
Brought my Welsh relatives here as they had a craving for Indian. We ordered the beef and chicken briyani, chicken korma, fish curry, mee goreng and a medium chicken murtabak.Let's just say it upfront the chicken murtabak was the star of the evening. It is a flatbread stuffed with chicken meat, onions and other herbs and spices served with curry. A small one would feed a grown adult. It was served piping hot and portions of it were still crispy. Highly recommend. 9/10Briyani was alright, the beef was tender and the chicken well seasoned. Not too greasy. Not overly spiced or curried to death. 7/10Fish curry. Very well done. Fish was a snapper and we were served the tail portion. Curry was a bit watery but served with aubergine, okra and curry leaf. Fish was done just right, not overcooked, not under done. 7.5/10Chicken korma. Can do better. Korma was heavy and too oily. Greasy. Chicken was under seasoned. Not worth your calories and not worth your money. 4/10Mee goreng. Disappointment. Way below par considering the other dishes the mee goreng shared the table with. Noodles could have been al dente but were soggy instead. Not enough fresh vegetables and definitely not enough protein. Mee goreng needs to have a good texture and be served with fresh ingredients. This was a soggy mess. 3.5/10Interesting drinks the traveler should try: Bandung - a rose and milk drink, teh halia - ginger tea.Service was good despite the restaurant being packed to the rafters. Upstairs is air-conditioned. Not a great place for conversation because of poor acoustics
4
Some of the best food we had in Singapore. The staff were very friendly & the service was quick. Was amazung watching people just stop in their cars fir a pick-up service
3
The food was ok and pretty good value. However the service was poor. Hard to get someone to seat you, didn't clean up the table, difficult to get you order taken. Once you have managed to order though it's fairly quick. Average at best.
5
Great spot where you can enjoy of an exquisite murtabak, biryani, vegetarian and halal food! Great service and it's amazing to see customers pass by and while you're seated in such a gem! And the cooks making the delicious bread!
5
This was our first meal in Singapore. This place was on my must eat list based on TripAdvisor reviews. Murtabak was very good.
5
Went there for lunch, sat upstairs in the aircon. Has Beef Biryani, chicken mee goreng and murabek chicken. Food was excellent, Service great!!! Price was good value.Will definitely be going back!
5
Came here by chance thanks to TripAdvisor yummm the chicken murtabak is a work of art. One of the best meals of my life. Was so tasty and the curry sauce on the side just topped it off. Had mee goreng on the side also that was very nice. Cheap as meal for 2 was 17 singapore dollars ans both had a lemon drink whi ch was very refreshing
4
The last time I came here was years back. During one of the long weekend we decided to go down to Singapore. The first thought for lunch was this place. Which I frequent during my school days. The place still loos the same except for the extended area upstairs. It maintained it's charm and looks well kept. Located on North Bridge Road right opposite the masjid. Luckily we arrived just after the lunch crowd. So no problem of getting a table for 6. We ordered their famous nasi biryani kambing (mutton) and ayam (chicken). The former was quite spicy. My son didn't like it very much. The chicken was I feel better. All in all, it was quite a nostalgia for me coming back here. Oh, another thing that's good here is their mutabak. If you want to feel that old world charm in Singapore, try this place
5
Was recommended by a local to try their "pizza" murtabak here. It was tasty but I don't think there was cheese in it. I would come here again and try other items. It's been around for a long time and was very busy with locals, the prices were very affordable
5
Nasi Briyani and martabak is AMUST here because that is their speciality. 1 of the best nasi briyani I ever had. Martabak as well, such a WOW factor. We've been served by Abg Dollah, he is such a nice, friendly and very helpfull staff in this restaurant, always assist us. Service is quick. The best meal and AMUST when you in Singapore
4
I love the mutton murtabak and mutton nasi biryani. The murtabak is crispy on the outside and not too wet in the centre which I like. Mutton nasi biryani is the best that I had in Singapore, the mutton is soft, not tough and like the favour of the gravy from the mutton added to the basmati rice
4
They have 2nd floor eating place which more convenient. Order place directly to the attendance. Try the 6$ Briyani and 8$ Murtabak, it is good and comes in the big portion.
4
Wide range of food , you will be spoilt for choices.
Good service and they serve promptly.
Their Nasi Biryani, Murtabak, Roti Prata are the must try dishes. They are of good quality and cooked with their utmost effort and of course with their heart.
4
Chicken is good, but curry is very spicy. Didn't have chance to try their prate because it is not served during lunch time. Overall good experience
4
Been going to this place since I was small. Great place to have murtabak and Briyani rice. Murtabak is still the same even after 25 years.. great place to try local Singapore food
5
I probably wouldn't have come here if it wasn't for a friend taking me. The place is super busy and it's easy to see why! I had the beef mee goreng noodles and they were to die for! So much so I went back the next day and had it again! The best bit about it was the beef - it just melted in my mouth! As well as this, service is very good and the whole place seems pretty clean. There's air con upstairs too which is nice and the best bit about it is that the meal was only $7 (Singapore dollars) which is significantly cheaper than some of the other places I've been to in Singapore
5
If you are craving for Briyani - go nowhere else but here. You can even just eat the Briyani rice solo. You will find the normal add-ons such as the dhal curry and your other favourite dish like chicken, beef, mutton, prawn and not forgetting the pickles
5
The French may call something famous when it is high quality, not just tabloid. While many have mentioned that Zam Zam is famous, it should be acknowledged that the martabak at Zam Zam is quality, but certainly not known outside of Singapore. I mean, where did you first hear about Zam Zam? The french may say the martabak is famous. And other fame can only be provincially stated: this is simply some good roti
5
Our first meal in Singapore was at Zam Zam. While it looks small from the outside, we were taken upstairs where there is plenty of seating and even AC. We made sure to try the murtabak and also the biryani. Both were very good. The prices are very reasonable but be aware that they do not accept credit cards
4
This is an eating joint in operation for more than a century. They serve halal food. In the morning, you can enjoy their roti prata which is not available after the afternoon lunch time. The place remains open quite late until 11 pm. The main items on the menu are 7 different types of Biryani, Murtabak which is a stuffed bread with non-veg item (either chicken, lamb, beef, deer, or Sardine fish). They use authentic long grain Basmati rice for Biryani & is provided with a side curry & colored salad. Other items on the menu are various goreng items, chops, steaks, fish head curry & over 20 hot & cold colorful beverages.This place is located in historic Kampong Glam area on the North bridge road at the junction of Arab street. Nearest MRT station is Bugis with less than 10-minute walk. Other nearby landmarks are Raffles hospital & Village hotel (previously called Golden Landmark hotel). Exactly on the opposite is located Masjid Sultan which will complete 200 years by 2024 & is a national monument with distinct golden dome.It is a shop house with ground & upper floor seating arrangement. If you are not covering the entire table expect others to share nearby seats. Service & customer turnover is fast. Before or after the visit do enjoy various traditional shops on the Arab street

Zam Zam is a local restaurant, popular with locals and tourists alike. And of course, being popular, it can get crowded at times. Solution? Pick your times. It amazes me the number of people who go to a popular eating place and then complain that it's crowded . . . back to Zam Zam . . . there is a very wide selection of food, and it is very, very good, hence the popularity of the place with locals. The fact it is reasonably priced helps too.I've read some complaints about the perceived cleanliness of Zam Zam: sometimes I think folk confuse "disorder" or "untidiness" with "cleanliness". Zam Zam is a tad disordered, it is a tad untidy in appearance, but it is not unclean--we have visited on many occasions and even our sometimes fussy children have never commented about a lack of cleanliness.So, if you like Indian / Malay food, delicious Indian / Malay food I should add, and don't demand or expect Michelin-star furniture or waiters waiting on you hand and foot, Zam Zam should definitely be on your agenda in Singapore. We can't imagine a trip to Singapore without at least one visit
5
Colleague took me to lunch. Evidently famous locally. Had a crepe with beef, eggs and onion. Curry sauce on the side. Delicious. Cheap.
5
Excellent restaurant, good service, nice food, cheap.....what I can say more. Always full of indian people. Chicken Matubarak delicious.
Not to be missed.
4
Everything was good; the taste, price, service. Except that they did not have a seat for me. However takeaway was available. It is interesting that they sell all kind of food from Indian to Malaysian.

Biryani is far better than many shops in little India, but most I love is murtabak which is very different and heavily stuffed compared to other Malay shops.
4
Review by Dr Sim. Pretty good Briyani. Ambience is basic. I usually drive next to shop and buy back to eat. Service is quite good. There is always a few waiters next to the road hustling to sell take-away briyani. Regards Dr Sim

This place is well know for Indian muslim food and of course it's really nice I love it so much especially Beef Murtabak Nasi goreng with chicken. affordable price. However, it's always too crowded and it is really hard to get staff to order food and serve us
4
Cheap and cheerful meal in great central location. Across the road from Haji lane and Arab street overlooking the mosque. Ordered chicken & mutton murtabak to share, good portion size, freshly made and delicious. Personally I prefer the chicken over the mutton (too much onion for my liking). It was very busy at lunch time... with tourists, expats and locals lining up for tables. Service is quick & efficient (staff can be a little gruff but you don't come here for the ambiance/service). I plan to go back to try the biryani.
1
I went with my family hoping for a decent meal as i was following the good reviews, but i was shock, very dirty restaurant and awful service, crowded maybe because its cheap, not a really good food, i couldn't order anything for my children and i had to go out to look for other restaurant to find something my children can eat. I really hated the environment
3
Was looking forward to coming here as read such great reviews. It was ok! Considering this place is always super busy, I really do think they can renovate it abit and cleanse it up! Not the cleanest at the moment which is off putting. Food was tasty but nothing to rave about.Worth a visit if your not to bothered about cleanliness
5
On the recommendation of Mark Weins @migrationology.com we went and throughly enjoyed the experience. We had a small chicken Murtabak and a curry with rice. Topped off with the Teh Terik. A delightfully Singaporean experience th at was surprisingly cheap, fast and delicious. We also got to watch the Murtabak being made through the downstairs window.
5
Singapore kitchen for a very good price. I loved the boneless chicken and felt that it was an authentic spot. There were a lot of people and it was quite noisy but no problem for us.
4
The unassuming surroundings belie the quality and value for money of their signature dish - Murtabak.
If I was in Singapore longer I'd definitely go back.
5
The staff were very nice, food was amazing . You should go there earlier because many local people there too in lunch time . Very easy to find here . I had a good time there .i would like to go there again .
4
Brought my colleagues (28 of us) for some light snacks/drinks on 27 July. Ordered drinks like teh Tarik, Kopi tarik, Teh halia etc (Price from $1.20 to $1.50) and their popular Prata etcStaff is friendly and fast in taking orders. They even assigned an area for us to be seated together.Good customer service, good food and will recommend all to visit this restaurant
4
This place was recommended by a local friend and thus the visit. We sat on the footpath which had a good view of a beautiful mosque opposite. The service staff are Tamil and they are very efficient and sweet. We ordered chicken curry, murtabak, rusa and some rice, food was good and reasonable
4
This is one of our favourites when we come to Singapore. Easy location, air conditioned upstairs. We had the chicken murtabak and mutton biryani and two coffees. The mutton was a bit tough but the rice was nice and the standard sauces served with the murtabak were good and full of flavor. Cheap and quick and reliable.
4
The restaurant is located right across the street from Sultan Mosque, on the corner of Arab Street and Bridge Road, just a short walk from the Bugis area of Singapore.They make the murtabak in a front open air kitchen room, facing the sidewalk, with a big window, so you can watch them make it, and so when you walk past, youâ€™re tempted to stop in for a murtabak. And biryani is the best i've ever taste during visit in Singapore, worth trying. and affordable prices I could say.
4
If you like your biryani, head to zam zam for a no frills meal. The biryani is excellent. Not the service though. The waiters are gruff and don't seem happy at all. But that is really irrelevant. I was there for the biryani and not the ambience 
4
A little pricey but worth trying. This is my 2nd time.Ordered a Mutton Bee Hoon Goreng S$7 (without meat is S$4) and a tea tarik S$1.20 (please request for less sugar for your tea unless you don't mind having diabetes). Not really fantastic but good. I've tried their Mutarbak (forgot its chicken or mutton filling) on my 1st. Nice as well
4
Zam Zam is an unassuming looking restaurant at the edge of Kampong Glam. But their mutarbak and nasi briyani are worth going back for. The meat is tender and succulent and the aroma as you wait for your meal to be served is almost too much to bear. My favorite part at the end was the tapai (fermented glutinous rice dessert) which they sold at the payment counter. Sweet and slightly sticky - the perfect palate washer after a hearty meal
4
Perfect place for an Indian quick bite. Loving mixing my Briyani and Mee Goreng. Best to go with 4-6 people so you can share more dishes together. Delish Indian Muslim food, especially the Murtabak.
2
Maybe this kind of food is not for people who has never tried Indian food. The taste and the flavor are strange. I could not finish my food, just it 1/3 of it.
3
Good Indian Muslim food, especially the mutabak. Always have it with side dishes, if you are game for chicken innards then you will like it. Wash it down with a cup of Teh Terik
5
Zam zam restaurant is a halal indian style place which offers beriani rice, Love this dish, only 6 singapore$ and your tummy will be full in this. And it is not spicy too... just 1 min walking distance from Feel At Home
4
Had the mutton 'Murtabak' for breakfast, (so much tastier than cornflakes), even watched them make it. 'Teh Ice' was sweet, tea flavoured without tannins.
Cheap, honest and flavourful. Love this place.
3
I think zam zam restaurant was value for money I found the murtabak and biriyani good.I found the location ideal near bugis street
4
Very much crowded. Long waiting time. Slightly overrated. Food not that special. Nothing special. Not worth visit
2
It just happens to be on a touristy spot, food is mediocre. Service is good, interiors are pretty ok but that doesn't matter. I repeat, food is just okay.
5
This restaurant is right across the street from the sultan mosque in SG. The restaurant is huge. At least part of it has AC. You get seated by some people who guide you to a table when you walk in, and you pay at the register on the way out. There are some smaller tables, but also long tables with many seats--don't be surprised if you share a table. As with most cheap places to eat in SG, bring your own napkins (this food is especially messy, so bring lots of them). I had the chicken murtabak and it wasn't spicy. I've had murtabak in other places in SE Asia, but this one was the best relative value. The smallest size murtabak is still a very large portion for one. There are many other foods to eat in addition to the murtabak--lots of curries. They also have a variety of drinks and sides to go with your meal
5
I had the chicken mutrabak and it was delicious! I'm usually quite sensitive to spicy food but I could handle this one. It was great for lunch-- a rushed one at that, and more than enough fuel for more sightseeing around Singapore. I think I got my money's worth for it, and I didn't have to wait long for it to get to my table
5
Staff was super friendly and helped walk us through the menu, providing suggestions, etc. Great, unbeatable value and delicious food.
4
I come to Zam Zam in the morning to have breakfast, you can easily order the food by pointing the pictures on the wall, this is a good place to enjoy indian food, but I think the price is a little bit expensive
5
The food was really good and the price and amount of food you get is unbeatable. If you want luxury don't go but if you want a great experience do.
5
Warm & friendly services, waiting staff gave us very good recommendation, fish head, chicken & Mubarak are super delicious at reasonable price. Look forward to next visit soon to try other dishes.

We stayed around Bugis Street and this is one of the restaurants that we visited. A very well known and established eatery since 1908. Situated at Bugis Street area and easily spotted due to its big and bright yellow signboard. It serve Halal Indian and Pakistani food, which is quite good and affordable.Pros of this establishment:- It is near to Masjid Sultan (Sultan Mosque), one of the important mosque in Singapore and customers can take picture of it while waiting for their food as it is so near. If you are sitting at the outside table, you can take pictures just by sitting LOL.- The food is good but I think they can do much better with the chilli sauce (I think they just used generic, 'sold in large plastic bottle and common restaurant used' chilli sauce) and cucumber that comes with the mutton murtabak.Cons of this establishment- It has a tight eating space at lower level and another eating space at upper levelWill be coming back to try the Nasi Beriyan
4
Just across the road from the Sultan mosque this long established eatery has survived the ravages of time. But the place is now old with no semblance of its glory days 15 years ago Food is clean and fresh but there's no atmosphere or ambience. Just eat and go. Prices are cheap cheap but not recommended if you are the fancy restaurant type. Well worth a visit if only to absorb the back street culture of Singapore rarely seen by a visitor to this island natio
4
I have always been a fan of chicken or mutton biryani till I have tried their beef biryani recently and it was mind-blowing. Fluffy basmati rice served with a good chunk of beef slathered in a peppery and flavourful gravy. The service staff took a very long time to take our order and likewise the food took a while. They served us our drinks when we were almost finished with our meals despite reminding them frequently
5
The food here is fantastic. Can get overly crowded especially during lunch hour and on weekends and during Ramadan, so do time your visit carefully. The murtabak is to die for, especially the chicken one, which chunks of chicken hidden in the layers of murtabak. They also have a drive by service where you can place from the comfort of your vehicle. Quite a novel idea for an eatery in this area
3
Not having eaten murtabak before, I was looking forward to lunch here with great anticipation. Portion sizes are quite large so you will definitely not leave hungry. My chicken murtabak was overpowered by the amount of onion throughout the dish. We also ordered a fried rice style dish and a flat rice noodle dish, both of which looked the same orange colour, and also tasted the same - these were a real dissapointment.Service however was fast and friendly, and the food was cheap. I suppose I can say we got what we paid for. The only let down here was the food really, as both value and service were top notch. Would I return - no
2
I ordered a fried fish, it had three pieces in the menu with vegetables around, but received one piece alone in a scratchy black dish. When complained, the guy laughed, and few minutes later just dropped another piece in the dish. The food quality was not bad though
5
I forgot the name of the drink, but it's an excellent one. Murtabak is also perfectly made. Very reasonably priced food. Thumbs up!!!
4
The staff brought everybody's food in time for Iftar. They were fast and accurate even though the restaurant was super full during Ramadhan.
The food was tasty and portions were more than enough to satisfy a hungry, fasting person.
4
Stay right in the corner of Arab area. Some hundred metres away from Burgis MRT station. Zam Zam restaurant is good place to experience. Try milk tea and beef murtabak after walking around in Arab area.
4
I had my breakfast here. The restaurant is just opposite the mosque. Murtabak chicken is very delicious and the portion is big, with just $6. Will definitely visit again if I come to Singapore.
4
Been to this outlet once, saw it highly recommended on other sites. Food is good but not great, it just too touristy that may be the reason for the high volume of customers, other than that there are better ones out there.
3
I went there to celebrate my mother in law' birthday. We ordered murtabak and nasi briyani. Damn shiok!
The briyani has many spices and herbs. Best place for murtabak!
5
A friend recommended Zam Zam. I'm pleased he did.
We ate very well. Quality cuts of meat, generous portions, superb flavours. And excellent value.
Indian/malay cuisine is definitely worth experiencing. Go to Zam Zam and you'll soon realise how excellent it is.
4
try the new flavors that the restaurant offers. Taste of Asian cuisine that rich in spices. try Biryani, and the Famous Murtabak. Most of the menus are offered in fairly large portions, sharing with travel companions may be better
3
We had Fish Biryani and Mutton Murtabak. The fish was very tough and not overly nice. The Murtabak was OK but certainly nothing exciting., I think that the best part were the sauces that came with the meals. Would I recommend this particular Murtabak restaurant I would have to say no
5
Among the famous ones in Singapore. My dad would come here every time we drive south to Sg. Kinda hard to find parking but if you're ordering takeout, it's basically like a drive-thru. They'll take your order and deliver to your car. Generous portion. Definitely a must-try
4
Nice!!! the food is nice and the staff is good. the only cons is very hot. will definitely come again...
3
The place is know for it's murtabak and rightfully so.
The customer service a very different story. They managed to constantly mess our order up, with the drinks and food we ordered.
4
Good place for a cheap meal. Try the Murtabak - but beware it is very filling: a medium will fill you up and more!
4
This place is well known and for good reason, it's cheap by Singapore standards and is authentic well cooked food. Pity there's no beer but it's Muslim owned and operated with Halal certificate.
5
Zam zam is a restaurant located in the Arabian part of Singapore. It is located directly opposite majidul sultan. All you do is take a seat up stairs or down stairs and order your great food. Murtabak with chicken is a speciality.
5
I got information about this restaurant from trip advisor, coincidence when it was looking for food close to the hotel rochor 81. this restaurant can be reached with 10-15 minute walk from rochor or bugis. According to information this restaurant is cheap and tasty, and always crowded. My favorite is mutton briyani, the meat is very tender. I come to zam zam restaurant 2 times with different day, and will come here again if visiting singapore
3
Well the place is very well known and I have seen people of different ethnicity enjoying food here. I tasted the main attraction Murtabak in three flavours : Chicken, beef and deer. All the items were not as hyped in the internet. Of course the hype is due to the exclusivity of the dish rather than the quality or taste. I expected a lot better. The curry sauce that comes with it is tasty. I also had mee goreng there and that was totally tasteless. I don't know if that is usual or a regular thing but my family members were very disappointed. Only good thing was the chicken murtabak along with the curry sauce.
5
Zam Zam is an Indian Muslim restaurant in Singapore that has been around since 1908. It was recommended to us by several locals when we asked where to buy good murtabak. There is a beautiful mosque across the road that has a museum dedicated to the history of Indian Muslims in the area which as apparently open to the public (we did not go because of a monsoonal deluge).The restaurant is fairly basic by Western standards. But we weren't there for the decor but to eat the speciality dish, murtabak (pronounced seemingly a muttabub). It is a flaky flat bread stuffed with a savoury meat filling, served with a spicy dipping sauce and flavoured cucumber on the side. When done well it is delicious. At Zam Zam it is very well done.The dish comes in five versions, mutton, beef, chicken, sardine and deer. We had mutton but a local later suggested we should have had the deer which is apparently the most tender version. However, the deer was a little more expensive, $10 rather than $6 so the difference isn't large.Our two mutton serves which filled us quite well cost six Singapore dollars each. But the cashier did short change us by a dollar when we paid. At the time we were the only tourists in the restaurant.Upstairs has air conditioning but the stairs are very steep. Downstairs has the open-fronted ambience of an old part of Singapore.Staff were helpful and friendly. After we had eaten we stayed a while waiting for a tropical rainstorm to stop and they did not mind us waiting and taking up a table for an extended period. They were also happy to flag down a taxi for us when we did leave.All round, an interesting and very tasty experience
4
This Indian Muslim restaurant serves authentic meals. After you choose your sittings downstairs or upstairs you will be handed menue to choose your food and drinks. Meaty murtabak and authentic roti parts with chicken are must. There are other meals such as aromatic roti parts etc...
4
It's a must-visit place to have a taste of the famous Murtabak Singapore. The chicken murtabak is very tasty and filling. Didn't try any biryani. Choose a table outside the restaurant, if you want to eat while people-watching. Though they have air conditioned space at the upper floor. The restaurant is opposite Masjid Sultan. You can see the locals keep coming to this place, and restaurant staff taking their orders from the car. The staffs are friendlier than those from adjacent restaurants. Will come again in future. Do visit the restaurant. You won't be disappointed.
4
It has been operated since 1908 and the oldest in Singapore. The food was so good. I had chicken biryani and it is delicious. Will try the famous Murtabak on my next trip. Nearby MRT: Bugis
5
We were recommended to go here by a local. Place was packed but the service was still good and food was delicious. Super cheap too. Definitely try this place again when next in Singapore.
2
The food was okay nothing great. I would not go back probably. You can get better biryani in little india
5
we love love lovveeee its muton nasi biryani and beef murtabak! super yummy food, reasonable price, and halal.
5
We came here to have mutabak that we headed so much about, it made out of dough, onions, eggs, we ordered the beef and it was amazing!!!! Served with a curry sauce oretty tastey, they also give u some cucumbers wkth katchup on it - didnt get that but i ordered more katchup! Place takes cash only. Seating available outside on the curb, inside and upstairs! We ordered ice tea but came with milk it was pretty good but not your typical ice tea! We ordered the small plate and it was huge! Must try!!!
4
We simply had to check out this place as it was highly recommended by locals. We came in around 10:45am and the place was already opened. We were lucky to be ushered to the second floor, as only the second floor is air-conditioned. When we came in, we were among the first to be seated on the second floor. It was a very good thing as within 30 minutes the place was really packed. Food ordered :i) the chicken murtabak (crispy pancake bread on the outside and generously filled with chicken inside). By the way, this restaurant specializes too in deer murtabak. But we did not ordered it.ii) Chicken briyani - the piece of chicken served per dish is really huge for one person. The meat was really tender.iii) Fish briyani - lovely fish curry, not too spicyFor drinks, we ordered teh halia (ginger tea), which was lovely and "limau ice" (which is ice calamansi) - perfect to cleanse the palate and very very refreshing.Service might be a tad slow, but not bad coming from a restaurant that is always full
4
We were looking for a typical and tasty experience on Arab Street. According to a friends recommendation "you have to try Murtabak," the bread-looking-like dish (freshly made on hot stone).To be honest, we first meant to pass Zam Zam and check out other places along the road, because the tables next to the busy street didn't look as comfortable. BUT STAY THERE! It is a real street food experience.The food comes fast, you sit with local folks and it tastes originally. And you get good value for little money. Fun fact: Lean back and watch people order food directly from the car ;) Afterwards, we recommend going over to Sultan Mosque. It is for free, but check out the opening hours before. Enjoy
1
It's a terrible experience. We went as a big group after work hungry and sit there for 1 hour and just drinks and mutabaks are served. Servants are hard to call, and the environment is terrible narrow full of seats. In the end, it turns out the servant didn't order other dishes at all! And when we ordered, he did confirmed with us, and we asked about the other dishes several times
5
We were a group of 18 people from allover the world. We went there with no expectations and this place really delivered! Don't get fooled by the appearance of the place, since it could do with a make over. We were all impressed about the quality and taste of the food. The people working there are very very nice and it was easy to notice that they enjoyed so much our reactions to their wonderful food!!Thanks guys, very well done!!A well deserved good reputation on you
5
You know you have found a great spot when you have to wait a few minutes for a table since the place is packed! And you are only if the only tourists in the place since it's full of locals! This popular place, which has been here for years! Is in a great location, in the heart of the glam district, right by the temple, on the corner. I love local food, and was excited to try this murtaback bread that everyone was raging about! We only had to wait a few minutes, and we're seated on the top floor. The service was quick even though the place was very busy!!! Our waiter was very nice and so helpful in helping us first timers decide on their huge menu! I ordered the famous bread stuffed with chicken and spices and the portion is enough for a few to share exp if you are trying a few dishes like we did! Everyone was great, but I loved that murtaback bread! I didn't find it anywhere else in Singapore after that! It was amazing! Washed it down with ice coffees, and our bill was so low, best prices for such a great , popular restaurant! I wish we had time to go back again, and again! Loved it!
4
Not bad. Portion size good and crispy. Many other variety of food. Place is crowded during lunch and dinner
5
I was here 7 years ago. And now again. Food is still amazing.
Service and decor haven't changed much. Don't be expecting white linen tablecloths. This is more transport cafe style than fine dining. But authentic great food at fantastic prices.
5
Very authentic cuisine and certanly tried things not tried before. Very affordable, relaxed dining. All staff very friendly.
4
Get a seat on the second floor where the air-conditioning is strongest. Curries were wonderful and the prices were not too expensive
5
Great food especially the mutton murtabak. Fast service and clean. The best briyani and murtabak in Singapore!
5
Last day in Singapore revealed the best place for authentic food. Zam zam is the one place must visit for a Murtabak experience. The sardines version will blow out your minds. Unbelievable! Make sure you ask for all possible different side plate with sauces so you taste them all. Reason to go back to Singapore
5
We lived in Singapore in the early Eighties and often frequented this place. We have been back three times in the last 30 years and have witnessed the growing corporate nature of the restaurant. Couldn't believe the staff were wearing Zam Zam t-shirts! Food was lovely as always but felt it had lost some of originality and integrity as we drank from branded Zam Zam water bottles
3
Price is considerably cheap in SG. Food is Delicious, and Zam Zam does it best (I subsequently went and tried it at several other places---and Zam Zam does it best). If you sit out on the sidewalk, you'll have an awesome view of Sultan Mosque right across the street, not to mention a great people-watching perch
4
We visited on the 3rd day when we are in Singapore for our honeymoon. At first, we thought that this resto wasn't impressive at all. However so many visitors made us curious. So we dared to decide to try it. Hehehe. Amazingly we were shocked with our orders, meat small martabak and meat nasi briyani. The meat was so tender licking goooddddd. The rice was so fluffy stacked to our throat. Delicious and worth it to try. The price was so fair. The small martabak is only sgd5 and nasi briyani is only sgd6.5. Recommended for the tourists who wants India cuisine
5
Curry sauce and prata for breakfast... Couldn't get any simpler, cheaper nor yummier. Whatever gravy you go for, whether it's mutton, chicken or fish, you will not be disappointed. They also do murtabak and a huge selection of other dishes, which are all on show on the wall. Pick what you want and you will be served and NOT disappointed. I never know what to pick when I come here... But the safest foolproof option is of course prata and curry. Yummmmm....
4
Was craving some murtabak, and went here on the recommendation of a fellow traveller.
Worth the visit - fast service, great tasting chicken murtabak & awesome place to people watch.
Cheap & cheerful eats.
5
I would say this is they serve the best Chicken Briyani rice and murtabak in SG. Very good value for money. I recommend people to come here and enjoy the meal.
5
If you want to experience the unique fusion of Singapore's ethnicity, this place is must. The food is amazing and the prices are very inexpensive. Highly recommend.
4
We love Zam Zam - my favourite: cheese prata. So delicious, we went everyday for breakfast.
Wanted prata for dinner but they would not make for us in the evening, this was sad.
But great tasting prata and curry sauce.
4
I was in Singapore on business (my sixth visit) and had the weekend off. I wanted to explore the Arab Quarter, and TripAdvisor highly recommended this restaurant. You'll know you've arrived when you hear the guy out front yelling "ZAM ZAM!!! ZAM ZAM!!!", and you've departed when you stop hearing the guy out front yelling "ZAM ZAM!!! ZAM ZAM!!!". But, in between---if you do it right---you'll experience one of the most satisfyingly delicious culinary gifts of your life: murtabak. It's kind of like a flaky pancake-omelette with some sort of curry sauce and meat inside. And Zam Zam does it best (I subsequently went and tried it at several other places---and Zam Zam does it best). If you sit out on the sidewalk, you'll have an awesome view of Sultan Mosque right across the street, not to mention a great people-watching perch.<3 Zam Zam murtabak
5
We came to this restaurant as part of a food tour and are so glad our guide brought us here! We had the lamb and chicken Murtabak with a variety of curries; my preference was the mutton where my husband preferred the chicken. The pancake was buttery, flakey, and crispy and the filling flavorful and tender! We ate a lot of delicious food in Singapore but this is the number one dish that I have been craving since returning home.
5
Price is considerably cheap in SG.Food is Delicious, I ordered murtabak and I gotta say you need to try this menu.One minus thing is that the order sometimes taking a little bit too long. It because they seems to cook and bring your menu with other customers.But it'sâ€‹ still acceptable an
5
The food is delicious. The Murtabak is served with curry sauce and cucumber. The price of some items arent displayed but they are willing to answer when you ask them. Staff is funny and friendly!!They will give you the totally bill to check after you order your food
5
If you didn't know about this place, it would be easy to walk past it. But it is incredible! I ate several dishes here, and all were fantastic, as well as greatly enjoying their teh tarik (?) and coffee. Wonderful hole in the wall with super friendly staff
5
I still can remember the taste. It is so yummy! We ordered Beef Murtabak & Chicken Briyani. The portion was so big! They also gave us the side dish of mutton arca, curry and cucumber with chili sauce to be eaten with the murtabak. I should have tried their mutton murtabak. Because the arca is soooo delicious. Will repeat again if I came back to Singapore
4
The chicken Murtabak was easily the best we have tried and the service was very friendly. This place is an institution in Singapore and shouldn't be missed!
2
Old style Restaurant, Not that clean , food is good but the Restaurant decoration is not good
24 hours working
4
if you'd like to try Malay food for affordable prices then this place is for you... many choices, fast service, lots of people.. enjoy.
4
We went there for late breakfast and the place was full. I had briyani mutton and I told my wife that I had never could finish up a breakfast with that kind of portion before.
4
This is a busy restaurant with tasty foods. Local singaporean foods are available here. Malaysian,Arabian & Indian style foods are available too.I loved the awesome taste of Murtabak & Nasi goreng. Due to large gathering of customers - They served late! Well trained staffs could help this restaurant to serve better. Sitting arrangements & interiors were average
5
We were recommended to visit this restaurant and visited along with another couple. We were not disappointed, authentic food and atmosphere - not for gourmet diners and if you like an alcoholic drink you won't get one here, but something to do if you want to live like a local in Singapore. 35SGD for 4 diners no alcohol though
5
As a Westerner we look for restaurants with clean tables and silver cutlery and sometimes forget you are there for the food. This little gem is close to the Sultan Mosque and gives you a fantastic taste for flavour adventure. It will almost certainly be busy......99% will be locals and that's great. There might be some clutter on the tables but that's because it has such a traffic flow of guests. We had a mixed selection of dishes and without exception they were all fantastic. No upset stomachs from any of the party. Go there for the atmosphere and go there for the food. You will not be disappointed. It's also very reasonably priced. If you'd like a beer with your food you can't as it is a dry restaurant but this shouldn't put you off
4
I wouldn't tell someone to come here for the amenities. It is plastic chairs and low 'wow' factor as far as decor. It is similar to the dozens of corner restaurants sprinkled through Singapore.That is to say the food here is fantastic. Middle eastern with some Indian touches. It was crowded when we came, and I believe for good reason
5
We read the review on trip advisor and boy o boy we were not disappointed at all. The biryani is yummy. The cheapest biryani in town. They sell murtabak which is ideally (finely milled refined and bleached wheat flour) chapati and egg. Its a scam. Its very oily as well. U can safely try the chicken and mutton biryani. They also sell Deer biryani (RUSA) which i didnt try though. another restaurant in BUGIS just like ZAM ZAM is JILANI restaurant which is again SG $ 6 biryani. equally tasty. Do not forget to carry ur own water as they charge a SG$ 1 for water of 500 ml bottle. Also SG $1 for tea (teh
5
Across the street from the Sultan Mosque, this eatery deserves it's high ratings. Get a street side table with beautiful views of the mosque. Food was great and the service was equally good. Servers were fluent in English and had great suggestions of dishes. The line of local cars getting take out demonstrates the food quality
5
The food there just suit me.The chicken murtabak really really delicious and I have never found such murtabak.It is a pretty big murtabak and can be eaten by three people.
5
Had a martabak big size for 9 singaporian dolars. I recommend this place especially if you want to eat good and cheap.
5
Authentic Halal desi / Indian food. We ordered beef biriyani and chicken fried rice. Both were one of the best I ever had. This should not be missed. Right next to Sultan Mosque. You won't regret it
5
Cheese Prata - delicious!!! Best curry sauce in Singapore.
Plenty of seating upstairs and nice blueberry juice! Great staff too.
5
This restaurant has been around for years, my husband ate here in the 60's when he was stationed in Singapore. It's nothing fancy and you may find yourself seated beside other people but the food is outstanding and authentic. Service prompt and super cheap. Not to be missed
5
The first time we went we sat downstairs and it was a little bit muggy, the second time we were directed to upstairs and the bliss of air conditioning. Their specialty is murtabak (a type of stuffed pancake/roti). We had the chicken both times and it was absolutely wonderful. The $8.00 version was a huge size as a main course for one and half and we had the vegetarian Nasi Goreng and the two together were more than enough to satisfy us along with two cold cans of Coke Zero which ended up being a cheap but very satisfying meal with a cost of $17.00 Singapore. The food was hot and the service was quick and recommend it to all as long as you don't expect 5 star with tablecloths. The food is authentic halal and across from a mosque so you see lots of locals eating here which is always a good sign

The vege murtabak isn't on the menu but I asked and they made it for me. Was yummy, went back a second time for it (takeaway) but it was very sloppy and much more sauce (curry I think) base used so was not as nice. Definitely a budget friendly find. Worth a visit even if it doesn't look the cleanest
5
I'll always visit Zam Zam for the warm beef murtabak (a type of stuffed pancake/bread). It's chewy, savoury and goes really well with fish head curry -- you've to ask for it and the complimentary curry has no meat/fish inside. Pair it with a cup of hot teh tarik (pulled milk tea) and you'll have a satisfying meal. I can usually finish a small murtabak (S$6) by myself but it might be more fun to buy a larger size and share, while trying other dishes such as briyani (they have deer briyani!), mee goreng, prata etc. Drawbacks:- food might take longer to be served during the lunch hour (12-2pm) as the place is full-house by then.- your clothes and hair will end up with a food smell even if you sit in the air conditioned area at the second floor so you might want to bring a clothes/fabric deodoriser spray

I go for breakfast and it already open at 8 am.I ordered chicken curry and mouton curry. I prefer the beef one because it's less spicy than the chicken.My 2 yo son also like the briyani rice even it is too hot for him and he didn't have bladder issues later. The price is average with others.I recommend this restaurant for you moslem traveler as one of halal culinary in singapor
5
It's all about the food. A Malay restaurant oozing dishes with colour and flavour. A good selection on offer ... but the star of the show is the delicious Murtabak. We had the chicken, which was outstanding.The service is quick and efficient. Upstairs is air conditioned. Decor isn't anything to write home about ... but the food is. The Nasi goreng and the curry went down nicely too.Will be going back there next time I'm in Singers
5
Managed to get very tasty veggie versions of Murtabak and a fried noodle dish. All washed down with a nice lime juice.
4
Fresh roti prata & other local muslim halal food joint with biryani , mutton curry & fresh fish curry
5
Really nice authentic Malay food
The murtabak is a must so us the biryani
And the milky tea yum
Be warned the place is not much to look at and can get pretty busy but the food is lovely
4
Nice friendly greeting and seated quickly. Worth noting tables are on quire a narrow pavement with people walking through. It is exactly opposite the mosque so easy to find. Quite limited menu but we went with the venison murtebek which was interesting and a bit of a taste revelation with a nice spicy curry sauce. Also Nasi Goran with chicken, which was good with generous amount of chicken. With lovely lime soda and iced tea we were 20 SGD so certainly couldn't fault the value.
5
Zam Zam is a busy place with a vibrant atmosphere, both downstairs and upstairs. Frequented by locals it offers an array of foods, but especially the murtabak is worth trying as it is tasty and filling. You can watch the cooking of the murtabak from the street near the entrance. Upstairs on the wall is a picture list of all the drinks they serve. Very worthy of a visit
4
This place deserves its high rating and constant patronage. It's a delightful little shop to taste the best of Muslim and Halal cooking. I shared one beef and one venison murtabak with my friend. The curry they give you to dip the murtabak in was delicious! I highly recommend this place if you're near Arab street and Hajii Lane
5
My husband and I searched out this place after seeing the murtabak on Migrationology.com. We stopped in for breakfast, and shared a table with a lovely young couple. Our breakfast was absolutely fantastic. We got the mutton and the chicken murtabak. The service was great, especially after our enthusiasm over our tasty breakfast was so apparent. Don't miss it
5
Came here with the whole bunch of me familia in November. I just remembered to write this review because recently, my cousin went there and she said the chicken murtabak is so-so. She was absolutely wrong! When my family and I dine here, we always order the usual - the biryani and the well-liked chicken murtabak! Thank you Zam Zam for creating the best halal food here in our homeland.
4
Zam Zam is great. We had the deer murtabak and fish head curry. I do not recommend the curry IF you've never had whole fish before - it is necessary to get around the bones. But Singapore is famous for the dish! The murtabak was solid, but you definitely need to order something saucy with it (otherwise it's dry). The service was excellent. We sat outside and had a lovely view of the mosque across the street
4
Thanks TripAdvisor reviewers-this quick, cheap n cheerful restaurant satisfied our curry craving! A must-visit if you're in the Arab district. We had chicken masala, briyani, 2 iced milo & iced lychee all for $16.50. How good is that! Not a place for a long leisurely meal- the waiters quickly take your order, bring your food & give you the bill. Superb food for the price. We will definitely go back.
5
In the beginning I thought the waiters was extremely pushy and a bit annoying. But the amazing food especially the chicken mutbarak makes up for this. Great food for a low price and nice view to the mosque
5
Highly recommend their murtabak. Best murtabak I have ever had.
ZamZam is near Masjid Sultan, and Arab Street.
5
Best Muslim foods in Singapore. I really love this kind of food , delicious , tasty , yummy. The location is not far from Haji Rd, You can enjoy so many things around here.
5
So this place is not fancy, has some seats inside and a few on the street but it has the most amazing chicken murtabak! Lots of locals frequent the place and i can see why! The service is quick and tasty. Very good value for money too!RegardsOma

Went for lunch w a Friend.Had chicken briyani, egg Prata and 2 Teh halia (milk tea with ginger).The chicken briyani is not really tasty as the chicken is not cooked in the rice. 3*Teh halia - taste more like normal Teh, with a hint of ginger. 2.5*Egg Prata is not bad but nothing to shout for. 3*The serving staff was quite pushy when my Friend wanted something light.Surprised to see many tourists
4
First time trying this type of food. Far exceeded our expectations. Great price especially for Singapore. Staff were friendly and helpful. Unfortunately, I do not remember the names of the dishes we ordered, but it all looked delicious. I would suggest asking about spice level of dish before ordering. Really enjoyed this place would like to go back
5
I had heard so much good reviews about restaurant Zam Zam so I had to go eat there!I ate chicken murtabak large (9 S$), chicken biryani (6,5 S$) and as a drink I had teh tarik iced milk tea.Everything tasted so good!Next time I'm going to taste deer murtabak!
5
I've eaten here 3 times in the past week and this place never disappoints. It's very similar to Tg's nasi kandar in Kuala Lumpur, both restaurants are simple and focus on the food. Neither look impressive from the outside and can easily be overlooked, but don't! The food is cheap for Singapore standards, and the quality of food is amazing. They do halal Indian food such as Biryani, curries and murtabak as well as Malaysian food such as Mee Goreng and Nasi Goreng. The service is prompt and extremely friendly, they are more than willing to help to ensure everything is perfect. A definite must if you're in Singapore!
4
I've been hearing a lot of good review about this restaurant. The interior pretty modest but the food taste good. Now I understand why a lot of Malaysian Malay who visited Singapore will always visit this place. The Mutton Briyani taste good and the meet is tender and melt in your mouth. Murtabak is tasty and pretty big in size too.. :) overall experience is excellenc
4
For some time I have been hearing about how good murtabak is from Zam Zam. I thought I would try it whilst visiting Singapore this time and I definitely don't regret it. They had a deer murtabak (had never heard of it) so I thought I would try it. I found it amazing and we also ordered a beef one which was good. Overall a decent meal and definitely worth the reputation.
5
My go to place for murtabak and tea Tarik in Singapore. Highly recommended, and easy to get to (short walk from Bugis MRT)
5
Ok do not care from what part of the world you are from, if you like your food as it should be please visit. For singapore its not expensive and the quality is excellent, up to you, but you have been advised.
4
Quick and cheap dinner ! Great variety on the menu .
Had the Chicken Masala and was full of flavour.
Would be nice if the food was a little warmer as the food was not fully heated through.
5
we went with their recommendations, ended up with about 6 plates between us!!
But the food was so amazing there was nothing left!! :)
The sweet milk tea was also delicious!
If you are in the Arab Street area, definately give this place a go.
4
A place to go for good, inexpensive South Indian (Singapore-style) meal. The biryani, murtabak and mee goreng are delicious. Crowded most of the time though it doesn't take long to find a seat. Just opposite the nostalgic, historical Sultan Mosque and Arab Street, a great place to sight see and shop for items that seemed to have stayed from Singapore's pre-independence
4
If you're into Indian Food like Murtabak or Briyani then this is the place. It's not a modern eatery. Quite run down place but the service is quite fast. Only expect good Indian food here and nothing else like nasi goreng. Not their speciality. Even I love eating Briyani or Murtabak I would not advise eating it every day to avoid high cholesterol coun
4
Lucky to be in a nearby hotel. This is the real deal with flavorful foods that quickly fill the belly. The deer murtabak was finger licking good... literally. My first time trying that. The mee goreng is delish to mouth and to the soul.If you love street foods, this is a great place. Opened since 1908. Seating is outdoors and sparse, but worth the inconvenience.
5
This is not a very fancy restaurant from outside. It locate just opposite Musjit Sultan just 5 minutes walk from Bugis mrt station.We tried chicken and mutton murtabak and also chicken curry. The taste was amazing. We love chicken tenderness and aroma of spices and herbs. There are 6 size of murtabak. The smalles one almost as A4 paper size. The price was cheap compare to size and quality.
4
This is the perfect place to satisfy your murtabak cravings. Murtabaks they made are filled with spices and the curry complementing it is vert tasty as well. Often we get murtabak with very dried filling but this one gives you the juices that you need to splatter your tatsebuds with. The place is a little hot, so grab a chance on the indoor sitting. Good for tourist who are exploring spices. Be treated by the sight of the Sultan Masque nearby!
5
My wife and I had lunch here and this iconic restaurant lived up to it's excellent reputation. Great food, unpretentious setting, excellent service and remarkably reasonable price. The murtabak was terrific, I ordered a beef version, my wife asked for the chicken. The curry sauce was tasty without being over spiced and our longan drinks were a perfect accompaniment. We'll be back very soon
5
been a year or so since last frequented. Murtabak is still one of the best around Singapore - mutton of course!.
Chicken briyani also very good.
4
We come here for dinner fairly regularly and always love it. The Murtabak is very filling and great for sharing.
4
The murtabak they served is a legend but I went there twice for their briyani.
It was the best that I had in Singapore.
5
I love to try street food in every place I visit and it's always make my day when I find a gem! This place is one of them! I've never tried murtabak before and I'm glad I tried it for the first time here! It's a delight! Filling, hearty and tasty! I look forward to try more dishes they make!If you like ur food very spicy (like Thai spicy:) make sure you tell them:
4
I visited this long-standing restaurant based on the recommendation of my tour book. I had the fish murtabak. The portions are very generous and it was (oily) very tasty! Very reasonable too and excellent service. Also, I could see the chef rolling out and swinging the dough. Freshly made
5
We visited Zam Zam on our 2nd night in Singapore, after searching for dinner close by our hotel, we opted for this place because of the fantastic reviews, and it did not disappoint. It's easily found on North Bridge Road opposite the Sultan Mosque and close by Bugis MRT. The place was bustling for a Monday night when we arrived and we were greeted warmly. Opt for a table upstairs to make use of the air conditioning on a hot Singapore night. They have an array of drinks to choose from, I went for the lycÃ©e juice which was delicious. We both decided to try the Murtabak as this is what the place is famous for and it was incredible! I would recommend this dish if you are visiting. The prices of the dishes were extremely reasonable for the portion size and flavours! Service was extremely good also. Overall a fantastic meal in the heart of Singapore especially if you are staying in the area and don't fancy venturing too far, we will definitely try and visit again!
5
I arrived in Singapore with only a few hours to spare and my first priority was a good meal. After reading some other TA reviews, Zam Zam is the place I triangulated based off of price, distance, and authenticity. As the other reviews suggested, I was not disappointed! Delicious and inexpensive Indian food, helpful staff. I will certainly be eating here again when I come back
5
During my recent visit to Singapore, i was invited by my friends for early dinner at Zam Zam Restaurant located right in front of Masjid Sultan, the one and only mosque allowed aloud azan in Singapore. I ordered lamb baryani and black coffee. It's so delicious and the service, super fast. They also provide drive through with super fast service like, make a wish, within couple of minutes, its ready. Really fantastic. The price of food here are very reasonable and comes with variety of serving sizes and variety of food from baryani, murtabak and many more. If you happen to be in Singapore, don't forget to indulge at Zam Zam.
5
Yummy biryani and murthabak... fast service and bustling ambience but love the neighbourhood and the freindly crowd. lookout for the extremely efficient little guy who calls out to you with a red turkish cap.. very cool guy and the kids loved watching the way the chefs rolled the dough for the murthaba
5
Look ma, here I am again! Thank you and thumbs up to Singapore Zam Zam Restaurant for the great, satisfying food and service. Simply love the chicken briyani and murtabak. My all time favourite. Last but not least, despite the generous toppings n portion, price is still reasonable. Good job folks! Recommended to all food lovers out there. Good, better, best.
5
We had dinner at zam zam. We ordered chicken murtabak, mutton murtabak and fried bihun. All of them tasted so good that we still miss it until today. Will definitely revisit zam zam if we ever go to Singapore again.
4
This is my favorite briyani in town, period. Taste have been much consistent, pricing still remains quite competitive to the other shops around the area. Also try the traditional teas they have.
1
went for supper and ordered a kway teow goreng and I was asked whether what meant I want. so I ordered a chicken kway teoh goreng and on the menu behind the cashier was showing $4. I was charged $7 when the food come and I was told if there is meat it is $7 and they shown me the menu outside the restaurant. I find I had been cheated as the menu they shown me was not indicated the price. I am OK to pay if the price has been indicated as I like the food. just an dishonest practise.
2
Place is a nightmare for parking, but you can utilize the rare service of drive by take away. Just stop outside the place and the staff will be waiting along the road to take orders. I think this is really convenient. However, i have tried this 4 times and on 3 occasions they got the orders wrong. Best to double check before you drive off. If not be prepared to get a missing Briyani or Murtabak. The mutton Briyani and Fish Masala are good here
5
Great place for Indian food and curries at local prices. The roti Prata was crispy and tasty, curries were also spicy and delectable! Staff was super friendly and service quick! To top the experience, I left my wallet at the restaurant only for them to call me hours later (even before I noticed the loss). Wallet was returned, everything intact! Overall excellent meal and experience
3
Apparently when you search "murtabak Singapore" on Google, this place pops up as the first result.We wanted to try this traditional dish at this very busy place.There are mostly locals eating here and the staff is fast to take you order and to have your dishes ready.We tried the mutton one and the venison one (they claim the deers are from Australia). Both were quite good. They serve three sized of each plate: small, medium, large (except from the venison that is available only in small and large sizes); the medium one is enough for a person.The food is very cheap
5
We saw this place whilst on the open top bus tour and wanted to try Murtabak. We were very lucky to have spotted it as it is reviewed as one of the best places to eat this dish.It was delicious. We ordered two small portions but should have shared one as they were huge. It was only 6 SD per portion.It is tiny and we sat at a table on the pavement watching the traffic, but we love al fresco dining, especially when it is 33 degrees!This is a cheap and cheerful place to eat for a quick lunch stop
4
We came across this whilst visiting the Sultan Masjid in Singapore, it was busy and certainly wasn’t lacking in character so we decided to give it a go. This is typical of the street type restaurant you find in this part of the world, and certainly not an establishment you visit for its décor. We opted for the Murtabak, which seemed to be one of the main dishes on offer here, and lamb biryani, from the somewhat limited menu. The food arrived promptly and on the whole was very good. The Murtabak wasn’t to my liking, comprising of a stuffed fried pastry with a minced meet and potato filling with egg. On the other hand the lamb biryani was absolutely delicious and I certainly could have had another wholes one before I left. It was full of flavour and the meat was also nice and tender.I should also note that the prices were definitely on the low side, providing terrific value for money.On the way out I ordered a tea to go, which was certainly very uniquely served - in a plastic bag, with a straw and strings attached to the bag to hold it! Very strange if you are used to Starbucks Coffee mugs
5
This place was delicious - really, really delicious. We ordered the chicken murtabak and the beef biryani and loved both of them equally. This was my first time eating a murtabak, but it made me want to order one every time I saw it on a menu in Singapore. The biryani delivered exceptionally tender and juicy beef in a fragrant rice. Had we been in Singapore a day longer, we would have made a second visit.I also HIGHLY recommend getting a tub of their pineapple cookies. They are reminiscent of Taiwan's pineapple cakes and go extremely well with coffee. We picked up a tub on our first day and had 2 cookies with coffee every morning in our hotel room. I wish I could have tried their other treats, or even picked up a second tub to bring home with us.More practically: the restaurant is open quite late. We ate a medium-sized chicken murtabak and beef biryani and walked out stuffed. Pop over to nearby Haji lane afterwards for live music and bars
4
This place is pretty bare bones, but you can't argue with the reasonable prices and outstanding murtabak (kind of like a more filling, even better roti prata). Tried the chicken murtabak and beef murtabak and could not decide which was better as they were both SO good. Delicious when washed down with an iced Milo. Great spot for a quick lunch while sightseeing in the beautiful surrounding area
5
Good Service, Good Quality, True Value..... Awesome Taste.... Compare with Little India Restaurants Cheap and Best..
5
When it comes to Murtabak, look no further than to have it at Zam-Zam. My family and myself have been patronising this restaurant for years and it doesn't disappoint.
3
Average food with good customer service. Unfortunately ,we had better Briyani then Zam Zam so didn't like the Briyani or any other food. Family with babies should get take away as it not babies or kids friendly.
4
I went there for lunch with friends. We had to wait a bit as it was full ! The food was goood. I asked for vegetarian murtabak (not on the menu) and they made one without problem. However it is definitely not the cleanest/fanciest restaurant in Singapore :
4
I have always come by this restaurant whenever I am in town, and as usual the restaurant has never seizes to disappoint me.The service was fast and the food as always, tantalized my palate. This time around I had the chicken biryani and packed a big packet of murtabak. The restaurant is set up in a very authentic building which is very colonial but the interior has been modernized with full functioning furniture, air-cond, TV and even has wifi, not great but yes, its available. But as usual, the restaurant is pack during rush hour with tables you need to share with strangers, unless you don't mind waiting forever.The waiter was quick with the order using a mobile device so that he gets it right. Despite being busy and sharing with others, the bills comes accurately to us. Despite being busy, the staff always serves with a smile.As a whole, this restaurant is a nice place to have a great meal. The place is clean but the ambience isn't great. It isn't a 5 star rated restaurant and is not exactly one you will go for a romantic dining, not even for business. But if you are keen on getting good food of great quality and taste, you cannot go wrong coming here
4
We tried the mutton and sardine murtabak- surprisingly, I liked the one with sardine more. But, both were worth trying. Prata was delicious, heavy and a perfect comfort food. It came with fish curry, chicken curry and daal. All three were mouth watering, but the fish curry came out on top. We tried the mutton briyani too- quite good but not great.There were three of us and we really stuffed ourselves. But, we paid s$ 28 for all of it. Talk about serious value for money
4
They will find a table for you immediately. It is a basic menu yet with a well sufficient choice. You order and a some minutes later Food arrives, I would not call it waiting time. The Food seems like homemade, really good but not fancy at all. You want really good Food on a small Budget - a good place to go. Another good Thing: it serves late when many Restaurants in the neighbourhood are closed
4
This place comes highly recommended and we were definitely not disappointed. Never mind the decor, you come for the food. The murtabak is what this place is known for and it was delicious. Judging by how busy it was lords of other people think so as well. Definitely worth avisi
5
Zam Zam is one of my go to favorites when in Singapore - actually a big statement when you think how great Singapore is for food.During my last visit I had the beef murtabak with the tasty curry gravy, an excellent lunch.The staff are pretty friendly and willing to help out the uninitiated with helpful tips.The place always seems packed and for good reason
4
We came here with an expat local, as we walking through. What looked like a seedy little venue turned into a gem, they send you upstairs where easily 100 plus local were sitting & enjoying the food. There was 9 of us joining the locals, food was fantastic & came out in very quick time, my daughter had Nasi Goreng & most of us had burek with different meat and a drink each all for $8 Singapore dollars. Recommend it highly
3
This is a restaurant of yesteryears These restaurants of those years like Islamic restaurant Jubilee restaurant and the existing zam zam restaurant were well known then They were known for their briyanis and murtabak mutton chicken varieties
Ambience poor food average
5
awesome place to taste murtabek and also dal , iam a regular diner at this place ,great food ,,,tasted fish here and it was yummy
4
What a great hole in the wall middle eastern food experience. Their lamb Murtabak was so good. Got it togo and it came with 3 condiment sauces.
5
The best place to go for murtabak. So delicious! We went twice and were only in Singapore for fours days.
4
Not been here for ages and decided to have the murtabak with an overseas mate. Just like the old days, good food. Glad they maintain their old look not turning it to one of those expensive diners.
4
I order mutton briyani and mee goreng. No need wait any longer, the food is already on the table! They also serve a big portion.
4
the service was very quick, the taste is very good. i ordered murtabak for medium size because the servant said that it's for two people, but i guess the medium size can be eaten by 4 persons.
3
@TheKuoKnowsZam Zam has been around for about as long as I can remember. It is probably one of the best exponents of Indian-Muslim food in Singapore.The restaurant might not look like much from the outside. But that belies some of the best examples of the unique Indian fare on the island. And it's not expensive.There are probably two must-try items on the menu. The first is the Murtabak that comes with a choice of fillings. But whether you opt for chicken, beef, mutton or sardines - yes, sardines - expect a portion that could feed a flock of gannets.The Biryani is well worth trying too. Again, expect a generous heping. If you can't finish everyting in one sitting, don't be embarrassed to ask to take any leftovers home.Service can be a little wanting at times. So try to avoid the peak hours or face a long wait.Also be prepare to share your table with other diners. It can be a great way to see what others are eating, whilst sipping on a glass of ice limau. It might just provide the inspiration for your next visit
5
We came to Zam Zam after watching another Mark Wiens youtube video. It turned out to be another exceptional recommendation.The venue itself is nothing special...it's very basic.....but their is A/C in the upstairs seating area which makes it more comfortable. The service is prompt, friendly and efficient. But it's the food that makes Zam Zam such a memorable experience.....we had chicken and beef murtabaks (chicken was easily the winner!!) and also chicken biriyani which was delicious. And it's all at great-value prices!But it's all about the murtabak. You know it's good when you crave it weeks and months later.Just go there!!
4
Service was super fast. We ordered plain briyani to go along with boneless fried chicken and masala chicken.Soft and succulent pieces of meat. Comes with a portion of dhal and chicken curry. Pickles totally compliments the dish. Ask for more as they only serve 2 pieces !
4
We sat to have a drink in the heat but didn't miss the famous dish murtabak which was very tasty. It is something like a pie stuffed with spicy aromatic meat and was great.
4
Typical breakfast to have Indian murtabak in the morning. Here we ordered plain murtabak, mutton murtabak and egg & onion murtabak, warm and crispy served with Indian curry. Though a little spicy but very tasty, something nice for a change.
4
Nice food, nothing fancy. Very tasty! Quick service. A few tables outside , most inside at the first floor. Enjoyed the 2 meals I had there.Good home made ice tea drinks (though you need to pick randomly from the list if you don't know what is what, lol
5
Had read about this restaurant, so hunted it out. The restaurant is very lively and busy with locals, we were the only Westerners in there. We ordered the recommended murtabak and thoroughly enjoyed them. Two of our party returned the following evening to repeat the experience and they waiters were very pleased to see us again. Extremely cheap food without losing the quality
5
Casual dining with convivial atmosphere. Rather chaotic seating but the glorious cuisine was the key focus. The crispy skin of the murtabak was unusual. The minced meat was evenly spread out and each bite was a bliss. The teh-tarik was a perfect equilibrium of tea, milk and lightly sugared. Pure sublim
5
This is definitely one of the best restaurants that offers best quality Indian and Muslim cuisine. The variety of food here serving from noodles to rice and Spicy to sweet . It also offers different types of meats like deer, mutton , beef , fish and chicken . I like the Mutton Briyani , murtabak and the Teh Tarik the most . Strongly recommend others to try 
4
Zam Zam has been around for ever and is still packing in locals and tourists alike.This is a no frills place to go if you want a quick, filling ,decent quality meal.If you want air con ask to go up to the second floor.The staff are quick and helpful, I had two onion Roti prata they served them with a bowl of very tasty spicy gravey,two are filling.my husband had a small chicken murtabak,which was quite big.....which was filled with plenty of good quality chicken,but was a tad dry,it came with some sliced cucumber in sauce and he had a bowl of of the spicy gravey which overcame the dryness.we had a portion of spinach a can of ice tea and I had a mug of the local style ice hallia tea (ginger) which I love. The cost S$14 for two full and happy campers.It may not be to everyone's taste as it can get packed noisy and a bit frantic,but it is so worth a visit,there is not too much choice for veggies but you wont go hungry 
5
We discovered this gem quite by accident &,luckily it was just around the corner from our hotel. We only had two days in Singapore which wasn't enough time to enjoy this wonderful city.The food at Zam Zam's was to die for, especially their murtabak selection. The prices were extremely reasonable & the service excellent. We had a 9 hour stopover in Singapore on the way back from our holiday in Koh Samui,so went back to Zam Zam's to try it, yet again. Superb & the meal sizes are huge. Next time I'll share!.
5
I came here twice during my 3-day-visit to Singapore because the Martabak is so good. The beef martabak is similar to "martabak telur" that we have in Indonesia, but with onion insted of scallions inside, more meat, and different skin texture. I prefer Palembangnese martabak's curry, but it was still sooo good. The best part? It's only $5 for the small one, and it's not small at all, more than enough for two persons. And it's best paired with iced tea!
4
In the locality of Arab street opposite the infamous Sultan mosque, you will delight yourself in spicy murtabak (flour pizza stuffed with spicy chicken or mutton or beef with chopped onions) coated in egg to be enhanced further by dipping in curry. You can determine your level of spiciness.Another staple is the chicken, beef or mutton briyani (basmati rice cooked in saffron and turmeric) which is very flavourful and mixed with the curry gravy you are in curry heaven. The pickles of cucumber will balance the spiciness.Mee goreng with bits of mutton and peas fried in chilli and tomato is a local Indian favourite and welcomed by four races of Singapore. The Indian chef have also introduced Nasi Goreng (fried rice with ikan bilis (enchovies) fried in cut green chillie).At the food counter downstairs a variety of curried prawns, meats and vegetables will delight everyone's palate.To lower the spiciness an endless drink list is given.For four we spend a reasonable $31.50 with drinks
5
They have quite a selection of Muslim and Indian food but the best is the Nasi Briyani. We tried the fish masala and it was fantastice as well.
4
The food is good and price are greats but many other recent offer the same type of food for the same price in Singapore. Don't know why this one is more famous than others. But still, it remains a safe option!
2
Brought a visitor after reading some reviews from TA. Wished I went to one next door instead. The staff was rowdy and rude. The Murtabak is overrated.
5
It's awesome! The beef murtabak at Zam Zam Restaurant Singapore is uncomparable. It's thick, crunchy and super delicious. Will definitely come again.
5
One of Singapore's best places for a good Murtabak and excellent Nasi Goreng Kampung. Great service even if the place is crowded
5
Based on popular reviews, I decided to try this and was glad to have not missed it. Located just opposite the Sultan Masjid, it is one of the best joints for having Indo-South Asian food at affordable prices. Tried their Chicken Biriyani (SGD 6.50) and the popular Bandong drink (flavored rose milk) (SGD 1.50). Place can be extremely crowded given the popularity but seats can be arranged with a waiting time of 05-10 mins.

A friend took us here to try the local favorite, murtabak, a folded bread resembling a crepe with meat and eggs inside. It is dipped in a semi-spicy curry sauce which significantly increases the taste. We tried different dishes - the mutton murtabak, beef briyani (I was used to calling it biryani back home), chicken murtabak. My version had minced mutton, garlic, onion and egg inside. It is huge, probably good for 2 people. Came with 2 sauces: curry and tomato sauce. Texture-wise, it is soft, somewhat chewy. Taste-wise, it is easy to eat, even for a foreigner. I managed to eat about 3/4 of my murtabak due to its size. Topped it off with cold glass of lychee drink. Very nice dinner. Price is affordable, too. No wonder the place is packed, even extending to tables outside the restaurant. Next time, I will definitely try their chicken biryani.

Used to be brought here as a child and on a recent visit to Singapore, my elderly father insisted we visit again. Not up market cuisine by any stretch of the imagination but if you want to experience authentic south Indian curries in an authentic environment, then this is the place for you. A good meal stop too for tourist visiting the Arab Street area. Mutton mysore one of my favourites; murtabak (Indian savoury pancake) always a favourite and make sure you have the fresh lime to drink. On your way out, pick up some delicious packages delicacies, the pineapple tarts are always good

This place you will only find if you get of your but and see the real Singapore. Whilst the city is being taken over by sky scrappers this sits at the top of Arab street which unless you go off the usual 5 star route you won't get to. It sits in the Indian Arab quarter and is really a local cafe. No posh tables, no fawning waiters just great Indian food which you can get lunch for two at under $10. We has Nasi goreng and a the local speciality and it was superb. It's cheap it's great food and it gets busy with the locals which says a lot. If you want 5 star hotel treatment do go but if you want great food in authentic surroundings it's the place to go especially on a budget

There is nothing fancy about Zam Zam, sitting next to the smoke filled cooking area on simple plastic chairs is what you have to expect. The food is plain but often the only place in the neighbourhood, that is open early in the morning. Just watch your money! I was given Malaysian Ringgit as change, which I didn't notice immediately because the Singapore 20 $ note is the same colour as the Malaysian one. Quite a neat but nasty trick, not appreciated. The Malaysian currency is worth only one third of the Singapore Dollar. They will not see me again

Lively and authentic restaurant in a cool and funky spot in Singapore. If you are ever going to try some famous Murtabak this definitely the place to do it. Quick, friendly and efficient service.

Frist time I come here,my friend is second time,I follow him come here,try Arab food in Arab St.Really nice,My Friend love it,me too.Hope I come backs agian.

Visited Singapore with family and enroute to hotel taxi driver talked all about biryani and great food of zamzam. My hotel was close to Arab street so decided to go for lunch but after visiting place decided take away 2 biryanis and chicken fry.Service was lightening quick and in few seconds chicken arrived. And chicken fry in another few seconds.Person from the counter was friendly and helpful. Came back to hotel and open the stuff. Quantity was good enough for a person.But Biryani was just a average. Chicken in biryani was well cooked. Fried chicken was OK. We were hungry so finished the stuff. If you know how to prepare biryani or you ate really good biryanis in past. It is difficult for you to appreciate this biryani. Also this is local singapore cuisine so need to accept it.But as a Biryani.. Cannot accept it.I will never visit again to eat biryani at least. Better avoid it
5
I brought my family to this place cos i missed the food here since migrating to Australia. It seems the decor is frozen in time and the usual busyness of the restaurant that i had known 10 years ago is still present. We orded the chicken and beef murtabak which were quite sizable portions. The mee goreng was just right, at below $5per plate. The usual roti chanai with egg was unavailable as they only do murtabak. We also ordered the beef bryani and found the meat very tender. We thoroughly enjoyed the food there, sitting in the aircon 2nd floor.
4
We came here as we wanted some local Indian Muslim food.We ordered the Chicken briyani, which was one of their specialties. The briyani rice was grainy and tasty, but the chicken was a little dry. They provided us with Chicken curry gravy, which was a nice compliment to the briyani.We also ordered a small chicken martabak and it came with a plate of dhal gravy. The martabak was very soft and flavorful.The portion of the food was big and good for sharing. The price was reasonable too. We sat on the second floor of the shophouse, which was the air con section of the restaurant. The place was a bit old and dirty and seemed not very well maintained
4
Many travellers are pre adaptive to taste and it becomes quite difficult to change fooding habit due to travel. I love Biryani esp chicken n my 1st thing to explore while travelling is Indian restaurant which serves Biryani. Was happy with the food n service. Give a try n u ll love it definitely

You can't consider your visit to Singapore complete without taking advantage of all of the multi-ethnic dining choices that surround you. The "Arab Street" experience isn't complete without a walking tour and then dining at Zam Zam. You must try the Murtabak with your choice of ingredients. I like Beef Murtabak.This is a gritty experience if you, like me, are an Anglo and not used to hanging out in a Muslim restaurant with many non-English dialects being spoken here. Still, I made friends sharing a table with a very nice and knowledgeable Singapore Gentleman and we had a few laughs. The food is really inexpensive and quite tasty. This is not fine dining and English is limited with the wait staff. Upstairs area is air conditioned.I have eaten here before and always enjoyed a tasty meal. While there are dozens of great eateries in the narrow streets and alleyways of the Arab Street neighborhood, this is the original deal! Live life fully and give yourself a Zam Zam experience
4
Murtabak is what this restaurant famous for and you will not be disappointed. I ordered small size chicken murtabak and mutton murtabak. There were lots of tasty juicy chicken pieces in the chicken neuronal. The mutton was full of favour. I really enjoyed my meal there. Gave me different aspect of Indian restaurant in Singapore. 很好味的雞肉murtabak. 羊肉murtabak 充滿了香料。吃了很好的印度餐
2
I visited this restaurant after I read about it in trip advisor. Every one is talking about their Biryani. I ordered a chicken Biryani and I was very surprised with the quality and taste of that biryani. Below average, If you go to any other Indian restaurant you will find much better biryani. And the service is nothing, don't expect a good service over here specially when its busy. First and last time to be here
5
We loved eating at this local institution so much, that we returned a couple of nights later, despite having so much choice in the area. Food is fresh, filling and incredibly cheap. Service is fast. As other reviews testify, this is not a fine dining experience but definitely worth experiencing
4
Had it for breakfast 9am. 20 sg for a large. Good for 4 people. 2 coffee 2 tea total bill 24.80. Never tried other items on menu since in 8am they only serve those roti stuffed meat.
4
Everything was very good ! we took the 8 sgd murtabak for 2 pax. (which is enough but next time we'll try something more too :) )
3
Walking around Arab street, one wants to have local food. The place is an institution as it has been around for many years. Had the biryani but the sauce wasn't thick enough. Like juice a little dilute. Good and efficient but not memorable.
4
we ordered nasi biryani and Murtabak.Murtabak is stuffed parota,we can order chicken mutton or beef.price is very reasonable.
5
I've been dinning here since I was young and this gotta be the most authentic murtabak restaurant. Food is good and expect the place to be packed during the weekends.
4
Cheap and cheerful, full of character. Good food, onion could have been cooked more in the Murtabak.
Don't expect too much, this is not fine dining but an experience well worth going to.
4
There is a plenty of food here and the place is big enough because it has two floor. The service is fast, good and of course the king of dishes here is their "Murtabak". The best Murtabak I've ever ate. Bad side is, the prices. It will swallow your wallet though. Be careful when you ordered the Murtabak, one Murtabak is for two person because the portion is so big, I cannot finish it alone
4
The signature murtabak is quite good, crispy on the outside and tasty ingredients on the inside. The smallest size for about $6 is pretty much a full meal - not knowing how big it was, I also got some fish masala that was smothered in a rich spicy sauce, but the fish was rather firm and hadn't soaked up enough flavour for my liking. It's a simple roadside place like so many around there and in Little India, but the upside is great value food
5
The restaurant is situated in front of the Sultan Mosque at Arab Street, and is a 5-minute walk from Bugis MRT. We mainly wanted to try the Indian food, and realized they also serve deer Murtabak and Briani too! Both of these deer dishes are must-trys. I'd recommend having Teh Halia (if you prefer a gingerish-spicy drink) or Teh Tarik as drinks. The dishes overall are well worth the price and you definitely won't feel ripped-off. Don't let the cheap plastic theme of the restaurant fool you! Everything comes at a price, and while the chairs are plastic and the environment may feel crowded and noisy - especially on the weekends, meals are tasty, high quality, and price-worthy. The staff are friendly, caring, and quickly available.Tips:* Deer Murtabak and Briani are only served on Friday evenings and weekends.* Either reserve beforehand, or expect some waiting time during peak times since the restaurant is highly popular (which is a good thing)
2
I'm a vegetarian my partner eats meat so we tend to look and see what's on the menu first before going inside a restaurant. We both fancied a curry and thought great as we had seen on the menu that they had a vegetable curry and a Masala so we decided to go inside. When we sat down and went to order the vegetarian option it didn't exist!! However they could make me a rice without the meat in but not a curry which is what we were looking forward to. They also bought over a curry sauce separately and told me that I would be able to eat it as it had vegetable mixed with mutton?! Need to cater and understand those that are vegetarian would not recommend if you are one!
4
This is a good place to have quick and cheap food in Singapore. This place has one of the best murtabaks ins SIngapore!
4
Came here today with a friend for lunch. We had a biryani, a prata and a tea each all for just under $20. Very good value and decent food. Service was pretty efficient too. Surprisingly popular for this location on a weekday lunchtime.
5
Ordered Nasi Goreng and Teh O Limau for lunch and I only spend S$15 for two portion! Can't say anything but the taste is very delicious and I'll be back here👌
5
Great Biryani, Roti Pratha and Indian curries, excellent food at a decent price, not a fancy restaurant,
4
We was brought here as part of our day tour of Singapore and the Murtabak was recommended to us. There was a choice of either Deer, Beef, Chicken and even Sardine. We settled on having two between the four of us and had the deer and chicken. These came out as well as two bowls of a nice spicy sauce. The Murtabak reminded me of a stuffed Naan but both was very tasty and cooked really well. The four of us thought that the Chicken was the best. Great flavoursome food at a cheap price
1
First off they didn't have SEVERAL things that were on the menu. Then they brought the wrong dish and were clearly upset that we asked for what we ordered and to return what was brought out. Too many good places in Singapore to go to a place with unfriendly and rude service
4
This place used to be swarmed with a lot of people as the food served is nice. They serve indian food. They are halal by the way.They serve Murtabak, briyani, prata, and many more. Just ask what they have. It is opposite Sultan Mosque and so after your meal, you can just drop by for your prayers if you have not done so
4
Visited this restaurant while touring Arab Street. We were led here by TripAdvisor reviews describing a previously unknown dish called murtebak. We were very glad that we came.A murtebak is kinda like a giant flattened burrito. We ordered one filled with venison meat and it was absolutely superb! We thought in fact that it was the very tastiest dish that we enjoyed during our three days in Singapore.The murtebak are made to order with a choice of meats or can be made vegetarian. The small versions are large enough to feed two adults. Where the price range of 8 to $10 each, they are a really inexpensive and wonderful meal. It is served with a nice cucumber salad and a really wonderful brown gravy made with lots of delicious spices.The restaurant has apparently been in place for over 100 years. It's not a fancy place and you get to watch your meal being made on a large antique flat stove. We ordered our dish to go and heated it later on at the Pan Pacific Suites Hotel located just 3 blocks away.If we ever return to Singapore we will definitely look to enjoy a deer murtebak again. This unique and delicious dish is definitely worth finding at Zambia Zam
4
Excellent restaurant to sample local dishes like Biryani and Murtabak. Prices are reasonable and the service is quite good, able to cope with the steady stream of patrons during peak hours. Diners can choose to eat downstairs, or go to the nicer, air-conditioned dining room upstairs. Take-away service is efficient and speedy. No alcohol served --Teh Halia is a good choice for a beverage
4
I came here twice and I always order the Briyani Chicken and Beef. It was just lastweek that I ordered the Beef Murtabak. I think I would love to go back there and have the murtabak and iced coffee again. It was one of the best :) The place is always crowded and please do not expect for a nice nice place. But anyway, the food was nice
4
Its a well known and long que but absolutely fantastic...
I loved their briyani chicken and their teh tarik... Wow!
Great prices big portions good taste and soooo good.
Try and surely ull come back
4
my first time trying murtabak! quite satisfied! friend ordered lamb briyani which was also not bad! will bring other friends again
5
This restaurant was recommended by Mark Wiensa a travel food blogger. I tried chicken Murtabak, Chicken Briyani and Beef Briyani. Chicken Murtabak was the best. Restaurant is situated in Arab street almost opposite to Sultan Mosque. Just 5 minutes walk from BUGIS MRT.
5
we've been here many many times when passing through Sngapore. Dodgy little place. Plastic plates and tables/chairs straight out of the 60's. But if you love Indian food, roti pratha, murtabach, etc etc... you'll never find any better..I am salivating as I write this hahaha
4
Food is consistent, good Murtabak and curries at great prices. Great for big groups. Unfortunately no beer.
1
Don't be fooled by its Tripadvisor ranking, it's not at all what you expect. They make one sauce for all food (dark red) and cover it all in it. Don't waste your time going unless your after cheap chicken covered in sauce.
1
My friend and I arrived and he order murtabak and I ordered kurma mutton, first the waiter was rude and how he "ordered" us to our seats after he ignored. I ordered my mutton and veggies without rice and rolled his eyes on me for not ordering rice. I hope life teach this person a lesson. I will never step into this place again. PS I had indigestion after this meal. Thank you very much
4
We were nearby and decided to pop into Zam Zam as hubby has heard much about it. We ordered:• Beef Murtabak - Crispy outside and generous inside with beef and onion bits. $5 for a small one but fills you up! Good size for the price. • Egg Onion Prata - they don't have kosong Prata so I opted for egg onion to up the flavour! Like the Murtabak, the Prata is crispy and tasty! What's particularly even more yummy was the fish curry!! It's really good that I asked for TWO more top-ups!! The Prata curry combo is power!!• Chicken Biryani - we were not hungry but just greedy so we ordered a chicken biryani to share. Great decision as the rice alone is al dente and flavourful. The chicken is with not much sauce that I initially thought it would be too dry a plate to get maximum enjoyment. I was wrong! Every mouth a delight and I ate more than I said I was gonna eat. Heh• Teh Halia - this is my usual go-to drink and theirs didn't disappoint. Thick and sweet and gingery. Just the way I love it!!!The shop itself is a visual delight. Many things to see on the walls and around. Only after the meal did I realise that they have an Aircon upstairs. And they are apparently so famous that they made their own Zam Zam signs for patrons to take selfies with. They also sell their own bottled water!! And also their Zam Zam Polo Tee if you like!!! Amazing!Well, I'm just there for the food.
1
This place was recommended to us by our hostel owners so we decided to try it out. There were no prices on the menu, when one of us tried to ask about vegetarian options they were quite rude and said they were on the menu. They may have been but the descriptions of the food items were not in English so we had a lot of trouble ordering. The washrooms were disgusting and the second they brought over our food they slammed a bill down infront of us. The food itself was unimpressive. Some items were extremely small which we may have known if the menu was more clear to read. Everything was pretty tasteless and unappetizing
4
I've been here several times, but somehow, the first time was the best time. Next time I'm in Singapore, I might try somewhere else. Don't forget to eat with your right hand. It's messy, but fun.Seating: There are many seats as the restaurant has several levels, with the top level being ideal for big groups BUT there are load-bearing poles and the seats and tables are squished together so it is difficult to enter and exit.Drinks: The tea tarik was very nice but must be served hot, not warm. Standard soft drinks as well. Many drinks to choose from, all reasonably priced. No alcohol, obviously.Food: Delicious Islamic Indian food. Plain roti is a must but they don't serve it very often or they run out fast. Egg roti is decent but pales in comparison. The chicken curry they serve with it is filling and honestly, you can be happy with just those two dishes. Otherwise, order a murtabak, and a biryani and you'll be very happy.Service: Good, friendly on the outside. They always seem to forget one of my orders, usually a drink. There's a service button on the table
4
Nice breakfast to have here. The murtabak was just delicious. I will not hesitate to have food here again as it is very tasty. Indian curry tasted really nice.
5
Must try for the fish head curry, Mutton a-la carte, mutton Murtakbak, nasi biriyani, cuttlefish and their tea tarik.Best of all, the curry that they give to go with the murtabak is thick.Excellent & will come back again
5
The mutton biryani was fantastically season with melt in your mouth large chunks of mutton all over with just the right dash if gravy!! Perfection!
3
The restaurant is very hyped but the food is not meeting that standard. I went there twice just to make sure that I have tried most of their popular dishes. To state of the food is good but nothing extraordinary.
4
My friend and me went to have a cup of Chai (after our dinner) like they serve in Bombay (now Mumbai). we were sitting on the curbside and talking about old memories.. We didn't get to check out the food menu. may be next visit!!
4
am a home grown singaporean, and when a high school classmate of mine from taiwan returned to visit... and boy, she wanted zam zam! all of us were shocked as it was just out of our expectation! zam zam is a short walk from bugis mrt station, right across the Sultan Mosque. fret not if you are looking for a place to escape from the heat after walking in arab street, zam zam has air conditioned seats (upstairs). they're really good at their murtabaks, down to their curry, its slurping good! compliment it with a teh tarik to complete your meal. and ive since been an avid fan of zam zam for their murtabaks & biryani!however i do note that they heat up the murtabaks in a microwave, this could be due to the high demand/supply issue, to ensure you get a really hot murtabak! (this is the slight disappointment, but its not gonna turn me away!)
5
I have been coming to Singapore for many years now and often passed Zam Zam savouring the lovely smells that emanate from there, promising myself that one day I will go there. Well this year had the day and I was not disappointed. I had the mutton mutrabak and my wife had a vegetarian meal. Both meals were excellent and did not cost the earth. Although Zam Zam had air conditioning upstairs inside we sat outside soaking up the atmosphere of Singapore and looking over to the Sultan Mosque. In total we went three times this holiday and I would recommend Zam Zam to anyone visiting Singapore for an excellent inexpensive meal
4
Been here twice and had chicken murtabak the first time and mutton murtabak and chicken biryani the second time. I liked chicken murtabak better :P It's really good value for money and so good (for my western taste, that is!). I recommend sharing, as portions are huge! Recommended
5
Buzzing with life and orders. Basic eating at it's best. Not a place that you would take your girlfriend on your first date but I would be happy to recommend this place once you have dropped all the pretenses.Have been to this place numerous times in the past and the Murtabak is mouthwatering. Take it easy with the orders as the dishes can be very filling. PRICES - REASONABL
4
Came here again and this time order Chicken and mutton murtabak. This is my 2nd review at tripadvisor. Walking distance from my office and came here for lunch again.hmm.. press the bell and call the staff to re-fill the curry. unfortunately request was not heard. I did find the chicken murtabak to be different with red chicken meat in it. The mutton somehow seem average but I do note that there are quite alot pieces of mutton in the murtabak.Murtabak come with three size and I order the smallest which is $6 Quite crowded during lunch as I see some office and tourist pop by to this stall.Overall a satisfied lunch
3
Seated on 2nd floor. Just a normal coffee shop.. decor minimal..Try the lamb murtabak.. Good Size.. Average taste. Tea tarik okay
5
I visited here since more than 10 years a go... And I always loveee the prata with egg and cheese. The tea tarik so delicious. The other drink that I recommend is Syrup Bandung !!
5
Recommended place for eating,served a goods indian cuisine!
with awesome briayani and chicken curry....must try!
5
Tired chicken biryani and fish biryani during my week's stay in SIngapore...amazing taste...cooked with authentic style....
It fills you up as the quantity huge...I was more happy with the quality and taste
5
This is a local favourite, don't say you went to Singapore if you haven't eat at Zam Zam! Their deer murtabak is a must-try!! Everything else are just great. Never get enough of their food!
5
Okay so its origins might not strictly be Singaporean but whatever the correct name is Singapore Muslim, Muslim or just plain Singaporean the murtabakan is great. Whether its mutton, chicken, beef or one of a dozen curries this is where you will feel as though you are sampling something that belongs in Singapore. The staff being a bit gruff, the paint peeling and almost sitting in the traffic on the sidewalk is all part of the experience and well worth it. Much better than dining at some flash restaurant on Orchard Road surrounded by a hundred other tourists
5
I was there on 15/3 at 16:56. As the store had more varieties on their self, I went in to make my orders and came out waiting the customer service counter for payment. As I gave my nets card to the counter lady, with no smile on her face she ask me how much. I then told her, maam just give a moment and the cook will let you know the price. She immediately gave a unhappy look and say, you don,t know the price, how I know. Alright, but not long she showed her hand sign gesture and said in a very sour tone. Can you wait outside. I was shocked. I have been buying food from Zam Zam since 1987. Even my wedding was held there in 1988. And those days the workers are so polite. Even the counter staff whose an elderly man whom I use to buy at least 7 packets of coffee very polite. I think if Zam Zam continues to employ this kind of rude people, they will loose their customer. From the place where I am working, lots and lots of guests use to eat there. Should Zam Zam educate their staffs on customer service quality would be a benefit in future. I will not buy food from there I see her and will walk away. Food, fantastic. The guy who packs my dinner, very polite. Mutton is always fresh. Even thou, they have 2 to 3 varieties of vege but they are not overcooked or soggy. Briyani rice, not so oily. But the malay lady at their cashier counter, very bad
4
When in Singapore a visit to Zam Zam at the top of Arab Street is a must. One day I will try the curries but just can't go past the murtabak. The dÃ©cor is basic but that doesn't matter...........locals abound which is surely the best recommendation
4
Been here dozens of time. V consistent and hearty Indian Muslim fare. Well know for their murtabaks, biriyani rice and other typical fare. Quite cheap and affordable and at the edge of Arab Street, directly opposite Sultan Mosque. So good place to mosey around before and after the meal. Park a block back at the open field facing the bus queues to Johor. Can always get street parking there and just a block back. Very nice meal. Decent teh tarik too.
5
Three of us shared three dishes, and we walked away satisfied on so many levels - full bellies, happy mouths, wallets not drained. We had mutton murtabak, chicken biryani, and beef bee hoon goreng, plus three soft drinks. The dishes were served with spicy sauces on the side and dressed cucumber slices for cooling. Each dish had a unique flavor profile, and with the spicy sauce on the side, each diner could customize the spice level to their taste, which worked great for everyone. The pastry on the murtabak was especially notable, the perfect texture and heft, and the mutton, which I typically think of as gamey and strong-tasting, was neither - it was tasty without being overpowering. The portion sizes were large enough to satisfy myself and two very hungry young guys. We possibly could have finished a fourth dish, but we didn't want to walk away completely stuffed. Three was just enough. I think our bill was less than $12 SGD each, an amazing price for such great food.There are two levels - the second floor is air conditioned and much larger than the first floor. Service was brusque but efficient, with little waiting time for either taking our order or bringing our food. No napkins of any sort were offered, so bring your own. Take-away is offered, and judging by the constant stream of people going in and out, I imagine a lot of people do take food away, and all of the food would hold up very well if it were to be eaten later.Easy to find, directly across from the Sultan Mosque, just off the corner of Arab Street and North Bridge Road, Zam Zam is not to be missed if you are in Singapore
3
Food was a bit disappointing. Used to be famous for its beriyani rice and murtabak, that was just average.
5
First time in Singapore I found this place the last day and we loved it. Fell in love with the murtabak. Of course it was the first place I went when I came back. Still great murtabak.
3
This is a very basic, no frills style restaurant with menus on the walls, formica tables, melamine and styrofoam dishes. It seems to be popular since it was quite crowded. The food was plentiful but just okay...
4
We came back again here for the tasty Briyani, mutton gravy also one of their best item, it's near Arab street, walking distance from Bugis Junction station
5
I don't usually eat lamb, because I hate the aroma. But here, that rule didn't apply. I ate some and I LOVED it! It was so tender & delicious. Loved the murtabak & briyani rice. The spices were acceptable for us, non-Indian visitors. They open for business at 7 am, so we always have breakfast here instead of at the hotel. The prices were reasonable, we bought the large murtabak for $20, large enough for 4 people
5
Recommended by lonely planet, we sought this place out and it was busy with locals. Our waiter took good care of us and gave advice on how much food we needed. Enjoyed the murtabak, of course, and the fish masala. He also gave us some small curries in which to dip the murtabak. Great food at affordable prices. Will go again :
4
Always count on the mantra "if you see lots of locals at an eatery, that must be a sign of goodness". Indeed, Zam Zam does not disappoint with its murtabak, and briyani. If you visit in the late afternoon where it is cooler, ask for a table outside. You will have the grand Sultan Mosque as your eye appetizer.
3
The taxi driver dropped us here saying they serve a good Indian food. They DO NOT serve typical Indian food, but the Malaysian/Singaporeans dishes might be good as they are heavily crowded always. Murtabak is very good/excellent, but don't expect to get authentic Indian food here. Huzay
4
It's definitely local food you'll find here. I like to bring my friends here when they visit for a taste of Singapore - the murtabak is the best EVER and a MUST EAT. Service isn't the best because they can be SLOW but it's worth the wait. Prices aren't the cheapest but the murtabak is worth the price. It's also across the road from Haji Lane and Sultan Mosque, which are worth a visit if you're around
4
This restaurant is not the cleanest but if you can overlook it, the food is really good!! I'm still craving it as I'm typing this review. My favorite is the Chicken or Lamb Murtabak with their curry. The chicken is a bit spicy but juicy at the same time. I see a lot of people order rice along with their Murtabaks. Unfortunately, they don't serve Roti Prata here unless you come in the morning. One Murtabak sells for around $8 Sing dollars. Very good value meal :) Service is good as well. My dad ordered a Kopi and Indian Tea, both very good. I ordered a Milo, which is also good. I would highly recommend everyone to come and enjoy the authentic food here with friends and family
4
I order Chicken Briyani for SGD 6.5. Beef Briyani for SGD 6.5. Great taste but for me it's a big portion. You can buy it for 2/3 people.
Martabak is so delicious. Crunchy, and I want it more :9
5
Doorman at hotel suggested this rough and ready cafe, if you like spicy and fairly basic decor, this is for you! It was full of characters!
5
I came here twice. !st for the briyani and second for the murtabak. Both meals are unforgettable and spoon licking good.The briyani was a bit cold however but still nice.
3
Its located on Arab Street.
You will find simple economical Halal food. Do try Paratha - Egg and Chicken.
But dont miss Milk Tea.... its my favourite.
Will keep coming each time I visit Singapore.
5
One of the best places to taste briyani while in singapore... Highly recommended. And the location is just perfect...
3
Overall this restaurant have a great range of food. We visited this restaurant on the first day of CNY and still find that this restaurant is almost full. The beef murtabak is great and ice limau is different from common lime juice. The rice biryani is not for everyone, because the herbs is an Indian standard
4
Staying in Singapore and looking for somewhere which was completely different we chose an authentic Malay restaurant. Opposite the Mosque so easy to find Zam Zam is a dry restaurant (no alcohol) full of locals who know a good deal when they se it. Plastic tables and chairs reminded me of the old Balti Houses in Sparkbrook, Birmingham 25 years ago.Slick service without any frills is the order of the day with food which was really good spicy without being too hot and at a price that makes you appreciate the value of what they do. Tables turn quickly, it's a no nonsense place, so booking wasn't necessary and it looked that if there was a wait it wouldn't be for long.Bear now in mind we were staying in Raffles Hotel and you'll appreciate that these places are at completely ends of the spectrum but in terms of delivering experience they are on the same page.Worth a visit if only to be amazed at what is possible on a backpackers budget

This stall is near to my office. I asked my colleague of good indian food during lunch time, he is quick to recommend zam zam. Murtabak is the highlight for this restaurant and pleasantly taste good. They do give a generous portion of food.The price are reasonable and worthwhile. I would recommend it if you like murtabak
5
The food are delicious.. Murtabak is very nice.. And the quantity is huge.. At the price is fairly reasonable.. $6.00 for a murtabak nice for 2.. And the nasi beriyani was delicious.. And its not that hard to find.. A 5 mins walk from bugis mrt.. Recommended for muslim travellers in singapore.. A must visit eatery..

Had lunch here as it was near our hotel so checked in and headed here to hide from the rain shower. It is a small place inside and we were lucky to get a table as it was clearly a popular place.Service was great - swift and attentive.Good arrived quickly and was very tasty. Bargain prices. The mutton biryani was great, and accompanied with a coconut milk sauce for the rice. Might be helpful to have a knife for the meat, but otherwise just get stuck in with fingers! Very good, highly recommended
4
It's one of the several hawker style Indian food places in Kampong Glam, also claims to be the oldest. Generous portions of the briyani and deer murtabak. Price can be considered cheap for Singapore ($30 total bill for two people)
3
Never ever forget to try Murtabak Singapore.
They have many sizes, of course different prices too =).
Range from 4 - 16 SG Dollars.
The one that I try, Murtabak Beef (8 SGdollars for 2 persons).
5
Excellent food, Very nicely cooked delecious Byryani and Chicken Curry. Mix Tea Excellent also. This place nicely located on Arab Street in front of Beautiful Sultan Mosque.
5
Love the atmosphere, the food and the hot sweet tea. Always, service at its best. We never miss a visit. The place has become sophisticated with air conditioning. Still great.

Zam Zam is a foundation in Singapore, Basing on the number of people that were having a meal, and the various cars that stopped by to pick up orders, we had no doubt that it was quite popular with the locals. We ordered the Chicken Murtabak, which was delicious and also the Chicken Biryani, both dishes came with two curry dips with one slightly spicier. It was very satisfying, followed with the curry fish head which was full of flavours, it was one of the best I ever had in Singapore.The place gets full really fast so if you're interested in getting a seat, come in early. The place is not upmarket and gets really crowded and noisy. However, it just adds to the character of the place and does not diminish from the fact that they serve good food. If you not bothered about the deco etc. then definitely check this place out
4
A must visit restaurant whenever I'm in Singapore. The food were tasty and the serving were big too. Worth every single dollar spent. Please try their special murtabak, biryani and their kuey teow goreng, nasi goreng was good too. You may choose from chicken/beef/mutton in your murtabak, koey teow, nasi goreng and biryani
4
Halal restaurant in arab street near Sultan Mosque, one of restaurant you must try as a tourist.Their nasi briani is the favorite menu, but deer murtabak also a must try menu.Lemon tea can accompony you eat those food.Maybe the taste a little bit different from your day to day food, but anyhow as a tourist will be an adventure..Choose the 2nd floor. There are AC.
3
We went here based on tripadvisor reviews. Ordered chicken biryani and murtabak, with tea.The chicken in the biryani was cooked well, though the use of artificial colors in the biryani was off-putting. Maybe the standard is quite high for us, due to the classic indian dum pukht biryani. This was average stuff in comparison. The murtabak was essentially the same chicken, cooked with onions and some spices. The bread was greasy. Tea was great by the way!The food comes cheap, we paid $14.90 overall. Maybe a one time visit but nothing more
4
That's what I'm talking about, Singapore! In an enthusiastic and much-loved cafeteria-style environment you are encouraged to order local favorites off menus in English and pictograms. I would not recommend elaborate deviations as it's not that sort of place nor is English the first language, but value for money; yes! We came for Murtabak, one of our favorite foods, especially for breakfast. It was really nice, and looking over the neighbours curry I had curry envy. By the rate that they were shovelling it in their faces it was acceptable! Afterwards we went to a tourist cafe and paid the same amount for coffee and baklava.Big tip-be there just before noon for lunch. Zoom zoom
5
Nothing beats Singapore street food and this joint can be considered as one. Open from 7am to 11pm daily, regardless of public holiday or not. The mutabaks and the briyanis were delicious. I ordered hot ginger tea tarik and asked for it to be less sweet, which turned out very nice, unlike other places where the 'less sweet' option is still an overkill of sugar. Check them out
5
Probably the best Murtabak Singapore, good Nasi Briyani as well. My only problem here, if you are seated inside the restaurant either upstairs or downstairs, your whole body (and hair) will smell of cooking oil when you leave the restaurant. The ventilation is poor.
4
A must place to visit if you're craving for murtabak singapore. The nasi briani not bad as well.
Limited parking space around but what a fuss, you can drive-thru ;-)
3
The meal was okay not spectacular though. The price was quite high. And the service was slow. The location is very strategic, exactly at the opposite of Sultan Mosque
3
I only had the murtabak here. The murtabak is average here. I liked the sardine the best, the mutton average and the deer murtabak being dry.
5
The service is fast but other than that is non-existant. The decor - well crowded noisy and sits at traffic light. BUT the food -- wow wow wow. Over 15 dyas we ate from there (takeaway) 10 times at least. Never ever disappointed. The chicken and lamb biryani; the lamb Madura, the roti. Served on banana leaf with paper wrapping and tied with string. Unforgettable
4
Zam zam and Victory are the 2 places in Singapore which offer Singapore Murtabak amongst others. They are competitors. Which one is better - it depends on your personal taste. Not much difference between eateries. You can go to both and still enjoy the Singapore Murtabak. They are both institutions in Singapore that have survived the test of time. Your choice.
4
Best murtabak in town, we ordered chicken murtabak and prata with cheese and egg - both are very good. We came there in the morning and served well. The place is quite small as they have their stuff and goods inside restaurant - they have bigger space upstairs
5
I've always frequented this shop whenever I want to eat a murtabak. Their murtabak comes in several versions (chicken, mutton or venison) and several sizes depending on your appetite or the size of your group. Apart from their murtabak, their briyanis are also an excellent option when dining there. They also serve the usual Indian-Muslim stalls such a mee goreng and nasi goreng. The good thing is that if you're driving and are unable to get a parking lot to buy your take away you can just stop in front of the shop and they'll prepare the order and deliver it to your car window like a drive-thru.
4
I used to come here with my parents and siblings more than 20 years ago. So it was almost a walk down memory lane. Their beryani is not what it used to be - just average. But the murtabak is as delicious as ever. Despite the human traffic and multitude of orders, service was fast.
3
Have frequented this place for many years, and the last time was 2 days ago after a break of 1 year. The biryani was just average, either in taste or portion, same goes to the murtabak, Probably my taste buds tricking me because I can see non stop of people walking in
4
I had the same mutton briyani during my childhood, and recently back for the same plate of briyani, and the taste, the meat so tender, juicy and taste the same. I'm impressed. Well Done Zam Zam. Will be back soon.
4
We were heading towards the Mosque when we came across this restaurant and I couldn't resist siting there. The Murtabak was amazing, with two different sauces to add to it... I'd definitely go again. And the waiter was cool!
4
Famous for their beriyanis and murtabak. I am not fond of their beriyanis but their mertabak is delicious!
5
Quite hard to find, but the service is fast and friendly. Air conditioned. The stairs are quite scary because it's quite narrow. The food is delicious!
4
really nice indian and malay malay food.The taste is good and its very busy in this restaurant.We went on friday.
5
The smell of the murtabak you can smell from the opposite road at the mosque. The briyani also was awesome. Go for chicken murtabak. The environment are so so. Come here for eating only and not hanging out.
4
Ate the deer curry and beef murtabak and the flavors were fantastic!! Medium size murtabak easily feeds two people and the sauce with it was delicious. The deer curry was so aromatic and delicious with just the right amount of spices. Service is fast and the wait staff helpful and efficient. The place seems really popular and they were really busy when we went. Lots of people were doing takeout but we had no problem getting a table. Upstairs there is an air-conditioned area and there is some outdoor seating too, although it is too close to the road and traffic
4
They are so famous even they make the murtabak make to stock for take aways! I ordered the briyani and my friend ordered the Murtabak. My verdict: the murtabak was better. So I recommend if you come here just order the Murtabak instead of the briyani
4
Return after >35 years! New premises, delicious food, familiar and as good as I remembered it. Glad they did not change a winning formula, well not by much and allegedly healthier with less ghee, not that I would have noticed. New staff but friendly as in days of yore
4
My first impression of the place was it's cleanliness, which was spotless, always a good sign! I ordered Chicken Beriyani and it was pretty good, bot spectacular, but pretty good.I also ordered a large curry pacific prawn, which was luke warm when served. Apart from that, there was 'Daging Limbu' but that was not hot and tough to eat. I was a little disappointed, but the food charges were cheap
5
Service was fast and courteous which may not be the case for places that are always busy and are already famous for good food. Its a must try if you like simple and honest food
4
The briyani mutton serve with quite big portion, very friendly staff, price is reasonable. Overall experience is good, but expecting more on the taste.
4
Had the murtabak. Definitely a hearty meal due to its size and meat content. Very fast and efficient service. Best to sit upstairs as downstairs can get quite humid.
5
What an awesome little place this is near the Sultan Mosque.I had the traditional ZamZam which was like a huge pancake stuffed with meat and veg served with a dish of Indian sauce. All was recommended by the staff and I couldn't have wished for anything better.The best value meal I had in Singapore.
5
Despite this being Halal do not be put off. No you can't drink beer but this place is worth the visit. I drank Lime Juice and we drank beers right after dinner in the are by the Golden Mosque at Perfetto CafÃ©. The food at Zam Zam excellent a great Mee Goreng(veggie) Chicken Nasi Goreng, Chicken Byrianni and Deer Meat Murtaback. Wow great dinner for three and not expensive. Because we had Byrianni and Murtaback we were invited to go upstairs to the Air conditioned area but I think that was also because we were Tourist
5
Was advised to try Zam Zams as its a good place to get Murtabak and teh tarik, neither of which I had tried before.Really enjoyed both Murtabak and the tea. The restaurant is basic, busy, reasonably priced and a great place to try Murtabak.Accross the road from the sultan mosque and near the city sightseeing bus stop
5
We had the murtabak mutton.My Kenyan buddy loves it.The place might not be so classy but the food is authentic and worth every penny.By the way , brought many to this place for their beryani rice too.The Chinese, Indonesian, American, Swiss they just love this place.If you are ever here in Singapore , do come have a taste of their Murtabak which has been served for more that half a century already
3
looking for something to eat after visiting the Sultan Mosque and Kampong Glam? Even if there is a man trying to invite you to go inside, as it happens in all the tourist restaurants, this is a typical one. People going in and out without stop: people from Singapore, family,friends, tourists. Go to enjoy the food and cold drinks. I went for the Mubarak, on of the most typical dishes. If you only want to try but you do not love that kind of food go for the chiken and not the beef one, which has too much taste/smell. Do not expect nice service or nice place to stay for hours. there are long tables and you share it. Nice way to melt with others :
1
If the bathroom is an indication of the cleanliness of the restaurant, then Zam Zam hits rock bottom. The toilet is simply filthy and in bad condition. This makes me wonder about the restaurant's hygiene and cleanliness. From what I saw and the food handling near the bathroom area, I walked out of the restaurant. This restaurant needs a visit from the health inspectors!
4
Ate here on a Sunday night and they were doing a land office business. Multi-cultural crowd kept up a steady stream for dine in and carry out. Limited menu, but that does not detract from the good food. And what a value! Had the beef murtabak and the fried rice. Both excellent
4
Good price for a good sized of murtabak.
The meat (chicken/mutton) are marinated to perfection.
Yummy!
Con: It can be a little cheaper, I guess (spending up to $14 for murtabak does not sound like the typical hawker-priced food you'd get)
4
We went with locals to have a bit of lunch (they called it a snack) to experience this local tradition. Worth going to and seeing this restaurant started in 1908!
4
The mutton biryani was great. It was tender and juicy. Everything as nicely flavored, not too spicy. The people were nice and the place is no frills. Just good food.
5
very famous muslim food restaurant in Singapore. the murtabak is great and comes in many different sizes. order smaller first and then more if still hungry. Try the Teh Tarek or Teh Halia (with ginger) both indian style pulled tea.
4
I ordered for mutton briyani and I loved it. The meat was tender and well seasoned. It had a large portion but since I was hungry and the taste was delicious, I could finished the whole dish in just a few minutes. I definitely would go back here next time I visit Singapore
4
Come here just to have a quick bites but i forgot It was ramadhan so They only served take away.. Bought murtabak and lamb Bryani. Murtabak is different with the one in Indonesia. Different but Deliciius ... Bryani portion was enough for 2 people.. Love the foo
3
I was taken to this restaurant by a friend but was not overly impressed. Many better places to eat in the area. The waiter had no idea what was going on. However we got another one to sort out the order. I found the food so so. It was certainly popular though people streaming in and out, but personally have eaten better nearby, as I previously mentioned. Cheap enough I suppose.
4
CafÃ© style -Air conditioning upstairs a must for visitors when it's high humidity and 31'C outside Worth a visit if visiting Kampong Glam part of Singapore across the road from the mosque I had the chicken murtabak very tasty and Louise had chicken Nase Goreng Bith both nicely spiced and efficiently serve
4
After a lovely stroll around Kampong Glam we had lunch here in their air conditioned upstairs room. My wife had a delicious sardine murtabak and I had a beautifully tender deer biryani, with a lovely Teh tarikh (less sweet)The service is a little slow, mainly because they were very busy, but it was worth the wait.
4
ZAM ZAM is a very old muslim restaurant near Arab Street - just across from the mosque that serves top notch muslim food. The decor is nothing fancy but the ambience suggests a passage back in time and this is one of the things I really like about it.The quality of the food is excellent and whether or not you are muslim [I am not] you are made to feel welcome. I highly recommend a visit for travellers passing through Singapore that want to experience and take back with them a little of the past. Try the murtabak, or the different curries and of course the lamb biryani which is my favourite. There is no alcohol served but the lime juice is worth a shot until an oasis can be found where you can get a drink
4
Not the cleanest place you will eat in, but it could be one of the tastiest. Very Old place. Try Murtabaq or Biryani <3
The 4 stars is for quality of the place not the quality of food.
3
Nice food but not the ambience. It reminded me like I am at the street of india (market style)...the Briyani was good but not the murtabak (too dried and the filling are popping out)...Portion is big and value for money for hungry bunch
5
The mutton murtabak was amazing, as was the fish briyani! Our taxi driver recommended ZamZam, and we were keen to try it. Can highly recommend it.
3
The Chicken Biryani was good. Not much of oil. But definitely not Dum. Its assembled.But the quality is good. They have other items that look good. Will try them and I will post comments.
4
My friend recommended this restaurant. I never eat Indian food so I didn't quite sure at first. My husband ordered Mie Goreng and I ordered Murtabak. It is similar with Aceh food I guess. It suit our taste just fine.
5
Zam Zam looks 1 star bus food 5
tasty food
friendly service
makes happy with meal even the is traditional none decorated
4
My friends and I came to this place after one of our friend suggested it. It's 10 mins walk from Bugis MRT and located near Sultan Mosque with green Zam zam sign :)We tried the chicken murtabak ($6), beef murtabak ($5) and mutton murtabak ($6) in small sizes because we thought that we can share the food together but we were mistaken, as it turned out their small size is actually twice our usual portion! In the end we had to packed half for take away.Their murtabak is served with indian recipe and curry which makes the flavors rich. They also add some cucumber+tomato sauce if you want to have less seasoning in your food. Overall delicious. Will come to this place again :
4
If you are looking for table-clothes, cutlery on tables, private eating, plush surroundings - turn around. If you are looking for delicious Singaporean food, served quickly at a cheap price - walk right in. Zam Zam would not have enticed me in by a first glance from the outside but having read some reviews it sounded promising and it was only 1 minute walk from my hotel. Shown a plastic table and chair and given the menu, very quickly joined by two locals, if you like privacy not the place. I ordered chicken Marsala, a beef Murtabak & a fresh lime juice. Chicken was served in under 5 minutes with a number of extra dishes that I was not aware of what to do with. The chicken was tender and the sauce spicy. After another 5 minutes the Murtabak arrived - for the uninitiated this is like a naan bread with onions, egg, garlic & beef combined. Dipped into the accompanying curry sauce it was gorgeous. Total cost $10SGD or approximately Â£5 - I will return
4
The two of us walked into a half-filled restaurant (ground floor) at 9 am on a Sunday morning to share a Beef Murtabak (@ S$9.00) and a glass of Teh Halia (@ S$1.20). The two rolls (cut into several pieces each) of beef Murtabak were fresh and crispy. Simply delicious when eaten with the curry gravy and very filling. We were glad that we had not ordered additional items. Will come back to try its Nasi Bryani the next time
5
Excellent recommendation from our taxi driver. Delightful meal, we ordered fish curry, beef mutabak and nasi biryani with Tek Tahrik. Brilliant. All for SD $16.50 Be prepared to share table with the locals who were obviously amused at our bewilderment - the menu is on the wall (pictures), but approved of our choices. Fabulous experience
4
had murtabak and was amazed as to how they tweaked the simple beaten Kerala paratta. Staff was very nice, but he joint was crowded. Had lime juice also ..nice.. biriyani was OK, Also had giant prawns roast. Ok ok food;
4
yummy beef murtabak, price is affordable. briyani here is quite different with the one in Malaysia. worth the try. MRT within walking distance. air-conditioned & clean
5
Very good food ordered the Chicken Murtabak was delicious and also the Chicken Biryani an Indian tea, water and a drink it all came just under Â£10 well worth it, this is no fancy place if you want good food and not bothered about the deco etc then definitely check this place out
2
I arrived around 16.40 hrs today. The staff that stand outside restaurant told me to go upstairs. This floor air conditioning works very well. I order small chicken Murtabak, chicken bariyani and mineral water which total cost was 13.70S$.The bariyani came first. The Chicken wasn't marinade all meat inside was so white. Luckily the curry covered was flavor enough. Rice is my big disappointed. It was so soggy and broke apart not fluffy and long. I only had a few spoon of itLater Murtabak came, It was not what I expected. Bread outside was dried and not crispy like it should be. The Chicken chunks that stuff inside was obviously the same none marinade chicken from bariyani. It made bottom of Murtabak soaking wet. Truly NOT Worth My Trip to go there again. Both Murtabak and Bariyani way below average.
5
The chicken and lamb mutarback are amazing, not need of trying the deer one with such delicacies. The service is nice, but you need to make a reservation or understand that you will have to wait if you go on peak time (if not you can always order to take away)
4
We started our guided tour of Singapore right outside the restaurant. Our guide pointed out that Zam Zam is an institution in Singapore. Basing on the number of people that were having a meal at 9:30 am and the various cars that stopped by to pick up orders, we had no doubt that it was quite popular with the locals. We were able to return later that evening and had the highly recommended deer murtabak among other dishes, I was already bracing myself for the possible gaminess of the meat but was pleasantly surprised. The dough was soft but the meat was slightly crispy and very tasty. It came with two curry dips with one slightly spicier. It was very satisfying.The place gets full really fast so if you're interested in getting a seat, come in early. The place is not fancy and gets really crowded and noisy. However, it just adds to the character of the place and does not detract from the fact that they serve good food
4
Came here for lunch with some business associates. This is one of the well known & oldest Murtabak stall in Singapore. Have been in the same spot since my dad took me here during my younger days. It's really quite an achievement for any eatery. Their Murtabak is crispy on the outside & chewy on the inside, the guys like the savory mutton toppings while the ladies prefer the chicken Murtabak. Fish or chicken curry sauce are served to go with the pancake. They also do served dhal curry but you have to asked for it. One must end this meal with a hot ginger tea for a satisfying meal. Restaurant also served curry fish hea
4
As we were staying at the village hotel and had a flight to catch after Friday salah....we had no time left for a proper lunch....so we rushed to zam zam...and no we were not disappointed.... Don't be bothered by the ever increasing people( it seems the locals really love the food).... We tried the murtabak and trust me its a must have.....avoid the ice tea....it was really a disappointment....
4
According to the publicity, Zam Zam has been serving indian food at very cheap prices for more than 100 years. It's certainly popular, the place was packed when we visited. We ordered chicken biryani and beef murtabak, both were delicious. The service was friendly and efficient, definitely a repeat visit is in order the next time we are in Singapore
5
This is my second visit here, with about 2 years between visits. We went at a weird time, about 4.30 on a weekday, so it was fairly quiet. Regardless we had amazing service, with our lovely waiter checking in on us and refilling our murtabak sauce without asking. We shared a sardine murtabak ($7 size) and couldn't finish it. Food was delicious and our service was great. As it's a Muslim area, it was obviously not licensed. 2 drinks and a large murtabak came to SG$10. Would not hesitate to recommend
3
This restaurant is my favourite place to stopover once a week before heading to work.
I love the egg prata with fish curry.Its texture is so crispy and soft.
They have drive thru services too.
3
The location is so strategic and obviously accessible by MRT - walking distance. The server or waiter approached us but not that well welcome due to busy moment but just be nice and smiley. The food was nice and valued for money. However the service was quite slow and ambience soo noisy. The hand wash area was mixed with the cleaning area for plates and kitchen utensils
4
I had my very first murtabak at Zam Zam years ago and, in my last visit to Singapore, I managed to take a quick visit to this store again. I've had other murtabak's but nothing comes close to their flaky, stretchy pastry. Zam Zam is not fine dining and so service and dining comfort are not always the best so if you are sensitive to the above, I suggest takeaway
4
Staff seemed very disinterested and service was slow and offhand, but the chicken murtabak was AMAZING - crispy, stretchy layers of pancake like dough with a delicious ground chicken, egg, onion and spices filling. We had to order more, itwas so good, even though they are big serves. Prices are pretty cheap, ambience minimal, staff grumpy, but it us definitely worth a visi
4
The food here is excellent and very good value for money. Seems a bit crazy from the outside but it is very well organised. We had beef muhktaba (? Not sure that is right) - ordered a medium but small would have been enough and the chicken biriani which came with delicious sauces also we bought a veg curry. $15 for all of it and it was too much for 2.
4
When you are visiting the area around the Sultan Ismail Mosque and Kampong Glam, in Singapore, be sure to drop in at Zam Zam restaurnt on North Bridge Road for a variety of taste treats.My favourite is the Mutton Murtabak, ( a fried bread filled with seasoned minced mutton)which is served with a curry gravy, and can be accompanied by any of the freshly cooked curries available daily. For rice lovers there are a variety of Briyani, chicken , mutton , beef or seafood.We ate heartily and the bill came to $30 for two people ! The friendly staff made the delicioys food in a coffee-shop style restaurant , a very pleasant experience.One can also order the good to takeaway, perfect picnic fare, Singapore style
1
Two days ago, my hubby and I happen to be in Arab street. As I'm a Singaporean, 20yrs ago we used to patronize this restaurant frequently for its yummy briyanis and murtabaks. Most occasions you'll get to see ZAM ZAM foods being catered in weddings and other functions. So excitedly we ordered e chicken BRIYANI and mutton murtabak. To our shock, the rice n masalas had no link! The inferior Basmathi rice was yellow and had no taste. Simply bland. The chicken masalas were not coated into e rice. Tough chicken piece cooked in some bland paste (def not in rich cashew nut & BRIYANI masala paste at all)! Looked around the shop and only saw tourists and some Chinese seated! Hmm...standard has dropped so drastically so pls try elsewhere. Murtabak was average too! Price was ok. Perhaps they cater this quality to the price they charge! Disappointing though!!
3
When we went it was a very hot day and it was nice to get inside for a meal and air con. When we got in the ambience of the restaurant was sort of poor, with chips on the walls and the menus high up on them. The tables and chairs looked like they were from a family BBQ, plastic and not well cleaned. The employees looked very grumpy, and we didn't get served until quite late. One of us got up multiple times too see if we could order up front but the staff just told us that someone would come and take our order. When we did get our order taken it took quite a while to get just the drinks out, and they forgot one of them. When we did get our food though, it was absolutely delicious. By FAR one of the best meals I had had that whole holiday. The value is also really good too, we had the beef and chicken murtabak which was only $8 for a big plate. It was so good, we had to buy another 2. The only reason I would not give this place 4 stars is because of the very slow service and ambience
4
if you like muslime food, you can not avoid Zam Zam, was there back in 1999's and back again nw, besidesthe guys using handhelds nowadays to note the order, rather then paperand pencil, the food is still excellent. go there and have some Roti, Prata and The Tarik, you will not regret and still have coins in your pocket for drinks oposite in Haji Lan
5
Zam Zam was on our itinerary from the beginning due to great reviews about this place. After a tiring visit to Universal Studios & Aquarium, we headed to Kampong Glam district, where Zam Zam is located. This restaurant is packed on most days. It took us 5-10 minutes to get a table.We tried the venison Murtabak and I must say, the taste was absolutely fantastic. The gravy given along with it was so so great.I also tried Biryani and that was also amazing.This place has everything right from the unique taste to perfect pricing & excellent service. This place is a must visit when you are in Singapore.Thank you Zam Zam for one unforgettable experience. You guys are best at what you do. Keep serving the great food for many many years
4
I love the cheese prata, murtabak and briyani. Simple food, great value , absolutely no services at all. The tastes are very good though. Comfort food in Singapore is fading, but not this little place. They serve breakfast as well.
5
amazingly good food. It is quick, functional food, but goodness it is tasty. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality and flavour.
4
Very freindly waiters, good food we had the lamb biryani together with the chicken Muktabah. very tasty. All sorts of fruit drinks were available - freshly squeezed.
The restaurant is just next to the Mosque at the end of Arab street
4
Still the best place to go when i have murtabak crave. At times, service might be a little slow due to the crowd. But it is definitely worth waiting for. Beware when you decide to go during lunch time (12-2pm). Waiting time might be up to an hour
4
The mutton murtabak is wonderful! Crispy and well cooked. Enough meat and spices. Many locals as well as tourists can be seen eating the variety of food there. I find the chicken murtabak a lil too wet, not crispy to my liking. This visit is not my first actually. Have been here countless times since childhood
2
The briyani was perfect and their quality of serving the briyani has been consistent over the years. However, the staff shortage is an issue. As two guys had to run around serving the top floor. We had a bad encounter with one of the guys named, Farhan. He was very rude to us. They took ages to serve us a plate of briyani and when it finally came to our table there were no utensils given and he just went to sit at a corner and chatting with his colleague. When we called him to get utensils he took sometime again. We decided to get the utensils our own by approaching another staff that was near the utensils section. Farhan expressed frustration and shouted at me infront of the customers who were all busy eating. Then, he threw the plates to show his anger infront of everyone. This is very uncalled for and the manager should definitely look into this. Despite this, we ended up paying for the food, Very very disappointing service. They should do something about the service if they want to keep their standards. This will be our last time coming to Zam Zam
5
If you want to try the local food in a local cafe this one is for you. Don't expect anything posh cos this is not this type of place but the food is fantastic. It was so good we went twice. The chicken murtabak is the meal everyone should try, dammed fantastic is all I can say. I did try the mutton but it was a tad too dry for me. Also tried the papadams and they were very tasty, don't taste the same as we get here in Australia as ours seem not as good. I highly recommend this place

I always have a hard time deciding whether I come back here again and again for the briyani or the murtabaks. I guess I have to say now it is the murtabaks, which are second to none in Singapore, as a recent dine-in experience showed (somehow the dish doesn't travel well in takeouts as the fried dough gets a bit rubbery). I also tried many of the other dishes (liver curry, etc) which I leave for the die-hard fans of such dishes.
4
The restaurant was a frenzied place with people having meals, take-aways and food being brought out from the busy kitchen. I absolutely love their murtabak with all sorts of fillings from chicken to lamb to venison. So goood! Zam Zam Restaurant is where the famous Murtabak Singapore comes from. Their iced coffee is also great! Absolute must try when in Singapore. Has that old charm about it and unpretencious.
5
Cannot go wrong with ZamZam, ever! This place is an institution in Singapore and the upstairs parlor brings to mind old "union hall" eateries of 1930's-60's Paris. Simply put, this is local "comfort food" at super reasonable prices. Great value for dollar, and I think the Murtabak is unequalled. It's open early and stays open late, serving a mostly local population of foodies. Easy to get to, solid service, consistently tasty food, and really a destination point for all. I'm actually quite surprised every tourist book doesn't have ZamZam front and center, but we're all lucky this is the case; otherwise, it'd be chockers and not inexpensive!I only wish they'd sell me one of their super cool, embroidered wait staff shirts! Maybe next time..
5
Quite simply some of the best tasting food on the planet. Who needs cute tables and ambience? ZamZam has FOOD like you have never eaten before. Have Chicken Murtabak and iced Kopi and don't look back.
5
Food is good everytime i have meals over there. Very cheap and delicious food on the menu. Everytime i will have murtabak as they made good ones over there. Should try there.
4
Beef Briyari and Mutton murtabak are delicious.
Ice Teh tarik is tea with milk smell good
Some staff are not friendly.
4
Great Murtabak, and Biryani, situated at the Corner of Arab street, opp Masjid. Good delicious food, not forgeting to mention the Arabian tea which they serve
4
Murtabak & Mutton Beriani were the best. The staff were helpfull and grab your order as fast as they can. It was busy hour but they still serve their best
4
Highly recommended their murtabak and briyani variety. Reasonable prices. They serves mamak-style western food here too.
Walking distance to Arab street and Masjid sultan.
4
The taste is so good...!!! but once you come out from the restaurant, you'll smell like the all the food served inside..:)
5
I always look forward to my Zam Zam curry fix every time I am in Singapore. The food is awesome and all the rest is to be ignored. Service is friendly, it's always busy and bustling with activity. A wonderful little hole in the wall that sets the bar for excellent inexpensive Indian food
5
The Indian restaurant on North Bridge road, is a fantastic little gem. It's a neighborhood restaurant with great atmosphere, fantastic service and authentic food. We have been several time and never have been disappointed. The menu is quite extensive and the special change very regularly. Highly recommended

Went with a friend to pig out. Ordered a chicken briyani , mutton murtabak and a veg (it was long beans curry that day). The briyani and curry came lukewarm. The veg was cold. The taste was quite good. But would have preferred it piping hot. The murtabak was freshly cooked and hot. It was tasty. We ordered 2 ginger milk teas. They were lukewarm too , thin and too sugary. But in all, this whole table of food only cost $17. We were very full and it was value for money. Unfortunately, my friend had diarrhea after eating this meal and I had a few runs to the toilet too. We don't know if it's due to the food, other things or Our reaction to the spices. So we are giving it the benefit of doubt. In general it's an authentic taste which is quite value. Recommended!Not much atmosphere though...and crammed dining experience.
4
Great food service! Yummy and delicious foods. Situated just a walking distance from the hotel where the family stayed. 👌
5
Briyani rice and special Murtabak is must try dishes! Fast n friendly services... And all comes with Reasonable price... Excellent! Will comeback here soon.
4
Make sure you order Briyani and chicken murtabak. If you do come next time, you may order anything else
4
This is not my first time to eat nasi briyani but in this restaurant is different, with S$6 you have large menu (for indonesian is enough for two persons). I decided this is number 1 halal resto in Singapore.
3
Huge murtabak eventhough small size. Requested cheese but only being given 1 cheese and if would like more, have to add SGD1 per cheese.
4
Love the chicken briyani and murtabak. My 6 year old daughter loves it!! A must try during your journey Singapore.
4
Just up from Arab Street, this is the place to go for Murtabak - crispy pastry filled with your choice of meat. We had the mutton version and it was delicious. A medium serving with huge and is enough for two people. Other items on the menu looked great as did the meals being served up to other partrons.If you are serious about eating your way across Singapore then you need to put Zam Zam on your agenda
3
went here while going to Arab street, Harji lanethis place is not big on the customer service but big on foodits very popular and is busy we got shown to a table upstairs this place is full of character creaking staircase, the sounds and the smells make this place worth whilewe had the medium Mutton Murtabak it was great we didnt thing we would finish but we did a great way to rest and recharge before doing more walking Recommend that this place is worth a try while in Singapor
3
This place is near Kampong Glam and Haji Lane. Zam Zam has plenty of seating on the second floor, spartan but fully airconditioned, which is a life saver on a very hot afternoon. The waiters are very welcoming but once seated, we have to wait for quite a while for our orders to be taken.We ordered 2 murtabak ( ground beef and ground mutton ) with drinks at a reasonable price of $14. Food portion is generous and freshly made but the star of the meal is the curry that goes with the lack lustre murtabak.It is best to come by MRT ( Bugis Station ) because parking can be a major headache
4
Came here for breakfast on May 3rd. People came and go as we're dealing with their Murtabak and Nasi Biryani. The size of Murtabak is good for 2-3 person. Me and boyfriend had 1 Murtabak, 2 Nasi Biryani and 2 Teh Tarik. Will definitely come back here since the price is so cheap and the food was so good and very fulfilling.
3
Biryani and murtabak - These are the two dishes this place is famous for. They are good but if you are coming from India, you must have eaten tonnes of good biryani, so you will find it average. Overall good place to eat.
5
Affordable and delicious food. Should try murtabak and briyani here! There are a lot of choice (Chicken, mutton, beef)
4
I grabbed breakfast there - strong sweet coffee and an interesting mix for breakfast (have no idea what it was but it was good)
5
We ate here twice and kinda tried everything in their menu. Murtabak and Briyani were our favorites but the fish curry is good as well. Actually everything's delicious.
Tip: you can ask them to make the food less spicy.
3
Food was typical and good (mutton murtabak) but do not think about "haute cuisine", we are here talking about a popular restaurant with rough but efficient service and plain food.
4
Love the food, almost all the menu are great and delish. The chicken briyani (S$ 6.5) and martabak (S$ 8 you could share it with three people) are very good and the nasi goreng putih also good too. For breakfast you might choose the prata and my preference was cheese prata. Except prata all the food are in quite large size.
4
We went here on a recommendation from a local as we wanted to eat in a non touristy place and traditional dishes from singapore. It was exactly that, authentic, clean but rough round the edges friendly servers and so blooming cheap we could have stayed all day and just eaten everything on the menu. The kids had egg fried rice with chicken and woofed it down. I had a beef Murtabak and couldn't get enough! Hubby had Chicken Biryani. Tons of food for Â£13 (26sgd) Fab
4
we had the beef and lamb briyani and it was very good meat was tender and portions are big, also had a chicken martabak between us and still couldn't finish it all. Dont expect good service or a smile but the food is worth a one off try, try and go before 12pm as it gets very busy, there is AC upstairs. I'd suggest order 1 briyani and 1 martabak and share between 2.
2
Tried chicken briyani, n my hubby n relatives tried beef briyani and other menu i forget. The chicken was huge and the beef was tough. I ate indian food couple of times before, and this is the first i couldn't finished it. Maybe i should order chicken masala. But the place was crowded, and it's kinda famous. Not really friendly waiter though
5
This gets five stars for what it is, a local Indian shop, not all five stars are the same; this is cheap tasty and casual five star.This is where I was first introduced to Murtabak and it has spoiled all others to follow. This is an Indian Muslim restaurant that specializes in Murtabak and Biryani, and it does both well, although it makes it's name with the Murtabak. Their Murtabak is fantastic, cooked just crispy enough, stuffed with egg, onion, and garlic; but it isn't too greasy. You can get it filled with Chicken, Mutton, Beef, Deer or Sardine and also vegetarian; I recommend the chicken. It is served with a tasty, slightly spicy curry that is great for dipping. They also serve other typical mamak shop foods such as nasi goreng and mee goreng, both made in the bright red Malay style. All the food come out great, but beware, eat this for lunch and you will have a tough time staying awake in the afternoon as it is heavy and tasty
5
went there for lunch and dinner.. price are good.. big portion.. good service.. very fast..
its provide delivery too..
this is a compulsory place for you to eat when you visit singapore
4
We go to this place first on arriving in Singapore.
The curries are OK, but the murtabak is outstanding and portions are generous.. We recommend the mutton, the venison is not worth the extra.
4
Always head here for supper if I am around the area. Cheap Indian food. Their speciality are the murtabak and nasi briyani
4
we had the Chicken and Mutton Murtaback, two between three and we could not finish it all, it was very nice and good quick service even though it was busy, upstairs inside is air conditioned. we will go back for lunch some time
4
This is a street restaurant with no thrills. The food is v cheap though they have a varied offering. Its not the place to take business people, but more for the urban explorer, as you need to be prepared to eat with your hands, good food though and better experience
3
In a city so expensive as Singapore is good to reach a place like this, a good restaurant where you can enjoy of the Muslim food. Let's go and enjoy one of the specialities the pancakes with beef or chicken with a coke and a very aforedable price of no more than 7,5 Singapore $
3
Based on the recommendation in the Lonely Planet we stopped at Zam Zam to try the pancakes, or murtabaks, as they call them. Restaurant was full of locals, which is usually a good sign that the food is good. We ordered lamb murtabaks and they were very good. They are quite big, we ordered two medium portions which was too much. Worth a stop when strolling through Kampong Glam.
4
We were staying near the Arab area and after a long flight we didn't want to spend time sitting in a restaurant. As we walked past Zam Zam the tout grabbed our attention and the place looked clean and we could see the food being prepared by a man outside the window working through the window. We ordered a quick meal and ate it on the street table while watching the tout do his work. They were very busy with traffic pulling up and ordering take away. The Singapore version of McDonalds? I had Goreng and it was very tasty and very spicy
4
We were passing by and I noticed the place from reading previous reviews. Ordered the mutton murtabak and biryani.My husband enjoyed the biyani and the mutton murtabak was excellent. The lime juice was refreshing in the heat.Busy popular place.Watch the murtabak being made in the front
4
We were in the Arab area of singapore and did not like the look of the touristy restaurants when the touts from Singapore Zam Zam drew attention to the baker who was rolling out Murtabak on the front. That and the draw of Air conditioning got us upstairs and dinning on okra and mutton Murtabak . They were stuffed with ground lamb and egg. Delicious and pretty sure that sauce they serve it with is the fish head curry. Cheap delicious treat. Have the lime juice which is refreshing. They do a lot of pickup orders and now I know why. Went back a few times while I was in Singapore.
5
A must visit spot for me !
The Martabak are the best in Singapore so far.
Their Briyani is excellent although some may like different type of briyani.
Price is very reasonable.
Service is fast and excellent.
3
I preferred the sardine murtabak over the chicken. The curry is quite thick. Had the chicken and the fish curry but preferred the fish curry over the chicken.
5
The murtabak is PHENOMENAL!!!! (Chicken one is best) the service was good the 2 times I'd been there, you just have to signal to someone when you are ready or need something!! Awesome place
5
Had some lunch here between sight seeing. Great spot to have mutarbak and briyani with the locals! Delicious and fast food. Lunch for 2 plus drinks for less than $15.
5
Now, there's a lot of confusion as to which Zam Zam is being referred to here, as apparently many other restaurants have opened up claiming to be the original Zam Zam.Here's the tip on how to find the REAL AUTHENTIC Zam Zam:It's located right opposite the majestic mosque around Arab Street, at the corner facing a traffic light!Personal choices: Briyani Mutton/Chicken, Murtabak Mutton and Ice Syrup Bandung - you won't go wrong and will just keep coming back like I did
3
We tried the lamb and beef murtabak in the small serving, one of them wouldve been sufficient for my young daughter and myself. The lamb was the favourite! We found the serving staff rude, which was a shame. Wesat in the air conditioned 2nd floor, but it was still rather warm
5
The establishment is basic in terms of decor, but there's a reason Zam Zam is always packed with locals and tourists alike. The murtabak is excellent. Some of the best we've ever tasted and we've tasted quite a few. We selected 2 mediums, one deer meat and one chicken, for 3 people thinking we would have left overs. Hahaha. Leftovers. Not a bite was left. We preferred the chicken over the deer, even though both were delicious. We loved the sauce that accompanied them as well. The lime soda was not the typical Indian lime soda (salty/sweet). It's more like lime juice. Not a problem, just don't confuse the two of them like I did. The staff was courteous and hardworking. Service was speedy. Enjoy
2
Never thot that i'd be the one saying this..pls improve your serving staff..we saw just now that your staff clean the table even when the customer still trying to finish her drink.. reason being..'incoming customers'...pity them.. take note also on our take away order.. came all the way from johor to take away 'beriani rice'..end up having ..'white rice'..while paying for the beriani..pity us..Please improve.t
2
Well, I used to say Zam Zam was one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore - for all the reasons nicely detailed in the favorable reviews. But I was very disappointed today. I came for my regular dishes of the basics (Murtabak, Briyani - oh, you spell it) - but this time around, I had a major wait to be served, and then, was told there was no Murtabak today. That's like saying there is no rice in a Chinese restaurant, or almost like saying there is no tomato sauce in an Italian restaurant. Not only that, they just didn't seem to care. So, despite my five or six fantastic dining experiences here, I have to add on to the reviews which say poor service - because I sure got it today. I then went next door to Victory - much better service, and food was probably about the same. So, somehow Zam Zam has become a touristy and local favorite while Victory gets a silver medal. Next time around, will check out them both, and go to the one with the fewest in the restaurant to increase chance at decent service

Me and my partner went for a day trip to Spore on Dec 18th. I have made arrangements on where to eat list in Spore. We are food lovers. After reading reviews about this restaurant, good and bad reviews, we insist of going to give a go. We were lost at the beginning and went circles around Bugis area, asking around we were given wrong directions. At last, we found Zam Zam Restaurant across the street. We arrived before lunch hour, 11-ish. Okay, let us be honest, to our surprise, from the reviews we read was completely different from what we expected!Service order was quick and efficient! We order Chicken Briyani Rice and Beef Murtabak. The portions can fed 2-3 people especially murtabak. Just so you know for murtabak, there's different price range starting SG$5. We had Beef Murtabak, SG$7. The food serves on our table after 15 minutes. It was served hot and crispy! Chicken Briyani Rice was absolutely delicious! The chicken was cooked perfectly well! As for Beef Murtabak, compare to any murtabak we've tried, it's a winner! The meat was a lot, the dough was crispy and not oily. Their curry and dhal was served together for both food, and it taste really nice too! What a surprise! That's a good brunch for us both to start our day in Spore! Happy satisfied customer and we will come back again for more Briyani and Murtabak
4
Delicious murtabak. The taste of mutton and meat murtabak is very nice.
Price of foods and drinks are reasonable here. Service is good.
1
Do not cater for vegetarians. Toilet was disgustingly dirty with a door that does not close propely and cockroaches in the basin sink. Staff were too busy to even yake the time to clean thr table before seating new customers.
4
I am not an Indian nor a Muslim, so if you asked me how traditionally perfect the foods here are, I wont be much helpful.But if you ask me if I enjoy what I ordered today? I would say "I did, why dont u try if u haven't? :)"I read ppl's review and found out their famous dishes are Murtabak and Biryani. I ordered mutton Biryani and chicken Murtabak with iced Teh Tark. The Biryani was nice when mixed with the thick curry sauce, the mutton was tender and tasty.We destroyed it in no time.. And the murtabak was really the highlight crispy rotti bread with marinates vegetables, onion and eggs really hit the spot.. The crunch vegetables add up the texture and the combination with the sauce was addictive. :) We paid $15 all together. Not bad hey
1
I feel that the food is over-rated at best. It may have been fantastic once upon a time, but those times have clearly passed. Service was really bad and waiters were so rude, I left without eating. The rest of my group brought some food for me after, but it wasn't all it's made out to be
4
Keralese Muslims operate this restaurant said to have been established in 1908. The food has Arabic (Mutabbaq - folded) stuffed pancake, origins in S Arabia & Yemen that seafarers brought to Asian coasts; and S. Asian (Biryani) rice dish made with spices and meat or vegetables; besides the local fish-head curry and other dishes. Singapore has a diverse and rich multicultural heritage. Depending on the origins of the food and the people serving, the ingredients can vary significantly. We enjoyed the food as we stayed with the classics named above at Zam Zam
4
Zam Zam is one of those restaurants that has gone down in the hall of fame. After all how many restaurants can claim to be still standing over 100 years after first being opened. Of course this establishment must be doing something right to still be here after huge rises in rent in fast developing Singapore.Now this is not the place to have a romantic meal or a business meeting. It is the kind of place you come for a very informal friends or family get together to just get down to the business of eating. And when it comes to food there are two classics that Zam Zam excels in, Biriyani and Murtabak. If you stick to these two options it will be pretty hard to be disappointed. So the next time you find yourself in Kampong Glam and have a craving for one of these dishes be sure to make a visit to Zam Zam
2
The bryani dry without much flavor, the mourtaback certainly not what it used to be !!!Renewed service with mobil gadges but certainly not improved!Maybe the head chef changes, in any case, it certainly was "not" as I wrote in my previous review "top" !!!!I'l give it a poor SIX! Sorry, i liked the restaurant!!!
4
Recommended by a friend, I tried the murtabak. It was really delicious! The briyani was not so bad too. Service was quite slow. Got the murtabak and briyani rice first, the drinks arrived about 10 minutes later. Hope they can improve the service to customers since a lot of people likes to go there
1
Don't go there on weekends as their service staff are so rude and don't even give two hoots when to try to get their attention to take our orders . We waited over 10 minutes and no attended to us even when we flagged to service staff they just ignored. So we walked out and Brought our business somewhere else ! Don't go if you have other choices .
4
Been here so many times. My friends swear by the biryani. I'm not really a fan of rice so I went in for their chicken/mutton chop or murtabak. Taste wise, it's worth a visit. Always see tourists dining here as well. Service can be a little slow when it's full house. Worth the wait I guess :
5
Always good. Lovely biryani and chicken kurma. Murtaba too. And cheap! Always worth a pitstop. Portions are huge.
4
Try Murtabak and dont forget to order teh tarik .......................... the location is near Sultan Mosque
4
Zam Zam Salabim, is all I can say. This restaurant is truly enchanting, as it offers amazing halal Indian breakfast. It may look simple, but it tastes fantastic.We order different pancakes (with cheese, onions and lamb stuffed), which correctly are called Prata here. They actually rather remind me of puff pastry than pancakes. Anyway, the way of eating Pratas: you rip off a piece of them and dip it into tasty veggie, fish or meat curry sauce. What a heavenly mess!In addition to the Pratas, the Biryani is the signature dish of Zam Zam. The main component of these dishes is flavored rice. It will come with spicy roasted meat. You can also order a vegetarian version, of course. The rice is roasted with a good amount of onions, chilies and nut. Sometimes they will add a few raisins. Biryani is often served with yogurt and mango chutney
4
it just kinda seems fitting to have a murtabak and briyani meal when the muslim heritage site is so near. given the ample affordable indian muslim food choices in singapore food courts and hawker centres, this place still stands out because it is generous with portions, has an upper air-conditioned sitting area, and sells deer meat murtabak. i haven't seen that anywhere else in singapore
4
If you want a murtabak in Singapore, Zam Zams is the place to go. For many years, the food here has been consistently good and still is today. Sure, it's rough and ready by some standards but that all adds up to the occasion. If a foreigner, almost certainly you will be sat upstairs in the slightly more couth, less crowded area which is worthwhile, it can get very hot. Already looking forward to our next visit
5
Zam Zam is kind of a landmark in the Arab Street area of Singapore. They have the BEST murtabek anywhere! I have been there so many times that they knew my name and always looked after me. The curry is outstanding. I always ask for extra because it's so good eating with the murtabek. The restaurant is easy to find. It sits on the corner across from Sultan Mosque and Golden Landmark Hotel. You must try this place. It is a true Singaporean food
4
I stayed across the road at the Village Hotel Bugis and after seeing the lines to Zam Zam knew it must be a hit. It did not disappoint! So good - I had it twice during my stay in Singapore. The biriyani is not to be missed as well as the chicken and mutton 'mutabark'.Awesome
5
Second time to Singapore, second time to Zam Zam Restaurant. Ordered chicken briyani for first time. I like it because not too spicy with spice and herbs. Order small beef murtabak unfortunately did not reach my standard. We have to stick for S$8.00 and above. Second day we came back again. This time I ate beef briyani. The beef was so delicious and tender and moist! We ate murtabak again and this time we order S$8.00. Marvelleous! We also take away beef murtabak S$11.00 for two, beef murtabak S$8.00 for two and chicken murtabak $8.00 for two. We can be more crazy if we still have lots of S$ inside our purse
2
We ordered chicken murtabak n mutton briyani. Service was prompt on a weekday late afternoon. Staff were generally friendly and welcoming. However, don't expect a very high standard of hygiene. Like the others have said, this is a rather informal cafe. The price was reasonable, we spent $18 for 2pax. The meal was too spicy for us.
4
Zam Zam is something of an institution in Singapore's Indian dining scene - and there is certainly a good reason for that. We recently ordered their chicken briyani (the Straits version - as opposed to Indian "biryani" where the rice and the meat are cooked together). It was quite supple with fresh, tender chicken and aromatic rice. As "briyanis" go, this is about as good as it gets! The chicken murtabak was quite outstanding too
4
No pretentiousness. We had great murtabak (chicken and mutton). While both were great, the mutton was a winner. Air conditioning up stairs. Been there forever doing the same thing.
3
Although it is a full house, the murtabak wasn't as tasty as those they serve 30 years ago! Same goes for the nasi briani.
3
If you visit Arab Street, do visit Zam Zam for Murtabak. They also gave deer Murtabak. If you need to cool down proceed to the 2nd floor and enjoy the AC as you eat.
4
Back for my prata and curry, the mee goreng was great as usual. The noisy busy vibe during peak house adds to the charm of the shop.
4
I came originally from the middle east and had a lot of Indian friends which made me try their dishes. Zam-Zam offers authentic Indian taste in an oriental country that is right for the budget!!
5
A friend lent us Frommer's Singapore day by day guide book. We checked out the Kampong Glam walk which was well worth the wander. It recommends Singapore Zam Zam to eat. So when in Rome so to speak we tried Zam Zam's and were very very pleased with the choice and recommendation. The murtabak, we tried the deer (Rusa) was fabulous and the mutton biriyani was very good. So often guide books disappoint and their recommendations are a let down but in this case we found authentic location, fabulous surrounding and great food. Would definitely recommends this place and hope to return
3
I went in here for a snack yesterday and had the chicken biriani with a side dish of curried beans. The restaurant was full, so I assume that it must have some really good dishes if you know what to order. My dinner was fine though not brilliant, but very morish (you want to eat more and more)as it was not over spiced, and the iced coffee I had with it is the best I have had anywhere. Not had anything quite like it before - the coffee was very strong, served in a huge glass with lots of ice, and sweetened with condensed milk. I could have drunk 10 of them. It is opposite the mosque near Arab Street, and though not brilliant, a good place to go into for a quick informal snack. If someone who knows it could recommend their best dishes ( I heard the Murtabak is good), I would certainly go back to try them, especially so as I liked the informal atmosphere of the restaurant
4
A random walk in to the 'restaurant' proved its value. The pricing is cheap considering its in the town area. I ordered a mee goreng ($4) and a teh ice ($1.50). I then realised they actually offer deer meat! Like what other reviewers mentioned. I should probably try the murtabak on my next visit. A noodle lover, i've tried many mee gorengs. But by far. This is one of the acceptables ones. Its not magnificent. But its slightly above average. Nothing is worse than a plate of tasteless platter yea?Oh and yes. Sharing of table is a norm here. The guy got me to sit with a complete stranger. But no awkwardness though. Just smiles. Guess this is the culture here. Its hot and stuffy. But the fan did some justice.Overall if you can take hygiene, stuffiness or even the table sharing culture, its worth a try
4
Their nasi briyani is nice but way too much for a petite lady like me. The ayam goreng is so deslih and that is the reason I always took 2 and quite expensive. Well, these days, you can't find cheap cheap food. Their chicken curry or mutton is nice too. Thumbs up for them
4
When I lived in Singapore in 1970/71 I used to take my family to this eating house. The children loved it and the staff loved having us. I recently went back to North Bridge Rd and the placeis still there. It is right opposite the Mosque and it is basically a muslim eatery. The shop has been upgrade since 1971 but the food is as good as ever. If you want a good feed order a murtabah and a bowl of gravy. There are other dishes but I found this very pleasing to the Aussie taste. Go there and enjo
5
I love the food, all of it, FULLSTOP. From the rice to murtabak, everything had a great taste. Even my toddler enjoys it too..the hospitality of the workers. Easily access just by the road.
5
We tried murtabek here for the first time and loved it. The flavours were amazing and the staff were very friendly too. I would recommend zam zam for their murtabek- it was delicious.
3
Convenient place to head to with friends when it's late and most other restaurants have closed.. Food was not bad though they should seriously consider doing some renovations to make the environment look more pleasant!
5
The taste is great! Delicious! I ordered the curry chickren set is great! The Iced Chocolate is really really good.
4
i ordered fried rice, murtabak and es teh tarik. they have big portion and spicy food. i saw many people came and some take away. the food is good price is not expensive. worth to try
4
There's no John Travolta and hardly any Olivia Newton John here. If you are lucky, you can grab a roti john, thoughThat said, GREASE is the word! Indeed, it is!It is found swimming on the roti prata and murtabak... and traces grace the floor for sure. Food is good.. once you get past the cleanliness, tidiness and hygiene concerns.The seating is messier than the service. The diner is hot and stuffy. The prata man does his thing with his shirt unbuttoned at the top. You won't get things any better!Expect to dine with strangers as THEY share your table! The decor is spartan. The tables barely but thankfully there. Order the mee goreng, murtabak, prata... they won't disappoint. There's deer available too.Grab N Gobble. You won't regret it. But you'd wonder why you did it - after doing it
4
Try SGD32 for a meal for four to start with. Add wonderful Murtabak, chicken or mutton, sBeef, rice and trimmings and you're right on. Zam Zam began in 1908! Right there in Arab Street and all the atmosphere of little India but with a brilliant mosque ( can't visit after 4 so check the opening hours) and lots of bazaar type shops. Bustle. Bustle. All makes for a complete experience unique to that area of Singapore. Don't worry about the pink plastic chairs, just enjoy the service, the customers and the food. Try the lime drink. Super tiny limes in an iced drink.All great. Then go again

This review is based on my opinion as my husband would definitely give it 5 stars as he loved the food.We sat upstairs of the restaurant, there are few chairs downstairs but many many more upstairs. Very basic tables and basic plastic chairs. The restaurant was not full upstairs and there were 3 waiters standing around texting on their mobiles. We sat for a while and then had to wave for one to come to ask what we wanted. My husband ordered mutton murtabak and I ordered a beef one. It didn't take long for the food to arrive. We had a plate of food each and some very nice spicy sauce to share. My plate was the $5 potion which was still too big for me to eat in one setting. I have to say murtabak is like a roti bread stuffed with minced meat and onions. I personally didn't like the mince too much and ate the bread minus the filling with the spicy sauce...without the sauce the food would be very bland.My husband absolutely loved it so obviously different people different opinions. Up to you if you want to try it

The place is a bit crowded and old, but the waiter is quite attentive as he quickly went to us to take order once we were seated. We waited a while to be seated as it was full with customers. In my opinion, it was little bit pricey but since they serves food in big portion, we managed to share the tab with each other. Some foods come in three sizes, so make sure you make good choice.Recommended foods: Murtabak Singapore (we went for chicken) & Briyani (we took chicken & lamb). The portion is huge and it taste good. Please be reminded, they only accept cash. Will definitely come back again. We did leave with happy tummy

If you are in a group, please just order the Murtabak. It is so crispy and the size can be as big as a large pizza. The staffs are friendly and the food came quite quick I would say. Plus it is halal so shouldn't be a problem for Muslim tourists. Also they are a mosque nearby so you can pray after your meal
4
The place and enviroment are okay. Food is good but a bit spicey. A lot of tourist go to this place. Murtabak quite dry..
4
Saturday ... and a big need to have a great murtabak. So, off to Zam Zam. The years pass but the standard stays the same. For me the chicken murtabak...nicely seasoned chicken and hot, hot curry. Not disappointed. Craving satisfied. Yummmm......
4
I Ordered Mutton Briyani and Murtabak for dinner, the service was fast and the food was really good with value for money
3
for local food, i liked Murtaba... they dont have menus card so there was little difficulty in ordering food without knowing prices. Not lavish place for dine in but still very running and occupied
5
Monday night we had dinner at Zam Zams, located in the Arab Quarter of Singapore. This is a reaturatnt were the more covers the better. Don't expect fancy decor, but you will get great service and a fantastic meal, at a minimal price.The amazing aromas coming from the kitchen will get your sense racing and choosing a meal even more difficult. Best option, starve during the day, so you have an appetite and select a few different dishes to enjoy
2
 very cheap prices. very crowded. the taste of food iavpretty good if u like the kind. one note: you can take days to digest! meaning...the quality of food is very poor! therw are many places in aingapore where to try good arabian food...you spend a lil more but at keast you can sleep after dinner!!
3
It is situated in the arab quarter of Singapore right on one of the main streets. It rather looks like street food place as all the dishes are already ready. The choice includes fish and meat and with good selection of tastes. All the food is spicy, but not too hot, however the quality of the food doesn't look that good. They don't serve alchool, neither beers. Try once if you like spicy food
2
I love their plain roti prata. Sadly they won't make me plain prata anymore. I loved how crispy they were. Now they only serve "bigger dishes" meaning more expensive. So I even asked for them to make me an egg prata without egg...I would pay for the egg but don't want it ruining my crispy prata! They won't even do that now. So sad to stop going there. :
4
We found out about Zam Zam from a friendly taxi driver, he was telling us that his mother makes him drive from the other side of town just to get her takeaway Murtabak. With that recommendation we found the place and gave it a try and were very happy with the meal. I thought the serving size to the price was great. Very happy we got to try it out - a must try if you are near Kampung Glam
4
I always find the local food in Singapore less good than in Malaysia.The exception is Zam Zam, making an excellent Murtabak. Much better and meaty than most of the Murtabak in Malaysia.How could my experience be better? ... if they were serving lassi ..
4
the nasi beriyani is on average rate..but the beef murtabak is the things that make me craving it on and on :D
the price is affordable and have a lots of beef..
me recommend this restaurant !!!
5
Zam zam has the best murtabacks ever!! Also the prata and beef marsala is also delicious. It is a very busy café with people coming and going, the waiters are rushed off their feet, but great people.
3
the food taste quite, but the lamb murtabak quite dry. but it's value for money. clean and fast.. =)
5
The best Murtabak and Biryani in Singapore. The restaurant is always packed with customers. Had to queue up to get a table, but it's worth it. Drinks are not so good compared to their food.
3
The food here was pretty good but great price. Fast service and lots of people so u know it is safe :)
5
Had chicken and mutton murtabak and teh tarik with two friends here. The staffs served the dishes very fast and nice as well. If you don't understand the meaning of each dish, just take a look at all the pictures on the wall and tell the staffs what you want. It's very easy for foreigners to order
5
Your beef murtabak is super duper delicious. I also ate chicken murtabak but I am not a fan of it. Crazy plan with my sister. We will buy our flight ticket in the morning, then having murtabak for our lunch, takeaway beef murtabak and fly back home in the evening
5
First, the portion is Huge for me, even for small size murtabak. But also very delicious. They serve indian Halal food like Nasi Briyani and Murtabak. My favorite are Briyani Mutton and Mutton Murtabak. My recomendation is first go with mutton martbak for lunch, but if you come when dinner you should order Mutton Murtabak. Go easy with the size, please choose small size if it only for you. But you can order larger size if you want to share it.Its near by Sultan Mosque, 8-10 minute walk from Bugis MRT Station. If you can't speak English dont worry, they can speak melayu as well
4
Located very close to Haji Lane and within walking distance from Bugis MRT (approx. 10 minutes), Zamzam was already crowded with locals and tourists when we came on a Sunday at 10am.The restaurant felt a bit warm (there is a ceiling fan) and the tables/chairs were rather close to each other, but it didn't lessen our dining experience.As it was not yet lunch time, the briyani rice was not ready when we came, so we settled for only 1 portion of chicken murtabak. And boy, we were thankful we only ordered 1 murtabak, because the portion was big, the filling generous, the curry sauce for dipping was aplenty. The murtabak was quite spicy, even for our standards (hint: we are spicy-food-loving-Indonesians) The two of us had quite a challenge to finish it. The iced teh tarik was delicious and proved to be a good companion to down the murtabak.As with most hawker/modest restaurant in Singapore, do not expect service. Once we were seated, one guy gave us the menu, took our order, delivered our order, and we paid at the cashier to this older man who I think didn't speak much English (he counted to himself in Malay, the guy who took our order shouted our bill to the older man).Will definitely visit the place the next time we are in Singapore, next time to try the briyani rice.Spent approx. SGD 10 for one chicken murtabak and two teh tariks
4
Staying in an expensive 5 star hotel but want good cheap street food? This is the place! Must try is the mutton murtabak. Crispy layered dough with mince meat, onion, eggs.... Wow, heavently. If you are still up to it, the beriani, basmati long grain rice with saffron, is your second choice. I prefer the cooler night time dining, after 9pm. Oh ya, you will be served within 3 minutes..
3
An okay and cheap place to eat. The restaurant has little or no ambiance. Seems to be busy, so it must be doing something right.
5
Lovely food, one of the "must's" in SIngapore. Upstairs for the air con. I love the Biryani. A regular haunt for me when in Singapore.
As DustyBillBrisbane says "The place is basic Singaporean, spoon and fork only, no napkins, shared tables, the real Singaporean experience."
4
Had mutton briyani, a chicken and a beef murtabak. The beef murtabak was really superior, tasted very good. If at Arab street, definitely worth a visit.
5
Although the decor was ordinary and quite 'diner like' the food was amazing and cheap. There was quite a queue to be seated with people and the restaurant was busy. We ordered the biryani which was lovely and more than enough for two people but the beef murtabak which we ordered on our second visit was divine!We returned to the restaurant, travelling from Orchard Road, simply to eat the murtabak which we had twice in one day (spaced out across several hours)!The portions are very generous so it is great value for money and two people can eat comfortably from a single portion
5
If you like food with martabak or indian food. Must come to thia place. Come before lunch, because when lunchtime thia place really crowded and queue. Murtabak have many size, small, medium, large. If you come only 2 people or 3 people just choose medium size. I like prata beef curry. Super yummy and can share with you friend when you eat thia food
4
Me and friends all 4 of us went there last weekend on Saturday for lunch. We have read a lot of comment of the superb Murtabak Singapore. We ordered Murtabak Beef size $11 and Chicken Briyani for 1. such a huge Murtabak and delicious! Briyani Ayam/Chicken taste good as well. it cost us just $17.50 with full stomach! hehe. And guess what?? We even came back again on the next morning (Sunday) to had our breakfast again on the next day and this time we ordered Murtabak chicken size $8. !ts all worth it! btw if you guys wanna go there just took mrt and alight at Bugis Station. The restaurant located just opposite the Sultan Mosque
5
I went to this restaurant on 3 May 2014. The upper floor of the restaurant is air-conditioned, so I went to upper floor without thoughts becuase I want to taste some spicy food.I ordered the most famous food Murtabak (chicken). It was really delicious. At least 2 people could eat it even you ordered a small one.Besides, the milk tea tasted good. I recommended larger group of people to visit the restaurant to taste more food
5
I must must must eat here every time I go to Singapore.The location is easy to find as it is opposite to the Mosque at Arab street.I usually sit upstairs as they have air condition. It is easy to order as they have photographs of the food on the walls.My all time favorite is the Mutton Murtabak. I have no words to describe as it is like having a little peace of heaven! The Mee Goreng is very spicy and delicious. I like to have the Ice coffee as it has a lovely woody sweet taste and goes perfectly with all the spicy food.The other items in the menu are all equally excellent.I have been going here for more than fifteen years and the food is still the same and the price has not changed much also!Now that they have extended the sitting area upstairs I don't have to wait too long for a seat.I can not wait to go back again and again and again
4
We had mutton Murtabak and iced tea. The Murtabak was excellent but the 'medium' size was a bit big, more an 'american' sized helping. Still, we finished it off, as it was excellent, as was the iced tea. The place is basic Singaporean, spoon and fork only, no napkins, shared tables, the real Singaporean experience. The staff were fine and the service was good. It was all very reasonable pricewise and we will go back. Tip - upstairs has more room and air conditionin
5
Best Murtabak I've had, so tasty. This place is great, located in Arab Street opposite the mosque with seating on the ground floor, or some A/C seating upstairs. We ordered a medium beef and a medium mutton murtabak and it was far too much for 2 (though we did get pretty close to finishing them both...).Really cheap too.You are spoiled for great food in Singapore, but it is worth making a trip out here just for the murtabak
4
V friendly service, great mutton curry, chicken murtabak, quick, very reasonable. Could do with better washing facilities, but you can't have everything. Real mix of people, all backgrounds, v enjoyed it. Def will go back.
4
Known for it's murtabak, and it was well worth the try. Watch them make it in the window before you try it. It will sell you on it. Can't beat the price and the family church basement atmosphere. Just what the restaurant Gods ordered.
4
Food was very nice but need to improve the setting. The meal I had was very tasty but the variety was less and there was no menu except what was hung in the wall
4
Murtabak was a revelation. Chicken murtabak was delicious as served, but also good with the spiced sauces served as sides. The beef was a bit bland without the side sauces, but meant that it could be shared with a child that does not enjoy spices.Best meal we ate in Singapore.We ordered three dishes (two murtabaks and a biryani) between us plus three drinks for 22.5 SGD and left mountains of food uneaten. Four size options available, but don't go bigger than the second smallest size, as the portions are huge!The setting is pretty basic, with large shared tables. The staff saw we were foreigners and ushered us upstairs into the airconditioning. The service was excellent and the meals were on the table quite quickly
5
I cannot describe the sheer awesomeness of the food at Zam Zam. We had the chicken murtabak which was simply divine. A medium serve was plenty for my husband and I to share. Add in two soft drinks and the grand total on the bill came to $10! If you are anywhere near Bugis you have to try it
4
Heard of Murtabak and googled it. Zam Zam came up and it was near our hotel. It was awesome. Like a mutton, onion stuffed roti. Out of this world. Full of locals and for good reason, Dinner for 2 and 3 beverages $15 sn dollars. Would recommend. Not fancy but full of ambience. Across from the Mosque. Victory was next door, but Zam Zams was super busy. It has Air Con upstairs
4
...I've been there twice and ordered exactly the same thing. Both times it was delicious but on my second visit I had to pay a different price (higher). It wasn't much, but I think that's something you shouldn't do. Maybe it was a new cashier an that day, but my initial good impression crumbled a little bit
4
Once again, a great sign is the percentage of locals in a restaurant, and Zam Zam has 85% locals and a dash of visitors who walk around amazed at the "local-ness" of it all. This is a delicious place for Indian and Muslim food. Big on the menu are the Briyani's, mutton - and to visitors' surprise, "deer". We've eaten here a few times, and dash around the menu and are never disappointed. The staff is busy but helpful, there's a family feel to the place. The fact that it's rather barebones insides adds to the ambiance. HIghly recommend you try Zam Zam when you're on Arab street rather than the tourist traps near the Mosque which really just ship the food in from somewhere else. BTW - this place has great iced tea, too! Value? US$10 for lunch (or so). This is one of my favorites
5
# Best murtabak ever !# Huge portion (my mother can't finished her murtabak, we request them to pack it).# Good price (by Singapore standard).# Air condition dining room (go for upstairs) # Fast and friendly service. They let us put our luggage near cashier counter before proceed to 1st floor.# Located opposite the Sultan Mosque
5
If there's one thing I have to do when in Singapore, it's fill my face with murtabak ... and this place serves up a good one. Actually, probably the best one I've had of all the hawker centres etc. The prices are brilliant too.Great food, basic surroundings, but full of character, which is something that seems to be dying out in Singapore as everything goes ultra up market
4
we had some awesome biryani n lamb chops n coffee,, n kebab.. we truly loved to have food here n staff was very friendly n good promt service ..
4
The food was very good, also had take out.
Service very fast and efficient. Would come again next time in Singapore.
2
The fish head curry and murtabak were room temp. Served w/cucumbers in Russian dressing. Overall, not very flavorful or enjoyable. You can definitely find better in Singapore.
4
Look, just go there and enjoy the bread, the curry, the chicken roti, the beef murtabak, spicy lamb....No decor, no service, just solid good food at a very reasonable price. Good enough for me.
4
Great food, very popular place.
Really affordable, totally lacking in decor or service... You order, they bring it. Well worth trying if you are into South Asian style food
5
Typical local indian-muslim restaurant, we had chicken murtabak and mutton briyani which was just delicious. And that plus 2 drinks was $16.
I can't say more than that.
4
Zam zam is located in front of the famous Mosque.At first, I didnt think that the restaurant has two floors because it looked so small from the front.We ordered mutton martabak, fried rice, curry, and basmati rice.The food was great, the martabak was the best.The only food I didnt like was the fried rice, it tasted weird, However, the price was good. Not to expensive.
4
I choosed this place after the suggestion of the guide, even if when i arrived the first impression was not so good. The ambient is really poor simple and not 100% clean. The will make you forget everything, the Murtabak are amazing, with chicken or mutton: yummy! They are a sort of bread cake, stuffed with meat, spicies and vegetables. The price are really good
4
I and my sister went there around 1.20 pm as we thought we might get food as soon as we had arrived. However the foods came out around 2.15 pm also ppl are still so crowded that the time. The taste is nice especially the Chicken Murtabak. The chickens inside are soft and a bit spicy, the flour outside is crispy. The food portion is ok (we ordered 1 medium dish of Chicken Murtabak for two of us but it was left over) The price is reasonable as it is authentic Muslim food. But do not expect about service and atmosphere because they are so so poor
5
Chinese New Year in Singapore we thought we would be eating Chinese but we found all was closed. So instead we went to the Zam Zam halal Indian what a wonderful discovery delicious, cheap, plentiful and tasty all a hungry traveller could want. Defiantly worth a visit when in Singapore
4
ZamZam restaurant was a minute walk from where we stayed in Singapore. A taxi driver suggested we try it. The food is amazing.. specially the parathas and tea and the biryanis. I recommend it to everyone who like good muslim food.
5
I had 17 hour stopover in Singapore. On my office colleagues recommendation, I went to Zam Zam Restaurant for my breakfast. I ordered Egg Paratha and Chai (tea). Breakfast was very nice.
4
One of the well known halal restaurant in Singapore (for years) would probably be this Zam Zam. I went for the first time in 2009 and re visit in November 2013. The briyani is good and the huge portion of murtabak is highly recommended for first timers in Singapore. The only drawback is the limited space for customers. Do come early for lunch and dinner as this place is among the favorite spot not only for foreigners but also the locals. For families with small kids, if you are going there during peak hours, I would suggest for take-away meals
3
During my stay in Singapore, my taste buds were longing for Muslim food. From the balcony of Sultan Mosque, I happened to see the name board of Zam Zam Hotel. I was hesisatant to enter the Restaurant at 7 p.m.due to the crowd and lack of space. It is neither a 5 star or 3 star hotel. It is a small and ordinary restaurant for ordinary people. Because Restaurants offering Muslim food are few and far, people visit it for a change of taste. I preferred to a takeaway parcel of Mutton filled paratha called "Murtabak". I got it no time, as it seems it was pre-packed. By the time I reached home it was not so hot. Hence, the food is best taken hot & fresh at the Restaurant, but not at the peak hours. As during this time u have to wait for long hours not only to get a seat, but also to get your order served. To sum up, one can visit this Restaurant once in a while for a change and enjoy the food. But for health conscious,better to keep away and save calories
4
We have been to Singapore many times however we just discovered Zam Zam this visit. We had a little trouble finding it & then someone told us to go to Arab St & look out for the Mosque, & it is across the road - sure enough, we found it exactly there.It seems to be a favourite with local families. It is on 2 levels & the furniture consists of kitchen tables & chairs, sometimes you share a table.The murtabak (or matabark as I know it from Indonesia) is the BEST I have ever tasted. I had the mutton & it was so delicious! We will definitely be back on our next trip
5
...whether you choose mutton, chicken or even a more exotic version of their stuffed bread specialty, you will be pleased with a tasty “wrap” or meat crepe or most closely an Indian Stromboli---yum. If you’re on Arab Street and especially at an off-peak time, you should give this place a try. Avoid needing to use the restroom. Expect to spend less than $20 for 2. Skip the Mee Goreng. Tasty treat and unlike any stuffed paratha you may have tried before
5
Read many reviews about this place and thought of trying out for lunch. The food is amazing and the service is quick! It is a no frills restaurant and so forget about ambiance etc. If you want to eat something good without too much worry about anything else, please do try this place. I am hungry thinking about it now :
5
We read about Singapore Zam Zam from a local travel blog and decided we have to try it. The food was great!! We had Murtabak and Biryani on suggestion of the nice group we share the table with. This is also another experience to share a table with complete strangers, but we enjoyed it thoroughly and followed their suggestion on what to order. We did try Murtabak else where, but this was truly the best
1
Singapore Two Zam Zam... The rude restaurant in Singapore !!AFTER explored some of the interesting places around Singapore. Now, time for us to enjoy our dinner. So hungry you know ! My wife suggested that we have our dinner at Restoran Beriyani Zam Zam. The famous restaurant in Singapore! well, since the restaurant is near to our hotel, we choose this restaurant. Besides, we never try the menu.. Beriyani Zam Zam, sound weird.  From Bugis Street we walked to this restaurant. Around 100 meter. So tired.Unfortunately, when we arrived at the restaurant.. Tiada meja kosong.. haiya !! we feel a bit disappointed. We try to find another restaurant that maybe available in the surrounding area. Once again, we are disappointed. All restaurants have already closed their business... hmmm.. Then, we decided to go back to the restaurant zam zam.. And this time, we were lucky as there is an empty table.This restaurant has many customers.. Pekerja restoran ni pun sibuk membuat kerja masing2... But, that is not the main reason for them not to take orders from us. We were sitting at the table for 15 minutes. Waitress just pass in front of us. hmmm... After 20 minutes, I went into the restaurant to order food.. "self service" . I think this is the best way for us to order food. After reviewing the menu, then I make my order from the waiter. BUT, they give me an answers that really make me disappointed !!! For me, this restaurant are VERY RUDE !Me: Hello, I would like to order food for dinner.Cook: Open your eyes mister.. I am not a waiter.. I am a chef (padahal tukang buat roti canai).. want to make your order.. ask the waiter.. you understand or not.. ada faham !!Perghhh... poyo betul la tukang wat roti canai ni.. At this time, I still can be patient. Even they give me disappointed answer. Never mind, maybe dorang busy sampai tekanan kerja.. I went back to the table. After so long we still at the same place. what.. whether we are invisible or semua pekerja restoran ni buta !!Once again, I went into the restaurant.. This time, I ordered our drink from the cashier.. And I also bring the drinks to our table.. hmmm.. "part time waiter".. Still frustrated, I decided to make order from waiter at the food counter. I think I will get layanan baik from this waiter. But, they are all the same.. Semua kurang ajar ajar dan biadap.. Tua atau muda sama saja !!Me: "Uncle, I nak pesan satu set Beriyani Zam Zam Mutton" (a polite tone).Waitress: "You pegi duduk dulu.. nanti ada orang ambik order" (gross tone)Me: "Saya suda duduk almost an hour.. tapi takde sape pun yang ambik order"Waitress: "You mau bungkus ka atau makan sini"Me: "I nak makan sini la uncle"Waitress: "Nasi suda habis.. mau tunggu lagi 20 minit baru siap masak"Me: "Tadi baru je I nampak you buka bekas nasi yang besar tu.. ade separuh.. boleh buat sepuluh set beriyani.. I sudah duduk situ dekat sejam uncle.. sekarang you nak I tunggu lagi 20 minit?? what, you think I nak sangat makan kat restoran ni." (I lost my patience).Then, I go to cash caunter and pay our drinks.. Not enough with that, the cashier also very rude.. what wrong with these guys? They don't know how to speak softly. What they know is only scolding customer. I wonder why other customers still can get layanan baik? hmmm... double-standard.. Perhaps, we are Malaysian.. They are Singaporean.. are they hate Malaysian? Serious.. I have few friends who have been to the restaurant. They all give the same opinion. They also recevied poor service from this restaurant. I said to the cashier.. " You know what.. Tonight is the night that really unfortunate for me and my wife as well.. hmm... I promise to myself, this is my first and last I entered your restaurant.. good night and have a nice day"So, for Malaysian people... Better avoid to come to this restaurant!

My friend and I went to this restaurant because of other friend's advise. First floor was full of people so we walked to the second floor. There was no empty seat too. We walked to find empty seat then we found it. I ate chicken bryani and I like it. My friend ate Chicken chop chop something I can't remember its name. She waited for this food so long. I asked the staff and he could remember what I ordered. Its taste was good. I really like it too. Delicious ! Love them 
4
This place is not cozy place to hang out or something like that. But the food has original taste and very delicious. My fav are martBak and ice tea tarik. I always visit this place whenever i visit singapore.
5
My wife and I loved our meal here. She had heard about this great restaurant that was somewhat utilitarian in its approach. We had chicken murtabak which was quite spicy and a lovely beef bryani. The items were $6 Singapore dollars each! The plate sizes were much bigger than what you get at a hawker. They were great value plus they were delicious. We knew the setting would be very unassuming and it did not disappoint. The dishes were stained with past spices and the service was plodding but all in all we can't wait to go back
2
Brought some overseas guests for dinner one Saturday night and thought it was the biggest mistake ever. Not sure what the hold up was but dinner for two families consisting of 2 briyanis and 4 murthabaks made us wait almost a whole hour.Food was alright, the briyani was tasty but the murthabaks were cold, like they had been sitting out for a bit. Certainly disappointing
4
Had brunch at Zam Zam together with family. We had beef murtabak, roti prata (plain, onion, egg & onion) and mutton bryani. The dishes were served with fish, vegetable and chicken curry. And as the last time we went to Zam Zam, the food was excellent and it was service with a smile. The place is also in a nice area where you get a feeling of old Singapore
5
Just in front of Sultan Mosque, between North Bridge road and Arab Street, lies one Kosher food in Singapore. It is a mix between local Indian Arab food. First of all. Nasi Bryani (Bryani Rice). It is Excellent. The best Bryani I ever taste I believe. With just 6 $, you'll get one portion. I choose the beef Bryani. They also serve Chicken and lamb Bryani.First and second time here, I order Beef Bryani. Third time, I order something more special. The Deer martabak (I hope I announce it correctly). Looks like a pizza, with their own different ingredient, with not a beef but Deer meat. Awesome. This is special. But don't worry there are plenty of choices there. You won't get bored.The place is clean, fast serving with professional staff. Enjoy. Two Thumbs Up
4
We went to Zam Zams after reading the reviews. My daughter and I ordered the mutton and chicken murtabaks and my husband had a biryani. We absolutely loved the mutton murtabak. We didn't realise the chicken in the chicken murtabak was chicken tikka — still very tasty, but the mutton was our favourite. My husband went with the biryani — I agree with some other reviewers that it is not a "true" biryani — but he enjoyed it anyway. I didn't try any of the sauces that came with the meal as they looked very oily but my husband enjoyed them. It's not the cleanest place (try not to look at the back of the chairs) and the cheap melamine plates are stained orange from the tikka but it was fascinating to watch the murtabaks being made at lightning speed downstairs and the flavours were great
5
AMAZING food at ridiculously cheap prices. The lamb murtabak is to die for and the gravy that comes with it... well... it was one of the tastiest things I tasted in Singapore. Actually, that's a lie: it was THE tastiest thing we tasted. How do they make that gravy? Just fantastic, fantastic, fantastic, fantastic.Make sure you visit this place if you are in Singapore. It's that good
4
Was taken here as a part of the "Singapore Local Food Trail" (see separate review). Murtabak was a new experience for us, and we are not locals, so while I can't really engage in the debate over if this is the best spot or not, I can tell you it was really quite good!We had both the chicken and the mutton. The chicken was absolutely divine - great texture and flavor throughout the chicken. The catsup-covered cucumbers and curry sauce were excellent additions. The mutton was a bit dry, and although it was tasty, the chicken was significantly better.Definitely worth seeking out if you are looking for something uniquely Singaporean
3
Biryani was tasty, though only 3 slivers of pickled cucumber. Unremarkable place. Like any Indian Muslim eating shop, it is rather oily & dirty. Aircon upstairs helped but there are only 8-chaired tables, so you'd have to share your table with other customers. Service was business-like and without a smile - like any typical Indian restaurant. Zero atmosphere. Good for filling the stomach at reasonable price
4
I've been to this place with my friends for lunch and had a mutton biriyani and a deer roti. It was good and tasty specially the biriyani. The only problem is parking which is little tough to find a spot beside the road. Prices are reasonable compared to other places in Singapore
3
I went there and i found it not that interesting .. regular cheap indian food and it seems to be popular place for the locals as there are better restaurants around the area.
5
The taste of the foods very delicious .... eating over here twice , lunch and dinner . Will come back again !
1
The waiters are not flexible and lazy. Ask them to speak to their boss, they want me to go down on my own. Will not visit again. Do not encourage you to come. Food is lousy, service is poor.
5
It's undoubtedly the best murtabak in the world. Family has eaten there for 3-4 generations and it's been there for almost a century. A must visit if you are visiting singapore
4
We went there after goggling "The best Murtabak in Singapore" and weren't disappointed. I give you advance warning, choose your size carefully! The portions here are huge, we had the chicken Murtabak and ordered a medium size, upon the receipt of this carbo loaded plate of deliciousness, I became well aware I was way over my head, it was huge! I did my very best but sadly fell short of completion, in combination with the delicious curries for dipping, it was sensational (and no doubt sensational for my waist line) If you like fried meat filled pancakes, I cant recommend this enough

We stopped in today and had the chicken murtabak and the mutton murtabak and they were excellent! The staff was friendly & they were especially attentive to our toddler. Two small murtabaks were large enough to fill us up. The kopi was quite nice as well

We stumbled upon Zam Zam when we were exploring Arab Street. Although I had read about this place, i was not sure of the location....so it was pure luck....and it was a very memorable eating experience................we ordered Chicken Murtabak and it came to the table piping hot, with the accompanying Chicken and Fish gravy....the portions were very generous and well worth the money.....it was a delicious dish with lots of spice and flavour!!!!!The roti was light and the fiilling very generous too....Overall a very yummy lunch in the vibrant Arab Street!!!!We went there on a Friday and it was just after prayers, so the place was packed....nevertheless the staff made sure to get a table for us asap and the food arrived in record time......Definitely well worth the visit and would have gone back if we had time!!!!

For Murtabak lovers either chicken or beef, it is a must to visit when coming to Singapore. The taste is excellent when it is served hot, however it was upsetting when served cold. A so - so services as it is a 'mamak' style restaurant. However, this is the one of the Singaporean life style with multiracial dine together under one roof

a Singaporean friend of mine insisted that we try the beriyani here: its not really beriyani, not as I define it..essentially, chicken/meat cooked separately, and then the rice is spooned over it..the quality of each, separately, was fine, and the portion was large, but the basmati doesn't match Islamic..fish curry was excellent though, spicy and tangy..side dishes of vegetables were generously portioned..good service..the murtabak seems to be the USP here.. there was a group of Japanese tourists at the next table which had obviously come here specifically for thi

Excellent Food with all the Indian, Chinese, Cantonese and Singaporean Dishes. Quick & Prompt Service. Eager waiters to receive your orders. Get usually crowded during peak times. Dinner time is like forever if you're looking for a free table.Enjoyed the meal with family. Kids loved the Cheese & Egg Parathas. I personally liked the Chicken Murtabak, a local favorite. However, the Mutton version is also good. We didn't have time for the Deer Murtabak, as we were informed that it would like a little longer than the usual to serve. But its a definite try for food mongers if you have the time and space.The briyani's were excellent and most often we took 'parcels' in the mornings, due to travel. There's a little bit of everything for everyone.Well most of the staff, except a few were in a careless attitude. I guess it might due to the reason of being popular. The cash counter staff were like "Take it or Leave it Attitude". I offered my sincere respected to the elderly gentleman at the cash counter irrespective of the the bland attitude offered.Overall, we recommend this outlet to all the visitors. A definite try. Also its Halal Food. Eat with confidence.I hope that the above info was helpful and you would consider marking my review as helpful !!We all need to encourage others as well to contribute their insights here.Cheer

The location just opposite the mosque make it convenient for muslim traveller to stop for food and prayer. The food was good and service was great.
4
After 2 nights of poor choices for dinner tried zam zams from a recommendation. Definitely very local, and fairly basic restaurant setup, but good murtabak and biryani and friendly non-production line service who wanted to help. Food was freshly made and tasty.
4
This one is for Indian food lovers. And those who are not into Indian food, this place may change your view on it and would make you fall in love. The décor may not be impressive but they make it up with the mouth watering food which has a lot of flavors (typical of Indian food!!). The Biryani they serve deserves a tremendous applause for the way it tantalizes the taste buds and the gravy is delicious. I, being a lover of Indian food, simply couldn’t keep away from this place. I highly recommend it simply because of its food

Zam Zam was a wonderful surprise for my husband and me. We had made a special trip to Arab Street for batiks and to the area to visit the Masjid Sultan, located at Muscat Street and North Bridge Road. Since Zam Zam is right across the street from the large mosque, we ventured inside for some delicious and very affordable Indian food. Downstairs, with no air conditioning, was packed. Our host guided us upstairs to the air conditioned space upstairs. There are numerous long tables where people eat communal style. You will never know who will be sitting next to. Menus are not brought to you as everything Zam Zam serves is on the wall. There are some pictures for some items in case you are not familiar with their food.By now, anyone reading reviews for Zam Zam should know that they are very famous for their Chicken Murtabak – a huge roti prata wrap with seasoned or grilled chicken and onion. A wonderful curry sauce accompanies the great Chicken Murtabaks. Zam Zam is not frugal with the sauce thus you will definitely have some left over. The Chicken Murtabak comes in three sizes: Small (S$6 / $5), Medium (S$7 / $6) and Large (S$11 / $9). My husband, who has a good appetite, opted for the medium size. He found that to be completely satisfying.I went with the Chicken Biryani. It is a rice-based dish made with spices, rice and chicken, eggs, or vegetables. The elaborate rice pilaf can come with saffron–infused milk and a drizzle of melted butter over the top. It was good, but the Chicken Murtabak was clear favorite of the night.We left Zam Zam full and satisfied, and our pocketbooks were not much lighter as the prices here are excellent. It was a great way to finish off our batiks hunting expedition. Between the quality of the food and the very affordable prices, it is definitely a restaurant one may want to make a return trip to while in Singapore. If we had more time, we would have had Chicken Murtabak for another meal at 699 North Bridge Road

Zam Zam serves excellent local food! It is located within walking distance of Bugis MRT station, near Arab Street. As a personal comment, even though the restaurant logo says that they serve Arab food, I felt the curry was more like Indian food (but I'm certainly not a food expert..). Anyhow, the food is fantastic, and a must try!!!Also, there are many stores and attractions to shop around in the Bugis area. I thought that this area of Singapore was my favorite out of all the places we've visited to. So look around the area after tasting the great food at Zam Zam
5
Just got back from a family trip to Singapore, Completely by luck Zam Zam was opposite our hotel in Bugis-Arab street area, the food especially murtabak and biryani was stunning, great taste and really well priced. Not the place to spend all day but for great tasting food this is the place to go :-
4
Go here for the Indian food and you will not be disapointed! The food is great and has this wonderful mix of true Indian and a bit of its own and some Singaporean in the middle :)Go for the bryani rice and try the murtabak
4
As a spicy food and spices lover, I think this restaurant is one of the most exotic and delicious Indian restaurant in Bugis area. I came here 3 days in a row for dinner . They serve Nasi Biryani, murtabak with various filling, including deer (!), pity I didn't try that. The place is easy, just the opposite of Sultan mosque close to Bugis MRT. The price is reasonable.I dont have Indian heritage but I just love everything they serve there. I would definitely come here with my family once I got a chance to visit Singapore again..
5
2 words....chicken murtabak. Before today I had no idea what a Murtabak was. Now I do and is good!!! For those not in know a Murtabak is a stuffed pan fried bread (like a roti or naan stuffed with yummy spiced chicken goodness). The dining room itself is basic and you share tables with other diners, the service is ok but who cares when the food is so good. My husband had the chicken biriyani which was also very good, but he kept sneaking mouthfuls of my Murtabak. The bill was very reasonable and we will be back!
4
We didn't know that on a Saturday during lunchtime there would be a wait for a table & to be served but it was worth it. The murtabak came in small, medium & large & the large would easily feed 2 people. We also have the mutton biryani which was excellent. If you're too hungry to wait for a table Victory cafe next door is just as good
4
You don't come here for refined dining, but to get down and dirty with delicious murtabak or roti canai. Very good prices.
Pretty view of the mosque opposite.
5
Had to call waiters more than 3 times to place orders. Was seated close to counter but was ignored nonethelessly.
4
This was recommended to us by our Taxi Driver. Downstairs appears very small but when you head up stairs you will find about 100 other diners. We had a soft drink and plenty of food and the bill was $15 - cant complain about that.
4
Good food. Murtabak was especially good. DId not fo too much for Biryanis. Gravy dish is also good.
Worth a visit to foodies wanting some variety
Ambience is not the best thing. But then food is what matters.
3
Murtaba is the only good thing here. Don't experiment too much. Just be content with what they serve best.
5
Excellent food and could not grumble. Must be one of the best eating experiences because all the local people use it. Looks rough and ready but dont be put off. You will enjoy this food treat.
4
We enjoyed the mutton murtabak and chicken Briyani. Pricing very reasonable.
Service was pretty fast.

Zam Zam is probably one of the oldest restaurants in Singapore and very popular with the locals for the murtabak. This is not a place to relax over a long lunch, even in the air-conditioned hall upstairs. There are long tables and unless you are in a group of eight, be prepared to share the table with others. There are notices stating that the upstairs is for people who order biryanis and murtabak. As these are probably the most popular dishes, there are constant queues, and the turnover is rapid. We ordered the chicken, lamb and fish murtabak and a plate of nasi goreng. Except for the fish murtabak, the fillings in the chicken and lamb ones were not tasty or sufficient, although the roti was light and not oily. I’ve eaten much tastier murtabak in Penang. The nasi goreng was below-average. I’m happy I had a meal there, given its history, popularity and the local buzz, but will probably not visit again, as we are spoilt for choice in Singapore. I’d suggest ordering the murtabak and biryani, which is what the restaurant claims it does best, as the other food did not look very appetising
4
Everytime I visitt Singapore over the years I like to take in Satay, blackened stingray wings in the chillie sauce and the famous Murtabak at Zam Zam. Real hustle to the place and all the food is great. One other good place for Murtabak with the curry dipping sauces is Dicksons on corner Dickson Rd in Little India. Give them both a go. One for breakfst one for lunch
4
On Sunday, 21 July 13, we took our friends to the iconic ZAM ZAM restaurant in North Bridge Road. They were from South Africa and the husband loves meat and bread. They were very impressed when they had a preview of the preparation of murtabak by the chef at the entrance.We climbed up a flight of very narrow and rickety steps to the lounge on level 2.It was quite crowded but we managed to get a table for 4. We ordered 2 chicken briyani, a lamb briyani, a beef briyani and a large mutton murtabak to share. The mutton murtabak was great. Very much better than the one we had at the Satay Club at Lau Pasat a few nights ago. The briyani rice was very aromatic and the meat very tender. We had a great time at ZAM ZAM. The final bill with drinks was very reasonable - under S$60.00!:)
4
This place was packed. Great prices, quick service and the best halal meat dishes around!
An absolute joy! Check it out.
5
I love to have chicken murtabak and mutton biryani here, very cheap and very delicious. a little spicy but I loved that.
4
Lonely Planet Review spot on - basic décor - big industrial tables that they squeeze everyone onto. Fast service & turnover. Really good food - murtabak was delicious. Cheap. Remember no alcohol served as it's in Kampong Glam and is Muslim.
4
A friend in Singapore introduced me to this place - it's awesome.
Mutton murtabak is delicious. Great local crowd here too, it's always packed, but turns over fast, and there's more room upstairs. I've eaten here a bunch of times and always enjoyed it.
4
Not the place if you're on a tight budget.The whole experience blew me away. I've had a lot of Indian meals of varied results.This place takes it to another level,quality of food,presentation,staff,.An unbeatable experience.It is on the pricey side,but you get what you pay for,absolutely unforgettable
5
I love the mutton murtabak and fish briyani here. It's the best, especially the curry that accompanies the fish briyani. Fish curry is something that is difficult to master and Zam Zam has definately mastered it. Some reviews here mentioned that the food is a little spicy, but not to my taste. The take away service is very fast and efficient too
5
like - scrumptious mamak food. choice of roti canai, singapore fried noodle, mutton briyani. take away service is very fast.dislike - sometime overly crowded. upper floor and also ground floor full of patrons. if go alone, most of the time you need to share table with people you do not know. its an awkward feelin
4
The title says it all, it's a great roadside little restaurant, popular among locals. The food is fresh and very tasty.Don't come here for te service or if you like fancy places, but if you want a true local experience it's the place to go in this area
4
I never forget to come to indian restaurant when come to Singapore. I addicted of Nasi Briyani. Yes, it is easy to find Zam Zam restaurant. You can go to arab street and this place is in front of Sultan Mosque. The favorite menu are nasi briyani, deer martabak and masala. After that the menu will be completed by one big cup of Tarik Tea ( teh tarik ). It is a great menu and really recomended. Indian yummy food ! Since the food have a good taste, many people from manu culture come this place every minutes. I can see the queque from visitor when go to this restaurant. But don't worry, it is always place for a great food
4
good food, the murtabak is definitely a must try. their curry is good as well the biryani. the place is little bit run down and not squeaky clean due to many patrons but the food smells really good, try going inside the kitchen to appreciate the other food preparation. it is also worthwhile to ask about the history of the resto
5
If you are Murtabak lover, this place is must go. They are known for Murabak and with a great history of awesome Murabak. Chicken Murabak of Zam Zam is the best and a must try.
4
The food is not too spicy, the briyani and mee goreng are palatable and most will find it interesting mixture of spice. Service is fast and courteous. However, even though I asked for less sugar, the coffee served was a wee bit too sweet.
5
Zam zam is a must try for everyone. It is a local Indian delicacy. Fried pancake with layers of spiced meat, eggs and vegetable dip with curry! Prices are reasonable too. Queue can get long at times but worth it!
5
must must must must try, if you have been hunting for the best murtabak in town. Zam zam has been one of the longest surviving restaurant along Arab street of Singapore, with a wide range of dishes.
4
We heard about the Restaurant and wanted to visit there at least once during our stay. And as the luck would have it, we were staying at Landmark Village, which is only a few meters away from the restaurant and saw the name board on our way to the Hotel.So we did not hesitate to have our first food in Singapore at Zam Zam and I enjoyed a full Murtabak alone, though the same could be easily shared by two. The best thing I noticed was the patient hearing the suppliers give; as because of some unfamiliar names in the menu, we had some questions. The restaurant was full when we went there at about 2.00 pm but got tables in two places within few minutes. I had imagined many Indian crowds but the reality was otherwise.The taste of food and their quick service made us visit the joint again for dinner the next day. Cost-wise too the restaurant was affordable compared to Singapore standards and we all had a wonderful eating experience and will not think twice before recommending the restaurant to friends visiting Singapor
5
Nothing not to like !! They served great Chicken Beriyani & you must try the Chicken of Beef Murtabak, its to die for !!! You know the food is good when cars side park & line up to take away the Beriyani Rice !! Without a doubt when I visit Singapore again, Resturant Zam Zam will be on top of my list to visit !!! Good Job !
5
Make time to visit this very authentic Arabian delight. We went for breakfast and found the waiter to be very helpful in navigating the menu. The food was not your standard breakfast fare and it was off the charts delicious and inexpensive. A MUST on your Singapore trip
5
During our recent visit to the Arab Street area in Bugis district, we had a late breakfast stop at Singapore Zam Zam restaurant and were very much impressed with the chicken murtabaks being served up here. Zam Zam takes high praise on Tripadvisor and we are happy to report that past praise for the food here seems to be well warranted. When arriving at Zam Zam, you can watch them preparing the murtabeks through the clear window, which is actually an interesting thing to do even if you don't sample the food here. They are happy for you to take pictures and we even talked to the man preparing the murtabeks. He said his favourite variety was chicken so we decided to give that one a try. As suggested, we ordered the small chicken murtabak (SG$6), having already had an early breakfast. Wish we had skipped the earlier meal and tried more of the food on offer at Zam Zam as the murtabak was simply a superb dish. The chicken, which seemed to be shredded tandoori chicken was soft and flavourful and went very well with the fillings and ingredients of this dish. Every bite was full of flavour and much enjoyed, served with a bit of curry sauce and thinly sliced cucumbers, this was just very much enjoyed (rating 5 of 5). Something we'd target for repeated visits if we had something similar to this back home. Lime juice (SG1.50) was served too sweet for our liking but that was fine as it balanced the strong flavours of the meal. Entire kitchen area is open glassed and transparent. This is very often a sign of good things, nothing to hide from customers. They have a no-frills seating area, just plastic tables and chairs only. You're coming here for the excellent food, not ambiance. Overall, this was just a great breakfast stop, something we'd seek to repeat regularly if we had something similar near our home. Based on our experience, we can highly recommend a stop at the Singapore Zam Zam restaurant for those planning a visit to the Arab Street area
5
If you are in Singapore, Zam Zam is definately a must! Went there twice during the 3 days we were there and ate the yummy three layered beef murtabak, TWICE! Service was quick and they even have drive through service. We were lucky cause when we went to Zam Zam, there were not that many crowds so we could easily get seats. Did not try the briyani but guessing that it must be yummy too since majority of customers ordered that. (By the way: we packed the murtabak and ate it later, while it was cold and it still tasted superb! Imagine how lovely it taste eating it fresh from the pan!
5
we really enjoyed the service and the food...murtabak is a new word to my food lexicon---wonder if i can get one in Melbourne....great value and a very colourful atmosphere---if you are expecting white table clothes and your own table do not bother--not for you---but good biryani and the buzz of Arab street something for you..
4
Not your luxury posh restaurants but exellent for hearty filling tasty food.
try the meat Murtabak exellent.
busy noisy place not much ambience but great food
must a visit...just opposite the historic sultan mosque
4
I love their muthabark its very tasty with very flavourful oils and wonderful texture.
Don't expect much with ambiance but expect good food and a nice noisy environment.
I must say the presentation is a little crude but that's all part of the charm
5
We really enjoyed the zam sam food near arab street. The lamb biryani is out of this world and the tea was so good. The price is cheap for Singapore and I would highly recommend this place.
5
Simply the best due to the rich flavours and aroma in their Briyani. Mutton is succulent and the curry is not overbearingly spicy too. A must try when one is in Singapore.
3
We ordered some thai noodles which was average. The place is a roadside eatery and is popular with the tourists. I suppose we should have had a biryani which was popular here.
4
I had dinner here on my first night in Singapore. Service was efficient and friendly. Server recommended the beef murtabak and iced tea with milk for this first time visitor and it was really tasty. I did a take away on my second visit and had the chicken biryani. It was equally excellent. The only downside was the temperature inside the restaurant. I sat down stair and it was very hot, and the spicy food only made it more unbearable. Perhaps upstair seating would be better
5
We come here to eat whenever we are in Singapore and when we are at home we dream of the murtabak!!! The food here is great and also cheap. The chicken murtabak is our favourite but there's also lovely biryini, nasi goreng and others. The lime juice is very refreshing. It's also great for people watching...The hustle and bustle of this great restuarant is great fun to watch, people coming and going, waiters rushing around. Great fun
4
I love Zam Zam's murtabak the most, beef and chicken. The mutton / lamb briyani is equally good :). But for a Malaysian like me, the price kinda steep due to the exchange rate. The atmosphere is always crowded, though the food arrives relatively faster compared to the amount of time spent waiting for our table. will visit this restaurant again, despite the crowd & long wait
2
Went around for a quick lunch on a friday and the lower floor was as hot as an oven. Their chicken biryani is served the traditional way - rice and chicken separated. Rice had a good flavour and chicken was slightly under under cooked, had an oily after taste since food here floats in an oily gravy. I ended up gulping some ENO right after I went back. The murtabak might be their speciality but I wouldnt want to try it for reasons stated below.Although reasonably priced, food lacks the oomph factor which brings you back to the place. There are a couple of similar places next to this one so they all try to pull customers in. If you are the kind who doesnt want to see a bit more of oil/spices in their food, better find another place
3
Briyani & Murtabak are good. We ordered Chicken Briyani and Mutton Murtabak. THe porton is very big. It is of very reasonable price. But, the service is just so slow... the food comes after 20-30 minutes. Asking for a bill taking minutes. Then, only when we stood up, they passed me the receipt.... Maybe they just don't care... as there are too many customers... local or tourists.BTW, please go upstairs as there are air-conditioning
4
I have to say best murtabak. I found chicken murtabak tastes better than mutton. This place is located at Arab street and can be reached from Bugis MRT station. You may not find the environment not as the best but food is great
5
Get yourself a lime juice, mutton murtabak and a beef biryani.. that is all. Service is no frills - don't expect a smile, just give them fingers.. the universal sign for how many seats you want.. sit back and relax.. bring a big stomach
5
Friendly staffs, amazing food, clean floor and a long queue to get a tabe but somehow you'll be served, even at peak hours....with smile
5
This is one of the best murtabaks i've had the pleasure to try in Singapore. When choosing, go for the chicken which is a wee better then the other ones.
4
The resto was strategically located, right in front of the Sultan Mosque in Bugis. It took us about 7-8 mins walk from the Bugis MRT. Walking under the scorching sun with a cranky toddler was no joke.. But once we reached there and when our orders were served on the table, it was all worth it. The murtabak which was S$12 was the best i have ever tried. We did try the mutton bryani rice (S$6) but it was just average, nothing to shout about. Visiting the resto was one the highlight during our short trip..  Zam Zam restaurant, checked
4
Visited Singapore Zam Zam during lunch hour and found it really packed and hectic. They took sometimes to seat us but they were polite. My friends and I gotten the food and drinks not long after we order. We ordered beef murtabak, chicken murtabak, chicken briyani and mutton briyani.While the murtabaks were like ah-ma-zingggg, I felt the briyanis were quite overrated. The meat were tender and delicious but the rice was somewhat too overwhelmed with rosewater. I still prefer batu pahat briyani over zam zam.The restaurant is amazingly clean
1
Don't expect any friendly waiter to serve you. The waiter I had, told me off, saying if I wanted something, should tell him in the first place, so that he does not have to go to kitchen again. They just want your money, esp if you are a tourist. Food is average. Better murtabak elsewhere. Make sure you check your bill and be specific in your orders. Honestly, I won't go to this place anymore
4
We were referred to this restaurant by one of the boutiques around the area. The saleslady said, "try the murtabak and the ginger tea". We did just that. No regrets.As soon as we walked into the restaurant, we were greeted by smiles from the staff and were immediately directed to the upper level as it was air-conditioned. We were seated near the window, facing the main road and the Sultan Mosque. The place was clean and orders taken promptly. As both of us are non fans of red meat, we chose to try the chicken murtabak and a mug of ginger tea each. The murtabak was soft yet crispy with a generous amount of chicken meat. The tea was not too sweet and the ginger flavour was not too overwhelming. The food was reasonable priced.We stayed on for awhile after we finished our food but were not requested to leave even though the restaurant was starting to fill in. I suspect, from the no. of shopping bags which both of us were carrying, the staff must have known we were tired after all that shopping
4
If you are looking for decent murtabak and Biryani, this is one of the (if not the) place(s). I usually go for the chicken murtabak and mutton biryani. The portion is substantial and the curry is nice especially the fish curry. Prices for murtabak range from $5 - $20 and Biryani range from $6 - $6.50 (refer to photo).This place is usually crowded (even at 3+pm when I last visited on one Sunday). If you are coming via MRT, you can take a stroll down from Bugis MRT station (10-15 minutes walk)
4
While I can't say I have tried every location in Singapore that serves Murtabaks, Zam Zam has the best of the many I have tried. I like the mutton though chicken is good as well. This is a popular local place. If you are looking for atmosphere this will not be for you, but if you are looking for a great Murtabak for around $6 you will not find a better spot
5
Great food there! Would highly recommend the chicken murtabak and roti prata. Not to forget the teh tarik. Reasonable price and good food. Worth it to make a trip there.
4
Nice environment, friendly staff. Felt like having food at home.
Tasted some new dishes which proved to stomach filling as well as delicious. Rarely have deviated from the usual cuisine and liked something as much as on this occassion.
5
Excellent food.....loaction in the arab quarter, unpretentious decor but very well worth a visit to eat the fabulous food
4
The beef murtabak and chicken beriyani is nice. However, the portion is big, so you can opt for sharing, if not enough then you can always order more. Service is fast, we waited for less than 10 mins for the foods to be served even though the restaurant is crowded. I am not quite fond with the gravy that they served with the murtabak, so we requested for fish curry gravy, it tasted very good and way better.Downside: If you are driving, parking can be a problem expecially over the weekend. We parked very far from the restaurant, but at least we managed to find a parking spot after canvassing the area twice
3
What do you really expect from Zam Zam? Nasi Briyani mutton is the best. Chicken Briyani also good. I found the Briyani rice is superb, although the taste change a bit over the years, but I still think this is the place to find briyani rice, especially mutton briyani. The place is always crowded particularly during lunch time where you need to wait for 5 to 10 minutes. At times, you need to share you tables with others. The food is good, but the services is not as you would have expected. The upper floor is air-conditioned and is a better place to eat rather then at the ground level. Bring some tissues and wet tissues as well
5
SOooo good! awesome murtabaks on Arab street. Although very simple with no frills, the restaurant is spotless, sitting there for 30 min, the staff was constantly cleaning the tables and floors. just a really clean and delicious restaurant for a quick meal! the milk tea was also out of this world, and the staff super nice! loved it
5
I've eaten chicken and mutton briyani and mutton murtabak from there recently and all were excellent - as good as any i've eaten in Singapore. Very functional eating house - enter, eat, leave. Or take away. Can be very crowded, probably because the food is so good
5
The chicken murtabak and mutton briyani are superb. We were surely very hungry when we arrived here. But we don't think we're biased when we say the foods are delicious (haha!). The drinks are not too sweet; just nice.The waiters are helpful too as we tried to find out the best way to go to the next attraction on our list. We even bought murtabak to bring back home on our last day in Singapore!. =
5
Superb chicken murthabak. It's a thin roty with spicy chicken and egg. Wow I hav it whn ever I visit Singapore. It's open for breakfast too. The new entree of deer is not that great. Rose milk drink too is superb. Ambience is clean but humid. Nice Arabian surrounding with the mosque opposite the restaurant
4
The ordering and service are super fast. The rice and the chicken are just nice, can taste all the spices and the chicken meat are just right. The restaurant can be crowded at times. Easy walking distance from Bugis MRT station. Next to Landmark Village Hotel and Masjid Sultan.
4
Awesome lamb murtaba, decent beef briyani, good cappucino, bad ice tea. staff is ok, helpful and fairly fast.
2
Its really very poor service. There was no smile on the faces of the waiters. The food was cold and unhygenic. I will not recommend this one at all.
5
If you love trying curries and murtaback (savory pancake filled with meat, oinions, egg) served with curry - truly delicious! Try the fresh lime juice - very refreshing. the waiters are great to watch, shouting orders out and must have great memories.
3
Still have the same taste but they stop serving some selected dishes. But no too worry what they selling still as good as before.
4
whenever there's a craving for murtabak, this place comes to mind! fillings include mutton, chicken or sardine. for a fusion twist, ask for mutton murtabak with cheese. try that and also the briyani rice
3
Well we read through trip advisor and walked from Little Indian for 25 minutes until we reached Zam Zam. We hesitated before going in as to be honest it reminded me of a kabab house... Clearly busy with the locals but no clear seating area. That was upstairs and contained multiple plastic chairs in benches... As I said in the title it reminded me of a,canteen. Food was good though, and service was quick...if not a little basic. No nann bread, but I'll put that down to our too westenised expectations. Overall good.... But I would call it a low budget restaurant or cafe rather than a restaurant for a honeymoon couple :
5
Coming from Penang, I am very proud with Penang food and always boasted that the best murtabak is in Penang. Stumbled upon this Zam Zam and bought a chicken murtabak (SGD7.00). I was humbled. It tasted so good ! Portion easily feed two medium eaters. You'll get generous chicken chunks and eggs/cheese. Easily beating my favorite murtabak in Penang by miles....

One of my friend recommended this place to me. Whenever i feel like having "Murtabak" this is the place that comes to my mind. Bit expensive when you compared to those Murtabak which you eat out side. But this one is unique and tasty. Worth spending your money. Every time i go there to try other dishes, but i end up in "Chicken Murtabak".Highly recommend this place for "Murtabak"

My boyfriend has been going to this place for 18 years and I remember being very apprehensive the first time he took me there 7 years ago as this place looks a rather dodgy, but the food is great. Make a point to sit upstairs as it is air conditioned and you don't get the fumes from the traffic. The Murtabak are amazing, especially the deer. We eat here often when in Singapore and although we are completely full when we leave, the bill has never been more the $25 for the two of us including drinks. Try the Bandung (rose flavoured milk) and the lime water, they are both delicious

You can do much better Indian food and hospitality than go t o Zam Zam. The food is passable, but the service is decidedly horrendous. There is only that much bad services I am willing to put up with for amazing food, but when their main dishes turns up too oily and too salty, I wished I was at Casurina Prata instead

Place is casual but clean with beautiful view of masjid Sultan Mosque.
Food especially Murtabak is simply delicious
Friendly place

I've been a big fan of Zam Zam Restaurant since I was a kid back in 80's. It was first introduced to me by my dad and after I got married and had kids, I introduced to them as well. The restaurant has been there for decades. The 2-storey restaurant is located across the Sultan Mosque. It's quite difficult to park nearby during the day, but if you come during the night, you can park along the way. I usually park at Raffles Medical Center just about 2 blocks away from the restaurant. Walking distance from the parking area would be around 5 to 7 minutes. If you are taking public transport, you can reach here by taking the MRT to Bugis station and walk towards the North Bridge Road, it's about 10 minutes walk. And once you're full and can't bother to walk after meal, you can easily take cab from here.There are two things that you need to try here - the Murtabak and Beryani. Those are Zam Zam's trademark. In case you're wondering what Murtabak is, it's a stuffed pancake or pan-fried bread which is commonly found in Saudi Arabia. You may choose either chicken, mutton or beef's Murtabak. There are other dishes available here, but trust me, you won't regret by trying the Murtabak and Beryani!

Zam Zam's is a famous eating place for many visitors. It is Halal/Muslim food. To start with, go upstairs to eat, but be prepared for crowds and to share a table. Downstairs is small, hot and by the road. The specialty is murtabak. I prefer Chicken, but the also have mutton and other varieties like deer even now. The various flavors - especially when you dip your spoonful into the curry - is delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant - especially the murtabak. This place is very convenient if you are sightseeing by the Sultan Mosque

Have been to Karachi 5X between Oct 2008 & early 2009; watched Obama's inauguration from KarachiSo I should know what briyani should taste like.Zam Zam is a long established restaurantThe taste is run of the mill; not worse than a briyani stall in a Housing Development Board public housing estateHowever, Zam Zam is overpriced...anytime chicken/mutton briyani is priced @ $6.. that is way overpriceddrinks such as tea/coffee or canned drinks have also gone upI can get the same chicken/mutton briyani for less in Marine Terrace; where I am a regular & get extra helpingZam Zam doesn't get it ... the best business is REPEAT businessI'm all choked up about the price; took a huge bite .... OUTTA my walle

Some of the travel books list Zam Zam as 1 of the top 10 places for cheap food. I tend to agree. The food is great and the prices are great. You are eating on the sidewalk in the heart of Little India but hey that's part of the charm of the place. 5 star dining this isn't but the quality of the food makes up for it. Be an adventurer and give it a go

One word. Murtabak. This place looks a little dodgy from the outside, and the service will leave you wondering if the staff have even noticed you, but it is so worth it and for $S16 for a serve of Murtabak, a serve of lamb biryani and 2 cokes, we couldnt eat it all and almost had to roll ourselves home
4
It is located opposite of a mosque. The portion of the meal is big so can be serve for 2. Much selection of foods.The murtabak is great. The price is cheaper than we ever eat in Malaysia. We ordered many type of foods- but we just pay around SGD 160++ for 26 peoples
5
Martabak at its best. Located just opposite the mosque and named after the famous well. You can see the martabaks being prepared in the kitchen which is at the front of the restaurant

This is a local Indian restaurant at a shophouse opposite a mosque near Arab Street. Tried the deer murtabak and chicken masala and liked it. Will try their briyani on my next visit.

Quiet in the morning. Crispy pratha with teh tarik.

when we finished our meal and walked downstairs, we saw what was without a shadow of doubt, in my opinion, a series of rat droppings on the steps.
never ever will we go here again. never

Zam zam restaurant is a halal indian style place which offers beriani rice, friend noodles among other things. But the MUST try dish is definitely the mutton murtabak ( similar to roti canai but with fillings of your choice). The portion is big so be sure to ask ahead before ordering. Another reason to indulge is because it uses olive oil. Popular with the locals and tourists. Very busy and always full during lunch hour

Being not really a fan of Indian food, a Muslim friend brought me here to try some dishes which I haven't tried yet. I heard that Zam zam is quite famous and I can tell that it's quite a hit, as the tables are all occupied, both ground and second floor. We were led to another place beside it, which seemed like a different restaurant already but apparently is also Zam zam's.The chicken briyani I ordered was apparently good enough for 2 people and I would've finished it if the serving was smaller. My local friends said that the taste is just average though.For the price, can't really expect a nice ambience and if it is packed, expect a slow service

Went here with my friend after being suggested by a local blogger. It has the best murtabak in town and the nasi briyani is fabulous. Dollar to dollar, the price of food here is cheaper than in Malaysia. It is clean, the staff is helpful and there is air conditioning on the top floor. Very near to the Kampung Glam area
4
The murtabak was money. The tables are shared (common in Singapore) thus you will sit with everyone. The place is packed, looks run down a bit, but the food is delicious and it is a great place to start before a couple of drinks in Arab Street

This is the place to hit for cheap, tasty murtabak. I had a small mutton murtabak plus ice tea for S$7-what a deal! My portion could have easily served two or three people.Friendly staff, good food, huge portions. I was there for lunch and saw only locals or Asian tourists-would have expected this to be overrun with the backpacker set....

Recently, while visiting family and friends in Singapore, I decided to try a less conventional way of eating my lunch, you guessed it - with my fingers, literally. To fulfill my childhood memories, I picked Zam Zam Singapore, a South Indian restaurant at North Bridge Road located directly opposite the beautiful Sultan Mosque in Kampong Glam. I've patronized this restaurant many many years ago with my parents when I was a kid. It is one of the best authentic Indian foods around with no fancy tableware or high strung waiters. Still doesn’t. Prior to its recent renovation, it was a dive and food then was also very tasty and cheap.The second floor of the restaurant is now conveniently air-conditioned for those who prefer to eat in comfort and not sweat in the hot and humid climate. Imagine the combination of the spice and heat with high humidity on a hot day while you chow down in cramp quarter? Nice. My family and I decided to order ala carte from the posters posted all over the wall. Or you can visit the food counter on the first floor where most of the magnificent food is on display on trays. From what I recalled, there is no menu, or wasn't given one since we knew what to order. When you enter the restaurant, you are greeted with the wonderful aroma of curry (might be over powering for some), fried chicken, mutton curry, and flat dough bread cooking in olive oil on a flat grill. The cook shows off his skill in kneading, flipping and tossing the prata and murtabak dough. All made fresh when you order. Roti prata is flour based flat bread cooked on a flat grill and served with a light mild curry. It comes either with or without egg. Without egg is called “kosong” prata – means zero or nothing in Malay. The murtabak is another form of thicker soft dough base (like the Italian chicken roll concept) bread that is filled with either chicken, mutton, beef and deer meat, its latest addition. The restaurant also has the bragging rights of being the first in Singapore to serve murtabak cook with olive oil. Healthy. If you are there, you must try the following:1) Both the roti prata and Murtabak. The deer murtabak is slightly pricey at SGD$20 (approximately USD$17) but serves four.2) Chicken Briyani - curry chicken served on top of mixture of white and yellow rice and green pea.3) Lamb Shank Briyani - Briyani is basically a rice-based food cooked with spices, meat like chicken or mutton, fish or vegetables. The rice used is typically the basmati grain.4) Mutton and Chicken Kurma, like a white paste curry that is not spicy at all.5) Chicken Masala (about USD$3 a piece)6) Chicken Liver cooked to perfection with enough green chili pepper.7) Mee goreng – a stir fried combination of vegetable, egg, rice stick noodle in tomato ketchup topped with a fresh lime. All these wonderful dishes were enjoyed without utensils but instead we ate with our fingers!! Yes, we did wash our hands before the meal. It is an Indian and Malay tradition to have meals with their fingers. To us, it was simply a great experience to enjoy the unique way of tasting our food without the usual fork and spoon. Surely, you can opt for the utensil if you find it difficult of awkward. Majority of the customers in the restaurant were eating with their fingers. Remember to complement your food with the local delicious Limau ice juice - a fresh lime based drink served in a cup of ice. Great for cooling off especially when the spice heat hits you and also some drink it to cool off due to the humid weather. However, my children opted for the Bandong drink (a milk and rose flavored pink drink) and Milo dinosaur (a beverage chocolate powder drink topped with several spoonful of Milo served in a cupful of ice too). Some of my family went with the traditional hot ginger tea – which I definitely prefer to pass as it’s hot enough to be downing another hot drink and sweat. Overall, the lunch was beyond cheap as the bill came up to less than USD$40 with that much food and drinks. Although this is not a star-reviewed restaurant, it’s the simple, clean and local’s favorite cozy restaurant you want to pay a visit for an interesting feasting with your fingers!!! (Do wash your fingers after meal!) A wonderful cheap and memorable meal enjoyed with the family.After lunch, if time permits, hop across the road to view the beautiful architecture of the Sultan Mosque and its surrounding shops and restaurants. There are row of shops nearby that sells incredible unique art and crafts, mostly Malay infused theme. One can get good buys for batik, shawl, handicrafts and souvenirs

My personal favourite indian store in sg. But it is always crowded so you must be patient in order to indulge the excellent food.
4
The murtabak is really really good and they don't shortchange you on the ingredients inside. If you haven't tried murtabak, this would be a good place to start.
5
A simple Muslim restaurant opposite the main mosque. Gets cvery crowded and you may need to share a table but for simple dining this place is tops. A lunchtime favourite.

Nice murtabak

I have been passing by this place in the evenings a few times and recently noticed these kind of stuffed pratas on people's tables and it looked so tasty and popular, i went back today to try it - and found out they are called Murtabak. I had the beef one, mmmm! I loved it, it was really tasty, the bread and the sauce were absolutely dilicious! I will definitely be going back for more soon especially as it's down my road! I'm glad i discovered a new kind of food to add on my favs list
5
I am not a fan of murtabak but I really love their mutton and beef murtabak. They were the best I've tried so far that I even had some to eat in our hotel. For the price of each murtabak I never expected that they are that big and full of filling... very generous of them. The service is efficient even they are having a full house when we dined there
3
The service was quite slow although there were not many patrons when we got there around 3pm. Food was OK, not great. My Lamb Briyani was just that - Lamb and Briyani. They provided the dhal-like gravy and acar as condiments. And that was it. At Star Inn restaurant (Little India), the Briyani set (which costs the same, SGD6 for Chicken, and SGD7 for Lamb, Briyani) comes with some vege, popadom and curry
4
I have visited this place since my school days, always crowded during lunch and dinner times. The cuisine served at this eatery is Indian and always good. A varities of curries have always been available unless you visit it during the closing time of their restaurant.Service is fast , prices are most reasonable. A must visit for anyone visiting the Arab street area in Singapore and fancying local Indian food

I had my first REAL curry at Zam Zam’s in 1969 when I was 10. I have had countless Indian meals in 4 continents since then, but will always remember Zam Zam’s for two reasons:1. One evening, whilst having dinner with my parents, the laundrette opposite caught fire and one of the waiters pulled all the curtains down, railings and all in about 20 seconds in order to prevent an ember from the conflagration on the other side of the road igniting Zam Zam’s. We finished our meal whilst watching the fire being doused by a motley crew of fire fighters. It was like a scene from a 'Monty Python' sketch. I remember my father cursing himself for not bringing his beloved Pentax Spotmatic SLR camera that day – he rarely left home without it.2. The food. I know that by now the chefs will have changed so I can't comment on their present cuisine, but I have to this day used Zam Zam’s as a benchmark for every curry I have had since 1969 (conservatively estimated at around 3,000 based on 6 Indian meals a month) and all others have been left wanting. If they still do it and you have an asbestos lined mouth, then try the ‘Blue Juice’. It was awesome. The stuffed parathas were unusual in that they were square, not round and literally melted in your mouth. Another side dish which I have not come across since was a simple portion of cucumber slices covered with a mystery red sauce that I can’t find anywhere.In short, if any of you who read this has seen the film ‘When Harry Met Sally’ and remembers the restaurant scene when Meg Ryan fakes an orgasm and another elderly female patron says “!’ll have whatever she’s had!”, then Zam Zam’s is the closest I’ve ever come to it (no pun intended)

Little more than a hole in the wall opposite the Sultan Mosque on North Bridge road, this restaraunt serves the best murtabak in Singapore.Well known to locals, but rarely visited by visitors it has a great atmosphere and some good food too.Chicken briyani is also good, but the murtabak especially in mutton is excellent, and represents top value for money.For visitors the food is prepared right in the front enclosed section of the streetside restaraunt. A great visual experience for visitors.It is halal, and the place is alcohol free. But do not let that stop you from a great feed
