I went there for their set lunch and would say it's value for money. I ordered the chirashi don and find it really yummy. The chawamushi is super tasty.

I am surprised that this place is so quiet during lunch hours at raffles place area. The set lunch is reasonably priced and food quality is very good too. Great value for money .

Did a family lunch here as the kids loved Japanese food. Food was nice & sitting on the counter was a good experience. You get to chat with the chef's, the kids had fun watching the food being prepared. All added together to make it an enjoyable family lunch. A memorable time for the kids too

We had the whole restaurant with 3 chef and 2 waitress for me and my son on a Sat Omakase lunch only which cost us S$80 per head. There was no Wagyu, no Lamb, no Lobster, no King Prawn, no Crab and no Uni in our 7 course Omakase. What a pity..

Invited to a "simple" business lunch but ended with one of overall best Japanese lunches. We did end up with an Omakase (chef's choice) lunch.Long restaurant layout, pleasantly functional with open kitchen alongside sushi counter and tables and seats also. Service was welcoming and chefs very friendly and helpful - pretty old school head Chef whose worked in Japan, internationally and also from same cohort of current batch of TOP pioneer Japanese chefs in Singapore like Nogawa, Shiriaishi, Aoki etc. Amidst the explosion of new sushi restaurants, Cho has gone for the traditional Kaiseki with a good balance of seasonal cooked and raw foods. Starter of small bites was a fantastic smorgasbord featuring the all delightful stuff - slightly baked uni with prawns and clams in shell, Japanese slow braised Pork belly slice, baby soy marinated firefly squid on shiso leaf, seaweed with grated yam and ikura, deep fried mini crabs etc. I'd order this paired with after work drinks. Nice reasonably priced sake - ask for recommendations if need help. Had a similar spread for sashimi including flying fish (fish, not roe), butan ebi & hotate stack, otoro cubes, greenling, Wagyu sashimi rolls, Uni etc. A fresh and wonderful spread.In between we had a delicious consommÃ© laden with otoro, steamed greenling with carrots and burdock, some sushi of greenling, hotate etc and some pan fired Wagyu slices.We couldn't handle desserts so settled for their own sake based ume wine (one can buy own jar and age with restaurant also) with the ume plum. Current vintage we were told is vodka based for a change.Overall a great experience - will want to go back again, and again. By the way, it was high quality experience but priced reasonably. Not a cheap place but one offering great value for quality of food & service

Wife brought me here to celebrate my birthday. It was empty on a Thursday night, only ourselves and another table of 6. We were seated at the sushi counter and had a good conversation with Chef NELSON. We had the $150 menu, which was done very well. Nelson was able to explain the individual items and prepare the food at the same time. At the counter he also shared that they prepared their own home Onesu brew (see picture) for their customers. It was a good variety of sushi, sashimi, Wagyu beef, stewed Pork with prawn and covered yam. Recommend for return visit.

My friends and I had dinner here on a quiet Friday night (we were the only ones in the restaurant for 2 hours!). We ordered the S$120 meal and were not disappointed at all!Service was fast, efficient and accurate (though not as smile-y as I would have liked!), and the counter seats were great as we got direct interaction with the chefs who explained each dish and details about the type of fish, etc., and fresh sushi placed on each of our plates. For $120, the value was excellent!Every dish was presented beautifully and tasted fresh and succulent. Couldn't be happier with this hidden find and we will definitely be back to try the $150 course

The idea of going for an omakase is scary for 3 reasons. First, you will have no idea what you will be eating. Second, you will not know the $. Third, you don't even know how it all works!Fret not, Cho Omakase will provide the perfect experience for you to lose your Omakase virginity. If you have done it before, Cho provides a local twist that puts you right at home. For those who's worried about the price, you will be able to indicate what you are willing to pay for. Starts at 80++. If you are concerned about the food, that's definitely irrelevant. Cause for someone like me who is very picky. I found all the dishes palatable and going into the unknown gives a certain kick too.The staff are all friendly. The head chef runs a tight ship but never fails to make sure the guests are well fed and enjoying the experience. My favorite part? Watching the art of sushi- making. I was joking that I could watch the chef prepare his masterpiece all day without taking a bite of it!Definitely will head back. Maybe to try the home made wine
