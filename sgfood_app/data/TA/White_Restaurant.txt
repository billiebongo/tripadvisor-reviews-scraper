We ordered a medium size white bee Hoon, the bee Hoon is very fine and flavourful. We like the salted egg prawns, onion omelette and sambal lala too.
5
Lunch time crowds are a challenge but the food was cheap and cheerful. Highly recommended for a quick lunch at a bargain basement price

Bee hoon is fishy n salty. Mee goreng taste only of chilli paste. Not common for us to leave so much food , so u can imagine.
5
Food is fantastic, but i am still giving it a 5 cause the food surpasses the lack of service. The bee hoon is must try!

There is a lot of white bee hoon around and this is still the best. Good value and good reasonably priced food. The parking is difficult and the queue is pretty long as the place is not really big. Go early if you are there for dinner. Or take the free shuttle bus to Sembawang shopping center. The chicken wings are good, the sweet potato leaves dish is prefect and spring roll are tasty too. The jelly dessert is recommended as well

Review by Dr Sim. Good White Bee Hoon dish. A bit expensive. Average ambience. Air-conditioned. Noisy like most Chinese restaurant. Supposed to be the inventor of White Bee Hoon dish. Not a White Supremacist Club. A bit hard for tourists to go to. Regards Dr Si

White noodle are another typical dish of singapore. they taste good, fish taste and lime fragrance. i ate two other signature dishes of the restaurant: prawn and salty eggs, and chicken wings. both good specially the first one. \the restaurant is in a mall, so not great experience. i do prefer restaurants on the road.service was good and friendly

We had a chance to dine in this restaurant a couple of weeks ago when we visited Singapore. The food was excellent. On first impression, the popular white beehon looked pale but it had a lot of flavor. We enjoyed all the vegetable dishes - broccoli, kangkong. Scallops with vegetables were also very tasty.
5
We always come to this place for Chinese New Year Reunion dinner. But you have to queue, no reservations. Go for their signature white beenhoon & prawn paste chicken.
2
The bee Hoon was like fried hock kien mee, wet style.
Prawn roll, chicken wings, fried nai bai were all very salty.
The chicken wings were not well done. Bloody near bones.
I will not come back for this restaurant-Sun Plaza White Restaurant.

Been here twice and the standard is inconsistent. The white beehoon is nice but not something I will travel all the way for. The rest of the dishes were okay. Dont expect too much on good services.

Tasty seafood beehoon from the original restaurant that first started the craze that many others have tried to copy, with variable success. This may not be the best version, but it's apparently the original.

Brought a friend from HKG to try the famous white bee hoon at Sembawang. He said he has heard about it but never have a chance to try it in his previous trips to SG. It took us almost an hour to drive from Holland Village to Sembawang due to the heavy after office traffic (google told us we only need 30mins....) There was still a queue at 7.30pm, but we on,y have to wait about 15 mins as the service and turnaround was quick. Ordered the white bee hoon, fried potato leaves with sambal and prawn roll (hei chou). The bee hoon and prawn rolls were nice but I find the sambal potato leaves a bit too starchy. Price was reasonable. Our bill came up to $27 inclusive of 2 drinks (non alcoholic)...My friend likes the bee hoon and is keen to replicate it at home
2
The white bee-hoon was blend, just like another hokkian bee but blend. Our fried-chicken, ok..it was warm, not hot upon serve and surprise even our little girl mentioned it before we tasted it. The rest of the meal like hot-plate meat is starchy, vege is ok. Verdict: won't go back again,..throwing away food is not an option either. :( Will visit Old House and Ponggol Seafood next door to White in future

Was wondering what to have for lunch and surfed the internet and saw this restaurant and thought might be fun just to kill some time and get lunch. Was expecting long queues but there was none. Seated quickly and ordered the standard meehoon and a side dish of pork prawn roll thing. The meehoon tasted alright. The pork prawn roll lacked crunch. Nothing to scream about. No big deal really. A nice day out nonetheless.

Is it the best or one of the best ?that was the question my friends created in my mind when we talk about seafood or lala bee hoon. so finally I tasted it, well the first mouth was good, then it became normal, maybe due to the hype. But I must say I am used to Nice good lala beehoon one of which I always go for is at Punggol marina. But that closed. to compare the 2 does both the dishes an huge injustice. because they are totally different cooking style. Firstly Sembawang 's version is drier, whereas punggol one is wetter. punggol one is purely lala, while sembawang one got other stuff which give it a totally different taste. Both are good in its own way. So do give this a try to add to your range of local food explore but never compare it. out of 5 I would give it a 3.

We were at Punggol waterways many months back and this restaursnt was packed to the brim. This time, we went back on a weekday and got there earlier than the lunch time crowd. It did not get very crowded as it was a weekday. I wanted so badly to try the famous white beehoon. I still did not to try it but we had the crab bee boon which costs $65/- and the portion was awfully small for a large. The crab was smaller than medium. The "large" crab Bee Hoon was certainly not enough for our family Of 2 adults and 3 children. There are definitely better crab bee Hoon of heartier portion and nice quality in Sinbapore. We had the Salted egg calamari which was delicious and so little. We had the French beans with minced pork, it was yummy but so little again. Glad we got the chance to try the food there but I wish they would increase the quality. The small portion is more like an individual portion. Usually small in this type of restaurant shld be for 2 -3 people to share. Service was very good though.

They have several outlet but I have only been to the one at sembawang which is right opposite the sembawang shopping center. It's tasty and quite special. My mum and I love it with their chili. Tried their lala today and not bad. The outlet I went closed on every Wednesday.

Tasty and delicious Beehoon. That's probably my favorite dish. The rest of the dishes are so so... Luckily, the waiting time is still manageable even during peak dinner time.
5
Ordered the medium sized white bee hoon for 2 person and was just nice, also ordered their baby kailan too! Food was delicious and price is reasonable ($9 for medium sized).
Highly recommended!

This rice vermicelli dish is the signature of You Huak restaurant in Sembawang. The bee hoon had a nice soft bouncy bite with the sloshy yellowish white coloured sauce had beaten eggs added in.
A rich sweet egg savory sauce is their signature taste.
4
You can relish the White Bee Hoon (vermicelli) on it's own. Add Prawn-paste chicken wings, heh3 zhor4 and sweet-sour pork. Order a lime juice to chill.
We prefer the Sembawang branch over Punggol's. Be prepared to queue from between 20 to 50 minutes.
4
Meehun very soft and tasty, visited or take away frequently. My 3yrs son also like to eat. However the due to the long q some time i will give up to eat there.
4
Sister told me that there is a branch in Sun Plaza with air-conditioning. We went there for family lunch. Ordered the fried omelette ( good wok hei ) , white Mee hoon, Brother in law loves the chicken wings and rest of us like the ' hei Chor' and the emperor green fried vegetables. My family enjoys the food much. Will come back for more next time.
3
It was great when I first tasted white bee hoon a few years ago but as it become more and more popular, the quality of the food had dropped significantly. It use to be much creamier and richer but now it is slightly watery. Overall it is still good but isnt fantastic anymore
5
Somewhat of an acquired taste but my family likes the signature white beehoon this restaurant serves up. Other dishes like the Mee Goreng, Stir Fry Fish Head and Bittergourd, Sambal Kang Kong, Prawn Roll are also very good. Prices are not too steep. Make sure you go early on weekends. Queue starts to form from 5pm.

Cozy and vintage-retro style restaurant at Sembawang Sun Plaza. Spacious n courteous staffs. 1. Signature White Beehoon S,M,L (specialty)Small $8, Medium $10, Large $15 (exclude service charge) The White Beehoon quiet delicious with fresh prawns n squids to eat with their unique, spicy n slightly sour chilli. "M" is just nice for 2-3 persons. Not recommended to go during lunch hour to avoid the crowd. 2-3pm should be okay. ThsnksÔºÅ

When the food comes one of our dish inside got afew human hairs so we adk to change to get new dish but the service staff say those hair belong to us. What a lousy service they had and bad attitude most likely never go there anymore. Many people witness it too
1
Will not visit or eat it again. Their service crews suck and waiting time long....
Will prefer toa payoh lorong 4 coffeeshop zi char bee hoon which is better.
3
Been here a couple of times. Another variety of bee hoon served in a different way. In this case, the soup base constitute a lot to the taste. Food wise, taste normal. Nothing to cheer about. Another case of herd's instinct.
4
There is just something special about their white beehoon, it is just, specially good! Not only does it have the necessary wok hei that all zichar should have, the gravy is thick (but not too thick) and addictive. The beehoon is not dry, neither does it become too soggy even if it was takeaway and eaten more than an hour or two later. The chef(s) is/are not stingy with the ingredients either.The meal can be completed with an order of lime juice and ai yu bing - perfect for a weekend Chinese brunch

Good seafood white bee-hoon. The right stove temperature to give it a slightly heated after taste; the seafood is not overcooked. They still retain the springiness especially the squid. The other dish is the deep fried chicken wings, they are a tease to the taste buds.Their prawn noodle is just as tasty.
4
The name says it all - this eatery in a shophouse located in a sub-urban neighbourhood of the northern part of Singapore is best known for its stir-fried rice vermicelli. Try it and you will know why!Their other zi char dishes are just as good, so despite its way out-of-town location, limited parking and long queues up to an hour, it is well worth the effort
5
It looked like any other ordinary seafood restaurant. Then the food came, dish by dish. One mouthful of the white beehoon and I was hooked. It was so oooo delicious. Then came the sambal chilli cockles. Have not tried anything like this before. It's really one of a kind, very different in the way they prepared it.
4
The queue is about 45 minutes long at 9 pm, your order will be taken when its almost your turn to ensure the food is cook and served timely as you sat down. The place is windy as there are a generous amount of fans installed, brilliant for the singapore weather.As for food wise, its a no brainer, the white beehoon and prawn roll is the best. Just look around what the other tables are having, and order those which is chef recommendation and you will not go wrong.Parking might be a problem, but you go in more than two person group, one can queue and the other look for car park

Saw a long queue at a restaurant during my regular gastronomic outing at punggol settlement. It was a branch of you huak restaurant. I decided to pop down to the main restaurant at sembawang. Nothing beats the source.Place is not hard to find with a GPS. Car park however is another matter. So be prepared. Be also prepared to queue, and I was there 20 minutes just after opening time on a Saturday. The place is a non air conditioning coffee shop and seatings are plain and a wee bit tight. I went straight for the famous white bee hoon. Add on dishes included the prawn roll and stirred fried vegetables. These are quite normal in tastes. The bee hoon is another matter. It's topped with prawns and squids. I find the squid tender and chewy but not hard on the mouth. The bee hoon is slightly starchy but when eaten slightly cool runs smoothly in every bite. I rush to munch the noodles when first served and didn't taste the essence until later when it cools down. My mistake. Once cool I can understand the queue factor. Price wise is reasonable. Just a little further sharing, small although the food portion is, it's quite filling. The answer to my own question; Is it worth the trip.... YES

There is always a long queue of people waiting when you want to taste the food there. As early as 4.30pm to 8pm, the people on queue never fails to turn away the people. Why? The food taste good ... When I was in the queue, a woman making noise because she waited for 20 minute to take away her bee hoon. She claims that there are people whom order food later than her, but got them first.When it was my turn to eat in, I realised that the process wasn't quite right with the counter staff. There was people queuing and there was people ordering take away and several times, the people 'blocking' at the cashier will 'pressure' the counter staff to make their orders fast. Thus, those sitting in will get their food later.Well, I'm one of them. I'm a simple traveller but can you imaging that we finished eating the bee hoon, prawn omelette, meat and seafood roll and waited for another 10 minutes and finally, the sweet potatoes leaves arrives? Well, other customers got theirs 15 minutes earlier.If you want to rip in more revenue for the future days, maybe you could relook at the process of serving both sit in and take away customers or consider following the way how Punggol outlet manages..

White Beehoon at Sembawang never fails to please. How can a dish that looks so bland, tastes so good? I dunno but it's slurp-worthy. The fried batang fish, however, was just so-so this time.If you want to avoid queues, best to go after 830 pm on weekdays
