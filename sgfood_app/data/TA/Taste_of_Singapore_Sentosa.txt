You will have a variety of food to choose starting from 6 SGD. Food is tasty and lot of tourists are there all time of the day.

I normally don't review places that I don't like but the food at this place have no taste at all. Singapore food is beautiful and very tasty so this place should not be called "A taste of Singapore"

Good affordable restaurant. Good portions and large selection of Singapore's cultural diversity. Overall good experience.

Excellent food , good ambiance , good quality . worst part is one can't get vegetarian food . Otherwise for non-veg's the variety is ultimate

They have lined up some of the famous Malaysian food at this food street like the Wanton noodle, KL black noodles, Penang laksa, curry noodle & fried noodle, Malacca chicken rice balls, roti Chennai, etc. Not really exactly the same but good enough. There are also some typical Malaysian biscuits like the kaya puff. Price is more pricey than food court but the cheapest eat at resort world so it get crowded during meal times. Serving time is rather fast though some popular stalls may see queues. Disposal Cutlery and at times normal cutlery are available at the cutlery stations spread around this food court. Overall it's a good place to savour some popular Malaysian street food if you are craving for that

Went today by the cabin car. Terrified of height but it was good as I made sure my family doesn't move an inch! SGD$29.00 just to ride a return down to Sentosa is rather oricy. It doesn't include visiting 4D etc. But we decided to walk around the island. The beach is stunning, with the amazing view of cargo ships etc. It must have been over 49 ships which is a pit

It was raining and so we stop here by the halal sign on the door. turn out many food option, with a very fair price, we ordered fried noodle and soup (tomyam) bandung drink and matcha. taste good. its a fine choice among other restaurant, with reasonable price you get to taste the tasty asian meals. attentive and honest staff (we left some money for tipping and they catch us outside to return it, thinking we forget about it

Sentosa's beach walk is great with so many bars and restaurants. We stopped in for lunch as this nice eat in or take away style cafe. It was cheap and cheerful and the food was very good. We loved the curries. Great spot for a quick bite and chilled soft drink on a hot day

I read on a blog before going to Singapore that Taste of Asia offers one of the best tasting Laksa in town, and it did not disappoint. The food was REALLY good and anyone who goes to Singapore MUST definitely try their Laksa. The staff were also all very accommodating, taking the time and effort to explain the food on the menu of which we weren't familiar with. Excellent restaurant, worth every penny! Will go back here when I visit SG again

A calamaris juice or a lemon tea will refresh you and a beef Kway Teow of Pho Noodle will give you energy for the evening activities. In our group of 15 persons, the chicken rise and Pad Thai were the runners up. The kitchen might be a little slow however, the food is tasty. It is easy to move tables so you may sit there with a big group in a relaxing atmosphere

Although there is entry fee, it is enjoyable because of the ferry ride and the many stops on the monorail. The cable car ride was exciting even though scarry
4
Food very good, staff very friendly however we prefered to eat at the Hawkers market at the harbor front (my wife and I have different tastes and the variety suited us there that being the only reason)

A relaxing mode look for Bikini Bar at Siloso Beach, which boasts a colourful design and a cheery vibe, as well as a neat selection of wines, icy beers, cocktails and small bites such as chicken wings, taxos and nachos. We had an event for our department. They blocked the place just for us from 6 pm to 10 pm. Staff were friendly and they had a gigantic Jenga as one of their highlights beside pool table.They serve a good spread of customised dinner buffet if you need any event.I think it is a nice place from sunny afternoon till late night for a glass of wine, mojito or icy beer to keep your mind relaxed

Our second day in Singapore, thought would be nice to try something Singaporean. Should have stuck with KFC like what we planned, food was served cold. It wasn't that bad but, it could have been better. To top it off service was quite bad. Service crew were slow, although polite; could not care less if you need anything else. Definitely Not a Taste of Singapore

Taste of Singapore is located right next to the Images of Singapore attraction on Sentosa Island. We had lunch there after coming out of the Images of Singapore. We were quite excited to find the place since they serve local food and had a couple of dishes we wished to try, including the Singapore Chicken Rice. We also had a side dish of Satay. The Chicken rice was quite nice - apart from the salty soup, the satay was a bit disappointing as the meat was quite dry and hard. The place is more expensive than the mainland restaurants, so we expected better quality. We will not be eating there again

Had lunch on april 2013 with friends. ala carte buffet lunch serves with few and limited choices. fish & chips came with just the hard shell where you can barely able to see the fish at all. the rendang was not as good as I expected, there are too much indian spices in it that makes it concentrated like mud. However their mushroom soup is nice and the drinks are overpriced. The spagetti came with just few tiny pieces of chicken meat almost plain. I doubt mcD nearby would be a better choice instead :

The place is very clean and staff is frendly.The food and drinks are tasty with reasonable price, even I would say a bit higher than those in the town. I had an ice Matcha drink which was a special offer, costed me only 1,8 SGD, which was very nice.Of course, if you want to experience the real taste of Singapore, I still would suggest to go to the town. There you will have much more choices

Had lunch here with my boy as part of his school outing. Comfy and air conditioned. Prices are higher than mainland SG as with all other tourist places. The prawn noodle soup was tad salty n serving is really small. French fries are aa expected. Convenient place right outside cable car station.

Went to Siloso Beach Resort and while looking for food along the beach in the evening, found this restaurant that offers simple and nice food. I tried the Rendang, and it was quite good. Their desserts are also nice and sweet. Overall, a pleasant experience for those who are looking for a good meal to share around the table without burning a hole in your pocket

Went in for lunch while waiting to check into hotel. Tried the beef hor fun, ayam penyet set, spaghetti, fried dou miao and omelette which came drenched in tomato sauce and big juicy prawns on it, young son commented that it looks more like a pizza. Food was tasty though find the spaghetti pretty ordinary and sauce tasted like it came from a jar. Lemon tea also tasted a bit strange but acceptable. Enjoyed the fried dou miao and the omelette as you can taste the "wok" fire in the food. Hubby wipe out the plate of ayam penyet and the beef in the hor fun which my son partake in. Cool and pleasant place with reasonable prices. Located near to the sentosa luge. No complaints with the service staff
