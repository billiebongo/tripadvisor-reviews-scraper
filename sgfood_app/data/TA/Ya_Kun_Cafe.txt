I have been the regular customer of this place. Must try the iced milk tea, it's very nice! Recommended!

Yakun has the nicest kaya toast compared to all the other local coffee joints in my opinion. Their tea is also nice. They blend the tea of you order the iced version.

Their prices have increased so much! Love their
Toasts but coffee is so-so and very expensive compared to the other local stalls.

They have managed to maintain the same quality of toast and coffee. Worth a try though it is slightly more expensive than the cuppa you can get at other Kopitiam.

Like the coffee and kaya toast here. Nice and reasonably priced. There are many outlets nationwide, so its pretty easy to find an outlet near you.

This place has the BEST kata toast in Singapore in my opinion. The coffee is also thick and aromatic. Lovely outlet if not for the
small seating area that fills up quickly. Difficult to get a table so be prepared to share with others.

Best kaya toast in town and it's just in the basement of the hotel where I'm staying. It's very affordable too, you can get a meal at SGD4.80

I had my breakfast here at the Northpoint City branch. The coffee never fail to "wow" me. The eggs are nicely cooked and the steamed peanut butter bread is heavenly. Service is fast and efficient here. I will always have my breakfast here if time permits.

We like coming here for a quick pitstop whenever we visit Parkway Parade. There is a Toastbox in the basement, but somehow the kaya toast seems to taste better here.It can get crowded but you can usually get a table within ten minutes of waiting. Go for the kaya toast set - at $4.80, you get a tea or coffee, a plate of soft-boiled eggs and two slices of kaya and butter toast. Simply heavenly
