Staff was friendly, tea time set was lovely and experience was wonderful. However, there were many items unavailable. Best time to go is before lunch on weekdays for more options.

Cedele is well known for all things natural or organic, since 1997. This Cedele Bakery Cafe outlet at MBFC Tower 3 offers a delicious range of bread, cakes, pies, sandwiches, salads and soup.Out of all their scrumptious cake offering, I particularly dig their decadent dessert carrot cake (western ang moh style) which is moist yet fluffy, and not cloyingly sweet or rich like other types of cake. Their cake slice is of generous portion, and ideal for sharing.My friend had their rosemary chicken sandwich and soup set which is reasonably priced at around SGD13, and presents a satisfying yet healthy lunch. Her small soup was hearty with big chunks of ingredients.I had their artesanally crafted pulled beef sandwiche on ciabatta bread, with succulent and substantial slow-cooked tender pulled beef. Handsdown, one of the best gourmet sandwiches I have ever had in Singapore. You can choose from a few types of bread.My friend's long-black coffee looked and smelt good.Highly recommended if you hanker after consistently great quality and healthy cafe fare at wallet-friendly prices, and are pressed for time. Their service is extremely efficient, although hectic with the lunch-time crowd.There is also a queue for takeaways.I have bought their whole cakes before (carrot cake and velvet cake) which were well received
