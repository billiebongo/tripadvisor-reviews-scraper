Good place to have something meaty from the grill. Steak or Japanese style pasta. Nice ambience with good service. Food is reasonably priced and place is clean and neat.

When we're looking for decent steak in a nice restaurant in Singapore, one of our favourites is Angus. It's not American like Morton's or Singapore style like Jack's but Japanese Western. Rich and good range of cuts available.

- Walking distant is 600m (10mins) from Orchard MRT Station exit via Wisma Atria underground link to Takashimaya - Restaurant located at Takashimaya Shopping mall @ level 4 near the toys department- Visited on Sunday evening, it was not as crowded. - Staffs was friendly & helpful with the recommendation.- Go for the set meal (just add an additional of $15) that comes with bread, a salad, a soup, a main dish & a dessert. It was worth the money.Overall: It was good in terms of staff services, food & price. Important Note:It can be very crowded during the weekend. Reservation in advance is recommended.

Ambience is nice and service is really good. We ordered 1 steak set and 1 fish & chip. They gave us an additional piece of bread. Portion size of soup and salad of the set was large enough for sharing for small eaters. The steak was really done well. My medium steak was not too raw or too cooked for my taste. The sauce/ butter was arranged so that I can spread it out as I like and the steak taste fine even without any. Fish & chips taste fresh and the chips(fries) were just freshly fried (golden and hot).Would come back again for sure. When we arrive we saw a number of families with toddlers and children. Seems very family friendly.

Had an early dinner there to satisfy a red meat need. The wagayu tenderloin was an excellent cut and cooked to perfection. Side dishes are limited and most diners seemed to go for the 'set meal ' options with soup and deserts, which are ok if you want quantity over quality
3
If you‚Äôre into red meat, this may be your sort of place. We are not big fans but thought we will check it out. In the event, we tried a steak, some risotto as well as some fish. They have a good deal where for $15 more, you can upsize to a meal that has starters, soup and dessert. It‚Äôs a good deal. But overall the non-steak menu was so-so (a bit bland) and the fish was just okay. But the steak was alright.
4
Premise is nice. Spacious and plenty of seats but then again it's a weekday.On the 4th floor of Ngee Ann City, closer to Takashimaya side.Food was good. Set dinner was ended with a small speck of Tiramisu but still ended with a smile. Steaks were good and service was with smiles and good greets. Good for once in a while dinners and good to spend some Dosh on impressive 1st dates.
5
Compared to other Steak Houses, the steaks are would be consider petite, but it's just the right portion for must Asian. Staff are friendly and attentive, steaks are well cooked to order, sides and others on the menu are good too. I'll always come back, mostly also because the price are good too
5
My family and I have been going there for our steak fix almost every month. The ambience is excellent and the service is prompt and perfect. The steak is done and highly recommend you go for the set inclusive of appetizer, entree and dessert. The bread toast looks like a robot and is hot and crispy. Must try
5
This place is over 20 years old. Its consistency always amazes me. Impeccable service. Juicy steak! Highly recommended.
3
It's been a while since I've been here. Food is consistent.
Known for their steaks although I actually prefer their fusion pastas cooked Japanese style. Interesting and very tasty.
Reasonably priced overall but I would rather pay a little bit more for better quality.

After Shopping whole day need a place for lunch, and we found a wonderful place for dinningüç¥üçΩ..

Thank you üòä

Located in one of the many malls on Orchard. Nice interior. I had a New York strip that was quite tasty. Salad had a Japanese-style dressing which I thought was quite good, though some of my colleagues thought it was strange. We had the set menu which comes with appetizer, salad, and dessert. Yum.
4
experience was pleasant. they even gave a complimentary bday cake as i was there to celebrate my husband's bday.my husband ordered a medium rare steak. Bt steak was quite well done when served. However, they were quick to replace with another. Will def visit again! :)

I decided to drop by at the steakhouse as I was looking for a place to have lunch. I was quite impressed by the seats next to the floor to ceiling windows which I could admire the Orchard Road Scene. The ambience is nice and calm. It seems to be a favourite with families as I saw a few families having lunch here. I really enjoyed the set lunch and the bun was fantastic! It was crispy on the outside and really soft inside! The soup was Crab Meat Chowder which I find it tastes really yummy! I love the salad with the Japanese dressing. The steak was tender and it literally melts in my mouth! Oh the dessert is superb! I love the way it was presented! I would highly recommend this place to lunch goers who have the time to just laze and chill while watching the people and vehicles waltzing pass Orchard Road. The price is affordable but yet it's fine dining value.

Discovered this place, very Japanese flavour but with a good steak menu. Scent of sesame whilst waiting for the main course made us wonder if the meal would be Asian or western. In the end the steaks were perfect, mine a sirloin med/rare, my partner a butterflied filet mignon. Perfectly cooked, juicy and tender with more than enough fries to complete the meal. What more could we ask, the set menu offered enough accompaniments and dessert. Surprisingly good for an odd location in a shopping mall.

My husband treated his friends and myself to this restaurant back in July some time, though we went to the branch somewhere in Bugis. It was located inside a shopping mall, and was a bit difficult to find at the beginning. We were quickly shown our seats as my husband made a reservation. My husband and myself had steak (could not remember if it was sirloin or not), his friends had the other meat steak in the menu, while one of the friend's daughter had the chicken burger. In my view, the steak was tender, nice cut, and just right to the taste. The only downside is that it came with a huge portion of fries, will be great if it can be substituted with other much healthier options, such as the salad or the coleslaw, just like what McDonalds restaurants do. Can consider going back to this place on special occasions

We are a family of 7 which includes seniors and a baby. A local friend recommended this Japanese-Western restaurant. Which was a great recommendation because my baby is allergic to several foods and rice is the safest choice when travelling. The rest of us could enjoy western dishes in this restaurant while baby has his rice.After a long day at Gardens by the bay, we arrived at the restaurant at 9 pm. It was very difficult to get a taxi by the way. We were relived to see the sign at the mall entrance: "Mall closes at 10 pm. Restaurants on 4F close at 11."True to our friend's word, the food was indeed tasty. We had several pastas, cod and steak. Everything was good except the appetizers served with the meal. Which was a sort of fish too dry for me to recognize. However, the service left much to be desired. Maybe it was late and the waiting staff was tired. The manager took our order and she neglected to note who's having what. She came back to ask and still forgot. The waitress who then brought the food got really impatient when we tried to explain she set the food down with the wrong person. Hey we didn't do the table setting, don't take it out on us!After the main courses arrived, we waited and finally had to ask for the rice. The first waitress said she would check, second one did too, and then a third waitress checked and came back to say there's no more rice. Errr... when we ordered, the manager said we had to specify rice or bread. We ordered rice. Now... Just 2 words "sold out" after we waited and waited?So I put on my dissatisfied customer fake smile and told the manager my baby was counting on the rice. Please help us and bring us rice for the baby to eat. The manager did come through and brought 2 plates of rice. (Side note: Rice was haphazardly piled on the plate - never seen presentation like that in a Japanese restaurant.)And then it was the manager's turn to put on the fake smile. At 10:20, she told us she would give us 10 more minutes to finish our meal. Restaurant was supposed to close at 10. Oops my bad. Should not have assumed the mall sign applies to all restaurants on 4F

My family and I visited the restaurant for the first time and we had a enjoyable meal there! As I've made a reservation, we were given a table located by the window and the view was great. My family enjoyed the tranquility of the restaurant too. Service crew was prompt in getting our orders and acceding to our requests. I ordered a sirloin steak and upgraded it to a set meal. It was done just to my liking. My 7 year old daughter loved her children's steak too! The dessert was my favourite tiramisu and It didn't disappoint me at all. Despite the more than average bill, I guess we will be back again on special occasions.
5
Excellent service and excellent food!!! Love my medium rare ribeye steak done so perfectly!! Just love the quality of food though prices abit steep. But definitely worth the visit!!
5
Meal: delicious tenderloin steak cooked to a turn. Perfection.
Atmosphere: Quiet, peaceful, calm (on a Monday evening)
Service: Attentive without imposing, professional, all with a smile and greeting
3
Fairly basic steak- cant critique too much though by a long shot not a great stake. Sides pretty mediocre as well as very limited beer list
5
Used to go there very often last time but stop for quite a long while as there are just too many new places to try in Singapore.Went back for lunch and think the food is still as good as last time. Ordered a Sirloin and it is delicious ... Keep up the good workThe place is a bit quiet compare to last time but I guess not much advertising
5
Located on the 4th floor of Takashimaya Department Store, near the sports section, I had passed by the restaurant on numerous occasions but had never went in as it looked rather nondescript. However, upon a friend's recommendation, I decided to drop by for lunch.I had the 150g Tenderloin for lunch, done medium rare. Other than being a tad salty, it was a good steak. What I especially like was having the 150g option. Most restaurants I came across did not offer such a small size. At SGD52++, it's not exactly cheap. However, the restaurant offered the option to upgrade to a full set lunch. For an additional SGD10++, the restaurant offered a soup, bread or rice, a salad, and a dessert. The soup of the day was the mushroom soup, but I was also given the option to select another soup, which I did with the minestrone soup.Definitely worth a revisit
3
This restaurant is a regular one which my family must have dinner when we are in Singapore. This dinner didn't impressed at all because my daughter's spaghetti came after my steak 15 minutes. Obviously, the service/lead time of the cooking need to be improved. Food 5/5Service 1/
4
Adding S$10 to have a complete lunch meal on top of the main course is definitely worth it, soup of the day, refreshing salad and spoilt of choice for the desertPumpkin soup is great, salad is fresh and green, tiramisu (my wife took mango sobert) is right to complete the mealWe had lamb grill and mixed seafood grillLamb is fantastic, not too strong seasoning and grilled to the perfectionHowever, the mixed seafood is kind of disappointing, prawn is kind of small (stated as King Prawn), not really fit the description of King, scallop is slightly less fresh as I expecting, squid is great.Very friendly staffs, always attentive to what we needEnjoy the atmosphere, quiet (not sure is due to Tuesday), my wife certainty enjoyed her birthday lunc

Starter: Thread fin fish on a bed of mashed potato with caviar on topBest bun! Soft and very warmCream of mushroom soup - good, not heavySirloin steak - good, just as I want it. Far better than the one at Wooloomooloo Corn on the cob - Super lousy, tasteless & hard. Tasted better with a dash of salt but still not good enoughGuava mousse - nic
4
The seating inside the restaurant is nice and quiet for conversations. Ordered the Tenderloin and Ribeye steak. Meat quality is good. You can choose to top up the meal to a set with salad, fish, and soup, which could be filling if you are a big eater. I would recommend this place if you do not mind decent steak with a pricier tag
4
Service was relatively prompt and quite good (the servers seemed a little blur at times).The A4 wagyu had great marbling, and the portion came extremely huge. My wife couldn't finish her portion. Also, top up an additional $12 for an appetizer, soup, bread, salad and dessert to complete the dinner.P.S. the Rusden 2007 was mine, we paid corkage for it (IIRC - $20
4
We ordered the simple Wagyu and the Lamb chop steak . Overall good meat quality, good taste, nice ambiance and responsive service all the time. Recommended place for steak lover in Singapore
5
food was excellent, make your pasta a set lunch (includes soup, salad, dessert) by adding $20 , fantastic deal, the portions were generous too, value for money and exquisite taste
3
Food is average. Steaks here - nothing to talk about. Service is below average. Price is not in line with the quality of the food. Maybe it contributes to the high rental at Ngee Ann City.
5
I went there with my husband on his birthday. We ordered 2 dinner set followed by 2 wagyu beef and 2 bottles of wineThe steak was real good.The bill was above 500$ but it Worth every cent I paid For sure I'll be back
4
It was a rainy day...my wife and I were caught in a storm....we were both very hungry and couldn't find the place we were looking for. Right across the street from where we were stuck was the Angus Steakhouse. It looked like a tourist trap, but we were so hungry that we decided to try it anyway. Once inside, I was a bit surprised by the layout and decor.....it reminded me of Chili's. The second big surprise was the food....my wife had ribs and I had a burger.....both were excellent. I must admit that this was not what I was expecting...from the outside it screams tourist trap....on the inside its a pretty nice place for lunch
4
Tried this place on a business dinner and decided to go for the Wagyu 300g sirloin which was S$152 before taxes. Tasty but I not sublime like the steak at CUT or even Bedrock Grill which we couldn't get a booking at. $13 set top up from soup, bread and salad is pretty decent value though
5
We started patronise this restaurant some 20 years ago when my daughter was just 2 years old. She is 23 now. The restaurant is family friendly. Great service staff. We used to meet the Japanese Chef there and he always complimented the kids with their favourite tiramisu. We love everything on the menu but our favourite is still the steak. Compared to other steak house, Angus House is definitely value for money
5
Angus steakhouse serve high quality of juicy and tender steaks. You cant go wrong with their tenderloin. Their complimentary break are fresh too. But the way they serve the steak on the plate is quite plain, maybe they can give a better decoration on the plates. Just that the prices are quite pricey..
1
We tried this restaurant this evening the menue was very limited. We also explained to the server that our son had an egg allergy and she said she would let the chef know. We ordered garlic bread for our son and when it came he took one bite and became very unwell. I informed the staff but they were disinterested at best. While my son was in the toilet where my son was very sick they brought his main meal and guess what there was coleslaw on the plate as well as the ribs and chips. I was very annoyed that after telling the server they still seem oblivious to the risk they are putting their dinners at. If they dont know or understand whats in the food then the shouldnt be serving it. The food in general was very expensive and not worth the money. Take your buisness somewhere els

One of those "need a steak" nights while travelling for work. This place was across the street so headed over.Good selection of solid grub... Not too fancy and not too many pages.Same goes for wine list, though I just had a Tiger.Fast service. Steak was cooked as asked.I think the sides are a bit pricey although they do offer a salad based upgrade at a cheaper rate... I needed some mash however.Decent meal... A bit pricey for 2 sides as there was not much else on the plate.Not a place I'd take a client but ok for a quick feed
4
Food was excellent! The service could have been better. They took 20 mins to bring another piece of bread. While they didn't do anything wrong, they certainly didn't stand out.
4
Nice ambience despite being atop a department store. Steak was beautifully tender and cooked to perfection. Appears a little expensive from menu price but for an extra S$12 you get appetiser, soup, salad and dessert thus overall not bad value at all. Very enjoyable meal!
3
Really, you would have thought a steak house would have been able to cook a medium rare steak, it's not rocket science, but this was too hard for this place
2
We were both jet lagged and looking forward to some nice ribs and perhapsa soup. The menu showed it all. So we waited to be seated and waited and waited. No one there. The restaurant had approx 10 patrons. We eventually took our own seat. For about 10 minutes i tried to get the attention of a couple of guys and a girl scurring around but doing nothing. It was about 8pm so it wasnt as if they were closing. I went inside to ask for a menu and a wine list. I got the wine list but no menu. So we sat and sat and sat and started to laugh as we thought they just did not want to serve us. So we got up and left and went in to the restaurant next door. What a pity as i was looking forward to what i had in mind. If this is what it is like out in the front of the restaurant...I cannot even imagine what it would be like in the kitchen and if the food would be fresh or not. I have looked at some of the reviews and have seen comments like Good steak and service, fantastic steak....just wondering of you had to cook yourself!!? We moved next door and even then we did not attract the Angus Steakhouse staff to keep us. The restauarant next door (Italian) was busy, friendly..we were seated in no time and looked after. Sorry Angus steakhouse...you lost out
5
Another Happy visit to my favorite Singapore steakhouse.The fillet steak with lobster tail is pricey, but very good and the potato soup is always a winner, simple and tasty, with an Excellent Argentinian Malbec wine to wash it all down. The apple pie is just the way Mama made it, so just perfect.Friendly and attentive service, so full marks from this long time satisfied customer

My boyfriend and I visited Angus Steakhouse on Valentine's day (14 Feb 2015). There was a V day fixed menu and you can select your steak to go with it. I took Joshu Wagyu Sirlon Steak 200g whilst the boyfriend had Tenderloin steak 300g. I would say that altho the tenderloin steak being much cheaper, it was better than the Joshu Wagyu. The bill was near SGD300 but dinner was good. The valentine dishes were so beautifully decorated and delicious. There were two timing for the V day dinner and we took the earlier slot that starts at 6pm. The other timing was at 8pm. Altho being fully seated, service provided was good. Will definitely go back for the tenderloin steak again
2
We were walking around Orchard Road and ended up in Takashimaya Department Store and decided to look for something to eat for dinner. We found Angus here and was attracted. They were only serving Valentine's Day menu that night. The place looked good so we decided to try.The plating of the food were aimed to be fine and i think they still have some ways to go to be there. The staff were not familiar with the product and definitely not with the wine. They had to go back and forth to ask the chef about the menu and could not even pronounce French Merlot correctly. As a steak house (they had an award displayed at the entrance), i think it is appropriate to know about wines you are selling. It was still ok until the food was started to be served. All the food was cold. Felt like it was reheated (even not properly) and then served to us. There was a strand of hair in my appetiser: scallop shrimp in cream served in a tangerine topped with cheese. They changed it but actually it dropped my appetite by half. The violet soup was good. The biggest problem was the steak, it smelled like fridge! The cooking level was correct but the smell was like it has been stored in freezer for long time without cover. Literally. I even asked my fiancee is it was ok to eat this meat as it smelled like rotten. Never had a steak like this before. The dessert was ok but when we were having it, a waitress (I think the restaurant manager cos she was wearing a black ladies suit) approached us and said "Im sorry sir but we are closed already, just to let you know" and then stopped the background music right away, and all the waitress stood 5 meters away from our table and chit chat and looked at us, waiting for us to leave. That was the rudest service ever since what they should normally do is to inform us that they were closing and ask if we would like to have last order. But this one was saying we are closed, get out. You really need to consider to come here. Maybe it is better to go elsewhere
3
I think the title says it all. The staff are often clueless and have been for years. But despite the pain of dealing with them the baby back ribs are the finest money can buy, and I say this with great care. Tony Romas has nothing on these guys. Zip
5
Went with a few co-workers and this place does the word Angus proud. Though I was the only one to have steak, I tried the Australian Wagyu Rib-Eye, and it was cooked perfectly, and the flavor amazing. The seasoning was light to allow the steak to stand on its own. I expected a little more marbling in the meat, but it was an great cut, and without a doubt, one of the top three steaks I've ever eaten, and I'm quite a steak snob. Can't say enough about how tender the meat was, and how well cooked it was (I went medium since I'm overseas, though I usually go medium rare and I wasn't disappointed a bit). The vegetables were excellent, though I didn't care for their salad, as the quality of greens used I was a bit let down by. But the dessert, bread, and everything else was great The lead hostess/server was very attentive, professional, and quite social with us which was a surprising delight. If you want a great steak, this is the place for you. My co-workers had the chicken pot pie, the chicken, and a seafood platter with lobster, and all of them said their food was excellent also
4
We have eaten here several times, usually together with friends, who love to eat a good piece of meat. Like last night, the staff is always friendly and willing to help and explain the different menus. Up to now, the meat has always been done just the way we requested it. The additional dishes are not always hot, not even the French fries. But then the choices of drinks to choose from makes up for that. We will go back again, just for the medium well done different steaks and the delicious fish and being able to stable the table
5
Service and quality is ok, the balance price quality is excellent, the hospitality is optimal and no waiting time.
5
best steak ive had in years.definitely beat the one we have in indonesia. great steak pretty expensive but relatively a fair price set meals include soup bread and appetizer only on dinners. Should try it anyway
4
Always have some special going with meat and lobster at reasonable prices. Good sized meals for little overpriced menu items
4
great food and service. The atmosphere is pleasant and the staff helpful. location is very good and dont miss their steak
3
Wonderful meal and ambience. Top it off with friendly service. My wife recommends the ribeye n onion rings!
writing this review, makes me hungry again!
3
Simply annoyed when we repeated asking for bread and required 3 service staffs to do so. The reason behind I wrote this was the servers were so rigid that they cannot serve the bread if soup is not served? How stupid can the restaurant or the servers reaction can be. It is also shown how the management run the business. There is simply no flexible to their process.

Kids wanted steaks after a weekend walkabout around Orchard, so decided to head over to Angus. First time for me although have heard alot of this place. Tug away at a quiet corner of Orchard, its a good place to wind down with family. Went for the rib-eye; overall was OK. Meat was done well to my liking i.e. medium rare; and servings were generous. Enjoyed the dinner because of the quiet dining which is a rarity in Singapore these days
1
Overpriced, ordered only entrees due to the extortionate prices which were huge plates of greasy fried foods, not at all what we expected, and feel the waitress taking the order should have told us that it was going to be far too much food for 2 people (including a teenage girl). Left feeling hungry but sick having blown $80. Rubbish !!
5
The food here was excellent! The prime rib just melted in my mouth and the flavor was delicious! The service started out really good, but then became nonexistent. We ended up waiting for 30 minutes after our dinner and then asked for our dessert to be put in a take away box. It was just too annoying to wait any longer
4
A steakhouse with a Japanese twist. Service was very good and friendly, and they were great with my 4-year old. The place has a Japanese flair and influence to it (the service staff were in maid uniforms!), so expect a slightly different palette than what you'd get at a normal steakhouse. That being said, the food was very good and the steaks were nice and tender. It is on the pricey side, but a nice experience overall
5
Friendly staff and good food. Seating inside with AC or outside al fresco with some smoking tables as well.
2
Bad quality, fatty meat and poor, slow service. Lots better options in the area and city. Non steak options were better
4
pricing , especially drinks on the high side // anyhow - friendly served - good steak really "medium" as asked.
4
Very near our hotel Hilton Singapore! Lovely to sit outside in the very warm Pulsing Singapore City! We will recommend Angus on Orchard Road
3
quick and friendly. good location. choice inside or outside dining. will go back again when back in Singapore
5
Had a great ribeye steak here. Cooked medium-rare to perfection. just the way I like steak, nicely browned on the outside but dark pink in the centre. Not expensive either, at least not by Singapore standards!
3
The mains prices are up there with the high end places, they do have a $12 add on that includes entree soup salad bread which is worth it but the meals are very simple steak S$65++ before the extras. We were charged for chips we didn't get. For Aussies watch the Singapore ++ (extra 17%) when you look at menu's it sneaks up on you especially when it comes to the very expensive wine
3
Good service, good steak. Nothing overly special. It is nice to sit on their patio and people watch. Prices are not bad. The filet was not seasoned well, good cut of meat, but nothing to bring out the flavor. Prime rib was good but nothing to write home about. The lobseter tails were over done.
5
This is a must visit each trip to Singapore, the steak is the best I have ever had. The staff are always happy to help with any requirements also. From time of ordering to receiving the meal is also really good so you are not sitting around waiting

My elder sister from Jakarta invited us to this restaurant for dinner on last Friday, as her only son was attending a wushu tournament in Singapore from last Thursday to Saturday early evening. The friends of her son, one of the parents and the 2 coaches of the son also joined us for the dinner. With the exception of the son, who had seafood risotto, the rest of us all had the set menu. The starter was either baked fish or baked chicken. As I was allergic to seafood, I chose the chicken. The chicken was tender and nice. The soup was either pumpkin soup or sweet corn soup, and we all chose the sweet corn soup, which was really creamy and melted at the mouth. The green salad was also crispy and tasty. The steak that I had (a 150 g) was well cooked, easy to cut and with the steak, it is enough to fill your tummy. Guys are recommended to order the 250 g steak though. There is a variety of dessert to chose from: the strawberry shortcake (I am not a great fan of cakes), tiramisu (they looked really nice, though my husband complained that the portion was really small) or ice cream. I chose the strawberry ice cream, which was really nice. In my opinion, the ice cream was not too sweet and the scoop was not too big. We did not have any tea or coffee as you have to pay top up for adding this, as the cost of these is not included in the set menu itself. The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice, and I noticed family and friends like to come to this place for special occasions such as birthday parties. I never know that this restaurant existed, until my elder sister introduced me to it. Will definitely come back to this restaurant again in the near future

i have been to this place more than 10 times in last 3 years but I think beef quality of rib eye is not good as before.
4
Excellent quality and very friendly and efficient service and within easy walking distance of the Orchard Hotel and sitting outside you can just watch the world (or in this case S'pore) go by
4
Ribs are amazing!! Not cheap though sadly as located on the popular Orchard Road. Ate al-fresco which is lovely but meal for 3 including a couple jugs of Tiger beer cost us ¬£100
3
Restaurant in a hotel. Looks run down. Food is ok even if passed off as American. Had a steak and just ok. There must be other places that does better. The price is ok
5
I am not much of a steak lover but I LOVE TO EAT STEAK HERE! No knife needed....use your fork to cut your Waygu Filet.... So wonderful! You get salad a side and dessert. Rather than super expensive ala cart... It's a bit pricey but ohhhhh so worth it! On Orchard Rd in Tachimaya Mall (sp) 5th floor. Yummmmm
4
I visit this restaurant every time I visit Singapore and it never disappoints. Try the deep fried onion to start with and then move onto any of the superb steaks; if you‚Äôve room for desert then wow you‚Äôve more great choices. I recommend sitting inside rather than out due to the humidity ‚Äì but hey you may prefer it outside. Restaurant offers good value for what is a western styled menu and meal
4
Visited Angus Steak House on Sunday 9th of June 2013. I followed their recommendation and was served a good rib eye steak. The dish came with a green salad and was served in a few minutes. All in all - a good dinner that set me back some S$100. More than enough.
5
I was a bit on the weary side when we first walked in to this restaurant. The lady seating us seemed to have a problem because we did not want to sit where she was going to place us. I brushed it off and since then everything was tops. Our waiter was awesome, got our meal correct to the T. Food was amazing, made me miss my home in Texas. This is an authentic steakhouse and will be back.
3
Quite a well known place for steaks. Steak prices ranged from $40+ to $60+, depending on the size and cut. Just go for the largest cut because of the value-for-money. The top-up was also cheap; $10 for bread, soup, starter, salad, and dessert. The bread was good, the soup disappointing, the rest average.At least the steak was done pretty well, and it was extremely tender. The Japanese sauce appeared to be a mixture of radish, Japanese soya sauce, and probably some miso - and it was a welcome change. But I found the lime and butter quite unnecessary, as it seemed to clash a bit with the steak.Service was poor. The service staff were not rude, but were very inexperienced. They either fumbled when serving us, or did not seem to know where to place our bread and starters. For this kind of place, this kind of service was inexcusable
4
I've been eating in this restaurant for the past 18 years, and I always leave with a satisfied stomach after every visit. The restaurant is situated on the 4th floor of Takashimaya aka Ngee Ann City, beside the Sports Golf Shop & opposite Crystal Jade Chinese Restaurant.For a start, I love their Soup of the day (be it Pumpkin soup, Carrot soup, Seafood chowder, crabmeat soup, etc), the Japanese salad with appetising vinegar, and the various types of appetisers. As for the main course, I enjoy their dishes such as Rib Eye, Tenderloin Steak, Lamb, Scallop on grilling stone, Sea Urchin & Abalone Spaghetti, Grilled Seabass, Their dessert, Tiramisu, is one of the best I've eaten. I'll always complete my meal there with their aromatic, strong coffee with some crystallised brown sugar

Stayed near this place so decided to visit them for a Fri Chill out session with my friends. My steak was well done and good place to wind down after a week.
5
Staff well trained / brief , that what's customer service is all about when guest step into the restaurant
3
if you like to eat good steak it's a good place little problem that some dishes on the menu are not available but price is ok
5
Had the best steak dinner here in ages. Its not cheap but very few restaurants of this caliber are in Singapore, but the food is cooked perfectly and the service is excellent.
3
For $97 i would expect hot fresh food. Fries were cold and battered onion was held over and also cold. Ribeye steak was ok not worth such a high price.
2
Very small portions and expensive for what you receive. convenient located in hotel lobby. Atmosphere was pleasant. booths comfortable.
5
If you love a good steak cooked to perfection this is the place to be. Dine inside or out and if you are a smoker they cater for you as well.

Hidden in Takashimaya aka Ngee Ann City in the first part of Orchard Road (THE shopping street in downtown Singapore). It actually faces the main street via its windows. You wouldn't know as most shopping malls have artfully designed facades. Recommended by a friend. Quality is variable. Liked it alot the first time, wasn't so great the second time. Nice theme with a piano but have not heard it being played. Tables look good until you get close-up and you can see lots of scuff marks and minor amounts of detritus on the cushions. Price is ok considering current levels of inflation. If you are after cheaper fare, try Ashtons (steak), or any hawker centre. Good thing is that the ambience is usually fairly quiet/not too noisy - good for resting after a day of shopping

Good place for steaks done exactly as you ordered. Had tenderloin ($47++ for 150 g) and son had Wagyu ribeye ($100 ++ for 200 g). In most places, medium rare usually turns out rare but here, the steaks were beautifully cooked. Served with what seems like a tiny portion of sauce, but turns out to be more than enough! It is worthwhile to add an extra $10 to get the set menu which gives appetizer (ours was spring roll and prawn with apple mayo), soup (cream of carrot, yummy), salad and dessert (tiramisu or ice cream). Service was fast and efficient (like a well-oiled machine). No wonder, as this place has been around for more than 15 years

Had their ribeye. Beautifully cooked but the downside was they served me cold onion rings. God knows how long that thing been sitting on the fry basket. Wasnt impressed with their coleslaw too. Practically drowned the cabbage with the dressing. Expect at least 50 per pax here.
2
Food was average , service mediocre and all in all quite a disapointment
4
Exactly what it says, nice steak house, good value.
5
I already tell you about morton's how bad is the quality. Save your 200 dollars at this place than at morton's!
5
Huge steaks so have a huge appetite when you visit and you won't be disappointed. The potions are huge and the choice of meals unbelievable.

I ate in Angus Steak House many time in the past - and I was most of the time happy with the food. I usually have a Sirloin / Tenderloin steak and a glass of red wine, and enjoy sitting outside and view the action on Orchard Road. Though I always shake my head about the prices - this is a Singapore phenomenon and not really related to this restaurant
4
Sitting inside or out, Angus is a good steak house. Food is prepared the way you like it. fast service and the atmosphere is pleasant. The only drop is the "√èced Tea"which has had a habit of being old on many occasions when I have had the pleasure of dinning here. Minus the tea, excellent steak house! Keep it u

I ate here looking forward to a big juicy steak. I asked for it to be cooked rare and I was presented with a freezing cold steak with was just sealed on the outside... I returned the dish and asked for it to be cooked further as it was freezing inside. I received no apology, no discount and was left unable to finish my meal.Do not go here if like me you love steak

This restaurant has been around for a while and it feels and looks it, - in terms of furniture, design and staff attitude. Don't get me wrong ..the steak choices are great ..the quality of the steaks served was beyond reproach ..but everything else is 'tired'. Whats missing is a bit of fizz in this place; the all-male staff are functional at best ...they are just doing their job - but it a change of crew would be a good idea ..why not bring in a few nice looking waitresses with a smile and a better attitude, change the lighting and freshen up the layout ..then the prices would be more justified. For those on a business budget its an ok place, but for private dinners it lacks atmosphere
3
The appertisers are good value, but the steak and drinks ae not worth the money. The steak cuts are too fatty for this type of prices, and the service and options for accompanments are limited. Not even able to have a seeded mustard. Just yellow only...?? Sauce options are also very limited and not high end quality

I had a fish and chips on 3rd March 2012. I was staying in Hilton and decided to try it out. Though I arrived a bit late for lunch it seemed the people are not very interested to serve the guests.The lady at the counter did show me a seat and took my orders.It took them 15 mins to serve the order which is acceptable. All the while the lady at the counter chatted with a colleague loudly.The food was average. I had better fish & chips elsewhere. I also ordered for a choclate ice cream. The icecream was extremely frozen and so I left it halfway.Overall not a great experience as the staff was busy chatting rather than serving customers. Definitely I had better experience elsewhere in Singapore

Good quality steak! Great ambience and service! Will be one of my main stays for steak!
3
Watch the menu and what you can eat when, they limit the basic meals to only a few hours.
5
Excellent Steak but pricey
4
this is the one @ Taka i think. What can i say...try it for yourself. The wagyu steak is really something different...
3
Ok Steak restaurant. Steak quality is good....but why the heck serve it on a hot platter???? ruins the steak.
4
Tender tenderloin steak with tiny Japanese cut veg. I like Angus and the one in KL is not bad too.
3
Love the high-class ambience and good services. The steak is juicy but the rest is a tad too fusion for me.

Having read so much about the legendary Wagyu/Kobe Beef, I decided to visit Angus. The ambience was relaxed. The cutlery was interesting - My steak was served in a well worn brass plate that looked a hundred years old. I had read so much about what to order from other travellers and I tried Fresh Live Oysters for starters and they were great - with a slice of lime, chilly plum dip and Japanese Soy sauce with Radish.I also tried the Wagyu Rib eye Steak (200 gms) which was priced at S$ 90. The steak was unbelievable soft . Not sure if it was the best beef in the world. I also tried the Tiramisu which was out of the world and found myself salvaging the crumbs that remained (on and off the plate).There isn't much of a selection if you want to order wine by the glass. I tried a French Merlot and a Reserve wine (unable to recall name) that were around S$ 10 per glass.The service was adequate - no complaints. Tips are included in the bill. Be prepared to shell out about US $ 110 per head.The Restaurant is at Tree top level on Orchard road and around Sun set you will see thousands of Mynahs flying past the window like jet fighters. I am more likely to remember the Mynah birds streaking past the window more than the taste of Wagyu Beef

So my husband & I had heard raves about this restaurant and being from Texas we thought we had to give it a try considering we have lived in Singapore for 2 1/2 years and not gone. So off we went. We decided on inside seating due to the weather in Singapore, but sweated through the entire meal. When we asked our server about the temp she stated there was nothing she could do that others had complained too, but sorry! The service was slow & subpar and the food was forgetable! We won't be back

Angus was my favourite steak house before I discovered Morton's but it still without a doubt can hold its own. For its steaks are simply different from others. If you aren't a fan of the steaks at Morton's, aren't a beef connosieur or are after something more asian, then I'd highly recommend Angus.The dinner steak sets are a real treat. One gets a bread roll, soup, salad, hor's doerves, steak and dessert. And its all simply fantastic. However, I'll concentrate on the steak. The steaks here are different, because of Angus' special sauce that is poured over it. I won't pretend to know whats in it, but its simply fabulous and addictive. I can almost taste it now just writing this review!So head on down to Angus if you're in the mood for a tasty steak

They serve variety of Spaghetti & Steak, The most expensive is Wagyu Beef, around $160 for 300gram, the beef is great, juicy. The portion for the spaghetti might look small and simple, but the taste is really awesome. The price wise are not extremely expensive but slightly above average. You can try once a while if you are Beef love
