Their ice cream is sinfully delicious! And so is the creme brûlée. No photo of the ice cream as it was consumed immediately!

We got the Whole Chocolate Cake at Plaza Singapura yesterday. It was delicious. It was light and not too sweet. Just perfect.

I should have splurged! The truffle I ate was a local specialty flavour, I can't remember the name, and it tasted amazing! Coconut and some sweet almond paste with dark chocolate...Yum ^^

I visited a outlet in Malcom Street next to telok Ayer food center. You can get some desserts and very good coffee. Usually crowded during lunch hour. Need to wait to get seat. I love hot chocolate. Must try place. Customer service is good and friendly.

Sampled a couple of cakes (the signature cholocate cake and the white chocolate with caramel cake). Both were equally delicious, and good value at about $8 each. It was super busy when we went (Saturday night, about 9pm) so there was no where to sit in the relatively limited seating area.

Returned here after sometime.. My wife love their chocolate cakes, especially the butterscotch sea salt brownies.. This time we ordered that and hazelnut crumble brownie.Their brownies still soft, with strong dark chocolate taste a sweet and salty taste.The crumble also came with a handful of hazelnut crumble on top of the chocolate brownie. Not so sweet and combined with crunchy hazelnut.We also tried their milk chocolate.. Which is very thick with the chocolate..A recommended place to have chocolate in Singapore

We only found this place just before we were leaving for the airport. My husband ordered a 70% hot chocolate, but the lady persuaded him to try the classic instead. They ended up giving us both, which was very generous and we also had a free sample of their most delicious chocolate cake. We would highly recommend a hot chocolate and a slice of cake here. Had we not been leaving Singapore, we would definitely have returned for more

This place will haunt me forever!! We had the ganache cake first and oh my god! It's the best!!!! Also great was the creme brûlée. Then the pouched chocolate. They are the top 3! We have continued to be disappointed with trying out other desserts in this mall and always end up right back at awfully chocolate. We will forever remember you ganache cak

My husband & I were very tempted by these desserts as they look so amazing. Sadly, they look much better than they taste. We tried the dark chocolate truffle, hazelnut crumble & the chocolate tart. Nothing we had was outstanding. The best thing was the truffle, but we've had much better. The hazelnut crumble was okay but would never get it again. The chocolate tart looked amazing but wasn't very good at all, quite flavorless. Plus for the high price I would expect much better. Don't let the delicious looking desserts deceive you & go somewhere else for a treat.
