For truly enjoyable dining and good service call the Alfred the owner in advance and reserve your crab!

A decidedly un-trendy institution in up and coming Tiong Bahru, Golden Spoon is a bona fide foodie nirvana. Perfect for entertaining large groups. Don't you dare eat here without ordering the signature Crab Mi Fen.

Taken there twice in one week by a friend and my aunt for great tasting crab bee hoon, steam fish. Owner Albert very helpful in suggesting dishes. Happily go again!

Good service from the restaurant, think the boss himself served us. Ordered the classic crab bee hoon for two. The crab is nice and fresh. Find the sauce a little salty though, personally would very much prefer if the sauce has a milk base. Overall still good!

Brought some friends from Australia to the Golden spoon and the Crab beehoon and its lovely gravy blew their minds away. My friends wiped the bowl clean literally and without our knowledge went there again by themselves they night before returning home! To the Aussies, the crab was just right and the beehoon was deiciously moist. They slurped their way through the whole dish. We had rojak baby squid which was a little too spicy for their taste and pumpkin cereal tofu-another favourite with their kids. However, Golden spoon was too noisy for any decent conversation as everyone was talking so loudly and the noise level was just not so pleasant. Value for money though

First time to try this hidden gem and a heartland restaurant that located at 62 Seng Poh Lane. They serve with delicious and mouthwatering dishes such as crab mee hoon, soup was tasty. Best was we tasted no MSG in it. We love their toufu with pumpkin sauce, their authentic three cup chicken (San Bei Ji) and they also serve lemongrass with longan as compliments. Staff were friendly and diligent to change the plates for us too

One of the best Chinese zi cha or cooked food place we like to frequent. Service is prompt and place is clean too. They also do takeaways. Just give them a ring to place your order and pick it up later. Best to book a table if you are dining on weekends. We love their food. Everything is so delicious. If you are unsure of what to go for, their boss will gladly recommend you some popular dishes. All time favorites include the pumpkin cereal chicken, fried squid, hei Zhou and their crab beehoon. Location is abit inconvenient if you don't drive. Nearest MRT is Tiong Bahru and it is a distance to walk. If you drive there is a public car park right in front. Do remember to place your parking coupons as the parking attendant do check frequently.

We ordered crab noodles, green vegetables, pork dumplings, baby squid and coffee pork ribs. Everything, which is usually rare in a Chinese restaurant, was outstanding! The crab noodles were super fresh with the right amount of decadent lard content kick, the green emperor vegetables crunchy and the baby squid sweet and tangy. I think this is a good place to bring out of town guests as you are surrounded by locals so it's authentic cuisine and it's set in the increasingly trendy Tiong bahr

Enjoyable dinner with delicious white pepper crabs. Of course not forgetting their signature dish, Mee-hoon crab! Yam paste is really authentic!

is the way to go. It's not cheap, but it's a great meal. The service is friendly and efficient, and the dining area is cheerfully bustling. Located in Block 51 of Havelock as of May, 2014.

Try Crab bee hoon. That tells you enough about the place.魚頭咖哩 is also very nice. Not too sourish but moderately spicy.Others in the menu are also good.Since this stall is adjacent with hawker stalls, you can have cold lime juice, bandun juice, beer, or whatever the drink stall has

Made booking but no table reserved. Waited 30 mins for crab bee hoon. Very disappointed that the taste lacks from original. 6 diners but bee hoon can fill only 1 Chinese bowl. Very disorganized. They ran out of bee hoon and one of our dish after 1 hour into our dinner !

As one of our monthly dine out sessions, a colleague of us brought us to this restaurant and introduces a few dishes which I have never tried before. while we ordered 7 dishes, which are all quite well done, I'll just highlight the 4 dishes that suits my taste best:- the Golden Spoon B-Hoon Crab is the specialty of this restaurant and it's not to be miss! The rice noodle that is soaked in the crab sauce is extremely tasty, and the crab is so fresh that the meat on the leg just fall off from the shell as 1 single piece![Tips] You can asked for the sauce to be refilled, it's free of charge!!!- Though I am not new to Coffee Ribs, this is still one of my favorite, the standard is quite comparable with the other restaurants that I have tried, the well cooked pork ribs soaked in sugary sauce that has a tinge of coffee smell, you can have it either with plain rice or beer...you decide... :)- the Crispy Whitebait fish with seven spices is also a must have, the little fish is well fried to crispy but not burnt, accompanied with the various spices...red chilli, green chilli, pepper, etc...I don't mind having it for finger food- Fried Qing Long Cai, it's a stir fried dish with a kind of vegetable (called Qing Long) that is rarely seen in Singapore, it has the lighter taste of spring onion but a fuller body texture...I am not really sure how to describe but I just remembered the plate of vegetable was emptied within minutes, and there's only 4 of us!Other than the food, the service were very good on the whole, the waitresses keep asking if we are happy with the food and our kettle of hot tea gets refilled constantly before it even have chance to be empty. I'll definitely go there again.Though it is located in a fairly large car park, it's get fill up pretty quickly from 5.30pm onwards, be there earlier if you want to avoid hunting for parking lot around the area

If you go to the original location at Seng Poh Lane in Tiong Bahru you will be sorely disappointed. The chef has opened his own stall at Blk 115 Bukit Merah View, stall 68. Go there instead for the signature crab bee hoon, cereal tofu and some other interesting dishes like marmite ribs (like coffee ribs without the bitterness)

it has moved to 51 havelock road. I called the owner to check as he left a number at one of the foodies page. The one who took over at seng poh lane ( in July 13) continue to use the signage and told everyone who called that they are the same pple. Luckily i called to check before hand!

Tiong baru one is not our golden spoon. It has moved out to east coast already.We asked the staff and she said "same restaurant and same owner, the uncle has just left".Everything is different, staff, service, taste and everything.The bee hoon crab was not it. It was with another noodle and the tast is not... They charged 2 kg for small (apx 1kg) and not tasty crab.All the menu is different.I can not believe they use the same name and insist to say it is the same.For you to avoide disappointment.You need to applogize to your friends like me for the taste.As soon as I try the original tast at east, will post my revew

I have always loved this restaurant since the first time I went last year. The crab beehoon was so rich and flavourful and I was always dragging my friends down to eat it with me. last week I took my parents down to have some good crab beehoon but found that there was something different about it? The taste of the beehoon noodles was so strong and over powered the stock, they had put vegetables in the dish as well which they normally don't, and I found the taste of the veg changed the overall flavour of the dish. It was only half way through the meal that I got a msg from my friend who told me that apparently Golden Spoon has been bought over by the landlord and so even though the name, location and menu is the same... it's not really... "the same". She said she found out at the real Golden Spoon was moving to somewhere near East Coast, which is what they told her when she called to make a reservation a few weeks before!I'm not sure how true this is... but the beehoon is definitely different and no way as enticing as before. Very disappointed

Went there with some friends on Monday night. No trouble getting a table. Chili crab was nice but crab bee hoon was average. Coffee pork ribs was nice and juicy. Service was so so. We ordered kailan but they served another spinach instead. When we asked why Spinach, they replied because no more kailan. Otherwise service was okay
