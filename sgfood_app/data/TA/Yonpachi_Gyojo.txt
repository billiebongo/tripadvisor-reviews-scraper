Ended the year with a lovely dinner at Yonpachi. The ambience was nice and food was exceptional. It was a pity that the service was slow despite not having a full house. There was also no fish of the day which was rather disappointing.

We ordered the Yonpachi Set. Food came fast. Sashimi selection was nice and fresh. Upgraded to the Nabe option and it was a wonderful evening of good food and quiet ambience to catchup with a long time friend. Will come again.

A good wallet friendly Izakaya with good variety of food (more Seafood than meats) as well as drinks.
Will visit again definitely!

If you love seafood then come here. The restaurant gets its seafood directly from Japan. The family meal is very much value for money.

Being tucked away from the noisy area of Robertson Quay, this Jap restaurant at U.E square is ideal for couple / family/ friends night out. Although the menu is not extensive, there are decent number of appetisers, sushi, sashimi and fusion hot-plate grills/rice. Rather affordable, lovely presentation and fresh/ good quality.

In the highly competitive environment in the Robertson Quay area, the place was busy on a Friday night. Relaxing ambience where we could order dishes tapas style to go with drinks.The only brickbat being the place closes pretty early, at 10.30 pm. So either come early and end the night out early or you would have to adjourn someplace else just when you are getting in the mood

My daughter and I had dinner here. She is a big Japanese fan even though she is only 4! We had a nice seafood salad, karage, Yakima onigiri, grilled halibut along with Tempura. All dishes were very good. The service was very good. We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner

We were pleasantly surprised by the good food and quality at this recently opened establishment. Although it was lunch we ordered the beef shabu shabu (Australian beef) which had plenty of flavour but was a little too thickly sliced. The vegetables were very fresh and tasty and we enjoyed the caesar salad with crab as a starter.The staff were attentive and the layout is roomy with plenty of space between tables.We found the prices acceptable

Chose the restaurant from a friend's recommendation. There were 8 of us and we ordered 2 of their promo set ($100 for a 3 person seafood hotpot with sashimi, appetizers and fried chicken size dish), grilled salmon and cod fish from their a al carte menu. The sashimi was fresh and nicely presented. The fried chicken was also nice. The seafood hotpot is a bit of a letdown compared to their branch in Plaza Singapura. The collagen soup base was a tad salty and diluted. Nevertheless, I think their promo set was value for money. However, their a la carte grilled salmon was below average. It was not fresh and the salmon was dry and hard. But what spoilt the entire meal was the service by one of their female staff. She seems like a temporary staff and her service was one of the worst we have ever experienced. We asked for soya sauce and wasabi when she served our sashimi. She took a while and when she brought the wasabi, she just dumped the wasabi at the side of the table and walked off. When my friend asked her if she could refill our tea, she just pointed at the next table and said "tea is there". None of us could reach the tea pot unless we stand up and walked to the next table. So my friend asked if tea is self serve, she ignored the question and after serving our food, she walked over and plonked the teapot at the edge of our table and walked away!! The restaurant was not crowded that night and we were seated in the private dining area. Her poor attitude totally spoilt our dining experience.
