Cheap drinks and excellent food. Real value for money. People are friendly and it's just an awesome place to hang out. It's a must try if you're around the area.
Looking forward to my next time there.

Don't expect too much but it is a palatable retreat if you need one and happened to be in the area. Opened-air so might have to move into the verandahs/corridors or the hotel lobby when weather gets to be too challenging.

it is a sports bar with good ambience. I find it cozy with nice soothing live band. I had the mee goreng and it comes with fried chicken on the sides. It was so yummy delicious. I will go back again just for the mee goreng. We also had Olio Aglio pasta, baked rice, nachos chips with cheese and finished it off with fruity frozen yogurt. All the dishes were tasty and portion was good. We also tried the Mojito, cranberry juice and redbreast whiskey with soda water chaser. I tot the Mojito was wee bit sweet and told the bartender who promptly made another better one for me, no charge! The whisky was smooth and incredible. all in all it is a good place to hangout and chill out

Had a group of 3, tried the pasta olio plus sausage, baked rice, and mee goreng. All the food was excellent. I loved all three, and definitely want to ordr the mee goreng as my pain the next time, if not order the olio again. Like marchi quality. Moderate price too. Had a cider, which was excellent, and a shot of irish whiskey. I love the selection. Will be going back.The female singer was excellent and the wait staff was great service
