Cozy interior, fast service, wood-over pizza and fresh pasta.
They have a good wine collection.
Seating in- and outdoors.
It‚Äôs easy to miss, because there‚Äôs no signage outside.
Do book a table ahead, it‚Äôs a small place.
Buon appetito!

Our second time here, 2.5 years after the first time, and the food and service is just as good. Pity the squid ink pasta was sold out tonight, still an enjoyable experience.

Really hidden amongst the somewhat low-profile shophouses on Kandahar Street and without any large signboard, Cicheti is really good for its various fare such as the BurataCheese Ball, it‚Äôs splendid pizzas and even baked fish covered with salt and many more amazing dishes. Warning though tend to be a bit pricey and portions may be small but delightful nonetheless. Remember to phone in and make reservation before heading for the place to avoid disappointment as usually fully-booked

The waitresses were lovely and attentive and a credit to the owner. By contrast, the "manager' is a disgrace to the owner and should be replaced immediately. On the day I visited I was served a soggy pizza from a wood-fired oven, which I always thought was quite difficult to achieve. The "manager" then tried to explain this away (you may know the type of smartass) as because I was eating a Florentine pizza (with egg in the middle), despite being clearly shown that the whole base was soggy all the way around and the consistency of cardboard. Despite a promise to investigate with the chef he never returned to make any apology or amends. When the bill arrived there was not a single concession for my disappointment expressed, when this would have been when a first class restaurant would have made a gesture. The reverse occurred and clearly the manager was just not in the slightest bit bothered, which is when I got very upset. Again the manager was totally unconcerned. I have eaten pizza around the world, from Bali beachfront to Siena Tuscany and eaten at some of the very best restaurants in Singapore (Tipping Club etc)and quite frankly never had a worse meal and approach taken to what genuinely may have been a bad night for the chef. Owner do something before you lose all your business as I found the ambience in the restaurant generally appealing and would be willing to give it another chance with a change of manager. I should also like to add that I have never written a negative Trip Advisor review before

This is the second time I've visited Cicheti, the menu has changed some since our last visit but the quality of the food and the service remain excellent. On our first visit I had the gnocchi with mushrooms and truffle ricotta, which I see is still on the menu, justifiably as this was without a doubt one of the best gnocchi dishes I've had, both in terms of the texture and preparation of the gnocchi itself, as well as the delicious mushroom sauce and creamy ricotta. My husband and friends enjoyed their meals equally, the lamb ragout my husband had being a particular highlight. This visit I was dining solo after my husband was held up at work, but in spite of having made a reservation for two the staff were very kind and accommodating, and were happy to let me order two main courses and pack up half of each to take home for him. The servers were all friendly and welcoming, and very attentive, my water glass was never empty and they were quick to check on my enjoyment of the food. In addition to the excellent and super friendly service, the food was fantastic, as I expected from our last visit. The two starters I had, the roasted pumpkin with honey and ricotta and the burratina, were the highlight of my meal, such perfect pairings of textures, and sweet/salty flavours, beautifully prepared. The caramelized onions and pesto that came with the burratina were an interesting and delicious twist on this dish. The pollo pizza was also excellent, particularly the pesto sauce and sweet caramelized onions, and the soft, chewy crust was divine. The orecchiete pasta was also good, cooked until just a little al dente and with a tasty fennel sausage. And after my last visit I just had to have the crack pie again, I remember loving it and I wasn't disappointed, it was as good as I remembered and your chefs were kind enough to let me substitute coconut mascarpone for the gelato that normally comes with the dish. This isn't a dessert you find anywhere else in Singapore, and it is super tasty with a crumbly crust and soft interior, and obviously homemade. The atmosphere is great too, the restaurant is small and intimate but does not feel crowded, and the open kitchen makes for interesting viewing, as you can see right into the giant wood fire oven where the pizzas are prepared. Overall a great dining experience

From the time we arrived until we left, the staff and service were hospitable and efficient. Although there may have been a slight translation issue in ordering, everything was delicious from roasted pumpkin to pasta. Too full to try the desserts but would go back again should I have the opportunity

This is a great little Italian. I didn‚Äôt have a reservation but was given a table for an hour..I was a bit hesitant in case it was rushed but not the case at all as service and food was prompt. The pizza was really delicious. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for good Italian food. Good coffee too

My Husband arranged this lovely dinner for my birthday. This place takes two seatings so got to make reservations.The service staff were friendly and attentive. We were seated at a cosy table on the second floor. We started with two appetisers - the octopus and neck clams. Both were the specials for the day and not on menu. The octopus was delicious and done beautifully. The Neck Clams were fresh and the broth that came tasted so good we were going to clean out the plate. We had red wine. We had two pastas for mains - Pici, braised lamb sugo, porcine, soffrito, parmigiana for the hubby and I had Orecchiette, fennel sausage, preserved lemon. The Pici pasta was Home made and really nice. The lamb is good too and no gamey taste. I am not a fan of lamb but it was good. You can hardly find Orecchiette pasta in most singaporean restaurants and I was really craving for orecchiette. The best I had was in NY at Rosemary‚Äôs. I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all. The only two feedback we had 1) that the mains were served before we had finished our appetisers which is sort-of a ‚Äúno-no‚Äù in a restuarant service playbook. But good thing we were at the tail end so it was okay. 2) Service staff mixed up our sparkling and still water when he filled our glasses. For dessert we had the was ‚Äúbirthday cake‚Äù my husband arranged. It was a lava chocolate cake with a scoop of ice cream. It was nice of the staff to sing along a birthday song with me. Thank You!An espresso and a cappuccino to close the meal! All in a Very good day. Will come again

Booked a table for 2 for 830pm on a Saturday night. Reservation process was smooth. Was running late so called the restaurant twice at 824pm but to no response. Got there just before 900pm and the host told us that it was too bad they gave our table away 5 minutes earlier and said there was no more vacancies. He was pretty curt about it and offered no alternative (e.g. allowing us to wait, return later). Why bother having a phone if they do not pick up calls.

Came here today for lunch with a friend. We each opted for a pizza and then shared them. Both of them were really quite decent. Not particularly cheap at around $30 each but then that seems to be the going rate for a good pizza in Singapore. Nice renovated shophouse and friendly service.
3
The pizza we had with prosciutto & cheese was bland , definitely needs the tomato base for added flavour..
The base was gluggy in the middle & very salty..
Definitley needed cooking for longer..
The food prices are expensive.
5
As Italian I can say the pizza they have here is definitely one of the best you can have in Singapore.
Already been to many other Italian pizzeria which don't make the pizza like Cicheti..
Would definitely recommend to anyone and will come back again!!!
5
Our favourite Italian restaurant in Singapore! Great pizza and desserts are awesome.
Make a booking in advance, especially on weekends.
5
Hidden gem at Haji Lane area üòçüòç My most favorite is its cacciucco! It us to die for! My Italian friend stated that its pizza is the authentic one. Make sure you make reservation as it is always full and check the operational time.
4
The pizza is good! It is like those I tried in Naples with chewy base. Very delicious and big and generous. We also tried the seafood stew which is rich and flavourful. The antipasti was a bufala salad but not as generous in portion as it was only a small bowl. Service was alright
4
Located at Kandahar street near the Mosque in Bugis area. The resto is rather small, so better make reservation before coming here! We did like a day in advance but need to call again to ensure we have reservation, and our "feeling" was right, no reservation made, so we redo it again, lucky it was because of my accent! Lol!The margharita pizza was amazing!

If you're a neopolitan pizza fan, this is the place for you! With an authentic wood fired oven that puts out a pizza in 90 seconds, you can't go wrong at Cicheti. We always order the Diavola (the salami is sliced in matchsticks) but there are many other red and white options. The pasta is equally well prepared though I haven't tried many mains (smaller selection). If you like octopus, be sure to order the polpette. This used to be offered as a special but proved so popular that it is now on the menu. The harissa in the sauce packs a nice punch and the octopus is tender and one of the best I've had. Menu is reasonably priced as are the wines

Read about this restaurant online when I went to SG for business trip. I was wandering in the area so I and my colleague went there for dinner because it was recommended on a food blog. Arrived there on a weekday so it was not that busy. As soon as we arrived, the waiter told us that the ONLY seat he could offer us is outside (as you know, SG is very hot and could be torturing without aircon unless you want to smoke) because we didnt make reservation. No problem, I thought. It was their policy so we took the offer and made order.Not long after that (maybe 10-15 mins after), a Caucasian couple arrived. I overheard that they didn't have reservation either, and the waiter offered them to sit INSIDE at the bar. I was like 'WHAT', but didn't say anything since I and my colleague were already settled in our seat. I don't want to accuse of the waiter or restaurant of anything ill. But if there's anything i would advise to the staffs: ASK your patron where they prefer to sit and recommend them what you think with sincerity. Maybe Asians don't usually sit at the bar because the chairs tend to be higher, you can tell them that politely. But you know there's AC inside so give them that option also. In the end, only you can know what's the motive of the recommendation. But you can also make the experience more enjoyable and acceptable for the customer

Casual dinner. Decent menu. Seating on two levels. Friendly staff. Comfortable seating. But that is all there is to the place in my opinion. The pizza was just OK. The tomato marinara sauce was too watery which made the pizza base soggy. Tasted good though with the basil coming in nicely. The gnocchi was good in itself but the mushroom sauce was too strong. Also, I was wondering what lumps of ricotta cheese was doing in the sauce. The panna cotta again by itself was good but adding some ice shavings with syrup to it as dressing was a bad idea. It left a watery bottom which took away the creaminess of the panna cotta. All items were served on unimaginative dishes with no serving spoons. Go figure. Not coming back in a hurr

Cicheti is a tiny & cute Italian restaurant, and the perfect spot for a great lunch in the city.The menu features a great bunch of Italian dishes and they are all wonderful...The gnocchi are simply dreamy !!!The service is prompt & friendly ; the prices are average ; the quality is on top 
5
place looks rather interesting, food was good, service was decent but could be better. a nice place to have dinners in small groups

Had a lovely family meal here. Food is good quality and tasty with portions at just the right size. The deserts were amazing especially the chocolate fondant!
The staff were all very friendly which added to the evenings good atmosphere.

Nice restaurant nested in kandahar st, ambience is cosy and not pretentious.
Starters were very good, pizza as well, italian style, some of the best in singapore.
Could improve the cocktail/wine list but overall very good experience.
3
we sat upstairs and the seating was very uncomfortable, I don't think I have ever commented on this issue at a restaurant, so this would be the first time, so it left an impression. The food was good but not great I was told the pizza was awesome, it was good but not that remarkable. there was atmosphere downstairs. I really wanted to like the restaurant as we enjoy the arab street area. Worth a try but just manage the expectations. Service again was ok, a comment was confused and we landed up getting a double serving of a dish

As an Italian I really have a problem with restaurants that represent themselves as being "authentic" Italian while dramatically failing to deliver. Cicheti is yet another of those cases.I can forgive the name misspelled (it's "cicchetti"). But can't accept basic Italian dishes mislabeled and, more importantly, poorly prepared. Case in point the pizza "napoletana" one of the most basic concepts in Italian tradition. When the pizza arrived without any mozzarella, we represented the issue to the waiter thinking it was an oversight. Adding insult to injury, she proceeded to explain to me that was the real "napoletana" and mozzarella was not part of the recipe. Explaining to her that as Italian i had hundreds of "napoletana" and even googling pictures and recipes did not suffice. Sadly there is a similar pizza without mozzarella but is called "marinara". The list can go on (pizza with pesto, seriously?) but feel i have already wasted too much time. Bottom line if you feel like authentic Italian, you are better of bringing your buddies elsewhere. Sad

Went to Cicheti to celebrate our friend's birthday...first impression not good as awkwardly waited to be greeted for 5 minutes or more upon entering. Nice ambience and decor and food was good, but my main course was not delivered until after everyone else at the table had finished theirs. The waiter was not apologetic and just blamed the busy kitchen. When we repeatedly asked to speak with the Manager she never appeared so had to pull her aside on the way out....my friend said she rolled her eyes at me as I walked away. Too bad this place does not realize how important customer service is....a simple "sorry" or some attention would have prevented me from posting this rant

Came here for dinner as the reviews were so good was disappointed firstly we were sat upstairs there was no music and only another table with people no atmosphere at all when there were empty tables downstairs when we walked in and when we left it wasn't a busy night. The food is over priced the wagu $40 comes with a salad it was chewy And the most uncomfortable chairs!!
5
The food was amazing. Everything was just so good. Service was impeccable and attentive. Here's a shortlist of items I tried and absolutely LOVED:- Grilled octopus (SO GOOD)- Burrata (YUMMY)- Wagyu Steak, medium rare (Really good)- Sea Salt Bass (Takes 45min, so order asap! Ask them to debone if possible)- Crack Pie (YASSSS, name sounds about right because i'm addicted)- Tiramisu (One of the best I've ever had and I'm not even a tiramisu person)Other items were not bad but hey, everyone has their own preferences right.- Calamari- Soft Shell Crab- Diablo, Prosciutto & Rocket, Margarita Pizza (Made Fresh and Good but i'm not big pizza person)- Pasta was so s

Lovely handmade Italian food. The pizzas are all-time favourites and they are made fresh, just like their pasta. The thin crust pizza may be large and can be shared amongst two while the pasta portions are manageable for one. The desserts are really good so make sure you do not over fill with main course that you do not have the space for it. Their 72% lava cake is a must try. It tends to get crowded during lunch and dinner so making a reservation is highly recommended. We went for lunch on a weekday and it was packed at lunch. Tends to get a bit noisy as it is a cosy small and quaint place. I was told that the bar was on the second level of this shop house. It is not so easily visible when you walk along the corridor and I missed it the first time round.

It was a dinner to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. Let me start sharing my wonderful experience, by saying this, the service staff coupled with the delicious food!! 10/10!! Ok, here goes! TBH, it took me a min, searching for the restaurant. But it's all good. The moment we were seated, the waiter, properly introduced himself, and the menu. Which was a good start and it only got better. We had initially ordered, 2 starters and 2 mains and a dessert, all to share. After the first dish came, and got gobbled down!! cause it was so tasty, within minutes the second dish came! We knew by then we had to order another starter, only because! To our surprise and delight! Our third starter came within mins! And before our mains! We were so glad to have the experience of a fine dining restaurant! The waiters took notice of everything, barely had to ask for a top up of water in our glasses even! For starters, we ordered: 1) calamari. 2) grilled octopus, lastly 3) grilled butter prawnsFor mains we ordered: 1) carbonara pizza, 2) mushroom gnocchi Mind you I hardly ever eat mushrooms! Buuuuuuut!! This gnocchi dish, changed me for that moment!! And yes I had the entire pizza to myself! Well ok, no, I gave me GF a slice! Only because it was her birthday and I don't like runny egg yolks! Guys! Y'all definitely need to get the carbonara pizza! And that prawns and the calamari!! Thank me later. Ps: their menu changes from time to time, pls check for their daily specials, if the grilled octopus is available, don't wait! :D frankly I'm getting hungry thinking about the food there! I'll definitely be back to try the other pizza on the menu and have more of that damn good calamari!! Thanks for taking the time to read my review!Peace!Nicky! (

Could not fault the place. Good quality, excellent starters and epic pizza (and I know good pizza!).
Worth wondering around the local area which isn't well known to most.
This has a great upmarket feel without the insane price tags and is very worthwhile visiting.
4
We love this place, it is lively, good and reasonably priced.
Pizza are among the top in Singapore, great pasta and discreet but well done wine list.
Not as place for a romantic date but for friend gathering.
4
The food here is reliably good. The flat bread is very tasty as is the accompanying pesto. Have the pappardelle ragu. The sauce is rich and the pasta is freshly homemade.
4
It is good to know that reservation is needed and it open at 6.30 pm. Pizza is small (10'') bu really delicious. Ambient is nice and warm.
4
Highly recommend the grilled octopus, which is better than those I had in Barcelona.
Also, the pizza carbonara is very nice.
Cozy dining environment upstairs.
4
more than the food, the general decor and atmosphere makes this restaurant worth staying. i really like to wooded table and brick walls with paintings. quiet also, no loud discussion as in many restaurant.service is attentive and excellent for a restaurant this category in Singaporewe ordered one pizza and two antipasti for two. Carpaccio was not outstanding. meatball were in an excellent tomato sauce and slices of grilled bread coming along were particularly nice. pizza has very good basis but the tomato sauce feels too thin\watery and gave a bit of a wet texture to the pizza dough. it was still good, but with the same sauce as the meatball, it would have been truly excellent.wine list is OK. a bit expensive, but not more than many places anyway.a good evening all in all

We went for dinner to Cicheti as a party of 4 adults. The table was reserved on Monday evening at 6.30pm for dinner at 7.30pm on the same night. On arriving at the restaurant, my mum and I reached first and were shown to a high table meant for 6 people. We requested for a table with low seating since my mum has pain in her knees, so is unable to climb/ step up and sit comfortably. This was the start of the rudeness by the manager. He flatly refused to even make any attempt to accommodate us on any other table, saying that the place was fully booked (we were seated at the 3rd occupied table on the lower floor where there were 3 more tables empty at the time). So we adjusted and ordered our meal since we wanted to have a peaceful dinner. Midway through the meal my mum switched to the extra (till them empty) seat since I had ordered prawns and the smell was too strong and bothered her (she is vegetarian, and not a fan of seafood smell). Back came the manager to tell her off !!! We told him that she would switch back to her seat if any other guests showed up. That wasn't good enough for him, so instead of creating a hue and cry my mum simply sat back on the original seat.This is when I requested the manager to have a chat with me and then started his racist rant against Indians :(Some quotes from our conversation - things actually said by the Cicheti Manager to me: "There is always problems with Indians only, they agree on the phone and then want something different when they come""I hate Indians""There are many other Italian restaurants, why don't you go there"We finished the food we had ordered till then, paid our bill, refused to pay the 10% service charge and left!We have lived in Singapore for nearly a decade now and also travelled extensively abroad. We have never faced such racist behaviour from people on the front line in the service industry. So appalled and disturbed by this experience that I felt compelled to share it in such great detail

My friend took me here for dinner which is located near Arab Street. It is a nice Italian restaurant which is quite lively when busy. We made a reservation in advance lucky as it got very busy later.For starters we ordered the pumpkin and prawns. For mains stuck with pizza and prawns pasta then finished off with pana cotta which wasn't that good.Overall, a good restaurant and worth trying out
5
Joined a bday dinner of a friend. The variety of food was amazing. We started with a flat bread and a dip which was super delicious. Meatballs where ok, but not too much for me. Greatest dish the grilled octopus - juicy & tender! Pizzas where yumm too. I loved the truffled gnocchi. Unfortunately I had to leave as the little one was tired, but the rest of the crowd was happy with the next dishes - fish, steak and a tiramisu bday cake! The staff was very attentive and I liked the simple & cosy atmosphere of the place.Will be back for sure

Cicheti used to be an old favorite of mine. Cozy- good ambience. good food. But not with their recent expansion and unfriendly staff, I will not be returning. I booked 2 days in advance for dinner for 2. I requested 8 pm but the woman on the phone insisted 8:15. Fine. Me and my husband arrived at 8:16 and as we are walking in - i receive a call from the restaurant. She saw us outside and just hung up the phone. Someone else led us to our table. Let me give you an idea what the restaurant was like at this point: 2 tables inside on first floor had people. 2 groups of tables outside had people. The rest of the first floor was TOTALLY EMPTY. They led me ( 8 months pregnant) up the narrow stairs to the second floor. I had never been to the second floor before. Once we got up there- the vibe was gone. it was a room crammed full of empty tables with a quiet singaporean couple in the corner. our table was right in front of the stairs with my back to a fire hose. We asked if we could be seated in the first floor as 80% of the tables were empty. They went to check and said No. We decided not to waste our date night sitting in an ambience-less room with staff who were not willing to accommodate a seating request in a very empty restaurant. We decided to leave and the manager had his back turned on his as we left. Overall a very bad experience. It is a shame that a restaurant has lost it's soul after expanding. Scaling up is important but retaining your core values are as well. Very Disappointed
4
Not a really big restaurant with a very unique design.
The food was nice, especially the Pizza & Pasta.
Do take note to make a reservation if you wish to visit on Friday or Saturday.
5
We were a table of 11, ate as much as we could possibly handle, drank Presseco all night and came away for about 60 SGD each!!!
The pizzas were delicious and very traditional and the gnocchi was something really special.
3
Went for dinner here based on the good reviews online. Service was ok, food was average and the wine was overpriced for what it was. There‚Äôs better Italian food to be had in Singapore, with better wines too.
4
The restaurant is small but cozy.
Food is good, specially pizza is so nice and maybe the best one that i have eaten in Singapore.
Personnel is kind and price is acceptable.
4
We went there for dinner , we had a great time.
Good food, good ambience and food service. The price is reasonably good
4
The pizzas are very good. The seats are hard on the backside. It would be nice if we could have stayed longer to drink and chat. I guess it's a young peoples place. The price is inexpensive and affordable. The service folks are friendly,helpful and nice. Good bunch 
5
We had a great meal here. Last time we were in Singapore we spotted this little gem but it was full so this time we reserved. Would definitely recommend reserving as it is small. The pizzas looked amazing, my husband had one it excellent. I had their pasta with prawns and a seafood appetizer and both were really tasty. Wine in Singapore is expensive, we took from the lower end of their wine list but it was very nice, in fact all their wine list was small but nicely varied.Will definitely go bac

Despite all the good reviews I found Cicheti quite average. We had roasted pumpkin which was ok but nothing special. For mains we had pasta which was again average. The pasta itself was fine but the sauce was lacking depth. The wines were totally overpriced for average bottles. Underwhelmed experience for the price paid
4
Cicheti sits amid the shop houses of Kandahar Street, a shoe box sized Italian restaurant that more than delivers on its promises, although the number of covers is very limited. I have eaten here twice in this same week and both times my hosts raved about the place, especially the flour which is imported direct from Italy and is the same as used in the finest dining establishments there, apparently.The food is simple and delicious. The quinoa and pumpkin salad was very good. We shared a pizza and a buratta as well one time, and the second time we both had the chicken in pizza bread as a main. The coffee is good too and the service was punctual and polit
4
Place is difficult to find as one would get lost in the street with the similar looking buildings. The inside of the restaurant is small. No wonder someone without reservation will find difficult to get a table. However, the food especially the pizza is excellent quality and no less in anyway when it comes to taste. We ordered Romana and Margarita di bufala. The wines are expensive. The best part of the dinner was the delicious dessert. Salted Dark chocolate baked with vanilla gelato makes a happy ending to the dinner.
4
The oven pizza rivals any other place in the world. We also had grilled octopus which was excellent. We were upstairs and the place is nice with brick walls and large print.
They have a recipe for success!
4
A very busy restaurant in Little India, with a traditional Italian menu. We were seated outside on a roof terrace which was fine (as we had not booked in advance) Food was very good although wine was expensive for what was offered. Would recommend as service was really good with owner working the tables
5
Located at 52 Kandahar Street just next to kampong Glam. Parking is available the roadside. Limited though. This is a cozy restaurant with limited seating capacity. Thus, reservation is a must. Three of us shared the Buratina and pumpkin for starter, prawn pasta and a pizza for mains. They were all very nicely done. We spent an average of $35 per pax. The service is also very prompt. You can also see how the pizza is done if you are seated at level 1. A must try restaurant in Singapore.
4
We ate here on a Wednesday evening, great atmosphere for a midweek night, it was so busy they were turning people away. All our food was great, the 4 starters were delicious and the pear salad worth a mention on its own. Finished up with the salted chocolate which is yummy. Would recommend booking
5
Had a dinner at this restaurant. I was very happy with the food and service. Tried grilled octopus, pollo pizza and salad. Everything was perfect. The pizza was stone baked on a thin crispy bread which I really liked and grilled octopus is a must try! Cozy place with a friendly atmosphere. Would be better to make a reservation if you are going on a weekend
5
One of our favourite meals in Singapore. My husband had the meatballs to start which were absolutely amazing and I had the pear salad which was delicious although could have had a touch more Gorgonzola. We both chose pizza for our main course, they were thin and crispy and really yummy. We have a pizza oven at home so we're super critical and these were fabulous. The service was friendly and relaxed and although the restaurant is small the interior is really well designed and is really welcoming.We'd definitely recommend this restaurant to others and come back too
5
While working in Singapore, I was longing for a great traditional italian pizza. Coming from Melbourne I often eat at the world's no1 pizza house as voted in 2015 in Napoli. Well, looks like i found there rival here in Singapore. Pizza's where equally as good as what i get at Gradi 400. Service and hospitality was excellent and attentive. So impressed i will be going there again this week to try out there pasta. This is a great place to eat out with rustic decor and relaxing ambiance.
5
Lovely restaurant in the "Arab Street" area of Singapore. The food is excellent, have been here many times and even friends who lived in Italy for long periods commented how good the food is.Pizzas are very good - they have a purpose built clay oven in the restaurant. Meat Ragu and salted caramel deserts are both standout dishes.Wine starts at around SGD 50 a bottle which is really rare for Singapore and a special mention to the Head Waiter / Manager who is extremely good, attentive and welcoming
4
You could wander by this place without even noticing is was a restaurant, let alone a really good Italian restaurant. But it's worth taking an extra minute or two to track this place down. The food is excellent. Quality of the ingredients is also excellent, and it's very authentically Italian in taste and how the food is made. Had a very nice pizza and a lovely fresh salad. A a smoked cheese cake for pudding which was both odd and delicious in equal measure.Service was good, price was reasonable. They do seem to shut quite early for lunch though, so get there early

First, say thanks for the unforgettable and outstanding good service given by the two ladies which no chance to say thank you and ask their names. ( too busy) To the small pilipina who intro couple of specials and took orders so clear with smile. And to the skinny tall Malaysian lady at the door who gave a table even we're walk ins which I know busy that day. Even after a day we came back she remember and really find a way to give us a sit. Checking every table for food and drinks. Two ladies with a big smiles, laughing to each other helping each other. So remarkable. This is what you called good service.Food is superb. Specials wonderful. Margarita done so good ( 1st day we came) is really good and can't compare with other resto. Same pizza (after a day) is all same. Only the squid ink a bit different taste on the second day. (Dunno why!) G. Fungi tasty and mouth watering. Salted chocolate and profetirol really can't resist. Really good. Impressive. Kudos to all chefs. Specially to pastry chef which my kids love it so much. Can't find this kind of resto with a good combi of food and service in sg. This is the only one Cicheti. Till next visit. Will come back for sure next family trip. Kudos everyone
5
Great spot for a casual mid week meal. We ate delicious pizza from the wood fired oven and amazing fresh pasta. Good service and value for money. A little gem.
5
Another good place for good food in town.
If you are looking for a decent meet without the potatoes around, this is a good find...
They also do pretty niece pizza and other Italian food aside with some good wine.
3
Pizza is good, only the size should be upgraded to be closer to the Italian one. Average rating so far..... Maybe more for people without kids, location is good for night out.

Cicheti was great for the two of us looking for a chilled out time on the eve of New Year's eve. The setting of the restaurant made for a cosy and intimate feel, and the food did the rest of the job of making us feel very happy (the service was good too). We decided to share the Pizza Carbonara (a little runny but otherwise good, though it arrived within 3 minutes of ordering which is puzzling! good thing we were hungry), Cappellini Zafferano (very, very tasty, so I wished the portion was slightly bigger - greedy me) and Manzo Alla Griglia (my favourite of the 3). One note on the wine. We ordered a Barolo (2009)...when it was brought to us, the vintage presented was 2010 (for once, I was looking out). I sent it back as the staff did not highlight it upfront. We ordered another wine as they had no more stock, no big deal, but I thought the staff should let us know if the vintage presented was going to be different from the one we ordered.If you are looking for a more "romantic" time, be sure to ask (when you make the reservation) if there's a big group of diners on the ground floor table just in front of the kitchen. When we were there, a big group was clearly having a great time with screams and hoots coming from them, which was a bit distracting for me and my partner. We could have moved to the first floor but chose to stay put. Still we had a great time

Amazing!! my friend and i had a trip to Spore for Christmas Holiday and we found a great Italian restaurant near to Arab Street. Wonderful Italian cuisine and wine at a very affordable price. We were blown away by the antipasti and wonderful service. Me and my friends would highly recommend this place if you are looking for great Italian food and friendly service with a smil

Great place ruined by the service level. In fact, it was the GM, Ravi who ruined it for us. It was a great night until he tried to "chase" us away by accusing us of drinking too slow; 2mins before his staff told us it's ok, we can take our time and asked nicely that we try to finish it in the next 30mins because they are closing (1st notification). Ravi told us shortly that we only have 5mins to leave (when we both had a full glass of wine) in the most abrasive attitude that I have ever encountered and invited us to leave a comment because he is the GM and co-owner of the restaurant. The food was not too bad to be fair but not good enough to want to come back to this arrogance. There are too many great options in Singapore to bother

Four of us went to Cicheti for dinner and had an array of dishes to share. We started with asparagus, beef carpaccio and grilled octopus. All three were fabulous with the grilled octopus taking the honors. For mains we had the meatballs (signature dish and delicious), margarita pizza and prawn & scallop pasta. The only slight negative was the sauce for the pasta seemed "wrong" and like. Lobster bisque. Overall a fantastic meal with two bottles of Itallian White wine
5
I love Cicheti - it's in such a great spot and luckily not too far from home.The grilled octopus and asparagus last night were cooked to perfection. Pizzas and pastas are always great but the mushroom gnocchi is just perfect every time. Service is always fast and with a smile by the great team. Keep up the good work guys
5
Cicheti is one of my favourite Italian restaurants in Singapore. The food, wine, service and prices are all great! I love going with a big group so we can order a few pizza and pasta dishes to share. Always satisfied after a meal at Cicheti :

Yes, the pizza is some of the best we've had in Asia - authentic. The rest of the meal- from grilled octopus to olive oil cake was also excellent and on par with some of the best casual Italian we've had in Asia. Reservations a must on weekday nights. Ask for specials not on the menu - we had a delightful olive oil cake that the kitchen was "testing". Wines are also very good value. Finally, the location of the restaurant was delightful - great area to explore for non-residents
5
Was Great foods, tasteful with original italian products,Service was Great just water Could be in bottle at least in this special restaurant üòâüëç
5
I'm Italian, and I loved this place a lot. Every time you want a taste of Italy in Singapore this is the best stop. Pizza is great (wood oven) and wine is great too. Price is ok, not too cheap tho.
Stop by
5
We been there a few times and always the food is delicious and the service is amazing. The wood fired pizza made in real neapolitan oven is just amazing, one of the best I had (I'm Italian so I know really good pizza).
5
Great casual Italian. Service was highly attentive, but to the point where it felt rushed--like they were trying to turn the table. We went somewhere else for dessert so we could relax. feeling like Food choices varied from good to outstanding. Grilled pumpkin salad was fantastic and a good value. Carpaccio was excellent, Lamb Pappardelle was good but not up to the hype. The Montepulciano wine-by-the-glass paired well with the food.. Would go back, but maybe not on a busy night
5
I'd been to Cicheti a couple of times for lunch and really enjoyed their pizza and pasta dishes. They also have an amazing space upstairs with a dedicated bar and adjoining balcony which I thought would be perfect for a birthday celebration. With the help of the kind and friendly staff at Cicheti, I arranged for their delicious set menu for 30 of my friends taking over the whole of that top floor last Friday. The food was excellent, service punctual and friendly, plus the deal even included some good beer and wine. I would highly recommend this restaurant for Italian food lovers going out for lunch, dinner, or holding a big celebration
5
We visited Cicheti with another family friends> They serve very good value wine and the pizza and pasta are also very well served with good price. The staffs are very friendly and help you to choose the right menu for you. The atmosphere is very casual but not noisy and it is located in a very convenient area. Car parking can require some help if you do not use the parking of hospitals

We went to Cicheti as a bit of an impromptu plan, and just managed to get seats up on the tiny terrace. Splendid food, I‚Äôm definitely going back. Having spend two weeks in Italy earlier this year does not make me a connoisseur of pizza, but what we had was up there. Really, really tasty with goo dingredients and a great crust. Succumbed and had dessert too, and the tiramisu was excellent, and the molten dark chocolate and pink sea salt baked for 15minutes was gooey goodness. We moved inside for the dessert, and I really enjoyed the ambience, the d√©cor and the pleasant service. While its certainly not cheap, I paid less for a shared starter, a drink, pizza and dessert each, than I would expect to in most places of this kind in Singapore.
4
Cicheti is an Italian restaurant in the heart of Kampong Glam, located at 52 Kandahar Street, Singapore. I have been there for lunch even if it is recommended for dinner. I have found nice customer service staff, good Italian food and comfortable design. The name derives from latin word "ciccus", that means "cicheti", signature small bites served at lunch in Venice's "b√†cari", or wine bars. There is also a good range of wines, some available by glass. I had a good Pizza Napoletana, crispy Calamari Fritti, cold Italian Beer and robusto Expresso Coffee
4
Yes, reservation is needed but we were lucky to get bar seats on our second visit as walk-ins. We were determined to try out the same two dishes we had before just to check on its consistencies. They were the Cioppino and Bismark Pizza. My dining partner loved the pizza the first time but I wasn't too impressed then. But I must say, it was good this time and we love the Cioppino because the seafood was really fresh and the stock rich. This is my recommendation for first-timers. There are certainly more good dishes to try, one of which is the Burrantina and my favourite Squid Ink pasta. But then, there is always another visit. I know we wouldn't resist having the soup again. Next time, we would starve ourselves for more

This place has many good reviews, and getting a dinner reservation is quite hard because it is so popular. Having tried it out, I am not sure why that is so.The restaurant itself is nicely appointed and pleasing on the eye. It is relaxed, pleasant and informal.We ordered a number of plates, which came out one by one over quite a long period. The last one was very long in coming indeed (even though they were all ordered at the same time). We had long since eaten the earlier arrivals. And it only came after we reminded them that there was still one dish outstanding. We tried to order beef carpaccio, but that was "finished". Quite surprising that this Italian staple was sold out, because it was still very early in the evening.Cicheti Burratina - the burratina was fresh and creamy, the parma ham was mediocre, but the rocket salad was tasteless and very stringy (tough leaves and stalks). Overall quite a nice dish.Rucola and Pear Salad - interesting that in the dish above they used "arugula" on the menu, whilst in this dish they used "rucola", but they were the same (tough and stringy) rocket leaves in both dishes. Insufficient gorgonzola to make any taste impact. Disappointing.Gamberoni - nothing special, though nothing to complain. Quite large prawns, couldnt taste the smoked herbs.Polpetta - nice taste, very nice sauce, though the meat was rather tough.House pinot grigio - rather thin and acidic, small serve.Value for money is quite good, the chicheti (the Venetian equivalent of tapas plates) are around $11 each which is good value.Overall, I was not sure whether to give this a 3 or a 4. I would rather have given it 3.5, as I felt the food quality was not quite good enough for a "4", but it deserved a bit better than a "3"
4
This is one of the best Italian meals I've had ever (and I used to live in Italy and New York!). Wouldn't expect fantastic Italian cuisine from this neighborhood of Singapore, but it's stellar. Pizzas and pastas are delicious. Call ahead for reservations.
5
Please try the Cioppino and Salted Choc Lava Cake. They are the best I could find so far.
Food quality is a 5. And restaurant manager and waitresses are happy friendly always.
1
Had dinner in April with some friends and it was enjoyable. OK service but I must agree with one of the other reviews I've read that something has changed. Worse of all, when trying to make a reservation I called about twenty times over 3 days and nobody picked up the phone. Mailbox full as well. Obviously not interested in customers. Really disappointing.
5
I am a frequent visitor to Cicheti from the inception and I must say I never had a bad meal. Being who I am, I generally eat the same food, so I think I am qualified to say that the food is very consistent served by friendly servers. They run a tight shop, 4 service staff including the General Manager and the Restaurant Manager and they work as a solid team to make sure all the guests are well looked after and most importantly the food is served at the right temerature.I have eaten in almost all Napolitan Pizzerias here in Singapore, including the newest addition on the river, nobody has even come closer to the quality and tsate Cicheti is able to bring!I am sure if you know Napolital Crust Pizza, you will not be dissapointed!
5
I and my friend work in hotel. Two days ago, I and my friend when here for dinner. And I will say that food here are excellent. We had Carbonara pizza, Calamari, pappardelle ragu and two glass of red.Overall food here are freshly make and tasty environment are good. Staff here are proactive although they are super busy. One thing that I am impressed is the manager there, they will go table by table to ask for feedback. I will say I will recommended my friends to this place.Food price here are average. You all should try it
5
We had pass by the restaurant for a few time and it is always full house. Finally we manage try it few days ago. We had try Cicheti signatures:- Cicheti Burratina. we also order Carbonate pizza and Diavola Pizza That's our favour. Overall :- Food here are great and freshly make, so enjoy your wine, relax,when you are waiting for your food. and Service here are good and proactive
2
Went to this place a couple of times before, used to really like, even to promote it, it but some thing must have changed recently - either in the kitchen or in the management. We had a very bad experience recently as a group: menu was imposed for the whole group but the price of the menu was actually much more than buying individual dish "a la carte". In the end, clearly not enough food for the group.Foodwise, it was ok but not so great. Pizza were good but that s it. Desert was really average.Don t do group booking: you will waste your money and I believe their policy is clearly unfair.Quite disappointed by that place that we used to love. Management must keep in mind that a restaurant mustn't sleep on its early successes if it wants to last..
4
A group of us 6 ladies dined at Cicheti SG for the 1st time after much rave from our friends. We had the signature dishes and they were so good. The place is laid back and cosy great for catch ups, romantic dinner or business meetings. As customer service is no.1 priority for me, I took the effort to write this review because good service should be recognized. Job well done Cicheti, keep it up
3
The restaurant is indeed very nicely decorated and a nice place for the eyes.But the quality of the food is in best case average (we tried pasta and pizza). The taste of the pizza was weird - far from italian taste. The pasta was overcooked and the bolognese looked like a burger that was cut into too big pieces (pasta bolognese was not on the menu but they said they could do it - but they could not...).For the very high price this quality is not acceptable
5
Found ourselves in the neighborhood and pulled up some reviews. Cicheti's showed up, and seemed like it would be a good fit. There were some reviews that weren't very favorable of the service, but we thought we'd give it a shot. Seated upstairs without a reservation (now we know!) - and were met by our server - she was great. Ordered three different pizzas and a bottle of wine - and absolutely loved our dinner. The pizzas were fantastic - excellent crust, toppings were just right - by far, the best pizza we've had in Singapore! I also want to emphasize that the service we received was superb. I'd go so far as to say it was probably one of the best dining experiences we've had in SG in our two years. Thank you Cicheti
4
Nice place, well decorated, with good vibe. Good service, good pizza and reasonable prices. Only downside is that it's a bit noisy upstairs. Will go there again.
4
The only place in South East Asia where the pizzas reminds me the ones in Naples !
Do not hesitate !
5
Went there for my friends birthday. And we had a great time! We had the quarto fromagg pizza, which was superb. Their pumpkin salad was also very nice. We ended off with a salted lava cake, which was beyond words. The service was great and very friendly.
5
This is a gem of a cafe in Kampong Glam. The ironic juxtaposition of a funky Italian cafe, with a great fit out in the Malay quarter makes the experience so much more enjoyable.I dropped in for a quick lunch on my last day in Singapore. The service is efficient and friendly. Drinks were delivered promptly and my meal order taken quickly.The Cicheti Burratina was delicious. Sweet juicy melon, salty prosciutto and peppery rocket all combined with the most delicious burratina. A flavour sensation.The duck ragu with rigatoni was beyond delicious. Gentle flavours all combining to produce a great tasting dish.Not cheap lunch with drinks, but a very satisfied diner whose value for money expectations were met.Sensational
4
Went there to celebrate a birthday with friends. Gotta say, food was really really good and exceeded expectations. The Uni pasta was extremely memorable! Highly recommended. Ambience wise, ok. Not a fancy restaurant but comforting. Would have given them an excellent rating but service was so so otherwise would definitely be back for the great quality food. Go for good food but don't expect the service to match.
4
Fantastic little Italian restaurant with great food and atmosphere. None of the courses we ordered were anything other than delicious, but the simpler classic dishes (the ragout in particular) were definitely the best. It is also not expensive for an Italian in a popular area of Singapore, and even has reasonable value wine which is almost unheard of!Only two criticisms which stop it getting 5/5. First, the service was good and the staff knowledgable, but the food arrived piecemeal (main courses around 10 mins apart) and was very slow with over an hour between starters and main courses. Second, we were told we couldn't have cocktails despite the cocktail shaker and eclectic selection of spirits on the bar. This wasn't a big issue but did seem a bit unusual...Overall we had a really good time and will definitely be going back, would recommend if you're not in a hurr
3
I found the food average in taste. For starters, we ordered the calamari($11) and Insalata di Rucola (salad with pear, $11) to share. Calamari was crispy but otherwise lacking taste, even when dipped in the sauce. The salad was dandelion leaves with balsamic vinegar, though the grilled pear that came with it was a nice touch.For mains, I ordered the paparadelle ragu ($25), which was ok. It was pasta with a sprinkling of lamb and mushrooms. I would have liked to order meat, but the meat mains are $38 (beef or seabass), which felt very overpriced.Service was friendly overall, and prompt. I didn't like that the waiter touched the eating end of the fork and spoon when handing it to us, but everything else was ok. Unfortunately for us that night, there was a large table of loud men drinking and shouting at the top of their voices. The waiter could do nothing about them, and they didn't stop even after we politely asked them to tone it down a little.The decor is contemporary, with wooden tables and chairs (no cushion)
4
was there for lunch once and i absolute loved their panini.went back with a friend for dinner and this time i could enjoy the cosy yet stilish ambiance they have.fast staff and well trained (rare in Singapore)good genuine food.I hope they will keep up and never lower their standart.only downside is their high bar chair on the terrace. they should have normal table
4
Probably one of the top 5 pizza places I have tried in Singapore. Note this is an authentic Italian pizza with a thin crust. Prices are probably high for that part of town but acceptable when compared to similar quality restaurants on the island...and you definitely want to book a table
4
My fianc√É¬© discovered this restaurant on his "look-see" trip before we moved to Singapore. He said he was having good pizza on Kandahar Street, which seemed improbable... But he was right. This is legit italian, with a wood burning pizza oven, in the middle of the Arab quarter of Singapore. Definitely try to sit outside or downstairs--the upstairs can get noisy. Enjoy
1
For those that love cheese in their pizza, beware that "Napoletana" pizza does not contain cheese.
The waitress rudely advised that it was stated in the menu when it wasn't.
Very disappointing!
5
This is a small lovely Italian restaurant close to Arab Street.
Simply best pizzas we have tried in Singapore.
Plus it is quite cheap.
A pretty rare combination in Singapore
4
Love the food and the ambiance at this place. Small little restaurant but the food has big flavour and the service is warm. There is upstairs seating as well if the tables are full but very limited. Make reservations to avoid being disappointed!
5
Having been meaning to try this place for a while (disappointing they are not open on Sundays) so glad I finally made it! We were greeted pleasantly and shown our table promptly, kind waiter even offered to take our picture....drinks orders came promptly and were nice. We started with a pumpkin salad and bruschetta - soooo delicious but simple. Fresh ingredients and well crafted. The buffalo margherita pizza, cooked in the wood fired oven was divine!! Definitely coming bac

Visited Cicheti for lunch with some colleagues. I loved the ambiance - rustic with wooden furniture and the rest of the decor also in different tones of wood. The lunch menu is pretty limited, which worked well as I wasn't spoilt for choice and confused as I usually am, looking at an exhaustive menu! One of my colleagues and I had the Panino de Caprese and another had the Panino de Pollo (a marinated chicken sandwich). The Caprese Panini was quite good - it came in a soft pizza base stuffed chockfull with well dressed Arugula, Pesto, succulent Buffalo Mozzarella, Cherry Tomatoes, & Pesto. There was also a generous accompaniment of Fries that were drizzled with a light dressing that had lemon and sugar in it, which gave them a very delicate and interesting flavour. The only downside was both the Panini and Fries had a little more salt than necessary. My other colleague said that his Chicken Panini was good too. To round off the meal (which incidentally left all of us stuffed!), we had the Salted Chocolate Brownie with Ice cream. The brownie was lovely, firm and slightly crisp on the outside and oozing salted molten chocolate! The ice cream was drizzled with salted caramel and the combination was explosively good.Service was timely and friendly too. I'd like to go back to check out their dinner options, so all in all, a definite winner
4
I have passed this restaurant several times in the past months and I came for lunch recently.The lunch menu is smaller than the dinner menu (which has an expanded small plates and pasta menu)We went for a pizza and pasta to give the food a try:- The Bismark Pizza: $23 - This was a tomato based pizza with buffalo cheese, mushrooms and bacon with a sunny side up egg in the middle. It is good. The pizza crust is unique with a slighhhtly chewy texture. I learnt from the manager that they rest the dough for at least 5 hours before using it to make pizza to order.- Rigatoni with Smoked Duck: $23 - This was my first time eating with smoked duck. I wished there were more pieces of smoked duck. There were also sliced sundried tomato in it. The sauce was more orangey, as they used tomato paste with cream in the sauce. Its good.There are items on the menu that I spotted that I am keen to try on my next visit, such as their small plates menu in the evenings and their Carbonara pizza.The quality of food is good and we will definitely be back here again.Recommended
5
We finally made it to Cicheti after hearing about it from a few different friends. Good food, service and ambience. We loved everything we ate - rucola salad w/ pear, mozzarella/tomato on bread, four cheese pizza, and the chocolate lava cake (excellent!) with the exception of the meatballs, which we won't be ordering again. my husband and i both had an aperitif and we order a nice bottle of wine - to our pleasant surprise the bill was quite reasonable, as wine usually pushes you over the reasonably priced mark when dining in Singapore. All-in-all a great experience and we already made our next reservation to come back with friends
4
We'd planned a mid-week dinner with friends at Kampong Glam Cafe but changed last minute when we walked past Cicheti. Very cute little restaurant in a quiet street. Extremely welcoming, attentive and informative staff. Pizza's were the highlight. Decent value for money also. We'll definitely be back. Looks liked booking ahead would be advisable
4
nice athmospere, honest food and decent wine selection! it might not be extremely faithful to the venetian cicheti but definitely a sort of little Venice in Singapore!good job guys, keep it up and looking forward to seeing more sharing food options!we will be back soon
5
Cicheti offers great Italian dishes with a edgy twist. The deep fried calamari comes beautifully breaded and the burratina -Parma ham- rucola plate was just right. But if you want traditional, the prawns in olive oil and garlic and the meatballs in roasted tomato sauce will definitely not disappoint.But we give our highest praise to the pizza -- light, slightly chewy, cooked in the wood fired oven to perfection. The toppings for the two we tried, Diavola and Carbonara, were superbly well balanced, rich, yet not overwhelming. The other dish that must be mentioned is the Cioppino, a seafood stew where everything was fresh in a lovely sweet tomato sauce. Bravo
2
Popped in for a late lunch today, ordered the Bismark Pizza and was very disappointed. Not cooked well, very little topping and was overpriced for what I got! Coffee and service was good.
4
Such a gem of a find. We went for lunch and enjoyed pizzas and a simple salad. Great atmosphere, good service and well priced.
5
I tried the place at the end of July, they do the best Pizza in Singapore in my opinion. Really great in every aspect. Good service and good food. it seems to be quite crowded so better book in advance
2
We had a Pizza Parma and a Caprese. Toppings on Pizza were fine but the Pizza dough was awful and miles away from a real Italian Pizza. They call it Neapolitana. I would rather compare it with a french Crepe dough. Get a proper dough and it will be fine
4
Was there last weekend for a meal with a friend.. We had the carbonara pizza and it was amazing ! Loved the fine details of the restaurant, the open kitchen and the wood oven ! Good service and the manager was always around to chat you up.
5
I went to Cicheti for a birthday dinner and can't wait to go back. The food was great! You can really tell an Italian cook in the kitchen, as the dishes are very authentic. The pizza was my favorite part of the meal. Cooked in a wood oven, it was thin, crispy, chewy and burnt it all the right ways. The toppings were great and they were very generous servings ($17-$19). We also split the calamari (a smaller portion, but reasonable for $11), and the burrata cheese (on special). The burrata was awesome and came with prosciutto, arugula, tomatoes, and a drizzle of balsamic glaze. Other plates included the tagliatelle gamberi ($23)...also very generous on the amount of prawns, and the vongole (was said to be a bit over salted).The prices were great overall considering the quality and serving sizes. I wouldn't even consider this a less expensive meal compared to most in Singapore. Also, alcohol was reasonably priced.Service was surprisingly good. Singapore is known for having terrible customer service, but each server here was very helpful, friendly, and attentive throughout the night. Very refreshing!I will be telling my friends and family to go here asap
5
Have been here a couple of times so far. Wood fired pizzas were excellent. The crusts were cooked to perfection. Not too thick, crispy and very fragrant. Give the starters a try, especially the fresh prawns with the chilli oil and the duo caprese. House pinot grigio was really nice and reasonably priced. The place is rather small and can be very packed and although upstairs seating is available, not everything on the menu is available when you sit on the second floor, which was a kind of a disappointment when my friends and I were there. All in all, great food and excellent service from Paul?(hope I got his name right...), the bartender upstairs, at an affordable price
5
Never expected Arab street area to have such a nice restaurant. The place was crowded for a Tuesday and buzzing. All Individual tables downstairs taken and a party upstairs. The patio had a beautiful view of the mosque.They recommend that dishes are shared. The meatballs were juicy in a rich tangy tomato sauce. The burratina with parma ham was fresh and creamy as it should be.We especially loved the sauce of the seafood ciopinno and the baked sea bass. The prawn pasta was also really tasty but it was a little dry and could have had more sauce. Finished the meal with a plain pizza which came from the woodfired oven crispy yet soft.The wine selection is rather small but we were very happy with the house Pino Grigio.Didn't try the desserts but will be back soon to do so
5
We were very surprised how fast the handmade pizza was baked. The pizza crusts are fragrant and chewy, unlike those found in other pizza food chains. The prawn pasta was perfectly cooked - prawns were very fresh and juicy, and the fragrance of prawns in the pasta makes it exceptionally appetizing. They took about 30+ minutes to serve our dessert, but served complimentary wine for the long wait. The salted chocolate lava cake dessert was legendary, and is a must-try! Words cannot describe how much we enjoyed our experience here. 100% will return in the future
5
Cicheti is a small restaurant with an edgy Italian themed decor. It's cozy, but can get pretty loud when crowded. The small plates are great starters. Try the duo caprese or bruschetta and the fresh prawns ($12). The chef made us a pizza of Gorgonzola with honeycomb which was fantastic. Our tenderloin was nothing special although the seafood broth, Cioppino was to die for.Our only suggestion is for a wider wine menu
4
Our office is just around the corner from Cicheti and we lunch there often and we've done take away pizzas lots and lots of times. We've been getting them to try out new salads with the freshly baked pizza dough bread and it has been really great !! I recommend you ask Chef Aun if he can stuff the pizza bread with a salad and a couple of meatballs. They are nice enough to us old customers who are looking for something new all the time.Best of all is that their prices are really fair for the fresh food they serve (which no other place in the vicinity can match)
5
This is a lovely little restaurant in the Arab street area of Singapore. It is small, so reservations are probably in order, although we did not have any. The decor is edgy. Now, on to the important stuff, the food! It was fantastic. Some of the best Italian food I've had - period. In Singapore, this is beyond great. I had the carbonara pizza, but as a vegetarian, I had them make it without bacon. It was divine. Very different and perfect. We also had the pear salad to begin, it was such a surprising and refreshing set of flavors. The chocolate lava cake was also delicious. As for prices, for Singapore- it wasn't that bad. My pizza was around $23
5
We live in Singapore but Cichetii was recommended by a friend from Hong Kong. Its so rare to find a place that serves great food, has great ambience and yet is so unpretentious. We had all the cichetis or small plates and it really filled us up. The prawns were so fresh as was the calamari. The Burratina from the specials board was delicious. We also shared the roasted sea bass done to perfection. Unfortunately no space for the great looking desserts. Ravi the manager and Ruth looked after us so well. We're going back again this week
4
We come from Bangkok where there is great food from all over the world. So we were very pleasantly surprised that the dinner at Cicheti was so enjoyable. We had the Pizza Carbonara and Diavola which were done perfectly with such a good balance of cheese and other toppings. The lamb ragu with homemade pasta had such a wonderful flavor and texture that we will definitely come back
1
My wife and I live in Singapore and tried this restaurant just on chance. We hadn't looked at the reviews at all so are shocked to see the rating based on our experience. We have two pizzas and although supposedly different they both tasted and looked the same. Also both were dripping wet. The bases burnt but the toppings wet and impossible to pickup and eat by hand. Actually these were the worst pizzas we've ever had.To make matters worse the service was aggressive. When we arrived we had two members of staff standing over us pushing for us to order at the same time. This was as we sat down. Then while we were still eating they started taking our plates .Just the worst evening and meal ever..
5
So good I had to share this. The cicheti meatballs, calamari and gamberi(prawns) were fresh and delicious. The lamb ragout was tender and the homemade pasta a perfect texture. Great funky urban ambience. We tried a plain pizza margarita and must say the dough had the right crispiness on the outside but nicely chewy on the inside. We were so full that we only had the salted chocolate cake which is really worth a return visit. All in all the best find we made on this trip through Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore
5
We found this restaurant by chance on our first night in Singapore.Rau looked after us as if we were they only ones there. Great atmosphere, pizzas looked great, meatballs to die for and the lamb ragout was excellent too.Deserts to die for.Would recommend and definitely go back
4
Went there for the second time in a larger group ... no regrets whatsoever.The restaurant is in a nondescript house in the Arab quarter of town, without even so much as a sign outside advertising itself. The area it is in, is of course full of places to eat and drink.Although technically an Italian restaurant, I would call the food fusion. The creativity of the owners clearly comes through in their dishes, from pasta to pizza. And keep enough place for dessert !!! It is simply delicious !!!The service is pleasant and handles any and all requests promptly and courteously. The bonus is the price - extremely reasonable. I can strongly recommend a visit here.Good job.Their website is - http://www.cicheti.co
4
The food at Cicheti really is delicious, especially the pizza, very authentic and cooked to perfection. If you like pizza and pasta then i wouldn't hesitate to recommend, the deserts were particularly nice too! This it a pretty relaxed place, not too expensive and it shows that care has been taken with everything from the food on the menu to the decor to the attentiveness of the waiting staff. Only reason that i don't give 5 stars is that we were sat upstairs and the tables for 2 really seem to be crammed in, you end up sitting about 2 feet apart from the tables either side of you
4
Food tastes really good. It's a small cozy pizza and pasta place near Arab street. Not much else on the menu so be sure you like that :-) thanks god they are both excellent. There is a really good vibe to it especially because you can watch them cooking the pizza right in front of you. Great for a date or a dinner with friends. Did not try deserts but they looked good in my neighbors' plate.
