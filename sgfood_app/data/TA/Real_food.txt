Though the service took quite some time, the dishes were really great. Not easy to find a vegan/vegetarian place with so many choices. Price tag appropriate.

Great place for healthy food conscious people ! Cosy place with the sofas and a nice design. The service is sometimes slow. The dumpling soup is excellent ! Some range of gluten-free dishes as well. A place to recommend definitively !

Terrific Healthy FoodAte there on my own on a Thursday evening. Arrived at 7 and was immediately seated at a communal high table, which was fine by me (other seating looked comfy - lounge-style). The menu offered SO many terrific choices - at least half a dozen vegetarian burgers, and pages of other options too, including a lovely mix of Singaporean-oriented dishes as well as Western-style trendy health foods. Food was delicious and I ate far more than I intended. The service was friendly and efficient - happy to offer guidance when I was faced with too many great choices. Wish I'd found it earlier in my trip as I'd have eaten as many meals there as I could
4
Good service and huge variety of choice which can cater to every taste in the family. Prices vary - some dishes are value, others expensive. Food is cooked with great flavour, so it is not a plain health food joint. Atmosphere is relaxed with books around though the health focus may overwhelm some.

I would like to bring it to everyone's attention that this please is a scam with zero health and safety standards in place. You find different sort of things in food. Dangerous.Claim it to be organic however I doubt. Management is pretty useless and arrogant as did nothing when we highlighted the issues

We are vegetarians and struggle to get a decent meal at most restaurants even in this day and age. There are never really many options for vegetarians. So Real food was like a boon. They have so many options and we were a group of 5 this time and we tried 7-8 dishes. Boy was each good or what! Full of flavours and additionally each dish tasted so fresh. They used herbs and fresh sauces. Tried the portobello stuff mushroom, veggie pasta and pizza. Steamed dumplings (were a bit thick coated and chewy compared to the Clarke Quay branch).Tom yum curry was also so great. I am definitely going back and taking friends along. Keep it up Real food!! this one is different from the clarke Quay one in terms of the wait staff comes to your table to take the order vs there you have to go to the counter to order. this is more upmarket and they have a big section on fresh produce and organic food etc whcih can also be purchased. The wait staff seemed new and a bit zapped though :

Discovered this place and went back several times within a two week period. Wonderful clean food, the vega wonton noodle soup a real highlight. Paired with a massive apathy about service. If this place could deliver two breakfasts inside 15mins I'd be happy, but the general wait time (even in an empty restaurant) is 30mins.Gives you a long time to sit and watch all the people in the kitchen and wonder what they're doing. Great food though.

This is the 5th time that I've been to their new location at Orchard Central. I have an anaphylactic allergy to gluten and wheat and struggle to find food options. I make time to come here and each time I've visited, they are out of their only gluten free breakfast option - banana pancakes. They did offer their yogurt though. I find it extremely upsetting that they advertise gluten, dairy, wheat and soy free options, but constantly do not have menu items available! When they were at Killiney Road, they always had a delicious GF waffle and NEVER did they run out. I'm not sure if management has changed or if they're unsure how to make adequate grocery lists anymore, but either way, it's disappointing. I did not enjoy my meal as a result of this.
5
Just had my first visit here the other day for lunch and found the menu choices for vegetarians and vegans to be excellent. Our meal was of very high quality and the service excellent. Cooked fresh to order so don't go if you are short of time

@TheKuoKnowsThis place is quite an eye-opener for anyone who simply enjoys good food that is served and eaten at a leisurely pace.Real Food used to be situated towards the middle of Killeney Road. But it is now housed in swanky Orchard Gateway, where it can better showcase its unique relaxed eating style.Organic Fried Rice might not seem like a big deal. But Real Food has managed to turn an unassuming dish into something quite rich. Ask for a dish of their chillie sauce. It'll blow your mind.What can you do withmushrooms? You could always turn it into a Mushroom Burger, which the restaurant does perfectly. The sourdough bun is quite exquisite. The Sweet Potato Fries are fab. Ask for a dish of their tomato ketchup, which I am told is homemade.If you are not in a rush, then Real Food is perfect. Take your iPad or laptop with you. You should have enough time to write a thousand-word article before your food turns up!No one appears to be in any rush at Real Food.....because Real Food should be eaten Real Slow

Came here for dinner with my friends and it was right beside my workplace! Love the ambience and lighting here! We ordered the dumpling wanton noodle and soup. Love the noodles!!! Would definitely recommend to my friends :)
5
Continues to be a total gem! Can never tire of this place. The vive is just so infectious. Could spend the entire day lounging around. Unfortunately they do not have wifi.
5
been here twice. Has a large warehouse type feel inside (in a good way). They have magazines to sit down and read while you wait for food.
Like their beetroot and croquette burgers, omlette and pastas.
4
Have been looking for places like Real Food that serves simple food that goes down the gut well. It is in fact harder to make simple food taste good and folks at Real Food have done it well. Will definitely visit again!
4
I was happy to see that there is a veggie restaurant near by. I tried the smoothie and veggie dumplings two nights straight after work! They are both delicious and fulfilling.
The staff is very nice as well!
5
Real Food at Killiney Road is one of these places where I would like to eat every day and would probably never get tired of it. I love the juices and the freshly prepared dishes and the raw desserts are to die for! A big recommendation for everyone who likes to chip in a healthy option from time to time - which is especially needed often also when are you travelling
5
This place did from the outside not look much, but the food was really a surprise.Stopped there while walking through Singapore and actually trying to find a grocery store that has something healthy on the shelf.This place is a mix of store and restaurant , while the products they sell seem to be rather on the expensive side.I went for a cappuccino , a smoothie and some pasta. Cappuccino excellent, smoothie was really good even with me not being used to have avocado in one and the pasta was great too. Prices for the food and drinks are Singapore standard , no complaints there.They have a lot of seating space , so it is a good place to meet friends , relax or do some work.
5
Nice ambience with a cool reading corner and lotsa organic stuff to buy, though most of it is rather pricy. The dumpling soup, lentil soup and portobello mushroom burger are my favourites. Service is generally quite prompt and low on the typical passive aggression of local eateries
4
I keep going back here. The food is excellent and fresh. The sustainability theme of this place is great so I'll keep going back. Well done guys. My only comments are1.) better service. It's all self service now and there really is no smiles from the staff ever. 2.) a small glass of water is 50c. Really? Tap water for 50c3.) I'd love to see more gluten free options. Like a gluten free bread would be great. Otherwise the food is great, give the hot cacao a try.
3
The concept is great: good clean healthy food. The space is nice, despite the mentions of being 4,000 square feet, it feels cosier than that.The food though was just ok or below average. The dishes we tried did not have much taste. We love vegetarian food but vegetarian food does not have to be tasteless. As for the service...what service? Long waiting times at every touch point (order, payment, service at the table) and not a single apology about the delay. Will definitely not visit unless a few things change. A pity as the idea and location are good. If properly executed, this place can be great. I hope they do improve, Singapore does need a few good quality, healthy food places
1
Very slow and poor service. Ok food. Not value for price and takes forever to get the basic food orders
5
It's a great place with great food. Huge selection and big portions. There is also a shop selling healthy food and cosmetics.
There is lots of space and comfortable sofas to relax and get rest.
5
Definitely useful when you're looking for organic yet local cuisine! Real food cafe is a treat for Vegetarian, Organic lovers or Gluten intolerant guests. Their menu is really diverse, and you end up going there every day of your trip!

I was in Singapore on a business trip for two weeks and this gem - Real Food was recommended by my client. We had our business lunch meeting at this place having great ambiance, great seating arrangements, great interiors, friendly staff and quick service. Just loved the place, the food and I started having a meal here almost everyday during my stay in Singapore. I love their organic Cola, Pastas, Pizzas, Burger and almost everything they serve. Can't wait to be back and try their other dishes.

I tend to enjoy the fresh ingredients at this restaurant and I like the overall ethos but it's hard not to get frustrated by the slow service and tedious ordering system. It's as if the place is run by over-enthusiastic students who care more about saving the planet than serving their customers. Of all three branches, Killiney is the worst. Talk about making you work for your lunch! There is was nobody manning the cash desk when we arrived in the store. Instead, one of the chefs yelled at us from the kitchen to take a menu and find a table on the other side of the shop. After waiting forever to catch a server's attention, we were then informed that we must leave our table and place our food order back at the cash desk. This meant navigating our way back through the tables, through the shop and back to the main entrance. Fearful of losing our table and/or belongings in the now out of sight restaurant, I left my poor friend to join the long queue of people waiting to place their order with a single harried cashier. As the queue got longer it became clear that many of the dishes were unavailable. In my case they'd run out of shiitake mushrooms for the Kombu soup and my friend was unable to have the Tom Yum soup. This meant my friend (and most other customers) had to return to the restaurant to ask their friends to select a second choice. Having finally placed and paid for our orders, we asked the server for a glass of water. The flustered waitress explained it was 50 cents for a glass of tap water and we would need to return to the cash desk to pay for it. This whole meal was now turning into a farce. I pointed to the length of the queue and asked the waitress if she would be so kind to take my 50cents to the till for me. She did so reluctantly and came back with a half filled glass of tepid water.After a long wait, our meals finally arrived. In the absence of soup, I settled for the egg and potato salad, which for $10.80 consisted of a small handful of spinach leaves, a tiny smear of feta cheese and no sign at all of the promised tomatoes, olives and roasted nuts. My friend's salad was equally thin on the ingredients stated in the menu.Running late, we finished our meals and walked back to the shop entrance hoping to share some feedback about our poor experience. This time, there were no staff to be found at the till or behind the serving counter so we left the shop hungry and disgruntled, vowing to vent our spleen on TripAdvisor and never to return
2
Went there twice now, today for lunch being the second time. Arrived at 1:30pm, placed my order for food and a juice and was not given a "number" (Which helps identify the diner when the order is being brought to them) as last time. I queried this and the girl at the till told me not to worry. At 1:50pm no juice had been served, nor was there any sight of the food, so I went back to the front area to enquiry. The guy making juices immediately went off to make my juice, but 5 mins later I was informed by someone in the kitchen that I was "still in the queue" and it would take another 30 mins for my food to be ready! That means I would have to wait 55 (!!) minutes from placing my order until I would (perhaps) be served!! At no time during placing the order was I informed that it could take this long, otherwise I would have never agreed to it. This is completely unacceptable and I therefore demanded to be refunded on the spot and have my order cancelled, which they did.The food that I had the first time around was not too bad at all, but the place is seriously under-staffed. Even during the first time there was only one waiter looking after all the tables. This time there were more staff around, but as you can see it still takes them forever to process the orders. I shall not return, as the place is completely disorganised and it would ruin my mood, even if the food appears to be quite good

I live nearby this restaurant and go there at least once or twice a week.+Affordable comparable to Singapore pricesQuality vegetarian food, although sometimes not consistentDesigner, stylish, relaxing environmentSelection of veggies and foods to buy-Opening hoursCannot order at tableFreezing temperatures at time

Hidden away on Killiney rd. Around the corner from Somerset MRT station and only 1m walk from Orchard road I found this great vegan and vegetarian restaurant. These people excellent food and a relaxing spacious dimly lit environment. The restaurant also offers books and magazines to read and a wide variety of kitchen supplies, produce and refrigerated or packaged consumables. They also sell some health packages such as liver cleanse and body detox etc. I see many people just chilling here for hours reading a book.Good quality food comes at a slightly high price so don't treat this place like a fast food joint or your standard cafe. Portions are medium sized, drinks are in my opinion on the small side but amazingly fine.No free Wifi which is very odd and I would expect it in such a place. You also have to order at the counter now whereas before they would take your order.The place always has clients but is never packed so reservations are not necessary.The focus for sure is: quality healthy foo
2
This was one the first restaurants my boyfriend and I visited in Singapore and I have to say it was the worst. I started off with some quinoa milk, which tasted like dish water and sadly I could not get through it. For food I had a chickpea and sweet potato pattie salad. I'm not usually fussy but this was incredibly dry and took me a long while to get through.To be completely frank, all of this would have been acceptable but the gentleman who served us at the till was incredibly rude and bad mannered, it was extremely off putting. Given that they don't serve you at your table, I see no reason why he couldn't be helpful at the till
2
The food at this vegetarian eatery is hit-and-miss: the muesli is very good; salads are OK; the tom yum soup way too spicy and sweet at the same time (so does not taste like tom yum in a Thai restaurant), the pasta aglio olio lacks flavour. They push the concept of nature conservation to extremes: no toothpicks, kitchen towels instead of napkins, and tap water is charged by the glass with no refill
2
This review pertains specifically to Real Food at Killiney Road. We're still very happy with the food and service at the other branches (such as Central and Novena). We used to frequent this branch at Killiney due to its proximity to our favorite haunt. Unfortunately, the service standards has dropped dramatically and some items are perpetually unavailable (the missing manuka-honey a pet peeve of my friends). Avoid
5
Fresh organic vegetarian food. Felt like home..good menu..we had bruschetta- aubergine was the best, mushroom toasted like dried mushrooms very strong smell and flavour. I had carrot and orange juice- small and warm. Would have preferred a tall glass with some ice. Don't come here if you want quick food, waiting is considered to be part of the 'organic' preparation. Expensive for Singapore but the same as home
4
Excellent waffle pancakes (gluten-free option) and mushroom bruschetta. Good dumpling soup and vermicelli w/ garlic & chilli. Best organic cafe in Singapore with chill surroundings, but no service. Water is charged at $0.50 per glass or $2.00 per pitcher (opt for the pitcher). I prefer the living room seating (cozier) to the main dining room
4
It was a delight to finally discover a good vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. I really cannot fault the food or juices we had, they were excellent. Some reviews have said it was expensive but I would disagree. Singapore is an expensive city and considering you can easily pay $20 for some bland noodles and vegetables in any number of supposedly nice restaurants here, I am more than happy to pay and get absolutely delicious and, nourishing food. Would definitely return and recommend. Staff and service was decent enough.
5
Once in a while you find a restaurant which stands head & shoulders over its competitors, Real Food is one such restaurant. Who says veg food is boring, these guys will prove you wrong - Fresh, crispy delicious salad, followed by dumplings & noodles. Of course, they have a much wider choice & a variety of fresh organic veggies to take home. Will definitely on my next trip to a Singapore
5
If you're looking for a guilt-free and at the same time delicious food, you might want to head down to this cafe.I came across this place when I was searching for "organic" restaurant in Singapore.Fast forward to the first visit last year, it was the time I realized eating healthy can be delicious. I ordered their pan cake and boy, I kept coming back for more (separate visits of course!).I tried their other food and drinks too and it's very satisfying. Though the service is a bit slow, which is understandable as they only prepare your food once it's ordered, it is worth the wait.Try out this cafe y'all.
5
Cool little place with lots of quiet space and excellent organic vegetarian food and great smoothies. I don't have a lot to add on the below reviews other than to say that I have been waiting for years for a great little place like this to open. TRY IT
4
I come here a few times a month. It's chilled out so you can go alone and sit on the couches, read a book (they have a library on spiritual, health & self-help books you can choose from), go with friends, or you can even conduct casual business meetings. Pretty expensive for healthy food but on par with Singapore standards.Fried vermicelli with chili and garlic, dumpling soup, baked quinoa, ABC juice and lavender soy milk are my favorites
4
This is a great restaurant that also includes a shop where you can buy an assortment of packaged and fresh vegetarian and organic foods. The restaurant is quite large with an assortment of chairs and tables with benches and stools also. There is quite an extensive menu including soups, starters and mains and a limited selection of deserts. They also do freshly made juices. There are lots of options and the meals are always very tasty. As someone who is not vegetarian, this is a great mid priced restaurant
5
This place is not too far from orchard roadI have been here with my friends so many times and we just love this place so much. I am the only vegetarian in my friend circle, however whenever I ask my friends to join me for lunch at real food, they just wont say no.. The ambience is superb and very cozy with a very different concept. You can spend hours there and read books. Singapore needs some more places like this. I have tried their dumplings and they are the best I have ever tasted in singapore. I vouch for this place and for every traveller visiting orchard who would want to try on some vegetarian stuff, this place is nice to visit.For the vegans and vegetarians... I say its a must go place and should be a part of ur to do list. This place closes early in the evening by 9pm maybe.. so do plan accordingl

Singapore is severely lacking places like this, and I am glad this place as sprung up. The decor is simple, spacious, inviting and feels authentic about the clean eating/ vegetarian theme. Us, a group of four- a local who brought us there and three Australians- enjoyed the atmosphere, the books, the little grocer and the Breakfast Banana Oat Thickie!As an Australian, I am starting to see how we are spoiled for choice when it comes to fresh, healthy food options. As much as Real Food is indeed simple and fantastically organic, I was not overly impressed with my Rise-n-Shine Breakfast which was essentially average in taste. My partner had the Stuffed Vegie and felt better for it after days of hawker food. We thought it was good but we wouldn't rave about it.I would definitely go back to Real Food, but may stick to the noodles/ soups for taste
3
I've been here many times, most recently, yesterday. This place is all vegetarian and the food is pretty decent- light and fresh. It's also not expensive and there is both a western and asian selection. What bugs me about the place though is the service. I think they can't decide whether they want to be a self-service restaurant or a full-service one (or something in between). And if it's not full service, they haven't explained it well to the customer. Sometimes I'm not sure if they're simply busy or just rude. Or they just don't care. Oh yes, they don't provide napkins and if you don't ask for water, you don't get any.
4
Like: This particular branch is the most spacious and it gives a warm cosy feel with books for you to browse at your own time. There is even a headphone at one corner to listen to a few pieces of relaxing music. I tried the pizza and pan fried potatoes, very tasty.Dislike: Not all staff in the restaurant has the right disposition to serve customer
3
The environment is awesome which give me a calm and relax minded after a long journey of walk. The food overall there is organic , I am vegetarian, it is very healthy food but however the price is too pricey and not worth for that food value
3
I've eaten here every time i travel for work, but this time around i found their service to be in need of improvement.When i ordered a pancake for breakfast, they had no banana's which is the main ingredient. She asked if apples were okay instead and i said yes, which was fine.Then i returned at lunch to order a salad to take away, she said it would have 15 minutes. When i went back after 15min to pick up the salad, she then said 'sorry we don't have the ingredients' which was a bit of an inconvenience. Firstly she should have told me what was not on the menu, and secondly, making me go back only to find they didn't have ingredients was a bit unprofessional. And this all happened on a monday, i don't understand why a cafe that serves businesses in a busy street doesn't have groceries for its meals
5
This is the kind of place that should exist in every city / town by law! Fortunately, there are more and more of these opening all over the world to provide saatvik, wholesome, comfort food in a comfortable environment, at down to earth prices. Real Food in Singapore has 3 locations, but this one is the largest, and in a quiet location, yet right off bustling Orchard Road. There is an attached grocery store as well as shelves full of books to sit and browse. Menu is quite extensive and varied, and leans towards vegan though not exclusively vegan. The pesto sandwich on herbed focaccia served with roasted sweet potatoes was out of the world. So was the piping hot dumpling soup. There are fresh juices galore. The only downside for me was that I like my tea / coffee with milk, and they do not offer that.But more power to more Real Foods. In this tamsik world, it is a balm for soothing the frayed nerves
4
I had lunch with my friend at Real Food, I had the soup dumplings, for 8,50$. Dumplings were very good (about 6 in the soup) as well as the broth. Next time I'll take dumplings only (you have more !). Dumplings were very good and tasty ! Nice decoration and atmosphere inside, lots of seatings - will come back, definitively 
4
We've made a few visits to this place and like the food.The food is always fresh, and there's just enough variety on the menu to please almost everyone. The dishes are full of flavour, without being overpowering, and one always comes out feeling full and satisfied.The atmosphere is relaxed, with a modern "attic" style decor and seating.The only minor complaint is that speed of service varies a lot. We've had excellent service when it has been packed and busy, yet really slow service when we've been in during off-peak hours. So be prepared - i think the food makes it worth putting up with.
5
I've eaten at Real Food many times as its close to our office, but todays breakfast pancake just blew my mind, so i had to write a review.Its a organic cafe, so in terms of quality of food, i'd say its the best I've had in Singapore (and its my 3rd time here). The prices are fair and the cafe is nice and large, with plenty of magazines and books to browse while you wait. They also sell organic groceries.Back to the pancake, it was wheat free and gluten free so i really wasn't sure what to expect. Instead i served a massively thick and fluffy pancake (with hidden banana's) topped with strawberries and banana pieces, covered in agave syrup. And it was amazing!!I am staying in a 5 star hotel and their morning pancakes don't even come close to this.If you are within the area, i would highly recommend you dine here at least once
4
I love this place because its food, organic vegetables available for purchase and its people! I would have rated this place excellent except for the fact that the quinoa-lentil burger needs to congeal a little more - tried it twice already to do a comparison test. I would recommend putting some flax seed meal as an egg substitute. I use it myself. The food price is exorbitant but then this is Singapore! I am simply thankful that a colleague of mine, Ben, suggested this place to me. The ambiance, the service and the most friendliest people on earth work here...they are Filipinos! Yup! I am a little biased since I am Filipino. Overall, I am glad Singapore has several awesome wholesome vegetarian places like Real Food
3
Overall average. The place is easily accessible and has a decent variety of food which don't all taste the same.
I have a soft corner for the fried rice. The prices are on the higher side, but I guess that's to be expected.
4
Healthy, wholesome and tasty vegetarian meals made of real food and recognisable ingredients are hard to come by. I'm a vegetarian and this place is a gem. Love the classy and relax ambience with books and magazines at easy reach. Try the dumpling soup and pineapple french toast - keeps me going back! :

I ate at Real Food Killiney Road on a Sunday evening with friends. The restaurant itself is lovely inside, really spacious and has a nice vibe. However, the staff seem to be run off their feet and really unhelpful. We struggled to get their attention and our order took a while to come. The food itself was really nice - I had the beetroot burger and others had pasta. My gripe with this place is that you have to pay for tap water. I have eaten in hundreds of restaurants around the world and never in my life have I had to pay for tap water. It's outrageous. In a lot of countries it's illegal not to serve water. In case you're wondering what the price of said tap water is it's $0.50 a glass or $1.50 per jug. Oh and they don't give you free refills - you have to pay.Although I enjoyed the food and it's 5 minutes walk from my house I probably won't be back. I just can't justify paying for tap water. Ridiculous
4
I'm a regular here by myself as many friends refuse to eat wholesome vegetarian food. My favorites are steamed dumpling, stuffed portobello, and their eggs are delicious! I like it because I can read magazines as food is prepared slowly, I can browse the "health food store" that's right there too.Delightful place to chill and unwind
1
Wife and I were tired from shopping and decided to take a short break. Saw this cafe and we walked right in. Firstly, no one came to serve us to we found a table and just plonked ourselves down. Looked through the menu and there wasn't anything interesting to eat. Staff were not unfriendly but they were not friendly either. I ordered the only coffee on the menu whilst the missus ordered a juice. The missus liked her juice but my coffee was worst than the type you get from Coffee & Toast, Ya Kun etc etc. It was diluted with no real coffee taste and I'm not even a fussy drinker. I like most types of coffee. To top it all off, my coffee was served in a cracked cup. I took pictures of this and will attempt to upload it through my mobile. Overall, will never ever step foot into that cafe again. I was kind enough to tell the waiting staff that the coffee cup has a huge crack at the bottom and all she said was "oh…". There wasn't a hint of an apology at all. People who serve organic and healthy food actually do care about health. It doesn't seem like this joint cares about its customers or the food & drinks they put in front of us
5
Really good cafe, good staff and excellent variety of vegetarian food. A lot of vegetarian restaurants tend to have different dishes which end up tasting the same - not this place! Also good for non-vegetarians. The food is very flavourful so no meat is required! Juices were also great and different, and the healthy ice blocks are a great snack in a hot climate. Went here several times and had also ordered takeaways. When the place was busy, the service was still prompt which was nice to see. Would definitely go back
5
Fresh Real Fully Organic Food made by cheerful people- yes please! Good going Singapore! Having traveled across the world for good organic raw vegan desserts, finally I have found the best. The Chocolate Bliss square bar is really the best tasting chocolate dessert also the smoothest I have ever tasted. (It is dehydrated...but still raw) Do not leave Singapore without having tried one. When I travel I take some with me on the road. They keep beautifully. Another favourite is the gluten-free pancake...OMG! Just do it! I also loved the fresh salads, they have some wonderful suppliers. Also comes with a store, the bigger one at the Killiney Location, where you can buy anything from bamboo ware to organic make up! Spreading the love, thank you Real Food
5
The location is perfect, in Clarke Quay's "central" (shopping plaza). The décor is nice; modern, chic. I liked it. There are a couple of communal tables, and the rest scattered throughout. The lighting at the tables, however, I found a bit to harsh, slightly inquisitorial and in your eyes. No biggie, though.The staff is the nicest. Lyn was the first I met, who welcomed me after a tiring flight from Indonesia, and a quick check-in at the Parkroyal on Pickering, a beautiful hotel around the corner, a good place to stay if you want to be close to Real Food. She is wonderful, an excellent waitress and person, talkative, friendly, humorous and kind. During my weekend stay, I came for each meal.Food is incredible. Almost unsurpassed, in my experience. And I've been everywhere for veg food; LA, SF, Bali...DO NOT SKIP THIS PLACE! You will love me forever if you go
4
I celebrated with my girlfriend on her last day of being an employee. As expected, the ambience and food quality were up to par. While the yummy Banana Pancake (under S$10) is my usual choice, this time I sampled the Spicy Aglio Olio Spaghetti which tasted marvellous too. The spaghetti was both light to my taste buds and healthy. My better half ate Fried Quinoa which was nice and more filling than my spaghetti. If you are sourcing for a quiet yet conducive venue that dishes out healthy delicious food without burning a hole in the pocket, Real Food is the place
4
We were staying close by and were exploring the area. We found this by chance as it does not have a huge street profile. We had the vegetarian breakfast, and it was wonderful. Eggs cooked perfectly, and the mushrooms divine. And I mustn't forget the freshly squeezed juices. That touch of ginger just made the difference. Well done! And much better value that some other breakfast places close by
