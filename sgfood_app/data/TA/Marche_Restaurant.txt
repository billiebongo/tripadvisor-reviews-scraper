Since I’m on a rush, a one quick stop in Marché will definitely give you a good feeling in the morning.
I love sandwich and their roasted beef is a must. :)
5
Just inside the Orchard Shopping Centre/ Orchard Gateway complex, this was a great find opposite Costa Coffee.
Delicious pastries at very reasonable prices
5
Had breakfast here twice in 3 days. Excellent bircher muesli, pizza and sandwiches! Very fresh, great service and good coffee. Great choice for a quick snack or meal.
5
Really like their freshly baked breads, especially their cinnamon sugar and raisin zoff. Airy, fluffy and yummy! Great to get them as breakfast for the next day.

One of the concepts of restaurants which blown my mind away when I first tried it out in 2011 that time... was just AMAZING - now after 7 years stll the same place and same quality food and drinks. Only little issue I would say the alcohol is very expensive if u wanna have it inside but the food such a nice presentation and delicious flavours u will never forget... like mama cooking for you... is not a GOURMET place ATTENTION... is just a place where you can eat home made food and fresh ingredients. I wont tell you about the crepes with mascarpone and strawberries and fresh caramel icecreammmm mama miaaaa! Gr8 :D a 5 stars for the concept

Few restaurants provide a dining concept as interesting and interactive as Marche at Somerset. Over the years, Marche at Somerset has held its own unique position in a competitive and vibrant F&B market in Singapore.We dined at Marche on a weekday night. It was comfortably busy without the weekend crowds and long queues at the various live cooking stations. We shared orders of rosti with salmon, and BBQ pork knuckle. Dinner was completed with Movenpick ice cream and coffee. Enjoyable dinner indeed
3
All our multiple trips to Singapore we were visiting Marche very and very often. It used to be brilliant place to eat. For about 2 years we were not traveling to Singapore and now we hear again and Marche is not the same. Bad service (for example, you would have to wait for your coffee for 10 mins without any Q in an empty restaurant just because in the middle of making it manager would decide to give instructions about deserts and will be talking to the barista without any hurry while you will be standing and looking at you half-done cappuccino) Everything looks dirty and worn out and that smell!!! It never smelled in Marche and now you smell this kitchen and smells are not nice We didn’t eat this time. Just left. So I put 3 out of 5 just because it used to be good a while ago
5
That what I came here for. It’s the only station with a queue and you can’t get it anywhere else in Singapore. There’s something here for everyone. My daughter has the pasta. Ingredient here are fresh, cooked on the spot and you have the choice of payment for what you eat, instead of a buffet
5
Visited marche in suntech city as well as vivo previously and ordered similar food, we reckoned somerset's pork knuckle was the best. Not too dry, not too much fat and the gravy that came with the german platter was delicious. You should try the choc crepe too, one of the best in town
4
Restaurant was comfortable. Decoration was unique and homely .Tried the lamb rack...$20 for 2 piece of rack... taste ok. Tried the calamari rings. $14 I think... flour is too thick and oily Tried the mix juice. This is really good ! On the way to cashier... saw the butter place near to ground exposed. This area has high human walking frequency.. it will be good for the restaurant to cover up the butter.. Overall a nice experience dining here .
4
The decoration is beautifully done and the food is tasty as well.
A great place to dine with friends as each of them can pay for their own food without the need to have someone pay first and then dividing the bill up.
5
Very food, tasty food. Gets crowded between 1130 to 0130 afternoon. Be watchful of large families visiting with Pram ! Don’t miss their Paella. Food is little costly although. Marche not to be missed for western food lovers. I go for the crepes mainly !
4
Great little spot for breakfast. Very good value. Bacon and egg croissant and coffee for $10 and both were great. Will come back again
5
It is a great place to good with awesome ambience. The food is good. The place is value for money. I tried Rosti and fresh juice. It was nice. They have an awesome collection of salads also.
5
This is my favourite restaurant in Singapore. Every time I come to Singapore I need my Marche fix at least twice! Great plastic card system for ordering. Great selection of food & drinks, so something for everyone. I just love the feel & vibe in this market style restaurant. A must visit when in Orchard Road
5
On my visits to see my family in Singapore this is a must for my five year old grand daughter who loves the pizzas and the small play area in equal measure!Fortunately her mother and I love the variety of delicious fresh food so we’re always happy to oblige
4
Marche is a really nice place for lunch or dinner to visit once in a while. The variety of food is good and food itself is fresh. I had a lunch set which was boiled beef with mashed potatoes. The beef was tender and the potato was savory
5
we were tired from doing shopping. we saw the entrance and secided to see what is downstair. we loved the concept. food were presented very well. we enjoyed the pasta and the salad. we tried the chicken also and it was good. we will definitely be back.
5
Marche is one of the diamonds in Singapore if you love European food. They have a wide selection of German and Swiss as well as Italian and French food. I love love love the design of the restaurant that looks like a Marche with all the frech ingredients are decorated around the cooking stations. So its great fun to eat here with friends - since every one can choose the food that he likes.But also the breakfast with the fresh bread and the great scrambled eggs and bacon are perfect. We had here some nice time while staying in Singapore
5
Visited for dinner and wasn’t disappointed. You get issued a card and then you are shown your seat then you can go off and select your delights. We enjoyed a pizza and pasta dish with some veges. It was very yummy, not on the cheap side as far as eating in Singapore goes but good quality food.
5
Wow what an experience!
The choices are endless, the ability to tailor your selected dining option is fantastic. Great for all young & old...
A must visit for a great meal!
5
Well yes -I get a cozy feel here and being vegetarians -we have enough to feel good - esp deserts ---good place to eat anytime of the day - will feel you are in Switzerland! !-enjoy rosti! !
4
If you like the sight of lots of food, lots of greens and fruits that will get to your table, this is it! Amazing selection and recommended for Holiday Brunches. Helpful staff.
4
You know what's good, it's the rosti! Long queues from that counter there! Portion given were reasonable!
3
Lots of food choices. Didn't have to queue up for a long time which is good because we came at dinner time. Staff friendliness can still be improved though. Everyone was too busy with their own tasks an in chatting with another staff.
2
Price was way too high for the quality food that came with it.
While the ambiance did feel good along with the live cooking stations, certain items of food were outrageously bad.
Steak was too chewy, fish wasn't fresh.
3
The place is nice, away from the crowd of 313. However, the pricing is tad too high. Variety is ok . It can be better.
5
Marche does everything perfectly - ambience, food, service and value for money. It's the perfect place to indulge in some delicious desserts and enjoy a lovely evening with friends.

I had a hankering for some western food after having spent 7 days eating local food. Not that I minded cuz I grew up on it but variety is the spice of life.Anyway I walked by the Marche by Movenpick so I decide to try it. I walked into the downstairs restaurant and was given the lunch specials for the week and a credit card. I was a little confused but soon figured out the process. Simply go to any of the food stations and order your food, drink or dessert. Hand over the card and the charges are added into it. Then find yourself a table and start eating. When you are done walk to the exit and hand over the card to the cashier. He will figure out what you owe and after paying you are on your way.Firstly the process was easy enough to figure out by watching others. Secondly some of the food stations can have pretty long lines and you might have to wait a while for you turn. Thirdly, the food was pretty good but a little too salty but that could be the dish I ordered (Swiss Rosti with salami and tomato chutney). Fourthly service is mostly absent as it was all self serve.I would give it 3.5 stars if I could and I would try some of the other dishes next time
4
Visited this restaurant at the insistence of our daughter who likes Swiss food as well.It takes a bit of a time to understand the lay out of the restaurant and not much help in this regard came from anyone from the restaurant. Various varieties of food have been organised as different stalls which is quite systematic but the whole restaurant looked cramped! Or is this the way Swiss restaurants normally are? I am not wiser as I am yet to visit Switzerland to find out.The onion soup quantity was quite generous and I loved the home made juice of various fruits.Prices seemed to be reasonable for Singapore standards!But maybe I am not used to such food which dis-incentivises me for a repeat visit
5
We have eaten here many times over the years and love it. You wander from serving area to serving area, selecting among tantalizing fresh dishes, including many from Switzerland. Some great beers on tap. Delicious...and not economical. The staff is friendly.
4
A different kind of restaurant where you get Swiss food made to order in front of you. Works also for european style breakfast.
5
We stumbled upon this very cool eatery completely by chance ! The food was exceptional as was the experience a very cool place to eat with our boys ! If you get a chance definitely check it out !
5
My favorite restaurant near Sentosa Island. Very colorful, too much variety of food and tasty. You must try after Sentosa Island or Universal Studios.
5
From first view we thought this was a small sandwich shop/cafe, however there is a restaurant downstairs which is actually like a market where you go up to different stalls and choose your food. Love this idea! So much more fun than ordering from a menu. You pay for everything at the end. The food was also really nice. Really clean, cool and comfortable break from the hot city.
5
Loved this place as it provides different kind of food options to choose from.I visited this place on recommendation of my brother. This place serves European cuisine and does bakery items as well. This place had nice ambience with loads of seating area. It is a limd pf buffet place where you pay separately for each item you pick. With too many choices one can get easily spoilt and confused what not to take. Since we visited with family, we decided to order different dishes so we can taste more dishes.My favourite picks were:Pork ribs( very juicy )Blueberry cheesecake Spanish rice dish Paella - loved itFennel tea ☕️ When in SG and want to try some authentic European cuisine and not the usual indian or sg local cuisine, visit this place with your family and loved ones. Place is good for a romantic date as well
5
Often pop in here with a Friend in the evening.Fun decoration Swiss style! Like the concept of putting the cost on the card you are given on entering the restaurant and paying at the end.Excellent choice of salads,pasta,potatoes,sausages,soups etc Plus the desserts! Good aircon,staff leave you to linger over coffee if you want.Not noisy and good location
4
It is very difficult to find a sandwich take away in Singapore. Marche has take away counter at the restaurant entrance. Excellent choice of sandwiches, pastries & bread. Slightly expensive but compared to what you get from Subway, worth it. Also good change if you are fed up with local fare
4
Besides of it's great location which is conveniently located at Somerset MRT, we love the food and the interior! Much more option of food you can have, be it for your children, your parents and of course yourself. Whenever I want to have a clean eat dinner, I will go to Marche and order their fish with bunch of salad. It taste good and warmly acceptable in my tummy haha
4
This is located conveniently at the MRT station of SOMERSET which is in the middle of ORCHARD Road. It is located in the basement of 313, & it is a big place with plenty of seatings. The selection is huge & quality is decent, staff are attentive & top class. The restaurant is very child friendly with Toddlers' Trolley & a variety of Toddlers' food
5
Lovely place, lovely interiors, scary toilet (kidding :P).
It's a highly recommended place. It very ably creates a mini Swirzerland atmosphere. Rosti with cream, cheese is wonderful.
5
Sadly we were too early to experience the underground dining concept, but the bakery breakfast upstairs was incredible. Buttery croissants, custom made omelettes, fresh squeezed juice and piping hot tea were the perfect start to the day for this bunch of tourists. Very reasonably priced.
5
One of my favorite lunch / dinner place. Excellent quality of food, very reasonably priced. Love the ambiance and the service provided. Do try their Crepe, Mushroom soup and Rosti - my personal favorite.
5
Fresh bread and coffee here is heaven. very tasty bread with butter will give you an energy all day. Enjoy eating with a very nice decoration in a Swiss style. saying Mooooooo with a cow.
5
The rosti is a must try. and the crepes are very good. All the food is made live and in some stalls tasters are offered. The basement is Swedish themed with a warm and cozy atmosphere. Great to take kids and family!
5
Basement turned into a magical place with an array of delicious food from around the world! Paella, Swiss Rosti, Crepes and many more. Highly recommended! Will definitely come back. Two thumbs up.
1
I've been to this place many timesI never had a good service claim hereBut the staff has always been kind and smiling, except for the rude guy who prepared for me rosti one Saturday night at 22:40 in December or January Me and my family went awa
5
This place is amazing!you would not think it when you enter the place on ground level, but underground, it is HUUUUUUUUUGE! I love the concept of shopping for what you want to eat and they serve absolutely everything. I was very impressed and it was very tasty! I am going back tomorrow
3
The concept is not new but adds to the fun in dining especially for groups. You go around the place and select dishes from the various stalls that prepare a variety of swiss/german/Italian selections and just hand the 'order electronic card' they give each person who enters. But the novelty quickly wears off as the dishes are just ok and not something you think about or talk about after. And be careful as the order sizes can actually be for sharing, at least for Asians. Also, check your bill! I was overcharged. One order punched twice and if you dont check you end up paying twice. Most likely a mistake but it will br a mistake you can end up paying.
4
 celebrating moms day with my friends.. long qeue to wait for the food nice food but a bit slow of service which was we understand because its a very busy lunch...delicious food, lack of staff to attend to clean the tables and chair we have to find seats first before we order our food.the pricy is abit pricy but when we got the bill the expecting price the amount of what we eat is not bad we thought it cost a lot. the place is abit hot not much of airconditioning. but over all its ok! were happy because we get full of the food
4
I called in here with a friend. Loads of choice and food that is mostly made freshly for you while you wait.
I ordered a pizza that I couldn't finish. Everything else looked excellent.
Well worth a visit.
4
Would highly recommend the dinning experience at Marche. It is a swedish restaurants with Live cooking. You can order a Pasta, Pizza, Salads fresh juices of you choice. And dont forget to try the Rosti. Food is just Yummy... my Kid loved it every bit.
4
Beautiful ambience and loved the food. Had savoury crepes and cream of mushroom. A wide variety of fusion food. Must go place.
4
We passed by Marche Bakery and ordered the banana pie, walnut brownie and coffee. The banana pie was a surprise to our taste buds. A must try. 👍👍👍👍👍
Didn't like the brownie though.
4
A nice change from the usual run of restaurants the way it has been presented. The seating is one level down and you're given a card to swipe at each live counter. Go to each counter to order and swipe card. While going out you pay for all that you have swiped for. There is a lot to choose from and there is a kids menu. The decor is rustic. Nice place to go and enjoy a good meal
2
Upon entering Marche 313, receptionists were busy talking to each other rather than first serving customers waiting to enter the restaurant for a meal.Crepe and Ice Cream station's chef can't be bothered to serve guests.Few of us were standing at the counter trying to catch the attention of the chefs, and they finally bother to serve us after > 5min.During payment, cashiers at the counters were so engrossed in their own conversation instead of focusing on clearing the queue of customers waiting to pay for the bills. The unpleasant experience was made worse when the cashier serving my bill was distracted by her chit-chat with the cashier beside her and made error to the billing. Had to wait another >5min to get the bills proper.Maybe 313 Marche is having too good business, and that they could afford to provide such treatment to paying customers. Not recommending and not returning even though the Rosti was very well made
5
Needed somewhere to get an early breakfast after an early arrival in Singapore. The self service section at the top if the stairs to the main restaurant opened at 8am, serving delicious pastries and various freshly made egg dishes. Not much seating and not very comfortable but the food was delicious and the staff were very friendly
5
This is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. There is a huge variety to choose from from. We opted for rosti, seafood paella, bread with mushroom soup and beef steak. Besides that the other options include roasted pork knuckles, roaster chicken, pizzas, various types of breads and many more. If in Singapore, try this joint. There may be a long queue as well
5
This is a great restaurant to eat lunch and is on below ground level. Great variety of Asian and European meals, desserts and beverages. Different types of diners were present, workers, tourists and locals. I always like to see locals dining out in a restaurant I am in, it says a lot about the quality of food. On entry you are given a swipe card, you use this when you order any beverage or meal. On leaving to finalise the account you produce the swipe card and pay. There are stairs and a lift and an escalator on leaving.Toilet was average and needed repair, yet did not spoil the visit
1
Ordered twice the roasted chicken option and I shud have learned my lesson the first time. Ordered whole chicken. There was so little meat and mostly bones. Not sure where they buy their skinny chickens from but surely they should know Singapore is known for good quality chicken. The cold storage roast chicken is a winner compared to Marche. Nandos chicken is a better winner. Singaporean chicken rice is better than Marche. I informed Marche international and the branch itself. But no reply. So I guess the public is warned. Roasted chicken is not worth the price.
4
Been to this restaurant for few times and must order are rosti and savoury crepes with pulled duck and pumpkin spread. Their dessert such as tiramisu is also very good.
4
I came to the bakery part of Marché.
To every single person in love with lemon and meringue tart, run there and try their raspberry & lemon tart.
It's just speechless!
The rest such as bread, sandwiches or danishes are good too.
4
We discovered this place by accident but what a find.
The food is fresh and wholesome with plenty of variety.
The emphasis is about European food but it really caters for all tastes
4
We ate a late lunch (3pm) on a weekday, quick easy and tasty. Many foods to choose from, something for everyone.
4
A great place to visit for good food within a European concept. You have a lot of choices: rosti, sausages, steaks, pork knuckle, pizzas, pasta, salads... Any would make for a very good choice, lunch or dinner.
4
The food is really nice and the ambience is good, despite it located at the basement. The interior design is nice and there are some set meals which include a drink. You get a card when you enter and the order will be keyed into the card when you order from different stations. You then have to pay with the card in the end
5
I have long enjoyed the Marche bakery, but this was my first visit to the restaurant below it. This venue is absolutely amazing â€“ friendly, cozy, and vibrant. Diners can make their own salads from super fresh ingredients or order seafood, pizza, crepes or other Swiss food from a variety of stalls and watch the food being prepared in front of them. We tried the smoked salmon over hash browns and the savoury crepe with poached salmon. The portions were so generous that we could have shared one dish! Prices are reasonable too. This is a great place to bring family and friends. They are sure to enjoy the delectable food and awesome ambience
5
One of the best places that we've been frequently going to be it for lunch or dinner. The simplest tastiest dish that I'll highly recommend will definitely going to be Rosto, served to you fresh out the frying pan with your desired toppings. Next up are the array of other choices around the whole place which has seafood, pizza and lots more other Swiss food you can think of. Great place for family, friends and love ones to dine when you're not sure where to go off to for awesome food. Prices are very affordable and the servings are plentiful so you could actually shared a dish and save up to go for another selection of your choice. The service staffs there are friendly and polite plus you could even select where you like to be seated at given if it's not packed. If you're around town head down there and you'll come to love the food and ambience.
5
Beautifully arranged kiosks after koisks.. fresh produce adorn kiosks making my dining experience somewhat different. In the restaurant- soup, salads, vegetable kiosks to slow cooked meat and even paella are found. In the bakery- cinammon chocolate croissant, turkey sandwiches etc are offered for the person on the go. Great food all in all
4
Looking at the small entrance at ground level, you would never imagine what's beneath. You go down the stairs and it's like a different world out there! Really unique place beneath-with plenty of seating arrangements, including a separate section for kids, so very much a place to get kids along. You are given a card, then you go to the various stations and order-they swipe it, you take your order and eat and then you can pay before leaving the place. I had rosti and mushroom ragout- both were good. My colleagues took crepes and pasta- which they liked too. All in all, an excellent dining experience, with plenty of choice for everyone with multiple stations
3
Come to this place for nice quick bite. Food is average as they are cooked by paid cook and less professional Chef.
5
I'm writing this review specifically for TOURIST. If your in orchard road & want to have good food in different concept ambiance then this place is perfect. Must haves are rosti, grilled salmon, waffles & creaps.
5
Good place for breakfast, lunch, dinner. It is all about fooood. You want to try everything but your stomach cannot ahahah.

We went today
We order 2 tomats moza pesto sandwichs
So good
Buttttt please madame the cashier, try to smile to say please to say thanks like us with you
We can't understand

We have visited Marche often. Being vegetarians, our main and staple food item ordered there is the rosti. For the first time, we were disappointed, all the plates of Rosti we ordered, the potatoes were on the raw side. Requested for a change and it was better but not that great even the 2nd time around. Guess when they are busy they take them off the burners early and so its raw. Plus unfortunately our veg pizza was a bit soggy, despite requesting for a crisp one, Just our luck, one of those day
4
We have been to Marche at least 20 times. I am very fond of it. I like the idea of being able to order the food at different stations. A large percentage of my visits, I ate the grilled salmon and medley of vegetables. Never had a bad experience. Some of my friends disagree with my review. They don't like the long queues of certain stations, nor do they like the amount of time it takes to receive your food. One friend said the food is just "okay". I think they're silly. Whether u like the food or not, what's undeniable is the ice cream being the best in Singapore. All the flavors too include the Pistacio, Creme brûlée, Vanilla Bean, etc., are fantastic and way better than their competitors at both ends of the mall. I highly recommend Marche.
1
Have eaten @ Marché Somerset before and found the food to be reasonable in both quality and price. I did read many TA comments about the poor service but hadn't given much thought to it until this morning. I tried to order the signature "Swiss Breakfast" only to have the staff ignore me completely or wave me off when I tried to put in an order. When I finally did get eye contact with the cook he just shouted repeatedly "15 minutes". I'm not sure what bothered me most, the poor organisation or the bad manners. Once you open your doors to customers you should be ready to serve your most popular dish, not start preparing it once the restaurant was filling up, especially knowing that rösti, the key ingredient, takes a good 15-20 minutes to cook properly. On final thing that I found surprising was that the cook who shouted "15 minutes" was cooking bacon in a deep fat fryer. I would be interested to know if it is a common way for restaurants to cook bacon, or if it was just another reflection of how poorly prepared they were for paying customers to walk through the door. Either way, it doesn't matter because I went elsewhere for my breakfast.
4
Didn't dine in the restaurant, just had a brunch, I tried 3 different muffins,the walnut & banana is very tasty, the best one I ever had in Singapore, I also had the turkey sandwich, awesome one, the staff also recommended the beef sandwich, maybe will give a try next time
2
I ordered the Rosti with veal sausage, the staff charged my card but forgot to prepare the food. 10 minutes later I asked and they smiled and said "5 minutes", meanwhile the other staff member realized they never put the sausage on the grill and started to cook it. I was eventually served an undercooked Rosti and undercooked sausage 25 minutes after my original order. On its own, not a big deal, but everything else I ordered was then cold and it turned out to be a terrible meal
5
Had dinner with friends at this wonderful restaurant. It's wooden architecture with many stations for food like pasta, juices, meat and seafood, salad, soup etc. You get a plastic card where all the food at different stations are billed into and in the way out you pay once. The was so much of variety I couldn't decide on what to have! Finally I had sausages, salmon filet, seafood pasta and a fresh orange juice. All the food is made fresh and everything was perfect! The ambience was very comfortable and the service was excellent. If you are into freshly made great food this is a must try place.
5
Didn't dine in but stopped kerbside between meetings and I bought myself a great mixed salami and pickled cheese baguette and a long crushed iced tea - all for less than 8 bucks. Was surprised that it was a decent size and generously filled with fresh ingredients. Must say they're smart in putting this small deli just outside the train stop. Friendly staff, great job guys
2
We visited the place on 23rd December and had a decent experience although half of the food on offer at the various counters were not available. We didn't expect to come back as it was an average experience and expensive too but as we were shopping in the same mall we decided to dine here again and give this place another try on 28th December 2016. As we entered we were given the customary cards to which are charged your food and beverage items that you order. As we approached the pasta and pizza counter, we were told chicken wasn't available. So no chicken pizza, no chicken pasta and no chicken dish. what made it even more horrible was the rude behavior of one of the counter staff. There was this cook from Bangladesh who was courteous but the other staff were rudely telling all the customers that their food orders will take half an hour or above.The manner in which they were told was shocking because it gave an impression that the cooks were doing a favour by cooking. I have never come across such appalling rude behavior.When i went to collect my veg pasta, there was a lady customer who told one of the cooks that her pizza was burnt and it did look burnt, but the cook insisted and forced the lady to take her pizza or wait another half an hour. Not expected of such a brand. shocking. The brand and the management need to train the staff on customer approach and start on basics of how to talk to customers. Even the counter where beer was served was out of drinks. The only counter that had food remaining was the Roesti counter.We did speak to the Manager who was a lady, courteous and polite. She was the saving grace and listened carefully and heard our grievances.All in all a very disappointing experience.I will definitely not recommend this restaurant to anyone
4
We like to dine at Marche for it's huge variety of food and good tasting dishes. Normally go for the salads , grilled meats and seafood. We also like crepes with strawberry and ice cream. The Swiss decor provides a great ambience for family and group meals. Conveniently located at Somerset 313 mall, we usually like to go there when we like to have lots of western food choices at a single location
2
It is the Switzerland branch which also very expensive in Switzerland.Good things is they have children's play area but in Singapore, it is very small. Not like real Swiss ones....Foods are full of daily products as you expected and expensive.Sadly, it is not really tasty as compare to real Swiss one either.I wish they can bring true goodness of Swiss so Singapore can enjoy it
4
It has a theme of a Swiss local market wherein you can roam around the place, and select the food that you like to eat (on ala cart charges) from soup, main course, dessert, and drinks. Food are really fresh, you get to see the ingredients, the preparations, and people are very knowledgeable in their area of assignment. I ordered salami sandwich, cheesecake, and their refreshing orange juice. As expected in Singapore, food is quite expensive. But not only here, everywhere
2
We have frequented this chain in many locations around the world. We were disappointed with the extremely high prices at this location.Restaurant was very dirty and many of the chefs didn't use proper hygiene when preparing the food. Luckily there are many better food choices in the Somerset area
4
I came here with my daughter in law and my four year old granddaughter for an early lunch on Friday.We sat in the children's area which has a small play pen and toys.The concept is good, most of the food is prepared in front of you at the various stations, it was both fresh and delicious.We all ate well for 70 dollars
4
One of my favorite food spots - the Rosti and Pork Knuckle hit the spot and the culmination is the pancake with strawberries, chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream. Besides plenty of pasta, cheese, fruits, juices, breads, seafood on offer. A great place to go in a group and share as quantities are good and variety is hug
4
After a year of Indonesian food (fried everything), this restaurant was my first culinary stop after leaving Indonesia. I'm very happy that it was. I had a pizza because I wanted some properly done western food, and I was satisfied with my selection. Their pizza is thin crust, which I liked. There were different food stations, like meat, salads and seafood to choose from. I also had the basil lemonade, which was absolutely delicious. They had ice cream selections and lots of pastries (including a chocolate fountain) for dessert. If I was staying in Singapore, I would definitely return to this restaurant
5
I was looking for restaurant around me on Orchard Road for a late lunch and Marche popped up.The restaurant from the outside looked like a dessert place however I saw an arrow pointing down saying restaurant. I followed the stairs down and was amazed with what I saw. The hostess greeted me and asked if I had been there before. She briefed me on what I had to do and she gave me a swipe card.The whole place is designed like a market where you have to hop around and see what you want and order. I went to the savoury crepe counter and ordered one with a filling of roast chicken. I also ordered an apple,carrot and celery juice. The juice was freshly squeezed and healthy. The crepe with roast chicken was big portion. It was tasty and delicious .Post this I walked a little more and discovered a roesti counter. But, I had no space for anymore food at all. The next counter was a dessert display and it was one of the best I had seen in long time. I was being greedy and ended up ordering crepe with mascarpone and strawberry. The dessert was delicious and as expected I wasn't able to finish it.Overall an excellent place to spend hours on an empty stomach so that you can sample a lot of food
5
Marche's sweet Swiss village vibe makes you forget your worries
Perfect roesti
The caesar salad counter is perfection as they freshly toss salads to your liking
Fluffy waffles with whipped cream and berries
And the best chocolate mousse. I've ever had
Highly recommend
4
We have old and young dining together with us. Wide variety of food to choose from. Very family friendly. Clean place and cutleries. My kids loves this place.
4
The roast chicken crepe was good. So was the Apple pie and tiramisu which I shared with my lunch companion . They go well with the coffee

This is an odd but popular place for a relatively cheap meal with a wide variety of choices. It is down in a basement space off the covered walk in the central part of Orchard Road. Once there, you have around a dozen separate kitchens, bars or bakeries to choose from, and what you order is tallied up so that you pay all of it at the exit. There are seating areas, although they were popular on the evening we were there so best to claim one as soon as you arrive. The food is an eclectic mix of Italian, Swiss, Spanish, German and a few others mixed in. It is good basic Western European fare, but that said much of it contains many more calories that a typical Asian diet. The beers are mainly German or Asian. Inevitably, due to its popularity, queues form and so putting together a meal from several sources can become time-consuming and a little frustrating, especially if you have kids with you

Marche Is a very popular place and i love it so much, The food very fresh and taste good. Rostti, Caesar Salad mix with Bacon, Mushroom Soup, homemade Savoury Crepe with Chicken mushroom,Fresh Oyster, dessert..etc.Always freshly prepared lunch express menu from $8.90+ onwards, we love it so much
4
We keep coming back here for the food. Food is great! Food is nice! No question on about it! Great place to bring friends and relatives who are visiting SG. We love the caesar salad and their Paella! Pork knuckle and their pizza is great too!But when it comes to customer experience, don't expect a lot from them. Staff don't smile anymore and don't show their sincerity when they ask what you're ordering. There's no customer service at all. People come back for the food. Just for the food. Place is a bit tired. There's mosquito in some places. Experienced it several times and not just once. 4stars for the food2stars for ambience0star for customer servic

Well located, Large choice of quality food well priced.The large choice of food makes it a great place to go with friends and family The Roschties are really good ( would be nice with Raclette) my friends had the Pizza, Fried Calamaris, crepes..they enjoyed.The beverage choice is good just the wine choice could be a little improved Only one improvement could on on the table cleaning as it takes time to find someone to take the used dishes between main and desert.

We passed MarchÃ© as we walked along 331 Orchard road, it looked like a good place for a filling sandwich.The service was quick, the sandwiches were well priced and the sandwiches were extremely filling and tasty. There was some seating to rest your weary feet, all up a very good experience
5
Came down the stairs and was surprised by the festive atmosphere of the restaurant. Hearty, fresh and good tasting food. Fast and excellent service, especially at the cashier who went her way out to take out an item from the bill that we were not aware that was part of a meal. Will certainly come back
4
We had lunch here and all the food/beverages were cooked and prepared right before your eyes. This is a one-stop place where you can find variety of choices of food (Swiss/European). Just choose, point and they will just swipe your card. Payment is before you exit so there's the surprise! Some were I think overly-priced but some were ok
5
Great afternoon tea after a long walk in this busy city on Saturday afternoon. Coffee and cake were yummy. Hot chocolate was very nice. Other dishes looked good too but we didn't try. Next time :)
4
Lots of choice in Swiss style restaurant. Always busy.
Play area for kids.
Watch the locals to see how to get best value by picking right size plates and sharing.
Good place for fresh salads.
3
Only came here to buy breakfast. Pastries was quite good. Fresh orange juice. Good coffee. Breakfast package was very nice at good price. Definitely better alternative than other fast food. But the girl serving at the counter was not too friendly; unhappy to answer questions.
4
A wonderful array of wholesome healthy freshly-cooked food. It's great for big or small groups. Try to avoid peak times and the queues will be shorter and more bearable.

Full points to Marche for the rustic look; my girl felt as if it was a different world altogether.In terms of food, their food has always been good though not really outstanding but when going out with my bubbly, if I can get a good cup of coffee while she eats well and enjoys herself, food really isnt my priority.Marche serves heathly food options for kids too; I specially like their crepes and juices. Yes, their juices are really nice and fresh.To the uninitiated, marche has play area for kids and what else can a working mum ask for on a weekly dinner date with my baby.All in all, its a lovely place for families and even friends with kids

This lovely swiss-decorated restaurant lures me and my friend with the model of 2big cows with swiss bells on their necks. The products soldvthere are stuffed sandwiches with veggies and beef , pork, cheese. It's not real fadstfood. There is also desserts including varieties of cakes, milk, other drinks. It's quick and satisfactory for price and quality we got.

Went with the family during our visit to Singapore. It's quite a large restaurant but very busy. We were lucky we found a table. No one shows you to a table.. you need to walk around and find one your self! The restaurant is self service and has several food stations that is European cuisine. The grilled salmon was really good and was accompanied by a nice fresh salad that perfectly complimented the fish. The ravioli was not that great. Very hard pasta with a bland tomatoe based sauce. The chicken pizza could use some flavour as it was very bland. There was absolutely no pleasure eating the pizza. Would not waste time visiting this establishment.
4
lunch set is quite good with 1 main dish, a small bowl of veggies and a drink for 8.90 sgd.the atmosphere is marketplace with stalls of foods.my first time here... staff do not take the time to explain properly the concept which different than conventional restaurants.you got a card where your orders are recorded then you pay upon leaving.a nice experience for lunch. food is high quality
1
The line up for a Swiss Rosti was way too long. Waiting time over 20 mins to get served then another 8 to 10 mins for the food to be prepared. Just a waste of time. If your rosti is so popular put more people on this station. I won't be back

I came here for lunch for two days in a row from Saturday, 27 August to Sunday, 28 August. In my first visit, I came with my infant son and, if my memory serves me right, we ordered tomato basil soup, sausage platter, Swiss pear waehe and cafe latte. The pork knuckle looked mouth-watering, but I decided on sausage platter as I thought it would be easier for my infant son to enjoy. It was a mistake as he barely touched the sausages and only had a little mashed potato, tomato basil soup and the Swiss pear waehe. I was left to finish almost all of the food plus one glass (yup, glass, not cup, if my memory serves me right) of cafe latte. It was an enjoyable experience. Once my son fell asleep, I ordered another glass of cafe latte and sat there for a while. The cafe latte was good and it was cheaper than that of Starbucks. I really like the interior design of this restaurant, mimicking European countryside with all raw materials on display. There was a playground for kids too and free balloons were available near the cashiers. The staffs were generally helpful. While enjoying my coffee, I noticed one pretty female waitress (her name is Sheryl if I remember correctly) helping to return a bag left behind by a group of Indian guests. Upon settling the payment, I had one free green-and-white candy served in a jar behind the cashiers. Overall, my first visit was a fabulous experience.Still thinking about the pork knuckle, I drop by this restaurant for the second time on the next day. This time, I came with my wife and son. We ordered pork knuckle of course, sausage with mashed potato, chicken soup with bread, cheese cake, strawberry cake (I completely forget the exact name) and cafe latte. To my surprise, my son did actually love the pork knuckle. The chicken soup was good and the bread was awesome. My wife commented that the cheese case was very delicious. The strawberry cake was delicious, but I was not too fond of the texture. I still preferred the Swiss pear waehe that I ordered on the previous day as it had a texture slightly similar to creme brulee. Unfortunately, on the downside, the service seemed to be slightly inconsistent, probably because there were too many guests. Some utensils were not available and the green-and-white candy jar behind the cashier was not there. Upon settling the payment, we went upstairs to the bakery to buy the bread that we had earlier with our chicken soup. Overall, I still had an enjoyable experience here. I plan to pay another visit on this coming weekend for another round of pork knuckle. The price here was definitely not cheap, but I think the quality of the food and the environment somehow live up to my expectation

Very fun for kids. Recommend this to everyone. Has great choices and a very nice setting. Lovely service. Would go again and I am going again soon.
5
Oh i love this place, the food everywhere makes me want to try them all. Just add more meat selection and it will be perfect <3. Even the pastries are amazing!! I will come back!
5
I was gathered with my few friends in marche yesterday . The food was fast and tasty, one of my friends 3 years old Daughter also totally enjoyed the playground there. Highly recommend. Nice place to go .
4
Attentive staff. Good quality food. Not too crowded or claustrophobic. U kno wat ur getting. Best part is u don't walk out smelling like food
3
We spent lots of time and memory in the old one, and when we knew about the one in the "underground" of 313, we had to pay a visit.And we still miss the old one at Heeren......No loud greeting from afar. Smiles on the face of staff were rare....the caucasian staff even smirk at us when we walked away from a food counter after standing there to decide if we were to have that for dinner.Food was decent. Nothing to complain about that's for sure. It's the Marche way of cooking and serving. Won't go too wrong with that for dinner.But we did see some old skiing equipment as wall decor, rusted and dirty. Supposedly to give the rustic appeal, but just round the corner we spotted the kids play area. Pretty unwise. If any itchy and curious little hands are going to scratch on them, could bring a whole new set of problem to both parties.Overall, food is decent. Service standard still need to be improved. Won't return for sure. Too many other food options in the area to consider
4
Nice place to go with family (incl., kids) at all times of the day. The rösti with chicken sausage is a must; as is the crepe with chicken mushroom... A nice system of using cards to purchase from the market place that is a novelty for kids... :

I was in SG for 2 weeks and had my daily coffee at a coffee shop right in front of Marche is Somerset 313. Initially I thought it was just a bakery selling (good) bread and when a friend of mine invited me to dine there, I was surprised to know that the basement is a maze of culinary delights. Think fast-food on a higher level. There was roesti - potato pancakes topped/filled with your choice of meat, dairy and vegetable. There was a long line there we we moved around and saw salmon crepes. They were huge and served with a small side salad. There was a soup station next to where they bake bread, a salad bar, paella, fruit infused iced tea served in carafes, pasta and a host of other wonderfully prepared fare. Their service was efficient and they make sure that they are consistent to the set up of the place.The the ambience, the experience and of course the food come with a cost. It's not the most wallet-friendly choice however, it is all worth it. We spent about $60 for 2 - big money of many but we did not mind. We do not do this everyday, we enjoyed our meal, was awed by the experience and knew it was worth it
4
Fast food has its purpose and sometimes one will endure it to quickly energize, never mind its potential downside. But this one comes as a surprise. The setup is similar but it attempts to create a European ambiance with its wood and stone theme. That's just the surface. What you see, and smell, are freshly made goodies that make you forget shopping for a while. This is at a level below ground at 313 Somerset Singapore where some serious shopping can be had. Fresh salads, natural fruit juices and warm healthy soup concoctions are there for starters. Chicken, duck, pork, beef are roasted and fried. Bread and mashes potatoes instead of rice. Cakes pastries and ice cream to top off the meal. In between are pizza and other choices. Great food and ambiance. Perfect to recharhe you for more shopping.
4
Unique dining experience whereby you enter and they give you a card. (PLEASE DO NOT LOSE THE CARD! YOU HAVE TO PAY $200 if you lose it).You go around the different food sections getting your food and they will charge to your card. Their rosti with sausages is magnificent and usually there's a really long queue. BUT WORTH THE QUEUE!Then when you are done, you exit with the card and they will charge u from the card!Tadah

We saw these restaurants around when we last visited Singapore and to eat here was on our bucket list this time. It is an awesome experience just walking around the different stations watching the food preparation, cooking and serving. Swiss food is something different to anything else. The extensive use of fresh ingredients and the array of vegetables was incredible and tantalising - especially if, like us, we had Asian fare for the last few days and our bodies just craved for basic food, well cooked. I chose Rosti - I'd always wanted to taste it, and the chef recommended mushroom ragout to go with it. It was rich, tasty and creamy. I should have ordered a small side salad to go with it, but that was my error. Hubby had roasted chicken wings and a beef noodle broth which he said was also very tasty. The décor, cleanliness and extreme thought that went into setting this up was nothing short of amazing and is thoroughly recommended to everyone. Being licensed was a bonus
3
I was there for a lunch. The feta focaccia was really good. The apple tart smelled too much like egg.
Service is good and prices are affordable.
5
We went there for dinner and the food and ambience is just perfect...since we are vegetarian we had very good variety of food...the veg crepes and roasties..almost everything...must go if you are in Singapore
4
Swiss restaurant in Singapore, interesting place, good food. Had a pork knuckle and weissbier, wife had a crepe, kids had pizza. You are given a card that is swiped for everything you order then pay at the end.
5
you roam around with a card any take whatever food u choose. you have a lot of to select from [fish, meat, veg, fresh juice, cake/ ice cream etc]. prior check out you pay what is in the card. the ambiance is fantastic.
4
Amazing dining experience, with a great ambiance. Some counter are a bit over priced.
Quality food. The entrance to this restaurant is not very prominent. A visit to this place is a must.
4
Went there for lunch on a Wednesday. Thin crowd so plenty of seats. Entrance is at level 1 and dining area one floor below. It has a lift located inside the restaurant for its patrons only. Plenty of food choices. Tried the Wednesday special - Oxtail Soup (tomato based) - which comes with a large piece of rye bread. Soup has chunks of carrots and potatoes and generous portion of oxtail (abt 3 pieces measuring 3.5 inch). A hearty meal for about $9.90 excluding GST. I asked for walnut bread in place of rye bread at no additional cost. Marche serves one of the best oxtail soups in town at a very good price. Can't get this price anywhere else in Singapore with such a generous portion of oxtail in an air-conditioned place. Those who loves oxtail soup must give a try here

We tried to book a section off for a child's birthday party on a Saturday. We were coming from Switzerland so I thought it would be funny to have our child's birthday party at Marché with our local friends, Swiss flag and all. The manager in charge wrote us an email saying that she didn't take reservations for a group for a Saturday. So our friends arrived early and we got ourselves a section. ONLY to find out that there was some other family's kids' party at the kids playground area, with a written announcement on a board, that it was reserved for their child's birthday party. So basically, the manager told us WE couldn't book tables for our group of child's birthday party but another family was able to. I still have the email from the manager AND the picture of the announcement with matching dates of the event. Disappointing service from the manager. However, staff was great. Food was decent and the payment system works well.
4
Nice place to have lunch/dinner when you are in the Orchard road area. Plenty of options: rosti, pizza, pasta, crepes, grilled meat, paella etc.Average price per person: 15-25SGD.The restaurant is at the B1 level and is a nice break from the busy crowd upstairs
4
To get out of the rain we ate here for its convenient location between malls on Orchard Road. My mum & I had the tomato, mozzarella sandwich & the roasted veggies sandwich and the strawberry cake which was all very tasty and the bread was so fresh
5
There are many types of foold that you can choosr (from asien to european good) you get a card and you get yr food and pay with the marché card. The restaraunt is well decorated and there is really much food to choose from (as said)Recommended for family too...
4
Loved the Ambiance more than the food. Food was "Okay". But i felt that the food is bit over priced here. Minimum 30$ per person is required here. Very little options was veg cuisine. Its a paradise for Non vegetarians.
4
Crepe and ramps r good u hv to keep ur card and gv it at the counter u want to order.while leaving cards of all guests collected and billed.different ambiance at Singapore
5
U can pick n choose the kind u food u want from a huge variety . U can opt for american , korean , european or pure continental for your meals. There are several counters preparing ready to eat hot meals. We opted for the swiss rosti , roast garlic sausage and vegetable pasta. Each counter is separate with a queue. The roast garlic sausage is a favourite dish of the swiss food counter and is served with potato mash and sour cream. After the meals we were offered a 10% discount coupon for the next visit. Average cost for us worked out to SGD 18 w/o drinks at lunch
3
Check them out during lunch hours especially because the meal offered comes with a cup of drink which is super worth it. One will always be able to find out which food is the most popular as the queue for it is always so long. The seats are based on first come first serve but the good thing is that you can show people that the table is reserved with what is provided by Marche
4
Marche is a part of the Movenpick group and it has a unique set menu called the lunch express on weekdays which is a real value for money proposition. The restaurant offers a kids meal and we just have to swipe our card at the different live cooking stations. The kids usually get some small gift with their meal, which is a big draw for them. There is a kids play area to keep them entertained and the restaurant runs food festivals based on themes. We enjoy binging on the crepes, the pizzas and the rostis. The fruit juices are awesome as they are freshly prepared.There are quite a few dessert options too. It's a self service place and we can request them to box leftovers.The loos are clean and well maintained, even when there is heavy footfall.The ambience is unique as it recreates different Swiss themes. Definitely worth a visit
5
Great Place . . Great Variety of Food . . . They give you cards which you are suppose to keep and use while ordering anything and the on the way out pay. Each person gets one individual card. Tried 2-3 dishes and was not disappointed. Best meal i had in Singapore. A must try
4
Went there for dinner with the family as a member wanted the rosti...which is a must try...large place with ample seating but If you're not early be prepared to stand in line. A great choice of meats from veal to lamb and steaks...a good system where you order / eat and then pay after they put everything on the card they give you.. Then you pay when leaving...choice of paella, pasta pizza fish and vegetarians.. if in Singapore definitely worth the visit though the price is fairly steep.
5
Marche! The first time I had been here way back in 2000.. And ever since I love this place.The interiors are like Swiss country side. Loads of wood used and you see Switzerland flag. It's a huge place with seperate food stations so basically you choose what you want to eat and swipe a card and pay later. Being a vegetarian I had Rosti and I was amazing. The other day while flying Singapore airlines I was talking to a air hostess about Marche and she said Rosti is a must have there!! I said yes I had it! It delighted me that even locals recommend it for the Rosti! The pizzas are also nice. If you eat non veg food choice of food is large.. The juice counter has a wide range of juices to select from. Overall a must visit place though slightly expensive. Don't forget the have the Rosti friends.
4
Such a joy to eat at Marche. With its Swiss market-inspired ambience, it's an awesome place to dine and hang out. The manner of presenting the different food and beverage counters is just so inviting. You actually end up wanting to try all the food - from the steaks, sausages, potato meals, pasta, pizza, veggies, soups - even the crepes and pies. The various drinks - soda, juice, tea, others - are arranged on ice, atop big wooden barrels. There are hot drinks, too. When you enter, an account card is given to each individual to record purchases in all the counters. Payment is done upon checkout. This method is convenient and hygienic, as no money is held while guests dine. Some of the things I truly enjoyed:1) artisan-style pizza and pasta, oven-baked from fresh ingredients and according to the wishes of the diner 2) hot bowl of cream of mushroom soup, paired with garlic bread3) fresh veggies for a crisp garden salad 4) crepes made in front of you 5) lastly, the homey ambience (such as semi-finished wooden tables etc) that makes guests instantly at easeI heard that Marche can get quite crowded on certain days so it might be best to plan in advance by seeking reservations.
4
It's always a pleasure having lunch or dinner at Marche. Everything looks so fresh and the food is great.Even there are 3 or 4 Marche restaurants in SG, the one at 313@Somerset is the best.Their pasta/italian kitchen needs improvements as they never managed to do some good pasta, for the pasta section I recommend the Marche at Suntec City.I find the beers and wine selection very expensive for a casual restaurant but overall the experience is very good
3
A great place to hang out.. great ambience..
We did try quite a few things.. the grilled fish was perfect! The crepe wasn't..
Good choices and variety of food. A bit overpriced!
Worth a visit!
5
I had the Roestli, that's roasted potatoes Swiss style and the roast beef and a cold beer, tried some of the salad bar stuff and the cheese they had on display very good value
3
I come to Marche @ 313 Somerset pretty much every week to buy some croissants. Usually early in the morning. Generally the croissants are of good value, however they could be better if heated to provide additional softness.
5
We have dinner here. When we come, the long queue of visitors are waiting outside but all of them are patient
The foods are good, delicious and nice looking. The staffs are friendly and helpful.
3
We got a ribeye steak and salmon steak on separate occasions, at a discounted price. There was nothing special about those to justify the prices, so try to avoid them. However, you do get to see the chef cut your slice of steak from a larger chunk - from what I understand, Marche prides itself on the freshness of its food. If this appeals to you, then you would like this place. We also got ourselves a slice of cake, which was delicious and worth its price. The interior for this particular branch (located underground) at 313 Somerset is much cosier and more charming than the other branches at, say, VivoCity or JEM
5
This restaurant has a lot of food options varying from seafood to pizza to waffles to fondue to almost everything. Very delicious food and very friendly staff. All food items are charged on a card given to us by them, which we pay for before we leave the restaurant. I will definitely visit again
5
Always enjoyed their rosti! Add an egg if you like. It is filling and extremely tasty if the staff pan fry it a little longer. Cost about $7.90. Tried their ravioli for the first time. There were only about 7 pcs so it is considered quite a small dish. My personal favourites here, besides the rosti, would be the salmon, mango cum banana fruit crepe, mushroom soup and the lime juice! Yums! Their restroom has an interesting concept.
4
I live in Singapore and love the local food. But sometimes I just really want porkchops and mashed potatoes, or a steak or whatever, cooked from quality ingredients in a Western style. And Marche does this really, really well. If you've been travelling a while, or if you've got kids who aren't adjusting well to the local fare, Marche might be a good choice
5
I was back after a gap of 6 years to Singapore and had to visit this place as its a favourite. I love the concept of the market place and where you see most items being prepared/cooked in front of you. I loved the mushroom soup and the garlic bread. The ambience of this restaurant is casual and elegant
4
We stayed at the Orchard Grand Court Hotel on Killiney Road and had 3 or 4 good breakfast joints in the vicinity. The only problem was the cost. By fluke we wandered into the Somerset building and noticed the Marche.We were surprised to find that you could get, rye bread, scrambled eggs, mushrooms,onions with a coffee for S$5.50. That was the cheapest and best American breakfast we found. The other benefit was to get egg whites only at no extra cost.The restaurants on Killiney Rd, albeit good, were a little pricey since we had to get breakfast out every day
4
for a basement space i think they did a good job. food selection is good. the way they presented the drinks were nice. staff were courteous. will definitely come back with friends. love the meat and the veggies.
4
Stopped by coincidentally while walking through this mall.
Good find it was. Had all kinds of food and drinks, however predominantly western/European. Ambiance was relaxing and comfortable, away from the hustle-and-bustle of Orchard Rd.
4
I had the Rosti which was fantastic and was served quickly. The Breakfast meal is great value with Bacon, Sausages and an Egg as well as a drink included for less that 10 dollars, a great meal.
4
They an asparagus festival going on when we were there and everything was yummy - the savory crepes, the asparagus with hollandaise sauce, the regular roesti, etc. Good quick meal - but very heavy so prepare to sleep after and not go out in the su
5
The concept of Marche Restaurant tries to recreate a Swiss village market. As we entered, we were given a card each. As we took our round around the restaurant, we were impressed by the variety on display. Fresh vegetables in one counter, fish & seafood (salmon fillets, Calamari and barramundi) in another. The longest queues were in the Pizza and Rosti counters, but the meat corner was equally impressive with its variety. We tried quite a variety of food here and all were excellent…our favourite happened to be the Rosti topped by salmon The card we were given at the entrance is meant to be taken to the food counter of our choice, swiped there and at the billing counter, all what has been swiped are added up for payment.It was a wonderful food experience there, and when next in Singapore, would not hesitate to revisit Marché Mövenpick
4
European, Swiss and western food to choose from displayed in the many different stalls available. Order your food and collect them when they are ready. Should try the mushroom dish and the fresh salads. I also like the crispy Parma Ham Pizza fresh from the oven. Nice ambience
5
I've eaten here a few times over the past few years and again this month. This restaurant has always amazed me with its variety. There's something for everyone...served from kiosks that specialise in a few dishes.I love the roast beef though this time had the ham and cheese crepe which was superb. I was with my wife and we shared another dish of sausages as well...but my vote goes to the crepes.
5
Would go again for dinner , steak was cook to perfect doness. Ambience is as the name mention marche (market). Though a little noisy but overall this place is a must to drop by once in awhile for a nice gathering.I feel that drinks is a little expensive, many food selection for you to choose
5
Food court with self service like in Alps. Separate stations for seafood, salads, pasta, meat/steaks, rosti pancakes, etc. Fresh juices, wine, Prosecco - whatever you wish you can find it there. Try grilled Lobster and of course rosti with salmon! Can be quite busy in the evenings..
5
If are you missing good home made food from Europe than its place for you, many varieties of food, meat, veggies, pizzas, pastas, always will find something for yourself. whats more they have promotion in week days like 50% off or 2 in 1. you can easily bring your whole family and friends
4
There are several types of food and beverage to choose from. Pick and choose your food/drink and lots of comfy tables and chairs to sit and enjoy the food and chat with your friends for hours (with no hassle from staff)
4
This is a good for casual dining...overall the food was good...however the place can be noisy during the weekends. There is always a long queue during the weekends so one has to be early to avoid the queues.
4
We love stopping by as a family for great food in this charming underground food heaven. It's deceivingly spread out with more food options than you could imagine, something for everyone regardless of taste or food preference
4
It's the best Swiss food you'll manage to get in Singapore at really affordable prices. The rosti is really nice and the chocolate fondue is amazing for dessert. Love the ambiance and the payment system also!
5
Marche's is a brilliant concept and I loved dining here after a busy day of shopping.The place has a very cosy vibe.So the thing here is, you get a voucher card when you enter. Every counter that you go wether Italian or Indian ( they have tons of cuisine and a lot of other stuff to check out,practically everything that you can think of) you swipe the card,take your food and select a table to dine at.My favorites were the Italian counter and the one where they made some excellent Rosti.When you are about to exit,they check the amount you have dines for and you pay for that. They say the outlet near Vivo city shopping centre is much bigger and better but if you are on Orchard this too should do the job
5
I always recommend friends who travelled to Singapore to dine here. Particularly at the Somerset, Orchard road location. The ambience, maybe due to the lighting and display, make you feel that you're dining in a tavern in some part of Europe. Meat, veggies and fruit are always fresh. The resto is found under the bakery display where you will be given a card for which you will use to purchase food and drinks. Payment at the exit where the card will be swiped. Always a place we go back to whenever we are in Singapore
5
This Restaurant has a good Rosty, you can choose the additional topping for the Rosty.The mushroom crepes with ham is good also.I really love the ambience, because they put fresh vegetables, like tomatoes, carrots, etc arround the food kiosk, that makes me feels something
5
Their rosti as can be seen from the reviews is really a must try. It is excellent. But what was even better than the rosti was their chocolate crepes. The swiss chocolate in them was sooooo good, I can almost close my eyes and taste it till now. Must try
4
We love Rosti and the one at this place is good enuff to enjoy once in a while. We are vegetarians, so cannot order the sides, which were both non-veg. Plain Rosti is served with sour cream and is good! The place can get crowded on the weekends, best book a table in advance. they give each person a card on entry, even a child and you can go eat whatever you wish from any counter and they keep adding it to your tab and you just pay in the end. Convenient and eas

We always come back to Marche and it is one of the highlights of our visits to Singapore, however we did have 1-2 complaints this time. Firstly, we attended for the breakfast 'set' as they call it. We are vegetarians so asked for one 'set' sans bacon or sausage and requested mushrooms in lieu. As it turned out that meant that we couldn't have the 'set' so not only did we pay an extra $10 for mushrooms even though we didn't have any of the meat, we were also told we couldnt have the Orange juice or coffee that came with the 'set'. So we paid double the price of the 'set' because we were vegetarians. Secondly, that same evening we waited 30 minutes for a waffle to be cooked and that was after the elder lady who served us making the mistake of cooking a crepe instead of a waffle which we had to pay for. So, whilst we will still recommend that all our friends visit Marche, it was disappointing this time as we have returned faithfully every time we travel to Singapore from Perth and ear most of our meals there. Perhaps a little more thought needs to be put into breakfast options and the team behind the dessert counter need to get their act together. We do hope our next visit is a better one

Love the marketplace concept, with a wide spread available for the taking. Salads, crepes, fresh made pasta, lemonades, rosti and more. Good value for money.
5
Marche is the best place to head to for lunch or dinner fir the sheer choice you get and great food freshly made. Love the rosti which is our definite favourite and yes, grilled fish. Excellent desserts too......try apple pie.
4
Good variety,
Good prices,
Friendly staff,
Tasty foods,
You can take away or eat there. Very nice place and a good concept overall.
4
Being a vegetarian, would declare that the crepes are the best I've ever eaten. Would also recommend the desserts on display as well as the freshly made fruit & vegetable juices.
4
Invited to Marche by my son, I found that there was wide variety to choose from. We decided on the rosti which was the most popular, mushroom soup, pork sausages & some bread to go with it as well as a baked pasta. Found the food to be delicious but the price can a little bit on the higher side.Just beware of one thing. You are given a card for each person to swipe what you order. Make sure you do not lose the card as you may have to pay for loss card.Worth going there if you have not tried it before
4
I'm somewhat of a regular here. At least a few times a year when in the area I'll stop here for lunch. It can often get busy but getting something to go is easy and the price is right and there are many places to sit and relax outside to enjoy it

I have fond memories of Marche when it was in the Heeren building. That closed down a few years ago, and Marche, in its new avatar,reopened in 313 Somerset, with branches in Vivo City, Suntec City and jem malls.The choice is limited, service is indifferent and the prices are way too high for a casual dining experience. Rosti, the signature dish is reasonably priced at $7.90, but if you order the Mushroom Ragout to go with the rosti it's $10.90 extra. The prices displayed are ambiguous, leading one to think that $10.90 covers both the basic rosti and the mushroom sauce. The truth hits you only when you check out.The staff at the crepes counter were chatting away and almost reluctantly sidled up to the counter to take my order of crepes with pistachio ice-cream. The ice-cream was very good, the crepes were mediocre
2
Looking for an alternative to Singaporean cuisine, reviewing TA reviews went looking for restaurant called Medz, however, after a lot of searching found that it had closed down.So, went looking for 2nd choice, Marche.From time spent in Switzerland - love Rosti - unhealthy? Yes, but nice.Marche is really a food court, where you are given a swipe card upon entry that you use to purchase various foods and pay from amount on card at checkout.Rosti, nice but undercooked, with nice pork sausage, side of vegetables and a couple of glasses of Reisling.Food and ambience ok for a food court.Then came the "kick in the tail" 2 Swiss rosti (shredded potato cake). $15.902 pork sausages $13.902 small plates of mixed (cold) vegetables $21.802 glasses of Riesling @ $17.90 each = $35.80So - you really only know the $$$ of the meal until you hit the checkout!SGD 93.30 (incl.taxes and gst) for a very, very ordinary and half cooked, cold meal that would cost you at least 1/2 of that in beautiful Switzerland - and cooked to perfection!Marche is no more than a very expensive cafeteria or food hall, tourist beware !Not recommended

One of our nephews and his wife live in Singapore. While we were in Singapore on a short visit , they invited us to have dinner at Marche restaurant. This restaurant serves authentic Swiss food. We love Singaporean food. They are spicy and tasty. Eating Swiss food, while in Singapore, was not something we would have chosen to do. The restaurant was very close to the hotel we were in. We walked to the restaurant and met our nephew, his wife and her mother. My nephew has reserved a table for five people. The restaurant is in the basement of the building. You have to descend the steep staircase or take the elevator to get there. We took the elevator and it got stuck halfway for a few minutes and then started on its own after a few minutes. It is a big restaurant, almost packed to capacity. First you are directed to a table and then you can go round and select your food. We found they were serving grilled Wagyu beef as a discounted special. I and my wife selected Wagyu beef and a salad. It was typical Swiss food. Beef was of good quality, but somewhat bland, grilled without adding any spices . You have to add your own salt and other spices. It was a different experience and we enjoyed the food and the company
1
I don't suggest you go to Marche at 313 for breakfast as the cook has no idea how to cook the western items on the menu. The french toast was not dipped in butter, covered in honey instead of maple syrup (as advertised) and served cold. And don't ask for a cup of tea, it's not even on the menu.
3
Very convenient location at Somerset with mrt access. However very overpriced and overhyped. Good variety for the crowd but very average quality, with Long wait.
4
we were surprised to see a nice place in the basement of the mall. interior was ok, food was above average. service was great. price a little on the high side when you start buying a little of each. but it was worth the experience
4
Vege stuff, rosti, cakes, n crepes all my fav, ambience love it's, it's a office time with colleagues or with family or with friends perfect place to go to n either much a bite or tummy full. Suits best love it.
4
Great concept of a "market" selling fresh salads, seafood, chicken and pork with different sorts of swiss dish to savour for the weekend. Prices is a little bit on the high side but the environment and staffs were helpful. Worth a try!
5
Love the Crepes and Rostis over here! Abit price but well worth it considering the location that its like usually at Town area and hence price points are higher
3
I usually have a decent experience at Marche in Somerset at both the restaurant and takeaway counters but today, I noticed your staff was using the same green gloves to hold the sandwiches and handle cash from the register. I believe this is unacceptable as bills can be very filthy. To be fair, I don't believe this is a standard practise at this Marche, but please ensure this does not happen again. Thank you
2
This place was recommended but failed to live up to expectations. The main dish of the day, "Chicken Puff", was some very dry chicken encased in pastry that was too thick and undercooked. The staff displayed a couldn't care less attitude, not clearing away the dishes and not offering dessert. Even getting the bill seemed a big effort as they were too busy chatting to one another
3
Western food, buffet style at expensive prices. The concept is pretty interesting - you are given a card when you enter and you use it to order food on credit at the various stalls selling salads, crepes, roasted meats, seafood, drinks and dessert. But this concept is quite gimmicky given that the portions you order are large and expensive enough for a full meal and the card only gets used for one or two orders. *Queue gets quite long at the lovely rosti stall, so head there first if you're into rosti
4
The restaurant resembles a European fresh and organic slow food concept I've seen in Italy, Netherlands, Norway and Denmark. The ambiance is really good. It gives off an old rustic feel with the vibrance of an open market food court. There are different stations of food to your liking - pasta, fresh salads, grilled steak and sausages, rosti, seafood among others. It is a bit pricey but it lives up with your expectations. The only downside to this is their dessert. The cakes are dry. The panna cotta I got was less than average. Stay away from the dessert section.
5
If you really want to experience something different from routine , Marche is the place to be beautiful set up and tasty food .Expensive on pocket you may easily end up spending 100 SNG $ but worth the experience , it is basically a Swiss set -up 
5
Long lines on rosti but I love the most is their meat and paella.
Long queues outside but since their system is great you won't queue for more than 10 minutes.
4
Wide selection of choices. Salads, soups, pasta, meat cravings, Spanish food, seafood, desserts such as cakes and pastries. Great coffee, juices and selection of beer.
4
It's pretty interesting that they moved a Swiss Alpine village here and provide great foods:))) Especially love their desserts with such a big portion. Compare to standard expenses in Singapore, Marché is relatively worthy. If you fancy for European culinary delights, you should come!
4
Went there for snacks and coffee and made a great experience. Sandwiches are very tasty, service is friendly and fast.
Great location to stop and rest for a while and to spot passing shoppers.
5
Variety of fresh cook food such as pasta,steak,salad,fruit juice etc
Big space with quality food. You can choose your own choices, fresh salad is great!!!
4
After a long day of shopping in Orchard Road, I stopped at this bakery for an easy albeit late lunch. I had a focaccia and home made lemonade. It was tasty and reasonably priced. The location is great to being situated at the top of Orchard Road and close to the MRT
4
Marche has a tradition of "something for everyone". While its time-tested Rosti is well-loved, diners have a smorgasbord of pasta, pizza, salades, meats to choose from. The mushroom cream soup and banana nutella crepes are fantastic. Juices and blended drinks are thoughtfully crafted. Good venue for mixed groups of diners with varied dietary preference
4
Yes, you do get lost in the a-maze! I was a fIrst time visitor. My freind in Singapore took me for lunch.To me it was concept dining at best. Lots of stations to choose from-soups, breads, pasta, salads..... lots of stuff.TIP: Visit with more time on your hand, take time to enjoy, not a place to rush itWould love to go back agai
4
Marche was all along our go-to place for reunions with secondary school classmates and university mates. Now it has become my quiet dining spot, or simple meal spot with family. The Rosti, Paella, Crepe and desserts all taste the same-old-good way. And over these 10-over years, the prices haven't gone up too much. Commendable! And I hope the prices stay the same way too in future ;) Highly recommended now is the bakery, which is a convenient stop-by takeaway station where there are also several seats for a quick meal.
4
Met up with a group of ex-classmates whom some have not met for 20+ years. Better there early @ 11.30 (quite empty) or reserve in advance if you have a big group of 7 or more. Half of us took the roasted beef craving with mashed potato. Plus a large drink. Total cost about $28.
4
Went to Marche twice.
There's sooooo many options to choose from. Perfect place.
Had one of the best beers of my life...from the tap. Def reccomend it and also de potato.
4
love the concept and food has wide range of varieties. love the swiss rosti, it's a must for me.. also, nice place to chill and relax with family or friends.
5
A wild variety of food to choose from. Very different from local food center or buffets.A great place for family for a meal or two with kids n elderly. They offer some bread n pastry too !
5
Enjoy the various F&B offerings and selection available from the cornerstone of European cuisine. Definitely you'll eat to your heart's content.
3
Looks quiet from the street view but once you take your step to the basement, you be surprise by the crowd having their dinner. Good food and great coffee. Keep it up.
4
Definitely a good place for western cuisine. The place is spacious and stress free. You don't have to worry not having place to sit. Everything served looks fresh and clean.. Nice food.. Don't miss the pork knuckle.. Sausages & juices are great :) Value for money though slightly costly :
5
Amazing spread of food with a lot of variety,u order your own stuff and pay for it,,the ambeince of the farm they have made is just amazing to go with kids and with freinds,as everybody pay there own bill,there is no question of dividing the bill among freinds..pizza was nice ,i love there crepes and fresh juices..very yummy pastries cakes brownies and what not,..a must visit place of everyone...each dish cost around $ 12-$20,with juices pricing from $8-$15,A little pricey but good for once in a while.
5
A great self service outlet with a lot of variety of Italian and European food. Quaint and nice setting in Singapore where for a change you dont smell Asian food :DJuice counter and salad counter are also great. Dont leave without having a dessert from the pastry section. A little expensive but you will not regret visiting this outlet.
5
The place is very interesting. They have a lot of stalls where you can choose from salads, juices, meat, soups, pasta, pizzas, diferrent kind of breads, cake,etc.. they have a rostie potato with sour cream that is amazing you cann´t loose it. It is impossible you don´t have a special food to eet there
5
This is the best place for fresh food made right in front of your eyes. You can feel the freshness in each bite and know you are being nourished well with Swiss goodness to boot. Love the Caesars said with Chicken - the best I have had anywhere
4
Whenever I'm in Singapore I visit Marche for a take away roll to take to the office for lunch. The bread is amazing and they have a great variety of fillings.
3
Great concept.. But food portions ain't equal to all guests. Tried their paella, taste fine but not fully cooked.. Steal salmon not well seasoned but calamari was awesome.. Hope their portions will improve..
4
I dined with 3 friends at Marche @ 313 Somerset. We all found the food to be really fresh and tasty. The Swiss Rosti was particularly good. It would have been good to have tasted a few more dishes but there were too many choices. A great night out and highly recommended
4
This is one of our favourite restaurants. Used to be at nearby The Heeren mall before moving here. The decor/setting is very unique & beautiful, very European, very cosy & very SWISS!Coming here always bring back good memories of our Switzerland experience.Food is also good. We have tried many of their different food over the years & loved them.If you have not come to Marche before, try it out. It's worth the experience
4
Was with colleagues and we headed here for lunch.Thereâ€™s a wide variety of stall where you can pick what you like to eat, order and dine. Some stations are order and go, while others require some preparation time. So the server will pass you an electronic beeper which will alert you when your order is ready and you return later to pick up your food.Here are the items we had:- Caesar Salad: $10.90. My colleagues were salad lovers, so this was gone in no time. I loved the big pieces of freshly shaved Parmesan cheese.- Parma Ham Pizza: $22.90. Pizza topped with rocket leaves and Parma ham. Tasty.- Swiss Roti: $6.90. Rosti. The Russet potatoes are peeled and put through a slicer that grates a whole potato into loose pieces in seconds. It's then laden into a hot pan of hot oil, and fried till the outside is golden brown. A dollop of sour cream was added before serving. Also added a garlic sausage. This was good! It took 15 min for us to get our order, although the restaurant was half full. - Chicken Cheese Sausage: $7.50. This was a long thin sausage, which had bits of cheese in it. Careful when you eat, cos the cheese may squirt out. Not bad.- Garlic Sausage: $6.50. This had more flavour than the chicken cheese sausage. I preferred this more, as it had more flavour. - Seafood pasta: $10.90. This is the pasta of the day. It came with a small glass of homemade lemonade, as it was part of a set meal. Itâ€™s a baked pasta, so the server scooped out a portion and placed it on a plate. It was alright, except for the presentation. The ingredients were not much though/The meal was alright overall. The dining ambiance was like eating in a Swiss log cabin, which made it very cosy.I spent $97.70 for 5 pax
4
It was my maiden visit at Marche @ 313 Somerset. Had happened to be there for collection of free gift. After wandering around the 1st floor for 10mins for dinner, then by chance spotted this restaurant selling freshly baked breads and sandwiches. And they let the passers-by to try some samples before buying. Then decided to buy the ham and dried tomatoes sandwich and had a takeaway for the ham and cheese roll. The sandwich was simply delicious and would recommend couples or group of friends to spent their afternoon tea there in a nice and conducive environment
5
You could face queue in front... Which is normally good sign))Choice is amazing, staff attitude is great, atmosphere is busy and private same time.More tuned up for family, but crowds of couples out there as well.Freshest food, great coffee / desserts, excellent drinking and foods for drinking)Amazing variety.Love it and ready to go anytime I can get a seat
4
A cosy ambience for families to have their day outs. They have pizzas, pastas, rosti, Pork knuckle, sausages, crepes, paella, salads, soup, etc. if you come with a group of friends, don't worry who's paying 'cause each one is issued a card, which is used to track the food ordered by that particular person.
4
It was a good place to eat for us with our kids. There were a lot of choices so everybody can have "whatever they want" at Marche and we could enjoy the company of friends. Our kids "were noisy" but didn't matter as the place was "noisy". It took us a while though to chose our foods because of all the choices. Would definitely go back
5
We really enjoyed our lunch here at Marche. What I love the most is the concept of food market with top quality. It's a good way to enjoy and customize your food at the ambience of swiss restaurant. Here at Marche, you get to choose which food you like and watch it freshly prepared in front of you. Unlike the traditional restaurants that will just take your orders, at Marche you can walk around into different stations and select what you want. It's simply awesome.We love the meat section (it's really awesome!) and also the fresh coconut! Service is great as well. People thought it was expensive here but it's not. Prices are very reasonable with the serving that they have. Get to dine also on your birthday and get cool discounts. :)
3
They have good tasting food and pork knuckles. I do feel that some of the servers do not give amount of food equally to all customers although we are paying same amount.
4
This place is awesome. I love the convenience of the little card that you just add the food bill to as you go and the potato rostis are amazing!
4
When we went there we found many dishes that were vegetarian which was good but then the price was quite high. In the end everyone enjoyed but still have a feeling that it is expensive
5
A buffet with a great variety of foods. A unique way of charging by using a card to only pay for what you take. I had a Roast Beef special dinner which was thick cut like a Prime Rib. It was excellent!!
4
a lovely place to take a group of friends or family. A huge choice of hot food and desserts. Its a great experience. We try to visit, every time we come to singapore.
5
Completely organic and natural food. The Potato Roastie is the best along juices made of hand picked fruits of one's choice. Its got a lot of swiss appeal to it.
5
We've eaten here before on a previous visit to Singapore and couldn't wait to get back there. It's a great concept where you can self select from a huge range of food styles and fresh made dishes, desserts, fruit drinks and alcoholic drinks. The food always tastes great too
4
If you have visited Marché in Europe, the procedure is more or less the same, just in a smaller scale. As a group of people, you can eat different things. However some food is more popular than other, so it might be, you don't get to eat at the same time.
4
I really like Marchè for the quality of the food and reasonable prices. They have a wide range of choices and I love the lunch express offers.Also they bake the bread so you can also buy only a piece of focaccia or bread.It's usually quite busy in the weekend and lunch in weekdays so queues might br longer. If you go in not peak hours, the service is usually quick
4
Once we came down to big underground space, there is a big large nice market concept with multiple cooking stations. Food selection is reflect Swiss and European cuisines. Popular stations with long line but move quickly with chefs are working hard to cope with the demand.Drinks selection are large and atmosphere are nice for hang out, chit chat with friends or associates. With lots of hard surface, noise level is high but which brings this place alive
5
I've been to this place on every visit to Singapore. The ambiance is perfect, love the Swiss cottage atmosphere. The food is fresh, cooked right there in front of you. The choices are limited but there's always a waiting line.
5
Quality food at a budget-friendly price! Marché offers a wide range of Europe's delicacy. Superb ambiance and your food will be cooked/prepared as you order. Guaranteed fresh!
4
Went to Marche a few times before either to buy their delicious pastries/breads or giving myself a treat at their restaurant. So far their food has never disappointed and the tastes have been consistent throughout the years. Also very smart way to make their ordering of food cashless. Just yesterday, we had their express lunch sets - Chicken Cordon Bleu and Savoury Crepe that come with choice of a cold drink. Our lunch was quite late at around 2.30 pm and thereafter we took their tea break set of baked cheese cake and a choice of beverage. We didn't know about this weekday promotion until we were there as we know that Marche is expensive but quality is assured. Hope they will keep this promotion ongoing and I am sure fans will keep coming back
5
We happend across the 'little' Marche Movenpick bakery one morning when scouting for suitable breakfast locations. The deliciously fresh bakery items were very well priced and delicious. We'd noticed the evening before that there was a huge line up to get in, and I wondered where all these people were going to fit. I noticed that there was a partially obscured staircase, and while the rest of the family were finished, I decided to have a look.WOW!The place was amazing. Beautiful fresh produce was everywhere, ready to be freshly cooked by the chefs at each station, and the prices were relatively cheap. After living in PNG for 9 months, the sight of cheap, good quality fresh produce is enough to get you salivating. I marched back up the stairs to announce that I had found our location for dinner that night
4
If you can't decide what to eat. Marche is a good place to dine out. There are tons of food to choose from. We tried roesti, steak, grilled fish and ice cream for dessert. Roesti was a hit together with the grilled mahi-mahi. Ice cream was also good (I think it's movenpick) with unlimited toppings. Definitely a must try
5
From the outside, you'll see a sort of Deli shop, but i was intrigued why there were people going down... My cousin one time brought me there for lunch and i was amazed how big the area was below that deli store! Great ambiance too!Upon entry, you will be given a card. The card will be used to note your every food order from the different stations.... After enjoying the food, present the card upon exit and pay.I cant rememeber what we have ordered and eaten, but am sure i came out with a happy tummy!!
5
The location is at 313 shopping mall at orchard road. Its near to sommerset mrt station. We ordered a salmon steak and a roast beef. The salmon steak is nice according to my friend and the roast beef is ok. We also ordered a banana crepes which is really good with a scope of vanilla ice cream
4
We took our two Australian visitors who were having a stopover in Singapore for dinner to Marche, we were fortunate to get a table immediately and found the service to be excellent. The variety was good and our visitors had never been to a Marche before so the concept was something they experienced for the first time. All up was very good
5
From Sirloin steak to pasta, soups, juices and desserts there is something for everyone in this unique fresh food market. Most of it is good value, beer is a little on the expensive side as was the wine. The decor was wonderful and the set up very nice. Reconmend an early seating as there is usually a long queue at 7pm
4
I have to say that this is the first time I see a swiss restaurant outside Switzerland...Anyway the place is really nice, small playground for kids inside makes it ideal for families.The idea is really intriguing as the restaurant is like a small market place, where you can find different types of food served by independent kiosks.Nice roti, crepes and sweet corner.An unusual experience to try!Also nice breads on top floo
2
I'm personally like Marche decoration and the way they set up stall for foods and drinks. The outlet at Vivo City was good. But this outlet @313 Somerset was bad experienced. My Paella was tasteless and prawns wasn't fresh as same as mussel.
5
A terrific taste of cuisine variety in the centre of the major shopping location, Marche provided a quite resting spot at affordable price. Great food and service, and clean.
5
Excellent food. I had a chance to dine at Marche. I was wondering why there is a long line. Wow, their food is truly amazing.
4
The outlet is like a food court with a diffrence. It is a part of Movenpick. there are various separate counters offering different swiss and european foods and separate counters for drinks and beverages
4
I come here usually for lunch and I like this place for their extremely welcoming and friendly staff, interesting interior and fresh food ingredients display. Their swiss rosti and crepes are so good. I like the variety of fresh beverages and juices. And the bakery upstairs mmmm so tasty! My favourite bread there is walnut brot and I like tomato and mozzarella sandwich. Desserts are sinfully delicious too :
5
I always buy my breakfast at Marche, as it's on my way to work. I love their breads, sandwiches and desserts, they taste like food I used to have back home (in Romania) - especially the bread!Staff are always smiling and service is fast :
5
So much tasty food it is hard to know where to start! You arrive and get given a plastic card and then can go to a vast array of food stalls and get anything you want, swipe your card, eat, go back for more, and then when you exit you pay for what you got. It is fast efficient and so worth going.Nice drinks, excellent food, great atmosphere
5
I loved the setting of this place. On top it's like a typical cafe, but go downstairs and it's like you've entered a Swiss village!!The concept is amazing. Yoirengiven a card on which your purchases are billed and you oay the bill at checkout. There are tons of options to choose from. There's pizzas and pastas and meats and desserts and beverages and lots more. We had a grand time just looking around and trying SO HARD to choose something!The food is delicious. The rose tea was something different, and really nice. The apple pie was scrumptious.We left with happy bellies highly recommend
3
When i go for shopping at Sommerset 313 i always visit marche restaurant. Have a lot of choices of european style food. Meat and fish are not always very fresh, but have to know whst to choose. Fried potatoes swiss style are too oily and most of the time not enough cooked. Pizza not bad, thiny chrunchy crust but too oily.Dessert quite good. High prices but its normal for european style food in Singapur.Nice and usefull sandwich and salad take away at the entrance. Always crowdy.See you asap
5
Marche at Somerset 313 was designed to look like a marketplace where different stalls served premium meals such as salads, rostis, crepes, grills, pizza and pasta, and desserts, among others. Highly recommended are the salmon crepes and rostis, grilled steaks and lamb chops, and the Margherita pizza. The location at Somerset 313 is central to Singapore's Orchard Shopping District, and is accessible via the Somerset MRT station and bus stops. The prices are reasonable for the quality and freshness of the food. Overall, Marche at Somerset 313 is a restaurant worth revisiting for all types of occasions
4
Always spoiled for choice ... I pick it .. they make it .. Loved the grill.. especially the veal sausages. And the desserts! The strawberry shortcake was delish
4
Large choice of food without much sophistication.
Rosti patatoes are very good. Fried calamari too. Large choice of vegetables. Desserts are ok but quite standard.
Fresh juices are attractive. Beer and wine choice quite limited.
4
I always love to visit Marche and try out their European cuisines which we will not find anywhere else in Singapore. Visit there during your birthday as there will be on going promotions available for you :)
4
The idea of eating in a food market makes this restaurant unique in itself. I enjoy the chicken sausages here, very differently cooked along with some fresh squeezed juices
5
Every morning we would stop off and buy a cheese and ham roll and these's small Dutch like donuts all for about 4sgd
You can't walk passed without smelling beautiful smells coming out of this little store.
5
The food is fresh and delicious!
Very reasonably priced and the staff are very helpful and accommodating to special requests.
4
I first ate in this Swiss restaurant in Dresden hauptbahnhof a few years back. Marche restaurants are usually located at train stations, or airports and any frequented places but serving healthy and high quality food. I like the way they present the different array of food choices ranging from pastas to grilled meats and the big salad bar. There's even paella..which was very good as well. It's a great place if you have kids, or if you have friends who have different kinds of food craving. You just get a card and pick whatever suits your food fancy! It's a bit noisy so don't think of having a serious conversation here like business or romantic dining but the warmth Alpine interior is typical of the restaurants I've been to in Zurich. Excellent location at Sommerset
4
You get a card pr person when you arrive, you order all the food you want at the huge buffet showing the card, and then settle the check on the card once you leave. It's simply and easy as is the food. There is a huge selection of everything from pizza/pasta to grilled meat and fish and a huge salad bar. The food is nicely displayed and you will be spoilt for choice. There is a play area for kids with a playhouse which is well worn down but it does the trick. The food is ok to good and the prices are relatively fair
4
Will vouch for the restaurant any day Be its concept of picking your own fresh ingredients or the staff making it live for you or it's ambiance and decor. full marks. Luved the food. The juices were excellent.Though the pizza pasta lady was overworked. The poor woman should be given some help
4
Quite liked the entire set-up. Even though it wasn't a buffet, but still each one could manage on their own and see/pick-up food for themselves...even the kids enjoyed the concept of looking at all the options and then picking up stuff they like...everything we tried was nice!!
4
I liked the concept of the restaurant. It is great if you go as a large group, it helps as you can taste more variety of food. The preperations are fresh. The food is great and so is the beer.
4
Pizza was pretty good. Not much tomato sauce and the crust was a bit dough-er than I am used to. Service was good. Prices reasonable.
5
We had some french and swiss food together starting with wine and mussels, than a roesti and some other foods. Really liked the fresh state of the food.
5
A perfect place to quench your thirst and satisfy your hunger with family after a day of sightseeing around Orchard road or all day shopping. JUST a minute walk from Hotel JEN where we stayed with my family, the place is a perfect setting if you are looking for healthy foods from a selection of European, American, and Asian food. What I love was the fruit and veggie area where you can order for your own favorite preparation or concoction.The place is very homely...loose...natural in a modern location....and at the center of the shopping centers in Singapore...A must see or visit while in Singapore. PRIZES affordable depending on your choice and preparation of the food
5
March! We went there sometime back. We loved the market concept and it was a new experience to me and my husband. We went with our friends and we ordered different different food so that we got a chance to taste each ones food. Loved the rosti and the thin crust Pizza we had. We will come back for sure in our next visit to Singapore
4
When craving "western food" this is a great place to go to. It's mainly swiss food but they also have some german, italian and french cuisine. It feels like being in Europe, the design is great, the stalls are cute and the staff is friendly. It's a little bit more expensive than other food courts but it's worth it
5
One of the best places I have ever had the pleasure of dining in. From the beginning the atmosphere is simply enchanting and transforms you from the malls of Singapore to the hills of Switzerland. The rustic wood interiors the various sheep and lambs and St Bernards. You could be in the middle of a scene out of Heidi.The concept of the restaurant is unique and carers to all sorts of people from the picky eaters ( our kids ) to the ones who are perhaps straight from Switzerland themselves or those like me who came across live rosti or paella or savory crepe counters for the first time ever. The food was excellent more so cos you could see exactly what and how much you would get before you actually place the order. We loved the rosti with cheddar the roast chicken stuffed crepes the roasted chicken wings the sea food paella and the wonderful refreshing orange juices. The eclairs to end the meal were excellent fresh and light.We visited Marche twice in a four day trip which explains how impressed we were by place the concept the food and the service. Great job done.I would give this place a 5 stars from my side. If in Singapore this is a must visit

Seems not enough staff to attend each stall. I was at the bruschetta stall waiting to be attend thus wait till 10 mins no body attending me. There was a staff came by but she just did her things. She didn't even ask whether I've been attend by someone. And in the drink counter I asked for moscato the lady asked how many ml, I moved few steps back to check the menu. Few seconds am back she is gone, attending someone else request. Fine, I would just wait, after 10 mins she was still attending other customer then I left.

This restaurant was unique in that there were many "stations" each offering freshly prepared foods of different varieties. A huge salad bar and separate desert bar offered so many choices. You just ordered what you liked and presented the food preparer your card for the costs to be added. Pay for what was added as you were leaving. I was impressed with both atmosphere and food quality. I'd definitely recommend this restaurant.
5
We ate here on several occasions on our recent visit to Singapore, the best thing about it is you can wander around and see what's on offer instead of deciding from a menu, it is casual dining therefore if you're on a big night out might not be for you. The breakfast selection is vast. They also do lunch and dinner, a great place for freash,freash food
4
We ate here for dinner and I was amazed by the place. It is something unique. It is like a marketplace where you can buy fresh foods of different options. It was Swiss inspired restaurant.
2
Nothing special
Honestly spend $38 for lunch, It's much better than a set lunch in a restaurant with the best quality of food
5
Catered for the whole family - hubby happy with beer and pizza, 15mo and myself fed with yummy pasta. My little one loved the play area and the fact they gave out balloons on sticks on exit. The balloon kept him entertained for hours in the hotel room

Marche is a unique dining experience. You pick out the food, they cook it and you get it fresh. Not your typical restaurant where you sit down and order from a set menu. You actually get to choose what you eat.If you're really hungry, make tour way to the pasta/pizza station first as it takes some time to prepare. Then go about choosing your other food items.Comments about the place:1. There is no service water or complimentary water. Tou have to pay like $4.50 for a bottle. I think it's too much. Get yourself juice instead. 2. Wine costs too much.3. A little cramped during peak hours.Other than that, the place is good
4
We went here for dinner and could not believe the extent of the choices on offer. Pasta. Crepes. Rosti. Steak and so much more. Something for everyone! Great value for money- except the wine. 200ml was s$28!!!! We all had something different and had no complaints.
4
We recently found Marche and it has become a favorite of our kids. They like the variety of choices such as crepes, pizza, pasta, soup, salad, paella, fish, and meat. Marche has a set up of different stations to choose your food and then you give them a card to keep track of your purchases. At the end of your meal you take your cards to the cashier to pay. It can get a bit pricey depending on what you order.The array of choices makes is an ideal place for picky eaters and it is very kid friendly

Visited this morning for their breakfast meal. Ordered eggs benedict set and pizza set. Eggs benedict was so so though the pizza is okay. Actually food is a bit pricey for the taste but its the ambience of the place that we like. Major disappointment are staff attitude. We go in at around 11am, dont have a lot of customers, the lady staff (looks Malay)at the Pizza area was really rude, her way of questioning us of what we want sounds like it really upset her that we go on her area though we are her only customer. I really don't understand why she seems mad at us even until we took our prepared orders. I only saw her smile when her co-staff pass her a cake (we sat near her area). Also, the Filipino receptionist guy (Vincent) is about the same as her, rudely take our card to swipe and tap like mad when we ordered for our drinks though the lady at the juice bar is nice. Service is bad on our opinion and its not like we are asking for a special treatment and they are not even busy on that time! They could train their staff to be friendlier to have a better customer service and don't treat customers that we owe them. Not coming back on this restaurant again
4
We were staying in a hotel in Orchard Road so often needed a coffee and snack. This is a great little bakery with hot drinks and wonderful pastriescakes and snacks at very reasonable prices ( much cheaper than Costa Coffee opposite and better). The staff were all very friendly. It would be a nice place to take children as at the side of the ground floor are moving mountain animals on a mini rock face that is cute. There is a large cow outside the cafe so you can't miss it! There are some tables so you can sit next to them. There is alaso a lift to the basement which we did not go down, I noticed other reviews mention meals down there but we only had coffee and cake. I would definitely go here again if I was near Orchard Road
4
Suitable for family or groups gathering. Have a play area for kids which is an advantage for family who have kids. Variety of foods and beverage to choose from, must try swiss rosti and salmon crepe. Our top favourite at here. Juice is freshly squeezed or can order directly from the staff. For dessert, we would go for waffles with ice-cream
4
If ambience makes your meal more interesting, then it has to be Marche at 313 Somerset. An impressive Swiss shop front showcases the deli on the street food level. Stairs and a glass lift lead to the restaurant premises in the basement. The restaurant is very well decorated with live cooking stations decked out with food ingredients and serving a variety of cooked and grilled food, salads, desserts and beverages. Pockets of seats are laid out throughout the restaurant to suit the most fastidious of diners.Orders are individually cooked and collected by the diners from the live cooking stations. You can order as much or as little as you want. The interesting interior decor and interactive dining experience of ordering your own food at the live stations bring dining to a different level.A great venue for families and those with children who expect more of their dining than satisfying their hunger pangs
4
There were a nice juice bar for freshly squeezed carrot juice. The Swiss or German sausages were very tasty. I particularly like the desserts especially with fresh cream and custard.
5
Good varied food, in bright clean surroundings and served by friendly welcoming people very family friendly too
3
At Marche, we found a nice little aircond play area for our kids while we have coffees and light meals. They have little kids house and train set etc. Its nice family friendly place.
4
I have been here twice and I have to say that I am surprisingly pleased with their services. Queues are being managed in a timely manner and tables were quickly cleaned. Prices were reasonable compared to, say, Dean & Deluca at the next building. The breads are the star here as well - and their waffles are fluffy. Juices are fresh with no added preservatives. Food portions are big - good for sharing
3
A good place to get together with friends, ambiance is warm and inviting. We went there for dinner on a Friday night and there were a lot of choices that even picky eaters would get to find something that would stimulate their appetite. Dining setup is similar to a buffet setting where you can find several stations that serves salad, pasta, grilled meat, their famous rosti, dessert, and lots more. Each meal for dinner costs around $10-20+. Food is fresh and served by friendly staff
4
A good place to be for almost any customer. Friendly staff and cosy dining area with family friendly utensils and equipments makes dining experience at Marche pleasant. An especially great place to be for group gatherings and family outing. Food quality in above average and definitely not shabby. Would definitely recommend this restaurant
5
This is one of the best experiences we have had. The food is great - swiss cuisine is a little rare - so this was a very different experience. Food is wonderful and so are the people - they help out pick and order your food. Desserts are in particular yummy ! Roshti is a particular dish that I will recommend everyone to have 
3
I found this place simple food with large variety and precooked or quick cooked. So for busy people and big families this place is perfect. Always queues in peak hours. My 4th visit was my last as I ordered the fish dish as I wanted to try leaner healthy foods. I was satisfied with my fish. Not blown away. It's simple food as expected as can never be restaurant quality. Yet they still close to restuarant prices. Anyways I got sick that evening. Was terrible and my doc and I could only equate it to the fish. Since then I've never had food problems and never returned to Marche somerset. I can't recall any memorable meals there so can't help you on that. The staff appeared friendly. Remember food left out for long has the risk of picking up tons of bacteria and I had my severe bad luck that day.
3
For a place that advertises itself as a 'fresh market' restaurant the selection and way the food is prepared is decidly not so healthy. I was looking for a salad bar. Bottom line - definitely do not come here for salad - the prices are horrible (for the salad bar) and the selection of fresh veggies is quite poor as well. I also had a 'grilled chicken wing' that had so much oil on it I might as well have had a Ben and Jerry's instead. That being said, if you're in the mood for seafood paella, rosti with various toppings, pizza and pasta (decidedly not health food) then I actually would recommend going here. The Rosti and seafood Paella are both really tasty...maybe better than Ben and Jerry's...with a dietary profile to match ;)
4
At first, you might think MarchÃ© @ 313 looks like it just sells bread and pastries, but surprisingly, there's a whole food court type european restaurant below that range from Pizzas, Rostis, Steaks and Sausages, Salads, and much more! Choices (proportion and price) of the food given can be overwhelming. But there's always the lunch deals that can help you get a safe yet still good option.Only con I have is that the Rosti can be a bit too greasy. But maybe just me being picky.If you wanna enjoy a good hearty meal in Somerset, then this is definitely a great choice
5
there are different kind of foods to choose from. i specially love the pizza with greens as toppings. This place is always packed with so many people. the restaurant settings is amazing!
4
Loved the place and the ambience! Nice, fresh food with a lot of vegetarian options and a lovely play area for the children. Really an awesome concept and experience.
5
If you are looking for good food, reasonable price, I think Marche Restaurant is the place.It is one of these places with different kind of 'stalls', but very clean and fresh - where you can choose pasta/pizza, seafood, crepes, juices, desserts etc. The decor goes really well with the idea of the restaurant - it looks like you are in a farmer's market, but indoors. It's busy, but clean and food is super delicious. My husband and I had wood fired margueritta pizza for dinner followed by a delicious crepe with mascarpone cheese. We loved the place, so much that we decided to come back on Saturday for breakfast - we had savoury crepe, the best we've ever had and a sweet breakfast with french toast, fresh strawberries and maple syrup - simply amazing.Monday to Friday they offer a la carte menu in each station, and Saturday and Sunday there few a la carte menu, or established combos
4
This was the place I chose to visit when I feel very hungry and I had quite amount of money in my pocket. There was lots of food to choose, from salad, main courses until desserts, but the price was quite high. I had roasted pig leg with mashed potato and a lemonade. When I hadn't feel satiated, I continued to have a pie, big one. I admired the interior design a lot, couldn't imagine how the designers struggled for all the details. I also still could feel good atmosphere although this place was full of people, especially around dinner time
5
If you're looking for a different experience, this is a great place to try. The ambiance is very inviting--a feast for the eyes--yet also kid-friendly, with a dedicated play area. The farm-fresh produce, cheeses and baked goods provide some familiar fare so there's something for everyone. At the same time, you'll find unique offerings due to the Swiss influence. The seasonal veggies and quality meat and seafood ingredients are evident, as your food is prepared before your eyes. Their refreshing fruit drinks are also on made on the spot. Ordering is done at different stations throughout the restaurant, similar to a buffet except selections are added to each persons ticket, Ã  La Carte. For your drinking friends, yes there is also a bar! Lots to enjoy here and I will definitely return next time I'm in Singapore
4
I love to eat at Marche @ 313 Somerset. It is great if you invite guests cause all you need us to pick up their charge cards and pay for them at the end of the meal. There is a wide variety of food to choose from and the price is reasonable. The food is fresh and sumptuous
5
When I am in Singapore I always like to stop by at Marche and had nice pretzel, sandwich or other bakery product just on my way to somewhere. Now I see they added tall tables and stools and as well they serve coffee. Definitely great place for coffee break
4
This place is great for a quick meal with a nice ambience and very fresh juices and food. We visit often (2-3 times a week) and the only complaint is the lack of variety for vegetarians. There are some excellent veg options though and yum deserts. They also have a nice Heidi house play room to keep the kids entertained and interesting Chicky toys / puzzles with kids meals. Recommended as long as you're not skeptical about eating Swiz food in Singapore :
4
By far Marche is the best place to get freshly made food and deserts with a good price tag. The salad bar has good varieties, the Rotisterie has many options which you can choose to be made just infront of you. The pizza and pasta station has fresh pizzas and pasta, which are nicely done. The only drawback is the hefty price tag for the drinks where normal mineral water costs you 3.5$ and a normal juice costs you 6 to 8$. It is a perfect place for family and friends gathering.
4
Yum - I had a lovely wholemeal baguette with Ham and Swiss cheese here. I had it fresh, but they would have toasted it for me. I was a generous size, good serving of ham and fresh Swiss Cheese. All good. The range of breads and sandwiches is good, come here if you're hungry for bread
4
Well Well Well from the Pork knuckle to the Paella to the Rosi with Pork sausage..... Need I say more.... Man oh man oh man this is good eating..... I love it here and always look forward to eating @ marche
4
Nice selection, good bread, great combinations of flavors. I loved the ham, turkey, and pumpkin pizza!
4
Its a restaurant with good ambiance ,great variety of food.Loved the cream of asparagus soup.Its a great place to be with friends.
4
Totally loved the paella! The pork knuckles were good, but could be a bit tough. The rosti is awesome
4
This a such an incredible casual dining experience - whoever you are, single, couple, family, kids there is really something for everyone - and its fresh...The concept that you have a charge card given to you when you arrive and can wander to various stations and pick up a salad, move to the next station add a particular type of meat or fish, move on again and add vegetables, move on again and pick up a beer or glass of wine is really superb.The variety of items on offer are plentiful and numerous and more importantly are of good quality and fresh. Staff are very helpful and will assist every step of the way. If you want something cooked in a particular way - just ask. there are chefs standing there waiting to cook for you and in front of you. At the end of the meal, take the "charge card" you were given to the till and pay for the items you had chosen. This place is a serious boon if you have kids who can be trusted to choose their own meal and have it how they want it. real fun for all concerned
2
I generally avoid dining at hot spots of Orchard but decided to try this place on a friend's recommendation. Honestly, this place was a let down. Apart from the ambiance, which I would say is interesting, the food was slightly below average and given the price you pay, I was bitterly disappointed. To add to the disappointment, service was bad. I guess I will continue to avoid hot spots in Orchard
4
It was time for lunch and *April and I decided to head for an old school's favorite for years - Marche Restaurant, the outlet at 313 Somerset. I am sure Marche needs no introduction - a large marketplace concept, lined with many different stalls selling different cuisine food - from duck leg confit to potato rosti to desserts etc. All that we needed to do was walk around with a card for the stalls to record our purchases, so that we could make payment collectively at the end of our meal.For sharing, we had two items. First, the famous Rosti - pan fried potato topped with sour cream and spring onions (around SGD$15.00). This has always been a comfort food, crispy and tasty in its simplicity.We also shared the Salmon Ham Crepes - shaped up like spring rolls. The smoked salmon and ham fillings contrated beautifully with the very-gently sweet crepe skins, panfried to a lovely chewy (slightly crispy) texture.We wanted desserts but were full so we left after enjoying our satisfying meal at Marche. For full review, please visit: http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/11/lunch-at-marche-restaurant-313-somerset.htm

What's your definition of good service? At least staff who responds politely and not ignore you? Went to Marche for our annual gathering on Saturday.... Visited the place last year too... The first response was service at drinks section sucks... Same as last year. They either ignore you or doesn't seem to bother. They offer a drink called Chai tea but whenever someone orders the drink, they always seem so reluctant to make it..... Supposed need 10 mins to make the drink. If it's so much work for the staff then don't offer the drink. (The Caucasian staff at the drink counter really has an attitude problem).Apparently most station staff are like that.... From the soup station to crepes to salad to cold drinks section... It's unbelievable. They make one feel that we owe it to them by asking them to cook or prepare food. I really hope the management will be reading the review here and seriously look into the service attitude of its staff. Marche can stay for do long in Singapore because they have no direct competitors but don't slack and think that this will last forever.Do pay them a visit and experience how atrocious service can be
4
One of the best place to have authentic swiss rosti and pork knuckles. Service station/staff clean and friendly. Clearing of used plates on table could be improved as we werent even dining during peak period yet lots of used plates were stacking up.Acceptable price range for quality of food delivered. Definitely the place to go when there's craving for rosti
5
A restaurant today is so much about the atmosphere, the feel good factor and not for the food alone. Theme style restaurants therefore thrive and carve a niche for themselves, trying to make the diners have not only their appetites sated but also their hearts content! We all eat to our heart's content when we have good food and this is what I tended to do when my friend took me to Marche during one of my visits to Singapore! Let me start by saying that the experience was amazing right from the time I stepped in! The decor made me feel as if I had landed in a quaint corner of Switzerland. With food all around you, a foodie like me tended to get confused on where to start. The menu and price boards are not the first things you notice and so one stands the risk of getting carried away and picking up more than what is necessary. That you just have to swipe the card makes matters worse coz you tend to get carried away if you are not too careful. And prices in Marche are not cheap, mind you. I did however enjoy the ambience and the food. The village market place like ambience is novel and the sight and aroma of food floating all around only helps to fuel the appetite. The roseti with sausage is excellent and so is the grill counter serving fish and meat. The choice of drinks too is varied and one is really spoilt for choice here. A single visit to this place is just not enough and one needs to come twice or thrice to savour a the items they offer. The one thing that I liked best about this place? Well, every table had this tag to indicate whether it's reserved or empty. So one could just while away as much time at the food counters without worrying about the table being captured by some other diner!
3
Had the potato rosti and its always nice to have it. Bread are not so nice because it's very hard. It's ok to try them once but not all the time.
4
A wonderful evening out had a light but delightful meal.... Always enjoy the rosti with sausage yum yum yum.... Good till the last bite.
5
They are offering a lot of types of food and my favorite is the crepes. All type of it. It so nice watching them prepare it in front of you
4
If you want to go to a place and find a good variety of food then you must go here as you will find good food anytime of the day. I 've been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner and was not disappointed any time.
4
I super love their pastries. Not so sweet but so tangy. What I like the best with marche is the ambiance they have. So relaxing
3
The restaurant has a number of counters for different food items and one for drinks. It is totally self-service. You are given a card when you enter. You go to the counters, select what you want and have your card swiped. In the end, you give your card to the cashier who would bill you.In my case, the choice of food was limited because I don't eat seafood. Even the choice of drinks was limited because they didn't have any whiskey. I can't comment on the quality of what I ate because I am a votary of Indian food
5
Visited a first of its kind Market Restaurant. Variety of food options. Go to specific stall .. order the food and enjoy. Amazing stuff. Opens till 10.30 -11 pm ..so dont be late. The staff are really helpful. Enjoyed every moment. Have Good options for vegetarians also
1
I visited this restaurant at the end of September for lunch. I ordered food from the pasta/pizza counter, grilled meat, soup, wine. The staff mending these counters were all Filipino foreign workers. They all had an indifferent attitude. Most were even rude, refused to answer simple queries, or gave discourteous responses. At the end of the meal, I gave my feedback form to a Caucasian manager, and he too seemed to be indifferent to his rude workers. I wonder why any patron would want to spend money in a restaurant and to be abusedd, and a management who did not give a damn about customers' feedback. I will never step back into this rotten joint again. People complain about Singaporeans' anti-foreign attitude. Well, with crude foreigners like these in Marche, I would surely support a policy of expelling them all out of my country
4
We arrived about 6 pm for an early dinner. When I came in, the first thing that caught my attention once in the dining area was the atmosphere. I love the country style, something Swiss, deli, etc. Its not the typical restaurant where you will choose from the menu and be served. Here, you get to pick what you want to eat and tell them how it should be done, from pasta, to pizza, to grilled meats, or salad, anything. You must try their mushroom soup, one with roasted whole mushroom, its filling, especially for light eaters. Btw, I noticed that they served big portions but not as much as american servings. Enjoy Marche
1
Noisy and expensive, I wonder what the fuss is all about ! 28 S$ for a small glass of wine is ridiculous even by Singapore standards !!! Staff is neither nice or helpful so really with the unlimited choices of restaurants you have in the city, you can cross this one off your list !!
3
i like the food but i super love their vivo city branch. the place is a little smaller too. i prefer to visit the vivo city branch next time
5
I particularly like the lunch specials - a few choices for under S$10 with drink. Besides the special, you can always get a sandwich, salad, vegetables, soups, paella, etc. Nice!
4
A lot of food varities in a very reasonable price. Quite a lot of people during Friday and weekends. Pasta and Meat section is very good, for $18-21 pizza and pasta, with a good dine-in ambiance not bad.
5
Easy to find and the food was delicious.. go downstairs for restaurant...it was not much crowded in week time..take away also possible if you get full...
4
I was in Singapore for 3 weeks and when I craved western style food, this was my goto place. It is in a mall and is a Swiss restaurant where you can go to different stations and order different things. Nothing fancy, but easy to navigate and decent food. I particularly enjoyed the rosti and the salmon steak
4
This is a great place to eat in Singapore when you're not looking for the local delicious stuff. Marche has a lot of variety for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The range varies from Spanish to Swiss (obviously!) to salads and desserts. My favourite thing to eat there is the roesti. They just make it so well that I can never replicate it at home. The price range varies and I would say the place is a good value for money
4
Queue moved fast. Concept great! Food great, though much better if you're in a large group sharing wider portions! Could improve on queue space for popular stalls as got very crowded. Some stalls were not that flexible (pasta chef could only work dishes on the menu)
4
Good concept ...its like going to a farmhouse and choosing the ingredients yourself. You might miss to this as the restaurant is in the basement. This place has all fresh ingredients and choose from salads, crepes, seafood, pizza, juices. All gets cooked in front of your own eyes. Creates a master chef feeling for you. Homemade drinks must tr
5
I always wondered why people would wait in line for a table at this restaurant. Now I know why. You are greeted by a member of staff downstairs who gives you a card for each person. You find your own table. Once your seated make sure to flip the sign in the middle of the table to say reserved. You then go and help your self. There is many counters to choose from. They also serve alcohol. Once your ordered your food you hand over your card that you were given when you first came in to the chef so they can add it to your account. The portions are large and the food is very good. Once you have finished go to the till and present your card. Everything you've had will be on that card. I would go back again
5
Enjoyed the ambiance so much. It's my first time to try out something like this. A marketplace concept where food is very fresh and the card system works so well with it. It was a nice swiss experience with great food, awesome service and friendly staff! Will definitely be back for more
5
I had the best lunch here with my colleagues ..loved the concept, service and the quality of food..I highly recommend everyone to visit marche #anupamnair
5
Food is nice & fresh, selection of dishes unbelievable large. Beer excellent. Always going there for lunch when in Singapore. Highly recommended.
5
A market place for a restaurant. Very lively, unlimited options. Perfect for all multiple occasions. Our kid loved it.
5
We'd been to Singapore and were looking for something unique. Fortunately for us, one among us knew this place and had been here. The concept and the interiors are simply superb! I don't want to elaborate on it, you'll get it in the internet (helps my laziness at this point as well :-)) Anyway, coming to food - very fresh, very tasty and everything we got tasted great! The food is mainly European. They have fresh fruit juice, tea/coffee, bakery stuff and quite a large counter for a variety of desserts. The portions are quite large too.For all is vegetarians out there, there's plenty!!We had a sumptuous meal and were very satisfied at the end of it!! 6 of us are for about sing-$120 .. very decent indeed! I'd certainly recommend this place.
5
I loved Marche! There is fantastic variety and everything is so so fresh. I loved the concept of the store. The card swiping was a little clumsy, but seemed to work just fine. I had Paella on one occasion and caesar salad on another with black sesame cheese cake and it was spectacular every time went. There is lots of variety and they will make it just the way you like it. The staff were very accommodating to the brash American, who had ridiculous requests, who was in front of me in the line at the salad station. I thought the automatic wooden bathroom door was quite novel. I highly recommend it if you enjoy good, healthy and hearty food and need an escape from the deep-friend world of asian cuisine on offer in Singapore
5
Nothing beats the freshly made Swiss Rotti here in Marche. I usually order this food comes with Pork Garlic Sausage with a Greek yogurt on the side. You can top up it with a zest lime and herbs. Then their home made Margarita pizza oozing with Parmesian and mozarella cheese is awesome. The Marche venue in Somerset is perfect to dine-in after a long walk of shopping and sightseeing in the Orchard road
4
I have come as a tourist to Singapore but seen only places which are shown by the guide but after staying in Singapore I have visited somerset mall more than twice and it feels like amazing.one of the best malls I have been in Singapore and the variety of stores and clothing they have is fantastic. Whenever my friends tell me to go shopping I am always ready to go because I like this place and the mall so much
5
My friend whos staying in singapore suggest this restaurant for us to take dinner, she said its a buffet type that u will only pay what you get. When we get inside the its full of food like ur in the market were u get foods from one stall to another and just bring it to your table. The foods itself are all delicious and you can actually pay only to the food that you really want to eat unlike in buffet that youll pay for eberything in it. Price is reasonable with the experience plus the quality of food its really a good and unique dining experience. I would love to go back here if theres a chance. Will suggest this to my friends who will visit in SG.
3
My first glance into lunch at Marche @ 313 Somerset was of the fresh juice counter with lovely combinations like Lemongrass and Ginger and Cucumber and Lime. That with a Roasted Turkey Ceasar Salad for S$10, can't be beat in the CBD! The concept with a stored card on which to load up your food charges, clean tables and kitch atmosphere was a pleasant change. I forgot I was in Singapore for a while...
5
Walking into Marche, I was immediately impressed with this concept. It's not a buffet â€¦ but it's got all the stations like an American style buffet restaurant. However, there is not the food waste, because you pay for what you take. I had a fantastic caesar salad with a baked potato. My kids had pizzas, and my husband had grilled chicken. We all enjoyed our meals. I really wanted to get some ice cream for dessert, but was too full. It was a busy place, full of activity, but there was plenty of seating and we never had to wait for our food, the pizza took the longest but it was made to order. The decor was great too, very nicely decorated, in fact reminded my kids a bit like Disney. We will be returning to Marche, as it is one of a kind in Singapore!
5
Loved the concept, the food and the service! The range of food was great and the quality brilliant. We will definitely go back next time we are in Singapore!
2
If you use to go to a bakery or European, then you ll see that the quality is very low and not tasty....Therefore to avoid
5
I was introduced to Marche and it was so easy to enjoy.Just walking into the Resturant you are faced with a simple but authentic look of Swiss/German look and feel.You receive a card similar to a credit card upon entry and then you just walk around the area and find what you like and order it, they cook or make it in front of you, then you hand over you card and they scan it and you can return or go anywhere else as many times as you want for food, drinks and then don't pay until you wish to leave.I found the food selection fantastic and a very wide variety of options for all tastes. I would recommend anyone to try this experience in Singapore or in one of the many other restaurants
5
This restaurant is all together based on a different concept. at first you would feel that this place serves just breads but the real place is downstairs where you feel as if you are in some hypermarket.You are provided with a card so you can order whatever you wish to have. Get the card swiped and pay in the end.Loved this new concept and the food was also lovely.I tried potatoes with sausages and fresh juice

Came to marche as my daughter wanted to eat rosti. It was my birthday and we had bought a cake for home later. My daughter also had half a Boost drink. At the door we were first told that we could not come in with outside food and that this wad their company policy. Poor attitude of this management. Avoid this place if you have your grocery shopping with you!!!
2
We have been at Marché in a pretty large group, 8 people. After half an hour in the queue, we decided to split the group to get a table. Inside the restaurant there was a typical swiss atmosphere and that was really nice. The food was ok but nothing special, I had to wait for about 20 mins for my sausage and it was not even that good. I had to look for a fork around the restaurant, yes, there were no forks. It was too expensive for the bad organisation of the staff. I don't think I will eat there again
2
We've been here in a quite large group (8 people). The overall feeling is the place is not well organized: long queue and not good understanding of the request to split the group, missing cutlery, slow preparation of dishes, missing staff. The food may be ok, although my pasta with cream and vegetables had far too much garlic.The price/quality ratio is not very impressive. The beer is very expensive, like other beverages.The design of the place is nice and the atmosphere is nice. You may want to visit the place once to have some fun
4
This Marché is organized like you would find any one of them organized in Switzerland. However their food here is adapted to the taste buds of the Singaporean consumer, but the many different dishes are just as tasty and enjoyable. I enjoy walking around and debating with me what looks good and might enrich my taste at this time. Their decorations and wooden paneling are directly imported from the Swiss Alps and give a homey feeling. Enjoy

We spent two nights in Singapore on Orchard Road and had some difficulty on the first evening finding a good reasonably priced restaurant. On the second morning we discovered Marche @ 313 Somerset. Although the restaurant wasn't open we bought some baked goods at the bakery stand, and they allowed us to take the food inside to eat. While we were eating the downstairs restaurant opened and we were surprised to see how it worked.The restaurant has multiple food stations supplying various kinds of food and drink ( a la Marche, I guess). The diner (or breakfaster) having been seated is free to select food from any or all of the food stations, self service style, with the purchases recorded on a "credit card" which each diner receives on arrival. At the end of the meal you pay at the exit for all food that has been charged to your cards. This, for us, was a novel experience which we hugely enjoyed when we returned in the evening for dinner.The food is excellent cafeteria style food of all kinds in what is supposed to be a Swiss Alpine Village atmosphere. We thoroughly enjoyed it and will happily go to the restaurant again.Some of the scores for ambience and service have been reduced because it is essentially a self service family restaurant. There is plenty of family conversation and laughter. But it isn't romantic and it would depend on what kind of special occassion you are celebrating

Actually came across this restaurant by accident. On the top level was a very appealing bakery with some lovely freshly baked goodies. There was a lady handing out leaflets for 'todays special', so we grabbed one and had a look. You walked down a flight of stairs (it reminded me of entering into a cave). There were several lunch time meals for 8.90 (S) and that came with a homemade drink. The husband opted for one of the specials a delightful chicken/pasta dish. I tasted it and it was delicious, the sauce was beautiful. I had a sweet tooth this day and chose a crepe with mascarpone, strawberries and vanilla ice-cream. Very fresh and filling. Home made lemonade drink accompanied it. (only complaint the drink was not cold). We ventured here several times whilst staying in Singapore and each time the meal was beautiful. Must mention the chicken with mashed potato (so creamy and smooth) with sauce. A must. The restaurant is set up in a unique fashion. You are given a card (like a credit card) on arrival. When you order food you hand over your card and at the end of it - hand the card back and pay for your meal. There are different areas that you can order food from. Salad bar, sweets section, meats, fish, pizzas, savoury crepes, potatoes plus more. A must for anyone wanting good food, friendly staff and a great atmosphere.!!
4
Very interesting concept and the food was pretty good too. Fun and good meal. The nice thing was the diversity of food and atmosphere.
5
Excellent spread of food. Enjoyed the live counters and Sangria. Loved the Salmon, sausages, Risoti, Pizzas, garic bread and roast chicken. Highly recommended for anyone traveling to Singapore
4
Food is delicious and staff are quite accommodating. Would love to go back for more... Prices are above the average but still affordable.
5
Food just... ... YUMMY!! Easy access from Somerset MRT station... 7 of us had great eating experience!!
4
Marche's take-away bakery section outside the resturant offers one of the best variety of freshly baked breads at reasonable price. We make our stock-up once every two weeks from their impressive selection of breads (sour dough, whole grains, mixed nuts...), sandwiches, bread rolls, fruit pies, tarts, muffins, pastry plus others unexpected and ever changing temptations. Baked fresh daily on the premises, they used healthy and good quality raw ingredients to bake in traditional method for that intense and satisfying taste. Their breads made great homemade sandwiches like no others. As good as any bread that your mom will made for you with love! (except that mom made it for FREE!) All the breads are sold uncut and whole, so you could store them in the freezer for months. Highly recommended for bread lovers, and don't forget to pick up a Parma ham cheese stick to munch on the way home!! Enjoy
2
After hearing so much about this place, I went here for a dinner. Sure, it is quite fancy looking but if someone has enough talent to ruin a simple pizza, then its not worth the money! A good place to take some photos and move on! Would not recommend this place as a food option
5
What a way to relax from the hustle & bustle of Orchard Rd. This hidden restaurant (in a massive basement) is worth a visit for every one. Great buffet style dining concept where you can order what ever you like & most food cooked right in front of you (except the pork knuckles, 6 hours in the oven), however they are delicious!!!!!!! Great selection of European beers on tap & great European decor. $170 for four adults which included a 1.5 litre stein of beer is good value at this unique dining experience
4
The food was great, and the choice was extensive. Prices were very fair too. This place offers foods of various cultural influence, which provides you with an ideal dining option for large groups of varied tastes.I particularly recommend the Swiss style rosti with smoked salmon
5
I have never seen such a restaurant which gives you the feel of like your are in the middle of the market full of choices pizza, pasta, rosti, juices, beverages and much more and you can see what you have ordered being cooked.I had rosti which was nicely prepared and tasted yum. Must visit for everyone. Great ambience. Full points from my side
3
Went to this place with few of my office colleagues. The very purpose of me trying this place to try something different than Indian. I am a vegetarian and tried lot of Indian restaurants in SG. The ambiance was really great and the concept of this place was good. As soon as u enter u will be given a card which u can use in the different stalls available in the place. What ever u buy in different stalls available, the stall guy scratches the card and charge u for that. Finally, you have to pay the total(total from all the stalls which you ordered) money.For vegetarian, you can try plane Rosti. I also tried yummy pastries(Chocolate and strawberry). For my colleagues who were non-veg, they had lot of options. Giving 3 rating as i am a vegetarian :
4
Singapore like many other cities is very very busy.... The city rushes an buzzes along....step into Marche an enjoy relaxing feeling like you walked into another country....always enjoy the rosti's an pork nuckles...love this place....grrrrreat food
4
Food is fresh . Waiting times can be long. I however find the place quite pricey ......but the food is good.
5
Service was poor on Friday night, likelihood due to the long queue. Waited about an hour before getting our table for ten. but food was good. Love the ribeye streak and smoked salmon
3
I've been a few times now and continue to be impressed with the quality to price trade-off. Weekday lunchtimes are especially good as there aren't too many people so waiting times aren't a problem. Good selection of food and the lunch specials are great value.
4
Innovative concept. I liked the fact the open market idea and there was so much freedom in choosing your food. That said, when i inquired how to order given that this was all new to me, my question was met by a very sarcastic answer from a service trainee. She pointed to the bowls and muttered something incomprehensible before looking back at me as if saying how stupid i am. I was very surprised that she actually talked to a customer that way that all I could do was look at her name badge which says she was a trainee. I still think that was no excuse but she definitely ruined the warm and homey concept that marche was trying to project
5
The downstairs restaurant is very child friendly. Near the back of the restaurant there is a small play area which satisfied my 3 and 6 year old whilst we enjoyed our dinner. We had 2 child's menu for 9.90 and 1 main with a salad which totally filled us,as the child combo was actually adult size (rosti with cheese sausage and margarita pizza with large glass of freshly squeezed juice each). The kids loved watching the freshly made rosti which was cooked perfectly. We had the pork knuckle which was pretty tasty with mash in the half size. We were too full to have the nice looking desert there.... So we took home the strawberry slice which was yummo! The total came to $60, not bad for really good fresh food
5
Very nice and surprising restaurant at the basement of 313 Stamford. Surprising? Yes, because downstairs there is in fact a market restaurant, with vegetables, meat, fish, pizza, beverage, deserts and tea & coffee areas from which you can choose your menu for yourself! Stuff is very polite and food has an excellent price-quality rate and is tasty! Fast and healthy are the words for what you can eat at Marche! You should try this restaurant at least once here in Singapore or all over the world, from Canada to some countries from Europe
5
When I entered the restaurant the reception is so small that I could not figure out where would be the restaurant. But once I took the stairs to the basement I saw a different world downstairs. It was a typical market place. They gave a card to each one of us and warned us not to lose it. Basically you swipe your order onto the card and pay when you exit. There are different stands - like the Rosti stall that has guys taking fresh potatoes and making it for you. We had a 'plain rosti'. But for me the best was the fresh orange juice. I could not have enough of it. I would go and ask for a 'small' orange juice and he would give me a huge glass and I would keep asking - are you sure this is small :) And we had Tiramisu for dessert. Nice taste. No wonder its one of the favorite hangout places in Singapore. Must visit!!. Costed 27 dollars for Rosti, couple of fresh juices and dessert
4
I have not eaten at MarchÃ© for quite a while. So when I walk passed it today at lunch time, it's offering a lunch set at $8.90 which includes a main dish & a drink, I just can't pass it.There's a few selections for the lunch set, I chose the Pork collar with rosti & a lemonade. The pork was roasted nicely with a nice crust (i loved!) & it's soft & moist inside! The rosti was tasty but I wished it was more fried.You will be given a card & it will be used to record all your purchases which you pay the total at the cashier. No handling of cash!Overall, the food was cheap & good, and the staff are friendly, and decor is nice
4
The first couple of times I went to 313 Somerset, I walked past Marche after taking a look. It looked like a bakery and sandwich shop (though the sandwiches looked good, that's not what I was looking for). This time I looked around and saw a staircase leading down to the basement. It was a pleasant surprise.... a whole basement filled with food stalls like a Swiss food market. Stalls selling wine, beer and juice, others serving Rosti, Pizza, Crepes, salads, grilled and roasted meats, desserts and more. As you enter they give you a card each that you swipe at each stall and then pay at the cashier when you leave.I had a glass of Linden flower and orange juice, a half Pork Knuckle (Crisp outside, juicy and fatty inside) and a roasted potato.... very filling, and satisfying
5
Great concept. Something new you can introduce to the family. Everything is fresh. Great food selection too. Enjoyed our dining experience!
3
We order rosti, lamb steak, apple pie, orange juice.
Frankly the setting decoration of this restaurant is attractive to us. But after order some of the menu and taste, the taste is only average compares to other restaurant or even food court in singapore.
5
we had a great time and the food was delicious the concept is great.quality of the food is amazing.we had a great time.the drinks like fresh beer,root beer etc are great are also very good.
overall an amazing experience
5
Love shopping in supermarket, pick your own food and have it cooked right away. I love my steak there. Btw i don't like homemade drinks there though. The price is ok comparing to the food quality.
4
Impressive theme that remains consistent all throughout even in the washrooms. :) The queue was long from the entrance to the food stations. The food was really fresh and tasted really good but the service could have been better. Some of the stations were unattended at times. A bit expensive for someone like me but I'd still go back. You get what you pay for. Quality food :)
5
Great market style restaurant. Amazing selection of different 'market stalls' offering very fresh food. Great for families as they have a good range of meals for children which strays away for the traditional chips and nuggets approach. Somewhere that realizes that children are allowed real food. Great play house for the children. The Rosti was very good, great range of German beer, and the calamari, pasta and pizza all good
4
Interesting concept with multiple stations each serving a different type of food. We went for brunch and dinner and were satisfied in both cases. The system lets the little darlings roam free amongst the various options and choose their own without endless moaning at mum and dad - they each have a card that is charged for whatever they select and is paid for on the way out. Food quality was good, potato rosti a favourite and the desserts could have made up the whole meal. Only downside is the discomfort of their control freak mum over their self selected calorie intake. We had fun! Recommended
5
Great Concept.... Amazing food .. had the rosties and the pizza. The rostie was delicious and the sour cream on top made it even more mouth watering. Market style yet so clean and hygenic.The pizza was just a regular Pizza.The desserts were delicious too.. a must visit everytime i go to Singapore or for anyone else who is going to SingaporeGo experience it...
5
The concept is very original (European market) and the food delicious and at a reasonable price. The restaurant recreate a mountain-Swiss environment which gives a good atmosphere. This Marche has more diverse food compare to the Harborfront one. Overall I strongly advise you to go over there to feel like you just spend a day skiing in the Swiss mountains !
3
No trip of mine was complete without a dinner at Marche's in Singapore. Earlier they had a restaurant in Orchard which closed down and they opened a new one at Harborfront. On this trip I found a new one in Somerset and tried it out. The swiss staff seems to have totally disappeared. There is no stir fry vegetables which used to be a delicacy. The vegetables were not fresh, the airconditioning not cold enough. The Rosti still tasted the same but the variety in beer was lacking. Somehow felt letdown down by the total atmosphere
5
The Crepes, Lemonades, Potato dishes, Pizzas....the whole lot were fresh, mouthwatering & tasty....and served in a lively bustling atmosphere making the whole meal a memorable, 'must re- visit' experience!!
4
The rostie as usual was fabulous......The pizza s not worth it..
The tiramisu was amazing.....excellent food but expensive
2
The take away pastry are terrible after 7 pm... not fresh !
This is the 3 rd time I take a panacote which is not french...
Impossible to see a manager to informe thwm that the quality is going down slowly but surely. ...
2
Very nice concept. You get in and receive a card. You then explore different counters where a variety of food is on offer. You pick and choose and ship your card each time, so you accumulate items in your bill and would present the card at the counter when exiting. It's easy and clever.The food on display looks great and varied, from salads to pizza, pasta, steak, fish, lamb, chicken dishes, etc, etc,... However food does not taste to your eye"s expectation; even desserts are so so and not sweet enough. Other food is either a bit tasteless or too heavy,... The only corner I can save is the Swiss food one, an interesting kind of omelette with sausage and some very taste and rich soup (after all, it is a Swiss restaurant). Perhaps a simple steak may also pass the test.It is,however a nice place to go with kids as there is plenty of choice and they have a playground well inside the restaurant, for kids to play while adults finish their meal. Price is relatively cheap, in line with quality of food in general! Finally, it seems that no one would remove your dishes until you finish eating all your courses,.... You need to chase the waiters
3
Nice food here, the crepes, pasta, pizza, paella, etc. They have great desserts too. But the service is getting worse every time we visit, It seems that they are under staffed and over worked, Some of them cannot even communicate in English so we cannot understand them
4
Wonderful ambiance and wonderful food...! You can just relax and eat food at your own pace. We spent almost 3 hours there savoring almost every Swiss delight. An underground restaurant which offers a market place experience. You will be given a card and need to present the card in the counters where you want to buy food. Items are freshly prepared and you can actually see the ingredients being used. A very well decor! A wonderful place to hang out
4
We went to Marche in 313 recently to celebrate a birthday in the group and I was surprised that it wasn't as crowded as the Vivocity outlet. The food variety are the same but somehow I find the ambience different from Vivocity...What is good is that Marche 313 has a children playground in its premises and definitely good for families. We enjoyed the food too, the crepes were of good portions and the salads were great too. My girlfriend particularly liked the mushrooms with potatoes.The beer variety is limited and pricey, but you can always grab fresh juices and soft drinks I guess. If you're looking for a decent dinner place, not so much about drinking, with good desserts, there you have it.Ice creams and cakes and crepes.
4
We went to Marches @ 313 one early evening, after shopping. Ordered a Cappucino and a Classic Rosti. The Cappucino was fabulous and generously sized. The rosti was beautifully made and the sour cream went beautifully with it (i asked for a tiny bit extra of the sour cream, but in-turn soured the servers face, may be she didnt like the fact that I asked for a little more). I just don't agree with the prices for the extra add-ons, find them a tad expensive. However, the next time we went to Marche's at Vivocity next time, average Savoury Crepes, great mixed cheese sauce and such a friendly lady behind the Crepes counter, she made the stuff with love. One nice little touch however, is after you pay the bill, they have those little green candies available to you before you exit. They taste so good, I'd rather eat a little piece off there than buy a tiny jar for almost 10 SGD. Overall a nice experience
4
The underground restaurant operates a card system with food cooked at different counters. There is is little attempt to inform customers about what is cooked where. The service is slow and lackadaisical in the extreme. The underlying attitude seems to be that you should be grateful for what you get. That said the food is good.
4
Marche is almost hidden away, in fact we walked past it many times and had no idea what was downstairs until 'tipped off' by a friend. We have been back many times since and the restaurant is a handy spot at Somerset to escape the shopping crowds for some comfort food. The crepes are always good, as are the rosties and juices. On previous occasions I've also tried the soup and vegetables which make a healthy alternative on Orchard Road. It gets quite busy on weekends, but it is Ochard Road... overall a very handy restaurant to have in your artillery if heading out in the Orchard direction
4
Great set up were you are giving a "charge card" go to a "station" and order whatever you like. Swipe card and all is charged back to an account. Great selection of the freshest food. Music was a bit ordinary, but didn't diminish the experience!!
4
Marche is a little taste of Europe in Singapore. Amazingly popular on weekends for a very good reason - the food here is fresh and there is a wide variety - highly recommended.
4
A good selection of foods, the concept really works well. The quality of produce on offer as well as the excellent selection of wines, speciality beers, quality desserts breads etc truly make this a enjoyable restaurant.
5
The kids area was so awesome, it was hard to extract them for dinner. Very simple and easy to get a huge variety of good quality food. Make sure you book in early (before 6:30pm).
5
We discovered this by accident as we were entering a restaurant nearby but had to wait so on wandering around we came across the stairway which led you downstairs into a culinary world different from what one is used to in Singapore and very reasonable. You would think that with the entry being somewhat hidden away it would miss out on custom but this was not the case as every time we visited it was well patronized but not overcrowded.The configuration of the whole area which is large and the card system allows you to roam around at your leisure and choose without rushing. Very much in the Swiss Theme, when you enter you are handed a swipe card in which you can move through the various serving areas purchasing an item which goes on the swipe card. This includes drinks including a range of wines. Then proceed to the dining areas which are slightly apart from the serving areas.The food ranges across the board from steaks , Rosti all the way through to Pasta and the range of sweets available is also expansive.When you are departing you hand the swipe card in , charges are tallied up and you pay. A seamless system

What happened to one of my favorite restaurant in Singapore?Came here last October after shopping, and was looking forward to another good meal. We usually go to Marche @ Vivo City but this was our 1st visit to Marche @ Somerset.Ordered Pasta & Pizza for the boys, a Savory Crepe for the husband and Spanish Rice for me.. Boy, were we disappointed. The Savory Crepe was ordinary, The pizza was relatively empty, pasta was blend, and Spanish Rice was missing many ingredients and tasteless, the friend calamari was not well coated with batter.Hello! What happened to one of our family's favorite restaurant in Singapore?After this experience, I don't think we will visit Marche anytime soon if ever again.
3
I was with my friend and my bro and we decided to drop by Marche @ 313 Somerset for dinner.I never dropped by Marche before and had heard from others that the food is not bad over there thus I looked forward to it.Being it was a wkend and dinner time,we queued for almost about 20 mins before we got a table.Food wise was not bad but slightly expensive for its value.Ambience was average.Went to the ladies after dinner and for the cubicle I visited, the drainage system was actually spoilt.The cubicles were occupied and there were not a lot of cubicles and I was very urgent if I did not recall wrongly.the water was not really up to the brim but little did I expect that after I flushed ,the water actually over flowed and came out and I was disgusted.It seems like the staff were not alerted.They should hv put an out of order sign.I don't know what you guys think but it really kills the trip upon visiting such a rest room after a nice meal like that.Imagine visiting the ladies before dinner,it will really kills your appetite.i feel that checking on the toilot to make sure it is well maintained or everything is working well is part of service especially at a Posh Swiss cafe like Marche as usually dinners will visit the rest room before or after meals to wash their hands.All in all the whole dinning experience was good but could be improved
4
This is my first Swiss dinner. Everything is so fresh and natural. Love the salad and vege very much. A lot of dish for you to chose of, don't worry about that. But pork knuckle are not recommended by me. Not well handled. Salad is a must try!!!
5
We ate here everyday while on our vac. to SP. Found this after getting off Somerset MRT. Wonderful for any meal but we loved breakfast. It doesn't start till 10am but what a great place to go where everyone...picky 10 yr olds, can find what they want. I found the prices in line with SP and US pricing. Fresh, good food so didn't mind paying
3
very busy and very crowded in here. More vegetarian options would be very much appreciated. It seems like the concept would allow for quick service, but some counters have a very long queue, and therefore you miss out on actual dining and enjoying with your fellow guests. Food on the whole is very fresh and of good quality
4
I was in a four-day vacay in SG and my friend took me here. Ever-famous Rosti was great --- reasonable price too! Great atmosphere --- has an old European market feel. :)
4
Very nice concept, good variety of food, and well executed. The rosti is the star of the show, while the meats aren't the greatest. Desserts are a bit pricey, but the overall meal is not bad for Singapore pricing standards.
5
Freshly baked bread and rolls at the bakery - the restaurant below has a variety of freshly prepared food - great pizzas and crepes!
2
I have been there for the first time last month. The food choice are far too many to choice from. Have their grilled seabass set lunch with an apple juice. The fish is very small. Is like the size of my mobile phone. I think the food is overly priced. I would not recommend my friends there
4
Many food courts or restaurants in Singapore tend to be windowless but this makes up for it in the way it has been dressed. Multiple stations with different types of food, a large variety of options to suit all tastes. My only disappointment was not finding the sandwiches nicely displayed upstairs available downstairs in the main restaurant. Overall a nice enjoyable lunch.
4
Marche remains a great place to take the family and/or large groups. Especially now that there are so many dining options in the area, I have started to notice that the crowds are not as big - so you no longer have a long waiting period. The food and service still remain good, and the choices as large. Large groups benefit from a choice of eastern/western meaty/vegetable dishes, so that people can mix and match what they want. Tried the crepe recently; remains succulent
5
we went there for coffee and dessert. at the entrance, they were selling pastries and breads. inside, there were some steps going down to the main area (they also had a lift for persons with disabilities). they had many different food sections, and the decor made us feel as if we were in a european cafeteria. we got some pie and a heavenly butterscotch and strawberry crepe that was cooked and assembled in front of us. everything was excellent.i would have wanted to stay longer to explore the whole place, but we were there very late. i have to say the staff were bright and cheerful even if it was close to midnight
5
This is the second time I have eaten in this place and always, I am very satisfied! I love the wide selection of food and drinks and the cozy Swiss-themed ambiance. The wait was not long, approximately 20 minutes to get a table but I assure you, it is worth the wait
3
Had lunch there with my wife. We had the ever popular Rosti, Chicken Leg, and the soup with bread. The Rosti is as usual dependable. Chicken leg was well marinated and done. Soup was a bit bland though. We finished with a waffle with caramel sauce. The waffle was nice though a bit pricey at $6 a piece
5
In a city that is hard to get a good coffee and with much of the city limited to chains only, it was a nice surprise to find Marche in my wanderings. The coffee is really quite good and much better than Starbucks or Coffee Club and about half the price! If you are staying at a nearby hotel, Marche will be good to grab a takeaway breakfast back to your room; the fresh juice and pastries or toasted rolls are just baked and delicious
5
I don't know about you but the Rostti at Marche never fail to pick me up whenever I'm in a terrible mood. The mushroom soup is to-die-for too. Or if you have a sweet tooth, head for the dessert counter.
4
The overall market-style concept was appealing to my guests and myself and we could choose over a variety of items. It's also fresh and cooked right before your eyes.
4
I am pampered with choices, there are plenty of swiss dishes to begin with. And I like their Rosti with sausage & Australian Root Beer soft drink.
You should give it a try.
5
Didn't know what to expect when my girlfriend took me here to try the food.After arriving, the queue was quite long but the smell from the bakery kept me very interested. As soon as we sat down, the pair of us went to look at the food. Upon returning back to our table, we noticed that someone else had taken it. We told the waiter who quickly found us a new table.The first thing I noticed when browsing the food was the pizza. It looked amazing and I ordered one straight away. I wish I hadn't as everything else looked and smelt even better! Don't make the same mistake I did and make sure to browse about before ordering!Try chicken and beef crepe. Delicious
4
Went for the lunch special at 11am. The restaurant had just opened and we could choose to seat anywhere we wanted. It was quite an experience going through all the stalls and watching the chefs cook the food. Tried the pasta section. It was delicious and costs $9.50 and comes with a drink. We noticed there is a special children's play area for kids. Great place for friends to meet. However, it can get rather crowded during the lunch hour around 1 plus. Glad we were early
3
Went there on a Sunday noon and it was not busy. Lovely setup that can make you feel bit lost. Tried to figure whats what as I needed vegetarian foods but did not find anyone to help explain. After a short struggle I settled for pasta station and asked for specific one. I was assured it will be exactly what i asked for. But it was not. Table seating but tight. Tables too close to others. I think I will go back again with more confidence of how it works. Prices per person was $25 so on the high side for a simple meal and cool drink.
4
Tried their rosti with sour cream and sausage, as recommended by a friend. There was a long queue and I waited for at least five minutes for my order to be given to me. Enjoyed the experience of dining in a marketplace setting and loved the rosti. The place was crowded and quite noisy. They have a small glassed elevator going down to the restaurant but using the stairs is a lot faster. Also tried their pork steak, which was delicious. Total bill for four persons is SGD 95. Also ordered sirloin and fresh orange juice
3
This place is great at luring you in via their abundant food displays. Over here is the german food section, the italian section, a panoply of drinks and luscious desserts on the other side, all arranged in a very eye-catching way. It's a fun way to choose your food, no doubt. But the food itself is a disappointment I think b/c the expectations are so high -- you see this gorgeous display of food and you naturally assume everything will be fresh and tasty. The food was ok, not great, but I suspect they don't use the freshest ingredients and some of the food sits out for a while under the heat lamps waiting to get picked up. When I was there, I stupidly ordered the seafood soup, which to their credit was made in front of me, but they used all frozen seafood. No taste. My friend had a crepe which was a bit better than mine, although honestly...can you really screw up a crepe? On the plus side, the service was great, attentive, and friendly. I suspect they're really family-friendly also. If you go, at least know what you're getting for your money
3
I used to go to Marche quite often in my lunch break - they do lunch deals which are OK as they include a drink and the price is around $8-12, but if you don't have the lunch deal the price can be quite steep these days.Apart from the price, the problem I find with Marche these days is that the menu rarely changes so as a one-off it's quite nice but if you go there regularly, it gets boring very quicklyThe main kinds of food they do are rosti, pork knuckle (very expensive!), pizza (poor - no tomato sauce on the base), seafood (the calamari is usually tough), sausages (nice but expensive), salad bar (watch out for hidden meat in some of the dishes if you are vegetarian), soup (the mushroom is nice), bread (their bread is lovely - they make it themselves), cakes, coffee, wine and bee

Considering that Marche seems to be aiming for the family and younger demographic with their themed restaurant, I thought I would find some more enlightened food options. Yes there were vegetables and salads and protein options however most of these seemed drizzled in butter, or carb-loaded with breads/potatoes etc. In fact if you want to be entertained by the gimmicky animal decor and you LOVE eating various forms of pastry and bread in a kind of open mess hall environment (though with restaurant prices) then this is for you - not however for me. I was staying at the Pan Pacific apartments next door and on a mission to find a local healthy breakfast and lunch option - tried Marche and had to keep looking
