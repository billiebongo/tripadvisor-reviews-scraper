Always came here while we're in Singapore. The food was so amazing, and the sauce was even better. Vegetables, meat, and seafood were so fresh. Our all time favorite.

We have not eaten at COCA for many years and we decided to lunch here with my mother. There is senior citizen pricing at $20++. For adults, it is $27++. What surprises us that the broth was prepared and already placed in the pot without asking you what kind of soup you would like. After enquiring, then they moved the pre-prepared soup to another table and left it there for another customer. Food is fresh for ala carte "buffet" standard, however, the handmade prawn balls were full of msg. the broth also has tastes of msg. The only positive experience we had was the fresh thick fish slices. Will not return again

I have eaten here 2-3 times. It is an all-you-can-eat restaurant with chicken base soup and tom yum soup. Both are great. They also have ala carte menu if you do not want to eat a lot. You can order several times for the food items you like. If the price for dinner on the weekend is too high, try lunch especially on weekdays. Even though there are some items that they don't serve for lunch, but the price is less and they have senior pricing for lunch. Pretty cool for me

I was here for lunch with my friend on my birthday and they have special price if you are a local student! Just flash your student card to the waiter and next just sit down and order your food. Steamboat style with default chicken soup and tom yam. We basically ate for 1hr 30min. Its on the 4th floor on ngee ann city opposite to adidas. We paid total $50.60SGD for two person

Came here for lunch and had the buffet which is really amazing value. Selection and variety available for the buffet is really good. Ingredients were fresh, the vegetables were crisp and fresh too. Coca has the best chili sauce dip with coriander and sesame seed that added extra flavor to the sauce. Very enjoyable.

The Coca steamboat at RWS came with half rich broth chicken soup and Tom Yum soup base so you get to sample the best of both. Ingredients were fresh and aplenty with the buffet lunch of $27/- for adult and $20/- for children. Kids under 4 eat for free! Food quality has kept up to its high standards over the years!

Lunch buffet at 26++ is highly value for money. Love its sweet chili sauce and dumplings /wanton. Free flow of meat and prawns and fish as well. Senior citizen above 60 can dine at 21 ++. This outlet food is fresher than taka one and is usually quite empty. One of my fav family lunch spot
