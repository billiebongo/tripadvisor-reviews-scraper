It's one of the rare feel old restaurants with both steamboat and tze char together. The steamboat is nothing to shout about but the hainanese porkchop and satay was great. Chicken rice was good too. Don't expect first class service but the setting is charming

I grew up in Singapore but went to this restaurant for the first time with friends for dinner. They specialise in steam boat and chicken rice. The steam boat was really good with fresh ingredients and the beef was so tender. Cooked dishes like bittergourd with beef and sweet sour pork were excellent. The pork satay was really delicious as well. We ordered 50 sticks! Don't expect much in terms of ambience as there is none. The venue is truly off the beaten track and in an old shopping centre. Don't get it confused with Golden Mile Complex next door. There is a big sign on the building at the front so you know you've got the right place

We have been patronising this place on a regular bi-weekly basis. For me I felt the experience has gone from a ‘must go to no go’ dinner venue. My disappointment started last month when they replaced my favourite vegetable ‘Tang oh’ with another vegetable. Then to add on to my horror, on another visit they charged $0.50 for red cut chilli. I must say being charged for cut chilli is a first for me. Though not a big sum,I find it weird having to pay for my chilli. The final disappointment was today when they increased the price of the dishes. Guess I need to rethink my regular dinner venue from now on.

The settings, atmosphere, food, are trailed and tested. It remains to be the same since my first visit, which was over 30 years ago. I don't frequent them much but the standard remains whenever I visited, wither intervals of a few years in between.Old school food and setting, always worth a visit

If you think $28 for a whole chicken at Boon Tong Kee is expensive, it is $36 here! We ordered a $12 plate. Personal opinion - it is no where close to Boon Tong Kee's standard. Seriously just ordinary chicken although I must say the rice is pretty good. We didn't do the steamboat. A small portion is $34. Not exactly cheap either. The baby squid at $12 is addictive. Let's say the pork satay 10 sticks at $8 ain't too bad. Last eaten there some 25 years ago. No pull factor to go back again

I like this place, a homely feel with all the noise, just like a happy family having dinner like during festive season. Lunar New Year. The chicken rice is aromatic, oily. Chicken smooth & tender. The pong pong Prawns is our Favourite. My son enjoy their hainanaese porkchop very much. Beef for steamboat is tender. Everything was delicious.

I still remember when I was just a little boy, back in the late 70s, my father brought me to this restaurant. After all these years, never stop going back! This is the best chicken rice in Singapore now, in my humble opinion. Though there's really nothing to shout about for the steamboat, it's still the same old taste after 40 years. It tasted home-cooked style steamboat, not fantastic but satisfying and authentic! They have the best chili and ginger sauce

I have eaten at this restaurant since I came to Singapore some 40 years ago. Visited this outlet again with family and we had a fantastic dinner here . The chicken still taste great and the Hainanese pork chop was still mouth watering . The steam boat has s generous portion of all the ingredients to make it great. All of us had a hearty meal. The crowd is still large and we were served well. Strongly recommended

The business here was quite astonishing. They had huge seating area and it was really widespread! We had steamboat and chicken rice. To say the truth, it wasn't that tasty and it was quite expensive. Their beef steamboat set was $50 and the ingredients were limited. I was quite surprised by the price. Their soup base was quite bland and simple. However, their Kang Kong and Onion Omelette were not bad!

Thien Kee Steamboat at Golden Mile Complex is a must go if you are fond of steamboat! The set meal for their steamboat, paired with their authentic hainanese chicken, will leave you satisfied and quite value for money!

Steamboat is lousy. Chicken not bad but too expensive. Ordered Steamboat and 1 chicken with 5 bottles Heineken for 7 persons and it cost us $195. Lousy food and not worth.

Visited this old school hainanese steamboat outlet with frens. This place only accept cash. The restaurant was packed with families enjoying dinner & some group celebrating birthdays. Some company brought their oversea guest too.

Have been patronising the shop on and off. Went last Sunday early evening and the place was full, service staff was not helpful at all and asked us (party of 8, with toddlers and elderly) to locate a table on our own. Regular patrons appreciate the hospitality of traditional shops but this shop has forgotten its roots when business is brisk. Disappointing. The steamboat is nothing to wow about though the tender boiled chicken and pork satay were what my parents like. Would not return again, unless parents initiate so in future

Definitely my favourite place to go for authentic Hainanese Chicken Rice in Singapore.Thien Kee Steamboat is located at the basement of Golden Mile Complex. This place is popular with the locals and regulars who crave for authentic and traditional Hainanese dishes.Popular dishes include the steamboat (must order the cockles and beef) , Hainanese Chicken Rice, Hainanese Pork Chop, Chives, etc..Thien Kee is my choice over the overly commercialized Boon Tong Kee, Tian Tian, etc... Value for Money

I grew up eating here as my parents would frequently take the family here for meals. It was our Favourite steamboat restaurant. However, as their popularity continued to surge, the price has continued to increase with standard of food quality decreasing. We like to enjoy our steamboat here with their signature chicken rice. We normally order a set and an extra plate of cockles for our family of 4. During my last visit, the bill was $69. It is indeed getting overpriced.

The quality and service of this place have dropped over the years. Usually no receipt given also and wonder how they declare their tax. I eat in this restaurant since primary school with my parents but probably this is my last trip here. Food is expensive and not tasty anymore other than their satay. Satay is cold but still tasty

An old ( more than 50 years establishment) Hainanese restaurant that famous for it chicken rice and steamboat. It already 22 years since my first visit. The price is quite reasonable and authentic, beside their Hainanese chicken rice and steamboat that die die must try, do try out their satay, porkchop and my new love - deep fried baby squid too. For first timer may have some difficulties locate the restaurant it located at the basement and quite corner of the building, furthermore iit quite far from MRT train station and limited bus no going pass the place, hence taken a cab is the best alternative, maybe more practical, however if you take a train, you may wish to ask around where is Golden Mile Tower and I believe the folks will able to guide you to the place. Seating is not an issue for this restaurant as it has more than 40 tables and their services are quite fast, hence the waiting time is quite short. Please note that the payment mode is only Cash term. Please make sure you have sufficient cash to foot the bill. FYI, No GST or service charges for this restaurant which I like it. If I have any foregin Friends who visiting Singapore, I always bring them to this restaurant to taste what we called local food. Trust me! They definitely will love it.Do give me a helpful vote if my review will able to help yo

We are here for a birthday celebration. All of us love their chicken rice! Not sure, if we are too hungry or its simply too yummy, we ordered 3 plates of pork satays...one thing you just need ensure that the satay is more cooked so it will be nicer.The stream boat price goes by per set. It's not buffet style where there are unlimited of food. You need to tell them how many pax are eating and they will advise you what to order according. If i remembered correctly, the small size is $50, medium size is $65 and large will be $75. You can order side order like beef only etc

There were 7 of us. We paid about $110 including steamboat, chicken rice and drinks. That's value for money. I like the chicken rice because the rice was steamed right and it was infused with the aroma and flavor of real chicken stock and ginger. Cooked meat from steamboat including beef, pork, pork liver, chicken and prawn dipped in chicken rice chilli was definitely a winner for the palate. A good combination eating chicken rice accompanied with steamboat. The restaurant setup is old fashioned and gives a nostalgic feeling. There is air conditioning so it's comfortable. Good place to invite overseas visitors for local food. They don't accept credit cards so please have enough cash with you
