Nice dinner with the family after trip in Singapore. A lot of different choices. Good and nice quality.
3
Freshly served salmon sashimi yet not much of option other than sushi available on it.
Soup is served separately ordering from them services is just normal as mostly everything is self-services
4
First time eat here after visit merlion patk an esplanade. Their Sushi is very cheap. All item SGD1,5. You can make hot ocha for free.
1
recent visit to the outlet at Hillion Mall. Was surprised many items were sold out. Tuna sashimi, tako wasabi, etc. The lid cover for the sushi are extremely grossed to served when they are filled with fingerprints and oily. Not to mention, service was bad too
4
This restaurant offers a pretty satisfactory express Japanese craving be it sushi or sashimi. Sit somewhere at the start of the menu belt to be able to choose what you like straight from the kitchen. I didn't notice tempura tho- and can ask for more of a kind if limited or none is offered on the belt.Waiters seem to be too pre occupied too to come back to you in time of your hunger if requesting for other menu or additional soup. Not typical for families with small children
3
Came back here again this week for a quick lunch: 8 plates of sushi and a miso soup for around $16 total. Very reasonable prices but the sushi is quite mediocre. Also a bit tricky to get salmon sushi on this visit, even after a few requests. It's ok when you're in a rush but manage your expectations
4
If you have cravings for sushi, sashimi and maki, this may be a good alternative for you. I tried their branch in Heartland Mall, which just opened a couple of months back. Concept is that customers sit by a long bar while the various makis/sushis are placed on pink plastic saucers traveling on a long conveyor belt in front of you. You simply take from the conveyor the food that you want. This is called kaitenzushi.Frankly, I've tasted better sushi and maki, but this place is not bad at all. Service is quite good. Waiters are attentive and ready to assist quickly. Prices are not bad at $1.50 per saucer. Due to the daily long queues, customers are given a time limit of 45 mins only for dining. Their miso soup is not the best but it is acceptable. A hungry person can probably consume 8-10 saucers and that translates to about $15-18 for your meal including the soup and hot tea. Great idea of selling food.
4
This place is good for those just taking their first steps into eating sushi, you get to see what going round on the conveyor belt, so you can pick and choose those that suit your fancy. It is also cheap and a good introduction to sushi. You cannot go wrong at this place. Free japanese tea, towle, wasahi and pickled ginger
2
Visited this place place to try out the concept. Good for those who need to rush back to office to work. Dont like the sitting arrangement. No place to put down your bag and you are given half an hour to eat. Waiting for the salmon but it didnt show up
3
Every plate of sushi is @$1.50, For that Price you cannot complaint about the food quality.Of course you would not expect them to serve airflown Ootoro and Chutoro.I would recommend its Aburi Sushi which still give off the nice taste/smell of the Grill sushi.Service is ok. easily accessible at its various location
4
I tend to be suspicious of these conveyor type sushi restaurants. I worry that the food goes around the conveyor too often and is not fresh enough. But this was good & quick & cheap.
5
Fast service and great tasting sushi, perfect for a quick bite in between shopping. Great salmon sashimi
4
This is an efficient place to eat. Service is friendly, food is good and there is always a space for you.
5
At 1.50sgd per plate, who would complain?? One of the well worth it meals I've had in their malls. Picking your plate from the conveyor belt is a novelty that will never fade. If there's a place I will want to visit again, this will be one of them :
5
Loved the raw glass shrimp, raw hotate and grilled cheese mussels!! Need to order though for the raw hotate, then the staff will make if fresh :) it's 1.5 SGD per plate, cheaper than other places in malaysia (cant really find fresh glass shrimp in malaysia too with that price).
4
Another outlet has spranked at Tampines Central.Sweet ebi sushi at $1.50 is placed nonstop on the conveyor belt. It is fresh and is usually charged $6 for 2 pieces by its competitors .... a extremely value for money. Its salmon sashimi is slow in coming out onto the conveyor belt .... I wonder whether it is trying to control quick consumption or the chef is trying to cope with the demand. Varieties of sushi are also offered.Never miss its cheese cake ... soft and creamy. Others offer it at $3.90. Lots of other cakes are also presented.Tea and ginger are complimentary.... a very good gesture from the owner
3
if you are looking for a quick fix for your sushi craving, this is the place to be. The price and the taste is what you get. The taste is actually decent considering the price SGD1.50 per plate. I am a fan of Japanese food and tend to be meticulous when it comes to the look and taste. But this is a place that I always go back to when Im in a hurry, and in a budget. :
4
We stepped in at 945pm and were allowed to have our dinner. They close at 10pm so great service there. There were still a lot of sushi on the conveyer belt (not sure if its a good thing). But whatever we had was fresh and there lots of decent options even at 945pm. What surprised me was the bill. It was very very affordable. So if you are looking at having sushi on a buffet and eating copious amounts, definitely drop by. Quality is decent
3
Always need to wait for empty seats every time we come here. The sushi portion are all small. You can start eating by grabbing plates with sushi from the conveyor belt. The waiter will count the plate after finish and want to pay. Price is great, but the taste is also so-so
3
This place can get really busy in the evenings but on a wet weekday lunchtime there's no queue at all and you can get a decent feed of sushi in at relatively low cost. Quality isn't great but then the price is only $1.50++ a plate so you can't be too unreasonable with expectations. Good in emergency situations when you don't want to go out in the open
4
Reasonable price n fresh sushi..place to go when u feel like taking fresh n not so ex sushi , variety not as much as what u would get to eat at Sakae Sushi or Sushi Tei but sufficient enough to stop your craving.
2
The sushi or negiri you get are quite similar to what you get at the supermarkets. Not entirely terrible but not the sort you bring a date to or if you really had a hankering for proper Japanese food. Everything goes around on the conveyor belt, you pick out what you want, eat and go. It's a high turn around place with zero consideration for anything else. We tried asking the waiters for the ebiko sushi, the first time round, we didn't know why the order never came. The second time round, we watched as the waitress just took our order, acknowledged it, went to clear a table, talk to her colleague and completely forget about the order. We tried again for the third time, this time asked another waiter for the ebiko sushi and he did the exact same thing! He walked around, went to the counter and hung around there. I don't know if they were not meant to take orders or something but it was quite puzzling but I did think we were never going to get our order so having already waited, we paid up and went somewhere else to complete our lunch. Their loss I guess.I wouldn't recommend this place unless it was going to be a quick lunch just to fill you up. If you wanted to sit down, have a proper meal, this is not the place and you would do well to go elsewhere
4
You will be wowed on our S'pore's version of 100yen sushi at the basement of Somerset 313 when you get out of Somerset station.At S$1.50 you will be pleased with a pair of sushi or 3 pieces of sashimi of your choice fresh and satisfying. Ginger wasabi soy sauce and even orcha is ON the house Desserts like blueberry cheesecake, mini cream puff, pudding, lemon tea bottle is at S$1.50 Surgoi n arigato gozaimasu
3
The price tag is so tempting- all items at sgd 1.50 each. Gst will Be added into the final bill.he salmon sashimi pieces were cut small. You have to take many plates to form one proper serving. The miso soup is so comforting especially on a cold and rainy date. It came pipping hot, not salty and has pieces of boiled salmon in it.
5
Very good value, cheap price but good quality.Suitable for a quick lunch alonr or with friends.Tried other sushi express shops but this one is always the best (maybe because of my 1st time in this shop).Wish that they don't have time limit for each table since we always get only 30mins
4
For us, it was an interesting experience. Food passes over a small conveyor belt. You just pick the ones which you like. At the end, the waiter comes and counts the plates you finish and you pay bill at cashier. The per plate was like 1.5 SGD ++. It was good. Food was tasty. A nice way to taste different kinds of Japanese food. Lots of crowd. We had to wait in the queue for 15 minutes. A bit noisy
5
Be prepared to enjoy the best of Japanese sushi. Don't go towards the end of the day and select a place, near to the chef's table so you don't need to wait, but otherwise you need to wait. Everything comes on the conveyor belt from Ginger to wasabi paste packets and also put your covers back on the conveyor. Others before us were grabbing and not allowing it to come further. But the food was brilliant and we havnt experienced the various sushi's, maki's and sashimi's which we thoroughly enjoyed each and everyone. You help yourselves with Green tea which is kept for you. But the hot water pipes are available on the table itself
2
Went with my family for the first time as I was wondering why this restaurant is always busy during meal periods.When you step in, you don't get to choose where you sit, it's their company policy to sit you immediately beside an empty seat just like a queue line.I was there at 1pm with my family and the restaurant had about 15 customers but the entire conveyor belt was filled with food which looks good BUT doesn't that mean that the food will be in ambient environment for a long time which is a food hazard?We took the food as it passes us and true enough, the food was not cold nor hot and who knows how Long the food has been kept that way.The food doesn't taste fresh at all and I'm surprised the local health authority allows this unsafe food practice to continue and that was when my wife told me that she heard of some food poisoning case in this chain before.I guess the owner haven't learnt his lesson
4
Quite a cheap sushi place for SG standards. Nice conveyor belt with a bit of variety, also cheap desserts that are on the belt as well. A lot of nigiris, which are my personal favorite. Also, let's not forget free tea. Very good for the price, but I wouldn't come here if I had more money to spend on lunch, not super special :
3
Visited the citilink branch in June2016, one of many branches in Singapore. Decent quality sushi and price not too high with this standard, S$1.5 every dishes, valuable in Singapore. Service was fast, with limited time to dine in ~90 mins?(not sure). Its standard is similar to Sushi belt in Japan, self service for hot tea at your front, shoyu, wasabi, pickle ginger as well. Good choice for Japanese sushi with limited budget
4
No frills place to eat. Sushi is cheap and okay quality.
The manager was pretty decent even though at the late hour, theres still many diners.
Theres a 10% service charge and 7% gst
5
Lunch was good. Great variety of selection. Staff was helpful and efficient with service. The cooked sushis tastes really good. Trust me when I say it is both delicious and easy on the wallet.
4
Fun atmosphere, just sit and enjoy - no rush no hassle.
We really enjoyed and will be back during this trip!
+ Friendly staff and good service.
+ Good value for the money
+ Good selection
4
You cannot raise your expectations too high. This is a sushi on a belt train joint by a Taiwanese brand with staff from Malaysia and Philippines, selling Japanese food.On some days the fish is cut deep and thick. On other days, size is smaller, reduced. Market forces perhaps. But the price is cheap. Can easily devour 10plates by myself. Hot tea is free and unlimited. So if nothing comes your way, you can always quench your thirst for free. Service is so-so. When the tide is high, service lacks. I guess that is the norm.Cheap food. Eat and go. Don't need to linger
4
standardised operations, its not done to order, so what you see on the belt is what its available. went to the tampines outlet, albeit the long Q, service was prompt. its very much self service, during the entire dining process. you only get the service staff to tabulate the no. of plates. quality : price ratio seems rather ok to me, my personal favourites are salmon aburi, long salmon belly (just one piece on the plate) and the boiled shrimps! -tampines one outlet
5
At $1.50 a plate, the sushi here is pretty fresh and good. With a conveyor belt concept, you simply wait for your desired sushi to come your way. At times, they even have uni (sea urchin) sushi; one of the cheapest you can get in Singapore
3
Amongst the few outlets throughout Singapore, I dare say that city link outlet prove that serve one of the most diverse and variety set of dishes (even out shinning the outlet at somerset313).However as all sushi express outlet conveyor belt system. They all suffer the same issue of customer positioning. At certain "post choke points" where there are a bundle of "hungry" customers upstream, one may not be able to get the prized grilled salmon sushi. And I assure you, it will not survive one or even half a revolution. It might be better for management to take that into account and plan the seat better, or even the conveyor belt pathing
3
Ate at the outlet at bedok point. Had to queue and was given a time limit to eat. The sushi belt was rather enjoyable and the sushi is not bad however the choices were limited. Managed to eat the cooked ones as my table was near the kitchen. Although the sushi is cheap there is GST and service charge
4
I walk passed this outlet a few days ago and amazed by the numbers of people standing outside for Q. When I got back home and did some research and found out that there's outlet near home @Somerset 313.Today I popped up around 4.45 p.m. It doesn't have any Q at all till the time I finished. No time limit for this branch. What I ate :X2 of Salmon Sashimi which was good. It was fresh and not dried out. X1 Grill Salmon Sushi which was good. It was fresh and not dried out. X1 Glass Shrimp sushi which wasn't so good. The shrimps wasn't firm and not sweet. Skip this one. X1 Raw Scallops was quite good. Nice smell and juicy. X1 Seaweed Salad was nice. Right texture and taste. X1 Urchin sushi wasn't so good. It was a little old. Skip this one. X5 Amaebi sushi was excellent. This plate is my hilight hilight. It's only 1 sushi rice under 5 pieces of sweet shrimps. Normally I made special trip to Mediya Japanese Supermarket down by Liang Court to bought 12 pieces of this for 19$. This plate is super value for money to me. Total 12 dishes for 21.19S$ was incredibly cheap. Free green tea bags in front of me. The service was decent. Most of dishes came out same time. For Amaebi Sushi I wait nearly 40 mins to get the last 4 plates. Definitely better variety and quality than Sakae Sushi plus 35% cheaper.
5
We went to their 313 Somerset location; it is a sushi belt-bar type of place. The sushi is delicious, and each plate only costs $1.50, which is the cheapest in Singapore. Many options to choose from, so this is perfect for friends or families. Their apple pies are great too
5
Good price, location, variety of sushi, efficient service from crew member and also a free drink after bill.
4
Near Conrad Hotel great value for money for all sushi lovers at reasonable prices and great selection
4
Had this at their 313@Somerset branch for a quick dinner, and was not disappointed. There was a queue when we went, but the line moved quickly, and we were inside in under five minutes. Had mostly salmon (sushi, sashimi, and seared), as well as their yellowfin tuna sushi. All were nice and fresh, and more than what I expected for the price. They also have cakes and desserts, and salads and veggies going around on the conveyor belt, but I didn't try any of those. A lovely experience all in all.
4
Don't expect high quality sushi and you're less likely to be disappointed. If you target the salmon sashimi, the prawn sushi and the edamame you're also likely to have a better experience. I found most of the rest to be not so good. But hey at this price it's hard to complain. Acceptable value at this price point
1
Went today to the Westgate outlet. Kind of late, few patrons. As I seat, a waiter brings 3 plates of sushi to a couple sitting next to me. Since there was no salmon on the belt, i ask a waiter to bring me two plates. When she returns, she tells me i have to wait since the chef went out to lunch. A few minutes later she comes empty handed and tells me she can not serve me on the counter. When i tell her the couple sitting next to me had been served earlier she says not possible. Calling me a liar???Thats when i stand, pay my lonely consumed plate of sushi and leave, never to return...Manager tells me they do not serve unless they feel like serving.Chris Ng is supposed to be in charge of operations at 6298 2947. Suggest he patronizes the place once a while..
3
This restaurant is located in one of Singapore's many underground passages. It's not the most fancy place but it's neat and clean as someone can expect from a restaurant.Lots of people visit this sushi place and especially in the evening there might be a queue.I visited this restaurant approx 10 times during the last 18months as it has really reasonable prices. Each plate costs S$1,5. However be prepared to be charged for an additional service tax of 10% and another GST tax of 7%. Most dishes are not outstanding but yet correct. Most liked are their tuna sashimi. Many dishes come with a sauce that is unfortunately overruling hence the original taste is ruined. The weakest point to me are their salmon sashimi. The texture is too tough which makes repeated chewing necessary. Also it's very greasy.Staff is very helpful as you would expect in a sushi restaurant. When they assign you a place try to get one close to the chefs so you can benefit from the new things on the conveyer belt. If you're at the wrong side it might take a while before some dished get to you. However you can always ask the staff for some dishes if it'd take too lon
2
Come here for dinner with my son.Initially seems quite fun as he can grab direct from sushi belt and enjoy. But later find dissapointment as the menu most is raw sushi and not suitable for kid. The cooked one very2 slow to appear.The only good thing is the price which is very cheap
3
Had dinner there and this was our 3rd visit to this rather interesting place. All plates are priced at $1.50 so its a don't expect too much of it.The sushi.....well, is assembled since we did see the rice all come in a tray and a grumpy old dude was just assembling them before putting them on the conveyor belt. We tried ordering off the menu but we just saw the poor waitress rudely being waved off by the grumpy old dude who was assembling the sushi. I guess that was the mistake we made that day cos while waiting for our orders, we forgot about the 50 minute time limit you have here. This isn't the place you dine out with friends and have a chat, this is the sort of place you shovel down the food, pay and get lost. It helps to keep that in mind if you're hungry and want a proper meal!Quality of the sushi was alright, no complaints there. Its quite comparable to supermarket sushi but cheaper, which explains the queue. Yes, a queue here is usually an attempt to entice passing shoppers to check the place out and be noticed. While most other places fail miserably, this place's sole saving grace is the decent quality for low prices
1
it was our second time to eat at sushi express (after a good experience)but this time the quality went down. sashimi tasted so artificial and definitely far from fresh (almost like washcloth tasting). sushi variety was so-so. during the 1 hour dining limit, we just managed to consume 5 plates in total, with the hopes of finding something that would satisfy our taste buds. even the miso soup ended up half eaten. it would be better to spend your money elsewhere
3
as always there is a long q outside...sushi n sashimi are cheap but u gotta eat fast if u have a big appetite as there is a time limit...shortest i encountered so far was 45mins at NEX. its not a buffet so setting time limit is pretty ridicules but cos of the long q this is the only way to prevent hogging of seats and not eating
4
This is the place to go if you just want to stuff your face silly with loads of sushi at a reasonable cost. Quality is at the very east average and it all tastes ok.
4
We tried them all, sushi express has best deal, great salmon, kids loved it. No drinks, just free tea and hot water.
4
Conveyor belt type of restaurant. Serve fresh delicious and affordable Japanese Sushi and food. Unique food preparation that is appetizing and good.
3
We have tried almost every kind of sushi place in Singapore. The only difference is at Sushi Express there was no such thing as coloured plate . Every plate was charged at a standardised S$1.50 each which really speeds up computation of your bill. Food is average.There is no menu in this restaurant, just get what you want from the conveyor belt that goes around the restaurant passing through all the tables. Its a cheap sushi place so it gets crowded during weekends. You can also do take out sushi meals
4
First of all, I'd like to highlight the quality of the food. For the price, I'm safe to say that this place will certainly satisfy those who crave for sushi without putting a hole in your wallet/purse. It is certainly not bad for those who are opting for a quick bite or for those who are in rush for a meal because you would still to be able to enjoy the food there as well as the free green tea provided. Thumbs up for that.Moving on to the service provided by the working staff, there's nothing much to be commented because the food is served by ourselves by taking the sushi platter from the moving belt. I observed most of them are occupied with keeping the plates and covers clean.Last but not least, the environment is fine. Enjoy your wasabi :
4
The food is very nice and the price is also quit good. I came to sushi express a few times already but the only thing always is that a cup (for the tea) is dirty. Many things are dirty so i suggest they have to clean better. But as said i like it there and could also recomend it
4
As mentioned by others, its 1.50 per plate, or 1.76 all in, choose as the food passes in front of you via the conveyor. Only the tea in front of you and the radish on the conveyor is complimentary. Even though it looks like there were a lot of choices, its not. Sashimi is limited, and we ended up getting mostly salmon sashimi. No tuna. Even the maki, limited choices. Most of us in our group ate an average of 5-6 plates. But one in our group came with hungry, and ended up grabbing 18 plates. The price for 18 plates is like eating in a japanese resto eat all you can! And to think the salmon sashimi plate only had 2 slices, not good for the very hungry. Eat all you can radish, anyone
4
I just passed by this restaurant and get interested to try. And in love the sushi! All price of foods are 1.5$SGD and we just need to sit and wait the foods to come by theirself to our table. The service not fast and little bit dissapointing because the place is crowded, lot of peopl
4
It's hard to stop eating when you seat down in front of the sushi belt. The quality is inequal depending on the product but after a few times, you know what is good and you can really enjoy a delicious meal for a good value! The Miso soup, filled with the salmon leftovers of the sushi cutting is very very good!! Don't hesitate
4
A meal + 1 drink at a food court nowadays easily set u back S$7-10, higher if u choose some lunch sets like jap/korean/pepper lunch, etc... Sushi express lets u pick the sushi/sashimi at S$1.50++, which is $1.76 nett per plate , any plate... They do not confuse you with different colored plates that fetch different prices. And they let u have free green tea, help yourself to all the ginger/wasabi u can consume. They offer as well, at S$1.50++, Miso soup that has salmon in it.... On my previous visits it tasted fantastic, but on subsequent visits I found the soup heavy in oil n lacking in miso taste... Guess the management seeing how to cut costs or had a change of supply to 'cheaper but fatter'-salmon? Hope they revert to the original recipe and quality.
4
I´ve been here many times and keep coming back.. good sushi in affordable price. Can recommend this one. :)
3
Sushi price is $1.50++ and of course it use to be a nice and lots of variety but nowadays it's lesser and their service is very bad. I will still recommend for the price but not their service.
3
We used to frequent sushi express since 3 years ago. We had good experience before but recent visits has been disappointing despite it being $1.50 per plate. Not much variety of sushi served and we ended up eating mostly the same thing - normal salmon sushi
5
This is a great Japanese restaurant you can walk in and serves awesome sushi on trays in a conveyor. The plates keep passing by you choose from sashimi, Nigiri,gunkan, maki and desserts. Each plate costs SGD 1.5 eat as much as you want the waitress will count the plates and you simply pay for it. The food was awesome and wasabi,ginger,wet tissue and Japanese tea is complimentary. Note they do charge for service fee and get so expect a bit more to pay when you bill from number of plates * 1.5.Will highly recommend it as food and ambience is great
3
Sushi freshness is guarantee as I seen the chef throwing plates away which are on the train for a long time. Price at 1.50 per plate its definitely low price. Free flow green tea and wasabi, quite a good deal. The place can get crowded pretty fast so do come earl
5
we have visited this place 5 times over the past 3 years. And it gets better with each visit. The first time we were disappointed with the selection but then we excused it because we were there at an "off-peak" time of the day. The last two visits were early evening (dinner time) and the selection was fabulous. Salmon (our favorite) was plentiful, generous in portions and fresh. They even had one of the best choc cakes I have ever had! The miso soup is full of chunks of salmon. Each plate is only $1.50 ++ it is is worth it! I love that you can help yourself to tea at your seat with the hot water taps at each station. Service was very good our last two visits - they even accommodated our requests. During peak times there is a 50min dining limit which is fair enough. Kids love this place also - i would highly recommend this place
3
Tried this local favorite sushi-train establishment at their 313 Somerset outlet located at Basement 3.Decor was young modern & clientele went the same way.I wouldn't suggest their Bah-Hu Sushi, they loaded it with a third pork floss making each bite a dry-desert-mouth experience not worth repeating.The rest of the items are relatively fresh albeit hurriedly prepared (visually plating is not great) and business is brisk especially with younger crowd.Guess their $1.50 per plate concept is a hot favorite for just that quick cheap bite
4
We were lucky enough to spot no queue at this popular sushi chain during a Friday early evening and decided to pop by for a try!Each plate cost $1.50 and if i'm not wrong, there's no GST and service charge as well!Wet towels are not charged too!Most of the sushi apppears to be of raw fish, good for those who love them. Other than that, it's pretty limited. They also have sashimi slices, 3 for $1.50.Do give it a try if you are around the vicinity and there's no queue.More here:http://www.thejewelsthatdance.blogspot.sg/2015/02/sushi-express-citylink-review.htm

Interesting place...sushi on a carousel! You sit down and a carousel of a variety of sushi, seaweed, edamame, and desert comes by for your selection. Tea is included. You are charged $1.50 for each plate you select. My wife and I paid $26,45 total for our dinner. Amazing price for Singapore considering we just paid over $250 the night before. Not the very best sushi but okay for the price, what do you expect for $1.50
4
All sushi $1.5++, nice and fresh , the best price sushi in town . but dun expect the service and base on the location you sit . Many type of sushi and some session fresh food . Must try the smoke salmon and sweet Yam. After 845pm try not to go as they are start doing cleaning, and the choice of food are cut down 80%, keep seeing the same food over and over .
2
The queue is very long but the food is cheep and good.
Those who are thinking about eating
1.you only have 40 min to eat
2.the queue is very long
3.the food is average
:) enjoy eating your food-chester reviews
4
at $1.50 per plate, nothing much could go wrong. you could take as much plate as you like and total bill will still be cheap and you feeling very full.
4
Sushi were good and i only spent 1.50$s for one. But there were not many kinds of sushi and dessert for us to choice
4
A great place for affordable sushi and free flow green tea. The sashimi cuts aren't too great, but for the prices, $1.50 per plate, it's not all bad. If you can't wait for your plate on the conveyor belt, ask it directly from their wait staff
4
This is a very busy chain of restaurants. Invariably there is queue around lunch & dinner time but it is worth the wait. A nice place to get introduced to the Japanese cuisine. Pick up what ever you fancy from the conveyor & enjoy it with the wasabi & soy sauce dip.
3
I have been to Sushi Express twice since my last review. Unfortunately, I have seen a significant drop in the standard of sushi. It is still the same price, and still better than direct competitors, the queues are still there.What has changed? The decent fish slices have gone.... replaced by fish slices no larger than what you get at supermarkets. This goes for both sashimi and sushi. Not impressed - cutting corners, which they really don't need to do ... Be aware
2
I used to eat at least once a week at Sushi Express, both in Citilink and in 313 Somerset. For a sushi lover, it's like a jackpot to have a cheap and yummy sushi chain nearby my house. But then their quality of the salmon and their service was starting to decline. At first I just ignored the bad service. I thought, whatever, as long as I got a $1.5 sashimi.It got worse and worse when I realize their sashimi is not the same I tasted long time ago. I wasn't even sure if it was even a graded salmon. It's probably the worst grade or something because the salmon doesn't taste good anymore.I got more disappointed than before everytime I come. I realize the customer is getting lesser and lesser. I used to queue for at least 30 mins but now I didn't even queue anymore (not that I complain about it) but anyway, yesterday I had my (probably) last meal at Sushi express. It was so disappointing, and I had to say farewell to my favorite sushi place. :"
3
This time I tried the outlet in the Citylink Mall. Sushi quality was better than on my last visit to the other outlet in Somerset. Service wasn't really so friendly, but was certainly efficient. Weekday lunchtime at about 1pm there was no queue and we were able to get a table for 3 without a challenge. Prices are surprisingly low at $1.50++ per plate. We were in and out within 40 mins, so definitely a good options when you need something fast for lunch
4
They have most types of sushi..My fave here are the squid,californian roll n custard..All small plates with sushis on top are sliding around the resto..you pick whatever tempting you when they come in front of you..price will be total empty plates on your table times S$1.5..free flow of green tea,just open the tap attached at your table for a hot water..free wasabi (I had my sushi without,cant stand the smell) free cured ginger..good place to eat..cheap n clean..fas

I went there several times. If you live pretty far away from the Pacific ocean and are not used to the finest quality Japanese food (like me), you can start from this place. For those who claim to know everything about sushi, i guess it could be nothing but typical Japanese fast food. But I was satisfied. And comparing with other Japanese restaurants, it is much cheaper
