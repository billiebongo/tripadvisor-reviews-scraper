If you are fan of Japanese/Korean BBQ then this is the place for you. Fantastically seasoned food and great service. Good location in the Clarke Quay area.

Service is good all the staffs are attentive. Beef tartar too much seasoning. The moriwase meat platter quality of the meat is just average not tender and some of the cuts are tough and not ossicle to chew

Located along the quay, it's a great location to dine either indoors, or inside and watch the passing crowds wander by, or take in the water and building views.Aburiya has the option of cook your own meal BBQ style over a pot of hot coals with a very wide range of meats and vegetables to choose from.On the night we visited, we chose from the extensive al la carte menu and chose the seafood pancake special (bit on the oily side), spring rolls ( still not sure what the non descript filling consisted of) which came with an excellent peanut sauce and chilli spiced cucumber dipping sauces, and the pick of the lot, a very hot bowl filled with rice, a raw egg and vwgables that cooked in the heat at the table as the waitress stored it vigorously A beer and a glass of wine rounded out the evening, although at S70+ it was very expensive for the amount and quality of the food...but that's Singapore I guess.Think there are better dining options in the vicinit

We came the week before and found that it was a lovely place and reasonable priced yakiniku place in Singapore. Charcoal cooking was lovely . However after careful consideration. Our second trip to this was a horrible. We ordered their 320g signature beef ( with sea salt) only to be given their sweet sauce version. And the meat was inconsistent . We asked for it to be taken back but the waiters tried to communicate with the owners and somehow it was lost in translation. We were given another plate of beef only for it to be super fatty. Think of us ordering lean meat to be given 65% fat and 35% meat. We asked for a knife and fork to cut out the fat from the beef and it was likely 260g worth of fat left on the plate . I kindly explained to another waiter who told us if only I managed to order the food from him.. it would have been fine. Sadly it if the place is consistent like yakuniku yazawa which deserves a consistent 5 star it would be more popula

Last night we returned to Aburiya to satisfy our cravings for Japanese BBQ food. It has been quite some time since we last dined at the Aburiya. The staff said that the store had recently been renovated.Weâ€™d ordered a salad, a selection of pork and chicken, mushroom and seafood. The meat were all well prepared and I like the size of each slice. They did not leave you with a guilty feeling of indulging in too much meat. Service was friendly and prompt. I will recommend Aburiya

Firstly, let me say that my friends and I have frequented Aburiya at Robertson Quay many times over the years. I myself have written positive reviews on TripAdvisor on as we really enjoy the food and service.However, I must say our experience last night at their new branch in Boat Quay has me doubting if we will ever be back.We made a reservation for a party of 4 on Sunday, 16/4/2017. I list down our poor dining experience here:1. We were not aware that the Robertson Quay place was closed for renovations and that they had a new branch in Boat QUay. Nobody on the phone informed us about the change in venue when we called, so we showed up at Robertson Quay (paying for parking!) only to be told we needed to go to Boat Quay2. We arrived just before 7pm at Robertson Quay. We ordered the beef platter, salad, beef tongue, rice and a plate of short rib (karubi). Plus drinks3. The salad and drinks were served and we waited till about 7.25pm before ordering a second serving of salad (none of the meat dishes were even out yet!). We reminded the waitress who apologized saying it was day 2 and it would be served shortly4. The karubi and beef tongue were served shortly after. We finished that around 7.40pm and still no sign of the beef platter.5. We reminded the waitress a second time about the beef platter and she brought the menu for us to confirm which platter it was. At this stage it was obvious they had forgotten the order, but OK, we continued to wait and even ordered an additional fois gras at the same time.6. 8pm and still nothing, I asked the Japanese lady about the beef platter, saying that we had already been there for an hour! After 5 minutes she came back and asked us which platter it was again! The second time! Really?7. At this point, we were fed up, half fed and extremely annoyed. We asked for the bill and paid our share before leaving (they had the fois gras which never came on the bill, which we asked them to take out, including the service charge)This was extremely poor service and we will definitely not patronize the Boat Quay branch again. It was my friend's birthday dinner and we left half-full and annoyed. It was a real letdown from a restaurant that we have all enjoyed over the years

Have never been disappointed with a meal here. Tonight had the Hokkaido Wagyu beef mega set. Meat was so soft and tender melted in the mouth like butter. Started with a spinach (Horenso) salad and hat yasai mori and oni giri as sides. More than enough for my Wife and I. Been eating here for close to 13 years now; while the menu has changed a bit over time the meats are as good as ever.

They have about 8 outside tables with the bbq built in the center. We prefer to sit outside to enjoy the people watching and breeze along the river.This is cook yourself bbq. Menu can be a bit overwhelming and staff are not much help, but we come enough that we figured it out. Overall, a solid place that we return to often as a family. Note- if you have kids, they can run just outside when done

Cook your own beef and seafood at the table. Lovely way to have dinner and the beef was excellent.
Staff were attentive and helpful.

Robertson Quay is a nice location for an evening meal & you have the choice of indoor & outdoor seating.
The food was generally very good & there's a wide selection.
The service was average.
5
Gone there for a "solo" dinner, the restaurant is quite nice and informal. I really enjoyed the fact that and you cook the meat by yourself. The wagyu meat was great, while the noodles I ordered are simply "standard" quality.

This is my 3rd time and still like it because of the meat quality, friendly service and no pretentious environment. We ordered 2 sets of different high quality beef, 2 portions of lamb, 1 portion grill vegetable, 1 portion salad and few draft beers, good enough for 3 people cost 220 bucks. Good experience for red meat lovers

I've been eating here for over 10 years and it's a regular favorite. Advise reservations on the weekend as it can get quite crowdedas it's popular with the Japanese expat community. Great selection of meats to grill. The wagyu platter is heavenly and the beef simply melts in you mouth. I always order the mixed veggies as well as oni giri and a spinach salad. Tare sauce is myfavorite marinade and we wash it all down with a nice, cold Asahi. Great selection of sides and basic seafood to grill as well. Managed by a very nice Japanese couple. Typical Singapore service at times, but once the dishes come you're free to grill to your hearts content. Kids enjoy visiting here as well

One expects Singapore restaurants to be expensive, but this one takes the cake. A mouthful and a drink for $90. I've had far better Korean BBQ exploding with flavor in Dubai for $5. The meal was extremely less than average. Lots of supposed exotic meat that was tasteless and the most meager serving of vegetables. I have seen scraps of leftovers for chicken feed that have better quality and variety. I only wish I had not eaten and donated the money to charity. Only reason to eat here is if you think its cool to pay a lot of money for pretentious overpriced valueless nothing. McDonalds has more taste and quality

We have been here 5 or 6 times in the past few years and have always been quite happy with the price / quality trade-off. So we decided to come here again for dinner last night, bringing along the kids and a few friends. We chose a selection of vegetables, pork, various wagyu and supplemented with fried rice and salad, and a large bottle of sake. Service was efficient and the food very good (in line with previous experiences). The place was very busy on Saturday night and I expect that we wouldn't have been able to get a table without a prior reservation. No doubt we will visit again in the not too distant future

My favourite SG spot for casual but good Japanese BBQ. Location is fine close to the waterfront (but not on it) in a quiet 'corner' of Robertson Walk/Quay. Tables inside and outside. Beef is generally good (had the wagyu set plus some angus). Veggies and dips 'a la mode'. Be careful not to overcook the thin tender slices ;-

went to aburiya for dinner on 6.10.2014. i had an excellent dinner here last on 19.3.2014. today was just as good!we ordered our usuals – kimchi chigae & bibimen. i love both these dishes.kimchi chigae always so tasty, with some slices of thin belly pork. i love the kurobuta kimchi nabe at shirokiya @ cuppage terrace but for a simple small helping of kimchi chigae, aburiya’s is the best.bibimen is something i come to like because my wife prefers it to bibimbap. now i get to like everything about it, flavours, texture. we decided to order the ohmi wagyu beef set (above & top photo). it looked marbled, tasted good, but somehow not quite matching our expectations of the intense marbled flavours of 1 of the 3 best kuroge wagyu (黑毛和牛) in japan, along with kobe & matsuzaka. somehow the last time we had the cheaper hokkaido wagyu here on 19.3.2014, it left a more lasting impression. maybe it’s better just to order karubi or jo-karubi than to have the tokumori mixed set.for me tajimaya@vivocity’s wagyu was pricy but good too only if there is amex 50% discount, but they did not have the kimchi chigae & bibimen we liked here, so the enjoyment was not the same.we had the cheap australian angus karubi negi (short ribs with leek). it was quite ok. anyway we had always liked it before we started trying the wagyu here.we tried the kurobuta & iberia pork set this time. it was really good. certainly better than the karubi. i think overall our enjoyment of the pork was more than even the ohmi tokumori set, not that the ohmi was poor.the bill came to S$143 nett for 3pax including a bottle of sake. quite ok for a very enjoyable dinner. see my full reviews & photos at = http://chefquak.com/2014/10/07/our-favourite-yakiniku-aburiya-on-6oct2014

BBQ your own food. Had the wagyu beef and shrimp with the garlic rice. Beef was ok and tends to be a bit thin so when cooked it can get a bit burnt. Shrimp a better choice and the garlic rice was very good. Food is served quickly but service a bit slow once food is served

Dinner for three for just under $60 per head. Outdoor dining around an in-table bbq. Waegyu beef. Tender and tasty, fresh vegetables, great fried rice. Not four star, but three is a little harsh
4
It is so much fun to BBQ at a table with good conversation and Aburiya is the place to do this.
Salads are top class; the meat is good.
Value for your buck is good enough.
5
No doubt that Aburiya is expensive but really when you take into account the quality and fast of the food, this is by far one of the betterJapanese robatayaki places in Singapore.
I particularly loved the portobello mushrooms, scallops, foie gras and beef short rib.
5
I frequent Aburiya a few times per month. It's hard to beat BBQ-ing beautiful cuts of meat with your friends while downing sake and sitting on the bank of the Singapore river.
Fantastic experience everytime!

had an excellent yakiniku dinner at aburiya on 19.3.2014. had not been there for a while..just checked my blog & it was almost a year ago that i had dinner at aburiya on 26.3.2013.the prices had gone up slightly. we basically ordered similar food. for this evening the jo karubi (S$15.90) was not that great but the cheaper karubi (S$10.90) was good. we also added hokkaido jo karubi (S$21.90) which was excellent, nicely marbled and very flavourful. they did not have the ohmi wagyu though it was on the menu.the inside tables were mostly taken up at 7pm. there were still quite many tables available outdoors.the dinner including sake (S$15) added up to S$105 for 2pax, not cheap but it was very enjoyable.

I love this place! Not only is the food very good, the service is also good. For first timer, it might be very confusing to order as you not only have to decide on the items to order, you need to decide on the sauce/condiments with the items. I always like the Karubi beef with salt, wagyu beef with wasabi shoyu, lamb in gk sauce, scallop with butter and corn with butter. For the non-grilled items, you can order the seaweed salad. We tried some noodles in spicy soup but it wasn't nice. Always call for reservation! Take the outdoor seats

We forgot to book, but had to wait only for 10 min in a nice area of Singapore, along the river with a beer or a sake.Fantastic meat marinated or not, simply cooked from the charcoal on each table. Delicious rice and mushrooms and definitely a very good dinner
4
Good choice of beef, pork and vegetables for grilling on a coal-fired grill.Decent selection of alcoholic drinks on offer at reasonable prices.Service could be improved, but the food still makes a visit here worthwhile.Paid approx. $290 SGD for dinner for 4 people including sake

but very small portions a very good ambiance and when we went there the manager was very helpfull in helping us to choose the mealswe took pork and sheep meat ( they bring them crued , very thin , and you grill them yourself )i remembered while there the corean restaurantsit was apleasant experienc

Aburiya is one of our favourite places in Singapore for Japanese BBQ meats. Located by the river, its a stone's throw from the bar and dessert places post dinner at Robertson Quay, serving a mix of local and Japanese customers.The selection of meats are good and well marinated. Asahi beer is served by the jug and complements the meal well. We always have a selection of beef, pork, and lamb, together with the fresh salads and fois gras. Do make reservations as its usually full, given the limited seating inside
