Beo Crescent Food Centre is a very established food court in Singapore, offering a good variety of Singapore Street/Local Food such as Nasi/Mee goreng, carrot cake, curry rice, Hainanese chicken rice, wantoon mee, besides many stalls selling kueh, fruit juices, beverages, etc. I'm a regular at this food centre. My favourite stalls are Ha Ha Big Prawn Noodle, No Name Hainanese Curry Rice (at the block in front), Shun Xing Wanton Mee, etc. Parking is easy and convenient with a multi-storey carpark next to it

We came to Beo Crescent by mistake....we were looking to head to Tiong Bahru for breakfast and ended up here. It's an easy mistake to make.....we took the MRT to the Tiong Bahru station and looked at the map at the station and headed off to the closest food centre, assuming it would be Tiong Bahru. As it turns out the well known Tiong Bhru Food Centre (which I am still yet to visit) is further away from the station....but the Beo Crescent Food Centre did not disappoint. We tried numerous dishes from various stalls.....all were outstanding, especially the carrot cake!There is also a market attached which is full of interesting things. We were there around 10.30am....so it wasn't overly busy. I highly recommend Beo Crescent Food Centre for an authentic Singapore Hawker Centre experience
