The restaurant is newly renovated and there is an increase in price perhaps to offset for Reno cost. Food standard remained the same and perhaps a little bit of small portion also.

The bak kut teh is really nice. Both soup and dry style are available. The price is affordable and ambience is nice and quiet especially during weekday evening.
