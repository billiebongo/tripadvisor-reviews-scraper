Been there a couple of times for coffee and to do work on weekends. There are a few tables that allow you to have connectivity to power sockets. The coffee is decent and relatively cheap as well.

Tucked in Thomson V is this cosy cafe serving refreshing fruit chef salad and their duck meal - tender, juicy and full of pretty good surprises - all created by their young and talented in-house chef!

I feel like this was a real find, a treasure tucked away quietly in Thomson V. It was empty when we went, which was perfect for one on one time. The back of the cafÃ© in particular has a cosy sofa area to lounge on. It was raining when we went and the pitter patter of the rain on the glass roof lulls you into a dreamy afternoon that would be perfect with a good book, a nice cuppa joe and some good ol' imagination

Happened upon this place on the way to our parked car.The covered back patio is quiet and gets these incredible wafts of baking cake aroma.You must try the Sparks special wrap, an explosion of flavors - spicy sausage, shrimp, peaches, eggs etc.All this served on quaint plates.Very friendly service and reasonable prices.Will be back

The sugee cake here is very yummy! Other than that, the mains were not too bad, and we preferred the Oven Baked Duck to the Rosemary Chicken. The mash potato side was deliberately served cold with bacon bits, and we felt that it was delicious :
