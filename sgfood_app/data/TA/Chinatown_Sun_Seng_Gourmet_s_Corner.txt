This stall have 50 years + experience in F&B trade since after world war 2. Old uncle parents start selling porridge in early days. Just in front Majestic cinema. They move up to chinatown food court complex in early 80s.

Tucked at the corner of the huge Chinatown Complex Market, this stall has been here for a long time. Somehow I do not try the food until recently.The old uncle only sells simple Cantonese hor fun (flat noodle), Yee Mee (Dry Chinese noodle) and fried rice. This is not the typical stir-fried Cantonese stall.I had tried twice and I must say it was delicious. Slced fish with bittergourd hor fun and sliced fish with fermented bean hor fun. The "wok-breath" hor fun was very well done. The fish used here is the snake head fish, sweet and fresh. For $5 a plate, I find the portion was quite small.The unlce is getting old and I wonder who will take over if he retires. Do not miss. Go and try before it is too late
