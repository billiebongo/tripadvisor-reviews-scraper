Had the double burger with double order of spicy fries.
Great choice. Food is good. Wife had Cajun chicken and said it was delicious. On the main Rd easy in and out.

Botak Jones is a must try if you are into big portions of food. They are generous with their servings and the staff are friendly too. Plenty to choose from the menu and I love the cajun fries ~

went to this place for dinner, the outdoor place was something different. Eating under the stars and moonlight was a quite experience. Do not bother about the food,it was standard eventhough the portion was generous

Ordered the NZ Sirlon and it sorta tasted like on the old side you know a lil tough... Would not order it again... I really enjoyed the chili cheese fries 👍👍👍

Botak jones used to be famous for good food, huge portions and generous prices. This unfortunately is not seen anymore. Food are no longer the fresher ingredients. Beef patties and meats very 30-40% of its original size. And worse of all prices have almost doubled. Smaller portion of food and double the price. Doesnt make economic sense.
