We sat at the bar and it was fascinating to see our orders immediately acted upon, and the chef creating the dishes. Service was top notch.
5
very good food and some specialties. Cozy environment and nice service staffs. A good place to have a nice dinner and gathering
5
very good food, services and good environment, definitely a place worth to visit again. We love most the wagyu don
1
When we entered and passed by the counter smelling something very fishy, like old fishy, we probably should've turned around, however the pouring rain outside made us give it a shot. The tables are in a really dark room, could barely read the menu, and when the food arrived we were appalled, the so-called "fresh catch of the day" sashimi tasted like it had been dead for months and had been stored in a hot room, it was truly inedible! Ordered a drink that never showed up, and when I asked he said some girl from another party had taken it! Ok, if you knew that why didn't you make another one and bring it over? Just bad, period
4
Izy was surprisingly empty when we went, but the food was beautifully presented, had lovely favours and the service was greatly appreciated by all the party
3
Before leaving the UK we booked this restaurant for a Sunday night. We turned up on the Sunday night to find the place closed and the timetable on the door stating that it was closed on a Sunday and could not understand why the website had allowed us to reserve a table if it was closed. We went back online and booked for the following night. The following night we turned up and were told that the bar was closed and therefore cocktails were not available. Neither the website nor the restaurant itself informed customers that the bar was not open on a Monday.The service wasn't particularly good. Whilst the staff knew a lot about the food they were not particularly welcoming.The food itself was good but not anything special. It was quite expensive for what it was.Overall the restaurant was quite a disappointment and I think there are better places to eat in the area.
3
Excellent meat sandwich (a seasonal offering). Wagyu garlic fried rice was a tad too salty - if you're ordering this, try not to eat the garlic chips as they add too much saltiness.
5
Otoro and Kinmedai Sashimi are extremely fresh and good, Wagyu and white truffle don is one of the best, we love it.
5
There is a bar hidden at the back of Izy's (Japanese restau-bar dining) located in the front of Club street along Chinatown which is a hidden treasure for those who love privacy, intimacy, and quite a unique experience. The bar itself is named after french word which means Hidden. It serves a wide variety of beers, whiskey, sake, wine and their signature items - cocktails. Their cocktails were uniquely crafted by their head bar manager - Shinya Koba which is an art for me and in season. I have a couple of favorites but one stands out the artistic and fruity Sakura cocktail, which is a combination of ume-shiso liqueur, dry sherry and maraschino liquer. The bar is open from Mon to Sat and there is a cocktail promotion of $10 from 6 to 9 PM. To get there you must go inside Izy's but you don't need to necessarily eat at Izy's. Reservation is recommended especially on Friday's and weekends. The tables and chair are very comfortable and relaxing. The bar chair sits only 4 but you get to see the experience of cocktail preparation done by bar manager Shinya-san. It is my first time to see how he carved ice using a sharpened knife and each drink has its own uniquely shape carved ice. Food is also served coming from Izy and you could also get cocktails from Cache' even if you sit in Izy. They also provide free wi-fi and toilet is very clean and large. I would be back for more and excited to see what else Cache' would offer for their cocktails on the next season
5
We had already eaten dinner elsewhere but popped into IZY for a drink and ended up eating some more. The Cache bar at the back of the restaurant is one of the coolest bars I've ever been to, and the murals in IZY are excellent. We had cocktails, some excellent dragon rolls and sake. The bar has leather panelled walls and illuminated cubby holes that contain all kinds of interesting artefacts. Thoroughly recommended
4
We had the wagyu truffle don and the kaisendon. Very fresh and good quality ingredients! Wish they had more variety for small dishes apart from the main.
4
First time at IZY, the Japanese food is fresh with a slight modern twist. Would want to see a bit more variety on the menu for food. Drinks menu was quite comprehensive nonetheless.
4
Service is excellent. Food is good but a tad expensive even for set lunch for the size that you pay. Will try other dishes next time.
1
I was there for a lunch with a friend. We were sitting at the counter. Food was good. But we saw something amazing: a client, next to me, didn't finish his glass of red wine (wine by the glass), so the barman took it, brought the open bottle and the glass to the kitchen and filled the bottle in with the non-finished glass of wine. This is unacceptable. I will never come back there
3
Decent Japanese. Some staff used to be from Hashida. Sushi rolls are quite good. I would say somewhat expensive though
3
Was looking forward to the visit but not was surprised. Food was average and portions small. Was looking forward also to the Japanese tomato but in the end it was a small cold tomato served with salt on the side. Sit inside as it's jt at the tables near the entrance.
4
I alwyas like Izy but not my foreign companions. Sashimi was good but they dint like the grilled fish.
4
Cosy place with nice atmosphere. Went here for late dinner. Sashimi was fresh and tasty, all other roll what did I try was good. As dessert i choose raspberries sorbet with chilly usually I don't like this combination but it was well balanced and really amazing. Next time will come to try matcha ice cream.
4
Had to stand a while at the entrance before anyone noticed me (maybe I am too short ), but after I got seated, the waiters were so attentive & service was overall good. Special shoutout to the guy with the cool forearm tattoos (sorry didn't get your name) who asked me about my ring light - I told him it's a selfie light but I use it for food. Makes food beautiful but not my self(ie) Mango Salsa Roll ($18++)Tempura Shrimp, Raw Salmon, Avocado, Homemade Mango Salsa SauceCan't go wrong with rolls. This was alright, but I felt like the other dishes I ordered outshone this. Cool plating though.Wagyu Truffle Don ($38++)Josper Grilled Wagyu Beef & Onsen Egg on Rice, topped with Fresh Truffle SlicesThis looks small in photos - but when it arrived in front of me, I was pleasantly surprised. Could be a matter of expectations - though it's not HUGE or anything. Flavour was awesome, beef slices tender & everything just went so well together. Uni Pasta ($28++)Homemade Uni Sauce Pasta with Fresh Sea UrchinThis was something unique- it did not disappoint. The sauce was epic umami, & the uni was uber fresh. I wish the pasta were slightly more al dente. But seeing as to how it wasn't soggy (just me being fussy), I'd actually still order this again. In all, this isn't at the price point where I'd come here often, but it is definitely worth the splurge for a special occasion. Also, I had some Chope perks to redeem, so this helped with the $. Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats available Accepts reservations - I used Chope Chope vouchers availabl
4
Giving 4 stars which is the average of 5 stars for the food (which is outstanding and good value), but only 3 stars for the drinks (which are limited apart from the sake list which is very expensive)
4
$45 for a sushi roll but it was amazing. topped with a dollop of uni. the other izy roll was awesome as well. would recommend this place for food
5
Portions for the wagyu truffle bowl are a little small. Enjoyed the fois gras and truffle though. Would be nice if they had hot green tea, which they didn't.
5
Super in love with the fresh sushi rolls and would definitely return again. Desserts are so good too,must order Sweet potato with ice cream! On the pricier side but worth it.
4
Good location creative menu and friendly service. If you looking for a fun adventorous menu its the ideal place
5
I brought my fiancee here for dinner as a Birthday treat. Food and service was great as always and it's fun sitting at the bar and seeing the chefs create the dishes. Already booked our next visit.
4
Had lunch with a few clients. High stools only. Service was excellent and the food was good. The chicken karage was excellent as was the seafood croquette. The gyoza was so-so. The sashimi rice bowl I had was also good though you can probably get the equivalent elsewhere. Would highly recommend the chicken karage and the seafood croquette
5
Nokke roll and wagyu bowl was yummy. Uni was fresh and delicious. We were seated at the bar and was fun watching the chef work. Staff were very attentive as well and kept the water and sake flowing. Goma ice cream was tasty but tad grainy, I didn't mind. Hubby enjoyed the srawberry chili sorbet even though he's not a dessert person.
4
There was such a variety of food on the menu and it all seemed to be quite fun. We decided on the dragon rolls which was really tasty. Every mouthful is a great combination of flavours from the eel and the tempura as well as the sauces. The dressing on the Shabu Shabu salad was refreshing and sweet. The steak was just divine. Service started off a bit awkward but was great afterwards. Seating is a bit too high, quite uncomfortable and air con is turned quite high
4
We went on a weekday for lunch. The place was really quiet but the staff are all friendly and service was great. We had the lunch menu which includes a light salad and a miso soup. Food is decent but not wow wow. But the black sesame ice cream was really topnotch. Great place to lunch if you want to avoid the usual CBD lunch crowd
5
We were looking for a nice Japanese restaurant that wouldn't break the bank. I stumbled across this restaurant + bar combo. We sat at the chef's section (he's Japanese of course) and because he had spent some time in the UD before coming to Singapore, he was able to talk to us about the various dishes. The fish was very fresh and just at the right temperature (not cold), with perfectly made Japanese sushi rice in accompanyment. The Japanese bartender was also fantastic. We ordered a whisky sour, and he came out later to chat to us to explain his interpretation of the drink. It was so good we both orgered seconds! A must visit: good quality sushi, great drinks at fairly affordable prices.
3
one of the better beef bowls around. meat, egg, truffle... good service too from amanda. quite a relaxing atmosphere. would return
4
Service was amazing. This is one of my go to restaurants. Food is always good but really expensive too
4
Had a lovely customized Chirashi. Staffs are warm and friendly. They made cautious effort to check-in on our dining experience.
5
izakaya style japanese tapas - the foie gras is amazing and rich, the wagyu truffle don similar, and sake is generally well priced and delicious. we will keep coming back
4
Came here to finish off a Club St brunch crawl.
Trendy place with decent prices for sushi and sashimi. Ordered the yellowtail and scallops sashimi which were fantastic. Also got the croquettes and gyozas which were OK but nothing special.
Solid place, I like it.
3
Food was mediocre for the kind of pricing.. was expecting more wow factor since the review for the restaurant online was good
5
Ambience cozy chic place. Love bar counters and able to interact with Masa Chef. Service from a lady named Amber so sweet and thoughtful! Food quality is good and portion and price reasonable. Nice location too!
4
Saturday evening reservation at IZY, looking for something healthier than I had been eating. The vegetable selection was good, the IZY roll a deep fried prawn version of a California roll, crab croquette was average, the edamame was fresh rather than frozen, the gyukatsu was very nicely cooked and the sweet potato with butter and vanilla ice cream was tasty. Chef made a good sake suggestion to go with the food. 180SGD in total
3
At lunchtime this is a cold dull place. Bare bleak walls and a waitress more occupied on her mobile phone than greeting or serving customers adds to the I could not care less attitude.Average food served with no style makes this a folorn place to visit.I hope they are busier and keener to please in the evening otherwise this place will soon disappear.High prices too
5
The staff at Izy were friendly and welcoming... Thank you to the Head chef Masa San and host Amber made this an experience I will treasure.. We asked the chef to.surprise us and he exceeded our expectations... Have to say without a doubt the best and most exciting Japanese I have ever ate.. This is the second time I have been here and the food is Fresh, balanced and new flavours and above all consistently delicious... A must for everyone... Will visit on all.my journeys to.singapore in the future..
4
Unlike most of Japanese restaurant is rather western style. The environment and is unique, also the food. Although the food is not "very Japanese", but it is delicious.
4
Popped in here for a quick lunch today. Chirashi set for $25++. Only disappointment was that it didn't include a dessert, but otherwise very tasty. Restaurant was almost empty at lunchtime.
5
Recommended to us and we were not disappointed. We shared lots of plates including: pork & ginger rolls, sashimi, smoked potato, yam and chicken karaage. Staff were friendly and informative. Beer was good as well.
5
Best dishes - the pork ginger roll, the foie gras, the wagyu don. we sat in the back, which is a cozy and elegant dining area
4
Good addition to the Club St dining scene. This low-key Japanese restaurant was completely empty when I went for lunch recently. Tried a few things: the tempura set was fine, not outstanding but the sushi, gyoza and some of the other appetisers/side dishes were. Good service, but then we were the only guests there
4
Didn't manage to try that many things on the menu so can't quite comment on everything, but what I did try I rather liked. In particular, the Nokke Roll ($38), a flavour explosion of negitoro, crabmeat and ikura topped with fresh, sweet uni, was superbly enjoyable. The Truffle Wagyu Don ($38) was good too - the beef was smooth, tender and rich in taste and the fresh truffle was light and fragrant. Onsen egg within was perfectly cooked. And the cocktails are awesome! My elderflower one called Blue Moon came with a ROSE ice rock... like wow
5
Izy Dining & Bar is great for a chill out session in a typical Japanese-styled setting. We had 2 sushi rolls, the Izy Roll and Crunch Roll, the gyu katsu (with tender beef and a crispy coating) and the wagyu tomato sukiyaki (sweet and savour sauce with wagyu slices) etc. The chilli sorbet is a must-order with hints of spiciness in between the coolness of the sorbet
4
I've been here for dinner twice, and lunch twice, and have always enjoyed the experience. Sitting at the bar counter for dinner is a really good way to have close chats with friends and near enough to the kitchen action. Quality of food is really amazingly good and chef Wesley explains each dish he makes and serves
3
First time was amazing following the degustion menu with selection of wines, talking with the chef, sampling sake etc..Second time was ok as we went a la carte so less surprises..Third time was disappointing especially by the poor service, lack of ambiance, most of wine of the very short list were sold out ... The magic was gone..
3
Recent trip to Club street in Singapore and we decided to give Izy a try. The joint is set up as a long bar table with stools with the chefs cooking in front and set up almost like a trendy nightclub. The food portions are tapas style (code for small) but the pricing is not. So we ordered a selection of dishes including the japanese josperized beef (expensive and average), sushi of the day (which was great), crab croquettes (poor), tempura (reasonably decent) and the black sesame panacotta style moose (which was great). The staff were not really focussed and we were a little annoyed with the lazyness. The bill arrived and i thought it was way overpriced (value for money just does not exist in Singapore). So this joint was just "ok" but I would think twice about it given the numerous (and equally expensive) choices in Singapore.
5
The service staff were very personal and attended to our needs promptly.
The tuna served was really good and will definitely return soon.
The only downside is that it tends to be more rowdy given its a bar environment.
5
I've been twice to this restaurant and both times client service was simply excellent. This people care about their customers and the quality of the food is very high, well presented and fresh. Top Japanese restaurant in Singapore.
We'll come back for sure.
5
Great place for a stylish meal and drink. Delicious food, classy cocktails and attentive service. Dark and moody booth seating out back perfect for a relaxed and romantic dinner.
4
This is a restaurant that doesn't disappoint everytime I visit. Service is great for anyone who wants a good night out with friends at Club Street. Highly recommend!
5
There is plenty of good food in Singapore, but very few also have the superb service we have come to love at Izy. Our favourite Singapore restaurant.
5
I will visit Izy every time I go back to Singapore and it is just amazing place for a quick lunch as well as special occasion. Cocktails are inspiring and the beef don is definitely my favorite!
5
This restaurant is awesome.I went there with friends and we ordered the Kobe, which was fantastic. Also the tempura and the sushi were very nice.Staff is helpful and the maitre was great in advising us; this is an example of the Japanese hospitality.Price is ok, not cheap but adequate for the high level of the food. The wine list is exhaustive and there is the wifi.I will definitely come back
5
From start to end, everything was great! I can find any fault with this restaurant. Service, Quality of food and Ambience a total satisfaction. We had the Omakase and all the dishes were prepared with such great detail and importantly, TASTY!In addition, we tried the onsen egg (I hope I get the name right), a salmon dish top with rice and their special homemade sauce. The recommendation of sake was very good too. Must return with a bigger group to try out their Tommahawk Kobe Wagyu Steak, 1.5kg. Woohoo. Will definitely walk out "belly" full :)
5
I've been there twice, both times sitting at the bar counter where the chef makes the food - love the place and personalized service. Even more important is the home-made dishes created by the chef, Wesley. Excellent quality (the beef is melt-in-your-mouth) on just about everything from the appetizer to the dessert. His home-made silky tofu is amazing
5
I have been to this hip Japanese bar/eatery a few times after work.Each time, I always ordered their Teriyaki chicken don. Fixing the perfect poached egg, big chicken chunks and streamed rice together is such a relaxing experience after a stressful day at work.The art deco of this place is sort of "pop art" - reminding me Kill Bill 1 snow scene
5
Fusion Japanese restaurant close to Telok Ayer. Go there if you want to try out modern Japanese food by attentive waiters. Strongly recommend to try the sake as well. Last but not least, you can ask them for the secret door to their cocktail bar!
4
We had the tasting menu for $95++. Food was great, although the fried / battered oysters were seriously fishy and couldn't finish.
Highlight was cocktails, incredible version of Moscow mule and Tom Collins. Bill ended up $400+ for 2.
5
It really was special, amazing food ( I can still take it now) fantastic staff and great location! Sit up on the bar so you can watch the chefs at work. Still one of the best meals we've ever had.
4
Great service and love the food!
Cocktails are alright and can offer more options. Order the beef truffle rice bowl.
5
The service was very efficient. We had their set lunch and it was filling and very very good! Very value for money
5
Must visit in Singapore! Japanese fusion at a reasonable price - $sg 150 for two for two mains and drinks @ lunch time.. Friendly waiters who help you choose food and drink.. I will definitely visit again.
5
It was my first time, and I brought a friend from Hong Kong for a quiet dinner. We sat at the long bar counter had the gastronomic dinner menu, which was excellent. Great personal service form the chef and staff, and the food was very very good. Highly recommend for a great dinner experience, and food served direct to you at the counter kitchen
4
I have visited this restaurant/bar on Club Street serving Japanese food, and really likes the dÃ©cor/ambiance.The food menu was original/creative, service was good, quality/taste was ok, presentation beautiful but price too high (100 SGD per person/ around 60EUR). We took the following dishes:- Sashimi: salmon, octopus, white fish, shrimp - 50SGD (!!) - quality was ok, presentation nice- Crab (kani) croquette: not tasting much like crab- Raw vegetables in a jelly (very good)- Tempura with a miso foam - disappointing (the miso foam was not good with tempura...)- Sushi roll - good- Pinapple granite with shiso leaf - very goo
5
This was one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. Its Japanese Izakaya brought to you in chic and style! The cocktail selection is so beautifully done whether it be whisky or the cockatil. They have a tasting menu, but we went there for light bites and drinks, I would definitely recommend their chilli sorbet, as the flavor profile was intensely spicy yet left you wanting more. Be prepared to break your wallet though, ecause it is Japanese menu with those kind of prices :
5
This is a fantastic restaurant with great food, great service - even with a limited detox diet you can go here without concern. The vibe is warm, the open kitchen puts you in the middle of the energy, the service very attentive and the food to die for. I go back to this restaurant for birthdays, to take family, for people in town as THE place that i know will always impress, what more can i say? I'm going back again in 2 weeks when i'm off my detox so that I can have sake this time
5
Great food, ambience and service! Double thumbs up! Love the crispy chicken karaage and foie gras!!!
5
Great sake, great food, and great service. Can't remember the exact dish, but something wrapped in bacon was amazing and ordered a few orders!
5
very good sakes and great service and funky chef too! nice ambience. we sat somewhere in the middle and loved it. wagyu truffle don was so yummy we ordered another portion.
4
Very good sakes and a variety of sakes + friendly service that comes with great sake knowledge.. and great food
4
Being a Japanese food snob, I normally prefer traditional Japanese but Izy was good!
Nice food - price was a bit higher than I would have expected but surrounds were good and service to match.
5
Amazing sophisticated surprising Japanese fusion food. A real journey.... The wine by the glass was great especially the champagne. Sake amazing butI am not an expert Some communication breakdown with the waitress who was charming and friendly.A great moment . Not cheap but worth the money about 200$ each.
5
We went for the lunch set, which is supposed to be better value for money for this high-end expensive bar/restaurant. However, as we start to chat with the chef and sake master, we kept tasting different kinds of sake and ordered more food because it's just delicious! The truffle beef is a come-back set, which I, even not a big carb diner, finished the whole bowl of Nigiata rice! And my friend ordered another plain bowl of rice after a carafe of sake. Pork wrapped ginger roll is one of the you-can-not-miss dishes in Singapore. Pork is tasty and the ginger adds to the crunchy texture. I never knew fried yam can be so delicious and kid you not, this deep fried crispy is healthy for you as well! I will definitely come back more than once. For business though because it's a bit pricey. 
4
First time at Izy. Thought the food was good. Lots of small plate choices to stimulate the palate. Atmosphere was great and seating was very comfortable. Felt like we had our own private table off to the side of the back room. Thought they could have had a better dessert selection
5
Japanese is probably not the first choice for tourist, let alone fusion Japanese. We booked the restaurant after reading a post by a friend who then highly recommended us to visit. We had a lovely time, their cocktails, although only serving the classics, were very tasty. Their selection of sake (even their sake of the day) was perfect to go with our main course, the Tomahawk steak. It was my first time to take the steak with Wasabi as condiment. It was surely an eye-opening experience!! (Super super tasty)We didn't see any tourist when we were there, the locals are hiding this hidden gem for a good reason
5
My boyfriend chose this place based on the amazing reviews it has received. We were seated towards the back vs. the bar. Seats were not too comfy or rather overly comfy. I felt like I completely got swallowed by my chair as it was too soft, but I am not going to fault the place on that account. Music was amazing (for the pretentious 'hipster' that I am), really cool atmosphere, and the food was truly incredibly. I lost count of how much we ordered as a group of four, but I felt that we tried the majority of the menu. The maki was pretty sub-par but everything else was A++. Certainly not the cheapest Japanese restaurant, but you definitely get what you pay for and its all worth it! The staff were great and on top of things. Always something I can appreciate as a guest. We shall return
4
Funky Japanese tapas restaurant at the end of Club Street. The Chef's tasting menu ($$$) is worth trying. Good drinks, trendy ambience, lounge in the back (usually empty though). Usually bar stool seating. Head to bars on Club St for drinks after.
4
Loved the small plates that are great for sharing and the cocktails were nice. Decor is conducive for conversations
4
Easy to get to for lunch and they do a set with organic salad and includes miso soup. I enjoyed my Wagyu Truffle Don and the Chicken Karaage starter, if only the portions were a little bigger!
4
Location - and add to that, good service and a signature omakase menu, yes, we've got a winner - IZY's!! The upbeat modern jap bar/restaurant is young, fun, casual yet classy yet different and 6 course omakase below $100/pax is a draw. However, we settled for the wagyu rice beef bowl and the sea urchin pasta with extra sea urchin! The latter, I slurped up quickly with just right portion as anymore and it would be too rich for my palate. We shared the carpaccio of the day which was tuna with yuzu dressing for extra oomph! Who wants dessert when we can dip in sweet salty soy sea foam the vegetable tempura of sweet mushrooms and baby maize amongst the medley of battered veggies. Quite ingenious. I will be back - late night soon for the Seafood porridge cooked in lobster stock and variety of seafood. Closed Sunday
5
The food was amazing, the vibe was fab as the restaurant is cozy, yet not overbearing, and the service was seamless. When I was last at this restaurant, I happened to leave an expensive item of jewelry in the bathroom and the staff returned it to me. This is my 3rd time dining at this place over a space of more than a year and each time I return, the manager remembers me and even my favorite dish - how awesome is that
5
This is the best food I ever had on a restaurant. Period.Exceptionell good service, atmosphere and taste. We had the tasting meny and all the items very over the top. Ive been here 3 times during 2014 and it was a fantastic moment every time. My absolute favorite place to eat so far. Love it
5
I heard so much about this place and it did not disappoint. Was truly amazing from the mural on the wall to the awesome staff whom were so helpful to the very cool atmosphere. The selection of sake was great and the one that was chosen for us was gold. The wagyu steak was such a highlight. Ammmmmmaaaaaazingly yummy. Have to get to this joint
5
This restaurant is food heaven for lovers of Japanese food who are also adventurous. The fusion of flavours and cuisines is divine! Foie gras with white miso and mango passion sauce was to die for as was the more traditional wagyu beef. The creamy Gorgonzola ice cream was inspirational and I am now in possession of the recipe. Lovely attentive staff, trendy bar. It was so good we came for lunch and back for dinner all in one day. We have made a note to come back when we are in Singapore next year. Well done
5
This is a fantastic little bar on club street with exceptional food - no surprise as the chef worked at Waku Ghin in Singapore and Tetsuya's in Sydney. Just make sure to reserve a table in the front bar area - very fun to be with the chefs! Service was excellent and our waiter was extremely friendly and eager to please. The swordfish is a must and the sashimi was fantastic! My husband also loved the pork konkatsu - it just melts in the mouth! We loved everything on the menu!Great for a fun night out with friends for some Japanese food and Sake! Kanpai
3
I wanted to like this place, I really do. But the dishes definitely has a "trying too hard" issue. The chef tried to ensure that there is a burst of flavors in almost every dish - sweet, spicy, sour and salty.....and not in a good way.With good ingredients, sometimes all you need is to let the ingredients shine through and there is no need to over-season. We tried practically almost all the recommended items, and some were just bad (karage chicken), some were interesting (like hmmm, interesting, but we don't have to eat it again).Another disappointing tapas bar. I am almost giving up on tapas in Singapore.
5
The menu is interesting and inventive, the service was a pleasure, and this restaurant goes to the top of my list in Singapore.
4
The steak was absolutely delicious. Perfectly cooked and seasoned, from tasmania. The dessert was also fantastic, chilli and strawberry sorbet. Excellent service. I would definitely return.
5
Best known for their Chicken Karaage and Gyu Don! On some days, there are also interesting dishes to try out such as Onsen Tomago, Claypot Chicken Rice with Truffle - done traditionally with a twist of creativity! Say YES to Shiso Sorbet for dessert.
4
Decided to try here based on tripadvisor reviews. Arrived and realised this is 1 of those new fangled restaurants with bar seating and industrial design. Once seated, they asked if we wanted still or sparkling. I'm always disappointed when they omit the tap water option because their profit desperation becomes obviousWe opted for the set dinner, which is made up of 7 dishes. Also ordered sake1st appetizer was a mousse with uni, which was a good start. 2nd dish was a selection of 4 types of sashimi. Despite the excellent plating, you can tell from the selection that competing with the best of sushi restaurants here is not what they're trying to do. The grilled sardine was ok, the chicken soup tasted like a regular Chinese broth. The beef was probably the best dish, followed by the fish noodle with egg that came after. Dessert was a selection of sweets and chocolateOverall it was good food and service, though not excellent. At $200 per person, it's also rather overprice
4
Celebrated my birthday with a dinner at Izy. First time there. Good food, good and friendly service. The staff presented my dessert with a candle on it when they were told by my date that it was my birthday, and also sang me a birthday song. I suppose most servers will be too shy to do that, so kudos and thanks to them. :)The chicken karaage was awesome, sashimi was fresh. The truffle wagyu beef bowl is also worth a try definitely. The sake pairing was also a great experience. Will be back
5
A friend of mine introduced me to this restaurant along Club St and after trying the place out, I was back within a week. The service was as impeccable as the food. The ambience in itself was an attraction. There are a few tables indoor and outdoor but most of the seating is at the kitchen counter. From the counter, you'll be able to witness the chefs creating delights gastronomical which is definitely a treat.Each dish proved to be unique from the usual Japanese offerings from other restaurants. Though the food is costly and the portions appear to be small, Izy is definitely a try. I recommend the chicken karaage, the wagyu don, the sea urchin pasta and if you're feeling adventurous, try the omakase menu!Nearest MRTs: Chinatown, Telok Aye
4
Pay a visit. Good fish, good meat, easy going but nice service. Excellent japanese "bistro". Yeap the choices may be a bit limited may you get is really tasty, looking as good as it is. Remind me of traditional sushi shops in Japan, where the chef serves you what he got from the market, catch of the day...Besides, ideal location in trendy club st on wed/fri/sat. 2 guests table of 6 to 8, otherwise counter not as convivial if you are more than 2 and wish to chat during the service. Price wise, "ok" for Singapore and fish/meat dishes. The "gastro" menu can climb with sake. Nonetheless several other combinations and a cool place to go to.Bon appÃ©tit

Was always captivated by the beautiful decanter lights that hang from the ceiling of this restaurant whenever I pass it after work. Finally visited Izy with colleagues for a dinner there . Located at the historical club street, izy exudes a trendy vibe in contrast to the old shophouses here. We had the pork ginger rolls, the assorted starter, octupus carpaccio, brasied pork . For the mains,we shared the grilled pork skewers, seafood porridge and the wagyu beef. Its good we came as a group as we can sample these different dishes. Each dish was creative executed from the presentation, the choice of ingredients, the freshness and the quality of the food. The pork was so tender. Love the seafood porridge which was full of sweetness from the fresh seafood oysters, lobster within the porridge. The restaurant was packed and the mood was lively. We had an enjoyable time here. The manager was also knowledge about the menu which was great as it was our first time here and trying out this style of Japanese cuisine. Will come back again..

Been to Izy a few times for dinner and highly recommend it. Great atmosphere and the food is out of this world, especially the Chicken Karaage. The chef makes traditional dishes combines with interesting flavors. Been there for lunch too, limited choices though when I went but apparently they were expanding the lunch time menu. If you are looking for good traditional Izakaya food with some funky flavors and a nice relaxing atmosphere I would highly recommend this place

I've been to Izy twice (once for a wine tasting event, and once I ordered ala carte). It's slightly pricey for small plates - but that's Singapore for you these days - but everything was really solid. I was surprised by the consistency and the interesting flavour combinations. Staff was friendly and generally obliging. Definitely order the chicken karaage, and the wrapped bacon with sansho. If you have space, share a gyu don. Only thing I thought was just so-so was the grilled fish. It's perfectly competent, but I was expecting more, flavour-wise. I'll skip this next time (yes, I will come back). If there's one thing I could change, it'd be the music choice. Miley Cyrus, Kylie Minogue and Madonna were on the tunes menu on my second visit (and way too loud at that). I honestly felt like I was like hanging out at the gym with a bunch of teenagers. I'd much prefer cool jazz or chill-out tracks while I dine on hip Asian small plates, and drink artisanal beer or wine

Went for dinner with the husband and was blown away by the food. Ambience was good and service was very attentive. Everyone should eat there!

Great food with a set of friendly staff. Look out for Steve. Very knowledgable about his food menu and he made some outstanding recommendations during my visit. Definitely worth going back to again.

A really good place. The food is carefully prepared to perfection. Only minus was the music.. You would expect cool bar house but they play trance that does not fit the ambience. Good service and exellent food!

Izy puts a new twist on Gourmet style Cuisine with a new skool vibe! Omakase was some of the best i had, and ending with a Wagyu Truffle Bowl! Prices were very considering all the courses i had. Tucked behind the Resto was another room that just put a Capital C on the word Chic! Great place great food and great drinks! A must try on my list

I was in Singapore for a quick business trip from Switzerland and was recommended this up and coming restaurant by a colleague. It did not disappoint. We were immediately greeted with welcoming arms by manager Marcus, and were looked after like kings throughout the meal. I had the taster menu, I can't honestly remember all the names of the dishes but all were exceptional. The one dish I do remember particularly, was the Wagyu beef, because I ordered another! It was that good. The atmosphere was vibrant and well laid out. Lovely old Singaporean style building decorated with a modern interior and truly welcoming staff. Its clearly a popular place as every seat was taken. After dinner we proceeded to bar in the back, which initially, I had no idea was there. It's a hidden gem, great space. Amazing selection of drinks and a cosy atmosphere. Superb restaurant, well done, next time i'm in town I will certainly go back

Izy is part of the new trendy dining options sprouting up around the island. The concept is based around a modern take of the traditional Japanese izakaya grill restaurants, so that should give you a hint as to what's on the menu.We went for a 6 course Omakase dinner paired with wines and cocktails. The food was well cooked but what we felt set this place apart was the great decor, ambience and service, all which help add to a great night out. Prices are a bit steep for the level of cooking and portions you're getting, but if you're up for a different night out with Japanese grilled dishes done in small plates you should do fine.The casual atmosphere and attentive and honestly cheerful staff are the stars though

Had the fish carpaccio, yam fritters, potato salad, wagyu beef don and noodles, fried chicken with vegetables and some skewered meat. The yam fritters, fish carpaccio and wagyu beef rice and the vegetables that accompanied the chicken was yummy but the rest was so so. The portions are ok to be shared with 2-3 persons. The beer was however pretty costly at abt SGD16-24 bucks a beer. We paid abt sgd 220 for 3. I would go back for the beef rice. I may try the omakase next time if I can't find another jap place to tr

For those new to the concept, Omakase is when you literally "leave it" to the chef to make all the decisions. I entrusted my dining experience to Chef Kaz and he certainly made it worth my while.I was there to celebrate my wedding anniversary and my wife and I knew we were off to a good start when Chef Kaz suggested a bottle of Gasanryu Jonjozo Koka sake to start off dinner. Aromatic with a fresh succulent taste, its subtle elegance complimented the food, ensuring it didn't overpower the delicateness of his masterpiece on offer.To the food proper. First up was the Shougamaki - Ginger Roll with grilled pork belly served with Sancho spices. The slight sharpness of the ginger paired well with the melt-in-your-mouth pork belly. The strange surprise was unforgettable. It was arguably my favourite dish of the evening. And that was only the first course!Then it was Lobster To Hotate. Poached Lobster and Hokkaido Scallop served with Sweet and Sour Dashi Broth. The Lobster and Scallop were firm and succulent, absorbing all the wonderful aromatic dashi broth. Delicious. It was so good my wife decided to slurp it all down. When no one was looking for course.Next we had Teriyaki Buri - Seasoned Hokkaido Yellowtail served with Braised Radish and Sweet Soy. Not that you'd be surprised. But it was sumptuous.Next on the menu was Karage - Deep Fried Chicken with Balsamic Mayonnaise. I know you'd be wondering if a common street food warranted a place on the Omakase menu. Well it was. Unlike the ubiquitous ones you find on the streets or certain Japanese restaurants here, Chef Kaz's version was crispy yet light, full of flavour without the sinful oiliness. There were 3 pieces available and I thought there weren't enough!The fifth dish was Gyudon - Japanese Rice served with Beef and Seasonal Truffle. The beef was firm and sweet, whilst the truffle added perfume and texture to the dish. Hardly surprising that it's one of the chef's signature dish. The final dish was desserts. No, there wasn't nary a mochi ice cream in sight. And thank goodness for that. Instead of one, we broke the Omakase law and ordered all 3 on the menu - Blue Cheese Ice Cream served with Walnut & Honey, Butter Chocolate Mousse with White Miso Cream, and Shiso and Plum Wine Sorbet served with Grape and Pineapple Sauce. While they were all admittedly heavenly, the star of the dessert show was the Blue Cheese Ice Cream with Walnut and Honey. Rich, robust, sweet, crunchy; simply divine.It was worth every cent we paid. The service was good, the food even better. So thank you Chef Kaz and everyone who served us. We had a blast indeed!And in true Japanese fashion, it was definitely worth a shout of "Gochisousama deshita"

We went for dinner recently and had the Omakase for S$125++ per pax which I thought was very good value for money considering the ingredients used and served were very good stuff - certainly not cheap stuff. The lobster and scallop thing was very good, as was the foie gras. The beef bowl was just brilliant. The chicken karage was also brilliant. The saba was above average, but I wasn't blown away. My least favourite dish was the vegetable thingy - but that said, I'm not a vegetable person and I did return an empty dish. The desserts were interesting - the chocolate mousse was good, the chilli ice cream was very interesting (although it's not something I would order again). The alcohol was a bit pricey though.It was good enough that I returned on two other occasions for lunch in the next week - the Shirasi bowl was pretty good and the beef bowl was good (I got them to add the truffles like the dinner bowl - just pay the extra). If you order the chicken karage bowl, ask them to serve the chicken separately outside otherwise it simmers inside the bowl and is not crispy anymore. I feel that the omakase dinner was a lot better value for money as compared to the lunch

Came here with some friends recently for the set lunch. Quality of food and service is very good and it's an interesting location in Club St. Alcohol prices aren't cheap: prepare to pay if you want to sample the selection of sakes. Definitely would visit here again for lunch
