Dinner with family. Very refreshing way of serving salad and sushi. You can customize or order standard items on the menu. 4 pax for less than $40. Definitely worth a visit.

Selected all my favourite fillings for the maki, tasted super delicious, but the portion is not alot so its not for main meals

Take a paper and simply fill up the boxes with what u like!
9.90 for their mega San it's just simply awesome and it's filling just for me!
Don't miss trying!

I would not recommend this place to anyone who enjoys real makis. It's just random ingredients rolled into rice. We tried four different makis and none of them were tasty. You might as well go for a salad for fresher ingredients.

we can add everything we want to eat .we can order Qoo heaven and earth green tea and heaven and earth ice lemon tea

The main selling point is their maki which comes in a roll and you get to choose what is inside. Fully customization and although it may cost about SGD10+, I assure you it is going to be a full meal. You can go with some sides to share, but I do not think you can finish too much.The quality is ok, but the rolls tend to fall apart though, which is why I took off 1* from the review. It becomes a bit hard to eat when you are mobile actually.

Since I work nearby, I have tried a wide variety of the mix & match sushi and so far it's all good. You just need to get the correct sauces and match.Salads are awesome. Fresh and easy to pick your favourites.Chawanmushi and soup isn't bad. It's tasty.Service wise is fast and prompt. Staffs are polite. But of course there are times when it takes a while to prepare and the staff can be a bit moody. But hey, no one is perfect.Great for tea-breaks, simple lunch and dinner or just to munch while catching up with your friends, colleagues or partners

Though this place doesn't serve the traditional kind of 'maki', their version is still yummy! You can either D.I.Y your own or choose from the menu.Though it is a little pricey considering the sashimi they give is not a lot, it is still worth it. The service is fast and efficient. Their packaging is also very cute and has a lovely design. (Probably why it is priced that way) The fish I ordered was salmon sashimi, fresh but can't really taste it due to the other ingredients in the maki. Wish the salmon was in a bigger quantity so it doesn't get overwhelmed

love the DIY salad and sushi. being a selective eater, i love it when i can customise my food. wide variety of ingredients to choose from to create your own salad bowl or sushi. grab the order chit and tick your preferences. proceed to cashier to pay. waiting time is reasonable since they craft each order from scratch. gotta be a little patient during peak hours. there are also pre-concocted house salads and sushi and other side dishes. DIY salads are $7.90, $9.90, $11.90. DIY sushi come in 2 sizes $7.90 and $9.90. difference being the combination of ingredients. limited seats though

I imagine it's like a DIY salad bar but for maki! You choose your wraps, type of rice, protein, sauce etc! Quite a novelty and can't wait to go back and try the different combinations. The tempura crunch adds a nice bite to your maki! Highly recommended

Love the concept of getting to customize my own sushi
It is reasonably priced and their miso soup is also quite nice

I had a California Dreaming sushi, but doesn't taste like "California" at all except for Avocado. I saw the picture in the shop and I thought I could have salmon and Ikura...But it turned out to be quite disappointed...

A great usual quick or takeaway meal for us, since we stayed nearby. It is usually crowded but the wait is bearable, because you would roughly know the number of people before you and how long the wait might be. Recently, our experience was kind of disappointing due to the influx of delivery services. From the point of queuing to payment and finally getting my takeaway, there were actually 5 different delivery pick ups at the outlet. Until 35min later, I managed to have my order called

Love the choices. Actually too many to choose from. Spoiler alert: they fry your sushi if you want it to be a little bit different. Me and him chose the diy sushi wrap. Love the packaging. Wishing that it could be made from a recycled material or being given a token of appreciation after giving back the packaging. A pity to be thrown away after. Anyway back to the food, its not a typical sushi if u want it to be. Its more of california maki. So it will filled you up quickly. Good to share and exchange amongst friends and family. Mind you, theres other side dishes to consider if sushi does not satisfy your palate. The squid tempura, the tempura batter was good but sad, the squid is neither sweet nor tasty. Bland unless dipped into the wasabi mayo. All in all, great quick meal. But beware of the long queue. A popular choice amongst the young

Long queue but service so efficient I had my food within a couple of minutes. Make sure to get your order card so that you can hand in your completed order when you reach the till. I had a fully customised mega maki-san sushi roll. It came in a box with a gorgeous print of enoki mushrooms. If this place did merch, I would have bought all of it. Great that you get so many options without the price changing (9.90 Singapore dollars for the large sushi). 8 pieces. Totally satisfied afterwards. Staff are not super friendly but they are there to be efficient which they are extremely good at; like a well oiled machine. Loved the vibes from the decor itself. All the posters are terrific! Do check out what the sauce of the month is. Delicious and bespoke sushi for a great price.

I had the one at Katong I12 for delivery to my place over at the east. The serving eas served in generous portion and loved my DIY sushi. For those who dont want the trouble of cracking your brain what to include in your suhi, there is their own theme of sushi. Ofcourse eating at the outlet is better as served warm if you select warm/hot. But for delivery, it served alright. Not warm nor cold, perfect room temperatue. I enjoyed my DIY sushi thanfully! :

Enjoyed with my friends on a weekend after a movie. It was crowded, there is little seating place. Interior design were interesting. Their staffs were pretty young. I wouldn't say they are slow, as is a weekend; but waited quite a while. Services would say is average, room for improvement. There should be more direction as to where the queue is, where to be seated or where to start, we taken sometime to figure out.

The concept of Maki-San sounds interesting so my cousin and I decided to purchase 2 sets of Sushi Mega San takeaway. The service was ok and the waiting time for the food is not too long. The presentation of the food is really pretty and neat. However, the quality of food is really bad:1. Japanese rice is of substandard, overcooked resulting in mashy texture, dry and lack of the usual sushi rice seasoning 2. Jelly fish is not seasoned so other than giving a little crunchy texture, it is tasteless 3. Prawns used are those tiny cooked frozen ones that you may find in supermarket. Not those Ebi standard type of prawn, and it is tasteless again. Guess they simply defrost and use it as it is4. Avocado used is fresh thou but we can hardly taste it as it is too little 5. Chicken used is breast meat and again, no seasoning so it is hard and tasteless6. Smoked duck is fine but the amount is really pathetic 7. Tempura enoki mushroom is fine but the tempura is a little soggy 8. Pine nuts are roasted and still crunchy thouAnyway, my verdict is, it is definitely not worth the price $19.80 for 2 sushi. There is hardly any cooking skill in it and if you expect their sushi to taste "Japanese", you will be disappointed. They ought to improve their quality of ingredients and cooking skills, else I doubt they will last long

Went to the outlet at The Arcade at Raffles Place. Decent set-up where you can choose to make your own sushi/salad or opt for the available mixtures called the House Sushi. You need to fill out a form choosing which ingredients you want and the attendants will make it for you on the spot. Great variety to choose from and tasty too. There are 2 sizes to choose from - The little san and mega san.I went for a little san salad and a little san Very Veggie sushi roll (vegetarian for the girlfriend). Needless to say she loved it and I was quite satisfied with the salad.Would recommend to take-away than sit there to eat as there was very less space to sit. The attendant at the counter was helpful and the service was fast although I ordered just before a large group came for their sushi fix.So, Pros are- A DIY sushi with large amount of ingredients to choose from, - 3 types of wraps to choose from and a choice of brown rice- A good, quick lunch to satisfy your sushi cravingCons :- You might have to wait a while if you go during lunch time as it is popular with the office crowd at Raffles- Might be slightly on the pricier side (but then which sushi place isnâ€™t?

A simple sushi bar that serves rolls and salads made with fresh, quality array of ingredients, it is no wonderment that Maki-San is favourable amongst our desire for healthier choices of food these days. What is best is that you can also choose to customise your own sushi or salad, picking your very own ingredients from the wide variety available here.Pretty boxes are given for all sushi rolls; and the service here is definitely very affable.*Charmaine's sushi roll was made with white pearl rice, omelet, avocado, salmon sashimi, salmon roe etc, and tasted better than much.Mine consisted of brown rice, crabmeat, asparagus, salmon roe, tangerine orange wedges and cranberries. Yes, an attempt at being healthy. It was huge so I only tried a couple of rolls - packed the rest back and the family members loved it.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/08/media-invite-maki-sans-3rd-birthday.htm
