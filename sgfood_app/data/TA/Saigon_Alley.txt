Great Vietnamese food and a very affordable price (lunch set menu around S$9).
Try the soups, salads, sandwiches... everything is so yummy!
The space is a little limited if you are thinking about having a big group meal, otherwise, should be ok.

I was recommended the place a while ago but could not find an opportunity to go to Novena area. Finally manged to go there for lunch with a friendFood is good, really tasty, and prices are really affordableYou can find usual Vietnamese dishes, nothing extraordinaryStaff is friendly and welcoming, service is quite goodHad to wait a bit for the main dish (pho)(4 is probably overrated but 3 would not have been fair

I highly recommend this place. I was here with a friend for dinner and without exaggeration everything we ordered was full of flavour and super well balanced. We had the crab rolls and beef salad to start followed by the Australian and spicy beef pho. We topped it all off with a gin and tonic each. Price wise it was extremely reasonable for the quantity and quality of the dishes. The place itself has an authentic feel to it with graffiti and other decoration on the walls and the staff are very pleasant, friendly and attentive

My wife read good reviews on this place and it's authentic Vietnamese cuisine, so we decided to give it a try on New Year's Day. The Phos with Australian beef and chicken are really good! we ordered 2 sets of these which came with fresh summer rolls which is value for money. For dessert, we had the ice cream with coffee jelly and this was nice too. the coffee was strong

You could be excused for being drawn into Saigon Valley by its graffiti walls and pretty lighting. Unfortunately, the food is lacks the colour of its walls. When one tries to 'refine' street food like noodles and banh mi, you risk ending up with a paler version of the real stuff and this is one of those places. It doesn't help that service is spotty -- half our order was forgotten without a proper apology after nearly an hour's wait and the restaurant wasn't even busy. What did arrive took way too long and was not something I could recommend in good conscience, having tried much better versions of Vietnamese food in Singapore. There is therefore no reason to visit Saigon Valley, not even if you really need the bathroom, since that department too is sorely needing a spruce up

I found here at the sundaytimes of ST.Feature is pair of Sakadaru, huge alcohol tank for Japanese Sake.It's not looks vetnames restaurant.We had lunch here, beef salad and noodl lunch set.Both taste good, especially beef of beef salad is excellent because surface was well cocked but inside was almost raw so called 'Tataki'.We also tried dessert banana ice cream and coffee Jerry.It's taste good too. Cut coffee jerry small and mixed with ice cream.Here alcohol served by next bar, beer is good and line up many foreign beer but a it expensive. It is no choice in Singapore
