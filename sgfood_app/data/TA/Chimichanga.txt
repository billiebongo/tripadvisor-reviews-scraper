Great atmosphere with a wide selection of affordable food and drinks. Hands down best frozen lime margaritas (1-1 @ $16) on Mondays. Had an amazing time there with my friends drinking and eating our monday blues away!

The atmosphere is chill and relaxed.
The food is great.
There are oysters on Mondays and Live Lobsters on Saturdays too!

Lunch sets were value for money at 10 nett inclusive of a drink. We enjoyed our burrito and quesadilla

As a sucker for authentic laid back places, I stumbled upon this place while rummaging through the streets of Dunlop street - Singapore's last few bohemian enclaves.Kudos to the owners for bringing about a certain raw energy that soothes the soul. Was greeted by a long old wooden table upon entry, and was glad to find out that it was a part of an old pontoon from yesteryears.Food quality and taste is beyond expectation especially with very affordable prices. Must have with some ice cold Coronas. Will be back.

Love the colours and the vibe of the place. Makes for a great after-work hangout. Service is friendly and food is good.

The restaurant was decked out well, cool vibes and awesome posters! Food was average at best, and some of the dishes could be served warmer!
5
The ambience is fun, and during lunch time it doesn't get too crowded. Lovely food, amazing service!

Great food, cozy ambience, awesome service. Love their fish tacos. A great place to hang out with friends for a drink or more

Food was very average not worth the walk and the service was very bad. Half the items on the menu were unavailable. Average experience
5
Love the fish tacos and the chicken taquitos! Beers are just $6. Our bill has never crossed $100 for a casual night out with lots of food and drinks.
5
food was good and flavourful, we had fish and pork tacos alongside with nachos with beef. great atmosphere. it wasn't too noisy so it's a good place to have conversations

I made a reservation for 5 but did not get my seats when I got to the restaurant. Drinks took so long to be prepared and they ran out of a lot of items on the menu.

A hidden find somewhere in little india - nearest station will be the downtown line Rochor. Though the menu doesn't have sangria, the food portion and taste is awesome! Happy hour until 7pm. Love the range of mexican dishes here and each dish is around $8 to $10. GST and Service charge is not included in the bill (extra plus points!). Love the chicken wings and tacos! Been here twice and will make it back again

I'm a big fan of Mexican food and Chimichanga turned out to be a lovely accidental encounter while strolling along Little India. Prices were very reasonable and I loved the dive-bar vibe! Great live music and affordable Mexican food â€” I look forward to trying out the rest of the menu!
