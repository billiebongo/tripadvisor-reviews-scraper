For a wide selection of exotic Asian (Singaporean, Malaysian, Indonesian, Indian, Chinese) dishes, at good prices with a great atmosphere enjoying their dinner, look no further than the Albert Centre. Food quality is ok, but have been to better hawker food centres in Singapore.
5
They only have a soup, no other plate. But it is worthwhile queuing for that $ 5.5 soup. We where 3 times there, and always had to queue.
3
We arrived there about 6:30pm half the stalls were closed, had the Laksa wasn't the best I have ever had, guess you get what you pay for. Tried to find a beer couldn't though to be honest didn't look beyond a 2 minute walk around.Have been to meeting hawker centrers/eating places in Singapore and Asia this didn't impress

I always like hawker food because it reflects the true local taste of my country. Whether it is fish ball noodle, starchy luo mee noodles or Indian `rojak or hainanese chicken rice, these local food in the hawker centers are extraordinary appetizing and reflect the unique food culture of Singapore. Firstly, the rental of hawker centers are subsidized by government and the stallholders are to sell their food at reasonably price and thus they are value for money. Secondly, whatever profits go directly to the hawkers themselves and you are indirectly helping the ordinary Singaporeans living a decent livelihood. Albert Centre hawker center is located at the busy Bugis Junction in Waterloo Street. Despite stiff competition from restaurants, café and eateries, it is always crowded. It is ideally located between Bugis Junction and the Guan Yim Buddhist Temple with many hotels. At lunchtime, I had to hunt for my seat as most seats are occupied. Office workers working at nearby buildings and tourists flooded the food center. Queues are seen at some of the stalls like the starchy luo mee noodles, the fish ball noodles and the nasi lemak stalls. The price is reasonably cheap at $2/- to $2.50/- and that could have attracted the crowd. I found the starchy noodles', the spicy laksa and the nasi lemak' not bad. The fish ball noodles sold at $2/- is a bit less in the volume but the fish balls are quite a number. I observe many come for the Indian curry noodles or the nasi bryani or the tonic soup even though they are a bit of expensive. There is also a stall selling dessert and I found the business was good. All in all it is value for money. The only thing the hawker center needs to improve is the cleanliness of the tables and the `harassment' of the pigeons. Early morning I came here and I already found the table full of unclear plates and utensils. At lunch, the situation is even worse. The hawkers themselves must bear responsibility to ensure that the tables are maintained clean at all times. If they just focus on their business and ignore the cleanliness, I think it is time NEA should take some action. I saw pigeons flying into the food center to eat the leftover. Pigeon's droppings can carry bacteria and virus that may cause meningitis and effort should be made to ensure cleanliness of the tables and means to prevent the pigeons from entering the food center. Overall, the hawker center impressed me with the wide varieties of food and are value for money

We stopped at this hawker centre whilst on a walking tour. This seemed to be more of a ‘local’ hawker centre so was less busy but the food was really nice and very cheap and the hawker centre itself was very clean.I tried a Laksa for 2.50SDG which was OK. I have yet to find an outstanding Laksa in Singapore compared to some I have had in Melbourne. My husband and son tried the nasi lemak with fried chicken for 2.50SDG and they said it was better than the one they had at the Maxwell Food Centre. We also tried a fish and noddle soup for 3.00SDG which was also nice and got the usual kopi coffee and lime juices for 1.30SDG each. You have to keep trying the lime juices as everyone I had in Singapore was different.If we were staying in Bugis we would have eaten here again
4
This large Hawker's Centre is in a open sided building so you are protected from the rain. There are countless stalls of food to choose from. They all seemed to have pictures of the food displayed and most had descriptions in English. We were staying in an Air BnB apartment nearby so we ate here several times. Sometimes we took the food back to the apartment so we could eat in the comfort of air conditioning. The food was good and extremely cheap. About $4 USD for the two of us
4
I stopped here a few times on my 4 day trip to Singapore. I was staying at the Mercure Bugis, 2 minute walk away. There are plenty of options for all kinds of SE Asian foods and mostly locals eating there. I had Char Siew Rice at one place which was very tasty and only $2 SGD, can't beat that. I also had some beers a couple of times. It's fun to hang out and watch the comings and goings of the food stalls and also the people going into Bugis+. The beers are around $7 SGD for a large bottle which is a pretty good deal in Singapor
4
This Food courts is across the backside of Jalan bugis market. Lot of tasty foods here with very friendly cost.Moslem travelers may find one full block of the halal food counters in here. There are separated with non halal located on the far side from bugis. The courts with various choice from asian, malay, indian and arabic foods
5
Every type of local food you could possibly want! Indian, Chinese,Malay. Our favourite was the Malay stall! The tastiest satay and the lady who runs it is a hoot! The Indian place next door also brilliant. It’s not aimed at tourists and this is why it’s a favourite for me. It’s pure local food! Till 2019
4
This is a textbook example of a food market / food court where you will find every imaginable kind of (South East) Asian food, and quite a few you couldn't even have imagined. It may not be The Greatest Food Court in the world, but it's pretty dang good, with excellent choice, and excellent value for money. If you're into Asian food, you will literally think you've die and gone to food heaven - in which case, I challenge you to have just one (or two) dishes, as the temptations are endless. :)PS: Always a good sign (IMO), that 99% of the customers are natives.PPS: Always a good way to choose the food stand - look for the longest queue
4
Tried the fish ball noodles...rice cake and porridge. And the deserts are delicious too. However...generally hawkers in spore are quite grumpy...
4
Another good place to eat.in the heart of bugis neighboohood. Crowded but good experince.variety of foods.
4
Rows and rows of stalls offering all kinds of foods, drinks and snacks at cheap prices.
I stay in a hotel nearby and this place is my go to for food and drink rather than the restaurants.
4
Don't expect anything but a good local dish for a reasonable price. Actually is better then average but not very good so what do I chose? Well, very good, as the local cooks, mostly husband and wife I guess, do there best and fast.

This hawker Centre was closed recently for one month in June for minor repairs & redecorations.I still visit this place regularly. But since my last review one year ago, I noticed quite a number of new stalls has replaced some old ones. Its normal for this to happen in all hawker centres here.Take note also that since the June redecorations, locations of some stalls have changed. So if you don't find your favourite or recommended stalls, don't despair. It could be on another side.Foodwise, this is still the best place for good & cheap local food in the Bugis area. Spot the "long queues" as a visual guide to the good food stalls. But then "popular" stalls do not always serve the best food.Instead, if it looks good - just try it! After all, you won't know unless you try.

Love locals Foods. Be prepare to search for seats before searching for foods. No seat no food. Found seats but be prepare for unclear tables. So you can either clear on your own or wait for the friendly cleaner to clear for you. Do say thank you. What's nice?Fish ball noodles which is cheap and filling for your stomach during lunch hours. They do serve nice Claypot rice and even Indon food. Try the black fried noodles or carrot cake which is nice tooFor hot weather of Singapore, remember to have some dessert which is at the front side of the hawker.
4
If you're looking to try some classic Singaporean hawker fare, this food centre in an excellent place to start. This large venue is home to many stalls operated by locals who are veterans hawkers. Many of the recipes date back decades, ingredients are still handmade and flavors are authentic. We particularly enjoyed the Yong Tau Foo, fried dough stick, pan-fried chive dumplings, and desserts like soy bean curd, peanut soup and Tau Suan.
5
I have been eating at this place (specifically Mohamed Jaleel's Roti Canai stall) since 1989 and it has never lost it's local, unpretentious air. With the whole Waterloo St and Bugis scene nearby, along with the the handy OG department store, the Bencoolen precinct is in many ways a super-convenient place to start any trip to Singapore and then other parts of Asia - and you get to experience a homely side of Singapore that's not always on display.Love it
5
Visited this place a couple of time during our visit to Singapore. Plenty of locals here. You will will be spoiled for choices as there are a lot of food stalls to choose from. We would usually order from the stalls with queue and we were not disappointed.
4
If you are a foodie and want to try the very local cuisine then I would recommend this place. The food is fresh and really delicious. The variety can range from Cantonese cuisine to Malay and very Singaporean. You have a lot of options to choose. There are a number of options for drinks as well. Barley drink is always my favourite and radish cake always on the list of much eat
5
Albert Food Center is a great breakfast joint. Come early when it's more relaxed & grab a seat on the sunny leafy side by Queen St. Rice Garden, 'great meals for a good cause,' is awesome.
4
Many nice stalls here.. generally like wat other said, follow the q and u cannot go wrongTried the 百年 soup vermicelli yong tau foo, really nice n fresh.. popiah is nice alsoPointersWear light clothing as it's hot here...Bring tissues n wet ones if u want to clean the tables or your hands etcCleanliness is generally good hereCheap food
5
Loved the Albert Centre, which was very close to where we were staying. The variety and extremely low prices was fabulous. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. It's a must! We tried a really wide variety of food. My kids loved seeing the roti being made. Be prepared for a queue for the fried carrot cake (btw, it's not made with carrots as we know them, but radish and egg, and is delicious)
5
Follow the lines and you won't be disappointed. Locals come here and it starts getting crowded around 11:45 for lunch hour. There's so many options, there must be something for everyone. The place is clean, but if you're asking yourself too many questions about how they clean then just stay away. I have yet to be sick from any of the hawker centres I tried in SG. I miss it already; can't recommend any particular vendor, but just go with where the lines form which is what I did. Solo or a group; shouldn't be too difficult to find a seat. I did notice in most hawker centres there's a washing sink area which is separate from a bathroom (which you may have to pay for, 10-50 cents). Bring wet-wipes anyway which will help you battle the humidity of Singapore as you're walking outside. Some locals like to conveniently wash their mouth here after the meal, which at first was a bit uncomfortable to hear and watch; but I guess it grows on you after your second visit
4
This outdoor eating place is where the locals would go for them quick meals. Every stall cooks fresh ala minute and price is reasonable local price with so many choice!! It can be difficult to find a seat, avoid lunch time 12-2pm and 6-8pm. All stalls are self-service, so it's best to go with a Friend, one gets the food and the other keeps the seats!! My Favourite is Chwee Kueh..so cheap and so tasty!
2
Had to came here after thinking to try some local dishes and considering how near it is to our hotel (and how starving we were). Quite a lot of food stalls to choose and it was also quite crowded. It looks like this place is popular among locals since it was not easy to get an empty table to sit at 2 PM on a Friday afternoon. Ordered some nasi lemak ($2.50 only) & the nasi (rice) was surprisingly pretty good. Food on other people's table also looked interesting. However the place could've been cleaner. Apparently they don't have enough people to clean up tables. Still, a lot of people didn't seem to mind as they seemed really enjoying their food.If you want to taste some local dish with affordable price & wouldn't mind the cleanliness of the place, then this can be a place to go
4
If you find a long queue of people at any food stall, the food must be good. Place your order and they will cook on the spot and immediately serve you piping hot. Therefore food from the food centre are equivalent good, tasty and the price is reasonable
5
Like so many of Singapore's hawker centers, some of the best food we had can be found here. And the cheapest, as you can buy a dish for $3-6 singaporean dollars, and drinks are $1-3.50. Hard to pick a favorite stall. All kinds of Asian food, many of it comfort food - Indonesian dishes, cantonese, chicken and rice, fishball soups, noodle dishes, vegetarian, and on and on. One guy makes dishes fresh to order on a huge flaming wok (we like the mie goreng here, but honestly, anything out of a hot wok tastes good), dumplings were yummy, popiah stand converted us to popiah lovers, and the dessert stands are marvelous (try the chendol, the grass jelly drinks, the soymilk, the fruit shakes, the green bean soup). In the morning, lines are long for the peanut congee and fried noodles, the black carrot stir fry is yummy, there are yam cakes too. We had some of the best chinese donuts (you tiaos) ever and some of the best congee of all. Everything is homemade and fresh, as you can see them patting out the dough or rolling out the meatballs, etc, at the back of the tiny stands. Not all stalls are open at any given time, so you never know what you'll get when you show up. We opted for hawker food over restaurant food any day, and it was never the wrong choice. Don't be dissuaded by the chaos and griminess - it's really some of the best food you'll have in Singapore. A few tips:1. Stake your claim on a table first (one under a fan is nice), and then canvass for food 2. Bring lots of tissues, there are no napkins anywhere to be found3. Handy to have some small bills ($2, $5, $10) as it is so cheap, though they are able to give change when needed4. When you are done, leave dirty dishes at the table as there are staff who will bus the table, but there are also tray return areas if you want to bus it yourself. They have some kind of system where the right bowls and utensils are returns to the right stalls
4
I have my meals at albert centre quite often as it has a good selection of local delights. Fried carrot cake will always be in my order list. With Uncle's smiley face, though the queue and waiting time is kinda long, you will not feel any surge of anger at all. You get the best chwee kueh from the stall which sells it solely, and of course... not forgetting Bai nian (百年)， personally i feel that they have the tastiest & healthiest niang dou foo in their sweet soup broth .. no selections needed, just let them know if you want a $4/ $5 bowl, with or without bittergourd, don't forget to get their chilli for dipping...Yummy
4
If you are looking for an authentic Singapore dining experience, this is the place. Forget the food courts of Singapore's shopping centres. There are so many varieties of food offered you are spoilt for choice.The only downside is that the halal options are very limited and the portions offered by most stalls are rather small
4
Kings street Centre has a Hawkah and around the outside has markets. The markets are for true Singaporean people which gives you an idea of local life

All the food shows on TV talk about the great Hawker Centers in Singapore. I had read that Albert was a good one, and as I was exploring the Bugis area, I decided to give it a try. I have always followed the policy that the place with the longest line is the place from which I should buy my food. So I got in the longest line. Unfortunately, that place was not serving chicken rice. So I went to the place with the SECOND longest line, and that was the place for chicken rice.I have had chicken rice from several vendors in Singapore, and this was as good as I had anywhere. For the uninitiated, chicken rice is strips of boiled or stewed chicken, a mound of rice, some stewed vegetables and a bowl of broth. For SG$3.50, it was a very filling meal. They offered two sauces, chili sauce and "brown" sauce, which was indeed brown. I chose the brown sauce. This is a delicious dish, and if very spicy food is not your thing, then chicken rice (without the chili sauce) is a wonderful way to sample the cuisine of Singapore. And the Albert Hawker Center is a good choice
4
This is probably the best place in Bugis Street area for wide choices of good & cheap local food. Always come here when at Bugis Street area.It's a local "hawker" food centre, similar to those in nearby Chinatown area ( ie Hong Lim Complex/Chinatown Complex).Fusion: Fried carrot cake stall ( Guan Kee)- this item comes in either white or black version. Preferred white as Black is quite sweet.However, the friendly owner offers 'Fusion' option ie you can have a mix of part white/part black. Creative idea, so customers can try both versions without buying 2 different sets.Take note of following: 1. Quite a number of stalls are closed either on Monday or Tuesday (restdays).2. Must avoid lunchtime (about 12-2pm) as super crowded with offices staff. Can't get seats. Queues very long.Many stalls are closed after lunch, in mid afternoon.3. Most stalls are closed during dinner time. No point coming here during dinner. Go to Chinatown for dinner instead.4. Every 3 months ( ie Mar/June/Sept/Dec), this food centre will be closed for 3 days of routine washing/cleaning. Banner informing this is put up about 2/3 weeks or so in advance. Same as with the food centres in Chinatown area
5
The Albert street food plaza, is a wonderful collection of variety which has come together from all parts of Asia, Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian, Malaysian, Philippines, Indian, its all here ! enjoy the variety of food styles here and for a fraction of the cost that you would pay in many of the local restauarnt
5
Best place to visit to buy dried food stuff -dried shrimps, ikan billis..... And the list goes on . Literally anything dried food stuff u need for cooking . Best place to visit too before Chinese New Year to get your goodies , prices is 1/2 of what u pay in big department stores . A must visit before CNY 
5
BaiNian is selling only Yong Tao Fu(NiangToufu) in soup or dry with sweet sources. They have standard choices of the Yong Tau Fu (7pcs) with 1 type of noodle, cost SGD4 only, unless you want to add on extra noodle or the stuffed. Delicious and like their soup very much. Went there on weekdays morning, only 2 or 3 people in queue.But, very long queue in weekend.Recently, they open 2nd stall at the behind of same place.So you can try see which stall is lesser people in queue
3
Did two separate breakfast at Albert Centre Food Court. Spoilt for choices in terms of variety as there are more than 80 different operators. Noticed two operators with long queue which means that the food should be good. Attempted the kon lo wan tan (dry noodles with wan ton) and Yong Tau Fu. No regrets at all.
5
We visited here on our first night in Singapore and enjoyed some delicious local food at ridiculously cheap prices.It was nice to be able to begin our trip having dinner in a nice street food setting with only other local people eating there also.We would recommend it to anyone looking to get excellent value for money
4
A short walk from Bugis Junction, the Albert Hawker food centre is a great place to get cheap eats, Chinese, Japanese, Malay etc etc. Fruit Smoothies I love so a big mug of Banana smoothie went down a treat. Also sugar cane juice, yumm. Also the adjoining markets have tourist stuff as well as clothes and nearly anything you could want. If you love markets this is the place to be in Downtown Singapor
4
If you want a wide variety of tasty food for very little money then you must try eating at a hawker market. The food was very good, we had crispy seafood noodles char kway diew and veges stir fried with sambal paste all cooked fresh in front of you. The only thing I won't take a chance on in any hawker market is shellfish but we had prawns which were excellent. The high volume of patrons tells you it's good, if you want to eat what the locals eat this is it. Beware, it is hot inside, there is no air conditionin
4
A local food centre nearby Bugis station. A lot of famous & delicious food stalls. If you love noodle, your should try "百年" Bai Nian Yong Tau Foo. Soup and dumpling are so yummy at very budget price.
5
Decent foods. Many variations. Sweet carrot cake is worth to try. Go round the whole foodcourt to found stall with cheapest price (same food, different price)
4
Super close to our hotel (ibis bencoolen), and cheap delicious food! We're a family of four and split into two groups to explore and find food. I chose some Cantonese porridge with meatballs - I saw many locals eating from their stall. It was very hot but easier to eat once it cooled. As others say, bring tissues and/or wet wipes to wipe a table space, especially at lunch time as the whole place is busy. My porridge came with fried bread and it was expensive at $S4 but tasty and fillin
4
This is a typical "Local" Hawker Food Centre where one can find very good varieties of different local tasty food at cheap prices. There are also dried sundries, etc on the higher floors. Location is good, just next to Bugis Street & across from Bugis MRT station.As with all similar food centres here, just buy your food & drinks and seat anywhere you like. It's easy to order as menu & prices are usually displayed at the stalls.Long queues at certain stalls do give indication of its popularity but does not necessary means it's good. Just be adventurous & try what you think looks good. Couple of things to take note though ( applies to other food centres too eg at Chinatown Complex, Hong Lim Complex, Maxwell Centre ).1. Although almost stalls display menu & prices, there are still some odd ones who don't. For such stalls, pls ALWAYS ask for prices first before you order. Especially if one is ordering "expensive items like fish." Check the prices before you proceed. Otherwise you may get a price shock when you are given your order.2. Be prepared. The environment won't be as nice nor comfortable as those in airconditioned foodcourts. But then remember that one is paying cheap prices here for good food. You are here for 'genuine' good local food; not cosy environment. 3. As mentioned by others, it is common for dirty tables not to be cleared that quickly. Especially during lunch time where cleaners just cannot cope. Bring wet issues/wipes to do a simple wipe & put the dirty plates/etc on nearby tray racks.4. It's normal to see few different prices stated on a single item eg $3/4/5 or $$2.50/$3.50/4.50. This basically means the item is available in few different 'sizes/ portions'.From my many years of experiences, I would recommend just order the cheapest size/portion. Because very often, there aren't really any significant differences for the bigger sizes/portions. So why pay more & waste your money.5. Best time to come is after 10 am as most stalls would have opened. However certain stalls may take longer due to their types of food. Avoid lunch time ( between 11.45-2.00pm) as it's extremely crowded & difficult to get a seat. Note it's common for many stalls to close after lunch. So if you come for dinner, expect only few stalls to be opened

I found this hawker market by chance on my last stop over in Singapore and so booked a hotel near it for this recent visit. The food is so cheap and freshly cooked. We paid about 11 S$ for three huge plates of stir fried pork, plate of delicious vegetables and sea food and noodles . A bowl of seafood laksa was S $2.5. My only tip is to take some wipes or paper napkins as it can get very busy and although the bowls and plates are clean the tables can be mucky as the is little time for them to be wiped. Rally recommended 
5
This is the place to go to for sea cucumbers, birds nest and other exotic dried goods. A must to wrangle. Chinese herbs such as American ginseng is also available; ask for them to be sliced. Downstairs lies an amazing hawker centre for Singapore dishes and durian!
4
The Albert Centre Food Hall backs onto Waterloo St near South East Asia Hotel and the OG Dept Store It consists of over 100 food and drink stalls from which purchases can be made with tables and seating provided for consumptionFood stalls offer a wide range of items at a very reasonable cost most of which is decent good food Initially we merely queued behind locals at stalls and had what they were ordering but later became more adventurous and tried other stalls that appealed although we did not always choose the cheapest stall A number of stalls sell drinks and peeled fresh fruit both of which we sampled many times One stall in particular Donalds made the best mango milk shake I have ever had While doing so he tells your fortune based on shape and size of your ears A popular milk shake was an avocado one which seems a little strange but is quite good The food hall is kept clean by teams of cleaners and overall the quality of the food and drink was good at bargain pricesIn the several floors above the food hall are things such as clothing alterations dry food nuts etc suppliers grocery type stalls chemists etc all substantially cheaper than elsewhere Well worth wandering through I had a zip replaced there for $4At the front of the food hall is the very large Bugis Street marketBeside the food hall is the area where all the tri cycle rickshaws are keptdept Stor

Sometimes you just want good, cheap food. Street food. No pretense. Plastic utensils and trays are just fine, as long as the food is amazing.Albert Food Centre was close to the hotel and we were out shopping for the cheap gifts you bring home to friends and family. Follow the crowd. If the line is long, then that is the stall to stop at.The food was spicy, plentiful, quick and cheap. It was ideal for a hot and steamy evening of shopping. Grab a cold one and soak in the atmosphere. Very highly recommend
4
This is one of those hawker centers to get to early, 11:15 for lunch. Just follow the lines, this is the best indication for good food. Got some excellent Rojak, freshly prepared batch by batch. Airy place and semi clean. Lots of other food options around
4
We had a 14-hour stopover in Singapore and wanted to experience one of Singapore's famous hawker centres. This one seemed popular with locals and the prices were cheap for what you get. Have a wander through the centre first and look to see where the locals are as this is normally an indication of quality. We probably got there a bit late.....around 8pm...some places were closing or had sold out of their most popular items.....but there was still plenty open and lots to choose from.Definitely worth a look!
4
This place is near our hotel so this was our go-to place for cheap yet very delicious food. It's a bit tricky to grab a table during the lunch and dinner rush though, but the wait is worth it.
4
This place will seriously provide you with very reasonably priced food in the city area. There's so many stalls and they'll leave you spoilt for choice! However, the hawker center is fairly dirty, but still not too bad given that most hawkers are similar.
4
The food is quite good with a reasonable price. I have went there continuously two days for my lunch!
Ground floor is food stalls and wet market and upper floor is a wholesale market.
5
There are variety of food to choose from in a single visit after a walk at Bugis Street. Many noodles and plates starts from $2SD up. Bak Kut Teh is a must try Singaporean local soup.
4
I visited the kwan im temple nearby and had the breakfast in Albert food centre. Value for money with variety of food choice but do not expect too much.
5
If you are looking for cheap but delicious Singapore cuisine then look no further. There is a huge array of choices here. As soon as my husband and I set foot here we knew the food must be good as it was packed full of locals. I would advise not to just buy at the first stall you see, but to take your time walking around each stall to see what types of food there are... but more importantly to see if there are queues or full tables around the stall. Coz if its empty - don't go to that stall, since theres a reason why the locals don't eat there. I had a stir fry chicken noodles and my hubby had a mixed meat curry with rice. Both were moreish and very tasty. During our week in Bugis we ate here the most due to its good selection. The stir fry beef ho fun (wide but thin noodles that are like the oriental version of tagliatelle) are also delicious. You can get beef, chicken, prawn or mixed meat/seafood ho fun. There is also a food court inside Bugis Junction shopping mall that has a selection of cuisines, but is a little bit more in costs. There are also plenty other food courts/eateries in the other smaller shopping centres in Bugis that are a much cheaper option than paying extortionate prices in the posher/fancy restaurants
3
I was only in Singapore for an evening and found this market full of Asian fast food vendors. Each dish is between like S$2.50- S$8 and very standard. I personally enjoyed the cheap vegetarian place with three veg dishes and rice for $2.50. There was also some fried carrot cake place that had a long que. Not bad for quick and dirty
2
This place had been described by hotel staff as shopping paradise, and since I am very much into shopping, if I can find something that they don't already sell back home that is, I went to have a look.The place is full of Chinese stalls and tiny shops selling cheap and not very pretty stuff, from clothes to souvenirs to shoes. The goods on offer do not generally appear to be of good quality, and I didn't feel very safe in those claustrophobic passages, although it was early afternoon.You will also find street food. I have never eaten any though, not here, not elsewhere, because I don't want to run the risk to get an exotic bug and spend the rest of my holiday in my hotel room
5
I have been eating here for years, and still love the place. This is the real Singaporean food, made by and for Singaporeans.Very few tourists venture in here, but more fool them - this is far, far better value for money than the cafes by the river. I love the satay most of all, but many of the stands have queues for a reason. Don't miss this place
4
Accross the road from bugis street markets good place to stop for a cheap lunch. It is a bit dirty as other reviews said but it is a hawker centre and they are all similar. Would recommend for people who are a bit adventrous and can handle a lot of people and a bit if dirt. Alot of good stalls - just go to the one's that have people in the line good indication if locals like it. I like this place meals for $2-3 however I would say China Town hawker centre blows this one out of the water but if you are shopping accross the road and are Hungary - great option.
3
Pork noodles $3.00, Chicken, vegetables & rice $2.80. Not bad at all. Thought it could be cleaner, but we were there late. Worth a try.
3
open till 9pm and even 9:30pm for a few stalls
as usual, ventilation at hawker centers like this is not good
4
Lots of choices to dine and try the the local Singapore- chicken rice and other delicacies.fromChinese to Malay, to Indonesian and Thai it sure suffices a lot of palates.
4
Location: centrally located with several tourist attractions nearby i.e Goddess of Mercy ( middle road)Food : wide variety of local foods i.e Rojak , yong tau foo, chicken rice , etc...Which food stalls to try: tips : look out for the long queue an indicator for good foodPrice: reasonable Lacking: non air conditioning but at least the air we breathe is free :) What else : dried food stalls and other home accessories and clothing store ( if looking for branded stuff this is not the place)Other tips: to avoid the heavy crowd best time to go is approx 6plus (evening) since the popular stall are still opened and but with shorter queue . After meal can visit the bugis street ( another tourist attraction ) just few meters always
4
If you stay at Bugis area, you must have breakfast at Albert Centre. It's like a big foodcourt, but everything is really cheap. I recommend having breakfast here as it's not so hot in the morning, as it'll be hot at lunchtime and afternoon. They have a range of shop stalls catering to different cuisines. Few of my favourites are: 1) roti canai / roti prata - about SGD$1.60 for a set of roti prata (2 pieces) + curry sauce 2) teh tarik / coffee - about SGD$0.90 each 3) popiah - about SGD$1.40 for 2 rolls 4) congee (jook) - about SGD$2-35) wanton noodles (dry) with bbq pork (char siew) and wontons - about SGD$2.50 for small or SGD$3 for large I recommend tourists to bring their own tissues or wet wipes as your hands or table can get dirty. Or there are a few sinks there for you to wash your hands.Alternate breakfast is at Bugis McDonalds (which is around the corner) which cost us SGD$15 for 2 sets of meals (for 2 people), which is expensive compared spending less than SGD$8 (for 2 people) at Albert Centre for breakfast

I love every minute that i spend here, and I dislike nothing at all ! Albert street plaza, a series of small eateries, all in rows of small shops, selling a wide variety of Asian cuisines, from Nepal in the north to Indonesia in the south and all the other countries from east to West. The prices are great, very economical, Cheap indeed, and the flavours make my mouth water. Today I got there early about 10.00 am and found half the place wqas closed and they were in the process of opening.It was like a large orchestra, tuning up for a magnificent concert ! I started off visiting those who had opened and then bought some freshly squeezed Lime juice from one, and then a Bee Hoon meal at another. The bee Hoon, was Rice, Chicken, two eggs, some greens, and of course some Chillie paste for $ 2.40 ( Singapore )i then got some Kopi ( coffee ) as only the Singaporeans do it in a large stainles steel coffee pot, into a cup and then topped up with water and condensed milk ! $ 1.20 ( cheap ) Starbucks are $ 4.50 !!!!I went off to Sim Lim building and bought a Flash unit for the camera and after an hour or so, came back for Lunch.This time, I had the freshly squeezed Sugar cane juice, some Noodles, greens and sweet and sour pork. I broke the bank on this one $ 3.00 including the drink !!!!Afterwards I got another Sugar cane juice and walked around, tomorrow..... back again for a great meal good conversation, and a great deal of the truly Singapore Culture.

The roti prata with mutton curry is fantastic. My son had food envy and ordered this as a 2nd breakfast. He had some chee Cheong fun which was tasty but not very filling. There's lots of variety but we never seem to get around to trying them a,, sticking to favorites. For tourists, the cleanliness is rated by A for the highest standard and B for the next level while C is just satisfactory. We always bring disinfectant wipes to clean off cutlery

Albert Centre Market & Food Centre is within walking distance (5 mins) from Ibis Singapore on Bencoolen and even closer (2 mins) from Bugis Street/Bugis Junction.Went here twice, both before 10am, and both times the place already had crowds. I think mostly locals visit this hawker centre.A variety of stalls selling prawn mee, nasi lemak, porridge/congee, rice with roasted chicken/duck, char kway teow, oyster omellete, carrot cake.We tried the nasi lemak (with fried egg, fried chicken wing, ikan bilis, stir fry long beans), prawn mee with pork ribs and fried Hokkien noodle. Each dish cost less than SGD 5, I think the nasi lemak was even less than SGD 3.If you're looking for a cheap, filling meal, in Bugis area, this place can be an alternative.Free seating, open air. Bring your own tissue/wet tissue, as the stall operators don't provide them, and the cutleries are often wet

I only saw one other confused tourist while I was here. The place was truly a local lunch haunt although not quite sure how since it's opposite bugis village. Eat here for less than s$3! I waited in line for 20 minutes for black carrot cake. EAT THIS!

European Disclaimer: if you like fancy & luxury restaurants, this is maybe not for you. If you are on the budget and want to taste real food, then it is place for you to go :) I felt safe and enjoyed the atmosphere...

Look for the line with the longest locals.
One will be the chicken rice stand and at only $2.50 a dish.

excellent value and close to Ibis hotel. several choices of vendor and styles of food including cheap tiger beer

many choices and unbelievably cheap - chicken rice, iced coffee, fried radish cakes, fried noodles, fried vermicelli..
turnoffs: wet cutleries

lots of choices, well kept, prices are incredible, ample sitting. Not too hot there also because of the numerous fans so very comfy for a great breakfast or lunch

It has about 50 stalls which offer varieties of Asian foods. There was an Indian stall which offers pirantas in the morning -excellent!

Good selection of local food. Not the cleanest of places but then this is where all the locals eat. Self service.
If you see a queue in front of the stall, the food there is most probably good.

Noisy, Oily, plenty to choose from......If you just wanna have your stomach full, come over to this place, eat & drink & just leave sooner.... Everything else is just the surrounding market. Close to OG Department Store, SimLim Electronic Market across the street. or Bugis Market...

The center is just opposite to our hotel and near to famous Bugis night Market. Lot of Stall and also found Indian Stall there. Food was dirt cheap from Singapore standard. smell of fish was all around the area hence being vegetarian did not enjoy much

I loved the food there. It's not only considered as cheap but most importantly, they are delicious. I had Kueh Chap, "Cui Kueh", chicken rice, big prawn noodles... and more actually. Very delicious. The only thing is you will need to find place to sit and it's more difficult if you're travelling in a big group. If solo, then there's no problem. Kindly just ask the people sitting there, if the empty space is free to be seated. Fresh sugar cane juice is also available. Remember to tell them no sugar added and less ice, so that you can taste the freshness of the sugar cane.
