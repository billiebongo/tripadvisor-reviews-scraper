You cannot go wrong at this place, if you want to try traditional kueh and of course also the dumplings. Love their Ondeh Ondeh, Bak Chang, Nonya Chang. They have a very large range of local traditional kueh.

Hidden above the restaurant, is a treasure throve of lovely hand painted batiks. There's a wide variety of kebayas that won't break the bank. Go for it.

Some of the Peranakan snacks and cakes are very good. The rest are just ok.
I like the pineapple tarts during Chinese New Year. Quite delicious.

Came here on the 3rd day of Chinese New Year and YES! They were open! I've lived in Katong a few years ago. There are quite a few Nyonya snack shops in Katong but Kim Choo has remained one of my favourite shops. With all due respect to my Malaysian friends, but I much prefer the taste of Singapore Nyonya snacks. It's a taste of Home I guess. I shop here for Kim Choo's Nyonya Kueh-Chang (rice dumplings, 娘惹粿粽), Ondeh-Ondeh (Coconut Sweet-potato Balls, 香椰番薯丸), Rempah Udang (Spicy Shrimp and Glutinous Rice Rolls, 香辣虾糯米卷) and Otak-Otak (Grilled Sugar-Palm Fish Parcels, "乌达"桄榔叶烤鱼包). You are also welcome to take a peak at Kim Choo's collection of Kebaya tops and Kasut Manek (Peranakan beaded slippers) and hand-painted Peranakan dishes. They make good travel souvenirs if have the budget. Exquisite Kasut Manek glass-beaded slippers are keepsakes.NOTE: Please do not confuse "Joo Chiat Kim Choo" with "Kim Choo". They are not related

Love the Nyonya Chang here! Bought a dozen normal size ones plus 3 boxes of the minis to bring to Bangkok for friends. They love it too! Taste is so heavenly and there's so much meat inside. The best!It would be great if you would sell frozen ones though. For people who want to store them or bring them overseas

Passable fare for a dumpling. Doesn't measure up to the hype the brand trumpets.Price-wise is reasonable, I guess.Having considered themselves as having set the bar in the bak chang realm, it will be hard for improvements to shine through unless Humpty Dumpty have a great fall

I'm very fond of the large pyramid-shaped banana-leaf wrapped rice dumplings and previously only knew to find good ones in the Hong Lim hawker centre. It seems the ones from here are quite famous and extremely good.I tried both the ones that have a mixture of pork/salt egg/ mushroom/ chestnut and also the Nonya style ones. If you haven't had these they are quite large - one is a large snack or light meal.N.B. On both visits (~8pm) it seemed like it was more of a take-away stall than a sit-in restaurant but I might have come at the wrong time

Went to buy some snacks for a friend.If not for the cakes and bak chang which are in my opinion nothing special...i wouldnt go near them.Staffs are rude and totally unfriendly.If they dont understand orders properly they will blame the customer and tell them to order it "this way" next time and not to confuse them.Next time??Really?

 I have always liked their Nonya snacks and tidbits. But yesterday, I went to buy a peanut ang ku kueh and the lady counter staff, without trying to confirm the filling, stuffed a piece to me and said it's peanut filling. I queried her but she insisted. When I bit into it, it wasn't. She was furious that I wanted a refund or exchange. After ignoring me for some minutes, she finally snatched it back and dumped in the bin, and gave me one with peanut filling. How unreasonable! I left the shop with no intention to return

Nice chang and otak but more expensive than others, although worth it if you are prepared to pay

My family has been buying CNY Goodies from Kim Choo's for the past few years and this year was no exception. Here is a review of what we bought :Pineapple Tarts : Good, not too sweet, pasty is moist and buttery.Love Letter Rolls : Excellent, has good lemak flavor, and not too burnt.Dried-Shrimp Rolls : Flavorful and Crispy, but could do with more filling.Corn-Flake Cookies : Sweet and Crunchy.Berlinjo Kropok : Excellent, very addictive.Also bought some Nonya Chang, which was excellent. Tried the XO Chang, which was crap

This was my first attempt to Peranakan food. I had Sambal Sotong and I really liked it. The service was swift and very friendly. But it's a pity the atmosphere in the restaurant is below all standards, decoration is corny, the music awfful, the lightning too schrill

We had dinner nearby (Perankan Inn - look out for that review) and we popped over to buy some kuehs + bak changs. It's strange that none of the reviews here mentioned anything about their kuehs since it's what they are known for. Anyway u have got to pay attention to the kuehs especially after 8pm. It's been super warm in Singapore lately and anything made with coconut milk/creme is bound to go bad after being displayed in the open for a couple of hours, not to mention for an entire day. The kueh kosui that I bought has gone bad (I ate some last night after dinner when I got home), & I didn't bother to try the ondeh ondeh. I just spoke to Susan on the phone (12pm the following day) and she has kindly agreed to give me a refund (they have a small outlet at ION Orchard B4). Still we might go back to Kim Choo for dinner (someday) .

This is definitely the most unforgettable peranankan food I have ever had. Very impressed with the dishes that I tried in the restaurant. Every dish is yummy and with the right amount of chilli spice. I especially love the Chap Chye, Nonya Kueh and Tarts. I also tried the Chendol, which was smooth & delicious. Overall it was a great dinner. There was only one service staff on duty, and she was attentive and helpful and a lovely lady. Will definitely go back when I visit Singapore again
