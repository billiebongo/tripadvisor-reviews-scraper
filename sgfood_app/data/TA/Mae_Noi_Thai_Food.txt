Came here for lunch on a weekday afternoon. We came at 4pm so it was not crowded at all, but there was a lot of used cutlery strewn everywhere. We just asked the people at the stall to clear a place for us.Ordered Tom Yam which was good. At only $5 it was quite worth it. Their prawn omelette was tasty, but it was a bit too salty and overly fried such that it became too crispy. Overall it filled my belly pretty well and I really appreciate the value. I'll definitely be coming back here for my quick fix of Thai food

A friend of mine highly recommended this place so we decided to check it out. Its a little hard to find, as its nestled in the folds of bugis street shopping area, this little nook has great thai food and really affordable prices. The staff is super friendly and try and accommodate you and your dietary needs despite it being really packed. try their matcha tea (if they still carry it) and don't leave without trying khao neeo mamuang.(mango sticky rice). They are rather famous for their tom yum soup and their green curry

Located within bugis village is this hidden gem! Made up of 3 shops is a small area of food stalls. Being that this is within bugis village, it is heavily air conditioned as in, I got cold enough to need my jacket.This is the Thai food stall on the left. With drinks like Thai milk tea at just $1.50 and pad Thai at $4. The food is reasonable and the quality is decent.The Thai milk tea wasn't too diluted and sweet enough for me. And the pad Thai had enough wok hei and you could see charred bits of the noodles. There was sufficient crushed nuts for the noodles. You can pick, chicken or pork or prawns. I got the prawn pad Thai and the prawns were crunchy and delicious.All in all, a hidden gem with reasonable prices and great Thai food
