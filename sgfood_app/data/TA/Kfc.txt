Having eaten lots of type of fried chicken, KFC will always be my favorite fried chicken, it being tasty and juicy, cheesy fries is a must try, and whipped potato is something most other burger fast food do not sell.

Tried the new combo mozzarella burger deal. This was a good choice i made. Its fast and the burger is so yummy. The chicken was cooked so well that its crispy from outside and juice soft from inside. I just cant get enough of KFC. Love it as always

This branch is in Plaza Singapura which is the only food place that open at 9.00 p.m. tonight on Sunday of Chinese New Year. The quality of Zinger Burger and a piece of fried chicken weren't that good.The taste quite a bit below standard. Chicken nugget was good though.

Chicken Caesar burger .... Inedible! chicken meat thin flat and looked reformed was almost frozen ( not cooked through in the middle). Bread bun hard and dry as though microwaved . Interface between coating and brown pink meat was slimy. The coating is floury and soggy. The chicken fillet burger the same. Fries musty and tasteless starch. Shocking waste of food. Not respresentauve of any global KFC we have ever visited. I have photo
