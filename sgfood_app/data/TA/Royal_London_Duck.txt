The duck is super soft and not too fatty, it melts in your mouth. Recommend the black pepper bbq duck bun, it's like "tim ho wan" pork bun.

Here for lunch with my niece. Duck was a disappointment, not fragrant and meat tasteless, do not have the Char or smoke taste. Rice so hard and don't taste fresh like overnite rice. Not recommended.

Service is poor at best. The pictures in the menu are misleading. eg siu mei photos show 4 items and only 3 are included. The duck congee includes about 20% of the duck compared to the picture. With the above said, the food that was delivered was good

Visited this place with my family during our holiday in Singapore.The duck they served was soft and yamee. Apart from the duck dishes they do serve Pork & Chicken dishes and also a variety of soups. The staff was nice and helpful too. Highly recommended for families

This review is getting a good rating for the food.This eatery is London Duck by Fei Siong and not Royal London Duck. The address at Centrepoint is correct. We ordered a platter of 3 meats, wanton noodle soup and a bowl of rice. Price and taste was decent but service was unacceptable. Immediately upon our order, we were served a bowl of rice and the meat platter didnâ€™t come until 10 mins later

I loved this place located at Orchard Road. The place specialises Chinese style food, apart grom duck dishes you get pork , chicken and vegetables as well. To keep to the theme, I ordered duck rice and fried duck drumstick and Coke lite. The rice was of natural flavour. It was served with 4 pieces of fried duck with skin and khim chi( chinese pickle). Duck drumstick haf 8 pieces of duck fry with skin. Food was very authentic and very tasty. Price was also reasonable. I paid S$ 16 for the whole order. Highly recommended

This was recommended to us as my friend was wanting to have a duck dish. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal and it was great quality and very reasonable. Great place to go for a family or anyone on a tight budget. Food was of high standard

More of an eatery than a restaurant. Ordered half of a roast duck and black chicken soup. The duck was quite fatty and tough but the skin was nice and delicious. Eat it with the plum sauce for better flavour However, not much meat for half a duck.. for the price I could have the whole duck at a hawker centre, lol. Still a good try to see what is the London Duck all about.. not very Londony, realised it is a HK joint in London.The soup was nice and hot; large portion for one person but not enough for two

Had lunch on a Sunday. Was very disappointed because they were open but had very limited items. It is a Chinese restaurant, more like 'Hong Kong Duck Royal'. It is a bit of self service as you have to help yourselves with the chilli sauce and make payment for your order first. The chopsticks and small plates are in the drawers under the table We had duck with thin pancakes (not Peking Duck though). I must add that the 'waiter' had no skill set to cut the duck skin into thin slices. Also, I felt that the duck was oily. The prawn dumpling noodles soup was acceptable and the serving was little. We also had the fried spring roll wrapped in chee cheong fun and the beef brisket noodle (dry). We were upset that there was no pork belly as the supplier has not arrived with the stock. There were only 2 trays of prawn dumpling left. We ordered 1 tray with 3 pieces for $5.80. What was cheap we thought was a the cost of a drink - $1.50 on Orchard Road! Well, if you feel like having Chinese, you can try here
