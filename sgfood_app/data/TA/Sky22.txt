I learn about Sky22 from a friend. So I decided to give it a try. As we entered, the staff showed us to our table. The view from where we sat was good. The buffet spread was reasonable enough. I like how they served the food in small pots so as to prevent wastage. The Lo Hei was really nice. It was a lovely evening dinner and I will definitely come back again

We live in Bukit Timah and had heard about this new Marriott Restaurant. Convenient to reach - spectacular view on 22nd floor. Service was attentive and warm hearted. Food was tasty. We chose a la carte but they also had a buffet offering with seafood. We will come back.

This is a new hotel in Novena and the restaurant is located on the 22nd storey.We were here for our Chinese New Year buffet lunch just last week and first, we must commend that the place looks very trendy, bright, cosy with a nice ambience and the ceiling is here. What is most impressive is the bird eye's "top of the world" view around the area! Awesome.We were instantly ushered to our table by a staff, sofa seat by the window which is so cool. Sofa is comfortable and everything looks so new and stylish. The cafe is not big as compared to other hotels or even within the Marriott family and so the food stations are actually quite new to the sitting tables. Perhaps they should layout the place better or you may likely to "bump" into someone walking towards you as it is quite "cramp",The buffet spread is actually quite limited, again comparing to other hotels, within Marriott chains or on par star rating ones. And the display of food and the storage containers used to put the food are also "miniature".On the day of our visit, the restaurant served roast duck and pork belly (one of the more popular and tasty food), mee goreng (malay fried noodles), glutinous rice with chinese sausage and mushroom, stir-fried kailan and green bean, prawns, roast chicken and a few more others. The soup of the day was the salted vegetable with duck soup and another western soup which we didn't try.The laksa (malay curry rice vermicelli) was passable, not too strong or contains too much coconut milk like some others but having said that, not as fragrance or tasty too. Would say the food were satisfactory but not fantastic.Maybe the most well deserved mentioned item was the Prosperity Lo Lei (a Chinese tossing of various strip cut vegetables with prawns, as they replace the fresh salmon). Many other hotels or restaurants would incur additional cost if you order this dish during the Chinese New Year period, but it provides this dish free. (but you have to DIY yourself or pay an additional $8 to have the chef prepare for you with more delicate display and praws). But its quite worthwhile and tasty!Of course they also have the bread, dessert (a few types of cakes and a Chinese dessert soup) and a fresh cut fruits/ice cream, pretty standard. Service wise. Actually and honestly slow, very slow. It took them quite a while to fill our cups with drinking water (well in fact, that was done by a Caucasian manager on duty). Our used plates were not cleared promptly or regularly (most of the time being piled up like a small mountain) though as we saw only 2-3 servers with one of them needing to mend the phone and walk-ins. It was only after quite some time, we saw more servers coming in to assist to clear the plates. Maybe the servers were new or rather disorganized.In fact, several times, we had to refill the water ourselves (i.e. bring our glasses to the water bottle stations). Though most servers were friendly and polite, the efficiency of service needed improvement.Value for money? We paid about $38 per person (as there are credit card discounts) and we felt that it was still generally "acceptable" considering they offer the Lo Hei for free though we would expect the buffet spread to be more extensive.Verdict? We would give a rating of between 3-3.5 star, but since not able to give a 0.5 star and feeling that it is not ready for 4, we will keep it at 3-star. We hope the management will look into the issues being highlighted, the service of staff needed to improve and also the spread of buffet! And if these issues are addressed, we will revisit it and not only visiting the sister's hotel at Tang Plaza, one of the regular cafes we frequent

We were there for our annual reunion dinner with our friends and family.The restaurant is obviously under-stuff. Our tables were piled up with dirty plates and bowls at time that we have to help cleared some.The spread is totally pathetic. Limited choice with limited serving. Can't help but to think that it may be better to bring our $ elsewhere.Will definitely not come again

The buffet and on-menu options were delicious - Prawns and mussels were available along with meat and meatless dishes every night! Breakfast buffet was diverse and included something for everyone. They even had some form of great pizza for every meal! The service was wonderful - after several days the staff could anticipate orders and types of drinks. The views from the restaurant are breathtaking of the Singapore landscape. The train access to the subway is literally steps away in the mall behind the hotel and restaurant so it's easy to visit the mall then head up for a wonderful meal before grabbing a train home

First visit to this hotel for dinner at Level 22. Food is average don’t expect typical hotel buffet spread. Service crew was raw and new. Plates were stacking high on guest table, looking around each other pretended doesn’t exist. Unresponsive service, I have to poured drinks myself and drawer for a fork!! Worst no compliments car parking for dine in guest! Such a disappointment for our Sunday family dinner!

On 22st floor of Courtyard by Marriott.

Buffet is not very big, Not much choice. NO french fries!

We were stunned by the view surrounding the restaurant as we didnt really expect it. Excellent place to chill out and have a nice healthy fushion dinner with friends. Will definitely be coming again!

1st time going there. The view from the restaurant is very nice. The service and food is good. Is a good place for couples and friends to go.

It is a very quiet yet cosy restaurant. I love the corner seat w full glass window which enable me to admire the evening view despite the overcast weather. The purple potato main dish is a must to order for vegan!

Food was great, especially the laksa. Service staff were attentive and personalised as they remembered the special request that I made prior to dining there. which made me feel

It was a last minute dinner plan to have buffet dinner and we were pleasantly surprised that seats were available on New Year's Eve at Sky22. The restaurant was not that crowded when we arrived. We had requested for seats by the window but unfortunately, all seats were taken up. As the restaurant is located on the 22nd level of the hotel with floor to ceiling glass windows, one can see the view of the city. The buffet spread was neatly presented along the side of the restaurant. The serving dishes were small but food was replenished regularly. The prawns on ice were very fresh. Cooked food like baby squid char kway teow, black pepper crab, and lamb shank was available. For dessert, there was chocolate fudge, creamer brûlée, and assorted nonya kueh. The kueh was very good, especially the tapioca kueh. To end our dinner, we asked for coffee and tea to be served. However, we were told that that was not included in the price of the buffet. It would be good that beverages be included in the buffet as most restaurant do so.The service is good and our plates were cleared regularly. Finger bowls are also available upon request to wash your hands after peeling the seafood

We ordered Ala carte instead of the buffet. Every item comes in extra large portion. The popiah is huge and that's where the novelty ends. Taste wise, it can't even compete with those from hawker centers. We also ordered the prosciutto pizza. Stay away from it. Not sure what kind of cheese was used but it was bad. Way too much cheese and a taste that was sub par. Such a waste to occupy such a great space and to do it great injustice. Will not come again for sure.

Buffets in singapore tend to feature the same few dishes with a lot of carb-heavy, oily dishes, and a focus on quantity, and not quality. I like it that Sky22 took the effort to differentiate their range of dishes and it is definitely not your run of the mill buffet. I like the baked eggplant and the barley risotto. The vine tomatoes were very sweet too. It is a nice touch that they do not overlook small details like these. The chestnut soup, seafood thin-crust pizza and pan-seared seabass is not bad too.Very good selection at the salad bar (with baby spinach and kale) and also the fruits (I like the tangerines). Could have provided more soft cheese though.Ice cream quality could be improved, they seemed to have used a supermarket brand.Service staff were very helpful and offered to help slice the bread from the bread bar
