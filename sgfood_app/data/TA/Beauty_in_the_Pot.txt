It’s one of the first few eatery which came out with collagen soup. Like the authentic taste. However the rest of ingredients are just average, given the price is at the higher side.
5
Came here at 630pm, and was only seated at 820pm, that was how popular this place is. You're able to make reservations too, based on availability. Food was very good, and so was the service, though the price tag wasn't cheap.

nice hotpot place to celebrate family birthdays events! good location and nice food will visit again!
3
We ordered 4 soups in a pot. only the collagen soup was good. For 6 of us, we paid around $330. It is a more pricey than what we usually pay at HDL. I think it is good to go if you don't want to go HDL

Hotpot tastes good but, let's face it, it's not real cuisine. It is a bit to Chinese cuisine what barbecue and raclette are to Aussie and French cuisine repectively: basic DIY. So paying 75 SGD for 2 persons for something which is quite average, even if products are correct, is definitely not worth it. On top of that air conditioning is set at freezing temperature, the smoke extractors (or whatever vents these are) make a terrible noise and the ipad menus are the worst use of technology that can be: inconvenient to flip pages, unavoidable bugs and uncertainty that order is correct and through, one per table instead of one per person, and screen covered in greas

Had one of those midnight hunger pangs and was craving hotpot. Googled to find out that this place opens till late! Arrived just in time for their last order yet their service staff were friendly and polite, very professional of them! Food was great soup was to die for, by far one of my favourite hotpot spots! As usual I have the tendency to over order especially when Iâ€™m starving and it is the last order, as expected I had loads of left overs which they offered to pack for me (including the soup!) Although they were busy clearing up and closing the outlet they were extremely attentive and always served with a smile on their face! Kudos to you guys! Will definitely be coming back!

Friend brought us to celebrate her birthday ; we love the taste as is very tasty collagen stock. Our first time. The pork jowl is Super yummy, the kuroboto pork so so. Fishball with cheese normal.Their speciality fish tofu was just so so. Ok with the other food ordered. Overall, we love the food..but is quite pricey meal overall.Friend thinks soup standard had gone down compared to when they first opened.We were told we had a limited time and we had to leave by 1pm as we walked in at 11am without an appointment.
3
This is my third visit to this restaurant and it just doesn't seem to taste as good as before. Definitely need to step up on the overall cleanliness. The iPad used for food ordering and bowls are covered with food stains. Feeling quite disappointed as a matter of fact
4
The soup based was filled with collagen apparently. It was very tasty. Well things rarely go wrong for steamboat but I would rate them higher for the tasty soup n ambience. You can even take home the soup base if you want to. The best thing. Byo friendly!
4
Pretty hard to get a table and there was a queue at centrepoint branch up till 930pm on a weekday. What's good was the collagen packed soup base, homemade paste/balls and the large DIY sauce counter. It would have been perfect if they had a just as awesome spicy mala soup base! And service was good too despite the fullhouse crowd
5
Tried 4 soups and all were great. Thumbs up. The service is top notch. Staffs very polite and explained everything to us. Such a memorable experience.
5
The collagen pot is good. The outlet got very limited tables for groups above 4 so advance reservation is strong recommended. The price is stepped at around $30-35 per person. The fried beancurd skin is nice. Service is good.
3
Been there so many time, this time is the worse service. Last time they are busy can understand, this time don't even have crowd but forget this and that and service very bad. Disappointed.
5
The service was top notch: very efficient, prompt and helpful. Food wise, it was very fresh. Portioning is a little small and prices were a little expensive, but otherwise a lovely time. Will be back again!

Especially loved their shark cartilage collagen and drunken chicken soup bases. It's fun to celebrate your birthday here as you get balloons and the crew will sing you birthday song in English and Cantonese. I had to make a reservation 2 weeks in advance to get a slot on weekends at centrepoint.Comparing to Hai di lao, there are no fruits or appetizer from the condiments bar but you get the refreshing sorbet as desserts at the end of your meal. There is no manicure service. But the kids playpen is much bigger and better here (centrepoint branch) than hdl. The playpen were near our table so I can watch over my nieces while eating. They do offer zip lock bags for Hp. The price is a little pricey as well. A lot of pros and cons but if you are looking at excellent soup bases you should come here.

Having never had hotpot before, I was keen to try so why not start at one of the best in Singapore. Only just got a table when we showed up - recommend a reservation. The staff could clearly see we had no idea what we were doing so set us up and were very attentive. We ate, we laughed and we made one hell of a mess. Couple of tips for newbies to the world of hotpot;* Collagen broth is shark fin. * Scoop the floaty bits (herbs etc) out of the spicy broth as it will continue to get hotter.
5
The sharks cartilage broth is a must! The rest of other soup base I wouldn't recommend because those you can get it at other hot pot restaurant. The sharks cartilage soup is their signature broth. The rest of the additional food are all nice to eat too. Their services are excellent.They have another outlet at Centrepoint mall in Orchard Road. I have taste both outlet more than twice and I am confident to say that the broth at One KM mall is much tastier than the one in Centrepoint.But Centrepoint outlet offers additional herbal chicken broth, coconut soup broth which both are unavailable in One KM mall, but who cares? Trust me, you won't touch the rest if you have their sharks cartilage broth.Another different is One KM mall offers free flow of rice but Centrepoint offers free flow of cut fruits.Give them a call directly for table reservation and forget about going through Chope, they take forever to response
4
This is one of my favorite hotpot and i have been coming back to this branch many times. Their service has not failed me and provided attentive service, sometimes i would rather they leave us along as diners enjoy their conversations with our friends.Freshness of food is fantastic, the collagen soup is the signature and not to be missed.

A relative hosted us to lunch here today. We were there at 1145hrs on a Saturday and surprisingly there was no queue. But I'd imagine there wud be one at peak hours as the entrance was lined with a long row of chairs for waiting people in queue to enter the restaurant. We chose the collagen hot pot which was a large pot of thick chicken pork broth served with some red dates, soft touch, straw mushrooms and goji berries. It was yummy on its 'bare' own without us even starting to add ingredients to be cooked. My 7yr old wolfed down two bowls of rice just with the soup alone! The self serve condiments bar to make your own dipping sauce had a wide array of sauces, chopped Chinese parsley, red chilies, garlic, and ready signature sauces for your own mixing. I really like the Thai lemony chilli mix! Rice is free flow at the same self serve bar. Service staff was friendly and efficient. They helped cook our drunken prawns and topped up broth quickly and even peels an entire plate of drunken prawns for us to eat with convenience. After a hearty meal we were served some citrus fruit sherbet which was really nice cool and tangy in small whisky shot glasses. Expect to pay $35-50 per pax. Worth every penny for good quality ingredients and extremely good broth!
2
The overall bill came up to S$197 for 5 adults. We only ordered 2 portion of pork slices and 3 types of fish, pork, mushroom balls. The rest are mainly vegetables. The soup is pretty average for us, we prefer the more flavorful taste of other steamboat restaurants. The sauce table lack variety for people who like spicy spices. The high cost comes from the mandatory add-on like access to the sauce table and free flow rice. Free flow drinks are not cheap too. It is more expensive than coca and haidilao. Service is good but not excellent. Low chance of re-visiting it.
5
Brought many of my overseas friends to this establishment and everyone loved it!
Highly recommended!!
4
Although we gotta wait even with reservation made, it is understandable since they need time to clear the table for the next guest. At least I know they won't chase the customers away after time is up.
5
Great Service and dining experience @ Beauty in the Pot. The food are fresh and the soup-base are delicious too!
5
Has become the go to place for my family and friends to have a nice steamboat meal. Service was good and the staff were very accommodating.
4
Best collagen soup base hot pot. Ingredients are fresh and service is excellent. Price is a bit high and they even chArge for codiments. Need to make reservation else u will need to queue for hours.
4
Advisable to book a table if you are here during weekends. Food are fresh. Staff are friendly to explain their menu. Downside are only can select one flavour of soup base shared, and price is on high side.
5
Went to the went at centerpoint at 3am plus and there were still a lot of guest at that timing.Chose the Collagen broth and the Chicken broth. The chicken broth was average but the collagen broth was good even on its own.Service staff were very attentive, polite and helpful. At the end of the meal, they opened napkins for us to wipe our hands with and prepare a citrus ice blend to help with digestion. Though an ala carte steamboat and pricey, it is worth it
5
Visited the Centrepoint branch on a Saturday afternoon around 4pm, while walking up the escalator, saw the ad on for Beauty in a pot and decided to satisfy our craving. As we didn't make any reservation, we just kept our fingers crossed, and boy we were lucky! We got a table but we were to finish by 5.30 pm. Upon seating, we wasted no time (we only have 1.5 hrs, haha). We ordered the infamous collagen broth and paired it with mala broth ($26++) . As we were not superb hungry, we only ordered, sliced pork, meat ball, vermicelli, bamboo shoots, golden mushroom and fried beancurd skin.Food was served within 15 minutes, service was prompt and staff are polite. When the ingredients was served, they would let you know how long they should be cooked. However the staff were so fast in rattling that I could only caught him saying "3 secs for the fried bean curd skin". This is not an issue, as it all depends how well you want you food to be done. We tried the collagen broth first without cooking any ingredients and it was AMAZING!!. My dining partner kept drinking it, till i have to tell her to stop! (LOL) In summary, the ingredients were fresh and portion was just right (it could be we are not very hungry). I would say the mala broth was mild tasting at first but it gets fiery as time goes by. "_"We spent a total of about $90.00 for 2 pax, which I think was quite reasonable. What i'm puzzled about was the charges for sauces. We were charged $3.50++ per pax for sauces, seriously, how much sauce can a person take? They could take after Imperial Treasure Steamboat restaurant, on serving condiments, to allow the customer to take whatever they want, once and if they want more, then they will have to pay.Overall experience is good and I'll sure visit them again should I have a steamboat craving again
4
We have been to Beauty in the Pot for a few times, we always love the food there. This time around, the service is not quite there. They have forgotten out request a few times. It is hard to get the service staff attention. Most importantly the table is smelly. It is due to smelly table cloth that they used to clear up after each table are done. It is really bad smell
4
This week brought the family to this restaurant and treat ourselves to one of the best hot pot in Singapore. The food was very good and the service staff were commendable, they were keep pouring the collagens in the hot pot. The price was quite stiff but to end it there was a flask of sherbets icy and nice as dessert . The restaurant is very crowded and there is a waiting time of 1 hour in the queue. Highly recommended
5
excellent hot pot soup base.
service was impeccable.
wide selection of condiments.
meats were fresh.
5
Really good collagen soup! Goes well with anything on the menu, but I generally prefer the beef and mushrooms. Service from staff is excellent, but waiting time can be long, even after having placed a booking.
5
Truly beauty in a pot. The soup was excellent. Loved the service and food. Big two thumbs up! Will stringy recommend
5
The collagen soup is really superb! The mala is also very flavourful, alot better than other mala hotpot restaurants. Good & very fresh variety of raw food for hotpot. But abit rush with only 1.5 hours to eat.
3
The food varieties and freshness are not so good as those compared with imperial treasures steamboat.
5
Went to the restaurant for birthday celebration. Service provided was good as usual and the soup was fanstatic. However a flaw will be not enough service staff when it gets busy. Need to wait for the service.

Came to this group to try a second time and the so call beauty steamboat has left me thirsty whole night as a result of their MSG and other taste enhancer in their soup.
1
Me and my Wife visited their outlet in One KM today at around 7pm today, took a queue number and we got number 117. We saw the number being served currently for 2 persons table is 107. The staff in the counter advise us that it will take 45 minutes to 1 hour, so we went for shopping first and return around 8pm plus. We saw the queue number was 110, just when we about to decide to eat at other less crowded place as we did not want to wait any longer then there were a nice couple who offer us their queue number as they have decided to not to eat there. Their queue number was 111 and we were thrilled that it was the next number to be served, so we decided to wait again. However we waited for another 1 hour and it was 9pm plus and the queue number did not even move from 110 to our New number 111. During the wait, we noticed that the other table category for 3-4 persons and 5-7 and 8-above there were no queue. We saw those group with 3-4 persons is immediately served the moment they arrive and there was no need to wait. So I checked with the staff who look like the manager that why the queue number for 2 persons table are not even moving at all after 1 hour wait. To my nightmare, she explained that the 2 persons table are the same size that fit with 3-4 persons table and they will serve the group 3-4 persons first, so as Long as there are group with 3-4 persons keep coming then the 2 persons group will have to wait Long Long. No wonder all the people waiting outside are all couples mostly. Anyway after my complain about their queue system finally they gave us our turn and honestly the food was just ok only. We finish eating at 10pm and we started to see most of the couple waiting outside started to be served at that hour. I understand that from business perspective is good for the company as bigger group will fetch more revenue to them but this is unfair to the 2 persons group and what is the point of having queue number then. Luckily we are not New couple who is looking for a romantic dinner....

Managed to reserve a table for 4 adults and 2 kids during their peak hour. It was the first time that I visit there. However, the service wasn't as great as I would have expected it to be but the quality of the food did make up to it. Would go back again during a less crowded timing.
4
Reservation has to be made 3 weeks in advance and subject to confirmation 1 week before reservation. Seats were not ready when we reached. P.s: entire party must be present before they'll seat you. Presented the wrong bill to us upon payment. Good thing we checked the bill.. some say overpriced. I would say you'll be paying for the service and fresh/quality ingredients
5
Good service nice for. It is a little expensive though😁😁
Service personnel were friendly and attentive.
3
good and the ambience etc is good. nice and will visit again.food is fresh and the waiting time is alright
5
Little Pricy but worth it as the Collagen soup was fantastic. Ingredients were very fresh.
Service staff were attentive and friendly. Recommended!
4
Quality was good. Take note we went on a Friday night and were only allowed to eat for 150 minutes. Book way in advance. Broth was good! I like this better than haidilao
5
Soup base was fantastic and ingredients were very fresh. Service staff were attentive and friendly. Recommended!
3
The booking was made at 7.30pm but it takes abt an hr for us to have a table for our family reunion dinner!
4
love their soup base and food. but the service standard drop since the last visit. need to make reservation
5
We ate at his restaurant, but located in Orchard Road. We had to wait few minutes even if we had a booking, but once in we enjoyed the food a lot. We had steam boat, so manage to enjoy different dishes which were all tasteful, with free sauces and also free fruit. To try when in Orchard Road
5
the soup base for both the yuan yang pot is good. Special tips for those who don't take spicy soup. Mix 3 ladlers of normal soup with 1 ladler of mala soup. its good and adds flavor to taste. The desert is good, an ending of sourness to make your stomach digest faster
4
Good steamboat with quite a wide variety of items to select from. Only thing was that they were short of staff and it was difficult to get their attention but it was a Saturday night so I can understand. We waited for quite some time for our orders as well - somehow they were lost even though the items were the first items we ordered when we sat down. But the food was fresh, the collagen soup was tasty - no complains about the food
3
I managed to reserve a table via Chope.com Ingredients are fresh. My preference is pork collar not the black pork due to the tenderness and freshness. The paste is not frozen type. They provide free flow of rice. Good service. Quite pricey though.
5
Another wonderful meal experience at the restaurant except that service was not so prompt. Have my meal and celebration there 2 times in 4 days. Love the soup base.
4
I must say the ingredients and the broth makes it one of the best steamboat place in town. Prices are on quite the high side, but if you can afford it, you wouldn't be disappointed
4
Accessible by public transport (about 10-min walk from MRT). Carparking-wise, quite difficult to get a parking space. Ingredients are fresh, and serving portions are slightly bigger than some of its competitors', although pricing is also rather steep for some items (eg $1 for one meatball). As a gauge, bill (with no beef and drinks orders) is $150 for an adult, 2 old folks and 2 young kids. Like it that rice is free flow. The bone soup tastes just right, while the spicy soup is rather salty. Service is prompt and staff friendly. Will be back as we love steamboat
4
Visited this steamboat with my secondary school friends! It was my first time trying. In terms of soap, think Hai Di Lao is much flavourful and has more varieties. In terms of ingredients, think more or less the same. The ingredients are fresh and quite big portion :) The service is great too!
5
First time here at Beauty in a Pot and I am already in love. It's hot pot but with good quality ingredients, no nonsense rich collagen broth that's absolutely amazing to the taste and soul. Service is impeccable and very attentive to our need to TOP up the broth, tea and provide that little assistance to making sure we cooked our food right. Love this place and will recommend to locals and visitors to singapore.
5
Went to the restaurant without a reservation thinking weekday will be fine with no queue. However was very wrong. When we reached, we were told that the next available seating was 2.5 hours later which will be around 11pm. Normally, we will not wait but this time, because we have overseas friends visiting us and we wanted them to try this so we waited.Luckily for us, people finish faster than expected and we were able to obtain a seating a few minutes to 10pm. But it was worth the wait as the food and soup was excellent as well as the attentive staff that constantly come over to assist us in topping up the drink, cooking the food for us, explaining the cooking time required and etc.My overseas friends enjoyed the food and experience and definitely will be their choice when they visit Singapore again
5
Only 1 restaurant I believe in Singapore. Nice decor and extremely friendly and courteous staffs (to the extent they bow at you after every initiated conversation). Food was delicious and unique. Chosen both collagen soup based and 'Ma-la' type as well. Both equally very good. However price certainly didn't come cheap, costing $150 on food alone without drinks for 2 adults and 2 kids.Recommended to those yet have tried this concept under Paradise Group
5
I'm a steamboat loving Chinese and beauty in a pot is one that i will go back for over and over again!The soup is so good! both the white/spicy one. Spicy one is not exactly ma la tang and it doesn't numb your tongue should you be worried about that point. White base soup is boiled with shark collagen, chicken feet & red dates for hours! Famous Collagen soup and feel no-sins when consuming it.Free Flow of refill of soup Prawns are alive when served and "drowned" in alcohol for freshness level. Staff were very nice and offered to peel the prawn for us. Do ask them to leave the prawn head attached as that is where all the prawn essence are in (cook it in soup to add extra flavour to soup) Complimentary Yuzu Ice dessert (reflow) for consumptions when done with meal! VERY NICETips:1. Always call in to make reservations as you have to wait very long should you walk in or don't even get a table.2. High end pricing, therefore more people (best if 6-8pax) cheaper pricing & can order more variety to share3. Go after 10pm to get 20% off total bill (Value for money!
4
It is similar concept to Hai Di Lao minus the free snacks and manicure. The soup base variety is lesser than Hai Di Lao though, although the selling point is their collagen infused soup. The meat are not too bad but a wider variety of seafood would be perfect
5
Went there for a meal around late afternoon at about 3.30pm. The prices of the food are reasonable but the soup was fabulous. It was one of the best soup ever tasted and will be going back often.
4
An alternative if you are sick of Hai Di Lao, the collegen base soup is quite freshing and price is slightly cheaper that Hai Di Lao
5
I didnt try others "collagen soup" before hence this is my first time trying and it was omg for first sip in. How can a soup taste so good without msg. Even the home made paste was soooooooooooooo good! Simply cant describe the feeling. Its slight expensive but i would rather pay more to have a good soup and food! Their service so so good too that they keep bowing
4
Love the freshness of the ingredients here. But is always a hassle for u to go here last min. It has to be a pre planned place and not a impromptu kind of place. Great place to bring elderly parents to as the soup and the freshness is to their liking
3
In short summary, food was awesome, very fresh and broth was very good, we went for the mixed broth (spicy and non spicy), it's not too spicy that you can't drink it and yet not too thick and not too collagen-ly. Service was good, non-intrusive and yet attentive and polite.Now the bad points, our appointment was at 730pm, but we were only seated at 8pm. I had a party of 7 including babies/restless children wandering around aimlessly while waiting for the seats. The aircon was unbelievably cold; we feedback to the staff that the cold was way too cold, everyone was shivering from the cold air blasting directly at our seats. I would challenge the owners to sit at our same table and have their meals and tell me the aircon is okay. According to the staff, the aircon is controlled by the building management and they cannot adjust it, I believe that the owners can change the air-ducts in the store, instead of a direct air duct blowing down directly to the diners, consider redirecting the aircon ducts to blow sideaways instead of directly down at the diners. I would return to Beauty In A Pot, purely based on the quality of the food and broth. However during my reservations, I would request for a table where the aircon does not beat down on the diners

Came here w friends at abt midnight after watching EPL.Advanced booking is required else they will tell you there is no seats available (even though afterwards you realized there are still empty tables available)Opened till 3AMFriendly waiter and waitresses helped us settle down and explain the ordering process.Friends wanted to try the collagen soup base. Ordered via ipad. Food is pretty much the same way prepared as other hotpot or steamboat places. Portion of the food were ok. Good varieties of drinks.THERE IS A CHARGE FOR THE CONDIMENTS AT 2.50 PER PAX EX GST. CONDIMENTS are free flow and can be found in the drawer beneath the table.its was a good experience and its especially popular with younger people as i noticed.To me i didn't find the collagen soup was that great nor was there any WOW factor with the dishes
4
Ordered the non-spicy collagen soup which was quite tasty. However for some, as it is pretty thick and sticky, it may prove to be a tad heavy on the tastebuds after the 2nd round of refill. Pork belly and fried bean curd skin are thin and crispy - definitely worth a try. Fishball and drunken prawns are also fresh. White rice is free flow at the sauce and condiment section. Felt that the sauce/condiments and soup at JPot are better in terms of variety and taste. I tried the chilli oil here which was pretty tasteless.Staff service is good and the overall bill for family of 4 came up to $178 - not cheap but worth trying if you are a hotpot or paradise group fan
5
I went to the Beauty in the Pot in One KM. Since the restaurant is always reserved till 1 am (when it closes) we never got to eat there. When we they had an open reservation, we jumped at the chance. We soon found out why it was always full. We ordered the shark collagen soup with shrimp, beef, chicken, mushrooms, squid, spinach, lotus root and potatoes. A waitress came and filled the built in bowl at the center of the table with the shark collagen soup. The service was fast. There were dates in the soup, free of charge. I soon discovered a "make your own sauce" station. There were suggested authentic recipes you could follow, or you could make your own recipe. When the soup started boiling, a waitress put in some of the ingredients. There were special utensils given. The soup was flavorful and rich. We then added ingredients as we pleased. When refills were needed, a waitress came with a jug of soup and poured it in. Overall, this was a great restaurant. I would definitely dine here again.

Beauty in The Pot is one of the concept from Paradise Group. It’s one of the crazy crowded steamboat aka hotpot restaurant in Singapore. Their signature is the Beauty Collagen Broth ($20 per pot / $25 for twin flavors). The collagen soup base isn’t boiled from chicken but from Shark Cartilage which give you rich flavors on your tongue and also abundant benefits for your health. *p.s. also the beauty for the ladies :DCollagen Soup was too delicious till you can’t get enough of it but don’t worry, they give you four bottles of refills and it’s free! So it’s okay if you don’t order drinks because the sup itself can make you so full already.The Ingredients are fresh and superb tasty. You can order either one or half portion (half portion can suit for 2 pax). Order half portion on each ingredients and you can get to taste a lot. We ordered some kinds of mushrooms, Sliced Pork Belly ($12), Ebiko Prawn Paste, Fried Fish Skin ($5), Tofu, Lotus Root, Spinach.There’re a lot of ingredients for you to choose. They provide an iPad for each table so you can look at the menu slowly while swiping them one by one on the iPad :DThe Mixture of the soup and ingredients is so delicious. You can put all the ingredients inside the soup or you can just agar agar put inside the soup for few seconds and eat it. Before that, you can dip the ingredients inside the sauce that you can choose and mix by yourself.The Service of this restaurant is excellent. The waiter / waitress will treat you like a queen / king all the time! They are very attentive and polite, and they bow ALL THE TIME! Like if they remove your plate, they bow, help you with the soup, bow, take your orders, bow. This maybe the greatest restaurant service so far.At the end of the meal, they will serve Yuzu drinks for free. Sweet, sour, and icy. So cool and fresh! A perfect drink after a hot steamboat.Will I come back again? YES for sure. The collagen soup is so addicting and probably will make you want more and more.Tips:If you want to come, be sure to call and make a reservation first. We came at 10 pm to have late dinner but it’s full house and the receptionist told us that we have to wait till 1 am which means 3 more hours. So we decided to go back and have dinner somewhere else then go back to the restaurant for lunch the day after. *we called and made reservation at 11am when the restaurant just opened :

Beauty in the Pot is under the Paradise group. First time here, I would say overall, the food is good. Soup base was special. We ordered half Beauty Collagen Broth and Spicy Nourishing Pork Bone Soup. You can choose the spicy level too. The food is fresh, we like the live prawn. Really fresh! The staff are very polite. They will bow at you when they serve you food. When we ask for ice water, the staff will bow. The restaurant supply aprons too if you need. I like the after meal dessert, refreshing. The restaurant is open until 3am on fridays and weekends, good for supper hunters. Be sure to make reservation before hand. This is a good place for families and friend gathering
