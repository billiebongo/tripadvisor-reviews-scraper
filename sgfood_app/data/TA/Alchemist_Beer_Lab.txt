Came in here for drinks rather than food. Service was good although the beers were fairly expensive and I struggled to differentiate between their straight-forward beers and those which were their own special mix.

Very nice spot, fantastic beers, warm atmosphere. The service realy good and the staff very friendly. We had a very nice time there. Prices expencive.

Sorry we took some trouble to find this place on a hot humid evening. Very attentive staff but the noise levels were awful. Then the music started. We left. There were quite a few couples together staring at the walls. Conversation impossible.

The food and drinks were great. I heartily recommend this place. Very creative beer infusions and a great atmosphere!

BEER: a great selections of beers, ales & flavoured beers with a good choiceFOOD: nice selection of small plates available - the fish was absolutely deliciousPRICES: quite pricey but its a quirky different sort of experience and worth a tryLOCATION: not the easiest places to find if you come out the wrong entrance of the station but the setting is nice and Worth a visit if you are after a different sort of food/drink expereinc

We had the pleasure of visiting the Alcemist at the end of 2017, and found their selection of Beers to be absolutely great, the snack dishes to complement really good, and their service really friendly, attentive and welcoming!They have a wide selection of Beers, also several flavour infused ones which brings the drinking sensation close to ciders. Different, but good!The Orange smoked duck, chicken wings and potato wedges were super good.Recommendable!

Having an interesting infused beer with my daughter, since we are off schedule our first day in Singapore. Unique choices of beers and ordered a very smoky whiskey to sip. Food looks great, but the kitchen had closed by the time we arrived at almost midnight. Will go back for food next time
5
This was a great place. I had the ceviche and my husband had the fish and chips The food was great. The beer was also great and they had wine and cider as well. It wasn't clear from the website that they had anything besides beer so I was super happy when we found out that they had other drinks as well. We sat "outside". It was still inside but it was outside the restaurant. It was pleasant and the staff was good
5
We came for a beer and sampled a few. we then ate and the food was fantastic. I came with two French colleagues who are gastronomes and they were raving about the foord. I had the wagu beef with Fois Gras and Truffle, they had the duck confit. all were fantastic. Thoroughly recommende

Your door sign said you open from Sunday 4pm to 1am. (See attached image) We walked from bras Basah to you a good 15 mins. Hoping to have ice cold beer. Accordingly Your establishment was TripAdvisor recommended. And couple more custoner were also outside wondering. Please take care of those tiny details

Had my birthday dinner here. A very good place to relax with a very sweet and chilling atmosphere. Good food and good infusions of drinks!
5
Amazing food, good infusion beer and a lovely place to catch up with friends! Would highly recommend the wagyu short ribs and pork belly kimchi.
5
Amazing food and although I didn't try the drinks ~ seems to be the real deal! Friends were fans of the fruit infusions and would definitely be getting something to drink in the near future
5
Happened to pop by whilst moseying around South Beach area. Surprisingly modern European Food, crafted Beer was tastefully done. Kudus to the staff for providing great service as well.Highly recommend to friends
5
Held my birthday party at Alchemist- the staff were very accommodating and helpful and the food and ambience is amazing! They really worked hard to give my guests and I a special and memorable night
5
This place is awesome. Just after entering the place there was a guy called Brennan (OPS Manager as he told me while chatting a little bit) who guided us to a cool and cozy place to have dinner. As soon as we looked at the menue he was there to give us some advice on all the different sorts of beer they were selling (btw. This place only offers homebrewed beer). We we're even invited to taste some of their infusions (beer mixed with fruits and spices), special thanks to Trerick at this point! To sum up: we highly recommend this place for a quick dinner and a tasty beer!

SIMPLY AMAZING!! If the combination of amazing food, exquisite beers, personalised service, friendly staffs, WOW-decorated place, superb location and enjoyable ambience does not bag 5* rating, I do not know what else does! Alchemist Beer Place is just simply an amazing place to be! All of those mentioned above, accompanied by good friends, good chat, good laughters, it simply creates an remarkable experience! Thumbs up to Brennan, who offered nothing but an A-class service to our group, we really couldn't ask for more! Thank you!!In return for this amazing experience, I would definitely keep recommending this fabulous place and keep coming back! Keep it up! See you around!!

This is one of the only places with outdoor seating on that whole strip, and itâ€™s sheltered so no need to worry about the rain. They had a live band playing too. We went there with a couple friends for dinner, service was fine and their food was really good. Although the Wagyu beef was way too salty, the rest of the appetizers and mains were delicious. They have a great choice of beers and an eclectic mix of flavored ciders on tap. A good hangout spot for a Saturday night

Its a nice place for gathering of friends & family with accessible location, I really love the pork belly, lamb and the fries. The in-house beers is of a different level for the taste buds as it carries different flavor and personally I love the dark ones. The manager and staffs are very friendly bunch. Cheers to them !!
5
Food was to die for. Highly recommend Crispy pork belly, Duck Confit with Portobello mushroom pie!! Roast beef and fish and chips. For heavenly dessert: Burnt Butter Stout cake with ice cream. A great array of fruit infused beers! I like the Turkish delight beer. Brennan (ops mgr) gave us excellent service.
2
We just like to check out the place but turn out to be so so experience. Introduction of their favourite beers are over-confident and end up the beer was not COLD enough.
4
Had a girls night out on Friday. Good food, especially the Pork belly. Never thought such dish would be so well prepared in a western setting. Very crispy skin and unique sauce. The lychee infused beer feels slightly stronger than the normal beer with a pleasant after taste of Lychee. I loved the creme brûlée, rich and creamy. We were served by Brennan who gave a good recommendation on beers and dishes. Last but not least, the duck confit is also very well cooked. Price is reasonable for the location and they can help to split the bill.
4
A dinner night-out with 5 of my friends turned out to be a delightful one. Our chit-chat was made merry with good food and fruity beers. We enjoyed the beef, lamb and pork belly dishes. We loved the fruity beers Turkish Delight and O My Darling. Thanks to Brennan who attended to us, making wonderful recommendations.

Been wanting to try this pub/restaurant for a while after walking past it a few times. Decided to give it a go mainly to sample some of the microbrewery beers, but was pleasantly surprised by how good the burger was (more of a pulled pork version with portobello mushroom). Definitely recommended. The ambience of the restaurant is certainly attractive with the various beer infusion towers visible. I prefer more of the hoppy IPA beers, so didn't really go for the fruity influenced beers. Did have their Pale Ale (SPA), which was good. The Obama brew was certainly unique and was a plethora of strong, robust flavors - definitely worth a glass. Was expecting more flavor impact from the Marla Maple, as it was advertised as having a smoky oak and whisky infusion, but didn't get those influences to materialize much. Our small group was well taken care of by Brennan, who provided good recommendations. Would definitely go back. Thanks

We were told about this place so came here for a light meal after a long flight. Not overly hungry but just wanted something light before bed. We had a selection off the "light meals" section and was quite tasty. The beer however we thought was really quite expensive for the size glass, probably OK during happy hour. We thought it was happy hour, but were informed to read the small print. No happy hour on Friday nights or weekends but appeared to be every night
5
I came to alchemist after a 6-month dry spell of craft beers. This, of course, is why I ordered the "free flow" happy hour: S$48 for two hours of tastings. 7 varieties are brewed in-house which you can try alone, or, 3-day infused with flavors like maple, lychee, kefir lime leaf, etc. (which rotate). They have a large variety from dark stouts to refreshing ciders.On top of that, the staff was wonderful. Happy to make recommendations, and even providing a complimentary snack. My only recommendation is to extend the happy hour from 2 hours to 3 hours. The "tastings" are actually glasses. So in order to get your money's worth, you need to drink 5 in 2-hours. Kind of makes you feel rushed.Thanks for everything! I look forward to getting my "craft" fix again while I'm in Singapore

Went on a Monday night, not crowded. They have interesting innovative infused beer - think guava, lychee, roses, citra etc. Best part is they give you small shot glasses to try before you decide on what you want. Around $15 per glass. The staff was attentive and service was good. Food on the menu - duck confit, duck fat fries, fish and chips, lamb rump, wagyu rump, chicken wings, brisket burgers etc. Must try the brisket burgers - really good! A good place to chill out with friends after work. Exit F of Explanade mrt. It's just right there. There is both outdoor and indoor dining.

If the beers were $15 each. Luckily I was able to try several beers in little shot glasses, before ordering a whole glass (Ale Yeah SPA). I didn't care for any of the infused beer concoctions, though they sounded delicious. I also ordered pork belly, which was good, and enough food for a light meal for one person, but at $15, I expected maybe a couple other sides to round it out. In summary, the food is ok, the beer less so, and it's all overpriced
5
We held a client networking event at the Alchemist. Staff were extremely attentive and ensured food and drinks were readily available. The variety of beers on offer was a key attraction and selection of canapes were delicious. THis would be a great place to go to sit back and enjoy an afternoon trying some interesting beer flavour combinations. Excellent live music in an alfresco environment
4
Called in late one evening after a meal elsewhere. The staff were very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable and let us try before we chose our beers. Beers were innovative and very tasty with a good variety. Prices are relatively high in the late evening - I wish we had been there during happy hour and had the opportunity to try more
5
Excellent fish and chips and dessert and very good beer. Service was great and very friendly. Highly recommended
5
Held a client drinks function here. The Tomahawk steaks and duck fat chips were great; service good; nice beer. Will be back.
5
Honestly, the steak was so good, I'm suprised Japan don't invade Singapore again to get their hands on it..
Amazing!
5
Just found this bar after a long day visiting sites in Singapore. Other bars were finishing serving food but the manager accommodated us and served great tapas and excellent beer.
You need to try it😄
5
My fiancée, and I just stopped here, because it looked very different! We ordered the 4 sampler beers. Great opportunity to try 4 of them. All were very different, but great. The most that I liked were the rose beer, and the guava. The other two were more strong for my taste. I definitely recommend you stop, and try this place.
5
My fiancé and I met a friend of ours here after she got off work(she lives in Singapore and we were just visiting on vacation). A very nice woman and Brennan took care of us for the night and we're incredibly helpful with us for both beer choices and food options. We were never rushed and the beer here was incredible. The food was also very good. My fiancé and I ended up coming back to this bar later in the night as we enjoyed the beer so much. Cheers to all

ext to JW South Beach. A nice visit. Stopped in at mid week to see the place. Nice set up. Various beers, tries the Singapore Pale Ale which is good choice and samples few other on which was based on sea weed. Skeptical it was delicious choice. Serves food and great for groups or hangout on patio seating

The place was located within walking distance from the MRT station. The outlet was opened by the people behind Little Island Brewing Co. There was both outdoor alfresco dining and indoor aircon dining area. Selected indoor as it was quite a humid night. The outlet was well known for its beer infusion towers, so we decided to have a drink each since we just had our dinner. From the row of beer infusion towers, we could try the beers first before ordering. Since we were both female, we were recommended sweet and light beers which agreed with us.Citra Sea Mead (S$15++)Light with a slight salty taste.All Rose Leads To Rome (S$15++)Mead + Strawberry + Rose hip + Mint Leaf5.5% alcoholFruity sweet in tasteNot sure if the drinks were too sweet as we kept getting tiny flies around even when we were sitting in the indoor aircon area. The place was quiet and not crowded
5
We went for a family meal and drinks at the Alchemist Beer Lab. This is such a cool wee spot. Be sure to sample the infused beers to find one that suits your palette. I really enjoyed the toasted marshmallow infused Beer! Very unique and delicious. The food was also excellent. Quality ingredients, beautifully presented dishes and reasonably priced. Friendly and very helpful staff. This was a memorable evening
5
Just flew in from Beijing and found this place close by my hotel in South Beach. Stopped in and Brennan took great care to find out what I liked in a beer then provided the perfect recommendation! It was the "Old Black Magic" stout which I'd suggest to anyone who enjoys a good nitro stout. They have a great selection of beers and beer infusions but also stock wine and liquor. Price was comparable to what you'd expect in Singapore but the lunch selections were well above average. Definitely a spot to check out if your in the area.
5
A great find! Staff so attentive and knowledge about the extensive drinks menu. I had the honey beer. Delicious!
5
Great choice of craft beers. Very trendy. Excellent host, Brennan. Highly recommended it. Only went for the beers so didn't have the lunch but the menu looks awesome. Will definitely be back.
5
They had an interesting mix of craft beers on tap with some different infusion concepts. Enjoyed a tasting set at their recommendation. Food was delicious - wings and the lamb rump were standouts. Will defiantly return!
4
Nice ambience, great to sit outside. Love the selection of infused beers here, spend a nice Friday night with friends.
5
Really enjoyed this place for its unique approach. Enough to go twice during our visit. Beer (Little Island Brewing Company, LIBC) and food (composed by the in-house chef) choices were of the highest quality and ideally paired. Worth the trip when in South Beach, central downtown
5
While staying at the JW(which is a great hotel) I stumbled across Alchemist. The beer selection drew me in. A wide range of microbrews!!! Upon walking in, I realized this is not just a place for a beer. I saw they had "fish and chips" with sea bass. I had to try it. The batter was perfectly crisp and the fish was fresh and tasty. The fried potato slices were also great but the salad was amazing. Yes, for the first time in my life I had salad with fish and chips. Fresh greens with a very light dressing. This place is awesome and is a top reason why I will stay by the JW again. Friendly, clean, fresh and microbrews. Nicely done

we visited the Alchemist on a Wednesday night. Brennan looked after us for the evening and providided us with with amazing, personal service. We were also given great assistance by an English barman while we sampled the beers on offer. Both Brennan and the barman were incredibly helpful with recommendations based on what we said we liked. We settled on a glass each of one of the infusion beers "All Rose Lead to Rome" which was a tasty fermented mead delicately infused with with rose, which was very light and and refreshing. We shared three plates of tapas, being the salmon croquettes, duck fat fries and lamb rack, everything was cooked to perfection and the flavours were nicely balanced. The three plates were just the right amount for two people to share for an evening meal. The atmosphere here was great, as well as the lighting and look of the venue. Prices were very reasonable for the quality of the drinks, food and service we received. Would definitely return, and thank you to the team at tThe Alchemist for a lovely evening

... and the food's not bad either! Small tapas style food, freshly made and served hot. Pairs well with the beers. Not being a beer drinker, I tried a honey mead and loved it. Very fragrant and refreshing. Not overly sweet but enjoyable. Was Chinese New Year so not many people about but great relaxing place to visit.Brewer was on hand to assist with our selections and all the serving staff were also very knowledgeable. Highly recommend

First time visiting the Alchemist Beer Lab, really surprised when I was greeted by the server who invited me to taste their in-house infused beers for free. I was used to this foc "beer tasting" in other countries...so I appreciate it. how else wld you choose a beer from so many options eh?The beers...they had some interesting flavours and names. eventually went for nervous breakdown because it had the highest alc %! haha I wld recommend the infusion with stout and marshmallow too...Afterwards ordered the pork jowl for dinner. great recommendation by the manager, this was the special of the evening so hope you get to try it again if you go because it wasnt on the menu!The overall place was not crowded, which is not a bad thing and probably thats why I saw many couples there on dates (I'm guessing). There is alfresco area with live DJ entertainment and also indoor seating with open kitchen and bar.Very very good experience, hope to go back again for the ambience and their award-winning beers! And I know I can trust their service. :

The folks at Alchemist Beer Lab do pay special attention to ensure that you're having a good time and that you always have food and drink in front of you. There is a wide selection of beers with interesting names, which helps you recall..especially after you've had a few and you're still going strong! Brennan is the absolute host and will recommend the best foods to go with your beers
5
First time to try local brew beers and infused ciders,with the help of ivo who accommodated me and friends very well. Food was really good and the music was very funky. Will recommend to friends and family.
5
Never seen so many beers in my life...
Really enjoyed trying most of the selection...
Service was good, too..
5
The alchemist beer lab offers a wide variety of artisanal beers and is right on trend. It's great that they offer you a taste before you decide which beer to take. But the most surprising thing was the food. It was really excellent, both in presentation as well as taste
5
We did a corporate event yesterday at the Alchemist Beer Lab. Brennan did a fantastic job with his team in looking after our guests right from the planning down to the end of the event. Food was amazing, place is cozy and nice, couldn't ask for a better place to host our summit party
4
We happened upon this on our first night in Singapore. My husband had "run" out to the pharmacy and was gone for nearly 90 minutes (he got lost) so when he finally got back we were starving and this was literally next door to our hotel.The food and beer were both very good although a bit on the pricey side (not uncommon in Singapore)
5
We had a corporate party at the venue for 90 pax and everything ran smoothly without a hitch. The food was very good, substantial and delicious - our guests were well fed. The beer and ciders were awesome and every one of our guests loved it! Even ladies who did not usually drink beer found one that suited their palette. We had an awesome party, everyone was having such a great time. Thank you Brennan for your assistance and lovely hospitality to make the party a success
5
We had a farewell party held at Alchemist Beer Lab. Ambience is great and everyone enjoyed themselves with the tapas and drinks! Their staff were very friendly and helpful. Despite the last min booking at Alchemist Beer Lab, they are able to accommodate with our request and provide an excellent services, a BIG THANK YOU to Brennan and his team for the evening. We had a great fun there! =

If you like beer, they offer free tastes of their various offerings. I tasted Sister Golden Ale (quite good) and That Old Black Magic stout (quite good). The food was also good for a group looking to share small plates. The server was quite helpful and friendly
5
Brought my boyfriend here for his birthday, he loved it! We dined al fresco, and the decor was very classy and romantic. The beer selection was wonderful (highly recommend the All Rose Leads to Rome) and trying all the different types was super interesting. The service was perfect - the staff were friendly and genuinely happy to give us samples and explain more about the beers and dishes. Our main server Patrick was very thoughtful and checked on us a few times, which I appreciate. The food was delicious, especially the ceviche, wagyu beef tortilla and truffle croquettes. The experience was very worth it, and I would definitely go again
5
We had a private party at Achemist Beer Lab recently. Everything was just perfect! The tapas served at the party was delicious and the drinks great! Staff were efficient , friendly and helpful. Special thanks to the manager , Brennan, for accommodating our requests and coordinating everything smoothly . Everything turned out as we had planned and desired. The DJ Malcolm X was also excellent- playing great music throughout the night, both at dinner and during the dancing. Fabulous place for a party
