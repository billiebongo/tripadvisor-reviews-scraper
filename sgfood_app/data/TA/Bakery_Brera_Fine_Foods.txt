Let's be honest. There aren't a lot of great options at the empress market. Brera bakery is a real standout. Savory pastries are consistently good. Most of the sweet ones are too. I think the cinnamon roll recipe needs a little extra work. But everything else is fantastic. Some favorites: scones, baguettes (they have a good variety - experiment), the cruffins. Occasionally they do fruit cake and some other holiday baked goods. These are stellar. I didn't know fruit cake could be so good. Seriously. Amazing. Buy and enjoy it. I asked the owner to text me when it's available. I don't even live nearby anymore. But I'll make the trip. Prices are eminently reasonable. Just go.

This European style bakery housed in an HDB block offers very good artisanal breads like ciabatta as well as burrata (flown in a few times a week). The fact that it is located next to a wet market makes it convenient to pick up fresh bread/pastries or other gourmet Western groceries after shopping at the wet market

It's always nice to discover that one has a local bakery. Bakery Brera opened in earlier this year but I only just discovered it. I haven't tried much yet. But the baguettes and cinnamon rolls are both good. And I'm looking forward to trying their sourdough pizza. The selection is a bit limited. Apparently one needs to order pizza an hour in advance. Overall. They have a decent selection of baked goods, including (importantly to my mind) whole wheat products - like baguettes and such. They offer a lot of sweet pastries, like cake slices, red velvet muffins, and of course cinnamon rolls, etc. They also offer savory baked goods like sausage rolls. There is a bit of seating outside, haze permitting I guess.
