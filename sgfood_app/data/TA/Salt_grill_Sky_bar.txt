Salt grill & Sky bar have excellent ambience with very good foods, friendly staffs and services. Definitely a perfect place for couples.
5
been there twice now and the standard hasn't dropped btw the 2 visits. Quality of the food is excellent, service is top notch and the view is breathtaking.
4
Was there with family on a Sunday afternoon. Great view and atmosphere for high tea on a weekend. Pricing a tad expensive though.
5
Place is very modern and relax. Peaceful mind when you have a afternoon tea with a view of singapore city.
4
it was my 2nd time been there. but the food for me still feel so so. we went there for the company dinner.
4
The food is delicious and leaving us wanting more. Hamachi is deliciously fatty, steak tartare is well seasoned and look beautiful with the plate used. The flat iron steak is well cooked, juicy and tasty. Desserts definitely is boring. The view is also boring with those lifelessly building.When we order a wine by the glass, we wished they could have bring over the bottle and then pouring the wine into the glass? We like to see what we’re getting.Overall we enjoy our meal

We chose this restaurant for our reunion dinner. Not a usual choice, but we thought it would be nice to stay away from the usual lunar new year ritual and noise of louhei tossing and endless Chinese dishes.It was a perfect evening! I'm so glad we made a departure from our ritual.So we entered the elevator from the level 4 concierge at ION Orchard and the ride up to Level 55 was like going up a "magical tree" akin to climbing the jack and the bean stalk. This illusion was created with an audio visual screen inside the lift that moved together with the lift.When we reached the top we were seated by the window to take in the city landscape while watching the sun slowly descend.This experience was worthwhile already!Now the food!We were blown away with the appetizer! I would be happy with just having that for dinner alone! It was the organic free range egg crab omelette with Enoki mushroom and herbs salad. It was served with a miso mustard broth which was poured upon serving.The mushroom Had a crunch like it was freshly picked! And the light herbal tinge from the salad added the right zing to this amazing dish.We thought it totally overshadowed our mains! I shamelessly slurped up every drop of the broth.OK, for the mains we ordered the New Zealand King salmon with scallop ravioli, served with lemon puree...AND corn fed chicken breast, served with foie gras and truffle farce, young corn, smoked bacon jus and dehydrated sweet peas.Both dishes were just the right size but we realised this only after finishing it. The portion did look a bit small initially but it was indeed filling especially after our pannacota dessert. we felt satiated and happy watching the sun set, slowly sipping our drinks. Ahhhhhhh.. We could do this every evening!Highly recommended for the experience, the food, the view and ambiance.

Firstly, you need to have a reservation.. its best if you want a nice table beside the window. The experience starts at the elevator, which is a nice touch. Ours was for 6.30 pm. Just nice to settle in and watch the sunset while you have your meal.. and perfectly dusk as you drink your beverage. You have to go to the 4th level where you will be escorted to the private elevator. While you are being elevated..you can watch yourself "ascend" from ground level , past the trees and up to the sky.We had starters and Mains with a bottle of NV Langson . They showed us the meat cuts, which is very usefull. Wagyu and Oz meats. Very tasty. It doesnt matter what you order, Im sure you will enjoy your meal.If your'e on a budget, dont come here. Having said that do come here for that very special occasion.Service is excellent !!! Very attentive and professional.Something to note. If your'e a smoker like me, you need to go back down to the first floor and out on the road to have your puff. NO smoking area at all.It was a good night for me
5
Taking the lift up to level 55 was a memorable experience with the animation screens. Then the big windows capture an expansive view of Singapore. We had the set lunch which is super nice. The cut of the day is very good, just the right amount of chewiness and Super nice sauce. The crab omelette is very tasty and different from the usual omelettes. I also like my sorbet (but the strawberries weren’t sweet enough). We also order the mash potato with truffle oil which I felt was too overpowering but the mash texture is great. Total cost is $160 for 2 person.
5
Service in this restaurant was excellent and while the food is slightly pricey, they were made to perfection and the serving portion is large! On the 54th floor, the restaurant offers an undisturbed view of the Singapore skyline. Best to go around 6.30pm to catch the beautiful sunset :
5
First-time trying their lunch menu, will be back for their dinner menu again! Service always good :)
5
Didnt know the space of the restaurant is narrow. Would have been better if the restaurant is circular and revolving , then the view would hve been better. Overall food is great ! Will definitely come again.
5
A beautifully appointed bar and restaurant with exceptionall views of Singapore. Key sites are marked on the windows so you know exactly what you're looking at.
They also have a Happy Hour drinks menu
3
Food standard has dropped slightly but still above average. The view is fantastic, especially in the evenings.
4
Great view, great ambience, great food. Wonderful introductory to the cuts by the staff. Will definitely return
5
Brought my husband here to celebrate his birthday, had the set lunch. The food was really awesome!! And the staff was so sweet to print out the photo they helped us take for the birthday celebration, really appreciate the awesome service too!
4
Ambience was great，staffs tried their best to accommodate to our requests and often checked on us to see if we are comfortable :)
5
fine dining at its finest! ordered a 'surf n turf', which is steak with king prawns. very delicious! the sauce which goes together with the steak is very unique but tastes good! but, price is not cheap though. the setting which is at level 55 of ion orchard, indeed has a breath taking view
4
The sunset time is beautiful to watch from the 57th floor glass windows, if you can ignore the construction cranes that are littered all across Singapore.It’s a very high end eating joint, great for special dates or celebrations, but make no mistake - you won’t enjoy it unless you are a steak lover. The menu has lots and lots of options on meat, but the other items are limited and okay-ish. This is not a criticism as the place makes no false advert about what it’s about.They have nice oysters as well, but what lovers most(apart from the steaks) was the earl gray old fashioned. Regarding the steaks, there very little to say apart from the fact that they are expensive and TOP of the class. If you can spare the dollars once in a while and want a bite of some of the best meats, this is the place to be.Revisit likelihood - Always
5
Very dedicated service rendered by the staff. They were rather attentive, coming forth to check if the food served was to our liking as well as making the occasional recommendation (eg. checking if we would like any mustard for our steak). Service definitely comes first, followed by the quality of food, and lastly the atmosphere of the entire venue. So, keep up the good work 
5
Beautiful dinning restaurant and excellent service and the view was super awesome! Food was good and the serving for two was just right.
5
We had a good lunch celebration at Salt Grill. The staff were v thoughtful to even frame a family picture for our rememberance. The steak was exceptionally delicious!
5
Dinner at the Salt grill and Sky bar was a wonderful dinner experience. The service was great and dinner was exquisite. There are amazing night views from the restaurant. You can see the laser show beaming from the Marina Bay Sands. Highly recommended to visit!
5
View was perfect, food was good. Would definitely reccomend for anniversaries or couple dinners. Price is ok too.
4
We go there as we would like to have a great steak.
The services is great, food is good but expansive, cost performance is good anyway.
1
The service was terrible but the food was alright. Had the oysters and I can safely say that was one of the worse decisions ever. Woke up the next day throwing up. Had some serious food poisoning. Just terrible. Won't be going back ever.
4
Good ambience. Good service. I like the complimentary birthday surprise cake. The view from the top is fantastic.
5
We had an amazing dinner for two at the Salt Grill on the top of Ion Orchard. We ordered a host of different items - from the oysters, to the sashimi, to the wagyu steak, and an assortment of tempting side dishes like pork belly - the food was outstanding and well presented. And, what an extraordinary wine list!The service was also excellent. We were well treated by Tony Tan and his staff.If you go - don’t forget to reserve a table next to the window for the best views. It’s an excellent atmosphere and paired with the food and wine and of course, great company - the Salt Grill is an extraordinary experience that we highly recommend

My friends and I decided to dine at Salt Grill & Sky Bar because it is rated for the nice view and ambience. While dining we heard a male server cursed "stupid lady" as he walked past our table, subsequently we heard him cursing again. This time in dialect "Wah Lan Eh" This is really unprofessional and uncalled for. It is not very pleasant to hear a server in a fine dining restaurant cursing and talking loudly to his co-workers openly in front of the other guests. My friend order a glass of wine before our meal started, she took a sip but did not like the taste of the wine and hence it was left untouched till the end of our meal. Our server did not bother to ask why she did not drink her wine.As a top fine dining restaurant, the management should look into giving the service staff proper training and be more attentive towards the guests needs
4
We visited ion sky and the view was spectacular . Unfortunately we only had half the view as the other half was taken up by the restaurant. We decided to dine at the restaurant as it was our anniversary. The restaurant didn’t disappoint. The ambience was first class and the service efficient. As we didn’t want to spend too much for the evening, we shared a starter and we each had a main course. The waiter served us bread and warm water. They were not pushy at all unlike some other restaurant. Our bill came up to $245 which is reasonable for the posh location. The food wasn’t that special but the ambient made up for it. Should visit at least once
3
Food was superbly cooked and plated. But service was medicore. Waiters, waitresses and restaurant managers should not be selective on guests and can be friendlier.
5
The best of best.
Delicious cake, tasty tea, gorgeous view, luxury restaurant, friendly staffs.
No more words, just try and feel it yourself.
5
Their lunch set pricing was reasonable and the food quality is great. The raw fish was well-prepared and the organic tenderloin was juicy :)
5
Had the best afternoon time spent with my girlfriends! The hi tea set was delicately made, very balanced palate... the ambience was amazing and the service was excellent!
5
Just stumbled upon this place to celebrate my wife’s birthday and I didn’t regret choosing this place. Food was cooked to perfection and the 55 floor view in the night of Orchard road was fantastic. To top up the night the restaurant gave us a surprise complimentary birthday dessert for us to enjoy. We will definitely go back again to try out the rest of the menu
5
It's such a luxury to have a weekday girlie lunch, so I decided to book Salt Grill for I've enjoyed fond dinning experiences there before. This time Salt again lived up to its reputation: great food, unsurpassed window view, and tentative/efficient service! We ordered the lunch sets and the restaurant was so patient to accommodate my friend's strict dietary requirements. The impeccably concocted cosmo added extra icing on our aldy jolly lunch!
3
I went to see the views, the bar doesn't really have the best view which is a shame (the dinner tables do). The bar women was actually not very friendly, I was the only person there and she gave me a glass of flat sparkling wine. The rest of the staff were very smiley but to be honest I wouldn't recommend, so many amazing places in Singapore just very average no wonder it was empty
4
I reserves for 10 pax and we were accomodated promptly. I just need to make a $50 guarantee reservation fee for our table. At the event day, we were escorted to our place with an amazing view. My boss and colleague were happy because they love the place, the ambiance and the food. For starter, we had raw fish for the day ; Organic free-range egg crab omelet and Bangalow pork belly.Main, we had the Meat cut of the day (tenderlion) ; Corn-fed chicken breast, foie grass and truffle farce and ; Fennel and pepper crusted seared tuna, safron potato rouille.Sides, Truffle parmesan fries and King Brown mushrooms, confit garlic anf thyme.Desser, Sorbet and Lemon TartCoffee or Tea for Drinks.I will surely try and comeback again, maybe at dinner to see the majeatic view of the city at night.
5
The view was great (is a little hot if you were to sit by the window for lunch), but nonetheless, the atmosphere, the view is lovely. The staff serving us was lovely. Great attitude. The food was amazing. I had the Tartare and meat cut of the day. Beef was juicy. Dessert of the day was delicious too. I really had a great time over there.
5
Our dining experience with office colleagues was truly a delight for the senses.From the moment you get on the dedicated elevator from the 4th floor to the 55th floor, you will be surprised by computer graphics on the walls simulating an ascend up a giant beanstalk (until you reach the rainclouds). Wonderful surprise to welcome you to this high-end restaurant.The menu isn’t that wide in variety but there’s plenty to choose from - salads, steaks, seafood, cheeses and various side dishes.I highly recommend starting off with Bangalow pork belly with seared scallop, smoked apples and grains. This serves as a good appetizer to your main dish. Again, I recommend for the main their New Zealand king salmon with scallop ravioli, lemon puree and uni. This goes well with a side dish of mashed potato with truffle butter. The smell of truffle itself will make the potato tastier. Add an order of rocket salad to complement the meal. To end your meal, please try the sorbet of the day. I was able to taste the combination of passionfruit, coconut and raspberry sorbet, surrounded by real fruits of raspberry, strawberry and blueberry.Truly a delight for the senses. Be prepared to pay though, as quality comes with a price
4
Had a great dining experience at salt grill and sky bar, view was amazing and it is suitable to celebrate events like birthday or anniversary :) it will be good if my table is situated at window seat
3
A group of us celebrated our gf”s birthday. I would say the view is indeed impressive with good lighting. The dessert however can be worked on.
5
Highly recommend for couples who are celebrating special occasions. We had ease of communication when making reservation too.
4
Good experience. Open a bottle more worth while. Try to reserve a table near the window so you can look out the night sky. No set menu for Sunday dinner.
5
Service was perfect even from pre arrival, and salt grill staff paid attention to the smallest detail which made the entire experience an amazing one.
4
Had a good quality 2 hours of dining with great food and service, ideal for couples to have great time together!
5
Our second visit here for our week long anniversary celebration. We tried their lunch menu this time. For starters, we had the steak tartare and crab omelette. For mains, wagyu steak with potato mash & truffle butter. Every dish was a delight to our trained palette. The lemon meringue was a tad too sweet and hubby finished both off for me. Sweeping vistas of the city makes great selfie pics. Service staff took a pic for us to commemorate the occasion.Looking forward to our next visit
5
What a wonderful panoramic view this venue gives of Fantastic Singapore.Yes I love this place.Starting with the ride in the super lift with light show to emerging out into the restaurant wonderful.Book early ,weeks before ,ask for a window table.Dress, so as not feel out of place.Remember to be specific when ordering,small error let the waitress pour out tea before we had received the wine.Easily resolved with freshly made tea when requested no charge.Great location in the mal,try their free introductory tour if your new to Singapore as they are so vast you need some initial help to become orientated to their layout.Thank you for great Afternoon te
4
Service was good but can be improved. Pre-ordered the dessert as a surprise for my partner but have to remind the staff to serve it after we finish our main course (which kind of defeat the purpose of a surprise). Nevertheless food and the ambience was satisfying
5
the food (lunch set) served were great. the pork belly for starter and king salmon for main were perfectly done. while my partner truly enjoyed her wagyu tartar and ribeye steak. the green apple sorbet adds a nice finishing touch to the meal. service was impeccable too.
5
Excellent in service and quality of food with a fantastic view. The set lunch menu was value for money.
5
I love Chef tasting menu, it was so lovely food and good service by Ken kuwako and good selection of wine, definitely I’ll be back to dine in again with friends.
3
Food and ambience was pretty good. Timing & duration that food was served was well considered as well.
5
Experienced the new chef's menu and was really happy with the food variation, quality and taste. Service was attentive and caring. The view was gorgeous.
5
Went to the restaurant to celebrate our 9th years anniversary. Was first blown away by the amazing cityscape view from the restaurant. Then the waitress's exceptionally warm service made us feel very welcome. The food was great which both of us has thoroughly enjoyed it. Just when we thought that's all for the night, and settled the bill, they brought out an ice-cream with a candle on the word (happy anniversary) to our table. Needless to say, both of us were surprised by this gesture. I wold recommend making advance appointment (if you can) to secure the window seat
4
Dining at Salt is a transporting experience. It starts with taking the purpose built elevator that brings you to the penthouse floor and is immersive with computer generated imagery of flora. The panoramic view of Orchard road in the restaurant is impressive (and arguably better during the day). Service was friendly and impeccable. I liked the presentation of different cuts of steak available for that day. Food has been much improved since my previous visit. A place worth returning to.
4
First time was to sample the bar, this time it was the full Monty with dinner reservation (booked by a colleague). The menu looked adventurous but ultimately, perhaps we erred in not attempting the Tasting Menu with matching wines. Somehow, the pork and foie gras terrine and Bangalow pork belly got a bit lost in translation. Singapore is crammed with eateries covering a huge spectrum of styles, flavours and cultures. The diversity is as amazing as the range in pricing. I think it ranks with anything at Dempsey Hill, (if that is your preference), but it wins hads down for its location and views. I think we will reserve final judgement when we next dine there.....and we will be more adventurous in our choices
5
We called in without a booking and managed to get a table, first thing is of course the view, 55 floors up over looking Singapore. There where two lunch options, al carte menu or lunch special, we chose the specials menu, cost only $49 per Head, I had the sashimi followed by the seared tuna, my wife had the beef tartare followed by the fish of the day, which was salmon, we also had some charred broccolini all of it amazing, the meal set included desert and coffee. All in all a great meal experience with fantastic service and amazing views. Next time I will do the tasting plate with accompanied wines. Make a booking and go
2
We were nicely greeted and seated at the window with view of Singapore sparkling at night. Very nice so far and set great expectations for a wonderful meal. Then the rather odd service began. Apparently we were to have drinks first per the server’s plan for our evening. We asked for menus - there was an uncomfortable pause and server rolls eyes - menus arrive and server disappears. We sat a long time and this was a theme of our meal - we were just ignored continually through the evening and had to beckon for service. We talked of leaving and felt unwelcome. The appetisers were nice and the cold four grad and crab omelette are recommended. But the ribeye steak for main course was over-spiced and the flank steak tasteless. Asparagus side tasted rather like paint. Panacotta dessert tasted more like dishwater. Although the view astounds, it didn’t make up for these other deficiencies.
4
We found this bar on the way back from a visit to Raffles and Marina Bay ( it is almost across the road from Raffles). The host was friendly, as were most of the staff, and we chose to sit outside. We tried several of the dishes from the snack menu, sharing them between us, and I have to say that everything was very well cooked and very tasty. I did not eat anything better in Singapore. A little bit pricey, but very enjoyable
4
Went there to celebration my boyfriend's birthday. The food was very tasty but the truffle fries was a bit disappointing because it wasn't crispy enough.
5
Great customer service, from the start at the reception all the way until the bill was paid.
Table was in excellent view of the City as well.
5
Wonderful view from our window seat, yummy food, and good service! Highly recommended for a romantic night out!
5
I was visit there on Sept 2017 with my Friend dinner. I have a awesome and great experience there!! It have a awesome environment and feel very relax while I have a dinner there !!
5
Good atmosphere. Nothing really special on the menu, but for the experience and the view, it's worth it.
5
We visited this restaurant for team dinner. I believe two thing separate this restaurant from the rest- it’s view and service ! This restaurant is situated at 55 floor. On a clear day you can view the Singapore end to end ! It will make you appreciate the planned urbanisation of the SG without compromising the environment ! It’s a famous place for proposing ! I liked their steak collection and the overall service. You need to make reservation to dine there and they have dress code 
5
My husband took me here for another birthday gift. Wonderful service from start to finish. Our meal was absolutely delicious. Our waiter was from the Ukraine and boy did he know his job. Of all the ingredients in each dish, the history and the story behind each steak. Where the produce was from. We were also recommended which wine to go with each dish. My husband was absolutely full.... our waiter suggested grappa which helps digest the meal. My husband was impressed and .... it worked. The restaurant manager popped by our table and thanked us for coming and took onboard a suggestion from a westerner point of view. And those skyline views....... breathtaking
5
Service was really good, brought my partner for birthday dinner and I had to do last min request about having a birthday cake but they didn’t had it instead they brought us the desert with happy birthday wording and candle. It was really nice Worth giving it a try and view was great too
3
Dine with my wife. 55/f of ION ORCHARD building. Very good view. Good service. The appetiser is Ireland oyster. Tasteful and full of salt water. Can be more fresh, but still ok. For the mins course, I take the rib eye steak and my wife takes the pork belly. The meats are good, but the taste is really questionable. My steak is cooked with onion and the taste is sweet and a bit sour. My wife's pork belly is also sour. Very good meats but the taste is really strange. I think if just give me salt and pepper, the steak would be excellent. I have asked whether the chef comes from and the answer is Australian.Very good place, very good service, the Italian wine is also nice, but the main course is very disappointing. I think I would cook better at home with this meat at home
5
got to get up there via a 'private lift' from the 4th storey of ION. thankfully the rain cleared and the bright skies appear when we arrived. take a moment to enjoy the view before settling down for the food. the steak is really good. service is prompt and servers are friendly
4
Dined during the F1 race weekend, views and ambiance were great. Some of the menu items from the raw and appetiser section were unavailable which was disappointing. Service was however attentive.
4
Fantastic view of Singapore's skyline. It would be good if the main course for the set lunch menu can have more selection.
5
Price was reasonable and service was attentive. Staff are very well trained and polite. Price was $$$, was expecting that for the view a
5
The atmosphere is really good and pleasant, especially for couples celebrating their birthdays, anniversaries and special occasions. Food is good as well, albeit it's quite pricey.
4
Staff was attentive and friendly.
Food was nice except the fish that was too salty.
Great to celebrate occasions.
4
You probably can't get a better or more spectacular view of Singapore at night. It was truly amazing. The food was very good especially the salmon which was cooked perfectly. The chicken was moist and tasty. Probably should have had the truffle mash over the fries. Staff were attentive and professional
5
We were craving for some desserts and wanted a less crowded restaurant. We were greeted by some friendly staffs and were quite happy that the servers were very attentive as my friend and I were underdressed for the weather. The staff offered another seat which is warmer as it was definitely a cooling day after the rain.
3
Took my mother to the Salt Grill for her birthday dinner,& she was impressed. Noted there were a few tables celebrating either birthdays or anniversaries,& there was a photographer going around taking a complimentary photo. Nice touchSteaks and side dishes were good, & Australian centric desserts were good as wellIn terms of views, frankly I was underwhelmed. Perhaps better during lunchtime , where there's more to seeA major disappointment was the service which went missing for sections of the dinner. This is unacceptable for such a high end restaurant, which is priced accordingly. Perhaps, it was due to fact , we were seated at a corner table away from center. If not for this, I would have rated this "very good
4
I've wanted to come to Salt for a while, so on my wedding anniversary while my dad was in town we went for a nice dinner. The views are spectacular, try to arrive in time to see the sunset. Warning, they keep the restaurant very cold, but the waitress brought me a shaw, which was very kind. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for a vegetarian, it's mostly a steak place. The oysters were good, skip the hendricks gin ones and go for the wasabi raw oysters. My dad got the sirloin and my husband got the flank, both thought it was delicious. I had the salmon which was also good. After dinner they brought a mini dessert with a candle that said happy anniversary and one for my dad that said, "welcome to Singapore" and that was a really nice touch. Portion sizes were much larger than I expected from a higher end restaurant, that was a huge plus! I recommend Salt for a special occasion or as an alternative to MBS for some nice views of the city
5
I made my return visit to this outstanding restaurant which stands on the 55th level of the prestigious ION. The moment we arrived at the concierge we were escorted to the restaurant by a smiling hostess and the moment we arrived we were greeted by all the guest relations.The food as usual was great & delicious from starter to appetiser to main course to dessert. Both my daughter and myself had a great time sharing over old times
4
Enjoyed a great lunch with a fantastic view . Great menu with lots of choices , food plenty , very well done and presented . Definately a great place for business lunch or a nice private dinner - not recommended for kids and families
4
The flavor and the presentation of the food was good. The restaurant was clean and the ambience was very good too!
5
Seldom you get restaurant with great view also serve great meal, this will be the one. Service is excellent. Great for couples, family and small group. Only slight negative is the price.
3
1st time trying. We were facing the South of Singapore so the view isn't fantastic. Is Is it a view of many flats. Food was alright, nothing that wow me. Price was not as expensive as I thought it should be.
4
The steaks at Salt Grill & Sky Bar is fantastic. Good portions and extremely tender.
Oysters were really fresh though could have been bigger.
The crab omelette is indeed a great specialty.
The view was fantastic and the whole atmosphere was amazing. Romantic and stunning.
5
We visited in August for our anniversary and Salt exceeded my expectations in every way. Most importantly, we ordered the T Bone and this was one of the best steak I have had since moving to Asia in 02. Perfectly cooked, flavourful, and the last bite as good as the first. The meat was worth every penny paid.Side dishes were delicious. Wine list was quite good. We ended the meal with a 1947 Armagnac which seemed a nice touch. Single malt lovers will be disappointed with the Scotch selection--my only criticism of Salt.Service levels were excellent, attentive but not too much. I generally have low expectations of steakhouses in Asia. Salt, however, is first rate. A brilliant meal and I can only give my highest recommendation.
4
Located in the heart of Orchard Road within ION, easily accessible via public MRT/bus and private transport with loads of parking space. Reservations will be needed, where a concierge will lead you to a lift upon reaching the service counter at level4. We celebrated Valentines Day the day before actual, food was very good. Service staff even showed the raw meat cuttings available for the day - very interesting, never came across before. Service could be improved but was not disappointing. We would come back for the food and to have spot near the Windows.
5
Went on Sunday brunch and it was perfect place for us since we wanted a quiet place with great view. Staff was attentive and cater to us several times just to check if everything is fine. Food was well worth, and the steak is a must order. They also prepared birthday decoration on our dessert without us asking, but I see that they do notice our birthday balloons. Overall Great Dining Experience
4
Heard about the launch of the new menu so we decided to give it a try, and it was great! I enjoyed the dessert, Tim Tams with milk, the most as it was a good balance of chocolate, hazelnut praline and milk icecream. A great place for a couple dinner
5
Treated my friend to Salt Grill & Sky Bar for lunch today. Reservation was made a day before.Restaurant located on 55th Floor of ION Sky offering excellent view of the city. Had set lunch at $49++. The main course which was Barramudi fish with mussels with clear soup was fresh and tasty, an unique creation.The dessert was Sorbet with berries tasted refreshing, added with english breakfast tea was acceptable
3
Had a 6 course tasting menu. Nothing fantastic about the food and it was a pricey meal. The good thing about it was that it was a fairly quiet during the night we visited, hence, dinner was very peaceful.
5
Service was great from the moment we arrived at the reception, all the way to the end. Food was very good as well - recommend the foie gras, the steak, barramundi, as well as the Sydney Crab Omelette.
2
I had specifically requested for a window table but, did not get it as it is on a first come first Serve basis apparently. The food was just ok.. nothing special and the portions are are small.
5
I think this is the best fine dining restaurant in town. Served by friendly staf. Recomended place ever.
4
I went there today with my husband. The restaurant was pleasant, very nice and also the view.
We order a sirloin with mash potato truffle and a special gnocchi cheese. The taste was really perfect. The staff was great. The price was very expensive .
5
I have booked salt grill & sky bar for my fiancée birthday dinner through Chope, and I have put a request on window seat and put a note that is for my fiancée birthday celebration. They actually take note on this and given us a private dining area which more quiet and have a nice view from our seats. They have taken note that is my fiancée birthday and when we order for dessert they actually nicely decorate the dessert as happy birthday words on it. That's very sweet of it. For the food, we have both order steak. And both our steak are excellent. My fiancée and I was really enjoying the food for that night even the dessert was really good. We would definitely go back for the good food and the ambience of the place as well as the excellent services by the staffs over there.
4
When it comes to restaurant views, I must admit I'm quite partial towards the Marina area. Though around Orchard, Salt Grill & Sky Bar is one of better ones you could have. We were here to celebrate our anniversary and it was our first visit to the restaurant. The interior's tastefully done. The staff were friendly and customer-oriented, carefully explaining each dish as they're served. The food's delicious and they don't scrimp on the portion, so not to worry if you have a bit of an appetite. We were a little disappointed though when our drinks took a while to arrive. We had to follow-up twice before they were finally served. Not a deal-breaker though because overall, it was a great dinner experience. We especially loved the Polaroid photo they took of us, which they placed in a cardboard frame with "Happy Anniversary" printed on it. I suppose it's their SOP for special occasions which I think is very sweet. Happy to go back again one of these days
5
Enjoyed the lunch with my BFF. I have left a message to celebrate my BFF birthday when I booked with Chope,she was pleasantly surprised with the arrangement made by the restaurant. The sweet dessert was presented with a candle with the word 'Happy Birthday' written on a stone plate and a printed photo(complement by the restaurant) Tk U

Amazing views of Singapore w about a 320 degree view of the skyline. The service was outstanding and the food was delicious. We had the three course lunch menu and everything was executed perfectly. They also have a great happy hour from noon to 7:30 every day. Love this place. I'll be back!!!

We visited Salt on my birthday on a Tuesday evening with our 8 year old. We booked online via Chope the day before and got an immediate confirmation. In my booking I requested a table near the window and also told them it was my birthday, and mentioned we had a child and would like an early dinner. On arrival we were taken to a great spot,next to the window close to the walkway up to the second floor, and thoughtfully away from immediate vicinity of other diners. They have a kids menu which is great for a restaurant of this calibre. They took drinks orders and we had crab omelette and salt salad for entrees. They bought out warm bread and some chips to start, which my son enjoyed. They also bought out all the different cuts of meat on offer and explained them to us, so we felt a little guilty when we ordered the market fish. A decision we didn't regret however, as all the food was delicious, served and portioned in front of us, to my husbands delight as he could make sure he got the prime pieces! My son ordered spaghetti, and there was a slight delay with his meal. They were very apologetic, explaining that the sauce had been over cooked, and they wanted to redo it. As if he would have noticed! It came out after 5 minutes, was delicious and without prompting they complimented his meal. We were there for sunset, and although it was a cloudy day the view was spectacular. After mains the waitress came out with a free birthday sorbet complete with candle and took a photo of us which she then printed and presented to us. The whole experience was fantastic. Salt is working harder than its many competitors in this fantastic city to keep customers happy. It was the little extras and thoughtful attentiveness that made it my favourite dining experience of our trip

Food was great especially the steak. Crispy on the outside. Tender on the inside. Service was attentive. Even move us to a window seat. A great effort for decorating the dessert for our wedding anniversary
5
Beautiful view, ten stars for service. Only problem was very limited vegetarian and gluten-free menu. Otherwise perfect
4
Good service with attentive staff. Food was very good
Staff followed up with special request for window seats and birthday surprise; prepare a special message for my loved one for his birthday and even gave commemorative photo as souvenir
5
Reservation for dining was easy to do it at chope and they even called to confirmed on the things I requested.
Service a excellent
4
1st time being there and the experience was awesome. The view was great. Was amazing by the lift movement bar.
5
Good quality food! Not a heavy meal (so don't expect to be very full). The natural lighting is very nice for photography.
5
I brought my Husband there to celebrate his birthday. The staff were so sweet and surprised us both with a scoop of ice cream with happy birthday in chocolate on the plate. I didn't expect this pleasant surprise. Thank you for making our visit experience there a wonderful one!
4
Nice views all round especially if you get a table by the window but do be warned that it gets very warm and you could have the sun shining in your face. Had the 3 course set lunch which was good value for money. The SALT salad and the barramundi were good. Service was quick and efficient. Good place for a business lunch

8 of us went for lunch last Monday, 26 June. Each of us ordered a set lunch and starters to share. For appetizers we Charred Fremantle Octopus and Sydney Crab Omelette (these two dishes are a must to order, it taste yummy). Since it was a working day for us we opted for mocktail instead, Strawberry Sling and it was so good that we had 2 glasses each before the meal and after our meal! Considering the skylight view the price of the set lunch was reasonable for 3 course meals and I have to give credit for the dish potion was pretty generous (its filling

Went to sky grill for a birthday dinner. I must say restaurant takes birthday celebrations seriously. For one, we were allocated window seats which were limited. The restaurant also provided a complementary fruit platter with a scope of sorbet ice-cream, lighted with a candle. It was simple yet beautiful. The amazing atmosphere, the great degustation menu, and the superb service were really worth a second visit despite the price tag.
5
Awesome view and ambience, reasonable price for their set lunches, excellent and personalised service!
4
Knowing the prices in advance made the visit ok.
16$ for a mocktail and 20$ as entrance is expensive, but worth the views.
5
superb views, sun light all across the restaurant.
Lunch was yummy, and not too posh.
You have to take a lift from the top floor of ION Orchard mall.
5
The service crew took care of us very well. Definitely will recommend to family and friends. More than just the food.
3
6 of us had lunch in the restaurant. Booking is convenient. The presentation and taste of food is good. However, we were seated under the sun and the service staff did not seem to notice it! Had to request for the blinds to be lowered so as to block the sun from shining on us directly. Air condition at our area was not cool too. We ended up sweaty while having our lunch. I think that dinner would be a different feel as there will not be direct sun on customers, and the evening scenery from level 55 would look beautiful
5
I celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here. Everything was fantastic - service, food, food presentation, view. I especially appreciated the fact that they took note of my seating preferences and even provided the selected dessert with a birthday deco message! The photo printing at the end of the meal was also a very nice touch. After my meal, the team even emailed me the photo - amazing customer service there. The only thing I can think of that can be improved is the flat iron steak - was a little tough for medium. Other than that the rest of the dishes were absolutely on point.Thank you Salt Grill for the wonderful lunch experience. I will definitely be back :)
5
Set lunch was very reasonably priced and good. They even served snacks and bread before the appetizer. Service was excellent and restaurant ambient was fantastic, not to mention the view from the 55th floor was awesome. Had a really enjoyable lunch experience with my partner there.
3
Great service, great view, great oysters for appetizer BUT:- entry level wine is overpriced - food is average: pork loin was not tender or juicy while squid was hard - either frozen or poorly cookedTo sum up: nice place for a cocktail with view but skip the foo
3
We spent a couple of hours enjoying the view and (a limited range of) happy hour cocktails. The service here is a bit slow and their kitchen is shut after lunch until 6pm, which is a missed opportunity, as a few tapas plates would've been the perfect afternoon accompaniment. You will definitely go back for the view, not the service
3
Tea with a view but that's it. There are better coffee and desserts else where for the fraction of the price. Savories were good though thought the flavors used were very complimentary and some unique. Been there for dinner awhile back, tea paled in comparison, dinner definitely had more exciting dishes! Not a seafood lover but the seafood dishes were well done; one of the more memorable items at least. Would recommend for a special dinner occasion however there are better places for tea
5
We celebrated a birthday here and were not disappointed. The food was excellent and the views of Singapore were stunning. Apart from one waiter with a tired smile that wore off as soon as he turned away, the rest of the wait staff were excellent!
4
Staff is already good, but in such a restaurant staff have to be more train to be more friendly.
Eg: Smile while serving the foods
4
It would be better in the evening for the view of downtown, but we enjoyed a peaceful afternoon in sky bar. The seat beside window is available and the dessert is great. Hope we can have a drink in the next visit.
5
Impeccable Service, you are treated like Kings & Queens
Fantastic View - Day followed by Night
Exquisite Dining Experience - the food was flavorful and glorious
5
Marvelous food experience. The view is great,the environment is good for romantic and quiet dinning. The desserts of the day is surprising good and nice. Impression is very high. Will be returning patron soon.
5
Really nice place for dating :)
Very comfortable for conversations, not so noisy as in many other places, and have a bit privacy :)

It's a first visit for us, so we went with an open mind. And we were pleasantly surprised!Excellent service, friendly staff, efficient all the way from reservations to order. It was a nice setting, floor to ceiling glass windows, with views to die for - except that the weather wasn't great (nothing anyone could do about that)We had the 3 course executive lunch, which includes their signature entree of glass crab omelette with miso broth. It was on my to-try list and I highly recommend it. Though there was not enough crab in my opinion. My baby barramundi main was nicely charred with crispy skin but a tad salty.Overall good experience, highly recommended for business lunch or romantic dates.Book early for a window seat
4
Requested a window table last minute which was a little way back but still good. If you want a closer view, must book in advance. Need to be there about half hour before to take in the view. It had been raining all day so not a clear view.
5
Dinner for 3 for a family celebration.This place never disappoints. The menu is short and modern Australian with a slight Asian/Middle East fusion element. They bring the selections of steak to the table which is a nice touch (perhaps not so much if your are a vegetarian). Perhaps because of the short menu the waiting times are never long. Food is excellent. All meat very good. The fish can be better still - my wife had snapper that is often (even in expensive restaurants) not so good but this was exquisite.Excellent winelist.The place is definitely very expensive but the food, service and the spectacular restaurant and views make it worthwhile for a special occasion
5
It was my wifeâ€™s birthday and we decided to celebrate in Singapore this time round. Comparing the standards in Europe, it was one of the best we can find locally in Singapore. It was heaven on earth! We tried all their recommendations and we were excellent. Not necessary to comment on their dishes or wine as they were amazing. You will leave and say I would pay more for that, definitely worth it! There is limited seating so make sure to put in a reservation
4
Very good place, nice city view, delicious food. Price is a little bit expensive.
But it is really good for lovers or couples
5
In the centre of town near the Fairmont with an aussie Chef . I had the sword fish main with a a prawn entree. Outstanding meal , one that would be memorable . Expensive but Excellent . I returned the next night for the calamari.
4
Food is yummy especially the steak & appetizers! Service is very good. They surprised the hubby with birthday greetings & complimentary photo! Ambience is fantastic. Very romantic😊
4
Really enjoyed the ambience and service during lunch. Good place to spend with friends or for business.
5
Service is good and food delivery quite fast!! There are snacks served while waiting for our steak. Very nice view and atmosphere.
5
We were delighted with the service. I arrived with my partner and were seating at a table with a decent view, however after about 5 minutes the waiters asked if we would like to be moved to a more private romantic spot by the window, and from then on the evening took off. The waiters were wonderful, we had about three people taking care of us the whole night. We were presented a fine range of meats and had a full description of where each type came from. We didn't plan on having a romantic dinner but the restaurant made that a priority. It turned out to be a very pleasant evening.
4
My wife and I came up to Salt at top of ION Orchard for lunch. It was an enjoyable afternoon.Food was of qualify as expected from the celebrity chef Luke Mangan, who had a long history of successful restaurants in Australia and abroad. We had been to his restaurants in Sydney including Glass since the early days. This time, we were looking for something extra or an surprise element in Singapore but we didn't find it; it was steady and the trademark Luke Mangan's cuisine, which no double was nice.The view was unparalleled anywhere in Singapore; we took our time and walked around the skywalk to soak in the atmosphere and enjoyed the view.Overall it was a pleasant experience
5
Celebrating my husband's birthday for a beautiful meal at Salt. Views were stunning and got there just before sunset. The food was outstanding, as well as the price. I'm not sure we've ever spent that much on a meal between the two of us. With that being said, it was five star service and our meals were amazing. Would definitely bring visitors to the sky bar for one drink at sunset.
5
I and my husband came here to celebrate my birthday. As it was on Monday we easily had booked a table.When we reached the place we got seated at a table near window. Thus, we enjoyed a dazzling view of the city. Got some good advice from waiters about meal and got really pleased with food. Service was excellent and prompt.Definitely come again
2
I hate to give this place a bad review because I really wanted to love it. Steak was chewy in the worst ways, food was mediocre in general. Service was incredibly slow and servers were really hard to track down. They ran out of condiments and we had to ask multiple times for things we had already ordered. The worst of it was that the observation deck is open to the public, which makes for a really awkward ambiance with random families/tourists looking into the dining room as you dine. When you're paying these prices you don't expect this type of vibe.Saving grace was the hostess who was very friendly and tried to be accommodating. Would not return here unfortunately
3
Nice enough ambiance. Food was average. Service was average. All-in-all not as good as expected. Definately not value for money.
5
Attentive service staff. I love the entre and desserts more than the main course. The restaurant links to the top level where you can take a 360 degree walk after your meal.
5
I had the lunch set and i really enjoyed the food. The taste and quality is exceptional and i really enjoyed the crab omelette as my appetizer.
5
Awesome night view, impeccable service, excellent food and great ambience.
I had a medium rare steak and it was cooked to perfection. My fiancé ordered a kurobuta pork and it was delicious as well.
What an enjoyable birthday celebration and we will definitely return.

We went to salt grill on Saturday night for the degustation menu with wine pairing. There were 6 of us and we all left feeling really quite disappointed.For the price you expect more of a fine dining experience. The food was nothing special at all and the wine pairings were really not nice either. There was little introduction to the food, no sommelier, and it felt like they were really rushing out the courses when you barely finished the last. We were seated in the middle of the room and asked to be moved to sit next to the window so we could get a good view. There was an empty 2 seater and a 4 seater table but it was only after several attempts that they actually agreed to push the 2 tables together (there were no other bookings)... not the best service when your about to pay a fair amount on the meal
5
My wife and I decided the Salt grill & Sky bar would be the perfect venue to celebrate our 41st Wedding Anniversary and my birthday. We were not disappointed. We chose the Spring Special Lunch Menu and it was one of the best meals we have ever eaten in a restaurant. Our meals were beautifully presented and the taste and quality reflected this.We were seated at a table by the window overlooking Singapore out to the Harbour and the view, despite being overcast, sometimes cloudy and wet, was awesome. When we made our lunch booking several days prior, Ferrah the young lady attending to us, asked if we were on holiday. We said yes and we were in Singapore to celebrate our 41st Wedding Anniversary and my birthday. Unbeknown to us, Ferrah advised the restaurant of this; when dessert arrived one plate was decorated with 'Happy Anniversary', and the other 'Happy Birthday'. This was a lovely surprise and we were so pleased. Our waiter took photos of us and printed for us. Our thanks for a special day to Ferrah, and our waiter and to the other staff. The service we received was excellent.We will definitely be returning to the Salt grill & Sky bar for lunch during our next visit to Singapore in November this year. The restaurant is worthy of a Michelin star
2
The service was absolutely terrible.I was seated outside and while the two servers flirted with each other, I sat for 15 minutes holding a menu. When I flagged the woman down, she was curt with me and seemed offended I interrupted her. I ordered and the male server brought my beer and then 10 minutes later my appetizer. All this while two other tables were seated and served. They forgot the bread which came another 10 minutes later. The owner hopefully reads this. I was there April 2nd at 3pm. Food was good which is why it gets the whopping 2 star
5
We went there for birthday celebration. The lunch set menu is good. We enjoyed every dishes. Got arranged to window table amazing views of the city skyline. I've ordered their signature dessert molten chocolate cake, they perosnlize the dessert and took photos for us and presented in a card to the celebrant. Staffs are friendly and helpful.
5
I had a business dinner at the restaurant. The service was impeccable, with great attention to detail. The wine selection was great but rather expensive. The food was fantastic - It has been a long time since i last experienced creativity in taste, texture and presentation in a fine dining restaurant. Congratulations to the Chef and his team. The service crew provided professional work and advice on wine selection. They took care of every single request and need. I will definitely come back for both work and leisure. Well done
5
Great service and the night view! Reservation was made at 1 week ago so that we could have a window seat to enjoy the night view.The waitress was friendly and observative.She brought us a refreshing experience with an explanation of the different type of meat. Meal and drink were all served promptly and taste is totally impeccable. We had sorbets for dessert which was served on an exquisite plate, and it became the perfect ending to this meal. Thanks for the wonderful experience today
5
Came here for a drink and quick bite which was very pleasing . Great atmosphere along with a menu for all tastes
4
The food was good and view is nice. Only thing is that the food choice for set lunch is not many and I went there for oyster but on that day oyster was not available, too bad...
5
Celebrated my hubby's birthday at Salt Grill. Had lunch menu, $49++ per pax. Great value with great view! Ambience is good too. Service is excellent..
4
Visited on a Saturday afternoon to take in the views. Happy hour pricing in the bar made for an enjoyable afternoon. Amazing views of the city skyline. Well worth a visit.
4
Chef was into detail of food. Even bread with herbs and appetisers were so unique. A great experience with the setting and its panoramic view.
5
Excellent experience of good food, ambience and service heightened by a fantastic view from the 55th floor
4
Panoramic view of Singapore. Nice ambience. However, food pricing may be a little too steep for its taste. Some dishes were too salty. Decent presentation of food though.
5
Every time I stop over in Singapore I try to make time to come grab a bite to eat here. In the middle of what can be a chaotic city centre, Salt grill & Sky bar is a perfect way to rise above it all! The view is breathtaking and the food is very good a reasonably priced. *the trip up the elevator is great!!
4
The ideal place for a great meal and a great view. And you can still have a look at the Santosa and Sky Bay from here, for the addicted ones. It is 360 Â° view over the city with an excellent meal / menu - Australian inspired, but because of the owner - and service. Perfect from a romantic dinner to a more formal business one. That was our scenario : after business meeting dinner. There are always a few recipes that help you to determine the good and the bad. I will not tell you about the Australian Wagyu versus the Japanese one but about the way to cook it. The ramp is a tricky part to cook - too much it is hard as stone ... Pefection is about medium rare ... And they served it that way. Great !Ambience is smooth with a jazzy music
4
Visited whilst on business in Singapore - I would recommend booking (essential on busy nights) and request a window table. The views over downtown Singapore are spectacular. The food is described as Australian fusion - which means meats and fish you know from Oz, but served with an Asian element or flavour - so my Barramundi with tempura prawns and spiced broth were great ! If you can get a table - worth it 
4
Staff is friendly and helpful. 5star ambience with stunning view of the city. T-bone steak is great, just the cocktail that's disappointing
5
Wonderful lunch - excellent service. Birthday girl was made to feel very special. View is amazing.
We enjoyed our lunch
4
We tried the lunch set, reasonable price and well served. The scallop of the starter is fantastic and basically the most tasty one I ever tried.
5
food and ambience is great! great for celebrations. there is a link to the level 56 to have a great view of the city
3
After having a lovely lunch with friends here before Christmas I was excited to try their afternoon tea. One of my friends had been before and and said it was really lovely, with real Aussie flavours like Anzac cookies, laminations etc. it was not even close to my expectations. Very disappointing actually! Bring back the Aussie flavors, the nice layered stand and the yummy Aussie style food, and the nice china cups. We left quite a bit of food
4
Haven't been back to Salt in prob a decade? Like the woodsy feel. The set lunch menu had a very good variety and portions for the price. Had a birthday celebration, and Salt personalised the dessert and took a photo which they presented in a card to the celebrant.Food quality was A*
5
Took 46s in the lift from level 4 of ION art gallery to level 55 of the restaurant, great view was complimentary from the lunch!We had set lunch $49++ (per pax):appetizer (kingfish sashimi & scallop), main course (kurobuta pork & iron steak), 1 side (salad to share), dessert (sorbet & dessert of the day) and coffee/tea. Freshly baked breads were served with olive oil & spices. Then we had complimentary chips of orange/purple sweet potatoes with dip. We totally enjoy the quality food. Portion was good. Service was good. And the view was great! Worth a visit
4
Tried the set lunch here, which for $48++ was great value for 3 courses, welcome platter of warm bread and chips /dip, table sharing of salad or fries. Great view of the city although if your seat is under the sun might be a little warm feeling. Put more UV sunscreen ;
4
This restaurant is very recommendation for a birthday celebration girlfriend, with a view of singapore from height is very beautiful, but too fast for the service of his, here to enjoy the evening my girlfriend's birthday, but it does not matter all very beautiful and the waiter was very friendly with a little joke to make us entertained to solve the beauty of the view, landscape and atmosphere in salt grill and salt tapas 56th floor .. until we forget the ever here. Very recommended. We will back soon
3
I went to this restaurant yesterday evening for the second time. First time, it was a good experience and this is why we have decided to go there for my mother-in-law's birthday. Nothing special or negative to tell about the good, which was good and well presented. The problem stems from the service. The personnel is nice and cheerful but not well organized : we had to ask for the wine list twice, we were aksed several time (by different waiters) if we wanted some sparkling or still water, we were served the entrÃ©es at the same time as the dips/chips for aperitif, we have been waiting almost 30 mn to get the main course ... Another issue : we were placed at a table just in front of the amazing view but had only a little candle to light up the table. We could hardly read the menu and see the dishes ... Others tables were lighted up in a better way (soft ceiling spots over the table) but ours was almost in the dark... So I would say that compared to thousands of other restaurants in Singapore were the food is very good and service is perfect, not sure that the Salt grill and Sky Bar gets your money's worth
4
The staffs were all super friendly and is very willing to engage in conversations and strike small chat. Good work.
5
the experience at the restaurant was fantastic. the food was up to its standard and the service rendered by the staff have been marvellous.
4
Located at 56th floor having unforgettable view to Singapore island from many different angel
You will enjoy your time
4
The service was good.
We went there for afternoon high tea. But the dessert was not good as we expected. Especially the cupcake was not delicate enough. And the taste was not as good as twelve cup cakes.
The view was awesome.
4
Went there for dinner for a birthday celebration. Food is very good but quite heavy. We ordered too much. Oysters were good and their steaks are excellent. Great service but actuallly too fast we wanted to enjoy more our food.
4
I think it's a must-go restaurant in Singapore, you can have a really pleasant meal there with an excellent view. The staff is very friendly and the food is very delicious.
非常值得一去的餐厅，美丽的视野，舒适的环境，优质的服务还有美味的餐点，哪怕只是点一杯酒静静的坐着都是一种享受。
5
I don't really have a sweet tooth. I'm one with more of a savory taste. Yet there are savory dishes that can satisfy me. Had the truffle fries; simple dish yes, but the flavoring is just nice and not overwhelming and we had 2 bowls. Coupled it with their tea, it's great afternoon snacking. Also had their fruity gelato, which is excellent. If your girl friends are look for a place with a view with great desserts, this is it
5
Had a relaxing late Sunday lunch. Arrived there at 1.30 pm and realised that their set lunch is up to 1.45 pm. The 4 of us enjoyed the view, the ambience, the service and the food there. Went there 3 times previously for dinner, and this is the first time we went for lunch. The view is much better in the day
5
Visited Salt Grill for business dinner. Very close to my hotel and the intersecton of Orchad and Scott streets. Its on the 55th floor of the ION shopping center with a beautiful view of Singapore. Excellent bar/cocktails. Service was friendly, helpful and new the menu well. We all had the scallops for starters and the Barramundi as the main. Good size portions and well prepared, great taste. I'll be back
4
was not interested in the bar, the view, and somehow with so many comment about that i was fearing the evening dinner food wise. i was very pleasantly surprised.menu list is not exhaustive, but there are a few good things. my foie gras was very good. i then followed with the Sirloin which was also excellent.wine list interesting and i picked very interesting aged French and Portuguese wines (a shame they ran out of this 2008 Madiran)now, of course, i was not paying myself and that makes a significant difference : the view, the atmosphere certainly caries a premium, it is a bit hefty and would not have paid for it.but i had an excellent dinner
4
Lovely view and the appetizers in particular (crab omellete and scallops) stood out! They also arranged a beautiful dessert for my husband's birthday and even gave us a special photo in a printed frame to take home afterwards!
5
The food was really nice and the ambience was perfect! The service was excellent too. Highly recommended!
3
Food was alright. Service could be better. Great view and atmosphere. Overall experience was average.
5
The dining atmosphere was really nice and romantic. Really love the squid ink chips and the risotto!
5
I like the environment and view, it gives a relax and wonderful feeling accompany with good food. My only feedback is aircon temperature should be lower during afternoon as the bright sun might makes the place a bit warm.
3
This is a nice place, with almost a romantic atmosphere. The service is what you can expect from a restaurant of this category. But I stayed with some feeling that for the money spent, that are better placed in Singapore. It's about details. There is a view, but the orientation doesn't offer the best of Singapore. The lighting is also too dimmed: the dish is nicely presented as you can expect but you need the light from the phone to appreciate it. And the table light (too weak) use this alcohol candle that can have a disturbing smell that destroy the tasting. (And by the way in the toilet also agressive bleach smell... but nice view over Orchard road)Overall it's a nice place; It can make a lot of people happy. For me, if I have to choose a fine restaurant with a great view over Singapore, there other better option
3
3rd time I have lunch at this exclusive restaurant and I am amazed at the food and the stunning view.I love the photo they give you at the end when you celebrate a birthday, that's really cool. I must add the food is great. Some negative points though the waitress does not know how to serve Champagne! She didn't want us to tilt our glasses, we are French... and a bit annoyed by that. There was no more foie gras on the menu and that was disappointing, the bread was not great... The food is delicious, yet ordering spaghetti bolognese for my 13 years old, there was so little in his plate we had to order 2 times... and pay twice...but the Spaghetti were delicious
5
My girl friend has reserved this place to celebrate for my birthday and she have reserved a window seat. The view is nice and superb, staff are friendly and after ordering the courses, they served us bread and chips and explain to us the ingredients as well. The ordering and serving is fast and efficient, all the main and side dishes almost arrived at the same time. The food is good, I have ordered a pork loin and the meat is tender. After our dinner, the waiter has delivered a birthday chocolate fudge cake and he also took a photo and printed out for us. After enjoying the birthday dessert, we proceed to the back to see the night view and there is a electronic telescope as well as sticker pasted on the curtain wall to inform customer on the direction and places. Overall experience is great, waiter is very friendly and helpful to help us take a lot of great pictures, food is delicious except that menu varieties are not that much but nevertheless it is still worth a visit, highly recommended

A friend suggested we dine here. Most of the experience was good. We arrived and welcomed, waited ages for drinks we ordered (this remained the case during the evening). Our mains arrived at very different times forcing 2 of us to watch my wife eat her lamb while we waited for a shared T-bone. A $200 t bone. It finally arrived, expertly cut and served, though rare, not medium-rare. Very hard to tell in dim lighting (which you actually have to have as you want to see the view at night) Cannot really be returned, but it was very good just the same. Dessert was good. Enough said about the food.The restaurant was great and the view brilliant.We looked around, took photos, paid our bill and weren't even thanked as we left. We left anonymously. As though we weren't even there at all nor spent $700 on three people.Got to the bottom of the building and had to navigate our way out as the shopping centre below was closed.I think Mr Mangan needs to get back here ASAP to get front and back of house into shape
4
The view from level 55 was nice. The staff are friendly. The food was nice but a bit too pricey. Worth to try if you have not been there. Side note: the staff helped us to take a photo and made the effort to print out in birthday as compliment. It was a pleasant surprise to us.
5
Always enjoyable. Staff friendly unobtrusive and accommodating with our dietary requests.
Do try the grilled mushroom asparagus side. Oysters with namjim sauce was ultra fresh and refreshing. Will be back
4
Brought my friend there for high tea. We ordered the high tea platter with tea. The serving was just right for us. Would recommend this for a relaxing afternoon.
5
The restaurant service and their quality of food is excellent. The restaurant is suitable for anniversary celebration.
5
Food was good, ambience was awesome with great view! Service was good too. We had the executive lunch set, it was really value for money :)
2
We were there during X-mas for dinner. The view is good but the quality of food is below average. Prices are extremely high considering the quality of the food. We won't go there again.
5
Food was 1st class, good selection of both entrée and main, some unusual combinations which were full of flavour. Very reasonably priced food and wines for Singapore. Location.... top of the Icon building, magnificent view.
4
This is one you cant go wrong with. The menu is good and the food is delicious. Good service and a great view over Singapore. Enjoy your experience. Make a booking.
5
Wanting to celebrate with a toast to my mother's birthday we were impressed to visit the Sky Bar and be treated to the wonderful service and hospitality of the staff. We enjoyed three delicious cocktails off the impressive list on offer and the staff even provided us with a beautiful dish with sorbet and a handwritten birthday message. The location is outstanding and the view is breath taking! This is certainly a location to visit to celebrate any occasion! I can't recommend the venue, and the amazing staff, enough! An awesome way to start 2017

If you are expecting to this is a fine dining place, the service is not up to standard, first, the staff guide to the right lift lobby does wear a polite and friendly manner. The waitresses there seems running in a rush to push us to order full and after they rush to service us, a bunch of them were playing phones and chatting in the bar area which just next to the dining area. Quite disappointing

We first had a drink at the bar, while waiting for our table. Impressive wine list, a choice of Salt's special cocktails - both are recommended!The choice of the food was wide enough and everything we tried was delicious. The way Luke Mangan combines various ingredients and how well they taste in a dish is amazing!That's an experience you have to try
5
It was a girly affair n we decided to give it a try and it was a positive experience. Prompt service. Good food. Nice place to have an occasion event.

I have now discovered a hidden pearl in Singapore. Great view, good layout, good food.
This restaurant will be on the rotation for key business dinners.
The wine selection was over priced which is the only negative I can add.
3
Food was ok but in comparison to other afternnon teas not so great. Need more savoury balance, portions were tiny.
5
Whether for a romantic or business dinner, highly recommend this excellent restaurant. Food and service were both impeccable.

The view was to die for! It was nice sunny day. That made the perfect view for our group . All of us went for the set lunch. The seabass was good and i love the scallops as entrees. Succulent, creamy ! However service staff seemed to mumble and rattle through their food introduction which made them incoherent to us.

Visited for afternoon tea with friends. Stupendous views - until the rainstorm arrived!, comfortable seating with tables nicely spaced out.Tea was poor value we thought, a few tiny nibbles and then scones which were so hard they could have doubled as cannonballs. Chocolate tart was lovely but generally we were underwhelmed by the food. Tea was refreshed on demand.Would only return to enjoy the views - which you can do anyway without having a meal. Overall this was a rather disappointing experience
5
From the moment you walk into the restaurant you are treated like a king. The wine and the food is just amazing. We did the degustation menu with wines. Everything matched perfectly. The staff are very attentive. They understand what it means to give great service. The views of Singapore are out of this world. A viewing walkway allows you to access many great, stunning views. Go go go and experience it for your self

Had the set lunch menu few days ago as part of a bussiness lunch meeting i had to attend , the dishes were nice , vibrant and fresh , with nice little touches of creativity , we were very proffessionally waited by the sala stuff as they were very attentive but also managed to stay in the shadows though out the lunch in order for us to enjoy , over all great and i ll be bac

Went there recently to celebrate my partner's birthday. The view from the restaurant is magnificent. Food was ok. They served us complimentary bread and chips while waiting for our food to be served which is nice.In order to get a table by the window, one would have to make the reservation well in advance.Overall, it was a nice dinner with a great view
5
Was here for my one year anniversary, view was awesome. Food was great. Ordered WOW package for 2 x photos and a really huge cake(they could make it smaller though as it was too much for us) and a stemmed rose. Overall, it is highly recommended
5
Went there my boyfriends birthday celebration. Got the WOW package as well. Totally worth it! Good food, ambience and staff were professional.
3
The menu is interesting but taste of food doesn't commensurate with what you pay. It may be compensated with the view you get perhaps once is enough
5
Great food, great wine, pricey but with the views, the service and the complimentary desert, was worth every cent.
Wonderful experience.

Dinner for two on a Saturday night. Pleasant cocktails beforehand and most obliging service. MaÃ®tre D' kindly asked us to wait a further 5 minutes while she arranged a window table - very thoughtful. Table service was attentive without crowding us. However our tablecloth was wet when we sat down which showed a lapse in attention to detail.Tempura Wasabi oysters were a real hit - can heartily recommend them if you have a robust appetite. My medium-rare sirloin was passable - nothing more. Just overdone and I suspect rested somewhere insufficiently warm.My partner had the chevre gnocchi which combined great flavor with top presentation. But too long in the pan left the gnocchi a little firmer than ideal. Her snapper fillet was beautifully done. I will go back for the location and the service and the oysters; and I will linger a little longer over the wine list next time. Its compendious, with something for all occasions. I will not pay the premium for the steak however
4
We had lunch at this restaurant recently and it was a great experience. We had set menu 3 course lunch for all of us and the foods was great, the service was quick and very profesionally waited. The total bill was SGD200+ for 4 off us plus the bonus was to look at the million dollars view. Will do it again soon
5
Salt Grill's system makes everything go smoothly, and the staff are very well trained. We wanted to be able to walk from the Marriott Tang Plaza to a reliably excellent dinner restaurant even if it was raining. We made a reservation at SALT Grill where we knew that the service and the food would be of a high standard. On a Saturday night we were given a table for two at the windows with a fine view of Singapore's residential area as the sun went down and commuters returned home and turned on the lights. Salt Grill has a large selection of wine by the glass, and we were able to choose a sweet wine, a moscato. We shared barramundi with truffle mashed potatoes, which was excellent, and for dessert we shared a cherry souffle. One unique advantage of Salt Grill is that after dinner, you can walk around the upper part of the restaurant, and when you take the elevator down, you are in the Ion shopping mall

This upmarket steakhouse is right at the top of the highest building in Orchard Road, and the panoramic views are excellent, so long as there is no haze weather around, of course. The menu is very much (though not exclusively) built around beef steaks of a number of varieties such as fillet, sirloin or scotch, with the word 'wagyu' much in use, and indeed when we were shown the steaks before ordering, many were marbled to various degrees. Rather surprisingly, though, given all the fuss, not one was from Japan. The steaks were cooked to the degree ordered by each of us, though they could have done with a little less salt. We had three courses each, and one glass of wine each. The Singapore $ was at parity with the Australian $ at the time, so 1 US $ was worth about Singapore $1.3 or thereabouts. The bill for four of us came to S$ 900. I rest my case. We will not again be paying that much for what amounts to steak and chips with a view

Had wonderful food, wine & view at Salt Grill & Sky Bar, Ion. Definitely a memorable one for me Last but not least, thanks to Dior SG for all the arrangement. For me: Lunch bring business associate or friends but Dinner definitely with my beloved ValentineP.S.: Lunch do offers set meal, very worth trying!
4
An unbelievable restaurant, great service, fantastic food quality. The ambiance at this restaurant is excellent low lighting with a great view from the 55th floor. The wine we selected was very very good. The overall experience at this restaurant was a very memorable,pleasant one. It was however fairly pricey but definitely worth the visit. We had 14 people at our table and averaged about $170-00 Singapore dollars including all drinks. Other than this, cannot fault this restaurant
5
As some of the family live in Johor and only go in rarely for celebrations, I chose this, having had a memorable lunch there a long while ago. there was a mix-up in the bookings as I thought I'd booked for a Pengwine event, but the restaurant recorded a regular booking. They were both apologetic and utterly hospitable with substantial nibbles and pricey mineral water, and it was not totally their fault (the booking form might have been clearer, and I should have checked). The sommelier and Pengwine accommodated us smoothly (we sat at a nearby table which was, frankly even more comfortable) and then not only gave us a special starter with the freshest smoked salmon and golden roe, but added at the end of the meal a beautifully decorated birthday dessert plate for the birthday celebrant. Without intruding the staff took very good care of us.Not a cheapo place, but for a truly spectacular evening this restaurant would be hard to beat
3
Views are great and restaurant is impressive.
Unfortunately, very overpriced. Alcohol is particularly overpriced.
Service was so-so.
3
Location is good, service was good, yet the food was just small notch below the fine dining, even though it was still tasty.
5
The food was great and the view was spectacular. Their set lunch are value for money! Overall I had a great experience. (:
3
Overall was great, service of waiter/waitress can be better!! Food was decent,nothing special.Sunset view was great.Did not get my seat near the window.
5
By far one of the restaurants with the best service and very value for money lunch sets. Premium wagyu rump, kurobuta pork and snapper served at a reasonable price. Definitely worth a second visit.

We were really looking forward to our first trip to Salt grill and Sky Bar. My 15 year old has wanted to go here since we moved to Singapore in July. Restaurant Week seemed like the perfect time to try it out. Certain restaurants had a $15 additional charge and this was one of them. That made the 3 course menu $58 / person. We had 3 entrees, 3 mains, and 2 desserts to choose from. My husband was out of town, so it was just me and my 2 boys. We were very impressed as we walked off the elevator and saw the gorgeous floor to ceiling windows. The views were spectacular! Unfortunately, we were walked up a long ramp to an upstairs area and sat in a corner. All of the restaurant week people were stuffed upstairs. Salt made a pretty big deal about canceling, calling us once and emailing us twice about the reservation. They also made a big deal about the dress code during the 3 check ins and a sign at the front desk. I was very surprised to see a man in jeans and sandals sitting at a prime window table. My 13 year old son was immediately and aggressively offered the kids menu. Seriously? My children have eaten at Michelin starred places around the world. We can handle the Salt menu. We were happy with the choices given and all of us ordered the snapper as a main and we had different entrees and desserts. Drinks were $10! A bottle of water was $13. 2 pieces of bread were given to each of us and our bread plates were whisked away after the bread was eaten. No more for us! The meal was weird. At times we felt rushed and at times we were left sitting there. The portions were small. Typical restaurant week sizes I guess. $58 / person would expect a little more. The presentation was lacking. So much so, none of us felt compelled to take any pictures of our food. We always take pictures of our food. It was sloppy and boring. My 15 year old enjoyed his sashimi salmon and I liked my tomato salad. The snapper was meh. My oldest son's was over done. My salmon had limp skin. The pearl risotto was very good. Too bad we only had a terribly small portion. The desserts were very good as well.We understand this is restaurant week, but these places need to think of this as opportunities to gain new business. The service should have been outstanding. It was not. The food presentation and quality should have been perfect. It was not. I'm not sure we will make it back here. We have had too many great meals in Singapore since moving here. I think we would rather spend our $800 elsewhere. It's really too bad Salt did not embrace this opportunity

Heard much about this fining dining restaurant, finally gave it a chance to try it out. Upon entering the restaurant, all was well until we were shown to our seats, and the waitress started to lay the napkin on your lap, oh mind, what a bad service we had experience, She just threw the napkin over my son's lap. What a disappointment how the fine dining restaurant had train their waitress? Thus we requested the manager that we do not want to be served by this particular waitress anymore. It was my anniversary celebration with my wife and we brought our 2 sons along and as it is a fine dining restaurant, I expected high price and high service performance. I am a season traveler and a businessman, I traveled and entertained a lot, but I was very disappointed to receive such service. But after told the manager (I think so, she was in coat, did not get her name), she was very professional, apologised on behalf of the waitress and served us together with another waitress. I must say the food is good though the steak price is expensive, as compared to Morton (just to mention one of the best known steak in USA. whichI had tried in Chicago, Boston, New York before) their steak was not as expected
5
Good foods and services and an excellent views of Singapore skyline. The main course we ordered the steak, salmon and chicken are well prepared. Nice layout and good presentation. The service staff are well trained with excellent service. The highlight is the view of Singapore skyline. The shopping areas and the Orchard residential areas. We are able to see the sunset while having our dinner. We have good memory of the birthday celebration and will be returning again. Thank you.

We came for my birthday celebration (7 pax) with my family. 6 of us ordered Set Lunch menu. My father ordered caviars.Pleasant ambience, nice presentation of food, and the view from level 55th Ion is a perfect location. Service is smooth and attentive to request / questions from us.Got surprise from the staff, since the set lunch came with dessert, for mine, they specially arranged with a birthday message (photo attached). Also they offer to take photos of us + giving out the print out for us to keep.Recommended for couple / family/ friends who'd like fancy dinner in the middle of the city
4
The view at Salt Grill, especially if you can snag a window seat is well worth making a reservation way in advance. The view just makes the dining experience so much better. Food is alright not wow, but the service and ambiance makes up the whole package when dining here. The wine list is pretty extensive and we had a bit of fun with guessing their mystery wine.
5
This was my 2nd visit, food and service was enjoyable. Great presentation and balance of taste. Great view!
4
Salt Grill offers a great view over Singapore, so if you are hosting people it's a great start, but the food, wine and service are also top notch and will impress any foodie.
5
A birthday celebration - excellent food and service with a view from the top of the world at the 56th level.
3
The food is decent and the service staff is generally attentive but could be more uniformly polite. The views are breathtaking but you have to reserve far in advance for the first row of seats by the window.

I had a more disappointing experience in the Salt Bar. Initially we wanted to reserve a table at the restaurant but there was nothing free.First the lady at the lobby struggled to find our reservation and we finally end up on a "we make some table ready" place which offered not a good view for all. Having that said the view is fantastic offering a broad scope from all the west of Singapore to the east. We ordered than Mojitos which had been very reasonable in the Happy Hour and tasty.After that we went to the tapas which had been also good, nice Tuna tartar on crispy fish skin, very good seared scallops, ok oysters (had better once) and a good salmon sashimi. Afterwards we had been only able to choose from a limited bar menu and we all took a Waguye Burger. The burger cost 45SGD, 50SGD if you like to add cheese on it. Our expectation was high and overall the burger was disappointing. The meet (not minced) was cooked very nicely medium but the presentation was without love and the burger bun way to thick. If it was about that so far I would give a 3 or 4 but the reason why I give a 2 was about the wine. We followed the recommendation of the sommelier and ordered a 180SGD bottle of Bourdeaux. When it came the smell was nice but the wine was way to cold and said to the sommelier it is nice but too cold. His reply was "Oh no it is 16 degree just right and it will warm up" - believe me this was never 16 degree more like out of the fridge and warming up in a room which is cooled down to around 20 degree might be difficult. I did not complain further which was a mistake because we for sure normally nice wine was not developing the full taste, always a little bit too sour and for that experience way too expensive! We ended with desserts which was again good but overall I would not go back to the place since the overall experience was not worth the ~700SGD we paid.
5
This restaurant possesses a unique advantage: its location. Located the 56th floor of ION Orchard, you are able to see a breathtaking panoramic view of Singapore, peppered with a few interesting facts and quotes about the sky here and there. The food and service were excellent, the squid-ink chips, in particular, almost became my new favourite snack. However, the truffle fries were soggy, tasted horrible
4
The service and view at Salt Grill is truly extraordinary! The small gestures, such as placing my napkin back on the side of the armchair when I went to toilet and constantly filling our glasses with water, the servers were efficient and gracious! We tried the degustation menu, at $150 per person, and added another main of barramundi fish, and a couple of Australian sling to boot! Spent a total of $500, and despite being very expensive, was a wonderful experience. The food was generous in portion, had flavour, and was fresh. Will return in the future, probably when the restaurant has gained a Michelin star, or two, in which I think it deserves. Recommended for their value degustation and lunch sets, though making reservations is tough as the place is crowded ever so often, so book early please
5
Other than the Australian waitress who was...... just cranky. Our overall experience there was great! We love the service by everyone else, the food was pretty good and most importantly the view was amazing, we saw the sun set and had dinner till it was dark. Will definitely return!
5
Had a business meal here and was very impressed. Food was served in just the right proportions and was beautifully cooked. We took the set menu, and everything served looked excellent. If you want a lighter meal the Gnocchi was absolutely delightful and very tasty. Plus the restaurant has the most incredible view, something you donâ€™t get every day in London. I would definitely recommend for lunch or dinner when in Singapore.
4
This is definitely a restaurant with an expansive view of the Singapore city skyline! Try to reach the restaurant around 6:15-6:30pm and you will be able to spend some time before dinner to see the evening skyline, which is still reasonably bright at that time! And by the time you get some drinks and start ordering your food, the skyline will turn into a night scenery with blazing lights all around. The service is very prompt and the waiters and waitresses will explain the food on the menu clearly to you. For example they will even show you the different cuts of the steak that are available so that you can make a more informed choice. The starters are great and oysters are really fresh. Besides steak, they also offer some choices of fish. However the portions is reasonably sized and not big. They have a good selection of wine available to diners
4
Fantastic food in a setting overlooking views of Singapore Skyline.
The Prawn starter and Steak was amazing , well done with impeccable service always
4
Booked last minute and were seated by the window with great view. Food is of a good standard but very expensive.
3
Scones should not be served with whipped cream. Period. Ambience and cleanliness was exceptional. Was given the best view in the house. Staff was friendly. However, no introduction to the high tea set was given.
5
Been there multiple times, service has always been excellent. The ambience is great too, do take a stroll around the circular walkway, the night view is best in my opinion.
5
Celebrated my birthday here tonight and our experience was nothing but fabulous. The food was exquisite and our server, Belle was attentive and extremely helpful with recommending what's good on the menu. Perfect place for a celebration or a romantic dinner with your loved one. We will definitely come back here. Soon
5
We were invited by friends and had never been to SALT before and we are so glad e accepted their invitation. From thee first meeting downstairs to our welcome upstairs, everything was top tier. The bread was superb - lights and not overly starchy. We had the burrata cheese entree and it was very good. The tomatoes could have been fresher and less green, but it was a small oversight. The gift from the chef of chips and Pate was most welcome. We had the snapper and it was moist and delicious. The ink risotto was an squired taste, but a welcome offset to the fish. Nicely done. My Manhattan perfect was just that - perfect! And it enhanced an already great view. SALT is now my standard for 5 star reviews.
3
We decided to go to this bar after our last dinner in Singapore. The location is marvelous, you can admire the entire Singapore skyline from here. We had two very nice cocktails and a couple of high-quality desserts. We were very happy with the quality offered as well as with the service. The location is really beautiful and it is worth a visit. However I believe the prices are absolutely too high.
5
My partner knew that I loved this restaurant the previous time we visited, and decided to book it for my birthday dinner treat.There's something about a restaurant located 50+ levels above ground, the experience feels surreal and I was no less fascinated than the first time I visited. Service was prompt and polite, and our request for a seat on the upper deck was quickly acknowledged and arranged.Food was served promptly and well explained by the staff, though I certainly prefer the meats and will give the sides a miss. The waiters did manage to find out that it was my birthday despite my partner not telling them during her reservation. They even arranged for a complimentary cake and a photo of that special evening.Really a fine dining experience and one that I will recommend
1
made early reservation for afternoon tea for my wife's birthday. One hour before appointed time, when we settled our infant with the nanny and were ready to go, the reservation dept called to say that they were unable to fulfill our request as the air con was spoilt since morning and they were unable to fulfill our reservation. while i understand that technical issues pop out time to time, the fact that they didn't inform us when it happened (earlier in the morning) so I could come up with a backup, but right before reservation just showed lack of foresight and trustworthiness. A special day ruined.
5
I visited here after enjyied ION Sky for free.Soon reserved this restaurant for dinner.To see night view we must have dinner or bar.Here landscape is excelent because 215m high is highest in Singapore.And food is excellent too.Thre is presentation for meat menue by staff and it makes special feeling for guests.All meat menue looks fine, I ordered aged beef 250g as 85SGD.For appetizer I order octopus, it cocked soft and taste good.Here is good for special day and business use.Manager advised lunch menue is less than 50SGD with 3 cource.We will visit again
4
Nice place and good food when we have our romantics dinner .
Good services and frenziedly staff and we have great time during the dinner
4
It's a nice & comfortable place to dine with your loved ones. Excellent service & the set lunch was just perfect for me.
4
A restaurant with a nice view to enjoy the afternoon tea with the ladies. Ordered the afternoon tea set n it was ok. Portion was rather small.
5
I visited the restaurant 2 weeks ago with my boyfriend for our anniversary dinner. The food was great and the staff were very attentive and knowledgeable about their menu. Great experience!
5
Impressed by the food, service staff is attentive n able to explain what is being served. Wkday set lunch is def value for money. The view is breath-taking.
5
I tried getting a table here at 7pm on a Friday night and luckily there was space available (albeit with a slight restricted view). You access via the ION mall and an elevator takes you up to the 55th floor. The entry staff are very friendly and helpful, giving a personalized service. The views from the top are pretty incredible with a near 360 panoramic. I was on an upper level looking down and out albeit with a slight restriction near to a pillar. The design is slightly odd in that the walkway takes all the window space with everyone sat in the middle; so could have been designed differently I think. However you should get a good view across Singapore even if you take a wander...Nevertheless this is a good restaurant with a good European-style menu and good wine list. Expect to pay more than Michelin-priced food for slightly less quality - but these are Singapore prices. The baked bone-marrow and Wagyu steak were both really very good but there was a limited wine-by-the-glass menu. I paid $260 for my three course and would happily revisit next time I am in town. The service staff are quite happy and knowledgeable too
2
Salt and grill is very surprising that so famous australian food restaurants and with the very nice views have a very unhigyen staff what I saw today when I visited accidental ion sky disgusti I saw a waitress was cut nails in the sky bar. .huh..disgusting
4
Had dinner there. Given table right against the window. Great view and we got to see the sunset. Had the sashimi salmon and the fillet steak. Very good but a little pricey for me. With modest drinks, bill was S$380 for two and no desert. Bar area was quiet but it was a Monday evening. Staff were very attentive. Service was fantastic right from reception on level 4. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience.
5
Huge floor-to-ceiling full-glass windows at Level 55 with panoramic view. A gorgeous restaurant great for couples to experience a romantic dinner, it's also a stunning place to enjoy high-tea with friends. Although the restaurant may not offer the best gourmet in town, the beautiful atmosphere makes it all worthwhile. Sum it up - cozy restaurant settings, fantastic high floor views, nice food and great services.
5
It's not often a restaurant gets all the ingredients right--ambience, view, service and food, but Salt grill & Sky Bar pulls it all off. Fabulous view (book for 7:00 so you get the daylight, sunset and night views over Singapore) that crosses half of the island all the way to the sea. The menu focuses on grill food (as the name indicates) with a very nice array of cuts of beef to satisfy any taste (plus a few other entries--lamb, chicken, fish) and a good range of starters. Excellent wine list. We shared a starter and the chateaubriand for two, and when I asked for horseradish and was clearly disappointed when they said they didn't have any, a quick query to the chef brought within minutes a dish of made-to-order perfect, freshly-grated-and-whipped-with-cream horseradish, making my meal perfect. The ambience was also perfect--buzzy but not noisy, with the right number of happy diners and none of that glass & steel harshness that ruins so many of today's restaurants. S$550 for a meal for two isn't inexpensive but you get what you pay for--in our case, two glasses of champagne, two glasses and one bottle of wine, a shared starter and the chateaubriand for two. We'll be back
5
Excellent dining experience with a view. the oysters were delish as were the cocktails we sampled. The set lunch menu though value for money wasn't outstanding nor memorable.
4
Nice view and great service. I didn't try many dishes so cannot comment much. But the steak I ordered was okay, too oily for me.
5
My whole family enjoyed the food and service. Service crew are attentive and my parents enjoyed themselves thoroughly
5
Very attentive service. They even realised the kitchen missed out on the cheese in our entree. It's pricey for the food but it was a special occasion. All good and can't wait to bring my kids for our anniversary.
5
The afternoon tea set is reasonably priced and the food quality is good. The view is awesome and the environment of the restaurant is fantastic. Quiet enough for a great catchup with friends over good food.
5
Celebrated my 18th Birthday here and their services to serve and to surprise is out of this world. Definitely would go again for any other occasion.
5
Business meeting here with a large group sett up at the last minute, the restaurant was very accommodating. Lovely choices of fish very well prepared. Good sashimi appetizer, expensive selection of wines. Food is $$$$ but good. The view from the 55th floor is spectacular and the sunset truly amazin
4
The restaurant is on the top floor of the Orchard ION center...around 50 stories up!. We went to dinner just at sunset...what a spectacular view. They have a walkway to the top with a great viewing area that let's you look down on the skyline of Singapore. The food is relatively expensive. I had the least expensive main dish...sea bass...at around 55 sing dollars just for the main. Entrees are relatively small but flavorful...I had the seared scallops. Service was attentive and classy. Overall, expect to spend at least 100 sing per person for dinner, excluding drinks. Food was good, but not spectacular for the price paid. The views, though, made it a very enjoyable experience
3
I put in a request for window seating during booking and I understand that there is no guarantee. On our visit, we were told that the window seats were fully taken. However, throughout our entire 2 hrs there for the afternoon tea, I counted at least 2-3 window seats that were empty and unoccupied which signaled to me poor organization & handling of diners' requests. For the price paid, the food & service were nothing to shout about either so it is unlikely we will make another visit back

After read all the positive reviews about this restaurant, I got really excited and tried to make a reservation for dinner in August for a special occasion. I wrote in, no reply from the restaurant, I thus called in a while ago (@2045hrs on 1 July-Singapore time). A female staff answered my call, after I mentioned that I would like to make a reservation in August, she questioned me back in an extremely arrogant and provoking tone ,'Huh..August!!???' I was shocked that such a fine-dining restaurant with reputable chefs and sophicated ambience allows such a hostile staff handling reservation. I found it unbelievable and asked if they are able to take reservation in August, the said staff tried her upmost best to make me feel I'm indeed stupid to make such a reservation request, 'Oh of course! We only take reservation 1 month before the date!..' I didn't even get a chance to mention the date for my reservation before she carried lecturing me on their policies. Well, it's a pity that we won't be able to experience this restaurant since this female staff has succeeded in turning us away, nonetheless, not a great loss since there are plenty of fine dining restaurants in Singapore. Well, perhaps this restaurant has overwhelmingly good business, however, were I the owner, I would at least tell this staff not to give customers such a hard time just because they try to make reservation a few days earlier than your 'policy'. Company pays her salary, she has no right to chase away interested customers by embarrassing them
5
We totally enjoyed ourselves. Ordered a 500g steak to share between 2 adults and 1 child, which was delicious! The oysters were so fresh! Definitely worth the money.
4
Went here with friends, the food was scrumptious.
Had a medium steak and truffle mash. Scallops to start. Service was attentive, the dedicated elevators to the 55th floor are a lovely addition as is the viewing deck with the binoculars.
Enjoy, I sure did.
5
Think Quay Restaurant Sydney & The Glass House in Hobart.
Fresh ingredients, care, imagination, skill and attention to detail.
Great wait staff and ambience and the view is sensational – thoroughly enjoyable!
5
Me and my friend took advantage of their Restaurant Week promotion and had lunch here to see what's the hype all about.My 3 course meal was consist of Glass Sydney Crab Omelette, Duck Leg Confit, and salt Choco Mousse. Maintaining a high standard I bet is one of their top priorities as it is evident with the ingredients used in the food, the impeccable service, while me and my friend were savouring every single bite that we devoured at down to the last crumb and sauce.If you have the budget, and want to impress your date, I'd say go for it, don't mind burning a hole in your wallet as long as you make her tummy happy. I'd say this place is a good place to go for special occasions, during restaurant week promotions, or if one is so sick and tired of eating pork lard laden hawker food and want to take a break, for a change

There is a reason why Chef Luka Mangan doesn't have a restaurant in Melbourne. Despite hailing from Victoria himself, he had to launch out to Asia to start his restaurant empire purely because he just isn't good enough. Visiting the restaurant just 2 nights ago, I was eager to try some "home" food after a while, but was severely disappointed by the overly complicated dishes offered at Salt Grill. They could have easily done without the heap of XO sauce on the beautiful scallop or the chucky bacon bits on the Sirlion. But apparently, more is value in Singapore. Less, is always more - even if you have to charge an arm and a leg for it.The view is nothing to gawk about - maybe MBS is a better location than Orchard Road. I think I will stick to local hawker food in Singapore from now on
4
Lucky to have had a window seat to take in the magnificent views. The food was nice, but to be honest i've had better. The liquorish desert was very nice though. The service was good and the waitress was able to answer my questions. i had the salmon main, which was nice, but a little on the bland side. An expensive place to dine in, especially as the food was not as great as other restaurants. But a nice place to dine on a special occasion

I just had an amazing dining experience. Straight up she went a Negroni. "Best I've ever had doll", she said. She then had the Salt salad with truffled burrata, slow cooked egg, endive, lentils and seasonal vegetables to start. I had the Australian salmon sashimi washed down with a glass of Australian Sav Blanc. After that we shared ( fought over lol) the pork and slow cooked duck. The staff were attentive and conversational about food and wine. The service was impeccable.I will be back again. I might leave her behind

Went for last minute dinner so window seats weren't available. We were given a seat that still allow us to have some nice view thou. Staffs were attentive and came to our table every now and then to ensure everything is good for us. For appetiser, we ordered a scallop dish and for the mains, we ordered their kurobuta set and a salmon set and 2 drinks. The scallops were fresh and nicely cooked with light seasoning. Their kurobuta chop was marinated well and grilled just nice, every bite of the chop was filled with aromas and easy to chew. As for the salmon set, we will not try again. Salmon was not too fresh, it tastes rather fishy and bland, so not worth the price. We decided to let it be since their staffs were friendly and nice, we do not want to cause any unpleasantness. We spent about $230++ for 2 pax. Worth for the ambient but not so much for the food actually

Firstly , an apology for the lateness of this review . My husband suffered an accident whilst we were in Vietnam & that & other circumstances have meant reviews are very belated ! This place was a real surprise find . We were escorted in the dark to the lift & up to the 55th floor . What great views - we were there for lunch but it would be even better at night.The service was excellent & the shared platter was large & really good value.Would recommen

Salt Grill offers stunning views out over the city - on a clear night you can see for miles from the 55th floor and Singapore is spread out before you like a glittering tableau. The food is equally good, with emphasis on choice cuts of meat, exquisitely prepared. My duck breast was melt in the mouth tender and the parmesan fries which accompanied it were perfect, as was the asparagus as a side. You won't see much change from $100 for a single portion of steak and chips, so Salt Grill is definitely a treat. There is a $150++ degustation menu as well.The kids menu is especially noteworthy - one of the best I have seen for children in a fine dining establishment anywhere in the world. It is incredible value at 25++ and the quality of the food was brilliant. The chocolate fondant and ice cream was a very generous portion that my ten year old loved.The wine list encompasses everything from $15 glasses of Australian red to $1500 vintage bottles of Krug. The service was fine. The bread and dukkeh and oil was very average, however. Perhaps change bakery?Valet parking is available at just $4... so if you are not drinking, drive there

The ambience was fantastic up on Level 55 of Ion. However the afternoon tea set was rather disappointing, was expecting more savoury items but there were only 3 out of 9.
4
Stopped in for cocktails & nibbles
at bar staff very attentive & all worth the visit.. Just a bit chilly from a/c Like to have dinner next time . That may be five stars maybe take jacket.
5
Happy Hour! Beautiful Views! Great Service! Perfect Cocktails! Tasty Bites! Just the right spot out for a late afternoon outing with my sister and niece before our big night out on the town. This was a PERFECT STARTER...prices are good too! Enjoy...
5
It is expensive but still dependent on the dishes ordered.
Really fresh ingredients and the oysters i tried were simply awesome.
Was told batch of oysters differ on a monthly basis.
Do place reservations early for a good view!
5
Nice setting with nice view. Staff knowledgeable & friendly. Able to make recommendations. Food is tasty & presentation is nice. Overall, a nice dining experience.
4
Service could have been better, but I suppose we were all too busy with the views anyway. Food was good, almost with a fusion twist.
5
Excellent food, attentive service, lovely view. A perfect lunch in a relaxing and unrushed atmosphere.
5
Its hard to believe a dining experience gets any better than this. The incredible views from the top of Ion of Singapore just add to the whole experience as soon as you enter.We had the DÃ©gustation menu which is 6 courses plus accompanying wines. I cannot use enough adjectives to describe how great every dish wash. Naturally sampling small portions of all of the chef's signature dishes in one sitting should be magnificent and it truly was.The sashimi dish of Tasmanian salmon was absolute perfection.The accompanying wines were great and just added to the whole meal.The ambiance of Salt Grill combined with the views just adds to the whole experience.Finally the service from the staff here was truly memorable. They are absolute professionals and just add so much to the whole experience

I visited Salt Grill & Sky Bar at Ion Orchard a number of times and I keep going back. The reasons are simple:- Good food- Great service- Nice viewWhile prices can be on the high side, its worth going back in my opinion. The crab omelette remains a classic and a great tasting dish. During my last visit this week, I had tuna for a main and it was tasty
4
I went to level 4 of the ION Orchard, then saw the concierge at counter . She asked me whether I came to Salt Grill for meal. I replied 'Afternoon tea '' since it was already 2.30 pm.She then asked me to register and led me to the lift which took me to Level 55.There, people was there to receive me and led me to seat , near the window. Can see nice view of building and window ceiling.3 tier set and a plate of scone were served along with a glass of champagne.There diners are mainly young ladies.Foods and service were good. but only bad point is that celing made of glass.. When there is overhead sun, can you read msg from the phone?At the end, I was served coffee.bill is over $60 inclusive of GST and service charge
5
We had a lovely dinner with a nice view.
Friend with Celiac's was very well taken care of, including separate gluten free bread, and adjusting the meal to meet her dietary needs. Everything was lovely.
5
They gave us free ice cream dessert and free photo print out for memory!! We went there on a rainy day so the view was not that fantastic but still worth a try.
4
Enjoyed a lunch outing with friends from out of town. We enjoyed the view although a bit hazy that Saturday. The set lunch was a good choice. The meals were constructed well with a very smooth balance to the palate.
5
Good was extremely delightful.
Service was impeccable!
With the amazing view, it's a great place to celebrate birthdays or anniversaries.
3
Some staff were unfriendly . The seems to be short of ground floor workers. Overall they did manage my birthday surprise for my friends even though I wrote done on the reservation booking application.
5
I ate here with two colleague the last week of May.The online booking process was smooth. On arrival at the reception desk on level 4, we were welcomed and shown to the private lift upto floor 55.The service from start to finish was second to none. The views are fabulous and the ambience electric. We all ate the steak with truffle butter and sweet potato fries. It was cooked to perfection and the truffle butter enhanced the steak rather than overpowering as truffle sometime can be.They've got a great cocktail and wine menu too.The staff were very attentive and no glass ever made it empty before we were asked if we wanted another drink. Highly recommend for any occasion!
3
Was a surprise dinner for a colleague. The views are spectacular, the Resturant is nice. Service fantastic. The entree was tasty but the main was very disappointing - wagu rump...was tough to eat. Hard to cut and chewy. No marbling at all in the steak. Several of us had it and all had the same comment
3
Enjoyed a few drinks at the Sky Bar. A Luke Mangan establishment. Orchard Road is the Mecca for shoppers and diners and Ion Orchard is no exception. Great views in a modern atmosphere. Bar prices are as high as the 55th floor and that is what you would expect in this location. I was a little disappointed with the slow service but it was not something that truly detracted given that we spent the waiting time enjoying the views. On an interesting note, I asked for a caipirinha and was disappointed to find out that they do not have cachaca. For an establishment of that stature and scope...
5
I booked a table for 4 for my husband's birthday last Wed. We were allocated a table by the window & as it was a clear evening, the view from the 55th floor was amazing, the service is excellent, though it is a bit pricey but the quality of the food is very good.

I had read about the Salt Grill and Sky Bar on a top ten list and having been to the other establishments we wanted to give Salt Grill a go. We went at 9pm on a Friday night and it wasn't too busy. We got to ION and found the restaurant, after a quick elevator ride we walked into a beautiful view of the city. Our table wasn't ready so we got sat at the bar and ordered a drink. We ordered from the cocktail list which were all $20+ but the Garden Goose was a really good choice and easy to drink. After 5mins we got taken to our table which was right by the window. The view was stunning with all the city lit up at night. We ordered the Grilled Barramundi which came with 2 large prawns and a thai salad, the fish was small but the meal was very good! We also ordered the Lamb Rack which was also small but very tasty. We split some truffle fries and ordered another round of drinks before finishing up our meal. The view is absolutely worth it and would be highly recommended for a sunset afternoon early dinner! After dinner we enjoyed the view and walked around getting the most out of the 360 view.The meal was very good, and the view was amazing. The only problem being ION closing and us struggling to find our way out of the mall
4
We had lunch at Saltgrill. Food was very good, but service was slow and straitfaced. Remind the dressing code - wear at least smart casual.
4
The best place about this is the views. The food is nice but not worth going back for unless you want to take guests there for the views. It's also quite $$
Worth a try
3
Written in the remarks that we were celebrating our anniversary and they prepared a surprise cake for us and printed a photograph of us to keep. We were also treated to a special appetiser on the house by the Chef before our meals. Great service!
5
Enjoyed the service and food. Efforts made to explain the meat cuts and food portions were value-for-money. Too full to try desserts, so next time!
4
This is a small restaurant and a very high point of Orchard road. Very nice ambience
Food was good - sashimi was so good, Pork main also good and nice tomato and burrata salad.
5
I came here again with my family as they were visiting in Singapore and they mentioned they felt like a souffle. I remembered that Salt had an excellent souffle, but the experience I had prior to this was not great. However, I decided to give it another shot.When we arrived, they remembered that I was upset with my previous experience and greeted with very warmly. Almost every staff in the restaurant went out of their way to apologise for the previous incident and it felt quite genuine. In addition to this, they gave us the 2 souffles complimentary as well as some of the best service I've had in Singapore. I would say this was in my top 3 experiences I've ever had in Singapore and I really appreciate the efforts of the manager, Tony, and the receptionist (I didn't get her name). Thank you for the excellent experience and I look forward to returning to Salt Grill & Sky Bar time and time again

Lunch for 6.As per title, Views are lovely.Food quality was Ok. Nothing to shout about but definitely I expected much better given this is a Luke M restaurant.Service was poor.Hostess was good.Wines were good. Rest Manager recommended a good wine to pair.Wait staff was bad. 1 could not even articulate clearly what was being served. I had to ask twice for her to speak slowly so we could figure what she was saying.Also- We enquired politely at the end of the meal about the Set Lunch. On the Menu it was stated as a Whole Chicken. But we were served was looked like half a Baby Chicken. Our query to the wait staff was "Is it Whole or Half"? And all she could say was it is a Small Portion. I explained- I am not contesting the size or portion, I am merely trying to figure if we read wrongly.She escalated to the Rest Manager and he came back to explain it was Full Chicken but W/O the Wings and also Deboned so that it was easy to eat. So Less both Wings, it was also bar the Bone and some Meat a Whole Chicken. Our business lunch looked at each other and couldn't convince ourselves this was correct. Silly explanation. I would rather you update your Menu so that people don't even have to have you explain this.Overall- Not worth the effort. A lot more places in Singapore worth the view, your time, your meal, at this price
5
Amazing view and food. One of the best so far in Singapore, not a single thing from the food that might be improved (perhaps the none specials French Fries). Salmon tartar with beautiful flavors and the Wagyu Rump to die for...then finish off with the 80% Chocolate Molton Cake. Compared to the very well known celebrity chef restaurants in MBS shopping mall, this restaurant has a much better location and view. Food in my personal opinion even slightly better
3
Called in advance to inform them I will be bringing my wife for her birthday celebration. Informed them upfront, I would like 1 of their best seats in the restaurant which they can't confirm at that point of time but they did it anyway. They said I could order dessert and they could write the wishes for her on the dessert. Service could be better because literally we need to keep calling them even to fill up the glass. Don't expect good view compare to Equinox because you will be seeing high rise rooftop surrounding. If you are willing to spend additional $30-$50, Equinox will be a better choice.
4
No doubt about it the view is fantastic but a friend and I had a mid-week dinner at Salt and thought the atmosphere was too corporate. Perhaps it's better on a weekend. We had a lovely table by the window. Service was excellent. Great wine list. Delicious oysters, extremely fresh and meaty. But the fish main course we had to share was pretty average. The bar area needs a serious makeover, it's sterile and soulless. The bar area is supposed to be welcoming, this was a far cry from that. Overall it's good but not great.
4
nice food and wonderful atmosphere with great view. Waiter is very friendly however, waitress is a bit not friendly. Birthday wisher dish design made us privileged. great place to explore
5
Awesome ambience. Gf love the food and the atmostsphere. A perfect place to bring someone special on a special occasion.
4
Was welcomed by friendly staff who guide us to the lift to level 55. The view was expectional and the staffs were very friendly..

Food was good and price is reasonable. Could have more choice to choose for the set lunch. Will come again.

Yesterday was my second visit to Salt Grill, though it was only lunch, i received prompt and thoughtful service. i've made reservations for 2 to celebrate birthday for my partner and received an email giving me suggestions on things i can do to make the celebration extra special (exp.: have wordings on dessert/ order a cake etc.) They even called to confirm, service was on a personal level, very impressive. Needless to say my partner was impressed with the whole experience, beautiful food, service and atmosphere. She was blown away :) We were also given a complimentary photo print out, value added where ever they can. Service, food was consistent from the first time i visited (which was 1.5 year ago), this will always be the first place i'll think of for celebrations of any special events. Great job guys
5
It was a birthday treat for my husband and I've gotten their WOW package, which he has no idea about this little arrangement. Staffs are really polite and prompt in their services. Food was great. One suggestion to them though: for photo-taking, perhaps choose a better timing when customers are not chewing food, or having food in their mouth. Kind of awkward~It was still a really nice dinner we had. Would love to come back again really soon!

I had a business lunch at Salt Grill & Sky Bar.Pros: - Service: the service was impeccable as the staff paid attention to detail from start to finish.- Food: We ordered entrees and starters which included the salt salad, confit & foie gras and truffle fries. I felt that the foie gras was prepared to standard as it melted when in the mouth. It wasn't suppose to be overly-jelly feeling nor slightly tangy. For mains, we ordered the Rangers Valley Sirloin and the Kurobuta Pork. I was told that the Sirloin was prepared well to taste and tenderness. As for the Kurobuta Pork, it was a good mix of taste of salt, crispiness and the taste of roast pork. And because it was a business lunch, we were in no hurry to finish our food. The food tasted good from serving to end. For desserts, we ordered the sorbet, crumps & berries and the dessert of the day, which was the chocolate mousse. It was splendid. It was sweet and yet not overwhelming, with a good balance. In all, it was a good place to have lunch based on service, quality of food and setting.

My girlfriend and I was here for lunch during restaurant week after we saw lots of good review, the food were great with nice ambience. The service crews are great such as explaining the food, paying attention when our drink ran out. It was a cozy and chill feeling when you are dinning inside which makes the whole dining experience excellent
4
Another fine dining experience in Singapore and with a view to match. My wife and I enjoyed Good Friday lunch and enjoyed the sights with a window seat. Excellent service and high standards all round. I have to say the Kingfish Sashimi was truly excellent but the whole meal was top quality. Highly recommende

Quick dining with friends.
All enjoy cocktails and quick tapas.
Nice view and good location.
Restaurant close early...

Had dinner here with husband last month. The views were fantastic, food was great and service from the staffs were excellent. one minus point would be the insufficient lighting for menu reading. Overall a great dinning experience, will be back for sure.
5
Nice view, great staff, good food.
Poor ground staff, look and question us like we are trespassing. :(

Top quality steak, fantastic service and great ambience! Even though, it was very expensive but it is worth it. Will definitely go back again!

Awesome ambience
Great food
Good service
Nice view
Would have been 5 stars but the cost pulls it down a little

Heard about the great views so decided to have dinner here. The views did not disappoint and on a clear day there is almost a 360 deg scene of the Singapore skyline, from the iconic Marina Bay Sands to Keppel Bay, and from Toa Payoh to Marine Parade.Getting into the restaurant was kind of odd, as the reception area is part of the Ion's information desk near Crate & Barrel. Thereafter, you walk past a small open gallery-like area showcasing Chinese watercolours, calligraphy and paintings to get into the lift that will whisk you to the 55 and 56 floors. Once there, you walk along an elevated skywalk with floor to ceiling windows with that stupendous view to your table on the upper level. If you are in a large group, they will seat you on the lower level, near the kitchen or the bar.Foodwise, though, it did not quite match the views. My wife had the salmon sashimi, which was quite nice. I went for the signature glass Sydney crab omelette - while the enoki mushrooms were tasty, the omelette and the broth were rather too salty. We had the confit duck leg as one of the mains, and it was very dry in certain parts and rather salty. The lentils were also rather hard and crunchy. The pan fried snapper was okay, and the skin was crispy, and we loved the coconut infused risotto.We also liked the raspberry and pistachio flan, and the salty chocolate mousse was okay.Setvice was okay as well upstairs. The server broke one of the glass candle holders but was apologetic and was quick to sweep the broken pieces away
3
Food was so so. They're service crew doesn't go the extra mile to serve you. Doesn't even smile or say "you're welcome" when we thank them. The only good staff was they're sommelier. We expected more for the price we're paying, but they delivered way less. The ambiance and view is fantastic. Other than that, nothing special.
4
The night didn't quite start off well, with wrongly ordered bellinis to overcooked mains ( we ordered the kurobota pork and the NZ sirloin steak) but I must say that the staff, particularly Tony Tan, the restaurant manager, more than redeemed themselves with his well meaning demeanor, quick replacements of our mains and the complimentary wine and dessert gestures. Definitely worth a second chance.Ps. The person who called to reconfirm our reservation , someone by the name of Fadzilla, needs retraining in telephone manners and hospitality service delivery . Instead of asking to reconfirm, she used the word 'remind' and was extremely mechanical in her way of stating rules.

In Summary:Fantastic experience and a great restaurant for more than special occasions.*DETAILED REVIEW BELOW*Background:Celebrated a belated Valentine’s Day at this restaurant. Reservations were made in advance.1. Service – 4.5 out of 5We arrived early and were unfortunately asked rudely by the counter staff at Orchard ION level 4 to wait. Things got much better after that as we were led into a private and futuristic corridor and took the elevator to the restaurant. We were seated shortly soon after and the waitress took her time to explain the various meat the restaurant offered that evening. At no point did we feel ignored and one of the male waiters, presumably French, made the effort to check on our level of satisfaction from time to time. When settling the bill, I tried my luck with one of my cards which may have hit its limit. Eventually, I was told by the Chinese manager that it really did reach its limit. However, I was impressed by how tactful and nice he was and how he did his best to approach me while my partner went off to the ladies to save me some embarrassment. The bill took a while to come due to this little incident but my partner and I had a good laugh after that.2. Ambiance – 5 out of 5Nothing short of breathtaking. The view above the Orchard shopping district and the Singapore skyline during the golden hour is an experience to remember. Highly recommended for special occasions with families and romantic dates. Not good for first dates though as you will be hard-pressed to maintain this standard.3. Cleanliness – 5 out of 5Restaurant is sparking clean. Even if it weren’t, you will be too distracted by the scenery to notice anything.4. Taste – 5 out of 5I used to drink more but limit myself to a simple cocktail nowadays. The cocktail had a nice bitter aftertaste despite its feminine look. The foie gras dish was well presented and went well with the bread that was constantly replenished. Not forgetting the complementary starters, we were already half full by the time the mains arrived. However, the mains were done so well that we finished everything. The aged steak has a nice smoky and crisp exterior without being overcooked while the Kurobuta pork was well marinated and flavourful. We were surprised by the truffle fries as we were advised to take a single portion and it was almost too much for two to finish. The licorice dessert was the bonus as we did not have space left for a dessert each and tried it out of greed. The licorice was not overly strong while the sourness of the green apple did much to complement the spice.5. Value for Money – 4.5 out of 5It may be slightly pricey but for an evening of good food and ambience, it is well worth the money
4
This place was pretty good. Service and Food were pretty good. Ambience was nice and so were the cocktails. If you like a good cocktail - this is a place to go too. If you want to bring your love ones for a classy and romantic dinner - this is a place. Of course the price is higher from mid range
3
The lunch menu is of good value and quality. The service was attentive and prompt. The ingredient were of high quality and the chef did a fantastic job on presentation and taste.
5
What an experience with this! Absolutely fantastic place to have a romantic meal. The food is excellent, wine is fine and the view is exceptional. It is very pricey, but a good experience.
5
We enjoyed the evening as the service provided to us was as good as their food were. Highly recommended!

İt has a gorgeous view on the 50. Floor of ion place.the service is good the meat was wonderful and the wines were good enogh.the weather helped us and we had a wonderful view
4
My friend brought me here for a birthday treat. We had high tea set for 2. After we saw the lunch menu, we should have come for the lunch instead. The price was quite close and more value for money if we were to choose lunch. However, we just stick to high tea as it has past lunch hour.The hi tea set tasted average, truffles fries is not the best. But the best thing is the ambience and service. The place is quiet for chit chatting with magnificent orchard view. One of the crew requested to help us take a photo, we agreed. We were shocked when they presented me a plate of dessert (an ice cream with happy birthday) on it together with the photo she took for us. We even requested her to sent the photo to our email and she did.Great service! Keep it up!Worth dinning here
4
Nice experience with great view. Food was excellent with only 1 small flaw overall with the service of one staff. Was greeted with a rather brisk attitude from a service staff when one of us requested for a change of dessert. She could have just tell us we cannot request for a change as its already been prepared and we would understand. She just glared at us and walk off to the kitchen counter without saying anything, leaving us all dumbfounded. We did get the change but that weird glare was very bad service in my opinion.
5
Service, food, wine, views, this place has it all. We knew of Luke Mangan, but to transfer his Australian skill to Singapore and maintain the standards is remarkable. What a wonderful night, no matter the weather, you will enjoy and we will return for a spectacular sunset as that would ensure perfection.
4
Great food, great atmosphere, great food! However do try to avoid rainy day as you will not be able to enjoy the view from 55th/56th storey. Had a barramundi to share for 2, the fish is really good! and do try their truffle mashed potatoes, it will leave you drooling for more
4
A nice and quiet location. It's very pleasant to be here up high to catch a bird's eye view of Singapore. You wouldn't think the bustling Orchard Road is right below you. The food is good, although nothing seemed to stand out in particular. For this standard of restaurant, the staff might need to be better informed about wines, though, to provide a more thorough recommendation.But then, that ambiance..
5
Were celebrating friends birthday with group of 12.Awesome 360o view of the city amazed us from the first minute.The food was great, especially steaks and was served quickly and on time. I loved their appetizers as well. The staff was pleasant and very helpful.The prices are on very high side but it is worth of it. Highly recommend for luxury dinners
5
Great view and food! Excellent service too! One of the best resturant I have ever visited, will sure visit again.
2
My feeling it was abit over priced, have had better. Felt a better selection of main courses and vegetables. The view was good
4
You could go for the view alone but you would be missing out. The menu is filled with tasty treats and the presentation and flavors will have you coming back for more. The staff is brilliant and leave you to your own devices to enjoy the surroundings and your food. The wine list is exceptional an dwell priced. do yourself a favor whether its for a romantic dinner or client lunch, give Salt a try. We will be back
5
With a dedicated reception, lobby and an art gallery en route to the lift, it provided a good build up to the atmosphere.We ordered the Scotch and Wagyu Rump for our mains, didn't regret it! Contrary to what I have read in some reviews, the food was surprisingly good, albeit a bit pricey. But for such an exclusive ambience and excellent location, what more can I ask for? Perfect for a romantic date
5
It was my third visit and the food was still fantastic and this time, I brought along my son who's 2 and the staff were very attentive as usual and made efforts to bring my son colouring paper and crayons! I was also pleasantly surprised when they brought out the dessert and had "Happy Anniversary" on it. And they also helped us take a photo and printed it out and put it into a folder for us to being home. Very sweet gesture.
5
Dinner at salt Grill was very pleasing from many aspects. The ambience is impressive, the service from the greeting downstairs to the entrance on the 55th floor and then to your table was very good. The tables are set that literally you all have a window seat and the view at night is spectacular. Facing towards Sentosa and the water at night means just a seas of beautiful lights.. The atmosphere can be as formal or casual as you make it and is a great location for romantic dinners or to impress offshore visitors is great. the fact that it is all enclosed as well means that weather not an issue and also many guests prefer to dine without the humidity many rooftops tend to provideFood wise was excellent but you realise before even entering this is a $$$$ evening _ so get over that from the start. Menu is compact being a one pager but in essence offers a lot.. Ours included had the grilled octypus starter and assorted types of steaks for the main and the meat was perfect. Wine wise a decent list but we stayed by the glass and everyone was very nice pinot gris initially and a Victorian pinot noir matched the meal very well - on the sommelier suggestion.Overall, location impressive, staff very pleasant & attentive with the food & wine topping off a tremendous nightHighly recommended for those who prefer to fine-dine in air-con comfor
5
This was a surprise birthday dinner and it was indeed a big surprise, not only for the wonderful location but also for the excellent service and awesome food.Not sure whether the menu has been changed as it never appealed before but this was just superb. We were offered bread with olive oil and some different kinds of chips and fresh cut radish with a dip.I would really highly recommend the wagyu rump, so juicy and tender.The raspberry souffle with ice-cream is a great balance when eaten together, so light and fluffy yet well complemented by the ice-cream.Would love to return for the missed foie gras... So hopefully till next time..
5
this was the venue for a lunch with someone I hadn't met in a very long time and it was an excellent choice. The service was excellent, the food was excellent..... beautifully presented and delicious. The view from the 56th floor was slightly marred by the rain but did not detract from the memorable experience A must visi
4
Part of a chain by chef Luke mangan, this restaurant is on the 56th floor of the building above orchard Ion mallThey renovated 1 year ago and now have a crowded zig zag arrangement of tables by the window, I suppose to satisfy the demandThere's set and a la carte options for lunch. The set is affordable at $49 for 3 courses , which we chose. Most of the regular items prior to renovation have changed. Luckily the crab omelette entree is still there which I had. My main of pork was surprisingly good. My partner had kingfish sashimi and snapper which were good too. The chocolate dessert was decadent and not badAll in all a good lunch
4
Lovely panaromic views of the Indonesian islands on a clear day. Gives you a view of Singapore that you otherwise might probably never realised existed. Enjoyable afternoon tea with a girlfriend. Lovely, private, thoughtful service by the waiters with dedicated baskets to place your bags. Enjoyed the afternoon tea very much. Would love to come again.
5
A great way to celebrate any occasion in a romantic ambience. Nothing much to comment, everything is simply great.
4
Nice and quiet place for dinner with nice view. Service are excellent. Foods are good but expensive.
5
Yes its expensive. However it was a very nice experience. The bread they serve with the olive oil and seasoning was delicious.To start we had seared foie gras. It was heaven ...started sweet and then just left a slight savoury taste.For the main we had duck breast and confit duck in cherries. I could not fault it except to say that the further into the meal the more tender the duck became so maybe some resting needed here.Wine we had sauvingon blanc Churton from my favourite Marlborough Estate New Zealand.Overall a fantastic experience for us and would recommend to anyone with a fat wallet

I should compliment the staff for being so friendly, helpful, ready yet not too overwhelming or overly care! Food is super tasty and with good quality. The sommelier is always ready to help suggest us with the best wine for the pairing, making the dining experience there even better. The view? It is to die for! We were lucky today as we experienced sunny, rainy and thunderstorm in one sitting and it was indeed a super awesome experience. They have a platform for you to go around, enjoy the view, take photos as much as you want. The staff cannot be more helpful, most of them were actually good with taking photograph! Recommended!

Special occasions call for special settings: We chose this place for a special birthday celebration (at 55 floors right above Ion Orchard). The service crew were friendly and professional, and much more attentive to diners compared to the usual service at other places. I think attentiveness is a virtue as we paid equal attention to our food and the people around us. Their improvement could be having more initiative when arranging special requests as we have to make a trip specifically for it. On the whole, a very wonderful experience. No doubt it is very expensive, but for a special occasion, the price is special as well..

Came here for dinner a couple of time but didn't remember service was so good until we came here for lunch.Compare to other celebrity chefs' restaurant's set lunch, Salt Grill & Sky Bar set lunch seems much better value for money, let alone the amazing view of Singapore.$49 ++ for 3 course meal (incl coffee tea and complimentary snacks).Service was absolutely amazing. They took down our name before escorting us to the direct lift to 56th floor. Once the lift door opened we were greeted by friendly staffs who address us by surname. Food was amazing with a twist of Aussie's creativity. Interesting menu with taste to beat. Sommelier was very helpful and professional. Wine by the glass was a bit off he changed a new bottle for us with no question asked.And on top of everything, lunch time is less crowded, that clear day we can see magnificent view of Singapore Skyline and overlooking indonesia.We felt like every details has been taken care of while we were dining there. Service was worth-mentioning and it was a perfect lunch in Singapore. So, if you are lucky enough to get a long lunch break or have a weekday off, should totally try the lunch here

We took my parents to the New Year's Eve set dinner and they loved it.The food was exquisitely prepared, and although we booked the early slot (6 to 8pm) the waiters didn't rush us to turn the tables over.Obviously It's not cheap but you are paying for the view, and it's a perfect spot for a birthday or anniversary dinner.The wine list is not extensive and brace yourself when you see the prices
2
Went there with my husband and a few friends for dinner. Food is fairly good but way overpriced for what it is. You can find much better options in Singapore for half the price. I will not be returning to this restaurant or recommending it to anyone

As it was my 25th holiday in Singapore, I had tried most places, so was keen to experience the Australian chef Luke Mangan's restaurant on the 55th floor of the Ion Orchard building. I certainly wasn't disappointed and my Rare Spicy Venison, was probably the most tender steak I've had in my life! The Baby Vegetables were beautifully presented and the side of Sweet Potato Fries complimented the meal well. Service was excellent and we enjoyed the spectacular view over Singapore while enjoying pre dinner drinks and watched the sun set behind Sentosa Island. Not a cheap night out, but certainly a comfortable and very memorable one
3
We visited the restaurant over the New Year's weekend to celebrate my wife's bday. The receptionist was very kind to entertain our late request to postpone our appointment and accommodated our request for a table with a view. We waited for almost an hour at the bar but it was no fault of the service staffs as the window seats were very limited. Although the staffs were efficient, attentive and knowledgeable, we did not find the service to be particularly warm. I indicated that the dinner booking was for a birthday celebration, but yet there was not even a mention of well-wishes from the restaurant. To be honest, even though I might sound cheapskate, I did expected something (even a wish of Happy Birthday to my wife would make me happy). Perhaps we were spoiled by our previous experiences at other high-end restaurants which usually will provide some small birthday surprise in the form of complimentary desserts, discount or simply a note of well-wishes. Food-wise, it was good but not fantastic, considering the price we paid, we expected more. We ordered a Sirloin Steak, and the Market Fish (Salmon) for the mains, accompanied by the Australian mixed leaf salad and the Roast garlic mushrooms for the sides. For dessert, we ordered the Chocolate Molten Cake with Honeycomb Ice-cream.Everything was good but really nothing to shout about.The city view from the restaurant is good but not particular stunning compared the ones at Marina Bay precinct. Overall, we felt a little letdown by the experience. Perhaps it was because we went with a high expectation due to the reviews we read and the higher than average prices they charge. There wasn't anything particularly worth to compliment nor complain about, but we certainly don't see ourselves returning any time soon
5
Great combination of flavours and textures. Unfortunately my gnocchi had a piece of metal in it, but service was top notch, and the view and food were enough to make me forget about it.
5
This is my third visit, food is great, view is fantastic. Good for both family dinner and romantic date.
3
Food is average, nothing extraordinary. Good selection of wine. Excellent ambience and view of the city. Very pricy. Service was okay.
3
Very good experience, nice view and good service, but 75$ for the small but perfect main course is a bit too much, 100$ only main and one drink.... Better places around the world

My friend and I stumbled upon this restaurant bar while visiting ION Sky so we decided try out this restaurant thinking that it will be awesome after viewing the city skyline from atop. Indeed, the view and setting of the restaurant is great. Food wise we felt that they were not up to expectations given the price we paid. The steak I had was a tad too salty with the butter even though I didn't spread it much. Service was alright: staff were friendly but doesn't seem to explain the dishes much.
5
Was there for lunch. Being at the 55th floor of Ion Orchard, the view was amazing. Western food there was delicious. Took the set lunch and ordered truffle mash potatoes. It's pricey, around SGD80 per person and we didn't order any alcoholic drinks. But definitely worth a visit
5
The steak took 30 min to arrive which was expected as they did it to perfection! We were served bread and salad while waiting. The side dishes were also excellent and the dessert was delightful! This is my second visit to the restaurant and will definitely be back in the near future

Some foodie friends have always wanted to try Salt. Perhaps their enthusiasm caused me to come with heighten expectations. But after struggling and finally getting a reservation we pitched up at 8.45pm ready for a great evening. It was an OK evening but at nearly $900 for the three of us, it is difficult to argue that it was value for money. The view was nice, but no better than at many other Singapore eateries such as either of the two establishments at the Tower Club. The food averaged from slightly below par to good. Because I had just returned from Sydney where I dined at the Chophouse, I did not fancy another steak. So I had the Comfit wrapped in pastry with mustard fruit and apple mayo followed by a Ricotta & sweet potato gnocchi with shaved truffles and 80% chocolate molten cake with honey comb ice cream. I always enjoy duck and recently I had a wonderful mustard apple mayo at Pollen. The duck was moist but lacked any crisp edges but the pastry was light enough. The disappointment was that the mustard fruit and apple mayo neither contrasted nor particularly complimented the dish. The gnocchi was particularly unmemorable and shaved truffles, well my taste buds must have failed, as I could taste none. The molten chocolate cake was very nice but honeycomb ice cream? Well I could neither tell what type of honey nor were there any interesting bits that I normally associate with this type of ice cream. But the salted coffee soil was a most interesting add-on, though it was not to the taste of one of my friends (but then she hates salted chocolate, caramels etc.).My friends and I had nibbles of each other’s dishes. On the foie gras and scallop -the foie gras was well done in that the chef sourced a quality piece and then resisted doing too much with it. The end result a wonderful incredibly decadent melt-in-your mouth feel. The scallop should have contrasted with its clean moist ocean favour – that is if you could have found it. In this dish, the scallop appeared to be present in print only. The other mouthful I had was real disappointing and that was my other friend’s Kilpatrick. Whilst I understand the rustic nature of this dish (the biker origins and all that) oysters are damn difficult to get right and they did not get it right. Both my friends had the wagyu cut which I assume came from Queensland. Given that one of my homes is in Tasmania, and given thus my preference for Cape Grimm, or those from Greenham or the Hammond family or several others, I must confess I was not terribly disposed to the dish. My mouthful was nice enough but compared less well that the one I had a few days earlier at the Chophouse. For dessert one friend had affogato and vanilla ice cream and the other Sorbet crumbs and berries. The affogato arrived at least 10 minutes before the other desserts (and he was just finishing it off as hers and mine arrived). I hate to say this but I cannot even remember the flavor of the sorbet.My friends had arrived early and had cocktails. So we skipped my normal fizzy and went straight for the good stuff. I had asked for a barolo but was recommended a barbaresco instead. Nice enough but for the price, an uninspiring recommendation. The service was warm but lacked the ‘edge’ one would expect except at the level of the maitre d’ (he was good). For instance, I had sparkling water and my friends drink only still water. She managed to fill his still water with my sparkling. The affogato arrived 10 minutes ahead of our desserts etc.I do not think I will not be going back
5
I hadn't booked the Salt Grill, and was planning just to go up for the view, but instead went for dinner and watched the city turn to night over a fabulous dinner. The staff are very professional and attentive, without being over the top. The meals were served in a timely fashion and very tasty. They also gave me an appetiser whilst I waited for my main course, which was nice.The price is a little high, but then the view makes it worth the extra cost
4
This is the place to go for a good meal and spectacular view. The food was very good but also very expensive. We didn't know the wines on the menu and was helped by the staff to select a good wine. They recommended a very nice wine that was actually one of the cheapest wines on the list. Excellent service.For gentlemen, go into the washroom the view from here is one to be experienced Too bad the ladies washroom doesn't have this. Overall very good meal, great view but expensive
5
we loved this restaurant, great food and amazing views, fantastic service, thank you! the whole evening was amazing, though it would be nice to have a dedicated taxi stand for the patrons
4
Fantastic Service, the food is great. The view a must, include we can see the light spectacle from the Marina Bay Hotel. Try it.
3
A restaurant with great service and nice view. Food is a lil pricey. Wished I had a table by the window. But I booked pretty last minute so no chance.
5
This place is 55 floors up. Incredible view looking South towards the South China Sea. My starter was salmon tartar with roast chicken skin - this ingredient is see through with almost no body but a rich roast chicken flavour....most deliciously unusual.We followed this with steak - mine blue and the wife's medium - both cooked perfectly. Potato puree and other sides complimented the protein. The steak came with a few veg - get them on the side (as I did) as the meat was a work of art and should be on the plate alone! Grain fed Australian beef - deep purple in colour. Wonderful.We had some Mumm blanc de blanc to open the meal followed by a smooth Penfold's shiraz concluding with a smokey Japanese whisky.....The service was the best we've seen in Singapore - SE Asia is not a place to go for good service but the service at Salt was impeccable and equal to the best in say London...Everything fell into place with this meal - it is one of the best we've ever had.One complaint was the thoughtless parents in a neighbouring table with a very loud brat. Fortunately it was quite late and they left pretty soon. You really need to learn how to keep it under control!And a note to the staff at Ion - when customers leave late at night after the escalators have been turned off be aware they will not know their way through the maze of underground tunnels to get out so being patronising and dismissive about directions when they ask for guidance makes you look rather silly
5
Visited this restaurant on a Sunday evening and specifically booked a table next to the window. not essential that you have a window table to appreciate the views as the windows are huge and every table has a wonderful view over Singapore. Good choice of different cuts of steak on this menu, starters were delicious, well presented and of a decent size. Main course for me was a fillet steak, cooked perfectly. fantastic selection of wine here too. very knowledgeable sommelier who was very friendly and generous with his time. Very good experience all round, would visit again
5
We were taken here to celebrate our engagement and what a great place to do it...56 floors up, overlooking Singapore with phenomenal steaks and wines. The fare throughout was fantastic, all using top quality ingredients and cooked to perfection. However, what really topped it off for me was Fazil, the sommelier, and his game of 'surprise me' played with the wines! Always enjoy a sommelier who makes wine approachable and fun for all. Capped off an amazing night and foodie experience.*** Tip - To take your night to the next level, ask the sommelier to play

We made our way to this place on a Sunday morning for trying new place to have brunch. We called to make reservation just half an hour before arrive and the rest was just great experience. At the highest level of the building, this is an iconic place. From the 232m height, you will see a nice bird eye view of Singapore city, mostly the Central area, the place where we live. The food was great. The best tasting food of the day had to be from the market fish menu, Salmon and Mussel, Leek, Crustacean and Potato. The appetizer was really good. We had the Chicken Liver Foei Gras Parfait and Pear Shallot Chutney to start the brunch. We simply loved our brunch time here. This is a good place to bring friends and families for enjoying the good view and great food
4
Spent our 2nd wedding anniversary here. Beautiful view, prompt service & gd ambience. Unfortunately, front desk was disorganised and cld be improved. They called me the day b4 to confirm our reservations, mixed up my first and last name. Cldnt find records on the special msg i requested on our dessert and asked to repeat it to them. I said I wld check the email correspondence i had w the resturant earlier on and call back. When i did call back, the lady on the line said she did indeed have the special msg in the system. So curious why the previous caller cldnt find the msg. Subsequently, the msg that appeared on our dessert was still incomplete. Not sure if it was because the msg i requested for was too long. But they cld ve told me before hand. The second incident was when they called to ask if we were on our way to the restaurant when we were already seated in the restaurant for 15mins. Glass crab omelette was yummy but our main courses (barrumandi and wagyu which were specials of the day) were mediocre. Great place to chill but not sure abt the food

A girl friend gave us a birthday treat to Salt Grill last Friday. We had to take a special elevator up from the Ion Art gallery to the restaurant. The view was nice, sky was clear that evening, although where we were sitting we were looking at mainly in the direction of the apartments.For the dishes, the three of us decided to share 3 appetisers, 2 mains and 2 desserts. The waitress recommended us to take the specials for the day which is the burrata salad. She also advised that the crab omelette broth and grilled scallops were good, so we took that as well. Mains were the 200g grass fed beef fillet done medium and pan fried snapper. For desserts, we went for the souffle and lime liquorice bomb. Her recommendations turned out pretty good. We loved the lightness of the burrata salad which had more greens that cheese and the omelette was warm, tasty and soupy. Fillet was a bit heavy going, but the snapper was just right, with crispy skin. Dessert was a bit less impressive, shuffle seems to be a bit uncooked? It was wet and half of it was creamy inside although the top was nice and fluffy. The lime bomb helped to diffuse the heavy meal that we just had.Service was good too although a bit curt, could've been due to the crowd - it was a busy night. Nevertheless, the waiters and waitresses did oblige and help to take some birthday photos for us.Overall, it was a great experience and we had a wonderful time at the restaurant with the nice food and view

Decided to try on this restaurant for the restaurant week. Food is delicious... fresh prawn, fresh fish, succulent beef and yummy ice cream. But what set it apart is the service... excellent service throughout. We change the reservations timing 2x, no slightest annoyance detected on the voice; we were running late and they called us and hold the table for us. Great service throughout the meal and all the course comes just at the right time (not rushing, but not too much delay). Best restaurant venue to see Singapore from the high altitude
4
I recently visited the salt grill for dinner with a friend. The food and service was wonderful with great steaks. The view makes the night complete and the atmosphere is first rate
4
If there was not the "lobby" experience I would give it a full 5 star! Excellent food and drinks in a roof top beautiful environment!
Love the atmosphere in this restaurant and its diverse menu.Staff very friendly and smiling faces all around!
5
Great food, great atmosphere, outstanding service. The best anniversary dinner. The view from the restaurant was outstanding.
5
In Singapore on business and was taken to this restaurant for dinner. The food was amazing, and my colleague is a wine connoisseur. The sommelier came out and provided great recommendations. Unfortunately the haze was closing our view but fun all the same
5
Stunning views and luscious food to whet your appetite in a nutshell. One of the best restaurant that i went for ages, Salt Grill and Sky Bar is simply amazing and to die for and a 5-diamond/star hotel-like service treatment. Perched on the roof of the Ion Orchard Shopping Mall at the 55th floor, it commands an amazing bird's eye view of stunning Singapore, from the glitzy neon of Orchard road malls, to the glittering Marina Bay Sands Hotel and its laser light show, you can see everything without obstruction and be amazed at how small Singapore is land-wise. Food is a gastronomic delight as well. From the punch of thai spices in the poached prawns for appetizer, to the marriage of sweet and savory flavours of the Pan Fried fish with bacon and caulifower puree as the main dish, me and my friends were constantly delighted. I have to say, hats off to the service staff as well, from the concierge desk to the wait staff, they were impeccable in service, attentive and polite. It is also one of the very few restaurants i know in Singapore that the service staff will asks guests if they are allergic to anything and that is the hallmark of a 5-diamond service training. We had the restaurant week Singapore fixed price menu but if its 3-course meal is this amazing for restaurant week, i am certain it is even more stunning when you book it for more romantic or business getaways. Overall, the view is amazing and the food delicious but above all, I prize the service staff and the 5-star treatment that you get from them. Bravo!Note: To get to Salt Grill and Sky Bar at the 55th floor, First you have to get to the 4th floor of Ion Orchard Shopping Mall by lifts or escalator and find the concierge desk. At the concierge desk sits the lovely Salt Grill & Sky Bar concierge receptionist dedicated to the restaurant. The concierge will personally walk you to the elevator that is a non-stop lift that takes you directly to the restaurant on the 55th floor

Whilst stopping on Sentosa Island, Singapore - it was my husbands birthday. We were treated to a meal by some friends at Salt grill and Sky Bar. The experience of dining 50 + floors up, in a thunderstorm, sitting beside a plate glass window was unparalleled!! The staff were courteous and attentive. The food (I had steak) was absolutely divine. So tender and melted in my mouth. The best I've ever had! The side dishes were tasty and plentiful. The food and views were to die for. Highly recommended although quite expensive.
2
I last visited here for restaurant week two years ago and I remember the dishes being more enjoyable with more thought going into each dish. The dishes this time around, including the pork entree, the beef brisket and the chocolate desert were very disappointing. Even though the price paid was a bargain restaurant week amount, I felt like I over paid. I visited gunthers and adrift earlier in the week and the food was much more enjoyable there. The only saving grace this trip was the service, which was very very good
5
Gals service staff excellent.Local guy a bit unpolishedFurther improvement when checking food served to customer...use of English..................eg. IS IT OK ??Preferably use How is the food served ? Is everything alright ?...more refinedOverall a Great Dining experience. Will be backUse of OK for a $400 > bill & above a bit too casual................
4
Nice spot off Orchard. For Singapore standards I was impressed with the service which in Singapore is generally pathetic. The food choices on the set menu were great and portion good. I like the way the food was displayed, the fusion of taste and the freshness. Well done. And the views make it a great setting. ..am sure woud be better at night night. Loved the fish. 
5
This is a restaurant on the 55th level on ION Shopping Mall. The food is terrific, having a Two to Share Barramundi and Crab Omelet. A little expensive if not for a special occasion.We went there for a very special occasion. On a clear sky, the view would be awesome. However, the haze did not do justice as visibility of many tall buildings disappear over a period
4
Good place to have a business lunch without being overheard in a nice ambiance with great view. Portions aren't very large which is suitable for lunch.
4
The restaurant is worth visiting if u have a sponsor. ...nice view.....Australian restaurant. ..food portion is not that gr8...but it's appealing.u get new taste
5
First visit to Salt grill & Sky bar for their brunch. The brunch was good with reasonable price. Will go back and try out the high tea!
4
My wife and I truly enjoyed my 1st wedding anniversary dinner at Salt Grill and sky bar. It was an alluring culinary experience! Food was appealing to the tastebuds coupled with a classy atmosphere and excellent service by the staff. Thank u once again!
5
We enjoyed a great time at the Salt Grill & Bar, which was the 4th Luke Mangan Restaurant we visited after the Glass Restaurant in Sydney, Salt in Tokyo and the Salt Tapas Bar in Singapore. Again, totally different than it's predecessors, this grill offers a great view of Singapore (on the day of our visited sadly slightly obscured by the haze), and a nicely balanced lunch menu. Even for our 2.5 y.o. daughter, there was a menu of Spaghetti and dessert from ice cream to chocolate cake! WQould recommend and would love to go again
2
We were looking for good food for two adults and a three year old and on asking at the main entry (before heading up to the sky) we were assured it would be suitable..... We were wrongly advised. The food was ok but not anything too special if I'm honest and considering we only had mains and a coup,e of glasses of wine, coupled with the fact the waiting staff seemed to be ignoring us, it was certainly not worth the $396!!!!Maybe for couples, most certainly not for family's with young children
5
Celebrated my partner's birthday at the Salt grill and Salt bar and we were delightfully greeted with friendly staff who catered to our every need. As we came from Sentosa, we were dressed in a rather mismatched manner - backpacks + smart casual clothes and were initially afraid of customer differentiation by the staff but none of that happened! :) Our entrees took awhile to be served but we were offered a delicious salad on the house, courtesy of one of the staff! This was something we never expected to have and it really warmed us. We also got a window seat with an amazing view of the Singapore landscape. Food served was great and I highly recommend dinner here
4
Yes off course its a great view of Singapore from the restaurant! Located at level 55 at Ion orchard.Apart from the great view , food served is not so great. 3 Person lunch costed around 969 Sgd. Based on the price we pay , there was no great service. Waitress (not able to speak English ) confused with orders . A GREAT VIEW COMES WITH A GREAT PRICE TOO....A free great view of the same available on same level 55 from 3 pm to 6 pm too

I was unsuccessful in booking for a dinner table from the online reservation app in hungrygowhere. I indicated under the 'Special Notes for the Restaurant' that Salt Grill & Sky Bar was the first choice my wife considered to celebrate our 16th Wedding Anniversary that evening. It was with much delight that the restaurant called me to offer us a table. What a pleasant surprise to start the evening! It wasn't hard to find the prominent concierge on the 4th level in ION. We were ushered through a dark corridor that transitioned into a private lift lobby, next we were zapped to the 55th level where we were being greeted by name and ushered to our waiting table with a surprise waiting. It was a complimentary sherbet with a lighted candle with the words "Happy Anniversary!" How thoughtful! We shared a glass of Cointreau Fizz (alcoholic drink) which was concocted right before us and I love the Appetizer which is essentially Omelette in Crab meat with tasty mustard broth that heads the appetizer section. I had the 300gm Wagyu beef under Kobe selection which was the most succulent and tender beef i've had in a while. I suspect it has a marbling grade of 3 and above. My wife decided for the Market Fish (snapper) which was not too bad according to her. We finished off the evening with a pot of Camomile Tea and a hazy view of the surrounding buildings. It would be quite a view without the haze. In all it was an amazing dinning experience with well wishes from the staff and a beautiful wife for company. The bill came up to S$220

If you want to enjoy the skyline of Singapore, this is the place. If you want to enjoy a good wine and seafood or meat, again this is the place in Singapore. Their staffs are well trained and you can enjoy the lunch and dinner very comfortably.
3
This place have great views, good service and average food.
Can try or skip...
I cannot even remember what I have eaten the next day as the food did not leave an impression.
5
Wow! What a setting to have a drink looking over the incredible Singapore skyline. Drinks are quite expensive (not unusual in Singapore) but it's a place like no other and well worth it...
3
Went there for a Sunday dinner, 2pax. Setting is the main attraction, the view is beautiful, probably better for lunch than dinner. Lighting is very low, might be for the view but seriously you can't see what you are eating.'Carte' choices are just enough, but definitely should have more 'set menus'.Food was just OK. Service is present but clearly not trained professionals.Obviously, overpriced. But what do you expect.May go back for lunch or drinks
5
Hits: The view of course! I recommend coming in at 630pm and watch the city goes from dusk to night. The waitresses and waiters are very professional and well-trained with good knowledge. They are prompt with their service. The timing of the courses were timed perfectly and accordingly - amuse bouche, bread, appetizer, mains. And 1 plus point is that the portion is really big! I was surprised because fine dining portions were usually really small and a mouthful.Misses: I love all the dishes I ordered, scallops and salmon caviar for appetizer. Salmon for main. However, the main course, duck breast, was too hard to chew. And the truffle parmesan fries didn't fare well in the 'truffle' taste. The tables were spaced quite closely together. I could overheard the entire conversation of the table behind me during my dining experience.Recommendation: Do reserve a window table for the best view
5
This is a really nice restaurant for some fine food, without really needing to follow the fine dining etiquette (smart casual attire is still a must though). The price is what you will expect from it, hence, I really wouldn't splurge on it had it not be my wife's birthday.We had a three course meal. There's nothing to complain for the starter (Foie gras with some scallops) and main (pork belly with lobster). The food is cooked almost perfect, and I can't give an unbiased review because they are really good. You have to try it out yourself. I saw plenty other diners ordering fresh oysters, I believe they must be fresh and good too. The dessert came prepared with a Happy Birthday greetings for my wife on the plate. This is the small gesture from them after I have remarked that this meal is for my wife's birthday during reservation. Some tip: Request for seats on the top floor, which allows panoramic view to the Marina Bay Area. The lower floor only offers view of the residences surrounding Ion. Also, remember that the restaurant can only be accessed via Ion level 4 concierge.
5
My husband brought me here for my birthday celebration and it was really very great. The restaurant has a very good view around Orchard Road and has very nice ambience. Food were very good and staff were very attentive as well. Look forward to be back again

My husband and I went there with another couple to celebrate their engagement. Our friend had bought a package from the restaurant which included tickets to S.E.A. Aquarium at Sentosa. There is a private futuristic-like lift that brings us up to the 55th floor of ION Orchard.We really loved the food served as well as the service provided by the waiters. The restaurant overlooks the Spore skyline but not the one facing MBS.We had a full 3 course meal starting with cocktail, complimentary bread and soup, baked oysters and foie gras for appetizer. The foie gras was cooked to perfection. For the main course, I had the duck breast cooked at medium rare, the meat was tender and succulent. My husband had the lamb with sweet potatoes and we have to say that the sweet potatoes was absolutely A+++++! We finished off with a choc dessert cake and coffee. Great dining experience
5
We’re back at the Salt Grill & Sky Bar here in Singapore, one of my favorite restaurants for fine-dining. This time, we chose to have Afternoon Tea at the restaurant. The Afternoon Tea is priced at an affordable S$30++ per person (inclusive of a coffee or tea) OR S$40++ per person including a glass of G.H. Mumm Champange.This is truly a very attractive deal and possibly the cheapest Afternoon Tea in town - at such a fancy restaurant. A special shout-out goes to our AMAZING and OUTSTANDING server named Mally (she’s a Filipina). We actually had 2 servers serving us - 1 male Caucasian (who never smiles) and the sweet Mally. She helped brighten up our Afternoon Tea experience and we were truly honored to have her take care of our table.Afternoon Tea is available daily from 2.30pm to 5.30pm. Advanced reservation is encouraged if you wish to get a table by the window. - Personal Rating for Food: 4/5- Personal Rating for Service: 5/5 (Special shout-out to our waitress, Mally)- Personal Rating for Ambience: 5/5- Personal Rating for Value-For-Money: 5/5Highly recommended place for Afternoon Tea - especially if you are not a big eater ;-
5
Reserved a table for dinner on 12 Aug 15 to celebrate my wife's birthday. Took the elevator to the 55th floor and when I stepped out, I was warmly greeted by the receptionist by name. I had the steak tartar for appertiser which was excellent and the rack of lamb for the mains. The lamb was done to perfection, very juicy and tender. My wife had the salmon which she enjoyed. The service was excellent, very attentive and helpful. Special thanks to the Asst. Rest. Manager, Laroslav and Supervisor, Ms.Mally for making our dinner so much more enjoyable. Overall, we had a very nice and romantic dinner except for the table behind us. There were 9 men and 1 lady, all Caucasians, talking and laughing very loudly which spoilt the ambience. This is a fine dining restaurant so be prepared to pay a higher price. We paid more than S$400 for the evening with a bottle of wine. Yes, we will come back again when we celebrate our special moments
5
Was here for business lunch. The price is on the high side, but they have lunch set menus which is more reasonable at $49 for 2 course and $63 for 3 course (if I remember correctly). You can check it out on their website.The view is great, at level 55 of Ion. The service is impeccable and the food was really good. At night, it is a totally different experience, with dim, romantic lighting. Equally nice
3
Service and ambience was fantastic. Food was relatively good but one would expect them to be superb given the prices.

Food is great. Presentations are simple yet beautiful. Very nice ambiance. Very easy to reach in the middle of Orchard road. Love it.
3
Was quite disappointed with the quality of the cocktails. Food was so so. Nothing to rave about. Expensive.
4
Lovely team. Was nicely greeted and welcome. Loved the ambiance. The view is just fantastic. Small portion of food. Overly charged. Good food but I personally feel they abuse on the blue cheese. Really expensive but you need to visit it for at least once. Recommend to go at night. The view is amazing. Not going back

I came here with a friend one evening for drinks and a light bite to eat. We were seated quickly and our drinks and food order taken. Drinks arrived relatively quickly but not super fast. After 40 minutes we enquired about the food and the waitress looked confused and then she realised she had not made the order. Disappointing really and no reduction in bill was offered.The view is breathtaking and this is the real reason to visit.Overall, would return but they need better staff!
5
We came back it was so good last time we were in Singapore. I must say I was not disappointed at all, it was spectacular from the view the cocktails and then the gorgeous food. We had calamari a and the beef cheek to start with a cosmopolitan cocktail and a Long Island iced tea. We then followed it with the barramundi main and a rocket, pear blue cheese and walnut salad. All enjoyed with a sav blac , best lunch with a gorgeous husband and and a wonderful view. The staff were very attentive and very knowledgeable . We will always come back when ever we are in Singapore. Great job
5
I visited the restaurant on 26 July 2015 and it was a fantastic experience. The service staff were attentive and the food was superb. The view offered was breath-taking as well.What touched me was the fact that my wife and I received a complimentary personalised dessert as we were celebrating our wedding anniversary.Overall a wonderful experience like no other
5
The restaurant of course has a very great view,staff are very helpful and take care of customer.One of the waitress noted that my girlfriend and me have peanut allergy,so when we finish the main dish and would like to order a dessert,she still remember and recommend us to order other dessert which is peanut free dessert. And due to last minute reservation,the restaurant is unable to prepare the pre-order birthday cake,but they help to write a personalize message on the dessert plate.The champagne and white wine taste is not nice,but the foods are delicious,total spend $286,worth it for the foods but not for the wine and champagne,will come back again

The experience was great in general! The food provided was tasty and value for money in terms of the food quality! They were sweet to serve a special birthday ice cream even though I rejected their WOW package which costs 98SGD for two pax. I was aware of the price range of the food there but was quite shocked by the slightest thing - water. The waitress came to ask me if I wanted still or sparkling water. I ordered for still water and she came with a Panna bottle. I thought the bottle was a communal bottle for all tables which ordered for still water. In the end, when I asked for the bill, I saw in the receipt "Panna x 1 = $13.00". It was then that I realised that they had opened up a bottle of Panna just for my table. I thought they should have told us about this in prior but they didn't. Since it was my birthday, I didn't want to make a fuss out of it and left.But overall, it was great! Worth my second visit but I will definitely finish up the whole bottle of Panna before I leave!

I made a reservation a month ago to celebrate my 10th year wedding anniversary with my hubby at Salt Grill. We actually celebrated his birthday a few years ago at Salt and was bowled over by the exemplary service by the wait staff and the sublime food; thus we wanted to go back to Salt again for this celebration.Upon making my reservation, i did request for a window sitting as i mentioned that its for our wedding anniversary. Upon reaching the restaurant, the reception staff very unsmilingly brought us to our table, then proceed to put my bag in a basket by my husband's side of the table. As i stood later to retrieve something from my bag, the same receptionist said a loud 'excuse me' behind me so that she can seat the other customer whose chair is where my bad was put. I think that was rather rude of her to not even wait for me to take my stuff out of the bag. A while later, the unsmiling sommelier came to take our wine order, then another unsmiling waitress came to take our food order. Granted that they were all polite, but what's with all that grouchy unsmiling faces? Salt's staff wasn't like that a few years ago when i visited; they were all so polite and friendly, today's staff were a far cry from the standard before.The food is still as good, the view, excellent. After the plates were cleared, there was no note taken of the fact that we were there to celebrate our 10th year anniversary. Even as we paid and left, we walked past the kitchen to go to the lift, where the wait staff and sommelier were standing around with not a single one to say bye to us. Just stood there and gave my husband and I this blank stare.Honestly, with this kind of service, i don't think i will be back ever again. I might rather pay for a view at Equinox but at least i feel welcome and happy with the service or i can go eat at a simple restaurant at Thai Express or any cafe and i get much better service than Salt- without having to pay a high price for it

Recently took a friend out to lunch at Salt. Excellent staff, great lunch menu, and reasonable prices.
Great for business lunches: you'll surely impress with a table next to the window.
2
Overall standard of service and food has dropped quite significantly. The appetiser and dessert were ok but the main dish was rather disappointing.
2
. Not good value for average food. Expected better tasting food served at proper temperature. Glass crab noodle omelet was not hot and not very tasty. Red snapper with thai salad was average. Overall experience was okay but disappointing for the price.
4
Went to chill out with my friend after dinner on a weekday evening. We had some mocktails and appetisers. Lovely quiet ambience to chat and admire the city view. Service was pretty alright.
4
Celebrated my birthday here. Unique, tasty cocktails and food dishes, amazing view. I guess the reason the place wasn't packed on a Friday night might be the prices...
5
Went to the restaurant on a rainy day and it was cold. Took their set lunch and it was great. Tried their salad but service wasn't that prompt. Had to call the waiter couple of time before our requests were made.
3
Fantastic views (especially from the bathrooms!). Expected more from the menu .....pork tapas was drowning in sauce, beef under-cooked, spicy barramundi not remotely spicy! Wine menu good at usual Sing prices. The service was a MAJOR let-down. Waitress tried hard but simply not enough staff. Wine waiters put on a nice show never to reappear. Cleared plates while other diners still eating. Maybe a drink in the bar to enjoy the view but overall a big disappointment
5
Was just walking by when I came across the Salt Grill and Sky bar. Not a native to Singapore,,, it for me at the time was quite a find. I was craving non-spicy food and more continental. I was able to get a small meal that hit the spot. Lovely foie gras pate with brioche and a walnut and blue cheese salad! Wonderful view and lovely food,,,, on the 55th floor. Staff were welcoming even thought I got the a slight feeling they would have preferred "not to have me then" as they were in the midst of stetting up for their evening service. Pricey but a lovely change from what on offer every where in Singapore.
5
Wife brought me here to celebrate my birthday.Service: 4/5Literally be "on time", the ION concierge does not allow you to go up if you arrive early. Service staff in the restaurant is friendly and prompt.Food: 4.5/5Absolutely WonderfulViews: 5/5Request for a window seat and be "wowed"Overall:Perfect for celebrations or busines

We held a Mount Langi Ghiran wine dinner here last night with 20 guests. We served the 2004, 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2013 Langi Shiraz all matched with food from Salt. The duck dish matched with the 2011 was the stand out for me, but all the food was excellent and great with the wine. Service was smooth and elegant. The view spectacular.
5
Come for great view and a beautiful view of the singapore landscape. Lunch and high tea are great options, good food, location and wonderful drinks. Tourists come up for pictures and even corporates come up for work lunches.
4
Excellent customer service, picturesque view, food that's cooked to perfection, and wonderful drinks!
5
Two of us went for an early lunch.
I requested a window seat which was fulfilled and the view is amazing.
Service was extremely attentive, and top quality food.
Will definitely visit again.
5
This is a go-to fixture for power lunches and dinners. Top class service and great food. My rib-eye steak came with wonderful marbling and flavor, and was cooked to perfection. Make sure to get a table by the windows so that you have unobstructed views from high in the sky - simply fantasti

If you have one night in Singapore set aside for that expensive meal, then this is the place to go. The food is simply outstanding.Service is attentive, friendly, without being servile or sterile.The view from the 55th floor is great - not over the harbour, but nonetheless it adds ambience to a fine dining occasion.Can recommend the "mystery wine" choice. In typical fashion, the cost of a bottle is prohibitive, but a pre meal drink and a glass of wine with your meal will be acceptable to most (cost wise).Food is simply in our top two list thus far, and we have eaten fine dining is a number of places - Europe and USA.Cost is not for the feint-hearted. A couple who have two courses with a couple of drinks, and coffee afterwards, should expect to pay at least $300. Since you can't shop in Singapore (due to prices), suggest spending some money on a visit to this restaurant. In summary: I would happily go there again

For all the hoopla about this restaurant, proved to be a non-event. Once again, Singapore restaurants just don't cut it. must be a reason why genuine top 100 ratings keep missing Singapore. Maybe the reason is that food is one of those areas where the left brain should not be the dominant force. Singapore works well with left brain enterprises: logic, common sense, analytical, mathematical, business minded. etc Boring. The right brain has not had enough time to evolve and that is why the creative, imaginative, intuitive side is still hard to find.thats how it is in this restaurant? my son said 'baby's first fine dining experience'. Poor service: how bad: only 3 people at a table and they asked three times who ordered what for appetizer? No one is interested really. this is a churning restaurant, churn the customers, churn the bill, churn the experience, Mr Mangan better pay a visit because i dont think this is what he intended. Dirty glass windows into the kitchen make it look like a dining car on a Ugandan train. The forecourt area is a mess, and the whole place is full of line cooks all busy following 'the procedure'. Sweet steaks, wet and limp salads, AND get this: they dont know how to make fries. How on earth can you screw up something so simple: you just dunk the frozen fries into hot oil and dust with salt. Here is how: oil not hot enough so the fries are limp, oil rancid so the fries smell of bad oil and not salted properly. Need i go on? shape up Salt grill, the only nice part was the view. And the wine, but that was bottled in France so it does not count

Normaly when the location is WOW the food is not according,but this restaurant is an exception.The location is a little difficult to find,(on the upper floor of the ION mall)but when you step out of the elevator you know that this is the special place you look for.Very tasteful food and great precentacion.The views make the experience complete.One person menu with glass of wine and coffee 65 euros.greetings

Perfectly located on the 55th Level of ION Orchard, this restaurant is what you need for a special night out. Beautiful ambiance with delicious range of food available. Staffs were very friendly and attended to our requests well. Food were promptly served with minimal waiting time. Definitely worth the amount you pa
5
Absolutely 5 star. Fantastic views, wonderful food and backed up by excellent service. Pan fried foie gras starter was right on the money, followed by rare fillet steak + truffle fries...amazing. Wine selection is superb. Even served a 2011 Barrossa McClaren Vale Chiraz by the glass. Unadulterated food porn...-
1
Some of the wait staff were so lacking in personality and attention that I was tempted to tap them to check that they were not encased in a beaker of formaldehyde. Please let them know it is ok to clear the plates before the next course arrives. I knew we were in for a big ticket night but all I kept thinking was "You cannot be serious!" What are you offering to match the prices you are charging? Nothing!!The food was ok but everything else was so disappointing you are left with a feeling you are being ripped off. Went with high expectations, left feeling completely underwhelmed
5
The restaurant truly lived up to the hype, serving up a steak and barramundi perfectly done! The wait staff were also well versed with the menu, offering recommendations based on our preferences.
5
Best view in Singapore and amazing food and drink in the restaurant and bar. Siitting on the terrace after our meal for a nightcap was a highlight. Highly recommended.
5
The hosts of our business trip took us here. They had never been to the restaurant their selves but it got highly recommend by some friends.Let me tell you... we were all very impressed, the view over Singapore is great and so is the food!I suggest you go there early so you can enjoy the view by day and night

I decided on this restaurant based on Tripadvisor reviews for my wife's birthday and included my mother and sister in laws all of whom are critical foodies. My wife is a Celiac and was very pleased to find that for a change the restaurant not only had food that she could have but that they had gluten free bread.We all enjoyed the food and the service was great, not cheap but good size portions. My only complaint was the french fries were a bit of a let down as they were skinny (I like large) and were not salted and as a result were soft when I got around to eating them, other than that a good meal.Now for the negative. To get to the restaurant you have to take a special elevator which is in a dark lobby, the elevator is black with very subdued lighting. This upset my elderly mother in law who felt very claustrophobic and frightened. I would also suggest that with the poor lighting it is an accident waiting to happen and possibly even a law suit. I hope the restaurant read this and do something about it
5
i brought my husband here for our anniversary and we had a really really good time. the service was so good - we had a hostess who talked us through everything and then a really good waitress who served us throughout. Ku De Ta needs to take a few tips from this place. The food; steaks we had were cooked to perfection and seasoned well. breads were warm and gorgeous. we had a beautiful desert which they dressed up to wish us happy anniversary. loved it
4
We arrived early and enjoyed cocktails in the bar - tick! We didn't sit down till about 8pm and so went straight to main courses, which were served promptly - tick!The steaks were excellent. I ordered the fillet, which was perfectly cooked and came with a delightful mushroom purée, oven baked sweet carrots and spinach - tick!The French fries were hot and salty - tick!Our friends ordered steak, lobster and pork - all received a tick!The sommelier was friendly and knowledgable - tick!Good service - polite and quick to fill glasses - tick!One of the party asked for their steak to be cooked a little more - no problem - tick!Gluten free bread available - big tick!Too full for desert.Overall, an excellent experience, impressive setting, good service, NOT cheap but you get what you pay for in Singapore - tick, tick, tick
4
We arrived early and had a drink at the bar. No waitstaff and the barman came from behind the bar to serve us. The drinks and the service were ordinary. No finesseThe food was mixed with 2 of our party having steak. They said it was OK without being fabulous. My wife enjoyed the duck while I had the pork belly with lobster which was disappointing as it was pretty flavourless.The wine list was extensive but astronomical prices. The waiters seemed to be there mainly to empty your wine bottle as quickly as possible in the hope you order another.It proves the old adage; " Don't eat at a restaurant with a view.
4
There are many places in Singapore to enjoy a lovely view, but few deliver on food and service as well. From the time we entered Salt until the time we left, we were treated to great service, delicious food and an extraordinary view of Singapore. The kingfish sashimi is fantastic and the steaks a highlight as well. Go for the view--stay for the food
4
Excellent meal, service and view. In comparison to Wolfgang Puck's Restaurant in Singapore (CUT), everything including the beef was far better. We enjoyed the heloumi and foie gras appetizers (both yummy) with a glass of MUMM Brut. Our mains included Wagyu cut sirloin and the filet mignon with a side of brocollini. Delicious. If anything, and ironically (given the restaurant name) the fillet could have used more salt. The atmosphere is very nice but not stuffy. Views are fantastic (we enjoyed a lightning storm). The website says casual elegance dress code but we noticed a couple of groups with men in shorts. After dinner, we went to the sky bar for a cognac tasting. Yummy. I highly recommend this restaurant for good food and service with a great view. We'll be back

Located on the 55th andn 56th floor of the Ion Mall on Orchard, locationally it could not get any better. views across Singapore is brilliant . Drinks prepared were correct and quick. Food was good , may not be the best ever, but pretty decent. Ambiance is fabulous, service was extremely pleasant and prompt. Nice experience overal
5
The service crew, be it the person at the reception or inside the restaurant, provided a very pleasant experience!
5
The service was immaculate. Be anamoured by the view. The dishes were worth every penny. Awesome experience!

We went there for dinner ( tip: bring a jacket, because the restaurant is cold!). While of course the view and setting are amazing, the food was sub-par unfortunately. We had two appetizers, the seared foie gras and the iberico ham. The first one was very basic (and small). The second one seemed like the Chef mixed up too many ingredients to go with the ham.For our mains, I ordered the Sirloin. The meat itself was good and tender, but the sauce and sides were bland and did not bring anything to the dish. My wife had the veal, which came in the form of an actual veal chop (we thought it would be a nice slice of veal) which was bland with nothing really to make up for the lack of taste. For dessert, we had the cheese platter which was great, but again, this was not due to the Chef but to the fact that the cheeses were good. This experience left us with the impression that for each dish the ingredients were good, but once the Chef meddled with them, the outcome wasn't tasty - pity for a Chef! One positive thing is that the staff and service were excellent, particularly the Sommelier, who matched each of our dishes with the perfect wine. In summary, if you don't care about the food and just want dinner with a view, then this is good. Otherwise, if what you want is a great view AND great food, then Equinox or other restaurants in high rises are better - hands down

Have visited Salt before, also in Australia. The signature tempura oysters are very expensive, but we've had them before & thought they were worth it. On this occasion more like fish & chip shop batter with a tiny oyster in side & seaweed salad was a tasteless garnish almost looked liked they had run low & portioned 6 serves to the 12 - extremely let down. The steak to share was nice but the sides were ordinary, the horseradish cream had no flavour, the roasted parsnips oily, the salad was good. The service was ok. I must say based on our last visit we have no intention of returning, far better value for money wow places to visit in Singapore
5
Went for restaurant week 2015 and the food is marvellous. Ambience was perfect and quality of food is spectacular. Had the scallops and it literally melts in your mouth.Impeccable service as well. This is a very easy place to go. Right perched at the top of ION orchard 55th floor. If you fancy a little walk after meal, go up to the observatory at level 56th. Beautiful as well.If you were to choose one place for a romantic meal, this should be one of your choices
5
we made a last minute reservation and salt was nice enough to accomodate our requests.. food was amazingly good modern australian with an asian influence. portions were good too and reasonably priced. in a sea of overpriced restaurants with bad food in singapore salt was a refreshing experience
5
Went here on recommendation from friends and it certainly didn't disappoint! The location and view from the 55th floor at ION Orchard was spectacular and we made sure we got there to see the sunset. I had booked the 'Wow package' as it was my wife's birthday and the extra cost was worth it for the service, cocktails, photo, rose and cake. The food was beautiful and whilst overall it is pricey you expect that for the location. I have to say however that the price was certainly worth it for the location, service and food. I would definitely come back here again
5
I am a guy who doesn't fancy expensive food and I don't think that the portion would be a lot in fine dining. However, this restaurant proved otherwise.My girlfriend and I went on 9th April 2015 since its her birthday for lunch. I am a person who can eat 2 hours of buffet non stop and both of us ordered 2 course meal each with one side for both of us to share as recommended by one waiter that the side would be huge portion. I was bloated on the way out of the restaurant and the quality of food is superb and food is cooked in perfection, no raw portion or overcooked portion. We went in around 1.30pm, the ambience is really nice. We love quiet ambience and when we went in, it wasn't empty but is really quiet.Service is really great with the waiter assisting and recommending what food is should go with another. If we did not listen to the waiter, and went along with 3 course meal, we couldn't finish it.Price for a fine dining restaurant is totally worth it with the amazing view of Singapore while we wait for food, we try to identify buildings which make us realise we miss out on a lot of places as well.Overall, 5 stars and it's a 'must go at least once' place

Right on the towers of Ion Orchard Singapore is the Salt Grill and Sky Bar, an elegant restaurant on the 55th floor overlooking Central Singapore.The restaurant is classy enough for entertaining business clients, and romantic if you’re a couple looking for a quiet corner or a celebration.In either cases, the food and ambience do go well together.Food wise, it’s a good restaurant. The food is as good as any, and that is what you have come to expect from it. It’s not spectacularly over the top memorable but certainly not bottom feeder either. It is good.The service however, is memorable. The maitre d' was awesome with its recommendations (and you would wonder if he’s the chef!), and I enjoyed my recommendations.A great evening with good food and amazing view
5
This restaurant is expensive, but the experience is priceless. The express elevator from level 4 Ion shopping centre to level 56 sets the scene for amazing views over Singapore, especially on dusk. The food is exquisite, we had the barramundi (Australian fish) to share with crab & mushrooms. Delicious! There is a fantastic wine selection and the service was excellent
4
The 55 th floor of the fancy ION plaza houses the salt and sky grill. Super views, super food and well worth a visit. The food is good but overstated. The place is a must go.
5
This restaurant is perfect for a romantic date. Experience but worth the experience. It will just less than a minute to be in the restaurant and after there will be limousine to take you to another destination.
Must try!

This has one of the nicest view of urban Singapore from this restaurant. The food is of good standard and enjoyable. Service is good and all in all, we had a nice lunch there.

Salt is one of my favorite restaurants so I was very much looking forward to the meal. This was a lunch visit during restaurant week. Unlike some restaurants where the menu for restaurant week is inferior to the regular menu, Salt never skimps because of this and the selection and quality remains excellent. The omelette starter was divine as always, and the tenderloin too. The fish main was rather disappointing however, being rather tasteless.Now for the not so good- we were seated at a little loft area, above the main hall. Some tables, including ours, were facing the tall windows so it was really hot with the noon sun. Our table was the first to arrive so I asked to be moved, but instead of changing our table, they just pulled the table an inch away from the windows! I then specifically asked for a table change, but was told tables were all booked. That may be the case, but surely as we were the first to arrive, we can just swap with another empty table?? Secondly, the intervals between courses for our table of 2 was really long.... I noted a few tables that started after us had their courses in succession. I had to ask the staff to clear our table and bring the next course more than once. Why this inconsistency in service?Perhaps I have come to expect too much from Salt. Overall still one of the best restaurants in terms of food quality
2
This place is in fact over priced and there's nothing really special about it other than the fact that we're having a meal with a view. We were expecting to be welcomed when we reached the top level, but there was no one there at the reception. The waitress was not patient when taking our orders, though the one who helped us with our wine is pretty informative and helpful.Overall, quite a disappointment
5
Visited Salt grill & sky bar twice. Both visits are having high tea with friends. The great panoramic view is an eye captioning. We love the service as all staffs are attentive and polite. Their high tea set was amazingly delightful. Overall, food, service and the environment was great. I can't wait to be back to this place again
3
This restaurant has a brilliant almost 360degree view of the city. It's especially magical watching the transformation through dusk to night. Ask for a table upstairs along the glass railing if you can. Service was attentive but unobtrusive. I only wish the food had been spectacular. I mean it was good, but not spectacular considering the price tag and the pedigree. My husband and I did 3 courses - appetizers were lovely, my steak had a big ridge of gristle through it (I was a bit sad about that) but was cooked perfectly, and dessert was ok. There is however, a pretty good wine list with something for everyone. I'd recommend this restaurant for the view, ambience and the service, but not so much for the food
5
We went there to celebrate my wife's birthday. When we got there, we were greeted by a friendly and smiling crew and they made us feel welcome. We were given a window seat with a nice view of the singapore skyline. There is also a viewing gallery which we can walk around to see the singapore skyline from different angle. For appetiser, we have the seared foie gras and salt and pepper squid. We got the sirloin steak, veal cutlet and baramundi for the mains. They looked good and tasted good too. For the dessert they gave us a chocolate cake with a personalised 'happy birthday'. It was the highlight as far as my wife is concerned. The service we received was excellent. We can feel their efforts to make it a special dinner for my wife.
3
We rated this place VG for the view, service, and ambiance. Which are the primary reason we come here for special occasions like birthdays & christmas. Food per se is average and would feel expensive if you think of paying for the taste & quality only so we think of it as paying to enjoy the view, service & ambiance while dining. That somehow justify spending an average of $200/person. My steak was medium rare and chewy, will not order it again. That said, the appetizer & desserts were good. Way better than mains. Strange it may be but we recommend appetizer & desserts, we don't recommend the main courses

Visited for brunch on the first day of Chinese New Year. My Boyfriend had made a reservation and since I was late and their last order is about to end soon. Thus, he had to go in and order first. When I reached, staff at concierge ushered me all the way to the lift. Upon reaching the restaurant, the hostess brought me to my seat. And realizing that I have a huge bag with me, they immediately gave me a box like thingy to place my bag. Napkin was opened immediately. And the food was served almost immediately too. After the meal, I was presented with an ice cream with the " Happy Birthday " wording. Requested for the staff to help capture down the moment. she recommended the best view for us. Service was prompt. View was great. Food was awesome. Serving is huge for a girl. I had a eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, sautÃ©ed mushrooms and wagyu sausage. Can't really finish. But food was great.

Great view and great service. Their food is damn delicious. Nice romantic atmosphere for couple. Pretty expensive I must say.
3
The restaurant sits on the 55th floor so needless to say the view is spectacular. The restaurant's decor is tasteful, a mix of high ceilings, simple table settings and a touch or art deco. The service was faultless, our waiter did a fantastic job and was attentive and prompt. The food started off well, the gnocchi and grilled helium were delicious, the mains (steak and red snapper) however lacked the wow factor, especially considering the cost. Dessert was nice, but again nothing we haven't had before. Overall for the cost of just under $200 per person, I found it underwhelming. Just an FYI, the amazing view can be accessed by the general public for FREE, so maybe save yourself a few hundred dollars and get some takeaway coffees and enjoy the singapore skyline

Visited during the first day of CNY 2015 celebrating my GF birthday. Reservation was made through online. We were late close to the last call of the brunch, as there are serving brunch during public holiday and weekends. I arrived around 1340 where their last order was at 1350 hrs. Luckily the managers/ chef allowed me to order the food first before my GF arrived. Climbing to level 55 with a dark lift, seems a lot of patrons that time thought they were joining the meal as me. However, they were heading to somewhere else.I was seated with the great view of singapore. Menu was presented within a minutes. Beverage order were ask as well. As the bruch service going to end, I've to place order for my brunch. 4 main choices with 2 more side to choose with, comes with a glass of Freshly squeze orange juice and coffee or tea.I've order an egg benedict as well as Aussie breakfast set.Egg benedict comes with smoked salmon gravlax, and my Aussie comes with choice of eggs, 2 toasts, crispy pork bacon.Quality of food of course comes with high price, but with the great view and great ambience, I think worth for the money that i spend. Service was great. Portion of food was good
4
We went to Salt grill which is my first Australian dining experience in Singapore ever since living there over 4 years.Took part on contest by a travel company called Jetabout Holidays and received a salt grill dining voucher. Wouldn't really go for fine-dining if not for the fact that I was aware of it.Ordered the pork belly dish and truffle oil french fries as a side dish. They're quite fresh and I especially enjoy the soft chewy & crispy texture of pork with sauce. Quite authentic though I haven't tried the coffee. So it was worth the wait. I may visit again on a special occasion
3
We went to the Salt grill and Sky bar for afternoon tea, on the occasion of a friends birthday.You reach the restaurant through a shopping mall, which is a maze, ( and I live in Singapore) The restaurant its self, you each by way of a darkened elevator.Its a beautiful, large room with fantastic views of Singapore.The afternoon tea was quite a sparse fare and but you do get copious amounts of tea to fill you up. Its a little on the pricey side and for me its basically a 'been there, done that" sort of place

I feel that if you want to open a restaurant at the top of a high rise building, it had better be a blow your mind out type of experience. Great place for dates, special occasions, proposals, celebrations, to impress your overseas friends. Great views especially at night.No the restaurant does not rotate. For drinks at the bar, good too if you want a change of scene from the grounds. The decor is nice with high ceilings, muted lighting but more can be done to it somehow. That aside, food cannot beat the experience I had in Sage, Canberra in terms of presentation and taste, nor the one in Melbourne, No.8I think generally the effort and the idea is there, just got to brush up on the finesse in the cooking time and being able to time the dish to the table. I was there with my foodie partner on Thursday night this week. Here's what we ordered:From the Tapas: Salt and Pepper Squid, miso mayo - Excellent . They cut the squid non-calamari style and love the seasoning. Miso mayo good combi. Must try!From the Mains: Pork Belly and lobster, garlic cream, tofu,enoki,ginger jus - The pork belly came in two large cubes. One was chewy and not crispy, the other was crispy enough but at the end of the chew, it still does not crumble. Lobster was cooked to perfection. In terms of colour presentation, boring. $70 I would expect more. The other main was Maple and Lavender Duck Breast, almond puree,shemeji,broad beans, onion rings. The waitress suggested this dish because the breast would be cooked almost medium well which she said would give a better eating experience. It came hard and well cooked and she graciously served me another eventually which was done perfectly. They also graciously changed the broad beans to long french beans cooked to perfection as well. I did not get a whiff of lavender but more of the maple that overpowered the lavender? Otherwise the combination was great tastewise. Our sides was Brocollini with hollandaise, toasted hazelnuts. Love the brocollini texture, sauce with the crunch of nuts were good, but i prefer pine nuts to up the class but that is individual I guess. Broccolini is already a bit bitter after taste, so hazelnuts although give the crunch, also has a bitter after taste. The sweetness of pine nuts i think would go better if using broccolini. Truffle oil and parmesan french fries smelled good when served. But the fries lost its crispiness in the cold airconditioned room fast with no taste of truffle. All that remained on the fries was the strong taste of parmesan. PS Cafe does it better somehow. We had to share a dessert due to full tummies- Chocolate Delice,salted caramel,honeycomb,praline ice cream. It was so-so for $22. The highlight was those little candy poppers that pop all over your mouth. Makes you feel like a kid once again

Great view, excellent food and service. The staff were friendly, attentive and accommodating. Took my husband there for his BD dinner and I ordered the degustation menu that came with paring wine and it turned out to be the perfect choice from starter all the way to dessert. It was a lot of food but just the right portion. If you’re looking to pamper a loved one, go for it…

My wife and I were transiting through Singapore and went into the city for dinner. We stumbled upon Salt Grill by chance and thought it would make a great end to our holiday. It was a Tuesday night and they were able to take us as a walk-in. The restaurant was busy but there appeared to be a couple more free tables.The food is a bit pricy but very high quality. We shared a salad which was great. I had a steak and my wife had fish. The Gazpacho sampler was also very tasty. The view of Singapore is unequaled. Certainly a portion of your bill goes to paying for the view on Orchard Road.For us the staff were very attentive....always clearing the table, topping our drinks, etc. The food arrived in about 15 to 20 min. The dining area is not large, but even though it was busy it did not seem loud to us. We had no complaints at all.I would recommend the place to anyone looking for fine dining in Singapore.It was interesting to also have the great view from the washrooms

How to start...we arrived very early and wanted to have some cocktails at the bar..and were told that the bar was full and we would only be able to sit at our table! So we sat and we sat...and waited for menus. After 20 minutes they arrived and another 10 minutes and lots of chasing, we managed to place an order for drinks...they took 20 minutes to arrive. So 50 minutes to get a drink.It got worse. Dinner took over an hour to arrive after our order and we were not impressed! The barramundi was tasteless having been sold as being in a spicy broth! The veal was ok but the mushrooms completely overwhelmed them. Finally in order to get to the airport we ordered a taxi...which arrived and duely left without us being informed of its arrival, causing some considerable stress.Finally to the cost! At SGD200 per head, it's probably the most expensive and least impressive meal I've had in Singapore...not a great combination

Over-rated. Terrible Service. We were literally ignored most of the evening - wait staff and head should have been "on it" especially since the restaurant was barely half full. And to boot - we waited a long time for the food to arrive. Oh - and drinks beforehand - wow - one person was served while the rest of us waited another 30 min before our cocktails arrived. The lighting at the table was awful - Wait staff should clue in on this when everyone appears to be struggling to read the menu - more lighting or candles please. What's going on here? I first sampled Salt Grill at ION upon opening - I loved it for lunches and celebrated a few birthdays here. Its severely gone down hill since. This visit was a great disappointment and an embarrassment to my husband and I, as we brought two guest couples from Australia. :-( Furthermore - we only ordered mains - one glass of wine each - no dessert or starters, our bill was $1000! The food - was average - the steak tasty, but the accompaniments and the plating left something to be desired - 'get with it' chef - please! Not willing to return anytime soon. Save your money or go elsewhere. One saving grace (thank you ION) ...the magnificent view

A wonderful view great place for a celebration wonderful food. Not cheap but well worth every penny.

If you ever want to feel "Special" and have a "Dining Experience" then Salt is the place to go. From the Concierge to the private lift the journey to Salt is an experience. The view even on a stormy day is stunning and made even better with a glass of Merlot and beautiful food. The menu options are great and the experience will remain a memory for a long time. One of Singapore's "Must Do" attractions. Make sure you reserve a window seat tho!

Planning for a b'day celebration for my hubby @ Salt Grill which of course I am keen for the window seat as i heard much about the view at level 57. Called them and was told that it has been fully booked. Btw, there is a surcharge of $20++ for a table along the window. I received a confirmation email on my reservation and they attached a "WOW package" for my reference. That is priced at $95++ per couple which consist of the window seat, a memorial photo, a stalk of rose and a cake if i don't recall wrongly. 1st thing that came across my mind - Isn't the table along the window fully booked and why are they offering me this package? Business ethic is a boo boo seriously. The window seats are available when i expressed my interest in this package. This somehow put me off. Went there during evening period. View is spectacular and other than that, nothing to wow about. We ordered 2 Appetizer which only came one:  - ‘Glass’ Sydney crab omelette, enoki mushroom & herb salad, miso mustard broth ($33++) - Disappointment and I think i can prepare this myself at home. - Seared foie gras, pine nut crust, scallops, peach, brioche - The service staff missed out this order. Main course: - Veal cutlet 280g, Northern Rivers New South Wales, garlic mushrooms, BBQ sauce ($68++) - My boy order this. A meat lover like me, was wondering how am i going to finish this? It is not about the portion. Its the taste. The meat was rough.\- Scotch 250g Rangers Valley, New South Wales, 300 days grain fed, roasted parsnips, kale & truffle jus ($82++) - Nothing to talk about. It is quite bad for the price that i am paying. Side order: - Truffle oil & parmesan French fries ($14++) - This was served to us first Soggy and Cold. This is really embarassing and i have a strong believe that the fries has been left in the open for a while. They changed the fries after we share our feedback. - Roast garlic mushrooms ($15++) - Edible among all. Sorry to say that. The bill came up close to $300 Nett. Paying for the view and dining experience at this price, I believe this gona be my 1st and last time patronizing this restaurant.

My 25th wedding anniversary was ruined. The tables were so close I could hear the conversations of the businessmen behind me and the two couples in front. It was so packed even on a weekday. To make things worse the food took one hour to arrive. We alerted the manager and the arrived after another 15 min. He tried to make up by plonking a plate of blue cheese pear salad on our table, muttering apologies. The apology sounded insincere and we hated blue cheese and left it untouched.

This is a spectacular view showing a less seen area of singapore, compared with the marina bay area.The service is great, seamless, with great staff. Appetizer the Parfait of foie gras and platter of spanish cuts were excellent. My main course of different Pork cut was not to my taste. The grilled belly skin was too soft, the pork loin dry . the baked apple was a nice compliment to the dish.The ambiance is very nice, modern decor, and great wine list.Be ready to spend S$150 per person for the food. Average of S$70 for main course. A bit pricey.but, hey we are in Singapore, the most expensive city in the world

Have not written a review in a while, but this restaurant deserves mentioning! We went last night with our 6 year old daughter and it was one of the most relaxing and pleasant diners we had in a while.We were actually looking for a "quick bite with a drink" after work and "something" Australian. Turns out the place is somewhat upscale, but not uptight (white table). The views over the city need no comment from the 55th floor! Resto is not large. It has a peaceful, relaxed, almost romantic atmosphere. It is fairly dark (you get a flashlight to read the menu). A nice change from all the bright spots in SE Asia. We did not get a window table as we only reserved 3 hours ahead, not that we expected one, place was packed. They apologized various times, the manager handed his business card.. "next time i make sure..." nice touch. Kids no problem as long as they know how to eat halfway properly.Food: outstanding. Wine: great advise, top quality, Australian. Staff: professional and accommodating. Only thing, there was a large group that got served first, as they arrived early, so the rest of the restaurant had to wait a bit for the food. We had no issues as all was very chilled. Kids Burger was fast :-) Pricing is very fair (SGD 400) for the experience in Singapore.Thank you. Will will be back soon

The restaurant is located in the city centre just above orchard MRT. It's a good place for the nice romantic dinner with great view. It has a nice classy ambience and the staff were really helpful too. I think it's quite lame to charge $20 for window seat (which we didn't opt for as I would be looking at my beautiful wife most of the time :P) and we could just walk around and enjoy the view while waiting for the food to arrive
3
Great location, fantastic views, staff extremely friendly and polite.This was a special occasion and so I paid the $20 dollars for a window seat but would not pay that again..I just think its a tad cheeky to ask.The food menu choices were sufficient for us and the wine menu extensive with prices to suit all budgets starting from the 'well off' to 'minted'! This place is not cheap but worth a visit to tick-off the list of things to do
4
Food - generous portions, was awesome. The sides (Blue Cheese pear salad and roasted mushrooms) were too much for two person, after getting appetizers (Zucchini Flowers and Gnocchi). Drinks - standard cocktails were bit blah, and took time to arrive. Service - professional, courteous and friendly, but didn't have the wow factor. Ambiance - great. Paid extra to sit right next to window, and afforded a bit of privacy away because backs were to the room. But next time, we wont need to do that. All tables have a view to the window
2
This restaurant seems to have thought that the view they command from the 55th floor of ION was sufficient to keep people coming, because at the end of the meal, that seems to be how it felt.It is a great pity that you start the process of dining with reservation staff and a website that says "$20 to guarantee a window seat". Personally, this leaves a rather sour note before we even step into the restaurant. There has to be a better way to do this, and I am afraid asking for payment just didn't cut it for me.The decor, the finishings, the view and the overall high ceiling of the place makes this place really quite beautiful. Nice and bright in the day with a lot of natural lighting, gives this restaurant a special feel to it. But the experience starts going downhill from there. Staff were polite enough but they really need more training and more finesse in explaining the menu. For a place like this, regular smiles just isn't going to work and when one cannot describe the dishes - it again puts another showstopper to the overall experience. The food - unfortunately not something we would return for. It was not bad, though I felt the steak was over salty - but by and large it was average. Again, its hard to walk away with a positive review when they started the executive set lunch with an amuse-bouche that tasted watered down.Another peculiarity - they had both an open kitchen and a closed kitchen and where the open kitchen was, two kitchen staff were busy mincing something, akin to someone continuously mincing garlic or onions (it is probably something else but this is how it sounds). In an elegant dining room with high ceilings and where sounds get a tad echoey, this sound of chopping and dicing was not a welcomed noise. It is quite different if we were seated in an open bar concept where we watch the chef cook. This isn't how it was.A lot of the soft touches are missing in this restaurant and it is highly dependent on all the hard fixtures. When you end the meal with an expensive bill and did not have a good experience, the view stops being an attraction

We had lunch in this restaurant. The meat produced was well cooked and very good. Wine was decently priced and service was perfect. Amazing view to be enjoyed from the table.
4
We had the set dinner at SALT and enjoyed its eclectic mix. Somewhat strangely, we were not allowed to order the fillet steak cooked medium rare, but in the event it turned up pretty close to that. The views are amazing and the ambience is very congenial
4
My friend invited us here for the first time as it is rather impressive. The view is spectacular and the service was of a very high standard. The food was delicious and portions were quite generous, however I found the selection rather limited. Probably would only go back for very special occasions, but worth a visit for the first timer, especially around sunset time

Read about Salt grill & Sky bar and thought would be nice to visit this place at 55th floor since I always thought ION only has 4 levels. Did a reservation online and respond was fast from Salt. I've requested would be nice if they can give us a window seat. They replied that if I pay SGD 20, they can gaurantee that window seat. I was appalled by such a request after visiting many fine-dining resto, never have such a suggestion. I didn't pay that special SGD 20, but they did give us that window seat. We ordered 2 course lunch set. Gf has Salt and Pepper Squid while I've the crab omelete. Boy! the portion is huge! I can't believe that a starter looks like a breakfast omelete and my gf has quite a large plate of fried squid. Luckily the main course Fish is a small good size. We had a side dish of vegetables. The food are tasty but very ordinary. Good list of wine by the glass. I had a glass of Chardonnay and gf has a moscato. Their Chablis by the glass is SGD 31 which I think is rather steep. The window seats are hot during lunch. We've to ask the waiter to lower the blind as half our table is in the sun and we're still perspiring. :)Overall ambience is great but food is too ordinary. Will not be back again
3
Certainly a nice place for dinner with closed ones or first date situation, this is because of the view from the rest. The food is average is my perspective, i have better food at lower price. I certainly feel the price is too pricey, but if you want a nice view of singapore, this place is a right choice. Service is good
2
The whole setup of the restaurant is great starting with the lift lobby. The service staff are all very attentive and fast. However, the food is pretty average to poor. My steak was nothing special, though it was supposed to be Australian Wagyu, it felt like meat from Cold Storage. When we ordered some cheese after dinner and some bread, it took the kitchen staff more than 15 min to put it on a plate! For bread!! And the place was not even full! Service staff apologized repeatedly for the kitchen staff. For the price one should expect better food. Frankly the Tapas grill from the same chef is better at Raffles place. If you are looking for a restaurant with a view, head to Swisshotel! Kitchen staff and food really is the low point of this plac

The iON centre is one of Singapore's most reknown shopping centre. On the top of the centre, on the 55th floor, 215 metres high, there is a bar and restaurant with an Australiant flavour. There is a seperate lift and entrance to the bar and before one enters, one is requested to obey the rule of consumption, 20S$ p.p. for drinks and 40S$ for food. There is an obvious reason for the limited access because of the stunning 360 degree view of the city one is able to see from there. The restaurant is well equipped and serves great food prepared by their Australian chef. 3-course lunch menus start at 45S$ p.p. (excluding service and VAT charge). The quality of the food is very high and the staff is very friendly and professional (different from the first time my daughter had a drink there). This might be a good place to start your visit to Singapore in order to get a good orientation of the city. There are signs everywhere of what you are looking at. A visit to the bathroom is also worth it, especially if one wants to take a photo of oneself with the great view

Visited Salt Grill and Sky bar in October with three others. We had the Afternoon tea which was reasonably priced for what you got. Could have been a little more food but we weren't devastated. The view is absolutely outstanding and well worth visiting just for that. Had to wait for about 40 minutes after we finished our afternoon tea for our tea and coffee which only came after asking for it twice

Was there on a sat night to celebrate my hubby's birthday. Had wanted to go many times to try out this place but after several failed attempts and plus the fact of the poor reviews on the food, we decided to give this place a miss! However, this time round, I decided to give this place a try. I make my reservation via hungrygowhere.com and it gives me instant confirmation. Not a bad choice after all. The restaurant was packed on a sat night. However service was swift and pleasant throughout.. We asked for recommendation from the lady who served us and it proves to tell that the staff know the menu well...for mains, we ordered a wagyu beef ( cut of the day) at $89 for 150g, tasting of pork which consists of 3 different types of pork at $70 and a appetizer smoked quail plus a side of garlic mushroom. I would say all the dishes did not disappoints. The beef was certainly tender , the 3 different types of pork meat was delicious ( if you are a pork lover) , the smoked quail was done very nicely.. The price of dining here is definitely not cheap. The food is ok not that bad ( as many reviews had said was poor). You really Gota try it yourself to judge. If you want a window seat, you can pay more to secure the table. But personally, due to the hazey weather, it not worth the view
3
We visited this restaurant in October for dinner and while it was nice enough, it definitely wasn't worth the price tag. The view is ok, but in hazey Singapore, it can be difficult to see anything, plus sitting by the window will cost you extra. The menu isnt huge, we had squid for entree which had too much batter and was quite bland. The steaks were delicious but very expensive and very small ($89 for a piece of meat and 3 peices of asparagus) - we've had better in Aus for a quater of the price (but when in Rome!). Staff were attentive and pleasant but the environment feels a little sterile and lacks soul. If you do want to visit while in Singapore, make sure you book (especially for dinner
5
This was one of the highlights of our latest stay in Singapore. Not as cheap as Maxwell Rd Hawker Centre, but every bit as caring about the food quality. A great lunch, a gret place, a fantastic view.
5
The restaurant and sky bar is a very nice relaxed place, we enjoyed the food and wine very much, Staff was always around and taking good care, onely the Air con is way to cool, so make sure to bring a warm jacket.

A bit aussie food but very nice and good portions . Customer service at a high standard and Great views of the city on a good day . Executive lunch very nice and fixed price but filling .

We ordered the steak tartar, tuna tataki, steak, lemon tart and souffle! all was excellent! It's quite interesting to

Made a reservation for 10th Sept 2014 12.30 pm for a Girls out Chit-Chat session hence we expected to have our lunch and high tea till late afternoon.(1) Requested for a warm water several times for one of my pregnant friend and it was not served till an hour later.(2) Ordered for a pot of tea but the tea never arrived.(3) Was told around 1.25pm that the kitchen will be closed at 1.30pm as they will be having a private function at 2.30pm. Which means the whole restaurant will be closed for a private function!! We were taken aback with the information as we had not even started our lunch. We had no prior knowledge about this when we book online and when we arrived at the Level 4 concierge, we were not informed!! Otherwise, we could have changed the location! In the end, we had to hurry through the lunch so that they can clear the area for the private function. The food is pretty average and I would get better food and service in other restaurant with the same amount that we paid.The only good thing about this place is the view otherwise not recommend for anyone to dine there. Would not expect this type of service for the prices that we have to pay. A very disappointing experience!! Neither I nor my friends will return
3
The food is ok, although it has some anomalies for Europeans eg French fries with parmesan and truffle oil ……… Food that is to be expected from a upscale chain concept. So accept that and enjoy the view from the 55th or 56th floor. Staff are friendly, but do not succeed in making you feel at home, to much of a organised factory feel about it

Had difficulty getting the line through for special birthday arrangement. The restaurant has a policy for no outside food allowed. When I managed to call in after much tries, I was advised that someone else will call me but there was no call from the restaurant after two days. I only managed to get through the line after 2nd dial on the actual day to inform the restaurant about the birthday lunch and to arrange special dessert. At the restaurant, I had to ask for the dessert menu. The waitress who attended to us actually asked if there was a special birthday occassion. Despite my email and calls to indicate that the it was a birthday lunch celebration, the waitress asked the question. Total turn-off. Private properties view for window seating... I was expecting city view with beautiful infrastructure. As for food... we had brunch set. My egg benedict was overcooked..sides were fine. Nonetheless, prestige of travelling to the restaurant via private lift was something new.
3
Well.....its ok but not fantastic. Wasnt impressed as maybe set my expectations way too high. Steak was nice but it didnt have anything special about it. Good produce and well cooked but was really expecting some fine touch or something else. Service was nice as we went to celebrate my wife bday
1
Made a reservation online which was confirmed and received a confirmations via email and SMS, had to pay $20 for a window seat. Plus they know its my anniversary celebration because they emailed me back asking if I would like to have something special written on the dessert. Fast forward one day they later they said the table isn't available and that I had to wait till 8.45pm maybe get a table that I want. Geez if you can't even do simple planning for your seating arrangements maybe you should not have taken the reservations. Deeply disappointed
4
My girlfriends brought me to this restaurant for my birthday lunch. This is my first time to this restaurant and I like it that they usher their guests from Level 4 concierge to the direct lift lobby of the restaurant.The scenery at Level 57 was of course captivating. Service was good.We ordered the 2 course set lunch each as we were not sure how big the portion was though was told the portion was trying size. However it was not as small as we thought. We had the starter and fish for main. We enjoyed the 2 dishes and were pretty full after this. Will definitely recommend this place if you are looking for worthy set lunches with nice panoramic view
3
Came here with a group for an Afternoon Tea birthday celebration ... At $30 per head not bad for a little treat... Good for visitors but wouldn't come regularly. Scones were normal size, everything else was tiny.... Except the "Florentines" which should have been tiny but looked more like cranberry & almond cookies. I don't have a sweet tooth so swapped 3 of the sweet selections for savoury. Service was lacklustre. I don't expect staff in this calibre of place to lounge at vacant tables playing with their phones or eating their noodles. View is good but unlike Marina Bay Sands you can come up to the observatory platform for free. That's what I'll be doing in future
2
Celebrated the birthday of a friend at this place and chose the Premium Degustation menu. Food was average at best, and definitely did not warrant the prices charged. Servers lacked finesse for a place like this, and portioning was inconsistent. They got all the hardware right but need to put in a lot of effort to refine the software of this place to match with their offering. Whoever was working at the pass needs to be replaced
3
Visited with a work colleague for dinner. The staff were pleasant and the food tasted nice though I wouldn't rave about it. The view is great if seated by a window, otherwise you are seated too far away to enjoy the sites (as I was).Not sure that this would be on my things to do list if visiting Singapor
4
I was there in first week on September on an business lunch. View is fantastic. Food is good. One can get set lunch menu with 3 course at $80++. Set menu option is not bad...starter..main course..dessert. good few options in each course. Over all experience is good. They have their own cocktails which are good as well. Restaurant waiters can be of good help in case of menu selection
3
We have lunch there and were seated at the table overlooking Singapore from the 55th floor of Ion Building at the main shopping street. The view was nice but unfortunately it was a very sunny day and sitting next to the window was hot! At night unless you sit next to the window that overlook Marina Bay on the other end of the restaurant otherwise the view was not brilliant and was dark.We were given some bread and olive oil and dukkah in the beginning of the meal. The bread was very ordinary and the olive oil did not taste nice. We had squids which were quite tasty. The risotto was tasty and the chicken was not particular nice. Service was good.All in all, I think it is quite an ordinary meal but charged at a high price. I will not go back again

It says a lot about a restaurant when the view is better than the meal – and unfortunately, Salt Grill seems to be laying on this laurel and not delivering much when it comes to food. Booked this restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary. First off, I found it incredibly tacky that you pay $20 for a guaranteed table by the window. Really?? I thought this was a classy joint and have never heard of this practice. That coveted seat at a window table felt like a commodity, rather than a treat but I am glad we paid for it, because the view was great. Service was just fine, the sommelier was very knowledgeable and helpful and recommended a very nice wine ($140). We were then served some cold, tasteless sliced bread with olive oil and dukkah. Not impressed at all. No warm, freshly-baked dinner rolls to be found here! A salmon-based amuse bouche which followed was a nice touch. We then ordered the pan-fried gnocchi and cigar of whipped sheep’s cheese to start. These dishes were really so ordinary in flavour – the gnocchi were a nice texture, but were not pan-fried well enough to have a nice crispy edge. Mains ordered were the wagyu and fillet steaks, garlic mushrooms, and truffle fries. Steaks were very well cooked and the sides were delicious. The chocolate delice dessert was also quite nice. Given it was our anniversary (and they were aware), perhaps a complimentary cup of coffee as a token gesture would have been nice - but by this time, my expectations were dying a slow death. Our bill was almost $600, for what was a nice, but average steak and veg meal really. We are so spoilt for choice in Singapore I can name at least five other restaurants, where the steaks are as good if not better - and the prices are far more reasonable. In summary: opulent surroundings, great view, ho-hum service, expensive for rather average food ( please sort that bread out, it was horrendous)

I had about 6 hours between flights at Changi, so I called Salt and made a reservation. I don't ever do 'celebrity chef' restaurants, and tend to avoid restaurants with a view (all about the view, not the meal), but a friend recommended it, so on I went. Two changes of metro from the airport got me to the station in the basement of the ION Orchard building, where Salt lies on the top floor. Met by the concierge on the 4th floor and led to the escalator to the top; very slick. Good greeting by the Maître 'd and seated, not by a window unfortunately, but you can wander round and take in the views as you like. It was sunset and that was magnificent.I found the service to be fine (except for one time when I was after a drink refill and seemed abandoned for 10 minutes and couldn't catch anyone's eye). The dishes were well presented and very enjoyable. Couldn't fault it actually. Mind you, you pay for it!After dinner, it was back on the metro and straight back out to the airport. Again, very convenient.Overall, it was a very good experience, albeit expensive. I'm not sure that I'd need to go back, given other choices in Singapore, but there was nothing too wrong on the night
2
We went there for dinner on the weekend and unfortunately Salt confirms all the generalizations about restaurant's with a great view. Poorly conceived and presented food combined with average service result in a very ordinary dining experience
5
Went here in a large group (10-15 people) after a business meeting on a Saturday night. Service was on the slow side, but the place was packed so I would say that was understandable. However I found they lack the warmth and personal touch that would make the experience more memorable. Atmosphere was charming and the view excellent, windows were large enough and tables well-situated to get good view almost anywhere in the restaurant. Food was also great. I had the tea-infused quail entree and beef steak accompanied by nice wine. The quail was just okay; the white meat came out a bit bland but sauce was rich enough to compensate. The steak was especially delightful, large portion, prepared medium-well done, tasty and juicy till the last bite without being too rare in the middle as sometimes would happen in a steak that thick. Dessert was my least favourite course, the ginger sorbet did not appeal to me at all. Overall a great dinner and experience. Service definitely had room for improvement
4
We were greeted by coldness at level 4 as the lady was on the phone while signaling us to the lift leading to the sky bar. When we arrived at 55, there was no one to bring us to a table. Following the Japanese couple before us, we explored the view from the top of Orchard District before entering the restaurant. The high tea had yummy goodies. Only the scones and some sourish jelly was awful. For the price and the view, definitely worth a few visits. Just don't expect much from their service!
3
View was lovely; however felt menu needed a bit more choice. Appetisers were better than the main course. Large steak portions if you are a meat lover
5
Fantastic food and cocktails. Loved the interesting view.
My partner and I had to laugh though when Luke Million's "Arnold" came on over the stereo system. Loved it!
5
Great ambience, views and excellent wait staff. Prices are expensive but keeps the crowd away and the number of diners small. Fantastic experience and will be back!
5
Great ambience, great views, great food, not you average price range, but one of those things that be thankful for doing.

Perched high above Singapore in ION tower, the room was large, open & airy. The view was stunning, looking down on Singaporeâ€™s skyline. Service was fine early on (more later). The food was well-cooked & nicely presented (mashed potato was perfect!) & the sides were very tasty (try the broccolini). Good quality but the prices are rather high here, and do mind the wine prices too which are very expensive indeed even for Singapore. We were the last table to leave but when we went down in the elevator to the taxi-pick-up point the place was locked up. We were left to wander the mall (at the base of ION) looking for a way out. Ridiculous - where were the Salt staff to guide patrons? Other than that, very solid

From the Lv4 Concierge counter to being seated in the restaurant, you are pampered by the best service you can probably expect from service staff who are attentive to your every need.Luke Mangan helms this fine establishment and honed his craft under the famed Michel Roux so the quality of food is top-notch and the food plating is beautiful - taste wise I'm a fan of the crab omelette and barramundi fillet which is always perfectly cooked.If you are out to impress a date or to celebrate a romantic anniversary, the view from the 55-storey establishment won't fail you (waiters will get you a window seat if available and you are free to roam around)I will continue to patronise this restaurant and it's been nothing but pure bliss so far

I have been to this restaurant in Ion shopping Orchard road. The restaurant is on the 55th floor with private elevator from 4th floor. The atmosphere is very fine with nice view is Singapore. The food is very tasty with nice presentation. Service is very good bad helpful. Six ways oyster is nice and interesting. I might recommend this restaurant to someone who seek nice restaurant for relaxing.

We wanted somewhere special to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary and chose Luke Mangan's Salt Grill. Everything about it was excellent. Great view, great food and wine and very good staff who managed to leave a message on my wife's dessert and coffee. My wife bought the recipe book and we have tried some of them at home. Top notch
5
Sky high view and prices but we loved it. Excellent service and food. Luke has set up a great place here. We did lunch on the Saturday and it was not full. Seated near the window it was a wonderful spot to enjoy the sights of Singapore and the company of a loved one. A great range of drinks that can be skilfully food matched by the staff or you. Share meals are a good concept. Perfect location, views, food and company

I went for lunch on my own after booking in online.i arrived an hour late (1st time traveling to singapore) but was allowed in.the way to get to the restaurant is cool:dark corridors and lifts.once there the view ia amazing! I opted for a window seat (extra $20).for lunch I had the duck liver pate and the lemon risotto (entree size) both were divine! Size wise its really good! I also had a glass od wine ($14!!!).the bill was $90 included gst which I though was goo

just feel that with that kind of price, u can get similar elsewhere...I feel its a little overrated although I must say the ambience is top-notch

This place provides their customer with a different sense of dining even before reaching the restaurant. Customer will be usher to a private lift that goes up to the restaurant and you will be greeted by the staffs to the table.They serve nice bread before the meal and a window seats serve a nice view of Singapore from orchard. But during sunset, it can be a little hot and glaring. Had a salmon dish and a steak dish. The salmon was really fresh and the accompanied king prawn was nicely BBQ that you can taste smoke in its meat. As for the steak, it is very well cook to the required standard, every bite was juicy and tender. Really fantastic meal!The day was ended with a very fine dessert that was heavenly. Oh ya, once awhile they will have famous chef coming to provide special menu for a certain period. This definitely can give customers something new to look out for.Do make reservations when visiting.

We had gone to salt Grill to spend our wedding anniversary to have a special evening and we had just that - a great evening.Right from the entrance at the 4th level the service was polite, attentive & discrete. The food was great with very nice flavors. My Lobster tail tortellini was a very small serving but it was very tasty. My wife had the tea infused quail which was full of unique & bold flavors. We had the meat to share. The steaks perfectly cooked, moist & succulent. The accompanying salad of Pear & Blue cheese was blended perfectly without the overpowering taste of blue cheese. The mashed potato was also a delight. On the whole the food was perfect and evening very pleasant.It is not cheap but still value for a special occasion. it is unfortunate that we could not get the window seat. As the view from 55th floor is just amazing

For full review and photos, please visit: http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2014/03/set-lunch-at-salt-grill-sky-bar-2.htmlSalt Grill is a stylish restaurant set against the backdrop of the breathtaking Singapore skyline view with full floor to ceiling glass windows . Helmed by celebrity chef Luke Mangan that offers Luke's special style of contemporary Australian cuisine. You can expect high quality food here and you can also indulge in pre or post-dinner drinks at their Sky Bar on the 56th floor

The view is really the best thing about the restaurant but the food was pretty good too. Oysters were fresh and tasty and I had the whole snapper which was tasty but very small. Cocktails were good but very small glasses for the price. Overall nice but over priced for what we got
5
It is hard to fault Salt in any way, and in many ways they exceed the high expectations I had of the restaurant. I came here for mothers day. While there was only a set menu ( I was aware of this in advance), there was good variety and some really bold tastes served. All dishes were cooked to perfection, service was really great, coupled with an amazing view, this was a meal to remember. Possibly my best dining experience in Singapore.

I've had the pleasure of dining at Salt Grill twice before and even the tapas outlet at Raffles City. The meats are well selected and certainly cooked to perfection, which is to be expected. The portions tend to be on the smaller side if you're the sort who prefers steak houses American sized so I'd recommend having a few additional sides. Truffled fries are a cop-out side because it's cheap truffle oil and not real truffles but fries are a guilty pleasure of mine so if you're not the sort who thinks that you could get the same thing at McDonalds for a fraction of the price then order the darn truffled fries to go with your steak.Now I didn't get to see the bill this time since it was a business dinner and I was not the host but what irked me immensely during was that the waitress kept rattling off the prices of the meats. It was like this cut at $86 market price blah blah blah and that is $120 market price blah blah blah.I get it, you don't want to shock your guests with a surprise bill at the end, but there has to be a better way to do it. Frankly, anyone who is coming to a place which serves $13++ fries would probably prefer to be informed about the prices with a little more class.So YES the food is good but it doesn't delight. But that's the thing about steaks.But NO, I'd rather not be fixated about the price of the meat I am ingesting

Visit my site at ms-skinnyfat for more reviews!I like to dine with the world under my feet and if you do too, then scoot over to the newly refreshed Salt Grill & Sky Bar at ION Orchard which provides a magnificent landscape of the Orchard Road skyline with their full glass floor-to-ceiling windows that span two storeys high. Swanky it is, Salt grill & Sky Bar serves up some Modern Australian cuisine by celebrity chef-restaurateur Luke Mangan and is known for its one-of-a-kind experience that begins even before guests enter the restaurant. Special concierge reception, private lift, exclusive dining area... it's hard not to feel special here.Modern Australian cuisine is an intersection of influences from cuisines around the world and i could taste that rightaway in the Amuse Bouche, Coconut broth with Sydney spice. Flavor-wise, it tasted very much like Thai Green Curry without the spice.We then proceeded with our wine and dine event and our dishes were paired with drinks from the Award Winning New World Wine List of the Year 2013 by the World Gourmet Summit. There is also the signature range of eponymous 'Luke Mangan' wines which are produced in one of Australia’s leading wine estates - TarraWarra Estate in Yarra Valley, which Chef Mangan was personally involved in the selection of the grapes and the blending of the wines.Spring vegetables were served with the mild goats curd, ginger bread crumbs and dried black olives ($31). These are probably sous vide to seal in the freshness of spring.I love my eggs and the 'Glass' Sydney crab omelette ($33) totally won me over with the precious sheets of runny egg in the center, enoki mushroom and herb salad in miso mustard broth. A generous serving of sweet crab meat was wrapped in the golden parcel. This is certainly a light dish that is refreshing with a basil taste (again, this is almost Thai food). Signature starters include the Tea smoked quail ($31), an original creation in which the bird is smoked with a combination of earl grey tea and rice, and nicely paired with almond cream, prunes, truffled grains (i believe there is quinoa), grilled shallot, sorrel. There are so many dimensions and flavors to this dish and i was slowly savoring each component. I haven't had prunes in a dish for sometime and it went well with the smokey tender quail.For mains, we had the Sirloin Rangers Valley, New South Wales, 300 days grain fed Wagyu ($74). Moroccan spice, sauté spinach, eggplant puree, red wine sauce Wasabi, whole grain mustard. Fantastic aubergine spiced purée. Pick your cut from the meat board before having it grilled to your preference (only medium rare for me).Dessert was pleasantly surprising with Luke’s liquorice parfait ($18). I don't quite like licorice but i was amazed at how interesting the flavor and texture worked together especially with lime. You gotta try it for yourself

The food was good, view was great, but charge 20 dollars on top of a 1200 bill for 4 people? Not so cool! Got a surprise on the way home when I looked at the bill and found there's a 20 dollar charge says window seats. Seriously, we spend about 1200 there and you are still charging 20 dollars on top of it. Found it a bit ridiculous and that was the first one for me after traveling so many places around the world ...

I came here with friends for restaurant week promotion and luckily we got a table. Normally for dinner, minimum spend per head is SGD60, but for restaurant week, you can enjoy a 3-course meal for just SGD55, which is super good value for the quality of the food. The portion of the food was about right for me, though may be a bit small for big guys. They had this special dip for bread - which was just grounded pepper, salt and some herbs but tasted super good. The tenderloin was about right too, and the chocolate tart and ice-cream dessert was one of the best I've ever had.The ambience of the restaurant is nice too and at 55/F the view should be nice BUT the windows were a bit dirty and our seat was a bit far from the window so couldn't really see much. But overall a great experience
5
Enjoyed a business dinner here. The views just before sunset show the city at its best. Watching the sun set is magic. The food is really good - fresh ingredients and good variety. Enjoyed crab omelette in miso soup for entree and a steak cooked perfectly medium rare for mains. Special place and would recommend.

It's my second time going to this restaurant during Restaurant Week,and it seems they have taken past feedback and improved on the portioning. The portions this time was bigger and worthy of the $40+17% price tag. The menu did not vary much from last year's, but when the food is that good, why change it? This year I had the salmon appetizer (raw carpaccio style); the salmon was fresh, the seasoning light, and the saucing restrained. With fish that fresh, not much was needed. The barramundi main course was perfectly cooked; the skin was crispy and the fish just cooked, served at the perfect temperature. The accompanying Belgian endive was a little overcooked, with no remaining crunch nor bright color. I didn't touch the capsicum (hate the stuff) so I can't comment.The dessert was the most memorable part of the meal, because it was my first ever lemongrass pannacotta and it was sublime. It was served with a superbly refreshing ginger beer sorbet and grilled pineapple. That was a party in my mouth.Service has noticeably improved; our server was warm and attentive (as opposed to previous visit's haughty and cold). This time they also made an effort to banter a little bit and to explain the food when they arrive. Major plus for that. The only downside was the girl at the door. As we were seated, we asked for a table by the window and she said she will check. She seated seven other tables while we waited and refused service. After a while, I got fed up with the royal runaround, got up and asked her again at the door. She barely glanced at the "list", and finally caved and moved us to a window table. Nevertheless, I'll be back next year for Restaurant Week (because the regular a la carte menu prices are just cray cray)

Had the opportunity to try this place out during Restaurant Week. Very impressed with the choices available - 3 choices for entrees and mains. The salmon entree was so nicely presented that u almost can't bear to touch it. But once u have a little taster, u almost want to gobble it all at once. It was such a light, delicate dish - absolutely superb. The crab omelette was also very tasty, i felt it was more chinese-asian tasting. They were really generous with the crab. The miso broth was very delicious.Had the beef tenderloin as my main and it brought back memories of my time in Australia many years ago. Loved the thick-cut tenderloin and how juicy it was. Meshed with the red wine jus, it was pure heaven! The mash and pumpkin puree was absolutely delightful.Tried both desserts on the menu. An innovative lemongrass panna cotta with ginger beer sorbet, which was surprisingly nice. The chocolate cake was the clear winner for me, with the hazelnuts and honeycomb pieces and praline ice cream. Left u wanting more!Service was great! Smiley people all around. We had a table by the window with the most awesome view. Even had the luck to witness both seasons during lunch - sunny view of Singapore, and a whitewash of rain. Nothing could dampen our moods though! Spotted Luke Mangan after lunch, would have gone up to say hi, if he didnt look like he was in a serious meeting.Go try this place if u haven't! A piece of heaven in the clouds

We had the privilege of dining at Salt Grill & Sky Bar during restaurant week and it was one of the most enjoyable restaurant experiences in Singapore.The cured salmon appetiser was light and fresh, the tenderloin main course was juicy and succulent (potato mash was smooth and creamy) and the chocolate dessert was absolutely delightful! Too sinful, in fact.Unfortunately it was pouring heavily when we were there and we were unable to appreciate the view.Would definitely love to return again - perhaps this time at night for the lovely Singapore city night view

Yes its still good but the novelty has worn off the food, the service and the ambience.Renovations going on don't help the atmosphere as advised leave before 2pm or we start renovating and its noisy ... ok we did The food is good, not fantastic any more.The service good .. but not fantasticThe view is good but it is only a view and we come for foodA little more attention to the details that made this place very good .. a staff training .. a menu review .. hard to say. Yes i will come back again .. then we will see if its the last time

I attended a client dinner on a Saturday night as an intermediary in putting two important Asia region big shots together. The restaurant is a bit difficult to locate, starting with the concierge desk on Level 4 of the ION Orchard skyscraper. After confirming the reservation, one of the staff escorted us to a private elevator - the immediate surroundings of the elevator are shrouded in near total darkness, and the inside of the elevator so dark that one could hardly locate the buttons to go to the 55th floor. I would increase the lighting around and inside the elevator.Our window-side table had been set in advance with different glassware for champagne, wine, and water. First impression, quite elegant.From there, the restaurant left me with the feeling that it still doesn't quite click - similar to some other reviews here. The wine list (like the food) seems extremely overpriced. The bread delivered as a starter was quite ordinary. Each of our party ordered one of the steak entrees, and the others seemed fairly satisfied. Staff had difficulty explaining the differences among the steak cuts, and one order came out wrong. Not things you expect in such an expensive restaurant. My steak was average, and all were extremely overpriced. I am partial to creamed spinach as a plate complement, but Salt Grill serves its steaks atop a small bed of green beans. The side dishes (without creamed spinach) went largely untouched.Our party ended the evening with the roasted peach dessert and a chocolate delice. The delice was excellent; the roasted peach again, quite ordinary.I will not return nor will I recommend friends to dine here. Simply too overpriced and the staff too spotty in attending to diners' needs

I am a regular customer at the Salt Grill, mainly for its innovative executive lunch menu, fast service and great views - which make for a reliable way to entertain out-of-town business guests.Sadly, the food and service have been slowly deteriorating and today was my worst experience to date.The meal started well with a wonderful zingy starter - kingfish carpaccio with ginger. I then tried the slow cooked duck breast with caramelised endive, which was disappointingly tough and chewy. It really didn't have the texture or flavour of a slow cooked dish. My colleague ordered the baramundi, which looked very nice but unfortunately our side orders (of broccolini and heirloom tomatoes) arrived ten minutes apart and only after we had almost finished our mains.The greatest disappointment was the dessert. We ordered the tasty-sounding "vanilla roasted peach with toasted almonds and bay leaf ice cream". After a very long wait, the dessert arrived and looked very appetizing. Sadly, the peaches proved to be almost tasteless and the dish was very poor. We politely passed this feedback to the waitress who returned with a reprimand for us from the chef who said we should have eaten the peach with the ice cream - "to give it the correct balance of sweetness". We were utterly bemused by this comment. The peach was simply unripe and tasteless - and the bay leaf ice cream was more savory than sweet. There's nothing worse than a chef who refuses to accept constructive feedback from his guests. - in fact, that's the main reason I'm writing this review.The final straw at the end of our still salvageable lunch was being informed that we couldn't order coffee because the coffee machine was 'spoiled'. I find it incredible that a restaurant of this calibre was unable to find a back up coffee machine for it's lunch time service. We were charged $235 for this disappointing meal. (The only thing worth paying for was the starters, one main course and a glass of wine each). It looks like I'll be finding an alternative venue from now on to entertain my out of town guests. This restaurant launched with such great potential. What a shame it couldn't be sustained

The view from the excellent if small bar is superb.The food was awesome, the curried scallop starter was to die for and the white truffle fries went well with my ribeye steak, the steak was a tad overcooked but otherwise fine. The wine list is not huge and tends on the high side but reasonable bottles exist. As in many asian restaurants we had to change wines twice as they only had 1 or 2 of each label
5
We really enjoyed our evening at Salt. The food was delicious! The atmosphere was upscale, but comfortable. Of course the view was great too! We will be back! As titled, I wish we had not waited so long to try Salt. We live a short walk away. We went as a family with 2 high schoolers and 1 one in primary. It was fine. There was a kid's menu for my youngest. I would not suggest so great for toddlers or babies, but I did see one. The prices were a pleasant surprise for living in Singapore. The service was great
1
Over priced, over rated and simply one of the worst meals I have had in Singapore. I took my wife for her birthday hoping to spend a pleasant evening not only with a view but also with a unique dining experience. Unique the view was however the dining experience was simply lousy. This restaurant would be a perfect candidate for a tv show that rates the worst at the top. I just hope that chef luke cooks better than his employees. Cooking should be from the heart and not from the pocket

The best Christmas meal anywhere and a great dining experience,the best views anywhere. The staff are amazing and the food fantastic. No better view than here.

My 2nd time here but 1st time for dinner. Made a reservation and noticed they charged $20 for a window table. It works out to be a small % of the total bill if you come in a group and have dinner, but it still seemed mercenary to me. Perhaps the traditional "first come first served" method may be betterWe opted for the degustation menu, as some reviewers noted, the mains are mostly in the $60-70 range, so a 3 course a la carte meal may set you back at the same cost as the degustation. pros and cons for both of courseThe amuse busche was a beetroot broth of some sort, which might not appeal to most asians actually. The kingfish carpacio was good, the crab with miso broth was better. The foie gras was tiny, the barrumundi was good but had burnt skin. The steak was a larger portion than i expected, and the chocolate dessert was ok. We mentioned in passing it was my friend's bday and they put a candle on his dessert, which was a nice touchOverall service was great and friendly, and certainly i'll return at some pointThey are renovating in march and converting the bar upstairs to a private dining room. The bar then move downstair

If you are looking for a special place for a meal and fabulous view, this restaurant on the 55-56 Floor towering the Orchard Road scene is the right place to go to. We were there for the New Year Eve dinner, hoping for a very special evening. However, we were rather disappointed with the food which we expected to be much better than it actually turned out to be. At best the food is average, despite the impressive photos and descriptions. What was even more disappointing was the extremely limp atmosphere for a new year eve event. With the exception of one lady (probably the manager) trying to bring some celebratory spirit into the evening, the rest of the staff there were obviously not too pleased about having to work that night. No cheer or wishes greeted us at countdown and we left without anyone even looking in our direction...after all we had paid the bill earlier so no further need for the plastic courtesy, I suppose.On a last note, I dont recommend ever taking up a drinks package...best to pay as you consume. The offerings under the package are not worth paying for...limited and of lesser quality than you would expect
4
Its the view and the food you pay for but you really do get what you pay for.Like many Asian restaurants, the air-con was set at 'freezing' so take a jacket. The window tables cost more ( which is really ridiculous as the view can be seen from most tables). Wine in Asia is always expensive and not well understood so take care you get what you order. Staff could do with more wine training. I think the prices have increased but the food is good and, after all, its a luxury silver service meal so expect the worse

I've been to Salt & Sky several times, both for personal and business visits since it opened at the top of the Ion. With a great location overseeing the night view of Singapore, it was one of the best "mile-high" restaurants in town. I went there last night with my family, my first time there in over a year. Some things were just as good as ever, but there were two things that noticeably changed.The good as ever stuff? Food was excellent. The ambience was its usual elegance with the same spectacular views of Singapore at night.The two things that changed? Prices....they seemed almost 50% higher than the last time I went. Steaks and lamb went for over SGD70. Appetizers were the cost of main dishes in most places. The other was warmth, or lack thereof....I recall one of my earlier visits - the aircon was a bit cold but the service was warm and friendly. The manager came over at that time and arranged wraps for my wife and daughter. This time around, the service was coldly efficient. In fact too efficient when the waiter reached across the table to top up my wine glass. I had to quietly tell him that it was rude and in bad form to do that - he should have come around to my side of the table. If I pay the kind of prices they charge, the very least I would expect is warmth, friendliness and a very welcoming attitude from everyone. There were a few friendly servers but overall we did not feel welcomed. I will likely not return
4
My husband and I had Christmas lunch here. I booked a table by the window and the view was amazing (they do charge $20 for these tables which I thought was cheeky - even though I was made aware of it when I booked).The food was great and the service attentive. We would suggest that staff would need a little more training for a fine dining restaurant. We noticed the table next to us got their mains straight after the entree. If you're spending the money at these types of restaurants we prefer to wait a suitable time between course so we can relax and enjoy the restaurant. We received our entrees before even receiving our drink order and before we had finished the bread so we made sure we asked them to wait 20mins between each course so we could digest. The maître de understood this and ensured relayed it to the service staff.Extensive wine list but very expensive. We ordered a bottle only to find out they didn't have the named vintage we asked for (luckily we know to check the vintage on the bottles so we opted to chose another wine) which is disappointing.Overall it was a very expensive lunch and while we enjoyed it, at the end of day it was not really worth what we paid. We're not strangers to fine dining but felt this experience didn't meet the pricing

I booked for a Saturday lunch, being on my own. My intoduction to the restaurant by the staff was icy cold and it was later apparrent to me that the staff go about their business in a distinctly robotic manner and have very little social interaction with the clientelle. The restaurant setting is spectacular, but with the robotic staff, lacked any personality and lets face it that it is not just the food but the overall experience that makes for a memorable dining occasion.The food is no doubt good and there are choices ranging from a comprehensive degustation menu (S$150 pp), a concise 2 course chefs menu (good value at about S$45), tapas plates (pricey per plate) and a call-off menu. Wine selection is good, but prices are up there even by Singapore standards. I was a bit surprised when advised that one of the ingredients in my selected entree dish was not available and would need to substituted. At least they asked if it would be OK, but I would not expect a restaurant of this calibre to run out of ingredients. The dishes I chose were however very tasty and ample in portion.In summmary, a good meal spoilt by an ambience lacking in any personality. Would I return? - yes, but only if someone else is paying the bill
5
We made our reservations just a day before our dinner there so we were quite saddened that we didn't manage to get a seat by the windows. Having said that, the meal we had made up for everything we had missed. Service was good - waitstaff were very attentive, was there to recommend dishes and to talk us through some specials. Excellent food served and here's the list of the things we had, with comments:1) Charcuterie plate: Jamon Iberico de bellota, chorizo Iberico, saucisson, cornichons, olives, grissini, caper berries -- recommended and not too much for 4 pax2) Salt and pepper squid, char grilled lime and miso mayo -- perfectly seasoned and spicy3) Curry spiced scallops, carrot cumin puree, crispy cauliflower, drunken raisins -- there were only 3 on the plate, and 4 of us. It took a lot of willpower to not order another plate for myself4) White onion soup, slow cooked hen’s egg, chorizo -- PERFECT. I wanted more5) Pan fried potato gnocchi, corn, asparagus, zucchini, parmesan, thyme, truffle verjuice dressing (entree size, vegetarian friendly) -- good choice for something light as a main replacement, found it too doughy towards the end6) Fillet 200g, New Zealand, grass fed (medium rare) -- perfection on a plate7) Sirloin 250g Rangers Valley, New South Wales, 300 days grain fed, Moroccan spice (medium rare) -- really good8) Grilled salmon, Sydney spiced, nicoise style: tomato, olives, egg, beans, anchovies -- well-spiced and very palatable, not overpowering9) Broccolini, hollandaise, toasted hazelnuts -- lightly blanced/ poached vegetables, not soggy and still crunchy10) Pear, blue cheese, walnut and rocket salad -- excellently complemented each other11) ‘Salt grill’ sorbet and ice cream selection -- great recommendation on the flavours by waitstaff (vanilla, maple and bay leaf)12) Mocha brulee, white chocolate ice cream, coffee meringue -- so so good13) 2010 Luke Mangan by TarraWarra Pinot Noir Yarra Valley VIC -- great choiceIt was a very enjoyable dinner and there wasn't too long a break between courses. I would recommend anyone to come at least once to dine here
3
Came here for the set lunch at $45++ for 2 courses. The views are very good, although probably better when it isn't raining. The limited set lunch menu is reasonable without being exceptional. I had the salmon tartare (which, interestingly was on the menu as "salmon tartar") as a starter while my wife had the liver pate. The salmon tartare was a little disappoinint and perhaps needed a little lemon or something to give it some more zest. The liver pate was very good, however. The Barramundi for main course was decent while the Moroccan chicken was fairly average. I had a glass of pinot and we didn't have dessert. Total bill came to $135 SGD for 2 people which was reasonable value for money given the views, but better value is available elsewhere if views aren't important

Being big foodies, I brought my husband to the Salt Grill for his birthday. From the impeccable food and lovely views to the service, our experience was so enjoyable we returned the following week for Father's day with family.We enjoyed the degustation menu without the paired wines and were completely satiated. The omelet with broth is particularly good with delicate flavors of miso and herbs, an experience not to be missed
4
Went it with high expectations and wasn't disappointed. Great location with views. Service was very professional and a step up from general Singapore standards. All our dishes were very enjoyable. Will be back bit not too often as it's pricey .

Previous reviews have clearly described the location of the restaurant. For a high level view of Singapore it really is stunning. We had a pretty good evening (wife's birthday). All the staff were fantastic and dealt with the minor issues during the course of the evening well which is a real positive. I'd initially opted for a WOW package where you pay an extra $90++ or so and receive a couple of drinks, a window table, a rose, a photo and a birthday cake (along with a 10% discount voucher I think for subsequent visits). Unfortunately there wasn't a gluten free cake option (it was a birthday meal for my wife who is allergic to wheat and gluten) so it didn't seem right to have a birthday cake presented to her that she couldn't eat. No big drama as it would have been pretty exceptional if they did offer a gluten free alternative. To be honest I only half expected it as we recently spent a week in Sydney and were very pleased to find that many places offer gluten free alternatives (to bread, pizzas, dessets etc). Saying that they rustled up some gluten free bread for my wife which was great. Thank you.Anyhow not a big thing so we opted for a regular booking. We arrived early and parked using the valet parking at ION (car park was pretty full). NB we were advised that we had to pick up our car by 10.30pm by the valet parking. Something to think about if you intend to drive there.So we sat at the bar, ordered a couple of drinks and took in the views. The wrong drink came out for me which was acknowledged and replaced with the one I ordered. They left the 'wrong' drink for us to have on the house which was nice.Our table was soon ready and so we were led to our table and the staff kindly offered to bring our drinks over to us. Mine arrived after a while. You know that feeling when you check into a hotel and wait for someone to bring your small suitcase up to you. Which you could have taken yourself quite easily but good hospitality means it has to be brought to you.Anyway my wife's hadn't come after some time. So we asked for it to be brought over (I think it may have been poured out - a 90% full gin and tonic might have looked like water perhaps).We gave our orders, asked for some water and my wife ordered wine for the meal. The gin and tonic came (a different gin) so back it went (unfortunately my wife wasn't keen on the 'wrong gin'). We ordered the scallops and the crab omelette to start. Scallops were excellent and although the crab omelette (with miso dressing I think) was executed perfectly, it wasn't something I would personally order again. Like I said really well made but it was an omelette. The gin and tonic arrived but a little late for my wife as she was into wine / meal now. Never mind. Main courses were very good - barramundi (consumed a lot on our recent trip to Sydney) was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Steak was excellent. Truffle oil fries were good (perhaps too much oil). The side order of pear, rocket, walnut and blue cheese was fine but the rocket was just too peppery for me (bitter side for my palate). No room left for dessert (not many gluten free options - my wife is the one with the sweet tooth). But a scoop of sorbet with a candle in it came out which was a nice gesture. Thank you.So all in all a pretty good dining experience.We also had a bit of fun with the sommelier as they have an option tin the wine list o choose a mystery wine (by the glass) and if you can tell the variety of grape or the country / region the glass is complementary. My wife got one right! Something light hearted but enjoyable

Even if you aren't celebrating a special occasion, your first SALT Grill experience will be an occasion. They have a large desk on the 4th floor of the Ion where your name is checked against the reservation list, and then you are shown into a dark room where your eyes make out the button of an elevator after they adjust to the dark. The dedicated elevator is only slightly lighter, and it takes you up to the 55th floor where you feel grateful to be once again in the light and the magnificent view of Singapore.We had a table for two at lunch on an overcast day, but we could see beyond Mt. Faber and Sentosa Island. We enjoyed every dish that we ordered: glazed figs with walnuts and capsicum appetizer; grilled barramundi, and truffle mash, a creamy mashed potato that had a lot of truffle oil in it. We would have liked the skin on the barramundi a bit softer, but aside from that, everything, from the reserved table to the service, to the food, was perfect. They have a good selection of wines, including wines by the glass. We also had a glass of Trinity voigner dessert wine that was delightfully sweet. The bill was expensive, of course, considering the venue and the added benefit of walking around the observation area after lunch, looking at familiar landmarks in Singapore. We have enjoyed Luke Mangan's specialty dishes in Australia and at the tapas restaurant in Raffles City. The view from the top of the Ion Orchard was just an added plus

Chose this place to be the celebration point for a birthday and went about making reservations and some planning.Joanne (hope I got the name right) from Concierge was a real joy to work with and she has been a really great help. Stepping past the level 4 Concierge, we are led into a dark area which was the private lift lobby. The ride up to level 55 of ION Orchard was silent, dim and the lift had quite a beautiful interface. Stepping out onto the restaurant, the reception brought us to our table. Having got the Wow Package, we had a nice window seat which offered a splendid view of the city. Watching the city is a different feeling from watching the view of the CBD or the areas around the waters of SG.Unfortunately, I am not able to appreciate the food as what I ordered differed from my expectations, and if you were used to having your salmon fully cooked, you might wish to mention that when you order their fish. However, I am sure that there were others on the menu that could have pleasured my taste buds if I had chosen my food correctly.Everything went well until the surprise part. If you're having a surprise here, do go through every details with them prior. The birthday cake was brought out early, much to MY surprise and the gift, stored at the reception and supposedly handed over to me, was not brought over. WIth the cake spoiling everything, and me having to ask for the gift, the whole surprise was a letdown, with only the view to make up the evening. The idea of offering two glasses of champagne was not wise and lacked of sincerity, especially when we were already having a bottle and two cocktails pending.Never one to write off an otherwise perfect place, I would gladly return for a quick dinner or perhaps just for drinks when I need a wonderful view of the city

We decided to have a drink here to see what the view was like from the top of ION. We were not disappointed. Although the drinks are expensive, to sit at the top of this amazing building was very relaxing and enjoyable. Don't think I would eat there, as to get a seat near the window is never guaranteed. And I found the large open space not very intimate

The menu is different to many in Singapore, encompassing both Asian and Western food at each course. The views of Singapore are absolutely stunning, the service wonderful and the decor pleasant and modern. The entrance, once out the lift, is a little off-putting as its very dimly lit and dark stone...once I felt my way in it was fabulous but I'm unsure what hiding the entrance was supposed to do to the prospective customers! Everything else was as good as it gets which is reflected in the prices ( Western style!)

When we were checked in by the receptionist and were led to the private lifts, we anticipated good ambience, good food, good service. However when the lifts door opened at the 55 floor, planks of wood and construction workers greeted our eyes. Apparently there are some renovation works. We walked past unsightly scenes of 4 or 5 staff chatting as we reach the entrance and was led to our table. Ambience was slightly rescued by the view which was great. You can even walk up a slight ramp to the bar counters at another level and have a go with a free binoculars station along the way.However destruction of our opinion continued with a sour face waiter who waited on us. We requested for another and was served by a great waitress who was attentive. Service was fast enough, maybe due to the fact that if you go earlier the restaurant has not filled up yet.Food was ok but we were slightly disappointed as it did not meet our expectations. We thought we saw a guest in slippers and shorts when we thought the dress code was smart casual? hmm.Come here if you want a great view and are not fussy about the service, food or the price of the food

Singapore can be very hit and miss with high-end restaurants and during the past 3+ years we have had more misses than hits. Salt is definitely a hit: great menu, good wines and an A+ setting, but a number of issues keep this from being a five star review. Service on arrival was excellent and after a great pre-dinner drink (at the rather underwhelming bar) we were pleased to be seated at a window seat. Others have mentioned that the tables are a little close together, but when tables with a view are at such a premium I don't blame a restaurant for making the most of it. We ordered the tasting menu with wine pairings. Service during the ordering was a little sullen and not in keeping with the otherwise friendly staff. The food was good. There were some stand-out dishes (crab omelette with broth, white onion soup and the (oh-so-good) beef) and some were just OK (kingfish sashimi and barramundi underwhelmed), but overall the ups far outweighed the downs.However, service for the early courses was lightning quick – to the point that we had to ask for the courses to be slowed. The service on the amuse bouche (served in an espresso cup and saucer) was so fast that the saucer was removed whilst my wife was drinking from the cup! The machine-gunning of the appetizers rather detracted from what should have been an elegant dinner and gave the impression that we were just a table to be turned – not what you want to feel on a special occasion (and at SGD 600+ for two). The table-service generally was at odds with the service that came before it, which had been warm, professional and classy.The wine pairings were of a good quality and really were well-matched, but with dishes coming and going so quickly, there was very little time before the next dish and the next glass of wine arrived. We are not slow drinkers by any stretch (honestly, probably the opposite) but at one point we were triple-parked. The waiter could not fail to have noticed, but no action was taken to slow the courses until we asked.In summary, we had a great time: a memorable meal with classy, interesting wine. But at a restaurant like this you expect rather more nuanced, intelligent service, and maybe even a smile

I had dinner last 14 September, Saturday. Made my reservation through reserveit, but I made a mistake by having a reservation at the bar instead of the dining room. I called them last minute requesting my reservation to be moved to the Dining Area, which has welcomly address and I was surprise that my Window Seat request was still acknowledge. That was a very nice move :) throughout the meal, the service was so attentive without being intrusive, the staff allLooks professional. I didnt feel being rush even though we ordered food late as we are all busy talking to each other. The Ambience was the icing of the cake. Chandeliers are fabulous. View is amazing. Food is also very tasty and flavours are well balance. I might only suggest to lessen the appetizer portions as it gets too filling and might leave less space for your mains. I ordered the pan seared scallops and i was served 3 big scallops. Maybe it was meant for sharing (for Asian Custom). The 3 ways pork for main was fantastic. Perfect sizes and very juicy. :) They have a minimum spending per person($60), maybe you can share appetizers (range from $28-35) and mains range from ($65-72). But it was worth it. The only bad thing was the receptions at the 4th floor didnt guide us where the lift is, as it is hidden behind a curtain. And was very dark

From the moment you walk in and get the vast view of singapore it is just WOW.First you enter the secret lift which is darkened adn vlue and arrive at the 55, you then enter into the main dinning room with a view to die for ( love to be there in a thunderstorm ) Wait staff are friendly nd attentive with out being pushy.We had the banquet lunch where you chose a starte and main . Oneof the specials that day was the shashimi of kingfish with ginger eschalot and goats cheese with pretty purple flowers on it ( left you wanting more ) . I followed this with the char grilled red drum , preserved lemon, green beans, tomato caper parsley burnt butter( yum)Cosmpolitan was great and the wine brilliant .Would love to go there again

We have eaten at several of Luke's restaurants and this one exceptional as it had the great service, food and a view to die for, 55 floors up.
Not to be missed for that special occasion or just for the sake of it...

I went with a guest to the bar, I must admit it was a bit of a let down. Whilst the atmosphere and views and great - most of the window view is taken up by a walkway which curves around to the bar. The bar itself is 'limited' and not that cool at all - there are no real views and you end up looking over the dining room. Not great!The service is so-so, with one bar man serving the bar tables. We ordered a couple of round of drinks and a cheese plateau and everything was fine except the fact that the cheese dish didn't arrive. After asking the manager, they reacted quickly but he didn't come back to apologise at all. Sums the service up overall.When the bill came, the tried to charge for the cheese dish - so I ask for it to be deducted from the bill which they duly honoured.Overall a mixed result!

Being Australian we decided to give Luke Mangan's restaurant a go and we weren't disappointed. The food had great flavours, was fresh and being seated right next to the window of Level 56 we had fantastic night views of Singapore.Worth the time to go and have a cocktail, some great food, wine or beer (as we know how expensive wine can be in Singapore) and enjoy the view and the atmosphere. The staff and service was also exceptional.Well done Luke

We began our marriage in Singapore in Aug '73 and returned for our fortieth this year. The Sky Bar was recommended from the Singapore Info Centre, once we had outlined our intent for the visit... a very special night out. We had a wonderful evening, enhanced by the maître d whom took us personally under his wing. A warm thank you to 'A' for enhancing our special event and ensuring a very memorable occasion. Wonderful service & presentation, timely delivery coupled with an awesome sunset. Best ever

Salt is at the top of the Orchard Ion building. The bar has a great view but is a little bit small, and is a little understaffed, so if you are in a bigger group it can take a while to get the drinks brought over. However, there is a good choice on offer. The food in the rstaurant is very good. Steaks and fish make up the majority of the main courses, and there is quite an interesting choice of tapas or starters. The service is not rushed so if you are prepared for a sociable leisurely meal this would work for you. I have eaten there on a few occasions, either as a couple or as a group of 8 friends and family and it works for both. Great setting and view, food very good, would recommend. Mind yiu at midnight and after a glass of wine or two it can be a challenge figuring out how to get out of the shopping mall!

For full review and pictures: www.GrumblingStomachs.wordpress.comAfter ordering, we were given a slammer to tease our appetite a little. It was interesting, quite sour but still interesting. First up were my appetizers! There were scallops, which was typical of any other restaurants. Their salted cod croquettes were outstanding. Served with homemade lemon mayo and tartar, the presentation was lovely and I finished them too fast!My main, grilled salmon, was extremely disappointing mostly because the cod tasted so good and I thought food here was going to impress me. The last time I had good salmon was probably at Morton’s Steakhouse. From what I remember, it was crispy on the outside and served with some lemon (?) sauce. The salmon here tasted too… average.BUT! HERE COMES DESSERT!This is the Chocolate Threeway, made up of (from left) a molten lava cake, a chocolate bar, and a ball o’ oreo. Two words: simply delicious. Must try. The ball o’ oreo was rather intriguing. It is made up of oreo powder on the outside and cream on the inside. I thought I tasted a little bit of dark chocolate too. Molten lava cake was great, but then again I’m not very picky when it comes to lava cakes.In the background, you’ll see a creme brûlée. Topped with a thin layer of caramel, it was a satisfying dessert but I much preferred my Threeway!I had a good dinner overall, but I wasn’t too happy that I paid an extra $20 for a view that really wasn’t that impressive. I also didn’t enjoy my main very much as compared to my dessert. The bill was reasonable, given that this is a fine dining restaurant, and the service was good.For full review and pictures: www.GrumblingStomachs.wordpress.co

Sat at a table for two near the window panels. Was surprised how close the tables were. I could hear the conversations from the next table. Ordered executive set lunch for two. Around $50 for entree and mains. It was very reasonably priced for an otherwise expensive ala carte menu around $70-80 per main. Entree was a salmon sashimi dish. First bite was too salty due to uneven seasoning. Otherwise, it was an ok sashimi dish. My partner had an omelette with crab meat that reminded me of the taste of dried oysters. For mains, I had a fish with long beans. I would have preferred asparagus instead of long beans. Honestly, nothing special about this dish. Something that my MIL cooks at home every other day and I regretted ordering it. My partner had steak. It was unevenly cooked and lack the juiciness of a medium rare steak.The best servings were the sides we ordered - fries and mushrooms. The mushrooms were juciy and delicious. Serving was generous. Fries were crispy and evenly seasoned.It is a nice place to bring a date but find the food not up to the standards of what they are charging. For an executive lunch, it is ok. But I won't be back for dinner if this is the quality of food they are serving for lunch.

We had a table of 10 (all Aussies) to celebrate a special occasion. We decided on the set meal which I have to say was lovely. The food was delicious and presentation was exactly what you would expect from a world class restaurantThe service was very good, ambience was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed our experienceThe view from our table was amazing looking over Singapore, would definitely recommend this restaurant for any occasion especially a special event!Well done

My second visit - first for dinner - affirmed my belief that this is one of the best dining experiences in Singapore. The views are stunning, the service informed and attentive, the portions generous and the flavors sublime. Go easy on the tapas if you want to do justice to the main course - two tapas for two is just right. Try to keep place for some dessert - they let you share.The only disappointment was the bar. We got there about 20 minutes ahead of time and got tucked away into this left of centre table with a nothing-by-nothing view. The walk up ramp could have accommodated a few tables - dunno. But it was not much of a dampner fortunately. The wine list kinda made up for the lack of a view too.

My husband and I tried the executive lunch to celebrate his birthday. The view was great and I am pleased we paid the extra $20 to secure a window seat. The setting and service was good and the food first rate. To start, we had the salad of butter lettuce with shaved onions, roast walnuts and Roquefort (I really liked the grated blue cheese) plus the chargrilled chorizo, red pepper salsa and fresh buffalo mozzarella.For our main course we had the penne pasta with almond pesto, parmesan and feta (this was very good and we will try something similar at home) and the beef tenderloin. Finally we managed to squeeze in the hazelnut cake with burnt butter ice cream for dessert which was delicious.I would recommend this restaurant for special occasions as it is expensive but on the occasion we visited, it was worth it for the quality of the food and the great view

My partner and I decided treat ourselves to a dinner at Salt on the second last night of our stay in Singapore. There was a warm welcome on arrival and we were promptly ushered to our table. We weren’t too bothered about a window table on this day due to the awful haziness caused by the Indonesian fires – we went there for the food really. We were approached three times within the first five minutes of sitting down. Firstly to be offered the menu by our waitress (a rather charming Eastern European lady) and she took our water order, then a second time by another waitress to ask if we wanted water (it’s been ordered already thanks), we were then promptly served our water and bread and approached to take our order. Luckily we had already decided to go with the tasting menu and the matching wine option, so we were ready to order. By this stage we felt like we needed a breather from the staff, but before we could blink our amuse bouche had arrived…give us a break – we haven’t even washed our hands yet! Once the amuse was cleared our first course was promptly served, as was each course that followed - all delicious. The wine equally good, I was amazed at how some of the wine choices worked with the food, one thing I would have liked was the sommelier to explain the why the wine matched the dish- a service that I expect from fine dining establishments. Our charming waitress allowed me to order an alternate dessert, as I am not a huge fan of lemon tart. She recommended the hazelnut cake, so I went for it – it was sublime, the only downfall was a short black hair that was hiding under my last bit of cake, which I noticed as I took my last bite…it was a disappointing sight. Our waitress was very apologetic and offered us each a comp small glass of dessert wine. It didn’t make up for it though, this just shouldn’t happen when you are spending over $500 on a meal for two. We then went to the Sky bar and treated ourselves to 3 cocktails each, a further $120. We enjoyed our night, but felt that the service could be a little less rushed. We were served by about five different people during the meal, so overall we felt that the service was a little impersonal. We will however consider a second visit in the future

I was at Salt with two other friends and we had a nice table next to the windows. The servers were very attentive and they obviously know their menu well. The restaurant itself is lovely and we all had a good night view of the town. The tables were spaced nicely so you dont feel you are too close to the next table.We ordered the oysters and the sashimi of kingfish and gota cheese and it was indeed sweet and delicious. I also enjoyed my beef steak which was done just nicely. The dessert was however, alittle sweet for our taste.We all had a very good time and I will definitely go back to Salt again

When I stepped into Salt, it looks like a place where Angelina Jolie as Agent Salt might rendezvous with James Bond. That view and the skywalk would be worth twenty bucks right there. But apparently the management spent all its funds on rent and decor leaving the food, drinks and service to bitter disappointment. When our party of 12 or so arrived for drinks on the top level, the staff took its time to take the orders. No one else was even there at the time. 15 minutes passed and many of our drinks had not arrived--such as hard-to-mix drinks like beer and red wine (not served in the same glasses, thankfully). We couldn't quite figure out why a host in a sharp black suit would then start to push us to move to the dining area when at least 4 of us still had not gotten our drinks while others were shamed out of ordering a second round. Yes, I understand there are other patrons arriving, but we were about to plunk down a couple grand there, and we were just--hold on, customers--so a bit more courtesy might be in order.We were not the type of group who behaved badly or spoke loudly; I bet the Salt manager probably doesn't even remember us because we're just a boring group of folks having a farewell dinner for a colleague. At this point, we were still in cheerful spirits. We each ordered the set menu, which is three courses at S$105 ++. The restaurant waitress appeared very confused despite this apparently simple arrangement because, after all, there were choices for the appetitzer and main courses. She even dared to interrupt a deep conversation to ask for the order, as if the kitchen was closing even though we were among the first few tables seated. Waitress from Mel's Diner might have been more polite.Well, maybe the bar host (I still remember his evil stare--he even looked like a thinner Dr. Evil sans the eye patch, silver suit and Mini Me) and the waitress were having bad days. But, it seems like the chef was taking the day off too. The tuna tartar I had was all right; I've had much better. The salad seemed like leftovers from a Sizzler on a Sunday afternoon. As for the fries, they were... uh... just fries. On to the main course between beef or salmon. For me, I prefer beef in most cases but at fine restaurants I always choose the fish. Besides, I was hoping they spent S$5 on the appetitzer and fries and the rest of the S$100 on the grilled salmon. Alas, it was not to be. The chef chose to leave the skin on, which was a mistake. I've had fish with grilled skin where it's crispy and tasty. This was not one of those cases. Like everyone else, I peeled off the fish skin, and placed it on the bread dish (forgot about the weird bread... but I have no time to go there). Because we were sharing salads, I had put some salad in my dish as well and later mistakenly ate a bit of fish skin. Seriously, I do not remember the last time I had to spit food out at a restaurant. It was awful.I had high hopes for the Salt Grill & Sky Bar. Starting with the cocktail I ordered, the Singapore Sling, being not even half as tasty as you can have for free in Economy on Singapore Airlines, to the plain salad, fries, then to the weird bread and bad fish, and finished off with ordinary sorbet and coffee, I must say the Salt is consistent: consistently bad. I don't even think it was a matter of high expectations. My colleagues were confused about how it could have been an experience so awful that it may overwhelm our celebratory occassion. Well, it didn't quite do that. We still had a good time among friends and colleagues and made no bitter complaints or scene. I suppose it's easy to be charmed by the spectular surroundings to overlook the sub-par food and service. The colleagues were not so kind next day around the water cooler.The Salt is flashy, with a great view, great decor and great atmosphere. The food might be fine if you paid $30 for it, but for a hundred bucks, it's a crime. Finally, Dr. Evil and his team should return to its criminal ways (maybe this is it!). Either way, I doubt the our office will be having spending thousands of dollars there again

I attended for a sit down function for 60 people ( company booked the whole restaurant) and really enjoyed the location, meal and service. The views are outstanding and the degustation meal was excellent throughout the night. The staff were professional and attentive at all times
5
We wanted to celebrate a birthday, to make it special + it was. The staff were genuine, warm + friendly. We had a window seat + savoured the wonderful night views across Singapore. There were people all around us yet they didn't seem to intrude. The menu was extensive + well balanced, as was the wine selection. Our maitre'd was knowledgeable, had a great sense of humour (well he got ours) + any slight changes to the menu were no problem at all. The meals we ordered were well portioned, visually pleasing + full of flavour - all the elements worked well together. Before we knew it 3 hours had passed by, a great sign by any measure + yes we would come back
5
One of the best meals I have ever enjoyed. Service was outstanding from Alasdair. The view is jaw-dropping. The food was amazing - highlights included the scallops, pork, and extensive well-selected wine list. I cannot praise this fine dining experience too much - it was amazing
5
I love a restaurant with a view, usually i find these tend to disappoint on the food side of things. Salt Grill is an exception to these findings, We started with a glass of Champagne as we were celebration our engagement here which is good and not often available at the top end restaurants.The food was fantastic, I had steak and chips, cooked rare, and it was just as I wanted.The service was excellent, we were brought the wrong starter, (not delivered by the person who took the order) the waiter who took the order noticed very quickly and took the food back without hesitation and apologised sincerely for the error - even though I wasn't too bothered.The only think that could have been improved would be the cleanliness of the glass outside - which I cant really blame the restaurant for, more a fault of Ion Orchids buildings services.I would recommend this dining experience to anyone visiting or living in Singapore. You won't forget it
5
I have been a couple of times at Salt, incl once for a birthday, and once on an event evening incl dinner and wine arrangement. The atmosphere is great, gorgeous view, spacious table setting, well versed waiters and certainly in these special occasions they really make you feel a special guest.We will definitely come back to celebrate or just enjoy a great evening out
3
Rather disappointed as following shopping in the Ion we thought a beer and possibly a light bite would be nice so went up to the Salt Bar & Grill only to be told on arrival on the 55th floor that service was over and the bar (and grill) were closed. Really most places can run a bar though out the day so this was a surprise and a disappointment. We were allowed to take some photos though which I attach and certainly the view is stunning. I looked at the menu - it was Ok but nothing special to my eye. Also the place seemed rather small but maybe I only saw a small part of it.Come on guys get serious and if it is a bar then surely it should be open during the afternoon

Made an online reservation for my wife and I at the Salt Grill last weekend. Reservation was well handled. Requested for a window table. Arrived on time, were whisked up in a private elevator from the 4th floor up to the 55th floor. This was a nice touch. Arrived at the restaurant. Got us a table with a great view. I had seen the menu online and knew what to expect. The service was good, the waiters were helpful. They were nearby but yet kept their distance. The lighting was a bit poor but I suppose this was done purposely to create the mood. The food was fine, not outstanding. The best part for me was the view and the dessert!. The bill was a tad over what I would have like to have paid but I suppose the venue was excellent. In summary, good for an occasion, don't expect spectacular food and unlikely to be a regular for me
4
found this place by accident. being australian i have heard of but haven't tried his food. it was superb, all the chefs recommendation were divine. the view was fantastic and the ambience very relaxing.staff was very attentive, the dirty martini is a royal thumbs up
5
Spent 5 days working in Singapore and had a function here for lunch on the last day. I wish I had found it earlier. The coffe here was the best I had while in Singapore. I will be back
4
Me and my wife were here on our anniversary and can't fault a thing.We're not big on the whole fine dining thing but this really was fantastic.I ordered the chorizo to start and my wife the salt cod croquettes, both of which were superb.For the main course I had a sirloin steak and my wife chose the snapper with a capsicum sauce, we were very happy with both.By this time we were quite satisfied but thought we would share a dessert, we opted for the hazelnut cake with salted caramel, it was sweet, salty, nutty, and we even considered ordering 1 more but we chose against it as we had prior engagements.All in all an excellent meal, expensive but quite worth the cost
5
The restaurant is more charming for dinner than for lunch. If you would like to enjoy spectacular views of Singapore, get there for lunch or just for early dinner, before dawn is best!Night time is also,very charming place for dinner, high up on 55th floor, city lights outside and night classic looking lamps with soft red lighting inside, making the place good venue for a quite dinner with your couple or friends in small group.When you book make sure you ask for a window table. Most tables are by the window but some small ones for two people are not. They also,have a space reserved for big celebrations where they fit a long table for 20 people or so. However with no direct view outside.Food is really good, very tasty, well cooked and portions are not as terribly small as at other places in Singapore. Meat is greatly cooked and tender, fish is fresh, and desserts are tasty.The service at this place is, so far, over the Singapore standard and this is a great feeling for a change. You are treated very kindly, with care and the personnel is at your disposal; it is a great surprise, because some other similarly expensive restaurants do not have staff that genuinely care as the staff do at this restaurant. It makes you feel like going back.The wine list is where I can give the restaurant a minus,... Probably wines are great, and the one we ordered was, at 120 dollars the bottle... But it was one of the cheapest, with prices going on a very steep up curve into the three hundreds and six hundreds,... And more. I hope my very nice Chilean wine at 120 dollars the bottle stays in the menu for long! A very nice venue for celebrating something special
3
We popped up for a quick lunch while shopping at Ion and ordered brunch items and a tapas dish. The tapas arrived 25 minutes after the rest of the dishes due to problems in the kitchen. The waiting staff apologized twice but should have really removed it from our bill. Red wine was served at around 4 degrees which was disappointing. Food was reasonably good but the whole experience was not top drawer at all
4
The whole experience was wonderful.Made reservations via Reserveit.sg with some inquiries. By noon, I got an email, then a call from Suzana to confirm my reservations and requirements as it was a special occasion.On the day itself, the staff called to remind the reservations. The experience from the reception to the restuarant took about 5-10mins. We were asked to go into a mini art gallery which led us to a very dark lift lobby. It was so dark that one could totally not see the lift except for some floor lights. It felt like space. Me n partner were alone there and it felt so magical. We thought that if we were alone in the lift during the ride up, it would have been great. The lift was also dark and magical. Reminded me of the Charlie and Chocolate factory story.We were ushered to our seats quickly and I got a table by the window which gave us unblocked view of Keppel Bay. It was dark and we could not really see anything though. There were alot of caucasian and filipino staff, but they were all very friendly and knowledgable. One caucasian lady staff spontaneously introduced the menu and recommendations.We had Scallops with black pudding and entree portion of Potato gnoochi with parmesan etc.Main was the Crispy skinned salmon, king prawn(x2) which we shared. All 3 dishes were great! The scallops had no fishy taste/smell, the gnoochi tasted so good with the truffle oil n parmesan. Good mixDesert was the chocolate souffle with mint icecream. The icecream was good and thick. The souffle was a little too sweet on the inside and too wet. I felt a little overdose of chocolate after 3mouths. Both of us couldnt finish the souffle.Inclusive of San pellegrino (?? spelling) gst n svc charge, bill was 207. Svc throughout was good, attentive. My partner who is very particular about FEEL, loved the place for her ambiance. It's a great place to bring someone for a romantic dinner. We had the whole elevator to ourselves on the way down. It was wonderful. You need to be inside to know
4
personally I think that this place has one of the best dining experience's in singapore! the great view's with the even greater food that they serve, make it a must! we've been a few times for sunday brunch and chosen the a la carte and brunch menus. the brunch portions are modest in size but full of flavor - but if you're hungary you will need a side, so why not the truffle fries or mushrooms! the deserts are delicious - the creme brulee or 'chocolate three ways' both recommended. The staff are pleasant and try, but for the type of (high end) establishment need to be better and slicker (hence not the top score). but overall, our recommendation is go, go, go
5
3 of us had the $45++ Executive Lunch option which had around 4 choices of starter and 4 choices of main course. All of us enjoyed each dish immensely. Delicate favours, beautiful presentation and well timed service. The skyline view of Orchard Road and surrounds was fantastic. Definitely worth a visit
4
If you need some exciting impression this place is very convinient as its location. You will have a feeling as if you live in the clouds above the city. Food is nice and creative. Wine list is wide enough. Service is good. You need to book in advance. And I definitely recommend to book a table near the window
5
I was there for lunch during Restaurant Week so we were warned that we only had 1hr15mins to finish our food, but they didn't shoo us out. The minute we walked in, it was clear that no matter how the food turned out, the view was so worth the admission price. We had a table by the floor-to-ceiling window, so we were mostly gawping at the view. Thankfully the food did not disappoint.My friend's omelette with crab and miso broth was delightful (I had a bite), but not something I would order for myself because I can probably make it at home. The chicken liver parfait with toasted brioche and truffled butter was really good, the brioche a little too sweet for my taste but a really well executed dish. I used the bread served on the side to finish the liver parfait, which was served in a cute mason jar. The beef tenderloin was perfectly cooked to a medium rare as requested, well-seasoned, and the pressed potato layered with blue cheese on the side was tasty. I wished it had more blue cheese flavor to it though. The red wine jus complemented the beef well. I didn't like the texture of the pureed celeriac root, it was too baby food-ish for me. I would have liked it more if it was lumpier, perhaps coarsely chopped. My friend had the floating island with Frangelico for dessert; it was a foamy, frothy thing surrounded with berries. It first bite it was light and creamy, then a burst of sugar hits you hard. The dessert sampler plate I had was excellent. The first item was a creme brulee topped with crispy pellets of chocolate and salted caramel ice cream. The creme brulee has vanilla seeds in it, very light and tasty, and the salted caramel ice cream had a really pronounced salt flavor. The salt really enhanced the caramel flavor. The second item was a bar of dark chocolate, mixed with crispy nutty crackly things, it was so delicious and was my favorite of the bunch. The third item was very inventive: licorice ice cream (love!!!) with citrus-flavored sago pearls. I love licorice in any form so I really enjoyed that.The coffee was surprisingly strong and good, much better than a lot of "specialist" coffee shops. The milk was also served warm and frothed on the side, so that was a major plus.Service was attentive if a little haughty and cold.I'm already planning to return for Restaurant Week next year

The service is good, they are attentive to their customers. Steak is great! Personally, I would loved to visit the restaurant again!

Exceptional atmosphere, classic and feel like you are really looked after by great staff. Food was great too! Portions the right size and flavors were outstanding.... We will return!If you struggle to get good quality food, cooked well in a mature and almost classic atmosphere then this is the place to come!Thank you

I brought my boyfriend here to celebrate his birthday. Reservation were prompt, though my request for a cake can't be done because i need to order it 2 day in advance but i was told to order a dessert instead (They will draw a happy birthday word on it)The place was a little hard to find if you have totally no clue where is it BUT, by following the signs once you exit from Orchard MRT to Ion, it is very easy actually. Take the lift up to the 4th floor and on your left is a huge wooden desk and the counter is right there. The lift experience up to 55th floor was amazing! :) I love the lift ride.Upon exiting the lift, we were greeted by the hostess and were led to our seats promptly. Unfortunately, we were not given a window seat but it's okay, the whole atmosphere up there is still awesome!We order 2 mains, 1 appetizer, 1 Mojito and 1 Creme Brulee for the whole dinner. (i forget what we ordered exactly, but it was salmon, steak and fries. All 4 food items are awesome! The combination they had for each food item was excellent! The Creme Brulee was not too sweet but yet preserve the same texture and flavor!The Creme brulee was supposed to be the surprise for him BUT, the staff place the bowl on the table a tad too hard and loud behind us on their bar counter and that caught my boyfriend's attention and thus the surprise was spoilt cause he saw the candle on it!Other than exposed surprise, It was an excellent dinner paired with great service! :) Would recommend couples and maybe family to dine in here

FoodFor tapas and appetizers, we shared the salt and pepper squid and egg omelette with crabmeat.The squid was average but the omelette was spectacular with a really good broth. For mains, the veal with foie gras was a little too heavy for my liking. The flavor of the veal was nice but the meat was a little tougher than I expected. My friend who had the blue fin tuna absolutely loved it as did my friend who had the steak. Desserts were all great and I would recommend the chocolate done 3 ways.ServiceFirstly, my friend had not realized that they had a minimum spend of $60 per person when they booked it. So, when another friend came along just for drinks and not food, there was a little bit of quibbling on her needing to at least order some food, an appetizer or something. We ended up having to insist that we'd surely exceed $300 for the bill of 5 anyway, even if only 4 were eating. We surely did, ended up spending about $550! But that already left a bad taste in our mouths.Then, when we needed to pay the bill and wanted it to be split by 4 credit cards, the server insisted that he could at most only do it for 2 cards. This was ridiculous! All we asked was for an equal split. I've been to cheaper restaurants where they're even nice enough to split according to what we eat for a larger no. of people. Final verdict: The food might be good but after such appalling service, neither I nor any of my friends will return and we will not recommend this restaurant to anyone else

Thought we would enjoy a great dining experience for our last night in Singapore, and booked for dinner for two at 8.00 PM.Normally, I like a refresher for starters and asked for a Lemon, Lime & Bitters. After two attempts at A Bitter Lemon drink, we finally resolved Salt were unable to supply a somewhat quintessential pre dinner drink.We opted for the degustation menu, wine portions were very small, although the meal was quite good. We had to send the waiter back to secure steak knives as they were not available for the beef dish.In the restaurant, there was a broken chair, my seat wobbled, and it was clear the carpet needed a decent shampoo. Normally, I would accept this level of service at my local hotel, however for $600 for dinner for two I think, Lemon Lime & Btters, a steak knife with my meal, and a steady seat are not unreasonable. Would like to recommend this place, but at this stage really wished I had headed to Little India for great curry

Went in early September 2012 and was very impressed. The Oysters to start incredibly fresh, and I've eaten a lot of high quality seafood in South Australia. The Duck Sliders were a highlight. On my first occasion ( I was back 3 weeks later on return to Singapore) I had a steak off the girl, medium rare which was ever so slightly underdone, but nonetheless very tasty, made even better by the Parmesan and truffle oil French fries, which are amazing. On my second visit I had the pork belly as my main which had 3 very god sized portions, much bigger than I expected, and it melted in my mouth. The best I've ever had, without doubt. Oysters were not available on that occasion so the sashimi king fish was our starter, and that was Devine. The view and service exceptional. We had incorrectly booked our second visit the night after we'd left Singapore without realising until we arrived at the lift. We were informed we could have tapas at the bade but there was no tables available. They obviously checked their records whilst we were in the lift, seen wed Ben there not 3 weeks ago and were greeted at the lift by our waitress from the first occasion who took us to a table that had been specially prepared for us as we travelled in the lift. That is service you just can't get anywhere these days. Will definitely go again.

Having read some widely varied reviews about Luke Mangan's "SALT GRILL & SKY BAR", we wanted to experience it first hand...the view is quite stunning, as is the ride in the express elevator to the 55th Floor of "ION Orchard". The service was excellent (especially Alvin), the wine list absolutely perfect and the food was superb...we both had steaks which were grilled to perfection. A great meal in a 5+ star setting...a tad on the pricey side but worth it...if our experience is anything like "normal", than this restaurant deserves will start to climb in Singapore's rankings

If you're a travelling through Singapore and you're looking for a "fine" fine dining experience, I doubt you'll find one better done than this. From the lobby on the 4th floor of Ion, all the way to your seat on the 55th floor, it's a special and intimate experience. You'll also get a truly amazing view of Singapore. All the dishes we had relied on fresh, high-quality ingredients with minimum interference by the kitchen. No sauces or trickery, but where they did require dressing it was done with a light hand and the flavours were exciting and enhanced, rather than hid, the ingredients in the dish.Price-wise, they occupy premium penthouse floorspace in one of Singapore's most desirable shopping locations and they have their own private elevators, so you know what to expect. Some of the markup was a bit eye-popping ($135++ for a bottle of Cape Mentelle Shiraz, $125++ for a bottle of Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc), so you will need to have deep pockets and a strong heart.But, if you have the budget, this is a dining location that will leave you with a lovely memory of Singapore

1st - The elevator (lift) is interesting. Feel like it take you on a cloudy journey to the sky dining.2nd - The view from the top make you want to stay there forever.3rd - The ambience and the mood was just awesome! On the food, there is nothing much to shout about but it was up to my expectation with the kind of price you would pay. The service was alright. I can tell, the staff tried hard to serve. Perhaps a little bit more training will be helpful

This is not so much a review but a request to the Owners and Managers I would like to get their feedback to the allegation(and I note there have been a number of submitted reviews as well as those I have heard verbally and my own expereince ) that the food portions are extremely small --I have no problem in paying top dollar but do expect to get a reasobale size portion I visited with agroup back in June and this was also my impression at the time (and the baiss for my scores in this review)--I was planning to go again but wanted to kow if things ahd improved for the bette

Delicious food and excellent service with a 360 degree view of Singapore. I particularly enjoyed the grilled spatchcock on celeriac puree. The Executive Lunch is good value.
2
not a wonderful food and atmospher i thought it would be with this price. so so food and atmosphere. the best thing there is when u travel in their elevator.
5
Enjoy 360 degree views of Singapore while eating wonderful food. Very attentive staff and lovely atmosphere.
3
Food ok, but nothing special. Booked table next to the window, did not get that. Then it doesn't really help to hear them say "i'm so sorry" when we arrive. Overall not worth it.
3
Fantastic view, probably the best among the roof-top restaurants in Singapore, so try to get a table by the window. The food is creative and overall, quite good (although certainly not in the 'outstanding' category). We tried a lot of the tapas and appetizers - some are excellent (eg. crab omelette; crusted quail breast, confit leg and jamon iberico); some are definitely a pass - forgettable, or better executed elsewhere (eg. steak tartare, duck sliders, tempura zucchini flowers or tempura oysters). Service and prices are two issues common with the high-end restaurant sector in Singapore these days: Because of the tight labor market, good waiters are rare; the ones here are attentive, but lack training, so are of NO use when it comes to recommendations or even explaining the dishes. Prices are in line with restaurants this calibre in Singapore, but because of the strong S$ you can get better value in New York, DC or California

We reached around 6+ for dinner and the sun was setting. It was a nice backdrop to the city view. The service was good, Herman was friendly and helpful. We ordered the sydney crab omelette, scotch medium well, tuna. He recommended the Pinot Noir which was to my likely, slight taste of spiciness, reminding me of Shiraz which is my favourite. The food was good, the scotch is perfectly done =) As it was our anniversary, Herman arranged a candled scoop of ice cream. We left around 8 where the place became crowded. For the better personalised experience, do come in earlier, less crowd and the sunset
2
We got the degustation menu matched with wine. When someone asked 'what is this?' on the food put down in front of them, the waiter replied 'the entree' the next question, but what actually is it? The waiter said I'll need to go to the kitchen to ask. The wine glasses were nearly always under-poured. It was a huge task for them to split the bill equally. I had been their before for lunch and enjoyed. I think the service is slipping and will never go again. There are a number of better restaurants you can to for SGD250 a head
4
I had dinner here with a big group, and despite the large group size (almost 40 people,) both the food & the service were very good. I wasa little disappointed in the starter (burrata cheese, but a tiny serving,) but my main course (barramundi, and Australian fish,) was quite nice, and dessert was inventive and tasty (a licorice ice cream with lime sauce -- sounds weird, but tasted good!) The view is lovely, and the restaurant even has a walkway around the perimeter so you can check out the fast developing skyline

I lunched here during Restaurant Week. The view was excellent, and service was attentive and polite. But the portions were tiny, even the mains. I asked to see the regular menu and asked if the portions were larger than Restaurant Week portions but was told they weren't. The house salad was excellent. The spatchcock was so-so and tiny, and so were the barramundi and salmon. Dessert was also not memorable. Maybe for Restaurant Week prices, you may be able to say it was reasonable. But to order the same things on the regular menu, you'd have to have very deep pockets. If the food were spectacular enough I might pay for that and the view; but I can't say this is the case for this restaurant. There are many other places where you can get better food in more realistic portions.

This place really has a view to kill.Came here for my birthday celebration with my wife. Given a seat right beside the window.You have to try the Glass Sydney Crab Omelette Appetizers. What a beautiful dish!Great steak! Had one done medium rare and the other rare. Turned out good. Topped it off with truffle mashed potato, which is also a highly recommended side.I will come back here again given the opportunity. Looking forward to trying out the sky bar

The food was very tasty . The portion is small look like French cuisine but so yummy.
Best view to see all Singapore was imazing . We enjoy it so much .
4
We had heard that this restaurant had great views but portions would be small. For a rooftop restaurant spun off from its Sydney base, I expected so-so food with a great view to make up for food quality (as the case is in many cities). We visited over lunch on restaurant week, and I was pleasantly surprised to find the Salt salad reasonably sized- a delectable green starter with a finely poached egg (this was the highlight). For the mains, a pan-fried barramundi textured in a way that Australian chefs do best. Dessert was ok, but not really memorable. Service was extremely attentive and top-rate. And the views from the 55th floor of Ion Orchard were breathtaking. I think we will be back

This poor restaurant must have majorly pissed off some reviewers to be only ranked 480, i hope they were fair criticisms, as i found nothing terribly wrong with the food or service. I got invited here by a friend who's been here 4-5 times, so obviously he and his family have found the food and service to be good enough. The location and view on the 55th floor in the orchard area was certainly good, and we had a window seat to fully appreciate it. We had the lunch set which was an appetiser and main for $40, which was ok. We had the omelette with miso soup which was 1 of their specials i believe, and although the omelette was ordinary, the presentation with miso soup was unusual and rather creative, and the taste was sightly improved. I had the spatchcock which was a rather smallish portion, but it was lunch and i am a small eater, so no complaints there. My friend had the salmon which also looked smallish but we found it cooked rather well, seared on the outside and just a tad soft inside. The wait staff also took care of my friend's 5 year old, making sure his water was not too hot or cold, and he also polished off the duck sliders. We had the petit fours for dessert which was ok. Overall, i think this restaurant is doing ok and shouldn't be ranked lower than McDonald's, it's just unrea

It was my third visit and probably my last for a long time. The venue is great, especially if you get a window table. But this is the only positive thing I can say without any hesitation. The portions come in sizes which are only a bit larger than amuse-bouches served at other restaurants. This is not molecular gastronomy but calls itself a "grill". I left hungry even after a 3-course meal. Worse was the service this time. We were attended in turns by the restaurant manager, Ms Juszkiewicz, and a waitress from China. The first was artificially over-polite, bordering on the fake, the second spoke poor English and needed to take down even small orders. In a restaurant like this you expect to be served by professional staff, not by part-time students-likes. On my previous visit we had an excellent waiter though, so there's no consistency in service. The bill was huge, expect at least $200 per head if you order drinks. It's not worth the money, really, for that you can have food of equal quality, larger portions and served with a genuine smile at many other restaurants. Give it a miss, you won't miss anything

I had previously enjoyed one of my favorite meals at Salt in Sydney. I was excited about eating at the sister property in Singapore. It turned out to be a massive disappointment. 1. The Food was not great, in my opinion just satisfactory, however given the prices charged...completely over priced and very far from value for money. 2. Our two tables (which were spending more than any other booking) were placed in an area with no view. This turned out to be a section with poor service (but maybe everyone had poor service this night?). We were pouring our own wine and water as the service was bad. Dirty plates and glasses remained on the table for 2--30 minutes even when the waiter walked past empty handed! The staff had no knowledge of the menu.3. The bathrooms have a great view but stank and had not been cleaned for many hours.4. We complained several times to no avail. 5. The Polish Manager and Head Waiter seemed powerless to correct any problems. We found out the Aussie Exec Chef was not around on one of the busiest nights if the year! (It was the Saturday of the 2012 F1 Grand Prix...I guess watching the race was more important than making sure the ffi was REAL SALT quality? Some of guests had a la carte and others the tasting menu, Meal service was not coordinated so we were all eating at different times???? An Aussie restaurant with NO Aussies in sight????6. The restaurant design left a lot to be desired. They have a huge ramp from the restaurant to the bar. I am not sure if this was building code or not, but because of it, we had NO view and i think another 30+ seats could be added. The ramp could be replaced by a set of stairs! The restaurant was not easy to find with very poor signs to guide you.I would definitely not recommend you visit this restaurant. It is only a very poor copy of the original. It is all about the view and not about the service. Try one of the other Celebrity Chefs at Marina Bay Plaza for a better experience.FYI, I am a hospitality professional so do understand how the business should be operated

We had dinner at The Salt Grill Restaurant on a weekday evening.The restaurant was fully booked when we called 5.00pm. The staff was helpful and called back half an hour later to say someone cancelled their booking, and asked if we were fine. Hence, we managed to get a table in the central dining hall.Upon reaching the restaurant, we walked our customary round on the upper viewing deck, to soak in the views. It was nice and tranquil, as there were only 3 other guests there.We then proceeded down for the dinner. The waitresses brought a basket for our bags, and were warm and helpful throughout the dinner. The breads were warm and crisp on the outside, soft on the inside. They go very well with the olive oil, and spices and nuts combination.We ordered a cocktail and a mocktail. The cocktail was good. However, the cranberry mocktail was too sweet and hardly have any taste of the fruit. The waitress exchanged a glass for us, upon feedback, which was slightly better than the first.We had the famous grilled quail appetizer, which was indeed very good. For the mains, we had a 300 days grain fed tenderloin and salmon and prawn, respectively.The tenderloin looked nice, but the meat texture was tougher than what we have eaten at Morton's. The salmon smelled a bit fishy, but tasted ok It was on the plain side.For desserts, we had the chief's souffle of the day. It was normal, and we were not used to the slightly sourish taste.All in all, it was a good dining experience with good ambience and service. However, the quality of food could be better

being the sky bar and grill for the new showcase mall in Singapore (Ion), diners will expect more than they will get from this establishment. The bar is somewhat small and squeezed in above the restaurant and doesn't offer any great vistas of Singapore but is adequate as a holding pen for diners. The restaurant does provide the majority of diners with reasonable views of Singapore which adds to the ambience. The menu is the usual fare of Australian / European / Asian cuisine fusion which can be found in many restaurants around town. Although not disappointing, the food did not have the "wow" factor expected of a top end restaurant. The wine list will suit all taste buds and wallets! Overall, this restaurant could be much more but leaves the diner wanting more
4
Salt is atop the Ion building on Orchard Rd, some might say a strange place for a top end restaurant, however it works and the view over Singapore is one f the better ones. We started our evening at the bar and the staff were exceptionally attentive catering to our needs well and offering valid suggestions. After which we headed to our window side table. We were effectively at the back of the restaurant, if you have a choice request the Marina Bay end as the view will be much better.Both of us went with the steak and it was cooked perfectly and presented well with sides coming at the same time, if you know Singapore restaurants sadly this is not always the case.Deserts were also perfectly presented. Try the wild berry strudel.Overall a very good restaurant and one of the better at this end of the dining experience. Recommended over most of the others sitting atop some of the high rise in Singapore.Staff were very good, decor as would be expected and pricing towards the high end. If I had one criticism, it would be the overt marketing of the owner with 'Luke' plastered all over the glasses and crockery, a little self centered for my liking but not offensive, Luke Mangan has done a great job with the menu and it is definitely a must go for business or a special treat
5
After all the comment I have read in review, it really take me sometime to consider spending my anniversary there. And we are glad that we have chosen the right choice. The experience start when we step out of the lift due to the decoration from level 4 is rather dim and when the lift open in front of you the city view. As we were early for the reservation, so we decided to have a drink at the bar. Watching the unblock the sun set in an airconditioning place... thumbs up. Finally we settled down at the table, order our food. No complain for the taste and flavor, service staff was attentive, nothing goes wrong for the meal. Everything is just as I wish.. We enjoyed our dinner and will certainly be going back to dine again.

unlike most of the other restaurant on the top floor, this one isnt over-looking at the CBD but oversees the major shopping street, Orchard Road.
Food was delicious and service was just lovely.

I was amazed when I read some of the earlier reviews, because I've had nothing but great times at Salt. I live in Singapore, and have visited the restaurant 8 times during the last 3 months, so feel fairly qualified to review it. Firstly, the staff are the same, week in, week out. They know the food, are unobtrusive, remember you, and are very welcoming.. In the case of Anya, the Maitre d', or manager (not sure), she deserves a special mention for being extremely professional, charming, and totally on top of things. It's worth going to Salt just to be in her care for a couple of hours. One visit was to celebrate my birthday, and we were treated to so many little extras that I felt like royalty!The wine list is interesting, and very reasonably priced. This is quite rare in Singapore where one becomes accustomed to being gouged for warm white and chilled red. Your wine will always be the right temperature at Salt.The food is among the best in Singapore. Ingredients are fresh and prime quality. There is a quail entree that nearly made me cry with joy. I've worked my way through the menu, and never been disappointed. Incidentally, the salt grinders work, the bread is divine, and the olive oil is exquisite.Ambience and view are incomparable, and I couldn't do them justice here. But suffice to say I've watched many people walk into the restaurant looking like kids going into Willy Wonka's. Salt is a rare pearl in Singapore, a restaurant in which the service is very good and absolutely consistent, it represents great value for money, has an amazing view, and every visit feels like a great occasion. I'm almost relieved to read some of the old reviews because they might keep the crowds away, and I'll always be able to get a table
5
We have been to 2 other "Salt" restaurants, the first at the Sydney Hilton and the waterborne version on the Sea Jewell. Both were of an exceptional standard and we had the same expectations of the Singapore outlet. Finding the restaurant is a little strange, as you go through the shopping centre and then a couple of elevators, but once there we were in a nicely decorated room with wide views of Singapore. We all opted for the 5 course degustation. Timing of food delivery was excellent, which is not always the case in asia. The 5 courses were nicely balanced, starting with a sashimi and working through to a beautifully cooked aged steak. We also took the wine pairing which was very well put together. It is possible to have some final drinks in the bar upstairs and enjoy the great views of Singapore. All in all, highly recommended. My only comment is that the room sometimes seems a little "bare" but that could be that it was not full on the night we attended
5
I'm not sure that some of the negative reviews for this place are from the same restaurant we went to! We had a fabulous night from start to finish. On entering the dark starry lift to the 55th floor at the iconic I-on Orchard, we enjoyed the whole experience. We were escorted to the bar on 56th floor for some pre-dinner cocktails which were mixed by a superb local mixologist who really knew his flavours as after dinner he mixed us some more that weren't on the menu and based on our prefernce! Trust hime this guys drinks are awesome and the bar manager is also lovely and helpful and welcomming.The food was delicious and okay not served in the highest end fashion and timings for wine and food delivery were not perfect but I still have no complaints as staaff were curteous and helpful at any point. I don't like to be interrupted too much when I'm having dinner and I always rate a restaurant on getting the balance of attentaive but not absent or full on! I felt this balance was achieved in Salt Grill. As we had the tasting menu, we had an array of flavours of local fish, seafood and meat and it was the best meal I had in Singapore of its ilk. Please do try it and I'm sure you won't be disappointed! We loved it so much we went back another night for after dinner drinks and dessert on the Sky Bar. The view is to die for and the surroundings are cool and contemporary with some fantastic subtle lighting which adds to the experience. Only complaint I have is that there appears to be one CD which is on a loop and if you're there for a while, it gets bit silly! Please get some additional music

I would have to agree with a lot of the comments of other diners. The place is difficult to find if you don't know what to look for. The lift lobby to the restaurant is just plain weird - very dark with sky and clouds projected onto the ceiling. A bit too "intimate" if you are on a business dinner. Meet and greet by the staff went well and we were seated at a nice table by the window. The views - oh the views - at night - spectacular.Decor and layout is a bit odd with a ramp up to the skybar. Disjointed, I would say.Service was a little bit lacking. The staff are not warm and friendly but they are not slick and professional either - they could do with some hospitality training.We ordered 3 glasses of champagne (by the glass). Upon pouring by the waiter it was immediately apparent that it was flat but we had to call the waiter's attention to that fact while she continued to pour. To their credit, she did open a new bottle and replace the glasses she had poured. OK but not something we should have had to draw to their attention in a restaurant of this standard.There was a party of 3 of us, two of our mains arrived at the same time, but the third was a couple of minutes later - not a huge deal but just a bit niggly - again - not what one expects in a restaurant of this standard.We didn't have any major problems with the service but I did notice that a couple of tables did. One patron got up and was practically chasing a waiter around the room to get his attention. Amusing but hardly fine dining standards.Now the food - two of us had the fig tart with caramelised onions and bue cheese to start. Light flaky pastry base and the best sweet / savoury /salty flavour blend - divine. The third person in our party had the glass crab omelete. This was very special. Sublime flavours and beautifully cooked and presented.Mains - Barramundi with capers and tomatoes. Lovely flavours, perfectly cooked, beautifully presented. One guest had grilled sirloin. Cooked to specification. The other guest had the day's special of tenderloin with white asparagus. It was a rather generous serve which would suit a larger appetite. The steak, again, cooked to perfection. Sides were a green salad and french fries (normal and the truffle with parmesan).We didn't do dessert.There was no "amuse bouche" but the bread was nice with good quality olive oil and dukkah for dipping.The bill was close to S$700 (3 people, 2 courses each) with a modestly priced bottle of wine (the wines do have quite a large mark-up - we selected one in the lower price range). Yes, we were paying ourselves! Ouch.Would we go back? Great place to take visitors (if you have deep pockets or an expense account) because the views are fabulous. The food is really very nice. The service - not up to expectations but yes, I'd go back but preferably if someone else was paying

What a night out !!!Great and simple food, with flavors speaking for it self.Service very attentive and friendly, with really good knowledge about what they are serving.It was my first visit but I will be back very soon.Keep up the good work

We came in on a Fri night expecting a great experience, and excellent food. The welcoming service was friendly, and the view excellent. From that point on we were left to our own devices. If we wanted service we would have to hail, and when we needed a deeper explanation of the menu with reccomendations, the waiter simply picked up our menu and started reading it. All of our first choices were already sold out for the night ( at 9 pm) and we were left to order barramundi and pork, and two glasses of wine, at $25 each. The mains were both pretty uninteresting. Our side of a tomato, Olive, feta and basil salad, was simply a plate of cherry tomatos ( not premium quality by any means, and a very small dash of the other ingredients). The waiting staff took a while to bring our dishes, and gathered at the other end of the restaurant until we were ready to leave, not clearing our table or refilling drinks. At no point were we asked how our meal was, or given any hint of interest. Definitely not to the same standard of similarly priced restaurants in Singapore. We originally came with the intention to order more and enjoy our evening, but lost enthusiasm as the night drew on. The lack of interest from staff indicated that complaints or requests for service would be met by irritation, and would not be followed up in a courtious way. Even when paying, we were not thanked or engaged with in any way. Unfortunately, I'm sure the owners had higher hopes for their restaurant when they opened

Don't let the location of 55th Floor of ION Orchard give you high expectations of Salt Grill and Sky Bar.Service was slow and we had empty glasses on the table and no orders placed after half an hour.Appetizers of salt and pepper squid and charcuterie were fine - but the latter was begging for something other than plain old white bread baguette slices to go with the foie gras.My Maori fillet was presented as four slices on the plate......with the top two cuts cooked medium-rare as per my order - but the pieces 'hidden' underneath were more like medium-well. The whole steak was dry and rather tasteless. I know I should have sent it back - but quality control should be in the kitchen - not at the table.We were moved to a window table to enjoy our somewhat forgettable dessert of chocolate three ways. The view does make a huge difference - to such an extent that if you don't get a table at or near the window then I just wouldn't bother going. Oh and the view from the washroom is probably the best you'll ever have!Final point: exiting via the ION Orchard shopping centre after hours is somewhat of a challenge and took us about 20 minutes. Restaurant staff could have offered some guidance!

I just was not impressed. This restaurant is on the 55th floor of Ion Orchard, which has a good location, but that was the last thing I was impressed by. I really Singapore but the skyline is not one of its best features, this restaurant seemed to think if you have a view you need to do little else. The food: there was no salt and pepper squid on the menu - this is most of the reason for coming here - your signature dish!!! The rest of the menu was fine but just really boring, nothing better than at any other Australian style restaurant. We had spatchcock and barramundi which were fine but very safe. The wine list was expensive even by Singapore standards. Our table cloth had a hole it in, the service was OK, but more befitting of a cafe. The interior design of the restaurant was inoffensive but not particularly stylish. Overall Salt charged top quality prices and delivers a mid range product

Was looking for a romantic luncheon for our dating anniversary and chose Salt Grill & Sky Bar. We had the brunch menu with sides and beer which was pretty filling! For tapas, we had the prawn & corn toast and tomato & cheese bruschetta. Mains were the Egg Omelette with crab & Miso dressing and the Blue Fin Tuna with Crab salad along with sides of Truffle Oiled & Parmesan Fries and Wild Mushrooms. I would recommend both tapas & the omelette which I though was fairly interesting for an egg dish. The prawn toast was great with plenty of corny taste. My wife, an anti-corn person, felt it was one of the nicest corn dish she had. The bruschetta with tomato was bursting with flavour. Love it! The Blue Fin Tuna was good but had not reached my expectation. Without the sesame crust, I think the tuna would still be the same. Truffle fries was good but we both preferred Overeasy's truffle fries. The mushroom was a disappointment, tasted too charred and shroomy. Got sick of it after 2 bites

Nice restaurant..small but interesting menu...bar and tables have nice city views. One of the best places to take visitors. Waiter was hard to understand.

We had the set dinner for six this week friday and must say we all enjoyed it very much. We will be back for sure. Highly recommended though service staff could be friendlier

I went with my wife for dinner yesterday. Pros: The city view at night and the decor are very good. Almost perfect romantic dinner ambience if you can get a place by the window. The food, if cooked well, can be amazing.Cons: the service is good and attentive while there are few guests but the staff seem unable to handle a full house. We reached Salt Grill at 7.00 pm on a saturday night, till 8.00 we we were having a good time. Appetisers were well amazing (we tried the salt salad and the sashimi) At 8.00 we had a full house with all the tables being filled, the wait staff seemed to disappear for long periods of time. I was ordering drinks by the glass rather than the bottle and we had ordered some sparkling water that was placed away from our table. We were kept waiting for quite long for re fills. The Barramundi is supposed to be one of the signature dishes, I had a really bad experience with it. It seemed like the grill was not properly cleaned after the beef steaks and the fish was cooked on the same grill. The fish reeked of beef drippings. Again, this seemed to me like a mistake the chef makes when in a hurry. We were in a hurry as well so didn't return the food

Amazing view, of course, it's on the 55th level of Orchard Tower. This one is inside, covered, so even with rain you can go up and enjoy your view. With bad weather conditions you cannot go up at 1 Altitude, but with Salt you can. You can almost walk all the way around, so you almost that 360 degree view. High windows, so it doesn't give you that inclosed feeling at all. You even have those telescope view things available. Food is amazing. They have their Salt specials, cuisine is great. It's a bit more private, so if you want a quiet or romantic evening, this is a place I can recommend.Staff is very nice and they give very good service. I asked for a pro secco at the sky bar and he said he didn't have it. Two minutes later, we see him walking up with two bottles in his hand. And yes, he got it from somewhere else. I really appreciate that he made an effort to get us what we liked. I think that is good service !

Had dinner there with work colleague last night. Great city views from the Sky Bar and excellent styling of the entrance, sweeping walkways and decor. The food and service were very good but it was expensive. However I would go again next time im in town. The biggest problem was finding our way out of the Ion Centre when we left. There was no clear route to exit the building so spent 10mins wandering around a closed shopping centre trying to find a way out. Very frustrating.

Singapore had one of those skylines that you just have to see at night and there is no better place than from the comfort of Salt Grill.An express ride straight up from the ION centre on Orchard road brings you out into the muted lit reception. Turning left, it feels like the whole of singapore is laid out in front of you.Very attentive staff seat you with a bit of spiel on which part of singpore you are looking out over, directions etc and then talk you through the varied and refined menu from all over the world.We opted for steaks and were overjoyed at the quality and quantity on offer. Taste and texture was sublime.We actually managed to work through starters, main and desert, all of which were phenomenal, but very filling.Salt grill is not cheap, even by Singapore standards, but as a special occasion celebration in stunning surroundings worth every penny, with pleasant memories that will linger o

For the amount of money you spend in this place you would expect much better food and service, the latter being embarassingly unprofessional. Message to Luke:Could you please send your people to school, they are just clueless. The view is nice.

It was my birthday and I went there with my family. There were 6 of us. We ordered a bottle of sparkling water for just three people in our party. Without asking us, a second bottle was opened. I informed the waitress not to open a third bottle unless we said to do so. Everyone ordered steak for our main course. The food came but when served, we were given the order of the other person's and the plates had to be passed around the table to the right person. Before I ordered my ribeye steak, I was told that i could expect a leaner steak compared to the strip loin steak. Hence, I opted to have the ribeye. Unfortunately, my steak was chewy and rather fatty. By the time I was halfway through my steak, I was tired from the chewing n my jaws ached. I left half of the $69 steak uneaten. There was a choice of sauce for the steak. I opted for the cafe Paris butter. It was oily n didn't taste good. My husband offered me some of his wine sauce. The service was also just so so. I am disappointed cos I had expected more for the price of the food.I am disappointe

We had heard a lot about Salt and were elated to secure a table during the recent Restaurant Week. Regretfully we were not particularly impressed with the menu and level of service rendered. Perhaps it was because of the exemplary service displayed by Garibaldi, another restaurant that we had patronised earlier during Restaurant Week. Starter was a mixture of seafood and sashimi. Sashimi was not as fresh as those that we had tasted in Japanese restaurants. The mains were better. We enjoyed both the barramundi fillet and beef strip loin. In particular, the broth that the fillet was served in was very delightful and interesting. Dessert was the low light of the entire meal. Salt chose to serve sorbet and it looked as if they were bought from the gelato stall on the opposite side of the road. There are many ice-cream vendors such as Udders that do a much better job of ice-creams, gelatos and sorbets, so I would recommend that Salt re-considers this dessert in future. For a fine dining establishment, we found that staff were not attentive enough. E.g. refilling the bread without noticing that the olive oil had run out. Guest had to ask the waiter to top up the olive oil. There weren't that many tables in the restaurant, so I'm surprised that we were served by more than 3 waiters. I would suggest to Salt to improve its service. Whilst the atmosphere and view from the top of ION Orchard is great, the same cannot be said for its food and service

We've been to Salt Grill at ION Orchard two times. For the first time (September'11) my impression was the same as the majority of of the reviews at that time.But the view and atmosphere was great so we decided to come back and check Salt Grill one more time a couple of weeks ago...We were impressed a lot!!! Big improvement. Everything was perfect! The view and atmosphere are still great but what really impressed us this time - the food and the service!!!It was a family dinner of 4 people. For the beginning we had some oysters and they were melting in the mouth, then my husband had a "Sea Tasting" appetizer which he enjoyd a lot, and i had a beetroot salad with smoked goat cheese. To be honest i couldn't imagine that beetroot might have such a great taste!!!For the main both of us had Wagye Tenderloin and it was as excellent as it should be that we didn't need any sauce which they proposed because i believe the only way to enjoy a great steak is to have it just with it's own juice...For our son they proposed Chicken and managed to ajust it to kid's taste. Well done! Our son so liked it that didn't leave a bite for us to try.My Mum had a 6 course degustation set. Very expensive - $200!!! But every dish was excellent!!! The only complaint is the portions are too big for a 6 course set. Why don't they make it smaller and cheaper??? So in the end they brought an absolutely fantastic desert, "Chocolate Three Ways" (as part of this set) and the whole family enjoyed it.Overall it was a great expirience and we'll definately come back to Salt Grill

their foods are just average than i've heard. service are fair according to their price.
remeber to reserve a table next to window, that's all is this restaurant for.

Read the reviews from tripadvisor, which I happen to take pretty seriously. I'm also pretty particular about food. In this case, we had a very good meal. The Wagyu was sold out, so we got a ribeye, which was cooked to perfection. Vegetables cooked al dente, which I really like. My husband ordered fries, which were perfect, I had the mash, which was good, but a tad to creamy. Desert, raspberry souffle was to die for. The only complaint was that while the service was good, it was very disjointed. We didn't have the same server throughout the meal. Sommelier took our wine order, but when the waiter was busy also took our food order. The person who was bussing the dishes also took the dessert order. Yet a different person brought out that order. Waiter came back once to check, but we didn't see him again until the bill

If you can get through the throngs of tourists around Ion, the elevators whisks you away from the melee of LVMH and Prada stores. The atmosphere is wide open and airy, with beautiful views. The chartucerie as an entree was great, as was their signature crab omelet, my personal favorite was the risotto - you see it on the menu a lot at places but rarely is it done very well. A bit of an argument going on at the table over the meat & fish - the place is primarily a steak house so I think it is sacrilige to get fish. I'm still of that opinion, but the fish that i tasted was good. Most of the table opted for either the scotch steak or the rump, The wagyu rump was the perfect color. The scotch / ribeye always has a bit too much fat, but can't get away from it if you want that full flavor. deserts were ok, nothing that inventive but very satisfying. The only thing that could make this better is putting it on an expense account

We went to this restaurant situated on the 55/56 floor of ion. Thought the instructions given to the restaurant were pretty clear contrary to earlier comments. First we head to lobby A and take the lift to the 4th floor to ion art. Check in at the conceige and somebody will lead u to the lift to the restaurant.View from the restaurant is fantastic.....you get a 360 degree view of Singapore, thought was better thn seeing the view from the Singapore flyer.We had the 4 course set lunch, the entrees and deserts are particularly impressive. Service was good unlike previous comments of poor service.Would recommend this restaurant who wanted good dining experience w a sky view

Was here for dinner last night with my family members. First of all, its located centrally along the shopping belt of singapore. The restaurant feels exclusive as one would need to navigate through an art gallery (don't know whether is this a permanent thing) before catching a lift up to the 55th level, striaight! The view from the restaurant is fantastic. We even had this opportunity to see some fireworks from Resort world sentosa. The setting is romantic and distance from table is also far enough for some private time. Its simply romantic if you are sitting by the window. Reminds me of BLU at Shang which offers the same view. This restaurant was started by the celebrity chef Luke Mangan from Australia. The food wise, good and pricing is definitely value in terms of fine dining. Servers are extremely helpful and friendly. As i moved around trying to coax my baby as she got edgy halfway through the meal, the servers and even the kitchen chefs greeted us and was playing with my baby.I ordered a wagyu and wanted it medium rare and no sauce as this is the best way to enjoy a good cut. However, the server kept asking whether i wanted any sauce to go with it after i told her that i do not want any sauce. Makes me wonder...Anyway, overall a very good experience with good food and i like the way they serve olive oil for the bread which is common in the west but not locally here. Total bill comes up to $500 plus for 6 of us and thats a pretty good price in view that some of us even ordered wine

We had a lunch party of 30pax to celebrate my wife's 30th birthday on the 55th floor of ION Orchard. We had two long tables at a private corner of the restaurant, enclosed by glass, even the high domed roof. The views were good on this sunny day, with the simple yet elegant decor completing a cosy and comfy setting.The service staff were very well trained and up to expectations at this establishment helmed by celebrity chef Luke Mangan. They were very helpful and attentive to our needs and yet being able to keep in the background and not getting in the way as people were moving about during the party.The dishes had some unique touches and were delicious. Just recalling them now makes my mouth water. We had the ENTREE: Sashimi, ginger, eschallot and goats feta, MAIN: Maori Lakes beef tenderloin, grilled with celeriac puree,beans and BBQ spices and DESSERT: Luke’s liquorice parfait, lime.The only slight downside was that it got quite hot as the afternoon sun shown through the glass ceiling. It was a great luncheon at a special place with top quality, delicious food

The Salt Grill bar is located on the top of the ION building, from which you have excellent view on Singapore. It is a bit tricky to find, as you need to find the elevators on the 4th floor. The menu has the excellent Wagyu tenderloin on the menu, which I could well appreciate. One waitress was rather disturbing, as she talked ONLY to the one female in the group (and we were with a group of 3). Very strange, but the view and steak compensated largely. Do not forget to make a reservation well in advance
2
it took me 15 minutes to find the entrance on the 4th floor coming from the MRT. For people going there first time include some searching time. Nice lift to the 55th floor. I was the first arriving for our group lunch and the staff tried to place me at the wrong table, easy for me to figure out because I did not know the two gentlemen at the table they wanted to place me. The view from that restaurant is stunning, just unbelievable great. Food was average. Coffee came without milk. I had to ask twice for some milk. The most interesting issue was the unfriendly atmosphere. Just one of the staff was smiling, all others looked really unfriendly. I discussed that with my colleagues and our idea finally was that the team is asked to look "cool" but ... I mean Asia... if people are not smiling, that´s weird and they did not look cool the looked frustrated even pissed. I asked the only smiling woman of that team if there was a non-smiling policy but she smiled and denied
1
Great view and nice space but entrance was convoluted and misleading.Friendly service but poorly trained staff. Only the Japanese manager knew what he was doing. Food was not bad but very very average and Luke Mangan's name was plastered all over the dining room from salt n pepper mills to glasses and plates. Talk about Narcissism!Price was not expensive by Singapore standards and neither was it cheap but the quality of the food was very below par, comparable to a small town café

We were disappointed when we tried to get in at short notice for dinner on a Friday night and were advised the restaurant was fully booked. Instead we went elsewhere (that place will remain nameless as it was incredibly average) and we decided to do some research on Salt to see if we wanted to try again.After viewing the lunch menus for all the major restaurants we were continually drawn back to the Modern European fare of Salt but after reading the trip advisor reviews we were a little worried. We decided to chance it anyway and booked in for a late Sunday lunch at 1pm.We arrived at ION and went up the restaurant's own elevator to Salt Grill where were we welcomed by name and escorted to our window table with a truly incredible view. We requested the shades be lowed to reduce the glare and it was promptly attended to without fuss and to our exact specifications.The SG$60++ lunch special was an absolute steal and started with an amuse bouche of roasted pepper and jamon on incredibly thin melba toast. A delightful combination. Our entrées - Salt's signature salad and the Charcuterie plate were equally as good. The Salt salad was perfectly constructed with a selection of vegetables: baby corn, brocollini, broad beans, if not a few too cannelli beans. The melt in your mouth buffalo mozzarella was a lovely soft contrast against the candied walnuts and was matched perfectly with the slow cooked hens egg which oozed delightfully all over my plate. The salad topped with incredibly thin Melba toasts was very enjoyable.The charcuterie plate, a selection of 3 cured meats with gherkins was wonderfully fresh and perfectly sliced with excellent flavour. A simple dish, it was tied together with extra virgin olive oil.For mains my husband chose the roasted gnocchi, pork and fennel sausage, Parmesan, pangritata. It was an incredibly well balanced dish - plump tender yet firm gnocci covered in a sauce rich in subtle flavour with fennel or carraway seeds. My only criticism was that the chopped wilted greens in the sauce did not integrate as well as perhaps a slightly more wilted spinach would have. Otherwise it was exceptional.M Barramundi fillet, wasabi mayonnaise, green beans with confit eschallot seemed to be missing the confit, and it was a little uninspired presentation-wise. But the beans were exceptional, the barramundi cooked perfectly and the wasabi mayonnaise to die for. A good solid dish. We also shared the Tomato, olive, Tarago River goats feta, basil side which was comprised of exceptionally fresh produce.Desserts were easy choices: Luke’s liquorice parfait, lime for hubby and pineapple, coconut mousse, white chocolate and honeycomb semifreddo, pineapple granita for me.The pineapple desert was delicious, think thick velvety coconut anglaise, topped with juicy and soft finely cubed pineapple (no stringyness here). Pineapple granita which was cool but not icy crowned the pineapple, and two small scoups of white chocolate semifreddo, rolled in toasted almonds and honeycomb topped the show. Delightful.Luke’s liquorice parfait was an absolute triumph. More like a semifreddo, the rich velvety ice cream melted perfectly without a hint of fattiness and left the delightful flavour of licorice dancing on your taste buds. The candied lime could have been a little more candied, and the sharp contrast of the lime may have been better matched by pink grapefruit. But who cares, that licorice parfait was created in heaven!Now a word about the service. Many reviews say it's a bit hit and miss, and to be truthful we were two of only 11 diners there on for Sunday lunch so the wait staff to client ratio was very high (we hear Saturday lunch is also quiet). But I have to say the service was really exceptional. The wait staff were highly attentive and pleasant and took care with their duties - it was actually a pleasure to watch them work. My napkin was not only folded when I left to visit the rest room, a wait staff was there to tuck my chair back under me when I returned. Due to the quiet sitting we were served incredibly quickly and could have been in and out in just over an hour, which for 3 courses in Singapore is virtually unheard of. Perhaps jus a little quick it did give us time to linger over a mint tea and enjoy the view.Don't forget to experience the awesome views from the rest rooms - the men's has a particularly good view to the Marina Bay Sands (yes I couldn't resist a peak!). And don't forget to take the ramp for the sky walk after your meal and enjoy the snippets of information and delightful poetry and words of wisdom before you go. It all makes for a great experience.Our Sunday lunch was Incredibly romantic - a great time and place to take that someone special. Luke Mangan's Salt Grill, with sensational food and excellent service has to be one of Singapore's best kept secrets! I highly recommend a visit

Certainly isn't the cheapest place around, but a perfectly cooked steak, great setting, awesome view. Service was impeccable. Good for a splurge or on expense account...

We went for the set lunch and just to be on the safe side, ordered a side dish of fries. The entree and main were not too bad, edible enough, but the only thing worth eating were the fries.(Could not bring myself to finish the main dish...) So I digged in and went well on my way to finishing it up when I saw a short strand of hair nestled between the salt and fries. SERIOUSLY!! WTH???? I called the waiter over and they cleared the plate, the manager came over a while later to say sorry. I did accept his apology, declined his offer on dessert (no way in hell was I going to eat anything else that came out of the kitchen).The one thing I cannot stand the most is poor hygiene. Bad service I can stand, but hair in my food???? No way in hell.

After reading some of the reviews here, I went to Salt with quite a bit of trepidation. I think the team there might have lifted their game a little bit.I was a little concerned at first when I received a call a day before to confirm the reservation and the lady on the phone asked me which menu my party would be ordering from. She said if some were ordering from the executive lunch menu and some from the a la carte, then she would have to split us up into 2 tables. Very strange, I understand that for degustation menus generally it is a “whole table or none” deal, but not with a 2 course lunch. Anyway I told her that I did not want the table split and she said she would talk to her manager. We got to the restaurant, and had no issues with this at all, the waiter said we could order from either menu, so no harm no foul.The restaurant is in a convenient location, right in the heart of Orchard Road. You take a short, very dark lift ride up to the 55th floor. The view is really quite spectacular as far as Singapore goes. Singapore certainly doesn’t have a breath-taking skyline like some of the other cities around the world but this restaurant does give you a panoramic view of the island, it’s as good as you are going to get here.Décor is fine, minimalist. Glass everywhere. More business-y during the day, but I think it could be quite romantic at night depending on the lighting.The bread was very good. It’s hard finding good bread in Singapore, because I find the breads here too sweet and not substantial, but I was quite happy with the bread served at Salt. Warm, crusty, a bit of bite and not sweet. The food was interesting. I wasn’t bowled over, but it certainly was not as bad as I was anticipating after reading all these reviews. I had the crab omelette starter and the Barra main with several of the side dishes for the table to share. It was fine and served quite promptly. A little bit bland for my taste but that’s a personal preference. The after meal coffee needs a bit of work though. It took a long time and the milk was done incorrectly for a cappuccino. Also I think the temperature of the coffee was not right - a couple of degrees or so too cold. It’s meant to be at a warm drinkable temperature, not cool gulp-able temperature. What I got was essentially a very luke-warm/cool flat white, not a warm cap. Price-wise, well….. Sydney and Perth are way more expensive, but yes this place is not cheap. Service wasn’t bad, except for the long time it took to get the coffees.Judging by the reviews here, I think the issue might be with consistency of service and food, which is the hallmark of established restaurants. If they can start to deliver more consistently, then I think the ratings will go up. It’s not possible to please 100% of the people 100% of the time, but they might need to work on their strike rate a bit more. It’s not anywhere near the top of my list for fine dining restaurants, but it’s not near the bottom either. All in all I would rate this experience as “not bad”

To be fair.....I hosted a dinner for 60. And again to be fair, the view is spectacular on the 55th floor of the ION building. The appetizers served while we enjoyed the view were very good. Deep fried prawns in aoli were actually excellent. From there, I was less than impressed for a very expensive evening. The sashimi was nice, but then again, this more reflected the fish than anything else. The steak.....average.I am a fan of Luke Mangan and have enjoyed the Palace in Melbourne on several occasions. Salt in Singapore doesn't measure up when you consider the cost. I will return however, as I suspect that a group of 60 is a real and maybe unfair test of any restaurant.
3
The view is great, the service impeccable, the food was very good and we loved the atmosphere. Nothing to complain. However, I just find that prices are totally overrated. We paid SGD 600 for 2 including a bottle of wine, no dessert. If I go to a gault millaut restaurant in Europe, I don't pay nearly as much. Sure, it has a great view and location. So do restaurants in Vienna, Paris, Rome and London

Restaurant is located at a very convenient location which is at Ion Orchard. As it is located on the 55th floor, you can see the view of Singapore from here which is quite lovely (a nice alternative from singapore flyer). Was there for lunch with business associates. I had the set lunch which is pretty nice but truthfully, it's more for the ambience than food. As we were a big gp of almost ten pax, we were seated at the corner. The only feedback which we had was that it was too sunny for us. The scorching hot afternoon sunlight which was penetrating through the transparent rooftop made us quite uncomfortable. However, we observed that this was only happening at our corner seat area. Other than that, everything was nice and lovely. I believe the ambience in the evening would be much nicer. A gd option for dinner with the special someone or a great place to dine with friends for special occassions. Reservations is required

I am somewhat embarrassed for Salt and just wish they could start over again and do it properly. We were on a wait list for a table for a week and in desperation pushed the Amex Concierge to get a table no matter what. I absolutely had to eat at Salt. Table secured we arrived for dinner only to find two tables had reserved under our name - we had come off the wait list but no-one ever bothered to let us know. Good news for clairvoyants! The air-conditioning is set unbearably low. Good news for mink coat owners! Half of the T-bone steak was missing. Good news for those on a diet! (The chef later explained all of their T-bones are like that but offered a discount) Two of the other steaks were cooked the wrong way. Good news for gastronomic adventurers! Our orders had been mixed up but were re-fired and came back impeccable. Good news for those who are brave enough to question the difference between rare and medium-rare! The food at Salt is undeniably delicious and the open kitchen makes for an interesting setting high above the glittering city below. Compared to Luke's other restaurants Salt in Singapore lacks decor and design beyond that of the stunning glass bubble penthouse that it's perched inside. Good news for a savvy decorator. Bottom line: give Salt some time and then give them a chance

Luke, why bother coming here and attaching your brand to every piece of glassware, crockery and napkin only to go home and leave the show to inattentive undertrained staff and lazy chefs??We three Aussies and an Englishperson got a great table and confidently ordered degustation menus (both veg.& non veg) and a couple of fine Australian reds ( as the paired wines on offer didn't suit our tastes ... 'sparkling', 'rosé' ...??).We chose to pay extra for the Coffin Bay oysters, as they wern't on our degust and they were excellent. The first few petit-courses were also interesting and delicious. But as the evening moved along the staff started to wander and the food quality unfortunately followed along. We each had our own disappointments that I won't bother detailing (just read some of the other posts . Nothing much has changed), suffice to say that the hype and the price set a fairly high bar and sorry to say that this was no night high-jumping fans. What comes to mind more is something more flakey like hop-skip-jump and at times even hurdling.Free advice: when booking this restaurant don't ask for a window table (unless you expect lots of silences at your table cos when your dining it's the food, the wine and your companions that your looking at) , just ask "will Luke be on that night?". If there's no guarantee then start lowering your expectations and be prepared to settle for the Youth Olympics rather than the real thing

Despite the fact that the majority of reviews were not positive, we had a very pleasant experience, having an intimate birthday dinner with my wife. Service was pretty much up to what one would expect of such an establishment and the food was imaginatively prepared and good. It is popular and is always full, so my guess is that if you went during the peak weekend times the service and food may suffer. And of course, the view is fabulous - although it very likely wouldn't be on a rainy/cloudy day

We went to Salt with a certain degree of apprehension esp due to the mixed reviews it had garnered. Restuarants with a nice view rarely served good food, how true this saying.We had to improvise our beef etc with ketchup and chilli sauce. The only saving grace was its tempura, which was the only thing edible. But it was comparable to the dime a plenty tempura that you can get from the thousands of nondescript Jap restuarants in Singapore.And the desert comprising of 1 scoop of ice cream and a supposedly chocolate cake iwth a melting chocolate inside. There is completely no passion at all to dress up the desert, a really sorry end to a truly sorry dinner. Even family restuarants like Haagen Dacz and Swensens will dress up their deserts with some twirls of fudge or choc sticks but just 1 plain vanilla ice-cream and a chocolate sponge cake. And it was so poorly done that the inside did not have the melting chocolate oozing out,,,,sad state

I'm very surprised Luke Mangan puts his name to the business. If a restaurant wants to be considered fine dining, it needs to deliver. The service was appalling and 5/5 main courses were awful and were left uneaten.Head to somewhere like Absinthe or Oso instead as the owners are present and the restaurants serve excellent food accompanied by excellent service

1) Great views over Singapore (you have about a 50% chance of seeing these) 2) Tourists wearing jeans, t-shirts, and even flip flops!3) The name Luke Mangan plastered on almost everything (including your wine glass)4) Salt and Pepper shakers on the table (unfortunately they had to be used twice)5) A service staff in need of some training (also reminders to bring things like a wine list)6) A huge bill which rivals those of Michelin star restaurants (at least they come close in one category) I hate writing reviews like this but I honestly regret going to this restauran

Celebrated my sister's birthday and everyone loved the food. Atmosphere was also great, very 'special occasion' vibe. Unfortunately service is terrible. Our waiter could barely speak English, didn't bring us menus for ages, and then disappeared for most of the evening. A shame as the food really was good. Steaks, fish, starters, all excellent.

We almost didn't go to Salt Grill due to the reviews on here, coupled with my increasing disappointment in over priced and under delivered big name joints in Singapore.But I am glad we did. The arrival through Ion is a bit odd, and feels a little pedestrian. Yes, there are queues, rules, cards to be collected and handed over at the door. All very Singaporean, and not Â cool.But when you get to restaurant, the view is great. When we arrived the lady at the door was on the phone but showed us to our table, still talking away. So she wasn't listening to me asking about our friends, which got me off side immediately. I turned to one of her colleagues and just explained I wanted to be shown to the table sans phone. He was great about it. He took over, did a great job, and even came back and gave me his name card and apologized later, which he didn't need to do, but nice touch. His last name was Tetsuya so maybe he has family in the industry :-)The walk up the ramp to the bar for a pre dinner drink is great. Gradually climbs as it snakes around the edge. The bar fit out's cool, and not as cookie cutter as lots of joints in Singapore currently. The cocktails are great.Back at the table, service is friendly, helpful and non intrusive. Help with the wine, suggestions on food all much appreciated. The food is all of a high standard. In our table of 6, we were all more impressed with our starters and entrees. The oysters were particularly good, as were tempura prawns and big scallops. To be honest, the mains were all competent but uninspired. The rib eye wasn't a show stopper, the barramundi was cooked nicely but again nothing to rave about and spatchcock again competent but nothing special.Next time (and I will go back) I think I'll suggest to everyone to order multiple entrees and skip the mains.It's not cheap, but by the sky high standards in Singapore these days, it wasn't too bad. We were not ordering from the cheap end of the white wine list, and still it wasn't jaw dropping stuff.All in all, a great space, good food, overall great service. If only every item of napery and tableware wasn't plastered with "Luke"

I had lunch at Salt Grill yesterday and the views are wonderful. However, if you want to see the city, pop up to the bar for a drink and skip the overpriced and chaotically-served restaurant. There are way too many people rushing around with no organisation. Hey Luke - Get an experienced manager in to sort out the staff and you'll operate more efficiently at lower cost. Remember, location-based restaurants only succeed if people have such a wonderful experience that they want to go back again. However, I was most upset to see bluefin tuna on the menu. The southern bluefin is a critically endangered fish and is listed on the Greenpeace red list. Bluefin are farmed in Australia (or rather, caught when very young and fattened in pens) so given the chef's nationality, I'm assuming that was the source - but IF IT IS FARMED, SAY SO! You may be concerned about offending the delicate sensibilities of someone ignorant of the global decline of fish stocks, but you'll balance that with those who understand the damage caused by commercial overfishing and are happy to see some level of awareness.Better yet - take it off the menu

The easiest way to have a dining experience ruined is to be shown to a bad table. Upon entering this establishment, we were promptly shown to the absolutely worst table in the room. The whole point of coming to this restaurant is its view. We were escorted to a table in the corner next to a window that was frosted and therefore opaque. As such, we couldn't see anything! When I complained, i was given the explanation that they were full [on a Sunday] night and that the manager had assigned tables to patrons who had reserved earlier. We were eventually given a respectable table, though the empty table next to the window that we desired, was left empty for 45 mins after were seated.On to the food and service... The manager on duty attempted to make up for the earlier misstep by providing us his personal attention for the wine selection and as we ordered. But on a scale of 1-10, I rate the food a 5 and the service a 3. I sense that Salt Grill aspires to be a fine dining establishment, but at times the service is slow and the cuisine itself is more on the level of a mid-range family restaurant. If you're from the US, think Applebees. Our meal was roughtly S$400. For this price, I expect prompt removal of our plates once we've completed a course. My wife and I have dined at some of the finer establishments around Singapore and in other major cities in Asia, Europe, and the US. Salt Grill simply does not measure up.My advise, stop in for a drink at the bar, enjoy the view, and dine elsewhere

note- we were only at Skybar and not the main restaurantmy wife and i are from Sydney Australia and we wanted a nice place with views to have a cocktail or two.we booked (advisable) , came to Ion, but after we managed to find the concierge desk on level 4, we found out that skybar was closed for a private function, although we were not told this when booking and we returned to out hotel.we returned the next night, but no attempt was made to offer us a complimentary drink etc, even though it was the same receptionist on the level 4 desk.the lift ride, entrance and view from level 56 are superb, but the bar itself seems sterile and has no atmosphere. the temperature was far too cold (even for Singapore), and even through at least one couple had to move down to the main restaurant where it was warmer, they still did adjust the temperature. the high table and stools and glass balustrade don't add to the views or the atmosphere and they would be better with a more cosier feel, because at the moment it just feels like an ordinary hotel's bar.the cocktails were reasonable for the price, but as i guy, i think it ridiculous to pay $16 for an Australian beer (Little Creatures range-not even a really boutique Aussie beer) and thus stuck to the martinis

The entry procedure is fussy and overdone but one you get to the 58th floor the location cannot be bettered - amazing views of the whole of the island. Which is just as well because you will be falling back on those views a lot as the evening goes by. The nice lady on the door seemed a bit unsure of where to seat us and eventually offered us a table near the service area. We suggested another two-top nearer the window and she said something about it being "for a party with a celebration' but then kindly gave it to us anyway. Needless to say the party with the celebration never showed. It was as well that we were away from the service area because the service bar was a complete mess, with food in plastic, dirty dishes and god knows what else on it. It is situated right in front of the window into the kitchen. Amazingly for Singapore, the window was grubby and partially masked by two large portable bread ovens mounted as an afterthought on the back shelf. What was visible of the kitchen was mostly composed of more plastic food containers and the top of the chefs' heads.Eventually the menus came but no drinks were offered. The actual food offerings were quite interesting although the waiters could not tell us what the less obvious cuts of meat were (and I still don't know what a "scotch" is). The one thing for sure is that this is ol' Luke's place - his name is on everything from the glasses to half the entrees. It's also on the wine list: short, good on the Australians but wildly ambitious on the French. When a waiter (I think it's en brigade service but it's very unclear) came back to collect the order we asked for a glass of white wine each and a bottle of red with the meal. The white was served - and then within a minute or two, the starters were suddenly on the table. We had the scallops which were nicely done in a cheese sauce, and my guest had an unfortunate pairing of liquefied feta, ginger and sashimi that was plain gluey Then we sat, and sat and sat. And listened to the crashes from the kitchen and the muddy synthesiser elevator music coming from overhead. And looked at the view (still magnficent).After quite a wait the main courses came and they were very nice, a T-bone cooked as requested, a very tasty pork steak, french fries and a leaf salad: good quality ingredients cooked properly.Around the island of our table rushed the waiters: no-one seemed to know what they were doing and one party simply moved tables for no obvious reason. Other dirty tables were being noisily cleared while certain diners were obviously fuming over the wait for their orders. Suddenly into the middle of all this, an older gentleman in jeans and startling brown shoes arrived and began serving certain favored tables himself.... the chef? the maitre d? the owner?........... His efforts simply underlined the fact that the plot was lost: this is a place full of nice people who might like to work in the restaurant business but need to spend a few day at McD's to see how it's done. Anyway, we then waited a long while for dessert, paid our four hundred dollars and went home.Amusing and dreadful by turns, decent ingredients, lovely view. This is a joint to avoid unless you have a considerable sense of humor and even more considerable spare cash. Come to think of it if this is what he thinks is the high life, I'd avoid anything by Luke Mangan, celebrity or not.

I had the worst steak ever at Salt last week. At almost $60, my ribeye was tasteless, tough, and way overpriced for the quality! If there's such a thing as a synthetic steak, I imagine it would not be far from what I had on my plate. The only redeeming aspect of this restaurant is the view. Everything else from food to service is mediocre at best. Bottomline: Do not go, don't torture your tastebuds ---> Salt = dining kamikaze

Having read most bad reviews about this restaurant, I went with already low expectations. But I wanted to give it a chance because the Salt in Tokyo is very good so wanted to try it for myself. My striploin, ordered medium, was well done at best. The "homemade" bread tasted like paper. The beef must have been really cheap because not only had it no flavour but the sole of my shoe could possibly be more tender than what I was served. The bearnaise that I ordered it with tasted like bad mayo from a jar; one could barely get a hint of tarragon. And for a grill restaurant with steak on the menu, the only red wine available by the glass was pinot noir!I dine out a lot in Singapore and frankly, Salt Grill has hit bottom on my list. I will NEVER go back. A whopper would have been more satisfying because at least you know what to expect. Salt Grill was overprice and truly disgusting. I hope Luke Mangan changes his kitchen staff in Singapore! He should be ashamed to have his name on the restaurant on top of ION. I am hoping they will close to let the space to a restaurant that deserves the great view that they have.Luckily, Daniel Boulud has opened, and his bistro was so good I went twice in 1 week and can't wait to go back
