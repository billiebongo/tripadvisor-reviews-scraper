The dishes are quite authentic. There is also the unlimited side dish serving as seen in most proper Korean restaurant. The food is about $10+ and I think it is reasonable, but due to the location, this place is not exactly the hot spot to go, but if you can make your way there it can be worth it.I like the side dishes especially the Kimchi, done in the Korean way. There are other like bean spout and light vegetables which are pretty good too. And don't forget that at the end of it, there is still desert / fruits!There is a forced serving of $1 / pax for the towel, tea etc which is not really common, but do take note. The towel is kinda cute though, but I won't spoil you fun, go figure it out when you are there

It was at least 2 years since we have been to Ju Shin Jung. This was my 3rd visit - the 1st time was at Katong & the 2nd time was at Guilemard. Both visits were good & I was keen to revisit at an outlet nearer to home. We were there last night about 6+ & the place was about 75% full. It was a Saturday night. While we entered from within the building, I noticed there were people entering from another entrance. It got a bit disorganized as the person in charged seem to hover between the entrance We were at & the other one. Thankfully (or maybe not, considering my moth discovery), we got the table within 10min of our arrival. However, service was slow as we had to wait 10min to catch the attention of the staff & then a while longer for them to take our orders. Drinks came after we asked them for water. $1/ person for water & the barley tea. We decided to go for the BBQ buffet at $50/pax. The appetizers were a good variety but the portion is standard whether or not you are a couple or a family of 4. For the buffet, you get to choose another main dish per person. We chose a Soondubul & a Dolsot. I was hungry & went through the appetizers quite quickly. There wasn’t much space on the table either. We opted to forgo the chicken. The pork belly & pork collar were dry even though we didn’t overcook the meat. The marinated meats were nicer. The marinated meat portions were a bit too much. We wasted quite a bit of food as we were too full. The beef was served almost at the end of the meal about an hour into the meal. The extra main dish were actually full servings. The Dolsot was probably enough for 2 people. It was hardly touched & had to go to waste. We couldn’t take it home because of the restaurant’s policy which is a pity. So Korean BBQ comes with lots of fresh vegetables. We had a variety of lettuces - Lolla, romaine, butterhead. I was about to pop a lettuce with some beef inside. For some reason, I decided to take a 2nd look at what I had in my hand. I noticed a moth still intact & the size of my index finger nail. This totally killed my appetite. I refused to eat anything after see it. I’m guessing the vegetables are not washed before serving!We chose to do the cooking ourselves as the staff was spread thin. It takes effort to catch their attention. They were busy serving, taking orders, clearing tables & cooking. Even when I showed the staff the moth, she jus took the offending piece of lettuce & walked off. Not a word of apology. To add onto the bad service, the place had bad ventilation. The place got very smoky. My eyes started watering midway through dinner. Fans were used to circulate the air. It felt like there was no air extraction to get rid of the smoke so it was just smoke blown around the restaurant. I’m surprised to see many families with young kids. Kids were running in the restaurant’s indoor play area. Not a place i would be allowing young kids to come to, let alone be running & panting. Someone even brought an infant not older that 2 months. In short, not coming to this outlet again.

Been here twice and I simply love it. It's super vegetarian friendly, I was sort of taken aback when I realised that given it's primarily a Korean meat bbq place. I have so far tried their veg dolsat bibimbap and Daenjang. Both were rather great. Apart from the actual food their Banchan is worth a visit. Vegetarians: just ask for customised veg options. Their staff was super friendly and very accomodating. One tip: lunch crowd don't be late. They tend to state they are open until 2.30 but I have seen them run out of food by 1.50 pm... Highly recommended.

For the past few years, my family has eaten at restaurant on Christmas Day. Grilling of meat is very important when we eat here. Staff is competent in that. Quite a lot of side dishes served but taste is so so. I like the barley tea that is free flowing. Also the sweet pumpkin "dessert" served at the beginning of the meal. Ordered the seafood soup, little ingredients, not that good. If you want a quick BBQ meal, this is the place to go
3
Food was ok. Not like wow. Just well ok. We ordered the family set $156+ to share plus additional ginseng chicken soup, Korean pancake, bibimbap & cold noodles. Total price was close to $300 for a family. Not cheap. Quite a lot of food for 5 adults and 2 kids. The food tasted average, nothing really memorable. There was a complimentary rice wine and green tea bingsu ice for dessert. That was ok la. But guess the cost is added into the price anyway. We were seated near the kids corner and unruly children kept throwing the plastic balls outside and hit us several times. Maybe they should add a curtain for the play area doorway. Would I purposely make a trip here to eat again? No. It's quite out of the way. Unless you want to travel for mediocre food or live nearby, why bother? Plenty of yummy Korean food around that's more value for money...

This is one of my favourite restaurants and I have been patronizing it for at least two years. Lunch is of good value. What I love are the generous servings and good range of side dishes. Food is well cooked too. Loved the pumpkin paste given at the start of the meal as well as the vinegar like beverage given at the end. Recently we went there for dinner for a party of 12. 6 adults and 6 kids. As 5 adults wanted the BBQ buffet, 1 adult and 5 other kids doesn't, we decided to sit half half to ensure easy serving of food.However, to our displeasure, the restaurant's staff insisted that for those not having buffet, cannot even sit along the joined table. Has to be seated at a separate table. Was told that all their customers when they eat buffet, all ate the same thing. I found this to be really a very distasteful act. While I understand the considerations of the management, but to insist that 5 kids and 1 adult to be pulled to another table and can't eat with all the other family members, I thought that was a bit too calculative and lack human touch and consideration. Imagine, the kids can't sit with their parents!In the end, as it was too late, we decided not to order buffet and everyone ordered ala carte as well. Though the manager in charge gave us a complimentary pancake later, which I appreciated the thought, however, for such distasteful requests for us to sit in a separate table certainly doesn't sit well with me. Well, probably I will only visit this restaurant during lunches. Don't really appreciate how a loyal customer was being treated.

One of the better and more authentic Korean BBQs along Pasir Road! The side dishes were nice, but the key attraction was the generous portions of tasty meats and seafood - chicken, beef, pork and prawn! Good that their staff helped to BBQ the meats and seafood at the table, then cut them into bite sized and easy to eat pieces!
5
A good selections of BBQ meats with a variety of complimentary veg to go along with it.A great Plc for families with young kids who will scoot away to the safe playgrd (enclosure is padded) after meal, leaving the adults time to enjoy their meal n chat away.Even greater now is that they serve bingsu, a great ending to the meal

My family and I went to the Ju Shin Jung Korean Charcoal BBQ Restaurant for dinner. While the restaurant was quite large with many tables, the food and service were rather average. There were two types of tables: normal tables with chairs or the traditional style floor seats (cushions) with low tables. We were allocated a traditional style seating table. The barbecue grill plate pits were located at the centre of the tables. A range of side dishes was provided with the main dishes. The potatoes side dish was rather good. We ordered three main dishes: Samgyetang (ginseng chicken soup) and two types of barbecue meat. We liked the Samyetang soup! It was delicious! However, the barbecue meat was not really nice (rather bland). The overall dining experience would have been so much better if the air ventilation within the restaurant was better. With so many barbecue grill pits in operation at the same time, the barbecue smoke and smell could be a little unpleasant. The wooden floor at the traditional seating area was also rather oily. Given a choice, we would rather go to another restaurant for Korean Barbecue dinner

This is a Korean BBQ restaurant where the service staffs will BBQ for you. And they are certainly much better at BBQ than if we were to do ourselves. Each BBQ set comes with a side course and many small side dishes. Food quality is above average and quantity is well above average. The BBQ king prawns are fresh. And the price is value for money, especially after their 3-pay-1-free Monday promotion. For better quality meat, need to pay extra. Overall, it is an interesting experience that first timers will enjoy.

- great for families, there's something for everyone
- good location, ample parking and near public transport
- lots of small plate dishes to choose from
- staff can help with the BBQ upon request
4
There for lunch, reasonable price lunch package, with good side dishes refillable, tea dessert etc. Good food, portion large.
5
We love Ju Shin Jung and have returned many times. The side dishes are always interesting and tasty. The meat options are great, service is always pleasant and efficient.
5
We had a satisfying dinner by choosing their bbq buffet dinner. Their side dishes are great as well as the meat. It's great that their tables can accommodate large groups.
4
I was here with a few colleagues for lunch again. They have lunch set range from $9.90 to $12.90. Besides, they will serve dessert (pumpkin paste) and a few side dishes which i love it and its refillable. In the past, they will serve luncheon meat as one of the side but now they don’t.After you meal, they will serve fruits and vinegar drink. It’s so worth it

Visited the outlet at Robertson Quay, loved the service there but not so much on the food. For the price we pay for korean BBQ buffet dinner, I would have expected more choices or selections, but there were only 5 choices of meat and 1 choice for prawns, plus an additional serving of an ala carte dish. It's pretty expensive and the meat cuts are either too bland or too salty. The prawns were fresh however. This was my second visit but I'm quite disappointed that the standards have dropped..

Korean restaurants are gaining popularity in SG over the last decade. Started with that few and now we have many. I frequent Korea as a holiday destination and hence, the minute I entered this restaurant, it gives me the feel of being in Korea except for the language spoken. Wide spread of korean food offered in this place. You can have your cravings satisfied in just one joint. The prices are obviously more expensive compared to Korea but the servings are in decent portion. I love their side dishes, many varieties and tastefully prepared. We had their bbq during dinner and the meat was okay. I had better selections in other restaurants tried but still worth it. Will I return? Yes, to fix my korean food cravings.
5
I certainly recommend this restaurant as the quality of Korean food here is delicious. There is a large variety of side dishes filling the entire table and they are of good quality. We only managed to eat one round of the side dishes as the portion is big (go only with people who could eat a lot). The seafood pancake is excellent with generous portions of fresh prawns. I will skip the BBQ items the next time as they are so-so. The service staff is helpful and fast. However, the table space is really small to fit the many dishes so you have to eat quickly and it does get crowded

The original, this outlet in the West part of Singapore is spacious but feels more like a big canteen (just like the ones in South Korea catering to busloads of tourists). It is located near a MRT station and there is also ample parking on their grounds. Theor reasonably priced food is authentic and in generous servings, including the many side dishes. Like most traditional Korean restaurants, you get a free flow of cold tea and can help yourselves to the paper towels provided at each table
4
This is our favourite Korean restaurant. There are other branches but we prefer this branch for their better service. The place is quite big & the setting is simple, but more important is the food & value.They have great value set menus comprising few different types of sets. Our favourites are the beef bone broth & bimbimbap sets. The rests are not bad too. Side dishes are good & it is refillable. You pay an extra charge for free flow refreshing cold tea.The food is good, and overall one can get a fulfilling & filling set meal for less than the price of a main course elsewhere in town.Make reservations if you intend to come on Saturday as it is quite full

First time my boyfriend and I went to a Korean restaurant, so we really needed some guidance in ordering. Sadly it was clear this restaurant wasn't used to dealing with tourists. We went there for lunch and were surrounded by local workers. Which is, of course, a good sign, when locals frequent a restaurant. Our waiter didn't provide us with much information about the dishes. He only offered one suggestion. I guess his English just wasn't that good, but he really didn't put much effort in helping us.So my boyfriend choose the lunch special he recommended: the galbitang (clear beef rib soup). I went for the dduk bulgogi (beef in a pot). We decided to share the dishes so we could try both. Another waiter served our food and was kind enough to bring a large spoon and two extra bowls which made sharing easier.After we ordered the lunch special we immediately were presented with a lot of side dishes. We really didn't have a clue what most of the dishes were, but I can assure you, they were excellent! Our main dish was soup served in a black stone pot. Sharing was a little bit hard, because of the difficulty of transferring the glass noodles to the little bowls, but we had lots of laughs with it.I found the galbitang not to be that great, but I really, really enjoyed the dduk bulgogi. Such a wonderful sweet soup with thin sliced meat, mushrooms and noodles. An absolute delight.The interior of the restaurant isn't much to speak of, but we didn't mind: we really enjoyed this introduction in Korean cuisine

I was here with my colleagues for a couple of times. They have set lunch which was quite reasonable. I have hotplate chicken set and my colleagues like their beef soup.In addition, I love their refillable side dishes as i find that there are the best from all korean restaurant I've ever tried. Hope they will be able to serve more luncheon meat.Try it if you haven try it before
3
I find side dishes here are the best from all korean restaurant I've ever tried. Moreover, we can refill the side dishes for free! But the price for the main dishes are too expensive I guess compared to the other restaurant. Still, the foods are nice and I like the ambience there, I was seated next to a big glass window. One other thing that I don't like is the staffs working there, they will walk pass your table back and forth and keep eyeing you, which I find it is uncomfortable
3
We have patronized this restaurant for the last few years. Food has always been good. Just a few things to add. Staff are mainly Filipinos (NOT a complaint), but the place does not have good sound-absorption system so it can get super noisy and the noise kinda linger in your head even after you step out of the restaurant. Also, they have a tendency to squeeze you onto their super long tables, so there are many different parties on one long table! Hence, it gives you a very crammed feeling. For reasons not explained to me, I have seen 4 Caucasians seated in the shorter tables meant for 6/8 people whereas a party of 5 adults like ours would be asked to squeeze at the long tables. Not very smart move. Only saving grace is the food. Service also not too bad
2
The restaurant has an all-you-can-eat pork option Mon-Thurs, which is the only option I would take although at sgd 33++ it is expensive. Otherwise the prices are ridiculous. At SGD 22 for 200 grams of pork you would expect good quality. It is not. The kalbigang soup was great, though, but SGD 15++ is a little too expensive for sou
4
A lot of Korean dishes to choose from. We chose the set meal for our group. It was like almost free-flow of meat for BBQ and veggies. The side dishes are also very good.Great tasting food. Very good service! You can just walk-in but try to make a reservation to ensure you have a good seat. This place can be very crowded during lunch time
4
A lot of side dishes that are enough to make you full without even having the BBQ yet! Though the BBQ stove is right in your table, you don really get to BBQ your food yourself as the staff will be there to do it for, which I'm quite unhappy with it as the joy of having BBQ is partly DIY! Anyway the portion of the meat is a lot and try the seafood pancake; it is to die for!! One minus point for this restaurant is there is no suction pipes on every table to suck out the BBQ smoke, so beware, you will smell after eating here
5
This is one Korean restaurant I will go almost once every 2 weeks. I am addicted to their soybean paste soup, something that is consistent and tasted just like how I imagined it every time. I have tried a few Korean restaurants and they seemed to adjust the recipe every now and then. Imagine the disappointment when you were there to find your favourite soup not the same anymore?We tried the BBQ pork and chicken that day, along with my favourite soybean paste soup, spicy chicken rice cake and kimchi pancake. The table was so full that we had to use our most creative way to stack plates. Felt like a royal feast indeed. Kimchi pancake was a bit too flour-y for me, I had better ones before so this was a no-no for me. Marinated BBQ meats were good, surprisingly. Each of us paid $42 (w/o drinks), not really cheap but better than a buffet.I prefer seating on the floor (Korean style) then on chairs as it is usually very tight and noisy. Service was prompt. Down side is after every meal, you smell like a barbeque meat

Went in a group of 6.We we told there is no buffet as it was eve of Good Friday.We ordered 1 set of Beef ribs and another set of pork collar bone. Both sets come with soup.We also ordered a plate of black pork belly as there weren't enough meat. We ordered some dishes recommended by the waitress :- 2 Bibimbap - grains cooked too long and were softer than most K restaurantsJapchae with beef- at $25 per plate it wasn't cheap and there were v few pieces of beef. The noodles were stir fried instead of the usual mixing method so it tasted overcooked.Seafood pancake - Oily, floury and no seafood taste.SABA fish - normal grilled fare... too dry.Before the dishes arrive, we were served drinks and all the side dishes. THERE were the usual kimchi, radishes, onions, kelp soup, bean sprouts, anchovy.The kimchi wasn't very tasty and v salty. Then another waiter did the bbq for us.The pork was either overcooked or the meat was simply tough!Beef tasted better as it was marinated.The pork belly never arrived & no serving personnel was aware until we informed them when paying. The 1st waitress who served us said it was grilled. I told her to check with the waiter.She apologised and amended the bill subsequently.Throughout our dinner, we could smell the smoke from the next table. WE were choked in smokes& had to finish our food faster.We only asked for another plate of bean sprouts.All other side dishes were not finished.The 6 of us felt the food was just average and none of the items were memorable. We had K BBQ in another K restaurant and the ribs and pork belly were worth the price.Service is better than the last dinner ( one of us have been here before)We spent $300 for a group of 6 including taxes

i went to the one in joo jiat 14.2.2012. brought my family 4 pax. arrived at restaurant, ask for seat. young male manager say place is 95% fully book because it is valentine day. at that time there was only three table occupied. he brought us to seat next to occupied, i ask again for table without neigbour but i was turn down. he even say i should go to another place if i not happy with the arrangement. this young man with a ear ring do not know his job well plus bad restaurant table layout. so we accept it because my children were hungry. while eating, discover another male waiter neck tie hanging and rubbing the meat while grilling
5
Wide variety of side dishes, child friendly coz has a kiddy room, a little pricey but fresh and yummy.
4
The food is good. Great variety of vegetable side dishes that they readily refill upon request.
My 4 kids aged 2-9 love the in-house playroom/ballroom.
Nice relaxed atmosphere.
3
BBq meat with refillable of different vege...but advise for min 4 pax and above to go, so that you can try out more varieties of meat. Slightly expensive.
4
Love to eat the bbq meat with a lot of vegetable. And the chicken soup in its value for $$$ lunch.
5
Have been to this outlet at Katong branch,located at 451 Joo Chiat Road.And had tried buffet dinner at $35++per pax.Side dishes were plenty,nearly fill up whole table.All buffet are order through menu with selected meats (pork collar meat,beef and chicken)and come with choice of 1 bowl of soup per pax.Really enjo ythe food there,staff help you grill meats.And most of all this borehead assist.manager Hobin,a great joker and keep up friendly service to all patrons.Will come back for more

Ju Shin Jung is our favorite Korean restaurant. We decided go try it one day after passing by it a few times. What a great find! We have returned many times after that.It's a typical Korean restaurant with great ambience for a family outing, there's even a play area within the restaurant to keep the young customers occupied.Food is great, from the banchan that accompanies the BBQ dishes, to the japchae, pajeon pancake, kimchi stews etc. It is best to go with a crowd to be able to taste the wide variety of food, and also because the portions are not small.Prices are not cheap as Korean food, especially for BBQ, is generally not cheap in Singapore. However, as portions are quite big, it is still value for money for a meal with a crowd. In addition, they do have a BBQ lunch buffet for pork and chicken, not beef. The waiting staff will help with cooking the BBQ, which is a nice touch.A point to note, because it is a BBQ restaurant, if even your meal did not include the BBQ, your clothes and hair will smell of BBQ. Best to make reservations in advance as it can get quite crowded during the weekends at times

We'd seen this restaurant many times, and today was he day we thought we would take the family and enjoy some Korean BBQ. There is a choice of floor or table seating; we chose the table because my recent knee operation would have meant an uncomfortable time sitting on the floor. As soon as we were seated, two dispensers for water and tea were brought to the table, which was a welcome touch. The menu is limited, mainly pork and beef with one chicken and one prawn offering...all of which were to be cooked at the table. We chose the two pork sets - pork collar and pork belly.The sets came with all the condiments, varieties of kimchi, seaweed soup, lettuce leaves, garlic, onions, dipping sauces, so much in fact that we were having trouble getting everything on to the table. There were 4 of us, so every condiment dish was multiplied by four and it look like we were about to have huge feast!The meat came out without delay, and our server proceeded to cook the pork on the BBQ plate. As the meat cooked, she cut it up into small pieces and put them into a dish and then started cooking the chicken and then the prawns. When the prawns were being cooked, she cut the heads off and then cut up the back of the prawns. This was a good touch as it made peeling the prawns much easier.The food was really good, although I wouldn't have minded the meat to be a bit more charred. It was cooked well but I do like the little burnt bits on my meat. I prefer to warp the meat in the lettuce leaves, add some kim chi and chilli sauce. A bit messy but lovely all the same.The set meal came with dessert and also a Yakult-type of rice wine that was supposed to aid the digestion. A new taste for me but enjoyable.Overall, it was a clean place, good and attentive service, good food and decent value for money...well it was fort the 4 of us

I've never fancied korean food till the day I went to Ju Shin Jung. Went to the one at Katong. Big restaurant, and we didn't have to wait for seats. The appetizers are complimentary. The beansprouts are the best I've ever eaten, so crunchy!! And the kimchi pancake is sooo good. Can never get enough of it. Personally I don't like kimchi but the kimchi pancake just taste too good. You'll also be given a large bottle of water and barley tea. At the end of the meal you'll get a piece of heart-shaped watermelon and a cup of cinnamon tea. It feels like authentic korean dining.I ordered the dolsot bibimbap as I don't take meat. It's simple and filling. However I'm not used to the sauce that comes with it so I ate it without the sauce. Most people in the restaurant ate the BBQ I suppose it must be very good. My friend had pork belly kimchi soup and after the meal he was terrified of cabbage ever. Overdose of cabbage on the table. The appetizers had about 3 cabbage dishes. Service was good. We couldn't finish the kimchi pancake and the staff packed it for us to bring home.A little pricey though

This restaurant serves Korean food and pretty authentic. Their side dishes like kimchi and bean sprouts were very nice, so were the meats. They will do the bbqing of the meats for you. Was greeted upon entering the restaurant, and after given the menu, had a hard time locating service staff to place my order. After like 5 minutes, then I managed to get the attention of a waitress from the table nearby. The first instance, she gave me the "not again" look and her actions were pretty larthargic and not smiling at all. After asking her what's the grade of the wagyu beef, she told me that she doesn't know and don't even bother to ask the kitchen staff which I am pretty sure that they will know. Anyhow, placed my orders and she's the one who will be serving us. I caught a glimse of her name tag and realised that she is a Korean and I always thought that Koreans were very helpful and kind. So there goes the dinner, throughout her ordeal serving us, BBQing our meats, she displayed a very negative attitude and even my mother was commenting how come she's like not very happy serving us at all. To be fair to the establishment, the other serving staff were very nice, smile at us when we made eye contact.Price wise, pretty expensive considering location and ambience. Do take note that your apparels will smell when u leave the restaurant as a result of the BBQ. There is a kids corner which I think was thoughtful as it gave us some time to eat while our kids hang around there.Good food but ruin by one server
2
Service staff was busy when I arrived so I patiently waited, but they chose to seat two other groups of guests before me despite the fact that one of the group also only had 2 persons like I did. Maybe it's cause my partner and I dressed casually, but this is just some family restaurant.Finally we were seated at the traditional kneeling seats where we had to take off our slippers. The service staff proceeded to kick our slippers?! Maybe their intentions are good and they would like to rearrange it for us, but no matter what, I don't think they should be kicking it.This is a typrical Korean family restaurant, so there's no real atmosphere to speak of. It is smokey and noisy, so this is not the place to go if you're on a date or romantic outing, or if you have an important meeting after. Cause you're gonna leave the place smelling of BBQ meats.The standard of the food were hits and misses. I would say that the free sides were mostly misses. We didn't bother asking for re-fills at all. The BBQ meats are good, but probably cause that's their main draw. The kimchi soup is not impressive, in fact I would rank it along side with instant noodle soups.Overall I would say that it is overpriced for the level of service and the quality of the food. We paid well over $80 for 2 persons and I would assume this is because the cost of the sides are filtered in; the quantity of the BBQ meat definitely do not reflect the price. So I reckon they should be providing better service and quality food to justify for the cost they are charging

Yummy Korean BBQ, lots of tasty sides.

nice side dishes, very worth going for lunch special

Authentic Korean food

One of the better one in S'pore but quite ex. I prefer Sarabol but can't find it in S'pore
4
very good barbeque
4
If this is authentic, i get to realize that korean food is yummy
4
Everythin abt tis place is authentically korean - authentic korean fd, authentic korean staffs, authentic korean settings, etc. Fd is decent&reasonably priced. Location wise kinda far, its directly opp Haw Par Villa! Btw Haw Par Villa still exists!
3
Not as good as what I thought. Quite ex
4
The food in this place is authentic (I can tell as I am Korean) and I consider it to be in high standard compared to ones in Korea. I have been to both outlets in West and East coast. West coast one is preferred as East Coast one is too big. It makes you feel like you are eating in some warehouse or something. Anyway, food is good and service is also excellent
2
The cold soup that came as a starter was OTT sour. The meat selection was just so-so. The ginger soup taken at the end of freshen up your mouth was like swallowing a spoonful of sweetened sugar. For the price that you pay, you can find better Korean BBQ restaurants around
4
Lots of side dishes.
3
BBQ ribs are GOOD with their salad spread. Very child friendly
4
yummy side dishes
4
One of the good authentic korean food places in Singapore!
4
it is very worth to go for their lunch buffet during the weekdays. ^^
3
pretty good Korean BBQ for the price, west coast one is better, very smokey inside!
5
ox tongue, pork. lotsa refillable kimchi side dishes
4
Family Korean restaurant. Boisterous with an unbelievable variety and amount of those Korean appetizer dishes FOC. Don't order too many mains though cause the servings are rather large. Not exactly a place to go if you don't like your clothes smelling like the food you ate afterwards...but the food is great
5
My all-time favourite! So glad to have discovered it. Best Korean fare in Singapore, as authentic as it gets. The waiters/waitresses are friendly, their service very prompt and genial; they change the grill plates regularly, divide and dispense your soups for you if you're sharing, and even barbeque your raw meat for you. I must say it is better to let them do this for you than to do it yourself as they really do it to perfection, knowing exactly how long it takes to cook the slices to perfection. Bright lighting throughout the restaurant. Choice of sit-on-floor seating, booth seating, private rooms. Unfailingly delightful, value-for-money dining experience :) Not to mention the cutesy 'tissue coins', particularly for those who see them morph for the first time
4
Nice authentic korean bbq - served with plenty of sides (as many refills as your stomach can contain). bbq meat to be wrapped in greens, chilli and farlic - just the way they show in korean drama! 2 branches avail, 1 in west coast and 1 in east coast (how coincidential!
