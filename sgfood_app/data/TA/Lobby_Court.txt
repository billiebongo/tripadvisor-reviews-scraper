Perfect place for a coffee or a drink.
Very relaxing, excellent service.
Had coffee and delicious pastries a couple of times and it was lovely.

We were not interested in the full buffet breakfast, so staff suggested the lobby court. Breakfast was great. Omelet I had was perfectly cooked and very tasty. Mom loved the pancakes. Staff was attentive and very friendly.

Good service but just ok coffee which is over priced. If you're staying in the swissotel you get 20% off with your room key

Whilst waiting for the guestrooms to be ready, we had a drink at the Lobby Court. As it was not crowded, we had a relaxing time there and service was prompt. Tried the Green Detox juice which was refreshing. Avoided the tempting cakes as it was just after lunch.

After being refused entry to Prego for dessert and coffee, we ended up at the lobby court of Swissotel The Stamford. The service staff are very friendly and polite. We ordered 2 cakes and they were well crafted with physical appeal and tasty mix of soft, spongy and crunchy textures. Unfortunately the lattes and coffees were absolutely rude. At $11++ per glass, I am expecting flavorsome, fragrant and freshly grounded beans made by a barista and served with a rosetta. Instead it comes out of a nespresso machine.I receive a much better brew at $5.50++ from Oriole Cafe in Somerset. Even the $7++ from the lobby lounge in Westin Hotel does a better job.

To think that just beside this Lobby Court, streams of guests are checking in/out the hotel. The main entrance is also within touching distance. But sitting at one of the comfortable corners in Lobby Court, one feels like being transformed from the busy floor to a private dining area, which is still situated in the open.Very nice range of cakes and small bites. Attentive service ensures that your every need is served, immediately

A cup of coffee is not cheap at 10-12SGD, a pot of tea a few dollars more pricey, the curated slices of cakes cost a little more than ordering it in nearby Cedele; however, service is friendly, prompt and unobtrusive. More importantly, the sitting space, albeit small, allows good conversation with intimate friends. The added plus is that the hotel is located on an MRT stop (City Hall); in addition, it's easy to hail a cab along the driveway (where car owners can leave their vehicles with respectful valet staff). Tip: Also try a pot of tea or cup of coffee at City Space on the 69F where the panoramic view is priceless

After lunch at the Raffles Courtyard (Please see also review.) and shopping at Raffles City, we were thirsty and We looked for refreshments at the Lobby Court of the Swissotel The Stamford.The Stamford was the highest hotel in the world, when it opened its doors for the first time. It still looks magnificent and fits in perfectly well with the cityscape of Singapore. The hotel incl. the Raffles City complex which also incl. the Fairmont Singapore was designed by architect I.M. Pei. Having visited previously the hotel we knew already the New Asia and Intro Bar, so we thought it was time to try a new outlet.The Lobby Court is located on the ground floor and is a place to see and be seen. The entrance and check-in are located on the same level.The atmosphere was moody with dark furniture and low lightning. To give it a more cosy feeling there were shelves with books and vases and a bar area.The seating was lounge style. We were brought to one of the sofas by a nice waitress. We chose a bottle of still water and two mocktails, the melon cooler and the devil mango. Our drinks were memorable and we felt refreshed.The waitress was attentive and must have overheard we discussed Singapore celebrating 50 years of independence, because she showed us a special glass, that commemorated it and was on sale. It was shaped like the Merlion. There was no visible opening to fill it, so the waitress showed us how you could do it (removing the Merlion's head) and after the head was put on again, a straw could be entered through the Merlion's nostril. It was a novelty and cute. We liked it very much. Our bill was delivered promptly and was 35.31 SGD (ca. 23.45 Euro or 24.95 USD).When at Raffles City and looking for some high quality refreshments we would visit again the Lobby Court.Would we recommend this outlet to a friend? YES!Would we want to visit again this outlet in our future? YES

My friends and I walked around Raffles City and did some shopping. After we got tired, we decided to find a place to hangout and have some desserts.We used our mobile phones to search cafes around the area and did found Lobby Court. We chose this cafe as we saw their mouthwatering dessert photos on the Swissotel The Stamford website.Lobby Court is situated at the Swissotel the Stamford lobby which is a good location, as it is easy for the hotel guests and shoppers to find this cafe. Raffles City and Swissotel are connected which is convenient. Hotel guests can easily do their shopping. Shoppers can conveniently explore the hotel's cafes and restaurants.Lobby Court offered an executive styled cafe concept. The ambience and atmosphere were cozy and relaxing. The tables and chairs settings were well-organized. I adored the grand arrangement of their settings.Staffs greeted and brought us to our selected table nicely. They were gracious and well-mannered. They even recommended their high tea set (tea/ coffee plus pastries). If I am not mistaken, it cost less than $20 for the high tea set. Three of us decided to order their high tea set. They served variety of TWG tea choices. We ordered three high tea set:*TWG jasmine green tea with raspberry pastry (forgot the name of the dessert but it tasted like raspberry with a little bit of mocha taste)*TWG darjeeling with red velvet cake (a must try)*TWG earl grey with tiramisuThree of us shared our desserts. I personally loved their red velvet. It was exquisitely satisfying. The tiramisu was a little bit creamy but still it was delightful. The pastry was crispy with a nice texture of cream filling. Lobby Court's environment is suitable for corporate meetings and social gatherings with acquaintances. They serve savory desserts and pastries. They offered great service too. If you want to have a good quality time alone, Lobby Court is the best place to hangout. :

Thank you to the wonderful waitress who attended to us at 645pm on 21 Feb. We were given complimentary drink vouchers after having to wait ages to check in at Swissotel and were hence not too pleased with the hotel service. However, the waitress who attended to us made us feel much much happier. She made a huge difference to our perception of the hotel, and was super friendly, professional and went the extra mile to make me and my family feel special. Thank you :)

I enjoyed visiting this cafe in the foyer of the Swissotel during my stay. At first whilst waiting for my room to be ready then again a few times. Coffee is ok and the service is great.

Had coffees and cake at the Lobby court and the selction of cakes great and they tasted fantastic. Coffees come in a tall glass and were very good. Being in a major hotel the cost is quite expensive expect $8-10 for coffee/hot chocolate and the same for a small cake plus taxes.Services was friendly, efficient and welcoming

After a long day of helping out with a voluntary organisation, *Charmaine and I decided it was time for a little pampering and catching up, hence we headed to the nearby Lobby Court cafe lounge at Swisshotel the Stamford.Lobby Court is a small but cosy, and tastefully decorated with plushy couches and lit pillars on polished wood panelled floors. I always feel rather halcyon-ic when I am here in this quiet setting, whether for tea or drinks.I remember they serve TWG tea, so that was what we ordered for this cooling Saturday afternoon. I had a pot of Choco Mint Truffle tea (SGD$12.00) - a creamy and rich luscious tea with two of my favorite favors incorporated into a dessert tea.We both loved their Biscottis so much that we actually ordered more (SGD$2.00 for 3 pieces), because the crunchy, buttery cookies were just so tasty. It was the first time we both paid such attention to biscottis before, since usually they were just accompaniments to a hot drink.I had a slice of Raspberry Pistachio cake (SGD$8.90) - chosen amongst three choices. The cake came with a crunchy tart texture, and was richly infused with a nutty and chocolately deliciousness; the texture was a little hard on the outside but tender within, hence balancing the tart to a perfection. The raspberry cream and pistachio combination was brilliant - imagine flavors burst of sour sweetness amongst the more steady base of nuts and chocolate. We both agreed that this dessert was a brilliant choice.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/08/tea-break-at-lobby-court-swissotel.htm

We had breakfast one morning and then afternoon tea one day at this little restaurant, which as far as the food went we could not fault, however the drinks were way overpriced $11 for a hot chocolate!? Which the cup was barely a little over half full and nothing to write home about. The main difficulty that we had with this restaurant was that the glass tables were not suitable to sit and eat comfortably at. Both myself and my daughter are tall and there was. I way we could fit our knees up under the table and the only alternative was to sit sideways which was uncomfortable and you really had to eat with the plate on your lap which wasn't ideal. The second time we visited we asked to sit on the couches just so we were comfortable but again to reach forward to the table was not ideal if you were eating a breakfast or lunch but was just ok for the coffee/cake type situation.Very friendly staff but maybe a little over zealous in their service by coming up asking every few minutes if everything is ok. Lovely food though on offer. Nice and fresh and no limits on how much you could have and some nice alternative choices

Our package at the Swissotel included free cocktails, which we had here. We were impressed by the quality of the drinks and by the attentive staff. It was lovely after a hard day having fun to sit in pleasant surroundings, sip an excellent drink and nibble on the free snacks

I am a Singaporean who has been to the Lobby Court a few times . Usually like to order wine whenever I am there. Sometimes the staff like to TELL you that guests are only entitled one glass of water, which is free, and they are not obliged to serve you more. And we are talking about water from the tap! This rule is set by the bar manager, who will tell you blatantly that this rule is set by her, and if you are not happy about it, you can always go somewhere else! Didn't expect the last bit from the manager of a 5 star hotel. That was the last time I visited the lounge. So guys, if you stop over at the hotel, be mindful about that. One drink and one 'free' glass of water! Nothing more! Any more, you will be reminded by the staff, and perhaps the bar manager Natalie also. So i'd been popping over to the adjacent bar, Ink Bar at The Fairmont. Friendly staff and manager there

My mom and I hung out here one afternoon for their high tea set. The scones, mushroom pastries, sandwiches was great, coupled with TWG tea we had a good time. The set for 2 pax is only S$40++ so I think it's worth it. Service was great, the staffs were very attentive and friendly. Love
