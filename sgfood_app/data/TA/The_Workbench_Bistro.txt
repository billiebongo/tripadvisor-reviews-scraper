This is my regular place to have a cup of coffee and chill. I was with a friend and we were having a good cup of coffee together.

Nice laid back cafe in Ang Mo Kio HDB estate. Good food and reasonable pricing.. ambience is cool and music is soft enough to carry a decent conversation
4
Both main and dessert were great. The salted egg wings is a must try. Cosy place and service is prompt.
4
After much hype about the place so went to try out for dinner.
I would say ok to go but a really must try place... ok lah...
But having that restaurant around the neighbourhood is a plus if too much of the kopitiam ðŸ˜‚
4
went there with my friends, and ordered their pasta and burger. the beef burger was pretty good.
as well as the truffle fries.
4
Food was great! My second time here and will definitely come again. The sweet potato waffles is a must try!
It gets crowded and very hard to move around on the cafe.
4
They were closed at the time of our arrival on CNY eve. There was some mix up with the reservations and staff were ready to close and go home for their reunion dinners. Thankfully they decided to honour the reservations. Although the kitchen had been closed up, we were not given restrictions on the menu, and Food was prepared quickly
3
Not too bad, but not too fantastic too. Nothing really stood out to wow us enough. But for the price point and a HDB location, I would have expected the burgers to have options in how well it would be cooked. Turns out the default is well-done.
4
The food is good for the quality but a bit expensive than that of other similar food places. Lot of options for desserts and the Price Is Right. Indulge yourself in high calorie food and feel sad for the rest of the time you in take such desserts.

Went to Workbench Bistro for Dinner and had crabmeat linguine. Was a bit pricey as the portion was pretty small. My Friends took the salted egg pasta and laska pasta and the portion and taste was good! Ordered waffles with ice cream which came with mash mallows toppings. Pretty decent
3
Service staff are not friendly and attentive enough. Food arrived but did not bother to mentioned we have to help our self with the utensils. I think it will be nice if the service staff are more concern about first time customer.
3
Interesting variety of food and desserts at a fair price. I guess thatâ€™s what makes it so crowded at weekends! Nonetheless, relatively quick and efficient service. I would return.
4
Although the taste of the lava burger I asked for wasn't perfectly aligned to my taste, I feel like coming back to try more options in their menu, as i think is pretty original and creative, the place is very nice and service is welcoming.
5
Had great food and dessert. Coffee was nice but didn't try that during dinner due to my reaction to caffeine at night .
4
Food was affordable and nett priced. Food was worth it for the price paid. Would visit again to try other things on menu
4
A warm and cosy place to catch up with old friends. Stayed there for 3 and half hrs from lunch to coffee!
4
We ordered the crab meat linguine which is average and portion is small.
I prefer the garlicy honey paprika wings and the sweet potato waffle, however I don't like the rums and raisin ice cream.
Will visit again to try other items.
4
Had the salted egg chicken burger which was good. Sweet potato waffle with ice cream and marshmallows is an all time favourite! Had the Oreo coffee ice cream and I loved the intense bittersweet coffee flavor with every bite. Definitely will visit again.
4
interesting food, i had fried chicken waffle with salted egg yolk sauce. nice! will visit again. :) l

Pros: Nestle in a HDB block, spam fries are great and honeyed wings. Cons: F&C is passable, give a miss on salted wings and pasta. Worst of all, ordered a ribs, waited 40 mins so double checked with male wait staff with a black earring and was told is cooking. Waited another 15 mins and double check with another female wait staff. Well done! Our ribs order was not keyed in. Pointed to the male wait staff and act busy and feign ignorance when three of our party pointing fingers at him that order was confirmed by him, Disgusted that he lacked the courtesy to apologise and went out to smoke instead. No more, thanks
4
went on a weekday evening and it was packed! but surprisingly service was pretty fast. food was good, and priced reasonably (as expected for a neighbourhood cafe). one of the better salted egg sauce ive tried in Sg so far. recommend it
4
Had the crabmeat linguine and mushroom pasta. Both pretty good. Topped them off with the sweet potato waffle which went really well with the hazelnut nutella and blueberry cheesecake ice cream!
4
Although it was a self service cafe, when we enter, it felt at home. Food alittle dry but the taste is still fabulous. Interesting place to visit!
4
Food and the service was. The waffle there is a mystery to try. Just find the place a bit small and cramp.

Their pasta's chicken cutlet can be quite salty, even if it's not the salted egg chicken pasta. The portions of the chicken are plentiful, and the texture is nice and crunchy. But the flavor is just a little too salty and oily.Their egg lava burger and purple sweet potato waffles are really good - worth the price and the flavor.Their cost is not really considered "affordable" though. For their pasta, you can find better meals at Swenson's or Hungry Jack's. Of course, the taste is not as good, but if you're looking for a family meal and not hipster expensive fare, this is not the place.Service-wise, we've been there 3 times. All 3 times, the service staff idled around the cashier. I don't know if they didn't notice, pretended not to notice, or didn't know who was responsible for 'welcoming the customer'. At any rate, don't expect to stand at the pedestal outside and expect to be served. You literally have to walk in and approach the staff to get a sitting. Else they will pretend they didn't see you. Similarly, you have to stand at the cashier counter and wave the staff over if you want to order something. I guess they weren't sure who was responsible for "manning the cashier". They're really good at not interacting with the customers.While cleaning up the table, one of the staff knocked over a cup of water. Wipe it up? Apologise? Refill it? None of these things happened, until we commented that it was going to flow off the table and drip onto our laps, that the staff silently took a table cloth to mop it up.It was our misfortune to be there during lunch hour, and observe the staff standing on chairs and rearranging the counter and the shelves. Normally restaurants will opt to do this when no one is in. But there were 10 customers right in front of the shelve, and the female staff continued to rearrange. Unsightly and distracting as we averted our eyes from the counter.Conclusion:Food 4/5 - Tasty. Waffles and Burgers must tryValue 3/5 - On the expensive sideService 2/5 - Not rude, but just unresponsiveAtmosphere 3.5/5 - More about service, but it's fairly alright

Had the salted egg cream sauce pasta. Best I've ever tasted. Not too dry nor too watery, perfect cream sauce. Service a little lackey from the crew. Delivered the dish without utensils. Had to personally walk up the counter to take them myself. Food is worth a try.
3
Pretty good place to eat and chill. The shop is suppose to close at 10pm, but the staff will hint that they are closing soon at 9pm, starting to pack up the table and chairs at 9.30pm and the close the shop at 9.45pm. There were customers who were trying to see if they can grab dessert at 9.45pm but to their dismay, the staff told them it is close
3
Chicken portion was huge & we enjoyed the waffles w ice-cream. It was a hot afternoon and we wanted to sit indoors w d aircon but it's not child friendly inside. So if u have kids & a mid size group of about 5 adults, u will have to settle for outdoors.
4
My overall experience on their quality of food was good! The salted egg chicken pasta is a must try! Its a pity that they ran out of the sweet potato waffles though. Will come by again to try that again. Ambience was also pretty good to begin with
4
I like the neighbourhood vibe of the cafe. The space is a little cramp when it's crowded, but that adds to the vibe.The food is tasty and I would want to come back to try the other items that I've missed out ordering this time. I have tried the chicken wings and the salted egg yolk pasta. Both are good.I am aiming to try the waffles next visit
4
the buttermilk chicken is lovely, the menu should have a choice of add-ons like that to the pastas esp some of the pastas have no meat, like the garlic pasta or arrabbiata.
1
Under cooked and bloody chicken wings which is their signature. BeWare food colouring, causes green bowels!
4
It's a small eatery cafe beneath the iconic Singapore HDB block. It serves a wonderful platter, pasta and dessert. Thumbs up! Will definitely go there again.
3
The sweet potato waffle with ice-cream is quite unique. The coffee was normal and staff was quite friendly.
4
I've been to TWB a few times, and I think the desserts & pastries are generally nice but main courses still have room for improvement. Tried the Purple Sweet Potato Waffles before, which is highly recommended, because there's real purple sweet potato filling in the fluffy waffles. Also ate the Blue Velvet Waffles during my most recent visit. It looked more green than blue, and no special taste, was just pure colouring that made us a bit disappointed. Will stick to the natural flavour waffles next time.The ice cream selection in TWB is quite good too, with unique flavours such as fig, bubur chacha and so on

We found this place and came by for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.The place was like any other hipster cafe; noisy, overpacked with chairs and tables, and full of youngsters.We ordered a Musroom Pasta ($11.90), which turned out to by spicy, but was not indicated on the menu. Had intended to feed our toddler with it, but skipped it when we realised that it was really spicy - like Aglio Olio spicy!Also ordered a TWB Waffle - ($9.00) - it was so-so and not crispy.Then, a Truffle Fries ($9.90) , which was ordinary at best as well with scarcely the taste of truffles on it.Total bill came up to $30.80, which was kinda expensive considering the location.Then again, most wannabe hipster cafes out there are rarely cheap nor affordable.Can't comment much on the atmosphere as the tables were packed too tightly for comfort. No service charges are imposed here, so don't expect much service

What I like about this bistro is the items are pretty innovative and I can come here when I need a change. They have dishes like salted egg chicken pasta which was really flavorful and the chicken nicely deep-fried. Another interesting one is the lava burger which look really juicy and delicious. Overall the food standard were good and it reminded me of an American style cafe for its rich food, large portion and self service concept. Price was on the high side which a pasta cost up to $15.90 and a waffle $8.30. It just indicates how high cost is to run business in Singapore.The shop is hidden in a void-deck of a HDB but somehow it was always packed whenever I walk pass in the past 3 months.I will come back when I need some rich and flavorful food
3
Chope the timing at 2pm, we were there around 2.20pm and there are no seats available, its fully packed inside and no staff attended to us and we are standing at the doorway waiting for the staff to attend to us. Waited quite awhile, I went up to the staff and the staff told me that the waiting time is about 20mins. If that is the case, what is CHOPE for

This cafe bistro is located in ang mo kio ave 1, under hdb block so as what it advertise, it is quite ulu (secluded). However there are still many people inside though. We have ordered pasta, chicken wings, burgers and waffle to try, yummy. You will need to order at the counter and make payment first, food is great and served fast, the only down point is that the place is small and crampy, so will need to squeeze a little. The food has made up for it though, especially its salted egg dishes, must give thumb up. Garlic pasta was unique as well and unique. When we visited the sweet potato waffle is finish, we will definitely be back to try on the sweet potato waffle next time. Their ice cream selection is wide and a lot of unique taste as well. Highly recommended to try

Ordered the sweet potato waffle with a scoop of earl grey fig ice cream, mini marshmallows, crushed oreo & matcha sauce for $11.80, but the sugar content of the sauce overpowered the matcha. >< The earl grey ice cream was also too sweet for me, but this is just my personal opinion. On another note, although I expected the sweet potato waffle to be filling enough alone as lunch, it was still slightly too filling for one person. >< It got a little jelak halfway through. I suggest sharing this with others if you are thinking of trying it
4
The truffle fries was good, the sweet potato waffle is not as bad too but hoping its could be crispy and fluffy kind of waffles. But overall the combination with ice cream is nice
3
Salted Egg Chicken burger was pretty decent; definitely something different but not outstanding. Though the sweet potato waffles was not only unique but good...but not for everyone!
3
It is a pity that the ice cream melt too quickly on the waffles.
Nice truffle fries.
Food servings quite big.
3
Pasta is too soggy (it's cooked for too long). The hazelnut latte does not have much hazelnut taste.
3
Come here for the waffles which was thick and moist; with good salted egg wings to go with their craft beers.
A nice cafe set in a neighborhood HDB estate.
5
love the food here! really loved how the chicken wasnt just tasted just "meh", its like having every bite wants you to have even more bites! The salted egg yolk chicken wings is da bomb.this restaurant can be filled easily and it dosent occupy much customers so come earlier during the peak time if you can

When told that we made a reservation, the few employers asked gave us a blank and/or nonchalant look. The first boy only said "Oh" and left us waiting without telling us what to expect next. The next two ladies also did not explain if we were to join the queue or wait for them to arrange a table. No one attended to us until we asked. First impression was bad, so I won't visit the shop again

Simple industrial theme cafe. We came for their signatures and food is average.1. Salted Egg Chix Pasta - the sauce evidently coat every strands of the linguine. Tad spicy, the taste of salted egg can be richer. 2. Fish N Chips - tender and nice.3. Egg Lava Beef Burger - juicy beef patty, grilled bacon and cheese. Highlight is the lava egg in between the patty 4. Signature Truffle Fries - Just the right taste 5. Sweet Potato Waffle w/Earl Grey & Figs Ice Cream - A little disappointed, not able to taste the sweet potato in the Waffle. The Earl Grey and figs ice cream is yummy!

This is my second visit to WorkBench Bistro. They have renovated the Bistro a little and now the whole bistro looks dark and smaller. They have a display counter for their ice cream which can be a draw for the kids. The space is originally not that big to begin and I think they might have changed the lighting and add more tables - its cramp. They have also put up a black sticker along the glass wall (as an advertisement to their pasta etc) which darkens the whole place. Maybe they were going for a dark and cosy concept. We made a reservations for a table for four near the window and we got a table next to the toilet. We highlighted this to the staff and requested for change to a seat outside and they were prompt in helping us with that. The food and pricing are average. The staff were courteous and tried their best. I really want to support local business but I wished they didn't "overthink" and tried to cramp and "over decorate" the place too much. Disappointed

I visited this outlet. The food was so so. It was very sweet and overpriced. The coffee was terrible. While the cafÃƒÂ© setting is nice and easily accessible from AMK mrt station, I would say Only the waffle are worth the trip. Staff was ok and neutral. Recommend only for the deserts (waffle ice cream
