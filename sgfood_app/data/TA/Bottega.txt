Best Italian food in town at very reasonable prices. Italian cocktails are very good and cheap. Tried out Aperol Spritz and Negroni for drinks and Burrata & Parma for appetizer and Bufala Pizza for main course.

Nice place for a casual night out, with everything you need under the Italian sun. Pizza was tasty, my only qualms was that the pizza center was rather soggy. Service staff was really prompt and impeccable. Thanks! Will be back, soon I hope.

Good food in the famed food enclave. Could improve on expanding the dessert and drink menu. Also, incorporate set meals for more bang for the buck.

Penne Pesto is not pesto. First because there's too much white cream and also because it's too spicy so I couldn't taste the "pesto".

Cannot say anything about the quality of the food as after booking a table we went there (5 minutes early) on a Friday night, but the place was not open.
Will have to try again.

The system does not work -I made a booking, it was accepted but when I got there the restaurant advised me it was closed that night

Food is average. The beef tagatelle was dry and too salty. Pizza was good but nothing extraordinary.

A small restaurant that mainly sells pizzas & pastas. Restaurant looks like a mini Italian supermarket too, it sells quite a bit of stuffs for cooking which are not available at usual supermkts. The beef pasta was quite nice but portion is bit small. Pizzas are mostly thin crust, taste was normal in my opinion. There was only 1 type of Italian beer but it was good

I'm turning into a frequent diner at this quaint spot on Tanjung Katong Road. Using the freshest ingredients, Bottega serves authentic, delicious and comforting Italian cuisine. With specials to keep the menu interesting, this place is great for couples or groups. Staff are friendly, patient and knowledgeable. Highly recommended!

My Italian friends recommended me this place. I go there whenever I crave for a pizza. I have tried a few other dishes including desserts and they are all good and quite affordable for Singapore.The space is limited and it's quite popular so I recommend making a reservation before you go
