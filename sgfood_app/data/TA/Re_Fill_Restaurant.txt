No need to run out to eat, just within the premise great dishes are available.

This tackily furnished hotel/restaurant offers less than mediocre food (they managed to overcook our burgers and burn the buns) and less than mediocre customer service. I would recommend to steer away.

Dinner was very badly cooked to the point of being inedible. Breakfast disgusting. Fried eggs are cooked and left out in the open to go cold and hard. Hardly hygienic.

Brilliant food. I order chicken curry which was too good and taste was as per my request just like Indian Chicken curry.

Being in the hotel it was bit pricey than what you can buy in the near by Chinatown area thou. Same taste kinda but just bit more fancy then a hawker centre.

Should have more cereal and pastries. Omelette was ok and the coffee was good. Service need to be improved. We had to wait quite a bit to get our bill.

I really enjoyed coming to Re!Fill, mainly due to its quality food and friendly service. It may be slightly on the pricey side, but I am hooked on the 1 for 1 Abalone Laksa and their Mushroom Soup. For a small hotel located rather far from the main city area, I would say the food quality really exceed my expectations. Food is really fresh and cooked on the spot.The restaurant’s service crew is really attentive to your needs! Really commendable, especially the restaurant manager. For a quiet dining experience, this is a to go place! There is rarely crowd. But location wise, I strongly recommend to drive there

Variation in Service Quality? A case study I used to think that the one of the major reasons for Singapore to rise and prosper is its high quality service in the service industry, and my past visits to this country and the hotels that I stayed in generally supports the assumption. However, my stay at Hotel Re!@Pearl’s Hill, March 22,2015 to March 24, 2015 tells me a different story. There are variations.  The front desk staff are professional and courteous. They answered questions politely, helped me with the internet connections of the lobby computer, handed me the door cards and room invoice with both hands. They ended their conversations with hotel guests with either “sir” or “madam”. I feel respected and returned their goodwill and service with “please,” and “thanks.”  Greetings like “good morning, sir,” or “good evening, sir,” from house-keeping staff did not come as a surprise when I walked to my room and happened to run into them.  I always have the assumption that in any hotels, luxury or budget, it is the care for details and small things that count.  What happened Tuesday morning advises me not to take things for granted. There are exceptions.  To catch a flgith that moning, I woke up at 06:30 hours by morning call and dragged my bags to the lobby at 07:00 and completed check-out at 07:20.  Buffet breakfast is at 07:30 in the hotel restaurant located next to the Reception desk. To kill the time, I left my luggage with the Reception, picked up a newspaper, and walked a few steps into the restaurant, as there was plenty of chairs and no one in.  “Morning, I will just wait here and read the newspaper, “ I said to a waitress. She smiled, returned the greeting and switched on the light, went on to prepare the food. Mr Lee Kwan Yew passed away on Mar 23. The whole country was mourning. I buried myself in the newspaper. “Who let you in?” A skinny waiter suddenly appeared in front of me, and demanded. He sounded like a security guard questioning a suspect. The restaurant entrance was wide open to the lobby. There is no sign whatsoever indicating that it is a restricted area during non-service hours and trespassers shall be punished in accordance with the Laws of the Republic of Singapore. There was no rope hanging across the entrance, as is usually case in other hotels when preparation was going on and it was not convenient for guests to come in. They might sue the hotel management in case of injury in accordance with civil legal legislation. But I was sitting about 7 to 8 meters away from the food counter. It was highly unlikely that I might cause any inconvenience to their work.  I tried to explain that I was checking out and need to catch a flight after a quick breakfast. I was just reading the newspaper. “You mustn’t read here. You can use the lobby chair and do it over there.” He was demanding. I assumed he was following hotel rules, perhaps, though I had not been briefed as to what it really was. He was responsible, anyway, I presumed. Singapore is a country of law and order. So I moved out and continued with reading. He turned off the light, a good move at energy saving! With regard to his manner, anybody is supposed to express some degree of disapproval or even anger when hotel policy or regulations are breached in this country of law and order. But still, he behaved like a misfit, not the type of Hotel Re! staff that I was used to.  At 0700 hours, the restaurant was still dark and there was no sign of operation. I walked inside and asked the lights to be switched on. There was still last-minute activities going on. Question 1 : If the hotel expects guests to follow rules, may the guests expect the light to be on and the dining area open at 7 o’clock and the usher standing at the entrance? There were only three early birds in the area. I was in the middle of the breakfast when the waiter/usher came over. “Your room number?” He questioned abruptly. I was impressed by his succinct way of communication. I did not feel this culture in other departments in the same hotel, though. When I finished the toast, eggs and milk, and went to the salad table to get some fruits. The waiter was standing behind the table, playing with his cell phone with both hands.Question 2: Since the waiter is so strict with hotel rules and so responsible, may the guests expect some degree of due diligence on the part of the hotel? Or is it the hotel policy that staff are allowed to handle emergency calls with two hands?  I have been told that a team is as strong as its weakest link. May I have some clarification, please?

I had salmon salad, fried spring rolls, and grass jelly with lychee.The salmon salad was a bit salty, but generally it tasted good.The other two, on the other hand, tasted great!I thought hotel food would be average, but apparently they exceeded my expectations. Recommended

Had pumpkin soup and toast. the soap had some much oil in it you could see an oil slick, couldn't eat it. toast was more like bread and stale bread at that

I was there for chilling out at its breezy chillout alfresco bar Re-Wine, perched on the second floor balcony overlooking scenic night views of the CBD / Chinatown area. This open concept bar is tacky in a sleek, retro manner complete with red vinyl seats, black-white checkered tiles, billiard table and pictures of gorgeous Hollywood classic beauties such as Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn - I loved it instantly.Drinks to start off the chilling out session and great retro music to match, of course. A glass of red wine and Lobster Bisque with Atlantic Scallops - a delicious, rich soup simmered to perfection with the sweetness of lobster and generous seared scallops and slipper lobster.Next, the Crabmeat Fried Rice with Salted Fish - another palatable, flavor-filled delicacy with lots of seafood ingredients - you can already see the large juicy shrimps, crabmeat, silver sprout, Chicken sausage and eggs scattered around the right-textured rice. Every bite exploded with goodness, and the fried rice was not oily at all. The portion was rather huge, though.For more detailed information and photos, do check out:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/chilling-out-at-re-wine-at-hotel-re.htm
