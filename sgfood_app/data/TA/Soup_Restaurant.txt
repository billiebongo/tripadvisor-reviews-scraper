Food was good as usual, definitely cannot miss out on their classic ginger chicken. Itâ€™s a must try for us every time. Reasonably priced for the quality of food

Only like their chicken with ginger sauces.
The rest of the dishes are average.
Service is very average.

Environment is clean and comfortable. Service crew is good smile with good manners. We ordered their famous dishes white chicken with ginger. Taste good. We requested they add more ginger , they were pleasure to give us more. Feel very good service.

Went on Friday weekend counter staffs was accommodating allowing us to store our shopping stuffs and bags at the counter while we returned back to the restaurant at 7.30pm table reservation. Very crowded on weekend reservation is a must to seat in. Typical Chinese restaurant served great ginger chicken and the portion were decent

Had a good family dinner. Still quite consistent in their quality. Ordered their famous chicken, soup (pork ribs with winter melon), sweet sour pork, minced meat with salted fish, fried fish with spring onions, Long beans and some mantou for 6 pax. About $25 per pax.

Went for family dinner. Ordered their signarure steam chicken, loving it especially the ginger dressing. I think with ginger alone I can finish a bowl of rice :D chicken prepared soft and juicy, ginger source with nice sesame oil aroma.Had tofu, spinach served with century egg and salted egg and soups. All tasted good.Thoughtful setting suitable for 2, small family of 4 to 6 and more

Went with family of 3 for dinner yesterday at Soup Restaurant at century square branch. Ordered a mother's day promo deal for 4 pax at $178. Food arrived swiftly after waiting for some time due to peak hour which is understandable. Staff was attentive and helpful. Samsui chicken was good as always. Abalone dish comes with set meal which was yummy. Soup was good. Scallop dish was not bad. Only downside is the salted egg shrimp dish. A little too soggy if not will be good. Though the bill added up to $200 ++, I would still go for the samsui chicken.

As we were a group of 7 ; we could order only 5 items under 4 pax menu & 4 items under 3 pax menu which is $16.90++ pp. Only 2 dishes were of proper size - Samsui chicken & individual corn/rib soup. Rice is considered an item (tiny bowl). Other items proportion is horribly off (meant for only 2-3 pax). It's not considered a meal worth as it was too little to fill our tummies. Service was awful. Long wait for our hot teas. No one bothered about us as they put us in the corner with all the baby chairs. Everything was long wait. Won't recommend this branch.

We often go to Soup Restaurant and have our typical dishes. This is comfort food for the family. The place is clean, nice decorations and comfortable.The typical orders are chicken with their special ginger sauce, claypoy tofu and her fried french beans. Other dishes we have tried and like are the sweet and sour pork, double boiler soup.Reasonably priced, good family dining place
