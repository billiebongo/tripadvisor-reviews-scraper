Visited with my girlfriend and had drinks and food. The drinks were really good (can recommend the smokey old fashion) and the food tasted was great! The staff were all nice.
4
I love sharing food more than main food, good place with friend for gathering.. dessert taste standard
5
Service was great and so was the food!! House cured bacon going with the scrambled eggs is brilliant but there wasn't any churros available though.
4
A cosy hideout, tucked away in the confines of the cbd. Do come for the brunch and the bar. You'll enjoy it.
4
I have been there since first month I moved to Singapore. Feel a bit pricey but worth to pay. Strong taste of spirits. Recommend!
3
I think this place is overhyped, or maybe it's just trying to be really laidback. The food and menu is average. The drinks were also average and took a while to arrive.
4
Proper place for convivial drinks. Service OK, vibes good. Little bit off the main Ann Siang Road strip, and that's good too.
5
I was quite surprised to find that it was not very crowded on a Friday night. It is a bit hard to find but that's what makes it special. I really loved their scotch egg and the meatball. The food was not very heavy for dinner either. The environment was very nice for chatting with your friends. I will definitely revisit for the food
5
Saturday brunch was just the two of us in the entire restaurant which was surprising! Ordered the pancakes and the burger - the pancakes were beautifully fluffy and the yuzu cuts the sweetness of the maple and honeycomb, providing a lovely balance. The burger was pretty decent, but nothing exceptionally fantastic. Scotch eggs came w raving reviews from the partner as well. Warm ambience and attentive service staff. Drinks arenâ€™t on the menu but just order your regular (at standard prices too). Spent 80sgd for two mains, one appetizer, one side and 2 coffees.

This restaurant has a lovely, chilled vibe, with friendly, attentive staff and a good menu. However, the Eggs Benedict I ordered - although delicious - was the smallest I have ever been served in my life! The eggs were petite and the muffin they sat on was cut so that it was just big enough to hold them. It wasn't cheap, either. I would recommend this place, but perhaps have a hearty breakfast/lunch elsewhere first
3
this is maybe a good place for drinks with friends or colleagues but not such a good place for food. this is discrepancy between their menu online and what they offer there
5
I really like the atmosphere here at Club Street Social. Good food and drinks, friendly staff, convenient location.
4
Well worth a visit for drinks. Great service and reasonably priced drinks. Good atmosphere. Sit outside for pre dinner drinks.
4
A quaint little spot in the bustling area of Club Street. A little pricy but you'll certainly have a good time.
4
Lunch was good. Pity that the menu was really lacking in terms of choices! Taste-wise was good, nothing too spectacular.
3
Went for brunch, it was average, I find the hype or rave reviews Club Street Social received is somehow overrated. Just a pub turn restaurant in day time.
3
A place where many people meet to have a few before going for dinner at some of the other restaurants in the vicinity. drinks are usually singapore prices and your bar tab can add up quickly.
3
Was hosted to lunch here. Suggest that if you drive, go park you car at PwC building across the Pickering Road. I had the beef steak salad which had the beef rare and wasnâ€™t asked about how I want me beef to be cooked. My friends had the fish seared but was really a small portion. Service was alright and there could be better options of food around this area.
2
On a Saturday evening this was deserted. The decent drinks aside, the service was brusque and appalling. The server dished coasters like he was dealing poker cards, and when he spilled one of our drinks as he placed it clumsily on the table, he didn't deign to apologise or get us a napkin for the spill. He just went on with his own business. When we asked for some napkins, he brought only one back-- for a table of five. This suggests that he knew that the spillage was an issue but that he didn't bother to do anything about it. Overall he seemed more happy chatting with the bartender at the bar than waiting on customers-- not that there were any besides our table.
4
Booked the place for a private event , perfect for 40-60 people , great location just next to Club Street . We had a really fantastic evening , lots of fun thanks to the restaurant team that took really good care of us . Thanks !
4
Nice little bar tucked away in Gemmill Street, nice layout, good selection of beers, helpful and friendly staff, didn't try the food but there is a good menu there
5
Quiet and spacious, great for starting a peaceful weekend!
Loved the delicious food and great service too!
4
Just as the name suggests, tis agreat place to meet up with friends. Outdoor seating, wine selection, eats selection all very delightful.
5
Dined there for lunch with friends
Ambience/Design very much like a Bourbon Bar in Kentucky but this time with food and cocktails.
Small select menu- fantastic Burger and great looking fish dish and Kale salads.
Service discreet but very efficient.
Will be back shortly
3
Comfy ambience, but food was at best alright. Waitstaff were attentive which is a plus point.Duck Pizza ($19+): Duck confit, leek, GruyÃ¨re cheese. The base was a little thicker than I am used to, but I enjoyed this pizza. A good balance of sweet & savoury. Wouldn't complain if there were more duck, though..Risotto ($22+): Spinach & Kale Risotto with Feta Cheese. Super creamy. Risotto was well done, but overall this dish was too salty for me. Loved the pinenuts though - they added great texture. Accepts credit cards  Air-conditioned seats  Accepts reservations - I used Chope  No service charge  Waitstaff were very attentive.. Kept refilling my water
4
This is a turnoff from the club street main stretch. Hidden find , less noisy. Lovely interior, chilled out vibe about the whole place... Staff service was friendly and efficient.!we had the duck confit pizza , salmon and few glasses of wine- sgd 98 with no service charge in the bill. Pizza had a thick bread like dough . Different from thin crust pizza.
4
Good food. Great Cocktails. We tried some small plates to start -- soft shell crab, fried chicken, beetroot salad, and a buffalo mozzarella pizza. All were perfect for sharing among four of us. We then also shared two orders of sous vide flank steak and an order of the fries. It was perfect for a casual night out with friends. The decor and casual atmosphere reminded me of an NYC neighborhood joint. Lots of fun and very different from the usual SG restaurant. We brought our own wine and corkage was reasonable. We also had a Survival Chic Card, which earned us 30% off the entire bill. So for us it was really great bargain night out
1
The worst service! The server even admitted they were "overwhelmed", but it is not a large restaurant so it's mystifying how the servers could be overwhelmed. We had to ask for menus, ask to have our order taken, ask again for more drinks, ask for desert, and a long wait to get our food each time. The food was not so great either. With literally thousands of restaurants in Singapore, there are surely thousands of better choices.
3
drinks in singapore are not cheap anywhere really so what makes a place more attractive ? Well location is decent in that it's close to some very good restaurant (ie lukes ) and also next to the bustling drinks area of the namesake of the bar (club st). They also serve food here but this is much more of a drinking place with some snacks. It gets busy on a Friday with the sometimes rowdy raffles place office crowd (foreigners) making a pit stop here.
5
My first time visiting on a Saturday for dinner. We ordered the kale salad, veal & pork meatballs, oxtail pasta, and lamb shoulder on toast. By mistake they also keyed in soft shell crab which they graciously let us have at no charge (since it was already prepared). Food was delicious and not just the usual stuff that one finds everywhere. I was worried it might be very crowded noisy but it turned out to be neither. The restaurant was comfortable because there were a few other groups of diners there, and the ceiling is high enough that the chatter doesn't get overwhelmingly loud. We didn't have to shout to hear each other.The staff were attentive and friendly. They remembered what drinks we'd ordered in the first round, when asking if we wanted a second round. I would definitely go there again to chill out with friends
5
Wow! The food was simply heavenly! We tried the soft shell crab and risotto! You gonna try it to believe it. If you hate crowds, you might want to go on a weekday night. :)
4
Loved the huge bowl of fries to go with the booze.
Had the fried chicken which was great as well!
Overall i wouldn't mind coming again.
4
My wife and I dined here and to be perfectly honest I can't remember what we had but I do know that the lasting impression is that it was fresh,tasty,good value and worth the effort of looking this small restaurant up.
4
Didn't try the food.. But the drinks were good and I like the ambiance. Relax, cool, no frill, good service.
5
Perfect place to enjoy Singapore night life... Great crowd... It's a perfect place to be with friends , couple, family and everyone... Very descent and excellent people around... Walking distance from raffle place MRT
5
I tend to go to Club Street more often in the evening, but a friend working in CBD suggested we check out Club Street Social for a fun, easy lunch. Since I was in the mood for something healthy and not too heavy, I took a kale salad with cauliflower, feta and tahini - it was delicious... I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was actually delicious. One friend - who had a bit more of an appetite - took a risotto with spinach and goat cheese, and another one ordered a meatball & mozzarella sandwich which I luckily managed to sneak a few bites of. While having lunch I spotted a dish on the menu featuring Sicilian eggs with tomato, burrata, spinach, and sourdough toast... which lured me back for brunch with a group of friends.... needless to say, we got into the wine, and left happy. But those who think this is only a drinks spot are missing out - the food is definitely worth a try
5
CSS has such a cool vibe. Welcoming and friendly and there staff are so nice.The food is simple and healthy and good for lunches or bites after work. It's the best place in town for a chill beer after work if you are in the downtown. You get away from the crowds a bit, less hectic and low end, more chill-classy-bistro and always amazing music
2
Came here with a few friends a few weeks ago, and we left the restaurant feeling hungry although we had two courses and some wine. Portions are rather small. The service staff of the evening wasn't much better, we generally didn't feel welcome. To their credit, a bottle we felt corked was exchanged for free after some discussion
4
Simple. Unassuming decor. Serves a decent brunch/ lunch with some interesting cocktails on the menu. The coffee looks good. The piled pork Benedict was an Interesting take on the regular eggs Benedict. Portions, rather small when you consider the prices . Would I return.... Probably yes!
4
I was returning to Club Street Social after a long time and had good memories of it from my last visit, which had been for brunch.This time I went for dinner and we decided to order their sharing plates. We opted for the duck confit Caesar salad which was good, beetroot and burrata which was a bit bland, fried chicken which was very nice and lamb short ribs which were also goodWe followed this with tiramisu served with shots of Becherovka, a Czech digestif that's made with herbs and spices. This was so good that we had two more shots of it!Overall good food, nice ambience and good bar. I probably will go back again
5
I really really love this place!! I met up with my dad here for dinner.. My dad who never likes italian actually praised their linguine :)
2
This is a trendy looking restaurant in a trendy part of town.I went there for lunch with a friend. We had the two course set lunch each, and a glass of wine each. S$100. Too expensive for what you get. Although the food quality was good, the portions were very small, the wine by the glass is a laughably small poor, and twice I had to get up to go to the counter to get some attention.Net: not good value for mone
3
Tucked in the more quiet neighborhood near Ann Siang Hill, Club Street Social is a g- to place for the locals. Went here for a breakfast with my ex-colleague and it was not disappointed. The scramble egg was great and fluffy, toasts are perfectly made. Price is average compared to other Singaporean cafes
5
Been there for the first time last week while I was looking for a nice breakfast. The food and the coffee was great. The small restaurant/bistro/pub has a nice relaxing atmosphere and Inviting to stay longer. The service was great as well. I will come back for sure to make it my number one breakfast bistro in Singapore.Thanks!
5
Yup - glad I found it open - still good, coffi's great, hot chocolate great and the typical brekkie suggestions are both tasty, good and of value - glad they are holding the standard - walked past there late the night before and the party in there was wild - expats letting lose and the waitstaff and I chatted a while - meh, youth and alcohol = that's what you get - looked like they were having a blast tho..
4
Located in Club Street near Ann Siang Road, this small but intimate bar is a nice spot to have a pre-dinner drink (but remember you will be paying $A20-25 for a cocktail). The bar has tables spilling out into the street so you can enjoy the streetscape of this interesting pocket of Singapore. You can also eat there but we did not. You can also venture to Ann Siang to any number of bars and eateries to continue your evening - it was certainly buzzing when we were there
5
Love the vibe here - so chilled and quite hip. Just perfectly tucked behind club street to avoid the rowdy crowds. Recommend the prosciutto paninis and the 22 cocktails - delish. Can't wait to try their breakfast menu - that looks fab too. OH and the chocolate nutella bread and butter pudding - YUM.
5
Simon behind the bar brought me back to life with three cappuccino's in a row after a horrendous jet lag experience - sufficient to speed me around the harbor loop in no time at all - scrambled eggs with avocado seemed to be the popular item on the menu and I didn't step out of line. Cool joint, good service, nice vibe - dig it
4
Came here for weekend breakfast and wasn't disappointed. This restaurant has great name in the local community and hadn't gotten around to coming here until now. Friendly and helpful staff and fast efficient service. Food quality was good with the menu having a number of yummy dishes.
4
It was a Saturday evening, we arrived close to 6pm and found the place near empty. Throughout the two and a half hours we were there, we were almost the only guests. We had the highly recommended Social Burger, Duck Confit Panini and Creme Brulee. Generally very happy with the food. It's quite a nice place to chill out. Within walking distance to Telok Ayer Downtown line MRT. Hope the place will survive
5
Lovely relaxed bar with great staff. I haven't eaten her, but the bar scene is very good. Lively straight from work. Would recommend.
5
Located round the corner from where we were staying, a visit to CSC was inevitable. With quite a good beer selection, it was a pleasure to enjoy a frosty Tuatara Pilsner, cold glasses are a welcome touch in the 35 degree + heat.
5
Small open air room with a well stocked bar and bubbly, energetic and hospitable owner/bartender/server :) great for a afternoon snack and cocktails. Will be back fo sho.
4
Nothing fancy about this review except the coffee was fantastic! For anyone that's lived in Singapore, this isn't always easy to find.
Thank you Club St Social for my 4pm 'pick me up'... I will be back!
2
Went there at lunch time on a Tuesday. The place was empty as it usually is at lunchtime. I sat at a table to be able to work on my computer whilst waiting for my burger. I was asked to change seats and showed to a bistro type 50 cm wide table. The other table had to be free for potential guests of 3 +, which never came but would have had the choice of 4 different tables in restaurant. The burger was super salty, offered without any fries and expensive. Don't go if you don't want a beer or drinks after work
4
This was one of the first places we found for great coffee in Singapore, it's still great.Don't expect the typical 'big breakfast', the menu is short but each item is well thought out. The scrambled eggs are creamy and soft and the bacon and egg roll has a nice sweet relish/jam. Recently updated with a veggie frittata, also very good.Atmosphere is laid back and cool, service is always with a smile.Apparently it turns into quite a nice place for a drink at night.Check their opening times in the morning, they open later on weekdays
5
It's very hard to get a good breakfast in Singapore and this is the only place that I got one! The atmosphere is trendy and the staff are very friendly!If you have ever been to Singapore you know they have a lot to learn in the customer service end but in club street social they are brilliant! The Barista is more like a coffee mixologist and great to watch while having your lovely breakfast! I will definitely be back
5
We love this place ! Really chilled out vibe ! Really friendly staff .Best cappuccino without doubt in Singapore ! Love the touch of little ginger biscuit on the side with every coffee. Great breakfasts especially the scrambled eggs and smoked salmon. Great chicken pesto panini .
5
I love this place and visit often both for business and pleasure. The service is fantastic: welcoming, attentive, swift and the food excellent - especially the risotto and steak sandwich.For business, it's close enough to be in Club Street and its surrounds of media land, yet far enough away to be a little more private.The evening ambience changes to a funky bar and with some great cool beers like Boags.A real gem just off club street and highly recommended. I just wish it opened an hour earlier as often meetings start at 10!Keep up the excellent work guys :
3
Always great service and ambiance here, but I was disappointed by the average scrambled eggs and toast and the lukewarm coffee.We had been here before and loved the truffle gnocchi, but it was not on the menu this time. My husband traded it for the chilli con carne which was tasty but oily
4
The scrambled eggs are unbeatable. My chocolate mousse was thick, heavy, and sinful. The Nutella bread pudding is addictive. The Darth Vader blends 80% Arabica with 20% Robusta to make kicking doppio, and well balanced latte. The service was friendly and sharp. It's a nice setting for breakfast and brunch, and a great bar, too
4
I stopped here for a drink after walking around Chinatown. Club Street Social has both indoor and outside seating. The decor is very contemporary. It was very busy during the entire time I was there. However, despite being busy, the staff were extremely friendly and attentive. I did not eat there, but the food looked very good. I would definitely come back the next time that I am in Singapore
5
I've eaten at CSS twice, and have visited for drinks an additional time. I've been quite pleased with all three experiences.Of particular note are the excellent salads (especially the roasted pumpkin & sun dried tomato). Pulling off a great salad in Singapore, where access to good produce is extremely limited, is no small feat.I also appreciate the well priced wines (a decent rose) and beers (Vedette) that go beyond the basic stuff (hi, Tiger and Erdinger) that every other bar in the neighborhood serves.All in all: good food, great drink selection, nice atmosphere, all at a reasonable price. Recommended if you're in the neighborhood

Stopped by with a friend for brunch on Sunday. Ordered the scrambled eggs with fontina & chives. Opted for extras of bacon, pork sausage & mushrooms. Eggs were done nicely, oozy & nice addition of cheese. However the four pale triangles of toast they came with were a disappointment. The smoked sausage I felt wasn't the appropriate accompaniment as a nice meaty English sausage would have worked better. I like my bacon crisp & this wasn't done enough. My friend had the french toast with caramelized banana & no complaints there as she got two thick slices of eggy brioche bread. Service was a little haphazard as simple requests such as for ketchup & an order for a latte were forgotten. The staff were apologetic but in the end , we left without that additional latte. Nice location on Gemmill Lane opposite Luke's & a part of the heating up Club Street/Ann Siang Hill belt
3
The place is nice and in a quiet location off the road of club street. The food is a bit fade and oily and we were a little bit disappointed by the size of the portions... We are more used to bigger brunch plates for this price in Singapore and a bit of fanciness in the presentation of the dishes
4
Club Street Social offers one of the best brunches in Singapore with lovely and yummy selections of cocktails and breakfast. We went there in the morning and all of us were super pleased with the food. We had scramble eggs, french toast, truffled egg toast, pan-seared lobster panini and watermelon salad. All were yummy and looked gorgeous. Atmosphere-wise, it has a vibe of chic and sleek Manhattan feel. All in all, it's a cool place with delish breakfast and chic ambient
5
This is a great little cocktail bar. The menu has some really different cocktails on - all of which are beautifully crafted and made. Most cocktail bars water down their spirits and fill the glasses with ice so you barely get a sip at all and are charged crazy prices. Here they have an amazing selection of premium spirits - many of which I had never heard of - and know about all of them. The will also make any other cocktail you want off the menu and can discuss the flavours and backgrounds of all of them - amazing. This is fab for drinks for any occasion and they do have a food menu which looks good but I did not try. If you like your cocktails made and served by people who know spirits and cocktails and love them, then this is a must go to
4
Today I went to Social for the first and I loved it. From the interior of the place (super high ceilings, mini tiled floor, nice bar & lights), to the service (friendly, personable & fast) and with some nice foods. It was only a late lunch so we didn't eat much. Coffees are good. Lots of iced water during our hour there. Bisque was yummy. Crostini's are not toasted French breads as the waitress suggested but rather factory made Pre packaged slices of toast, bit bland. Goat cheese nice but not very special. Anchovies on the ricotta were nice, not perfect, but not the super salty nasty ones. I'd go back to check out the other dishes for sure. Loved the vibe, want it to be right 
4
Their paninis have to be the best in town! I've tried ALL of them and my all-time favourites are the pan-seared lobster and grilled ribeye. I usually order both and have half and half with a friend so I can have the best of both worlds. The ribeye is generous in size and perfectly cooked while the lobster is a delicious mix of crunch and cream. I tried the lemon tart and was sorely disappointed as it wasn't tart enough. The crust wasn't buttery and flaky enough either. Thankfully, their coffee is pretty good! Service can be touch and go. During lunch when it wasn't so crowded, their staff were friendly and warm. In the evenings, we experienced service that can be considered even quite curt. My recommendation is thus to go during lunch and enjoy the laid-back atmosphere and great design
4
Our second time here. Wonderful setting for a light dinner and wine. The sea bass was very good, with frites and a simple tuna panini with gruyere. The crostini with shrimp was good. Simple wine list, nothing special. The CSS is a nice beginning to an evening in Club St/Duxton Hill
