Thunder tea rice is a novelty for me, after living so many years out of Asia. This new discovery has taken me on a mission to hunt down the dish as often as possible. I've tried a few including the one at Lau Pa Sat and Chinatown, but this version is by far hands down my favourite. The tea is a lot more depth and complexity in the flavours than others. The lady serving was also very sweet and friendly. For $4.50 you get a bowl of brown rice with garnish and a bowl of soup. Healthy and filling, tasty and cheap! It's easy on the wallet, waistline and the conscience if you choose full vegetarian and omit the fried anchovies.The serve breakfast and lunch but not dinner as service stops at around 2.30pm

Saw a queue at this stall and found the menu rather interesting and novel. Decided to give it a try and was SO GLAD I DID. Never tasted such gravy before - refreshing with taste of some assortment of leaves/teas and some nutty texture. The White Rice is definitely not ordinary white rice as there was this fragrant on every bit of rice, they probably did something more to cook it. their specialty beancurd some minced meat was good compliment as the main set comprise of mainly shrimps, vegetables and beancurd. Did not manage to try their organic brown rice. Hope to return if opportunity arises. As the service was rather fast, queue was cleared at pretty decent pace and the server was warmth and friendly
