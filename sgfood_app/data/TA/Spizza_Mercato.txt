Friend and I made our own pastas. The add on ingredients are so great! I had a wholemeal fusilli pasta with pesto sauce and crab meat. Friend had some tomato based sauce with penne and clams. Delish!

Unable to retrieve my reservation. Pizza not as good as it used to be. Staff not attentive.
Will not return

Impressed by their service
Vegetarian pizza was a little salty to our liking. Overall experience is surprisingly good.

one of the best places in singapore to have thin crust pizza at a quiet and cosy restaurant. used the entertainer 1for1 and so the meal costed less than 40 bucks for 3 persons :D

Food and service tops again! Our Favourite gourmet pizza joint. Lasagne is just such a comfort food for us too.
5
Value for money. Tried the spicy salami and pesto chicken pizzas. Loved the spicy flavor but could do with more fresh chilli!

Attempted to come here for lunch today but unfortunately the place appears to have closed completely, with the tables and chairs all gone. The hospitality industry in Singapore is particularly brutal and the high rents don't really help. It's a shame as the pizzas here were really quite decent

@TheKuoKnowsRestaurant chains tend to have a terrible reputation for over-standardising. And that usually means same old, same old. But Spizza Mercato is different - the chain is small enough preserve uniqueness, large enough to matter. Let's hope they keep it small, keep it simple and don't over expand. Spizza's pizzas are delightfully thin. Just enough tomato and cheese, and lashings of toppings. The "Gina" is my favourite. There is nothing quite like anchovies, capers and olives to bring a hint of Italy to Singapore.The lasagna is pipingly morish. It has the magic of Italy written all over it. You can't go too far wrong with a salad, especially after overdosing on carbs and protein. Don't forget to doggy-bag, if you have leftovers.Spizza Mercato at Capitol Piazza gets the thumbs up from me. And hats off also to Perennial and Pontiac for restoring the old Capitol Theatre to its glory days. It brings back fond memories of a misspent youth

Enjoy the yummy food after Broadway Beng!Not crowded, food is good. Order via ipad ... I stil prefer to talk to the service staff - underpass connects to Cityhall MRT/ Raffles City Mall, Swisotel the Stamford, Fairmont Hotel.- beside Peninsula PlazaCapitol Piaza is newly reopened after years of refurbishment and major Reno. Beautiful structur

Decent pizza. But a pity it lacks the omph from a brick oven. Also, they did not update prices on their ipad ordering system, prices are wrong.
4
Booking was easy. Service was excellent. Good quality pastas and pizzas were served. Will go back again. Thanks!
5
Great pasta and pizza, fast service. We loved the ordering via iPad. Good value for money. Took us a while to locate, it's in the basement by the water feature and worth looking for.

Delicious Italian-inspired pizzas with nice variety of toppings.
Restaurant is nice and spacious but not easy to find - a layout issue of the mall.
3
There is a $12 lunch set, which includes any 10" pizza or a dry pasta with a classic sauce. We had the pizza, which was good value.
4
Always impressed with Spizza. The food can even beat some of the pricier Italian restaurants. Prices are sensible too.
5
We order several different dishes and they all tasted amazing to me. I particularly loved the seafood pasta as they took my request of increasing the spiciness level, which made the pasta taste even more delicious. It also had the right consistency and the shrimps were cooked to perfection

Popped in here earlier in the week to address a craving I had for a pizza, and in particular a Parma ham pizza. There are only 2 on the menu with Parma ham: I chose one of them and was very satisfied. Quite fast service too. Great value at lunch at only $12++

We love the extensive menu of pasta, pizza, soup, salads , vegetarian, gluten free options. anyone with a preferred diet can dine here. Food quality is good. Aglio olio was spicy, crab meat linguine was my favourite in this restuarant. Pizza magarita is a nice as sharing dish. Overall a good deal at sgd33 per hea
5
booking via Chope was a breeze. food was ordered thru the ipad.we had the lasagna, 2 pizzas and pasta of the Month - Duck Ragout. All 4 dishes are tasty. Piping hot and fresh. Pizza crust is crispy. (no fanciful service as it was at 5:30pm on a Sunday, no crowd
5
The food was great and the ambience was perfect. Would definitely go back again. The QUINTA pizza and Calamari has got to be my favourites!
5
Manager is really friendly and good. My toddler dropped the cup and he immediately replaced 1 for her. Pizza is great too. Awesome service
5
The restaurant is hard to find...way down in B2. The ambiance is not stellar, but the food and service were both exceptional and a decent wine list.
5
We had dinner there a couple of times, each time we have had good service and excellent food. Enjoyed ourselves.
3
First time here. Easily accessed. Food was not impressive though. Quite and comfortable environment.
4
We tried to design our own pastas and 1 of the service crew (manager) came back to us to advise our orders as she afraid that our pasta combination was too meaty. Good product knowledge and serving guests with good thoughts! Rare gem.
4
The pizzas were good. Rivoli and Lasagne were good too. Comfortable & nice atmosphere for dinner with friends. Service has room for improvements
4
it was good to see the menu including gluten free pasta and fresh pasta. both are uncommon in Singapore. "Create own pasta" was a great idea. Menu was very extensive. Pizza was also nice and thin crusted. Service staff seemed to be shorthanded. They should consider hiring more staff during peak hours
4
Name of the restaurant suggests that they are likely to serve pizza, which isn't inaccurate, but they do serve pastas as well. Regardless, my friends and I were only interested in the pizza. On the menu, pizzas are all given a female name, and while I can't remember if my friends had Vittoria or Gina, I chose to go for the Pizza of the Day/Week which was a pizza with duck meat. Overall, we were very satisfied by the quality and the affordability of our choices and would strongly recommend Spizza to anyone looking for a respectively pizzeria
1
Went there as the restaurant advertised gluten free pizza, but when we got there we were told the following: 'As we inform guests on our website you are required to book 3 days ahead if you want a gluten free dough'. We double checked the website and it didn't. Also, who plans ahead to have pizza 3 days in advance? Spizza Mercato, you have to try harder or clarify that you simply can't deliver on this account.

Was out for dinner with my hubby and two boys.. Their seafood pasta was fantastic ... Fresh pasta, fresh seafood ... My boys enjoyed their kids meal too ... This will be our regular hangout !
3
Pizza with very little toppings. Not value for money in my opinion. And the restaurant ran out of tiramisu on a early weekend night!
3
located at less crowded Capitol Pizza. Love the environment.
The restaurant manager very friendly even though we use the Groupon Voucher.
But the waiter quite bad attitude. Maybe he not in mood that day.

This is a modern-authentic Italian pizzeria with good quality pizzas to choose from a rather extensive menu. My 2 visits here have resulted in gastronomical pleasure and I'm looking forward to a third visit! In addition to their pizzas, they have a small retail section of Italian crockery & ingredients. Very conveniently located just across the road from City Hall MRT as well.

The pizzas here are all named after female names.Good selection of flavours and done thin crust which is to my liking.I ordered TARA, came with mushrooms, cheese, tomato, egg and bacon.Generous helping of bacon and mushrooms.The pasta was done al-dente, we ordered linguine Carbonara. The cream was a little too rich but hey with the generous serving of bacon, I can't be complaining

I have been to this pizza restaurant 5 times in the past year and Spizza Mercato has never failed to impress me with their consistent standards in providing quality food and service.The pizzas are delicious, flavourful and come with generous toppings. The pastas are also yummy, and I recommend their signature crabmeat pasta.The staff are also warm and attentive, refilling our iced waters frequently and greeting all customers with a smile. During my visit on Saturday, 6 Feb 2016, my companion had his cutlery promptly replaced when he accidentally dropped it on the floor. As his first time visit to Spizza Mercato, he was impressed by the great service.The restaurant also has a lovely ambience, perfect for a memorable date with loved ones. I will continue to patronise Spizza Mercato as a regular customer, and will recommend this restaurant to everyone. :

The service was top notch. The manager was very nice and accommodating to my friend who had a baby. They provided hot water for her to warm her milk bottle and were willing to provide more hot water to warm the bottle when it became cold.In addition to that, while we were eating, he also helped to take care of the baby for us! We will definitely go back to dine there again

staff were very friendly and accommodating. went around 2:30pm so not crowded and relatively quiet. food was served quickly - ordered the pesto chicken pizza. it was a good size for 2 people to share and was warm and crisp as if Just out of the oven! very good amount of shredded chicken (not too dry either which i was slightly afraid of). could have possibly added more veg on top but otherwise tasted great!area was nice and clean with a decent little selection of groceries, books, kitchenware to browse and purchase at the front of the store

I would give it 5 stars for service. Staff are terrific. The pizza disappoints because the crust edges are not puffy and crisp, just somewhat soggy and flavorless. The specks, and I mean like barely visible, of basil are offensive. Why not place six to eight whole basil leaves on it? It IS a Marguerita pizza, afterall.My husband enjoyed his wine and I liked the Italian beer.The waiter was kind and appropriately attentive. I like that they sell Italian kitchen items and food products from Italy. Sadly, the pizza is disappointing as I am Italian. This is the Spizza at Capital Plaza. Have not tried other venues.

I think the dining experience here mostly depends on what you order. My husband and I dined here last week and had slightly different views. We had burratina and a mini julianna pizza for starters. The salad and pizza were good. For main course I had a spinach ravioli in tomato sauce while my husband had a mixed seafood pasta. The pasta was good while the ravioli was a bit doughy. Also, the tomato sauce for ravioli was a bit too acidic for my palate and had a weird artificial red colour. I love Italian food and have dined at numerous restaurants but never have I seen that kind of a red colour. For dessert we had the tiramisu which was huge and maybe could have tasted better but had a lot of ice crystals. The strawberry slice on top was very sour. So overall I would say an average experience.
