Its a very nice place - nice because the Pita is super fresh! Ofcourse the ambience is nothing to boast about, its a food court like environment, hence a place to sit is difficult to come by.

The chicken sharwarma, salad, humus and warm pita bread was very tasty and fresh. The tiny food court had a funky feel to it. Great find, especially if you don't want to eat saucy or deep fried food
