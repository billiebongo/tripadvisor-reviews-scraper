Casual and beautiful area when I went during dinner time. The pizza is baked using wood fire . I can there are mostly family sitting around tables.
2
Good cocktail but service not good after being told to pay bill very quickly. I have seen better service elsewhere in Singapore, London and elsewhere in the world.
4
Added chilli to the salami pizza for a real treat, good setting on the beach and great oven cooked pizzas
3
Itâ€˜s okay for a quick and casual bit to eat in the evening. The atmosphere was bit too casual, so was the service. Food was average.
5
Genuinely good Italian food at Sentosa Island , Singapore!
Great service and food, good wine selection, comfortable undercover outdoor seating , we thoroughly enjoyed our meals .
A hidden gem !
3
I know I m italian so it is difficult to have high ranking pizza when you are abroad even if tra pizza is not bad. igrediends are good in particular tomato sauce the price is expensive but you know you are in sentosa
5
Our favourite place to eat on Sentosa. Food is always prepared quickly. Large servings and value for money. Love, love, loved it.
5
Since we were staying at Shangri-La Rasa Resort & Spa, this was so convenient. The ambience of a beach bar / cafe was simply one-up. You must have the pizza's' here. You can come here in the eve for a few drinks, or even for lunch and cool of with the beer / juices, etc
4
A tidy little eatery which is a walk from the Shangri-La and therefore you are able to book to your room which is a plus. We went quite late in the evening and so it was not that busy and the atmosphere was peaceful with a good view
5
Stopped for a bite to eat whilst my boyfriend went on the zip line, very friendly service in a busy environment. Pizza was tasty and fresh, made in a big pizza oven. Nice views of the beach from the restaurant, and not too pricey either! The smoothies are delicious
4
We ate lunch here after a long day at Sentosa Island and were very happy with the food and the service.
The server was very particular about our dietary restrictions.
The pizza was delicious.
5
Awesome Food and Service! Service staff were very attentive and love the place that is situated by the beach front!
3
Good location, very good salads, pizza (as normally outside Italy) not very crispy and one minute too short time in the owen.
4
Everything was good for food, values, service, and atmosphere! If I visit Singapore again, I would like to visit once again.

Trapizza has a nice location. That you can't deny. With the view of the beach and sitting under/near the palm trees. Nice!The ambiance, however, cannot compensate for two major flaws: poor service and a disgusting bathroom.The service was a combination of absent staff (where were they when we needed them) + poor communication (we wanted to ask about the bill ; the waiter thought we were asking for the bill, which was already on the table) + below par attitude (smile a bit more, guys!)The bathroom was just plain nasty. Singapore has great public bathrooms (try one your nearby MRT station) so I know the standard is high but this one was really not acceptable. You need to make a better effort on that part! There's also a playground in the corner but after dark it gets very .... dark. Consider installing a lamp or something.And I almost for got about one last thing: the food. I would say just average with ok but not great pricing, which is to be expected as the overheads of any business on Sentosa must be sky-high.
4
The prices reflect that you are on Sentosa island and you are on the beach, so expect to pay top dollar for food and drinks. Saying that, the chips we had were fresh and crispy and a good size portion and the salad was good an tasty. We hogged the table for some time just enjoying the location and cold beer and they didn't mind bringing us cold water as we sat there (the place was not overly busy)
5
After visiting the SEA Aquarium we ventured across to Sentosa Beach for lunch. We'd heard good things about Trapizza and it lived up to its positive reviews. In addition to canopies for shade there's plenty of fans to keep you cool on a hot day, and the drinks are really cold (not always the case in Singapore). The pizza is truly outstanding - our young children absolutely devoured it! Wonderful service, and well priced. Highly recommended
4
An outdoor dining venue that I found out about due to it being near the Shangri-La's Rasa Resort. Can't get it delivered to your room tho. About a 1km walk across the beach from hotel, not sure about the cleanliness of outdoor dining in Singapore, a place that is very hot & humid all year round. The food is reasonably priced with a real good selection. Some video games and scenery to keep you occupied whilst you wait for food. The food was good, generally pretty oily pastas tho, not al dente cooked pasta either. Tiny salad too. All gave just a bit of heartburn. Alright tho and I would go back to try the pizzas because it didn't take long for food to be ready.
5
Nice restaurant on the beach at Sentosa. Price will be between 19 and 30SGD for a main. They have beer and wine at a normalPrice for Singapore. The quality of the pizza is very good for a beach restaurant and you have your feet in the sand. Kids can go play and you can relax sipping your beer (not bad). Service was very good on a Friday evening. Nice walk on the beach to digest your pizza :-) If you drive, the restaurant is part of the Shangri-la hotel next door so you have free parking :-) ( not other parking close by)! Enjoy
5
We had a lovely midweek dinner on the beach here, with kids. Location, location, location! Indeed it does matter! Few steps from the beach, few steps from bus stop and station. Pizza was fantastic. Very much like the thin and crispy crust. Kids were entertained by some wild life roaming around and also by slides and sand, and sand toys.
5
This was a big surprise to us.We thought this would be a simple cafe style restaurant with basic food. The restaurant is certainly casual but the food was really excellent. Great pizza and risotto.
3
We had the 4 cheese pizza and the linguine with seafood and were pleasantly surprised with the food. Move along if you're looking for an authentic Italian experience straight out of Tuscany, but for what it is- decent.
4
stopped here just for drinks service was very good great in the day and at nite food looked great what we saw so we orderd some quick hot and nice no problem
4
Very nice and crispy thin pizza. Watched the sun going down ðŸ˜€ over sentosa beach.
Although the island was full of party guests (family event at Siloso, Indian party, etc.) there was still the chance to get a nice table)
4
Fantastic Pizza, like in Italy! Very friendly and proactively people. Price was totally ok and our child could play outside.
5
A wonderful place to sit and have lunch near a lovely beach on Sentosa Island.
Tasty food, well presented and friendly staff.
4
Quite noisy in v day. Food a little too exp. ambience wasnt as romantic as we thought. Clearly understaffed
3
Went to Trapizza on our first evening during our stay at the Shangri-La. Whilst the location is very nice (directly on the beach), i was rather disappointed by the food (especially the Pizza i had, i think the seafood pasta was ok). Not really an Italian
3
ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right on the beach so can be great for drinks and the view. I had ravioli and it was ok, with a lot of good mushrooms, but seemed to have a lot of added salt and sugar. I also had a chocolate dessert dish that was very good
5
We brought our 16 months baby to the siloso beach to let her play with beach sands. And we were just finding a place to avoid the sunlight and to eat something. The pizza at Trapizza was far more than just filling our stomach during the beach play, it was really nice. We loved it. Also it was not crowded even at Saturday afternoon, so we left our stuff at the table to take some photos at the beach and come back
5
We stayed at the Rasa Sentosa Resort and dined her on a number of ocassions. A good selection of food on the menu. The quality of food was excellent, the service was excellent as was the excellent and very friendly staff.
5
Food was excellent, great view especially during sunset. Not too crowded since it is located at the end of siloso beach
4
After a long day at universal studio with the kids; it is a treat to get a pizza at Trapizza. They are good as l I like them with a very thin crest. The service is efficient and nice
3
Different kinds of pizza and pasta. Nice for families because they have a small playground for kids, and have kids utensils, plates and cups for them.
5
A very lovely Trapizza experience, it is amazing, the mango Juice is divine and pizza is amazing and delicious!
5
I had a good experience at this place. I was celebrating my wife's birthday there and I got a small cake from them. The staff are very attentive and the food served were good.
2
We ate dinner here one night as we were staying at the Shangrila-La. We ordered the ribs and they were so tough as to be inedible. We ordered other items as well, but I wanted to just call attention to the ribs. Do yourself a favor and avoid this dish. The staff were kind and attentive. I think this restaurant is overpriced, but it is not atypically priced for its location
1
We were served the full 3 course meal all within 20 minutes, all the food was brought out together and because the restaurant was outside got cold very quickly which meant that we left most of the meal. Very disappointed we wanted a night out and it was all over within 20 minutes, Restaurant very expensive belonging to a 5 star hotel so should have done a lot better
5
The perfect beach restaurant to have hot wood stoned thin crust pizza, a lot of variety for veggies also, kids can play in the nearby small play area while the couples and families can enjoy the food. Its an open restaurant very airy and relaxing. Going to visit again for sure.Dont miss the $10 wine glass, which is huge :
4
The main draw of this place to me is the setting. Rather than being cooped up in a traditional restaurant, this place is al fresco under a big tent. We were fortunate we went on a cool nite so it was wonderful. I wont say this is a fine dining place so you can dress casually. Food is great and they do a pretty nice ribs as well
4
Pizza are great if you like fine Base.
I enjoy eating in the sand but you Nedd to book as they have only few tables in the sand
4
Great place for families with young kids. The manager was very helpful and accomodating. We preferred the pasta dishes to the pizzas. Overall, we had a good time and will definitely be back.
4
Nice restaurant right on the beach. Busy. Good pizza and salads. Close to the Shangri La Rasa Hotel.
4
Came here for an evening meal with the kids. They played on the beach while we drank champagne, then the pizzas arrived and we all enjoyed them.
Lovely.
3
Nice setting right on the beach and the staff/service was very good and fast too. The food itself was quite bland - we got two different types of pizza and they tasted pretty much the same. It was also quite expensive for what it was but we've come to expect that so far in Singapore
3
For the food and location, this is a solid 4 out of 5. Nice Italian variety, kids will love the pizza. Lovely, relaxing location when weather is nice. Service was not very good. I can live with slow when place is busy, I can't accept waitresses who are simply grumpy, ignore you when you call them and feel as they are forced to be there. This alone brings it down a star, I recognize we may just have been unlucky that day , but that's our only visit (for a reason
4
Enjoyed a very relaxing pizza by the beach here on Sentosa at Siloso Point. So much so I missed my last cable car back to mainland Singapore.Good selection of Italian dishes - excellent pizza which you can watch being cooked in an open oven in the kitchen. Service is fast and friendly. Settled on a margarita pizza and tiramisu for dessert. Relaxed, informal and nice food - not overly expensive and certainly a cheaper option than Rasa Hotel next to the restaurant if your staying there. I was there in the evening so there was a cooling breeze, however day time I guess it could be quite warm there. In short - great pizzas by the beach!!
4
Visited Trapizza with 4 people and used the offered combo meal: 2 mains+jug of drink = 51 SGD for two persons. Was worth every single dollar.Yum pizzas and pasta and a very nice and helpful waiter (cannot remember his name though).Service was quick, food yum, price not too bad (when you consider that a jug of drink was 18 SGD when you didnt use the combo meal offer!). Would we go there again? Yes
4
I think the title says it all - a great place for families that want to kick back a little bit while the kids play on the beach right in front of the restaurant. They also have a playground were kids can play on slides, climb around, etc. Most indicated to families with kids between 1 and 8 years old. Food is slightly above average with fair prices and service needs quite a bit of improvement. Go early as it tends to get crowded after 6.30pm, especially in the weekends
3
Great pizzas, not wood fired but tasted great. Good location on the beach, nice when the sun goes down. Cocktails were terrible, super sweet and watery. The poor staff are run off their feet and consequently it has an effect on customer service and customer experience. It's part of Shangrila hotel so it surprises me why there isn't more staff. On the positive side the pizzas are good and it's an easy family eatery. Negative side is lack of staff and cocktails
5
We visited here on our last day in Singapore.
Great service from the staff even though it was busy.
Food coming out looked incredible.
Bottle of wine was reasonably priced for Singapore.
4
If you are wanting something easy, fast and filling come here. No frills, just basic good food. The kids loved having a play on the beach with the kids from other tables.
5
A large variety of traditional pizza and pasta and salads and also a gluten free option for those that need it. Friendly staff and quick service with delicious food.
5
The pizzas are always amazing here we always have pizza from here when in Sentosa and highly recommend it. Great location walking distance from Shangrila-La
5
LOVED the pizza here. We ordered the prosciuttio pizza with arugula. Everything about it - the toppings, crust, sauce- was on point. Ate here a total of three times during our wknd staying right next to the Shangri-La.
1
If you are coming here expecting staff to be attentive or even vaguely show any interest in customers, service or your order - you are in the wrong place ...
4
It's located on the beach near the trapeze. I took a cable car down not sure how long the walk is but can imagine it would feel longer with the heat and would be exhausting.Great place for pizzas and something different to have on a beach as u don't normally get to have pizzas on a beach.
4
Since Sentosa island is such a touristy place, and I am going to only visit south part of Sentosa, I had very limited choices for lunch. I figured this would be ok for my family with toddler. It is located right at the beach, so the view is lovely. Even with sun shine, it was not very hot to sit outside (they don't have inside seat which I didn't know before I get there). We tried pizza de mare and pasta arrabiata with fries & mozzarella sticks. The food was adequate and mango juice was nice to cool us down. They also had a small play area in front of the restaurant for little ones, which was nice. Overall for the price, it was not a bad choice
3
We we staying at the Shangri La and thus went there. Its a short walk from the hotel on the "boardwalk." I rated it average as the food was just that, average, and service was really slow [we were the only table there on that particular afternoon]. The experience was not bad, but I think it could have been better with attentive service
1
We stopped here for a drink but didn't stay long. The staff had something else on their minds. After eventually taking our order (there were only 2 other tables occupied at 2pm) they finally served everyone except my husband who ordered a beer. When we had all finished our drinks he went to the bar to pay and the insisted he pay for his beer and take it away in a plastic cup after it had been on the bar for 15mins..
2
We were not impressed by the prices here - a kids meal for $18 ++ that was kids' nuggets and did not include chips!!!! Find somewhere that is better value.
3
Ordered a jug of Tiger draught, Family fries and Spicy wings.
The fries are indeed huge in portion, probably good to share among 4.
The Spicy wings are mid-joint chicken wings, 8 pieces
Price slightly below SGD80
4
We went as an extended family and the place was crowded for a weekday. Service staff was eager and attentive, reflecting the Shangri-la''s. Food was served promptly and piping hot which can be a challenge in today''s context, especially in an outdoor environment. Despite the sweltering weather, staff was always full of smile though you can sense the inexperience.We did not expect top notch Italian but areally well satisfied wit it's value
3
2 adults, 3 pre teen kids , spent $942 X 600ml beer, 2 pizzas and 1 cheese sticks ( light dinner) You come here because you like eating by the beach.The beach is 2 meters from our table. A small playground for younger children (1-7years ideal). Is ok to dress in Tee and shorts or your bikinis. Come before sunset to enjoy the mood. Ambience :8/10 do ask for the table closest to beach . Service :7/10 . Is ok....young staff with reasonable service manners. ( this is under the Shangrila group ....) Food : 6.5/10 I like the thin cheese pizza (under snack) at $10.20. Fries were half cold and half hot. I do wish restaurants learn NOT to serve the half portion of cold fries at all.....Overall is nothing amazing nor bad....P.s. We have been here for about 10 times in last 6 years or so
3
The food was quite good actually - fresh salad, solid pasta. But a VERY family environment - which is misleading from the description on the Shangri La app and website which makes it sound right on a peaceful beach. On the beach - yes; peaceful - no. In fact a jungle gym and child play area separates the dining tables from the beach. Give the food 4 stars but overall a 3 because I was not with child :-
3
It may have an Italian name and menu but you know their chef is not Italian. It's average Italian food you find everywhere. It's okay if you don't want to travel far from your hotel. The outdoor sitting is good for kids to walk around and play. There is a slide too.
4
We had the NiÃƒÂ§oise salad, grilled prawns with pasta and pizza. The food was decent, pizza crust was crispy, pasta was al dente and tasty. This restaurant is children friendly in that they have a kids menu and a few play structures for children to play while waiting for the food to arrive. The only gripe I had was they used cheap and badly scratched ikea plastic utensils for kids
4
Located by Siloso Beach in Sentosa, Trapizza offers affordable Italian cuisine right next the beach. I ordered the carbonara, which was a pretty decent portion for the price. The desserts are also pretty good, I had the tiramisu. Do check it out if you happen to be at Siloso Beach for the day
4
Situated on the beach, but part of the nearby Shangri La Rasa Sentosa restort, this is nice place to eat if you're either visitng the beach or just want to get away from tne main resort for a while.Fast, efficient service, very thin, crispy pizza, and a fair choice of toppings and other menu items. A little on the pricey side due to its connection with the resort though
3
The crust is thin and crispy as advertised but it's a little tasteless. They claim it to be a wood fired oven. I suggest it's a gas fired oven and they occasionally put some wood in there. Absolutely no wood fired taste. The tomato sauce on the pizza was nice with it being traditionally prepared with only tomato. Good quality meats for toppings too.The best part of it is the little play area for the kids and the proximity of the beach. Kept the kids happy once they finished eating
5
This is a great restaurant serving amazing Italian food at reasonable prices. Located outdoors on the beach, it has play equipment for the kids and a wonderful sunset.
4
Very good Italian food with very moderate price. But beware to go in a rainy day as the restaurant is outside the hotel and you have to walk for about 7 minutes.
4
Had a cocktail after a long (and partly rainy) day on Sentosa. Nice location on the beach next to underwater world. Pizzas are prepared in a wood oven and looking good - what I could see on the neighbor's table
1
From looking at the pictures online this retaurant looked like a lovely romantic spot to eat on the beach. Its actually about 500m away from the hotel, bright florecent lights, kids playground and no real restaurant vibe. My partner and I were very disappointed.
4
Good place, lovely location especially if you have kids.
The food is a bit expencive and the quality is not great, but overall not too bad.. Ideal for long lunches and chilled afternoon.. We will come back.
4
Very nice and simple meal on on the beach with a bottle of wine, reasonably priced and staff very attentive, short walk from Rasa Sentosa
2
Was looking forward to eating here whilst staying at the shangri la and went on our first night. Ordered 2 sets of kids nuggets meals and what came out was 2 plates of about 6 nuggets and nothing else (well except some tomato sauce that appeared to have been watered down). For $15++ I expect more than a couple of fried nuggets and an ice cream. Adults meals were small but quite tasty but I can't get over those nugget
5
What a setting!! On the beach with glorious views, hot sunshine and romantic ambience! Have visited several times before and it never disappoints. Ice cold beer, friendly service albeit it a bit slow, wonderful pizzas and salads and just a totally brilliant place to relax and chill out. Tables and everything all basic but you are on the beach, so its all about the location and fun
5
My family and I dined in this restaurant 2 times over the weekend during our staycation.Food: Pizza Aloha, chicken wings and Spaghetti Aglio Olio will delicious. Pizza is the highlight. Tiger prawns with pasta is a little too oily for my liking. Ambience: Nice outdoor sitting, breezy for both lunch and dinner. Only con: Rattan chair left an imprint on my thighs as I wore shorts!Spent about SGD70 including a nice cocktail.
5
It was a rainy day and we were checked in at Shangri-La Rasa Resort. As the family craved for pizza, we were pleasantly surprised that we can take the hotel buggy to their pizza joint located outside the hotel and along the beach. The setting was cozy with friendly staff. For dinner, we had calamari, pizza stagioni, lagsana and beer. The calamari was crunchy and chewy. My son who normally hates it as it is rather hard to chew was fighting with the adults over it. The oven-baked pizza Stagioni was served with each portion consisting of different ingredients - parma ham, olives, mushrooms and salami. It was delicious with the thin crust and each of us go for what we like best without the hassle of picking of certain ingredients that we don't like. My son and hubby loved the lagsana which was very generous with its ingredients. The whole meal was topped off with beers and ice lemen tea (for the kiddo). We went back the following day for a hearty lunch with my sister. This time we had the same dishes plus Linguine Vongole. The linguine was good. Not too oily nor spicy. For drinks, we went for a bucket of 5 and apple juice. For both visits, the service was impeccable and though it is hotel-owned, the prices are reasonable! We had a good time and will definite visit again as it is already in my son's makan list!
4
Nice Italian selection - their pizzas were divine - thin crispy base - yummy - One who does not eat pizza normally enjoyed this one. Top marks.
4
Lovely location on the beach. Fans were blowing to keep things cool and comfortable. Had a play section for the kiddies well away from those that didn't have young children. Excellent service and great pizzas.
5
A short walk on the beach and easy going relaxed staff, Trapizza offers good pizzas and pasta dishes along with refreshing drinks. Good for a casual bite to eat
5
We tried many different pizza places in singapore and then we stayed at Shangri-La Sentosa and came across Trapizza and WOW I'm glad we did it was so yummy and well priced we will eat here again for sure
4
Relatively good food if you don't want to venture too far out of the Shangri La resort, but pricey! Reasonable western food Pizza and the likes. Drinks containing alcohol weren't cheap either.
3
Arriving at our hotel on the 2nd November the first night we thought why not let's try Trapizza as this restaurant would have something our three year old daughter would like and being Italian themed should be delicious, Our first dining experience was great, as soon as we arrived at the counter we were greeted by the staff, seated and ordered straight away, they even accommodated for our daughter making her a bowl of pasta, which was lovely, service was fantastic.Came back three nights later and a totally different experience, no one came to seat us for nearly five minutes, after showing us to a table, we sat there after viewing the menus waiting to be served drinks and to have our order taken for over ten minutes and still no one served us, it was not a busy night the restaurant was not even half full.Such a disappointment we got up and left and didn't come back again
5
We had lunch and dinner here whilst staying at Shangra La. Our multi generational group of 23 was really impressed with both the food and the service. Location on the beach is great and service was fantastic - they went out if their way to seat our large group even when we rocked up with no booking.Ther was not one complaint from anyone in our group about their food (a combination of pizza, pasta and main courses)Would definitely recommend Trapizza when visiting Sentosa
5
My family ate here twice recently while staying at the Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa (less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel). The food is very good. My kids loved it. I tried the Aloha Pizza, Pepperoni Pizza, Carbonara Pasta, and a couple of appetizers. Everything was very good. Although quite busy, the staff was courteous and the service was rather quick. For lunch, I did not make a reservation, but I am glad I did for dinner, since it was quite full. The atmosphere here is also good, since the place sits right on the Siloso Beach. This place is convenient for those staying at the Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa, sknce one can charge the price of the meal to one's room. All in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone in Sentosa.
1
Sunday 16/8/2015. It was my nephew last night in Singapore as he is returning to Japan the next morning. A friend recommended me for pizzas there as I was thinking of bringing him to HRC. Firstly the pizzas are not great which I was surprised since the name seemed linked to somehow great pizza place. Secondly the service really bad, they forgotten our sphagetti, reminded them twice and lastly they were rushing us to finished our dinner as they seemed to have a party later on and it was supposed to be a slow dinner till 10pm, but we finished at 9pm because they switched off the music and were clearing the tables!! I have been to several Shangri-la, this Restuarant had to be the worst. I definitely won't visit it again. To the management reading this, please do something, Tripadvisor has several comments on poor CS, and I didn't believe it till I visited myself!! For me to pay 250 dollars for pizzas is absolutely fine but quality and great experience counts too.
5
We ate here a few times and found the food to be great. It was great that they catered for kids and included a kids menu as well as a play area for them. Added bonus is it is close to the Shangri-la Rasa Sentosa and is on the beach. A let down though is the staff, there is not enough to cater for the numbers coming through the restaurant. Also this is the first restaurant I have been to that I have had to write down my own order on a piece of paper and give to the waiter, that's a bit different
4
Had lunch here last week. Food was good, quickly presented and reasonably priced (for the location).
Lots of local eat here which is a good sign. Can also room charge if staying at Shangri-La
4
Good location and reasonably priced. Quick service too. We had ordered and received our meal within 15 mins and the pizza was tasty with a crispy base.
4
Not only were the pizzas delicious but so were the salads & the ribs. Beautiful views especially at night.
2
Great staff but very disappointing pizza. If this is the second best restaurant on the island, we're in trouble!
4
Great view of the water although the harbor is filled with commercial ships. Beach access, easy walk from Rasa Sentosa. Kiddie play area for toddlers. Good food & drink selection, good service. A good break from the hotel buffet food.
4
Great place to chill. Pizza is nice! Rack of lamb cooked to perfection with very delicious veg. Interestingly - fried herb on it tasted great! Staff put on friendly smiles and happy orders! The playground for the kids is very thoughtful. Will be great for family dining!
2
If your expecting a pizza like in Australia don't get one from here. Pretty much pita bread tomato paste and cheese is there version of margarita. Over price and the chairs leave major marks on the backs of your legs. Mmmmmm I wouldn't maybe try the pasta!!!
3
We have now visited Sentosa Island a number of times and have also eaten here on numerous occasions previously so thought we would return as previously have found it to be a very good place. Good location with seating with views to the water. Menu remains limited with pizza, pasta and some salads and drinks menu also limited. Prices are high and for two people you would pay at least $80-$90 Aud and that is for one course and one drink each. This time around we found the staff to be more concerned about talking to one another than assisting customers with orders and meals, and we ate here twice in one week and both times found this time be the same, and in fact, saw a number of people come in and sit down, read menus and then not have their orders taken so they left again and walked up the road. So....... For the price you pay, better off catching the mono rail to Vivocity and eat with locals on the lower levels, less than $10 for great noodles or rice meals
3
Veggie pizza (pizza verdure) is great. The spicy Pasta arabiatta is also tasty. My favourite is jug of juice - mango and lemonade being the favourite. Service is inconsistent. I have had to wait long to be seated on most occasions, even though seats are available and staff is doing nothing busy. Staff typically do come near you after serving, have to try hard to get their attention. Tomato bruschetta we ordered as starter was served after our meal was over like a dessert.
3
We cam here a few times as we were staying in the hotel nearby and wanted to get out (this was the closest by and linked for payment so we just came here for convenience). The setting and view was fantastic but the restaurant nothing special in terms of dÃƒÂ©cor or ambiance.The service was great and there were a few slides and houses for children to play in which kept our little one happy. The menu however was very much pizzas and pastas with limited drinks on offer and the prices were sky high. We had a main meal each (2 people), plus a beer and some water and it cost over 120 dollars!!! We didn't dwell on it at the time, and food was nice, but if I had more knowledge of the area (and didn't have a 2 year old ready for bed) I would definitely look elsewhere for variety and value
5
If you wanna hangout with your friends and you're in sentosa! Head down to the end of Siloso beach you will see trapizza! Great place to chill, eat & have a great time! Not to mention you get to see beautiful sunset if you're there!
4
a great place to stop off whilst walking the beach. Great choice of menu. Great staff and very reasonable prices.
5
Eaten here 5 times in the past 8 days and the service and food is great. Right on the beach. Great way to enjoy a meal in a beautiful surrounding
5
They have a nice pizza really I like it , we spend a great time in front of the beach , staffs were welcoming all the time and smiling as well.
4
I liked the food as it was delicious but I disliked it that the food took quite long to arrive and the waiters could not really speak proper English so it was a little hard to understand them.
5
Very nice resataurant on the beach. If you stay in Shagri La Sentosa no cash needed - meals could be charged to your room. Good selection of pizzas - we liked special pizzas the best. Child menu very good.
3
We landed up at Siloso Beach and were looking for a place to eat. We saw this shack like pizza place and went to order a pizza. A veg pizza here cost 22.10 SGD and was full of flour powder :)my wife ended up with quite a bit of powder on her face. However the taste was awesome....The location rocks, and the views were lovely..

we had dinner here a couple of times during our stay. The selection of food was good, but the location is what makes dining here worth while. You are right on Siloso Beach, and there is plenty for kids and adults to do nearby. Excellent service
4
Difficult to get a booking. Tried through the Credit Card Life Style Services but to no avail, was promised to be on top of the waitlist. Called directly and after I told them that we were staying at the Rasa Sentosa they gave us a place. On the day of dinner arrived at the restaurant to find there was no waiting and some tables were empty. Either the restaurant keeps tables for the guests at the hotel or not accepting reservations make them look busy and wanted.The restaurant is located under several canopys, in a quiter area, open air, fitted with fans thus comfortable, next to the beach, there is a play areas for the kids. Italian food, good taste, portions are big, two persons can eat from one. The staff did give us good advice on the portions. Overall an enjoyable experience, service was excellent

After doing the megazip adventure park we were looking for somewhere for lunch and this place had a great menu plus was rite on the beach.It was very quiet when we went and we had a pizza each which was lovely and a few mocktails. The service was prompt and enough time given to chose your food. Was a lovely setting sitting on the beach watching people inthe water or on the beach.Would defo recommend and come back again
3
The food is pretty basic but pizzas were Ok and not too expensive considering it is right on a popular beach.
5
Brilliant food and location - we ate here a few times over our week on Sentosa. Great staff and great outlook !!
4
For a pizza restaurant the food is average and nothing special. The kids loved it and there are things to keep the little ones entertained too. Service was good.
4
Really nice beach setting. Go and have a meal or pizza and watch the sun set. Family friendly and very casual.
3
Casual beach dining with children's playground attached.Good for the kids to run around.Menu was fine,service was OK too but perhaps it was a little bit pricey for what you got.
4
We enjoyed this restaurant, the pizza and pasta was nice, and they also have a kids menu. High chairs are available, and also there is an outdoor play area for younger kids and arcade machines indoors for the older kids.The seating area outside is covered and on the beach, so nice setting.We went early so it was quiet, and staff were very friendly, food was delivered quickly. A main, dessert and drink for the two of us plus a kids meal cost SGD$90, which is on par with all the options in this area. For cheaper alternatives head to Vivo City, there is a free shuttle bus if staying at the Shangri-La
3
We ate here for dinner two nights in a row. Staff were friendly and helpful and spoke English very well. Pizzas are great, all thin crust, and the Salads also quite good, and all meals were on the table very promptly and fresh /hot.The menu consists of mainly pizzas and pastas, with some salads and snacks and they do offer children's meals. Prices for mains are between $14 and $25 . We had a tiramisu for dessert and would suggest that you give this a miss as it came in a small square bowl, and as small as the serve was, it was also not overly fresh. The venue is in a great location right on the beach and ceiling fans are on in e outdoor area. Worth a visits as the environment is a bit more relaxing and quiet then the venues further up the road.
3
We felt like a light inexpensive meal while staying at Shangri-La and found this to be a nice, easy experience and a change of pace being very casual / relaxed atmosphere. Would be perfect for dining with young children.The pizza was basic, but light and delicious - exactly what I felt like on the night
5
Fantastic location and view!!The food is quite simple, but is well cooked and tasty. Our son had the spaghetti bolognaise and my husband and I shared a pizza and garlic bread. Serving sizes were HUGE...was very glad we let our son do the trapeze before dinner!!! Staff at both the restaurant and the trapeze were awesome. Special mention going out to the staff at the trapeze who did such a great job with our seven year old son who was a bit nervous on his first ever trapeze swing
4
On the beach just a short walk from the Rasa Sentosa Resort. Gets busy so you may have to wait for a table.Great range of wood fired pizzas and nice salads too.Service is a little slow, but food makes up for it.Expensive but as per hotel dining you need to expect that
4
Took the kids and you fill in the order yourself which made it much more efficient - just don't expect food to come in any particular order, when its ready - it comes. We went back twice as we liked it. Reasonable value for money.
4
Nice foods, but little too long to wait for our tables, cause only few waitress, too many customers I guess. But still friendly restaurant with children.
3
The restaurant is in a wonderful location right on the beach, but I'm sorry to say the pizza looked anaemic, with the cheese barely melted and the ham under done. The pizzas on the table next to us looked much more appetizing!
5
We ate here our first night and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a casual place located on the beach. The chicken satay pizza was delish!
1
A nice location was spoiled by tasteless food, awful wine despite being the most expensive on the menu and very average service. Not to be repeated.
5
Great lunch, food was yummy, liked by all and the drinks were nice too. Very generous with the booze.... :-)
4
We got takeaway at lunchtime to take a break from the pool bar restaurant at the Shangri-La Sentosa. I liked the crust wood fire pizzas from there, nice and fresh
1
A nice location by the beach on Siloso island in sentosa was spoiled by tasteless food, and very poor service.The restaurant , being part of Shangri-la Hotel has the most expensive items on the menu but the taste and quality of the food is below average.We ordered pasta carbonara for kids which was poor. Greek sale was bad - we had to search for the pieces of Feta cheese. The pasta was too oily and the lasagne beef was not well cooked.What a waste of time , money and a Sunday family outing. Never Again - ever.I enjoy reviewing hotels and restaurants so that others may benefit from my experience as I do from others. Hope you found this useful
3
From snacks to main courses to desserts, the overall quality and taste of food was good. Service, however, was extremely slow. And, some dessert items we ordered did not show up, so when we didn't want to wait any longer, we asked for those items to be taken off the bill/check, paid and left
1
Service staff allowed a Caucasian at the back of the queue to cut the waiting line. When questioned, staff gave the excuse that the guest was not ordering anything. However, the guest was served food shortly after. It shows that the people who followed the rules don't get rewarded while those who break the rules get what they want
5
Fabulous Italian food on the beach with a cold beer - what's not to like , extensive menu with the highest quality produce
3
Food was good here & the location great. However the service was terrible we were rushed through our meal as they wanted to close! We arrived at 8.30pm which in my opinion is not late!
5
Chef Meng's pizzas and fresh salads are some of the best in Singapore, the location is a great chill and the staff pleasant.
I look forward to the next trip here.
3
pizza was decent sized and actually not that bad, if a bit salty. Kiddo loved being able to play on the beach while we were waiting for the food. I think most guests are from the Shangri-la which runs it.
4
we procastinated about dinner for ages, eventually we decided to go out... just a short stroll on the beach off the resort to the restaurant.
3
This is an example of why EIU says Singapore is expensive. The parma ham pizza came with one slice of parma ham.
Restaurant was quiet on Sat evening and by 15mins before closing they make it quite clear they want you to go.
2
3 years ago this place was great. Not now! Pizzas are very average - thin, little topping and cold. The only thing going for this place is that it's located on the beach at Sentosa and the kids enjoyed running around the sand. Food was very disappointing
3
all our food was average. pizzas needed more sauce and less cheese - too dry. pasta was tiny - lucky I was not very hungry. prices were not cheap either for what you got. wouldn't eat there again - rather eat at the hotel or get the shuttle over to where resorts world is and eat at one of the restaurants there
3
Pros- On the beach, great location! -Amazing viewsâ€¦you can really chill here.Plus the staff tried to accommodate our dietary restrictions with mixed results (which is rare in Singapore). Cons- Our kids got the pasta and it was a TINY portionâ€¦they were still hungry despite the $14++ price tag.-Where are the toppings! We got a pizza without cheese (due to allergies) and it came with almost no toppingsâ€¦so we paid over $20 for a piece of pizza base with nothing on it (not even tomato sauce)â€¦.gross ripoff.
4
The pizza was excellent and service was good. I loved this meal better than any other in Singapore because my daughter could slide and play in the sand just feet from our table. My husband and I could see her every second and have a conversation for once! :-
3
They have an outdoor setting and food was generally slightly above average. Service was so so.
No complains...
4
Delicious selection of pizzas and salads. Pizzas were made in front of us and baked in the outdoor pizza oven. Plenty of choice, plus smoothie, ice creams etc.
1
tiny serving of peer thin pizza.
tasted like pizza and charged a small fortune
avoid this tourist trap and eat somewhere else
2 kids pizza and drinks costed $60
highway robbery
4
We come here a lot when we come to Shangri-la hotel beside. the pizza is good quality and very tasty. same with all of the other food. never had any problems and is very pleasing.
But outrageous prices!! two margarita pizzas for 50USD!!
4
Fantastic pizza, nice crispy thin base, good choice of toppings, very reasonably priced & good service. Ate here while staying at Rasa Resort, very quiet for a Monday night. Would recommend as Iiving in Singapore I know how difficult it is to find good pizza.
5
This is the place for a good pizza, good pasta, good salad and some rosÃ© wine at the beach!
If you want, you can also enjoy a game of pÃ©tanque while the kids play on the beach...
5
We bought 10 takeAway pizzas for a large group and are them in the beach. Pizzas were fantastic - made on the spot, thin but just the right texture base, not too much topping or cheese - very highly rated. Service also great - staff have us extra chili and even a bottle of Tabasco to add if we needed it. Also had a cold beer while we waited for them to be made and only just had time to drink it !!
5
We were two families, one with two teenagers and one with two young children. Most ordered pizza but I had the seafood tagliatelle which was really nice! All said the pizzas were great, not greasy and the base lovely.A reasonable choice of pizza and pasta dishes. Prices on a par with much of the places on the island or Clarke Quay $18-$23, kids menu $13 which included an ice cream.Nice views across the beach and a small kids play area which we could see from where we sat, however, if you have small children, ask for a table nearer the beach so you can reach the children quickly if need be!Would definitely go back her
4
The restaurant is located on Siloso beach, and serves mainly pizza and p[asta dishes at reasonable prices. It only has outdoor seating so can get quite warm if not sitting below one of the many fans. It can also get quite busy at weekends when the locals descend to the beach, but worth a visit for the relaxing atmosphere and excellent service. To get there just take the free beach tram from the monorail station, and afterwards stroll back along the beach
4
Trapizza is a great little italian restaurant on Siloso beach next to the Shangrila. They have authentic wood fried pizzas and pasta, the 4 cheese pasta is a must try! It is a great place for kids as they can play on the beach while the adults enjoy their food in peace, there is also a small playground for toddlers, a pizza making area for kids and some arcade games to keep them all occupied while waiting for the food. All this for a reasonable cost, it is recommended to make a reservation as they only have limited slots available
4
As expected - pizzas and other italian food. All fine - tasty and with good service. Not high dining - then it is a beach side pizza joint. Fine for kids and informal eating
5
Lots of tables. Used by couples as well as family groups. Good view of people using the long and high zip wire above
5
One of our favourite restaurants in Sentosa, the Pizza is always freshly made in the wood-fire oven. The staff never fail to bring everything on time.
5
Loved the fact the staff were knowledgeable about food allergy and were able to offer alternatives. Disliked nothing.
3
This is in a nice location on Beach, close enough to walk from Shangri-la hotel.Pizza was very average and would probably try another pizza place next time.
3
Was staying at the Shangri-La Santos Island and needed to get away from the resort for some cheap eats and only 2 mins we we found this gem on Sislo Beach. Pizza is fabulous.
5
Great Service, Great place if you are a veggie or a non-veggie, Staff is great. The view from the hotel is amazing - sit by the beach and enjoy the pizza experience.
3
The food was nice but standard pizza fare. Hard to find given Shangri-La advertises it as being part of the resort.
4
Food at Trapizza was excellent, as is its location on the beach! We enjoyed the quattro formaggi pizza which was baked in a wood-fired oven and came in a large portion enough for 2 to share. Tomato and mushroom bruschetta and fries were also a hit. It's a amily friendly restaurant - kids will be entertained playing in the sand and watching people zipping by on the mega zip (flying fox) overhead.If you're going for dinner, be sure to get there early in the evenings as the last order is at 9pm and lights usually go off by 10pm
4
We stayed at the Shangri-la Rasa Sentosa in April and ate at Trapizza for dinner three times. The kids loved the thin crust pizza and the pasta dishes were very nice too. There is a kids menu that includes a drink plus icecream, however we just ordered a large pizza plus pasta for our three kids to share. It is reasonably priced and the best part is that it is right on the beach. The kids had a little play before and after dinner - bring some hand wipes! We enjoyed our meals there. The service is quite good and friendly too
4
Some of the best pizza ever had - crispy thin base. Lovely location on beach. Rescue remedy for tired kids not wanting to try anything adventurous in the way of Chinese or Indian food.
5
Did not know that it belongs to Shangri La - but has great pizza and relaxing atmosphere right on the beach. The kids can play on the playground while you are enjoying your meal.
3
Went here for dinner one night, 1 child had pineapple pizza which was okay, rest of us shared chicken nuggets, chips and spring rolls.
This is convenient to eat at if staying at one of the nearby resorts but probably cheaper restaurants at Vivocity.
4
The choice of Pizza and Pasta is good and the value is most acceptable.
Located right on the beach this casual dining experience was the best we had at Sentosa.
The staff are efficient courteous and the food is actually most palatable.
5
food was good. we had the seafood one and was yummy. crust on pizza nice and crispy. staff good, accommodated us a table near the sand
1
What is this? Like a fast food chain - uncooked food, bad service - it cannot be worse than this - a very bad reputation for shangrila hotel
Cp
5
read reviews online and went there and was not at all disappointed... its on the siloso beach and is almost outdoor, loved the ambiance.. we ordered pizzas and something else (forgot the name) that they suggested and everything was delicious... excellent food and wonderful service..
3
Was there with my boys during our stay at rasa sentosa. Place was very noisy and service was alright. Food we had were pizza and pasta which was really mediocre for the price. I think pasta mania has better tasting pasta n pizza ! Won't want to come back lest they improve on the quality of food
4
Located very close to the Shangri La Rasa Sentosa, this family friendly pizza/italian place was very, very good. Our party of four adults decided to eat 'family style' and were pleased to find that all of the dishes we ordered were tasty. The pizzas are very thin with good topping coverage. The lasagna had plenty of cheese and the pastas well made. A very relaxed beach side restaurant with a great selection of wines and beers to choose from
4
Trapizza is a very not formal place directly on the sea side in Sentosa,Siloso beach.Pizza is good and desserts as well. Wonderful place for families with children they can play on the sand or play modelling a piece of dough given by the chef!We will come back soon
3
Great for kids. Staff very accommodating. They appear to close early if there is not much patronage. Easy walk from Shangri La Rasa Sentosa property.
4
on the beach. nice simple pizzas and other italian fare. kids play stuff in the sand on the edge of the restaurant so good if you want a quiet drink before or after dinner!
5
The restaurant is well placed, you are nearly on the send and have a view on the beach.
The pizzas and burgers are very good.
I recommend this restaurant.
3
Nice pizza and pasta on the beach - has a little play area with cubby houses for the kids to keep occupied so teh adults can eat and have a drink for a bit longer
5
Do you need more than the title? Great pizza, fantastic lasagne and cold beer. Sea views and a short walk back to the hotel that it's attached to.
5
Great pizza and lasagne. kids playground right on the beach is fantastic. very relaxing for parents. the only problem was they dont cook lunch until noon which wasnt suiting us.
4
Portion sizes were good. Great taste, good service.There was a good choice of food for kids as well.
5
Family went there a few days ago and are going there again tonight for dinner. Amazing pizza, menu looks good, we had the Siciliana and the aloha - both excellent. The menu looks good and includes wine from Australia. The pizza here is as good as you will find across Italy - enjoy...!!
1
I went to Trapizza in Sentosa on the 18th of December with a friend and dog as we recalled that the restaurant was the only dog-friendly place apart from Delifrance which has closed down. We ordered:1) A prosiutto ham cold dish2) A BBQ pork ribs side dish3) Beer and two coffees.My complains:1) Service was slow as they were understaffed2) Both dishes tasted porky. 3) Cold dish was obviously straight from the fridge as the plate was cold.4) BBQ ribs was alright but I could tell it's not fresh as the meat was stiff and hard.We were both feeling sick with stomach flu and we both figured it is from Trapizza. We have been sick for almost 3 days and this has ruined our Christmas plans.I suggest your management look into the preparation of food to avoid more mishaps. Bad preparation of food can kill
3
We were expecting an excellent restaurant considering this is connected to the Shangri-la, but were somewhat disappointed. While the kiddie meal my pasta dish were very good, the pizza we ordered came undercooked. The vegetables on top were hardly cooked, meaning they had been placed on the cooked dough/cheese a bit too late. Plus the pizza base was not piping hot, only lukewarm. For the 3 dishes plus 2 drinks (only 1 beer) our bill was almost $100.00. This was strange, because when we ate at Casserole Restaurant INSIDE the hotel (where the food was exquisite), our bill was lower! How was that possible
4
The only pizza place in the world with a trapeze apparatus next to it. The pizzas are great and the trapeze experience is even better.
4
Very close to hotel and right on sand so a must really. Nice pizza and pasta and quite a good price. A good alternative to the nearby hotel restaurant.
2
I loved the food, it was nice, BUT, i vometed that night because of the food. Not sure if it was just me. be careful.
4
Dinner on the beach, pizza & pasta was good and the kids got to play in their play area while we waited (service was fast too!)
5
We dined here during our short stay at Rasa Sentosa.The wood fired pizza was superb, light thin base with a simple topping and blasting out with flavour.My wife and daughter loved the spaghetti too.What really surprised me was how reasonable the price of wine was, a big generous glass of Wolfblass Merlot only cost S$8!!.We found the service fast and very friendly without being intrusive.The restaurant is a pleasant short walk from Rasa along the lovely Siloso beach front.We will most certainly return here again on our next visit to Singapore
4
This outdoor / undercover pizzeria is a good spot to grab a bite to eat at any time of the day. We have now eaten here a couple of times, both have been good. The selection if pizzas is okay but could possibly be a little more varied. The drinks are also nice (especially the mocktails / cocktails!). Our favourite dish however was the spaghetti.Overall it offers a good service, good food and good music in a lovely beach setting just a short walk from a beach tram stop and the Shangri-la Rasa Sentosa hotel (meals can also be charged to your room if staying at this hotel); all at a fair price
3
Visited her to make a change from our usual Sentosa Friday night haunts. Booked a table for 14 which was no problem and was awaiting our arrival. Right on a large beach outside the Shangri-La Hotel so kids could play happily and safely. Site also boasts Basketball Court, Table Tennis and Football which are free and some other attractions you have to pay for. As we had a large order they made us write it down on one sheet to ensure nothing was missed - fair enough. Food arrived in dribs and drabs (not unusual in Singapore) but all present and correct and pretty tasty fayre too ! Think most had a pizza, salad etc. The only issue we had was that the service to get drinks etc was so haphazard so be embarrassing. Waving arms etc did not make much difference. No one seemed to be in charge of the waiting staff or were dedicated in individual areas so that was a bit of a let down
4
we were there last December and now we are back again at Trapizza. this place does not disappoint. the pizza and pasta are yummy delicious. one staff, Kuma was our waiter last year and he continues to remain professional, polite and helpful. He does really makes a positive difference the place! It was great to see him again. We will be back at Trapizza
4
At first sight, we loved the overall look of the restaurant by the beach. We got a nice place to sit with a view to the waters, there was this kids play area which was so nice to see kids, being a newly wed couple we are now.We ordered a pizza (pizza verdue) and a pasta, both tasted so well except that they went cold very soon due to the breeze and open-ness. Service is extremely fast, you may request them to slow down a bit, so you could spend time apart from dinner :PMust visit for young people, romantic it was. We went for our fifth monthversary :).Pinn
5
We ordered a pizza, the lasagna, and spaghetti bolognaise for our daughter. The food was fantastic, even what was served as part of the kid's meal! The location is also right on the beach so you can see the water, and there is a kid's play area as well
3
Idyllic alfresco dining by the beach -- rare in Singapore. However, food's not exactly fantastic, and service is so-so.
3
Very pricey, very thin pizzas. Main serving of spaghetti was the size of an entree. No one came with water even after asking for it twice! Poor service was surprising. Only positive was that it had a cubbyhouse for the kids to play in.
5
Love the alfresco dining. The kids eat close to nature. Not to mention, the pizza's good!
1
Had probably the worst pizza you can have at this place - no atmosphere, loud... :(
3
We had lunch at Trapizza. The Pizza is excellent; the rest pretty much mediocre. The Mocktails are just a mixture of 3 juices (found on the breakfast buffet).
4
Food isn't anything special, but the beach location makes up for it. Kids can play on a nice little play area between the restaurant and the sea. Our girls, aged 4 and 5, were happy as anything here while we got to have a drink and rela
3
The restaurant is actually operated by Shangri-la hotel. The food was fine, nothing exceptional. Location was quite ideal, outdoor setting with a play area for children, while waiting for your food to be served. We had only 1 disappointment, the kids meal could have offered a much better valued dessert instead of the mini Cornetto ice-cream. You could get a box of these ice- cream at the supermart for about $5-6. A scoop of Ben & Jerry's or the equivalent would have been better, and befitting of the Shangri-la standard.Overall, food was fine just think twice about the kids meal, might be better off ordering from the main menu for the kids
4
I had a pizza there which a very thin crust. Normally I don't like thin crust pizza but being hungry I pushed on. I found myself really enjoying the pizza despite my preference for thick crust so Ihave to say it was pretty good but also very expensive for pizza
4
Given it's a pizza restaurant by the sea on an island where you're basically a captive audience, you might be forgiven for expecting the quality to be low, but Trapizza serves great pizza; a good thin crust, and very rich sauce. There's an ok selection of drinks (four different beers, a few cocktails that are rather beach-focussed) and the desserts aren't bad (I'd recommend the creme brulee over the tiramisu, but that may just be personal preference).Staff aren't so brilliant though; it took several requests before we got any water for the table, and they sometimes seemed more intent on snatching the menu away from us, as if it were inlaid with gold leaf. For somebody like me, intent on ruminating over the choices available and then ordering more food, this seemed a little bit overzealous
3
I know, when you're eating a pizza with a view of the waves crashing over the shores of a beach only 100m away from you, expect to pay a little more. However, I felt that whilst the food was good, the price was quite premium. S$120 dinner for two is quite a large sum - especially in Singapore. I suggest grabbing some Pizza Hut and eating it on the beach if you don't want to pay through the nose
