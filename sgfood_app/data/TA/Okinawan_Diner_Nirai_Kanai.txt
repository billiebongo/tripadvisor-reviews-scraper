Went to this moderate place at Liang Court in River Valley Raod and enjoyed it. Food is not complicated but well cooked with decent prices. Washed down with beer and sake; very nice evening....

I love the food n drinks here. Hidden Cosy izakaya (Okinawa food) in liang court. The noodles, pork belly, minced-cutlet are my fav. However I find the seats too "hard" and not comfy enough

 I'm a regular here, and I've also been to Okinawa twice - the food here is not only faithful to Okinawan cuisine, but also of high standards that beat the average Okinawan diners in their own country.Service is excellent, ambience is very beach-like (a bit of a cliche, but all lovely). Dishes you must try if you've never been to Okinawa is the sea caviar and the peanut tofu - both very exotic and delicious. Everything else is good!<Tip> If you like grilled salmon, you should order the salmon head and belly - it has twice the amount of meat as a regular order of salmon. Subject to availability and also takes about 20 minutes to prepare

I love hanging out at Liang Court. I used to work in Singapore for 7 years. When I have a bad day, I usually go to Liang court to eat at Nirai-kanai or Ikeikemaru. Nirai Kanai features great okinawa cuisine. The food is very healthy and bursting with good flavor. I suggest going here at night time to soak the ambiance of the interior, and enjoy the food with a cold mug of Orion or Highball. It's very good, but it'll cost you around 25-30sgd for a good meal with beer in here

One of the more unique restaurants in Singapore, Nirai-Kanai serves food from Okinawa prefecture in Japan. Food served here is really unique and different from the typical Japanese restaurants. Must-tries include the bitter gourd chips (which are so addictive and do not taste bitter), the caviar-seaweed, garlic fried rice, seasoned chicken liver and deep-friend chicken. This is also the only place I've come across pink grapefruit beer, which is truly refreshing! Fast becoming our standard Sunday lunch venue

From the decoration to service and food, it is all done in the Japanese manner. You kind of have to be a pork, tofu and veggie lover to be able to enjoy your meal here. I ordered quite a few things but really love the nato (fermented beans)salad, grilled dried stingray and the rice balls.It is definitely an interesting place to bring your date to and it is reasonably priced.Will probably visit again.*got seated immediately for a weekday lunc

Wonderful ambience. Great place for a good meal with a companion. I was told to try the braised pork belly. It was good but too fatty for my liking. The other dishes of grilled mackerel, grilled chicken thigh and stir fried noodles were great. They also have 4 types of sake and a whole array of Japanese sochu to choose from. The Sake paired really well with our food. It was my first Okinawan food experience. I must say Okinawan food somewhat tastes like Chinese food but has a perfect Japanese delicate touch. I will be back for more. Will order the famous bitter gourd next time!

The first impression I had with the restaurant was the rustic wooden furniture and the Japanese posters and scrolls and even clothes hangers on the walls, giving the place a very Japanese feel.My companion who has visited Okinawa before recommended a couple of dishes including the green caviar-seaweed with ponzu sauce and stir-fried bitter gourd with pork, Okinawan bean curd and Okinawan egg.But luck was out for us as the green caviar-seaweed was unavailable.The bitter gourd, however, more than made up for it, as it was delightful and irresistible. The bitter gourd they have is different from the type we usually find in Singapore.The pig's ear with ponzu sauce and the octopus with wasabi were presentable appetizers, but in rather small portion. The kick of the wasabi and the citrus in the ponzu sauce gives a sourness that prepare the stomach well for the main course.My companion ordered the pock belly set meal while I ordered the salmon set meal. The salmon is rather ordinary, but the Okinawan flavoured rice (called seasoned rice in their menu) which I had curiously upgraded from my plain rice, was so delicious that I ordered a second bowl.We rounded up the dinner with a simple dessert -- the Okinawan round donuts. Crispy on the outside, soft and moist inside.A little downside on the service though. I ordered the flavoured rice, but the plain rice arrived, and when they were told, they took away the plain rice but didn't return with the flavoured rice, until we had to call them to remind them.The round donots also took a bit of time to arrive.On the whole, it was a good dinner. The meal of two cost about $85

The deco of the restaurant is the same as the one I visited in Japan, same ambience. The taste of the food is also the same. Service was attentive. Except for the bell to get their attention, it didn't seem to work. Other than that, all are good.

Yesterday is another visit of us in 2 months time. The food is alright but the service? Pffff...is very slow. The staffs will just ignore your present "throughout our present starting from the entrance to ringing the bell". I suppose we should give this place the last resort for Japanese food from today onwards
