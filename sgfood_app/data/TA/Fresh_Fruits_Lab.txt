Food was average. For instaworthy photos, be sure to order their drinks. Service was good, friendly staff :)

Servers were friendly and helpful. Food was average, a little overpriced in my opinion. Their menu for drinks are interesting and tastes better than the food.

The closest place only 2mins walk from my bf place. We always visit here while I'm in town. Our fav is Steak Burger. And must try their Rainbow Cake, best one!
My only suggestion is FFL need to make innovation their menu.

Went for our New Year Day's Brunch. Their dishes are delicious and prices are ok. Service is good. I will definitely go again

We came here for the very reasonably priced High Tea ($38 for 2).
The attached photos attest to the interesting and beautiful presentation. I recommend you try this unique, lite-bite, experience.

At this area, nothing much attracts me but FFL. Though overpriced and standard average taste, I must compliment the effort they put in for the presentation! The only thing lacking is the absence of customer service. As I could see most of the server are probably part time thus the sincerity in service is really lacking. Maybe it was just that day of visit, but I felt that the cafe wasn't busy, I would say manageable, not sure on the experience of the waiters, thus could not say that I had a wonderful experience.

Headed down to FFL for a Sunday brunch with my fam bam and the food was pretty good! The top dishes were the messy breakfast (truffle scramble was to die for) and my eggs florentine (the eggs were cooked to perfection). I loved how I drank my water from cute beakers that reminded me of secondary school lab days! Sadly, the bananalicious pancakes weren't exactly that yummy so I would recommend going for their pastas or egg based dishes instead! The food here is very reasonably priced and they even gave us complimentary juice shots which were so refreshing! I would be back for their brunch items again and prolly try their softshell crab burger the next time I'm back! All in all, a nice cafe serving tasty food, efficient service and with reasonable prices. *Do note that the cafe is rather small, and it can be a little squeeze when it's packed!

I have heard about Fresh Fruits Lab pretty long ago and I finally got a chance to try it! I love their food! There's quality and quantity, the presentation of the dishes are nice too. I love cafes with interesting deck and displays. Over here, you will definitely feel that you are being brought back to the days when you attend science lab classes A good place to have a catch up with friends over meals and I'm definitely coming back to try their mains (cause it looks just soo good!). They have interesting coffee combination. It is just that the hot drinks are a little sweet for me, and that's just my taste bud. I believe you can request for less sweet. Overall satisfaction level for me is high

Have heard much of this place but just had to try it. Complimentary juice in test tubes and water in beakers were much appreciated. Friend enjoyed your Pan Oriental very much and my The Club burger was not bad! Rainbow soda was really interesting as well :) Worth a visit with your friends/partner, you'll definitely enjoy your dinner!

Generally the quality of food here is above average and will definitely come back again.I have tried their Chicken Wings, Breakfast selections and Pasta, all pretty amazing.Price wise not too expensive and not cheap either.If you don't know where to eat, this place definitely won't let you down

Small place, nice friendly ambience, good service. Eggs Benedict and pancakes were very good. Fresh fruit juice blends really good. Whole family enjoyed it, we'll go back again.

Loved the food & good service. Unique deco on table top. Cushions kept dropping off chairs.
My pancake was a tad bitter due to burnt portions on 2 of the pancakes.
5
The concept of fresh fruit lab is different from others because they put the juices into test tubes and they give u for free for every table. Food is reasonably priced and quite yummy. Good for family or friends gathering

Food was great. Nice ambience and atmosphere. Nice place to have a weekend brunch.
They missed out on one of our orders but was kind enough to offer us a complementary cake.
Overall a pleasant experience.

A nice cafe tucked at a corner of the shop house along Changi Road. The staff welcomes you with sample of cold pressed fruit juice. The set lunch is only at $12.90+ which include Thai salad n a choice of main choice. Had the soft shell crab pasta which is cooked with chili crab paste from the menu.

Let me just get straight into it. Get "Da bomb burger" because it actually was the bomb! It was a bit messy to eat because the patty was so fat! (Not complaining) it was cooked to perfection, not dry! Also we got the steak it was a bit too salty for our liking but delicious non the less. Loved the fruit salad..it was light and not too over powering with the main. Perfect side salad. The restaurant is super cute and colourful with a chilled out vibe. The staff were quite friendly.. It's a cool and different concept so I would recommend to those who want to find a quirky little cafe/restaurant. You get free test tube juice shots whilst waiting for your food which was quite refreshing. The price was affordable but more towards the expensive side..

Came here after dinner to have cake and tea. Great ambiance and it was not crowded. The red velvet cake came out as the better choice than rainbow cake.we also tried the green paradise tea. Love the fact that we can request for hot water for refill the tea leaves for second round. Will come back again. The issue is car park. There is limited public car park space. But you won't miss the place as it is at the corner of the Main Street. It is on the right of the one way Main Street. There is a Muslim resturant near it.

This is a pleasant modern cafe with an interesting science theme. We were greeted by friendly staff and given some free taster test tubes of juice. Which were delicious. We ordered hot coffee and iced coffee which was good quality . There is a good selection of interesting teas. Which includes no caffeine roobios. You also get free hot water refills. We ordered messy breakfast which was a good portion size and very well cooked. Service was quick for drinks and food. I also couldn't resist trying the rainbow cake which tasted as good as it looked

This funky cafe serves drinks in beakers We ordered the afternoon tea The food came on a bunsun burner and the juices were in a test tube The desserts were laid out on a rectangle plate Tea was served in a lab beaker We also ordered burgers and nachos The atmosphere is lovely ,staff are friendly and accommodating A lovely afternoon out

I read about this place on a blog and decided to try their hi-tea. It was quite far from our hotel (25 mins from Orchard road) but totally worth it. The drinks in the beaker and test tube were quite cool and different. The platter looked great, savoury items were nice and the dessert were scrumptious. Their rainbow cake is the best, better than the one I've tried in humming bird bakery and in Pakistan. The service was good and the environment great. Although I expected the cafe to have a science lab kind of interior it was more like a regular cafe but nonetheless the food and drinks were great.They serve fresh fruit juices, detox water and healthy savoury options. A must try if you're in Singapore

Just love it, it's just super tasty, and very friendly. The science lab concept is very appealing:) will return!

The messy breakfast is a must try. And happy hour one-for-one is an additional point. The staff is very friendly and helpful. My friends and I love that place

A fruit themed cafe with a nice ambience. Welcoming gesture to provide complimentary test tube fruit juice for patrons.Ordered cappuccino and calamansi tart. Cappuccino was beyond expectations. It had body and robust flavour with hint of mocha. I guessed it was the cafe's custom beans. Calamansi tart was average. Personally, I preferred a more tangy taste.Fresh fruit lab offers hi-tea set for 2 from 3-5pm on Tuesday to Fridays. Would have gone for the hi-tea set if I had not had my lunch just before coming to the cafe.They do have many varieties offered. The con is limited parking spaces as with many eateries along Changi Rd.Worth a visit if u r in the area

Nice place to chill in the East area with a unique concept, where the apparatus used reminds us of our schooling days back in the lab. It serves nice western food and desserts as well, with free taster drinks served in test tubes as appetizers before the main meal. The steak is the best served at this price range. Great place for gatherings and quite popular spot for people who knew about this restaurant that's well hidden near Kembangan mrt station

I had an early dinner here and ordered a German Riesling. Although the wine was not too expensive, the selection was limited to Shiraz or Riesling. I chose the latter to go with my Prawn Aglio Olio. Let's just say I've tasted better pasta. A little fried garlic and olive oil would make it more palatable. The Chicken breast will be good for kids and those who may like boneless / meaty chicken. A little pricey I felt but the ambience, music as well as the artefacts made this a wonderful place to visit for experiencing a complementary fruit juice served in a test tube and water in beakers. Thanks to Xin Yi for serving us! :

love the place. Laboratory concept. They serve you samples of juices in test tubes for you to try. They were refreshing. Had the mushroom soup and my friend had the burger. Today he had a club burger. Loved it again. Will be heading there often. Friendly staff

Tried FFL for a family lunch & wasn't disappointed. Really funky place, with a science lab meets retro eclectic theme. Whilst the name suggests a focus on fruit, the menu encompasses far more. The Blackstone & Messy Breakfast were excellent and very reasonably priced. Highly recommende

I live in Kembangan area and it is about the time I tried this unique place. So me and Wife headed for this restaurant on weekday evening evening. Following is my review based on all angle of experience:AmbienceUnique as most traveler commented that the restaurant had infused labaratory concept. I applaud the effort and the complimentary welcome drinks which comes in test tube form. Service Generally very attentive and smiley all around Food The biggest disappointment comes in this area. I was actually quite surprised by few seasonal Travellers who had rated the food is pretty good. On that particular evening the Da Bomb burger patty was very dry and lacks the succulent feel in gourmet burgers. The rainbow cake is just massive but lacking in any real kick in our palette. Hence, the title of my review. The brunch food menu review in trip advisor have quite a positive review, so we are planning to head to this place for brunch then I can be really sure if it was one of mood from Chef

Went there for brunch on a weekday and they provided a set lunch menu. The Cafe provided complementary "drinks" in a test tube which was relevant to their concept. The entire design of the cafe is laboratory inspired, even the drinking glasses to the utensils tray provided. Food was served quickly and the ambience of the cafe was quiet and peaceful, which made it a nice location for brunch.

First time visited. It was down pour outside. Indoor seating was full. Fortunately after 3 mins we got seats. Service was great that notice us was soak in the rain and offer us a seat where not that cool.Ordered 2 sets of hi-tea. It was served within 5-8 mins. The look and presentation was fun and interesting. However it doesn't have the traditional scones or sandwiches. Portion size were way too small. Expect bigger portion and more variety. Set for 2 cost almost $38
