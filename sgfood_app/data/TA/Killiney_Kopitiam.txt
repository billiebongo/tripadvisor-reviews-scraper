A traditional Singapore café. All the locals use it..
Great place to try the traditional Kaya eggs and toast for breakfast
Nothing fancy, but a great way to get a local feel to Singapore.
5
Seemed to be filled with locals so we gave it a shot. The Mee Siam and Kaya toast earned thumbs up for our group of 4. Fairly priced, small place. BYON (napkins).
4
Strongly recommended for people who really wants to breath genuine local breakfast. Be ready for waiting, but it is worth it.
5
We discovered this place by accident. As we only in Singapore for a day and just look for some place to have breakfast and walk past this place and saw it was quite busy so we thought we going give it a try. Turn out to be quite popular among the local for breakfast. Their kaya’s toast dipped in half boil egg with soya sauce is the best, even my boy who do not eat anything but Australian food now think they are his new favorites. For dinner I wouldn’t recommend them as their menu is small and mostly breakfast food, but their chicken’s curry is very tasty to have with brea
4
It’s a one stop shop for local delights of the day gone by. Toasted bread with kaya with butter, local coffee with condensed milk, and half boiled eggs. Nasi lemak wrapped in banana leaf and other noodles ... curry, fish ball and etc. not bad ..
4
Crowded with locals, this coffee house serves more than kopi (coffee), served so that you can sip it from the saucer: The classic porridges, laksa noodles and Kaya toast of Singapore past. With very reasonable pricing, it can become a daily habit--and you can take your edible history home. The company now packages their sauces, spices and mixes for sale, displayed just next to the cash register

I'm told thats always a good sign in Singapore if something is good. We stayed across the road on the first morning early we went for a walk up to Orchard road and purchased a Starbucks coffee as we don't have them in Western Australia. Big mistake it was expensive and just average. On our way back to the apartment we decided to pop in has french toast and Coffee O (coffee with milk powder just try it it's good $1.50 per cup) for less then the price of the Starbucks was delicious and cheap. It was our regular after this. If it is busy you will wait a little but not more than a few minutes. We loved the place. I think it's also the place to be seen having breakfast as we saw many expensive cars out the front
1
Went on a Sunday for dinner. It wasn't crowded, and one has to pay only in cash at the counter when ordering. There is no options for other modes of payment. Then the ordeal occurred. First, a very long wait for the food. Because you have already paid, there is no choice. The restaurant post a notice that they have lack of staff, so a long wait is to be expected. Besides the wait, when the food came, it was just terrible. I ordered poor chop with rice. It was really very bad. This place does not serve proper food. It is just purely concerned on making money, and not about the quality of food and service and satisfaction of their patrons
3
Just an ordinary Coffee Shop in Singapore, went there on Sunday morning and the que was normal. Eat Nasi Lemak with Otah, haven't eat anything else as the portion are big. Great place to waste some time on sunday morning.Will give another shot when i get there
5
I have lost in count for how many times I've been coming back to this place since the first time I know it. They still serve the best Mee Siam after all these years and always packed with people, be it locals and/or tourists.The service was always great. They were fast in serving the food & drink. Price wise, it is considered affordable for a filling meal. Kudos for preserving the taste for many years 
5
I come here for breakfast quite frequently. I especially like the kaya butter toast (you can add extra butter for only $0.30), otah bread (ask for "一对一") and Nasi Lemak. Must try!
5
Still the best place to get a feel of Singapore. Every visit in Singapore this is the place to go.
A must.
3
The food was cold and the place was freezing! That is how I would like to summarized the place.
There was toast and eggs, chicken rice, fried bee hoon and kuih tiaw and drinks. Nothing much there
4
Hot Coffee and Tea for $1.50 each! My first time here and I enjoy the ambience so far. I like that tables and chairs are not placed too close. There are many funny and lame jokes on the wall if you have a boring companion :P overall a good hiding place away from the main shopping street.
4
Try this one and you will learn to appreciate a piece of local coffee and breakfast culture. This is my go-to place for breakfast or afternoon break every time i visit Singapore. It is my personal favourite and is also a popular stopover for office workers and tourists. It is tucked on a side street in Orchard Road. I would highly recommend for tourists to stop by to try the toast with kaya and kopi or teh-si. A picture paints a thousand words. Eat local and have fun
2
I have been patronising this shop for many years . Service has deteriorated over the couple of years. One has to wait a long time for coffee to be served despite not having a long queue. The joint is fortunate that it has business from tourists as i believe the shop is on the list of must try food joint. Possibly because of the tourist trade the owner of shop can afford to neglect on good service. I will avoid patronising it if i can help it from now on
4
Opposite the Fragrance Hotel Riverside, this Hainanese coffee shop does a terrific breakfast. Try the noodles with prawns, and a boiled egg, very hot and spicy. I didn't like the western breakfast though. Another option is coconut rice with chicken, peanuts and anchovies and fried egg, with a curry past
4
@TheKuoKnowsIt doesn't matter whether you turn up at breakfast, lunch or dinner. Killiney Kopitiam on Killiney Road is good any time of the day.My favourite is still breakfast. But be prepared to wait. It can get pretty packed. So try to secure a table first because the restaurant is semi-self-service - you order and pay at the counter, and wait for your food to be brought to you.The 62 degrees half-boiled eggs are sublime. A runny yolk surrounded by quivering whites is my ideal way of starting the day. Add to that "freshly stewed" tea, two rounds of toast, and you have breakfast the Singapore way.Killiney Kopitiam makes a pretty mean bowl of Mee Siam too. That is comfort food at its best late into the evening
2
Perhaps the very last time to patronise such degraded Killiney Kopitiam new outlet at L1, Fortune Centre, Waterloo Street due to poor quality fast local Malay dishes ( 'mee siam' and 'mee rebus' ) plus a cup too many 'teh susu' and badly baked 'kaya roti' !Further, self-service counter customer reception is also unfriendly and messy. Basic stool and table seating fronting the stall at L1 void deck is shabbily provided and filled with uncollected trays, cups and plates...In sharp contrast, we still cherish our regular patronage at Toast Box at L1 Great World City which offers excellent fast snacks of F&B plus excellent counter service all these whiles 
5
My first visit was in 2011 and ever since, I have stopped by at least once every time I'm in town. Yes it gets pretty packed during morning rush hour and lunch time and the place has no aircon but service is to the point and food is consistently delicious. The kaya toast has excellent kaya to butter ratio and is even better when dipped into soft boiled eggs. The chee cheong fun has a good bite to it and I loved slathering it with sambal and the sweet sauce. My favourite is definitely the mee siam! It hits all the flavour spectrums (except for bitterness) and acts as an excellent wake up call to begin another day of exploring Singapore. In terms of drinks, the iced horlicks and teh tarik is delicious. The barley water is quite yummy but a bit sweet and does not come with actual pieces of barley.It is about 5-10 mins walk from Somerset MRT and I recommend to everyone to visit at least once in their lifetime
5
I like my coffee. After a meal a good espresso, a good flat white in the morning etc. The coffee here is excellent, yes it has a slightly different taste to Arabica beans, but boy is it good.
4
Love the coffee and toasts. Still the same after all these years. Getting busier over time, but can still get seats if wait for a while.
5
I came in the late afternoon. I was not so hungry, and took Mie Rebus [Noodle Soup] and coffee. The taste was very good and the price was reasonable.
4
My morning coffee spot for our short stay in Killiney Rd. Good coffee with the locals coming and going.
5
Came here daily for 4 days in Singapore, they have best coffee and milk tea, it is self-service, table is cleaned every turnover, the place seems very nice and clean, It was nice to talk to uncle Peter, the cashier lady was careful asking if we would bring the kaya jam abroad so she wrapped them nicely to prevent any damage, lovely place and amazing peopl
3
We knew food in Bintan resorts were expensive so we bought our lunch and dinner at the killiney in Tanah Merah ferry terminal. It's a bit expensive compared to when u buy in the city but still their nasi Lemak, curry puff, spring roll and mee rebus were ok
3
Sigh, after my review about Yakun, Killiney too, fails to keep up its standard on their beverages. We went there for brunch and ordered the usual, Kopi-O, Teh Gao, Nasi Lemak plus Otak, Mee Siam and Chee Cheong Fun. The Chee Cheong Fun is average while the Mee Siam is still as good. Nasi Lemak is Nasi Lemak, can't really go wrong. As for the drinks, it's diluted. After we highlighted to the server, they offered to redo the drinks. This time, it's ok.Overall, the variety of food and beverage makes it worth while.
4
We enjoyed several breakfasts here on our recent visit to Singapore. The coffee was fantastic - really rich and yummy. We went with the traditional breakfast of coffee, 2 soft-boiled eggs and kaya toast. What's not to love? It's a very casual, bustling spot where you see mainly local folks. We really liked being someplace that wasn't all tourists
5
Great clean cafe for authentic Malaysian breakfast. The chicken curry with roti part is a must have and should be washed down with coffee or tea which can be served cold or hot. Can also buy local produce there to take home. Recommend you save some room and have a curry puff on the way home at the sister shop a block away also ! Strongly recommended
3
It's brunch so we tried Mee Rebus and Laksa, chendol and otak instead of the usual kaya toast and soft boiled eggs.Well, we were disappointed at the "below par" local dishes. The chendol was the most disappointing as it shows a tall glass of it on the menu. A bowl arrived with light brown shaved ice and a splotch of coconut cream on the shaved ice, instead of coconut milk and gula melaka. This gula malaka (palm sugar syrup) was tasteless as was the coconut cream. It's the first time I found large tapioca pearls (boba) instead of attap chee. It would've been better not to have these items than "modern" substitutes.I'm sticking with the traditional eggs and toast...
3
This Killiney coffee shop serves nice traditional coffee. We also had Roti Prata with chicken curry, which is quite good because it's not too oily. The french toast is also not bad. Their soft boiled egg is very good...
4
Nice lunch! Looked like a collection of sheep balls in egg but tasted much better!!
Great food count too.
3
It was a nice coffee joint, but the coffee does not taste the same anymore. It has a mixed of instant coffee machine taste. I hope they will improve on the standard.
3
I never miss order the toast and half boiled eggs when visit here. The kopi-c is full of aroma smell when serve. Also don't forget the bread dip in curry chicken
2
Toast was dry, crumbly, not enough butter, or rather butter not spread properly. Coffee was passable. Definitely will not visit this outlet again
4
It's busy-ness reflects its enduring popularity! Had butter sugar toast and white coffee. Coffee was divine but the sugar was so little in the butter sugar toast that we added some more!
3
Simple soft boiled eggs, sandwich of cheese and jam, and iced coffee. Best option at airport at 4 am
5
Can't go past Kaya when in Singapore and I was told by a local that Killiney is the best one. With a great variety of breakfast and other food options you're hardest decision will be which options to order. We had the Kaya French toast, Mee Rebus, soft boiled eggs and Ginko curd. Was absolutely delicious, for something different I highly recommend the Ginko curd. Oh and don't forget to buy a jar of Kaya as you will be craving it when you return home.
3
interesting old coffee shop along killeney road. main outlet. must have plenty of outlet nowadays. not easy to find parking and the favourite nasi lemak with the salted fish always sells out fast. cannot understand why the owner doesn' t bring more in. the outlet in pj serves different dishes, same name but unsure whether same owner or has partnerships. saw one at klia 2 after immigration at one of the right end terminal wing before the main link bridge. main killeney road branch unchanged after so many years , workers and maybe owners also look similar like yesteryears
5
This is the original coffee shop singaporean/locals have gone to for over 30 years. Soft boiled eggsKaya on toast Local coffee/ tea (Kopi /teh in local language)Those 3 are the pillars of what has kept this restaurant going and over the years they have added variety to their menu such as curry chicken, Mee siam, and Nasi lemak. Highly recommended to tourist who wants a local experience or just a great place for locals to go to for a pick up breakfast joint
5
clean, efficient and cheap, great go-to place for quick and filling breakfast. staff are on-point but still manage to smile.
4
Went there for breakfast several times during a business trip. The food is tasty and good. It's pretty busy so you'll have to move quickly to get a table.
3
Great spot for breakfast not only for local also visitors .
Standard menu .
Tea and local coffee with boiled eggs and toast are popular
Curry noodle , otak otak and Nasi lemak are also available .
Very crowded quick in and out place
4
I buy Cuold Tea-C at Killiney Kopitiam Changi, while waiting for my boarding schedule. Very affordable, with only 2.4 SDG.
The location near Starbucks and Tip Top. The service was excellent, very fast served. Good spot to try in Changi Airport
4
One of the two free breakfasts if you stay at Lloyd's Inn. Look out for boiled eggs - they are barely boiled. Crowded withb locals for breakfast
4
Came here on weekend. As usual it's crowded with locals n tourists. They do not come in set of coffee, eggs and toast. It has to order in ala carte.
I love the French loaf toast though, that not easily available at other coffee stores.
2
Our hotel gave vouchers for breakfast at this coffee shop. We had very soft bolied eggs (could also be ordered hard boiled) and toast with butter and jam. Both the coffee and tea is by default very sweet with lots of milk and sugar.The place seemed very popular among locals
5
I have been here only twice, and it will be on my must revisit list when I come to Singapore now! The restaurant itself is very old dating back to early 1900s, and is well known to the local. You should arrive early or you will have to queue for very long time as the restaurant is rather small
3
The restaurant is located on Killiney Road which itself is a paradise for culinary fans with 12 restaurants and pubs from across the world all in a row. The Kaya Toast is a legendary breakfast toast that is embellished with a secret home made spread that is unique. You also get French Toast - but don't expect it to be fancy - it has been localised. The Kopi is fabulous and available in different avatars Incl the one with condensed milk. One has to place the order and pay at the counter and the food is then served to you at the table. Apart from these the place offers traditional heavyweight options like Laksa, Nasi Goreng, Nasi Limak and more. A great place to try out the local fare
1
High jacked on the road even saying that we would only buy a cup of coffe, seated with a table and wanting to order the coffe, we where told to look in menu before we ordered we knew that we just wanted coffe so tried to attract the waitress to get the order set, after 5 min we left, first and last time there
2
An undercooked watery egg was the start and finish to this restaurant. I opened the shell the white of the egg poured out. Disgusting.
4
Had a quick bite here, yummy and crispy toast and coffee. Will come back here again to try other dishes
4
Went to the original shop to have Kaya toast and coffee. The Kaya has an egg taste and was nice. Coffee was nice and ended up having an awesome conversation with one of the locals who comes their everyday for breakfast.
2
A Singaporean friend took us to this store to try their toast and coffee. The toast should be one of the " must try" in this store. It came out as a disappointment compare to toast served in Tokyo or even in Hong Kong. Not worth trying and can skip. Nothing special, just dry thin toast
5
Had our breakfast there, very delicious and such quick service.I had Mee Siam, a favourite Singapore noodle dish and a cup of tea and my husband had soft boiled eggs with a cup of coffee with toast, all for an approximate cost of under $10
4
Good place for local breakfast.Love the French loaf toast. It will be toasted to right degree of crispness. It can be crowded in the weekend morning. Be here early at 7plus to beat the crowd.Do take note, there is an unspoken rule where u r needed to queue for a table. It is not a situation where u can randomly sit when you spot an empty table. The queue starts at the entrance of the shop.A place frequented by locals and tourists.Plenty of carpark lots available. Alternatively you can walk from Somerset/Dhoby Ghaut mrt station. That will take about 10mins if you stroll
3
Our hotel gave us a voucher for a standard breakfast set here, and we enjoyed it moderately (& were glad to have experienced it), but three days in a row was a bit much (the third day we turned down the very, very under cooked soft boiled eggs - but they didn't give us any extra toast!)It is very popular with the locals, so it is interesting to see where they eat. But I wouldn't want the same breakfast again
4
I stopped by today for a quick lunch and had a delightful experience!Ordered the Stir fried Fish Hor Fun and it was beautifully cooked by Uncle Leong ( I was told) who has been at this location since it opened its doors!The plate of Hor Fun was just right, not salty and the gravy was not too gooey with starch...Fish in the dish was fresh too!!The coffee I had was delicious and made with great care and attention!How I wish so many other food outlets in Singapore would pay more attention to food and beverage...I can't believe how many kopi tiams in Singapore make awful coffee and tea !Just a little bit of attention and care brightens someone's day!Some say "Food nourishes the Spirit of the person eating it" so I hope many owners of food and beverage outlets would put more attention here!It gives a little comfort to a person having a challenging day and makes life happier and brighter for that moment....So Kudos to all the staff at Killiney Cheong Chin Nam Location!Kudos to Uncle Leong and to the person who made that delicious cup of coffee....THANKS! COFFEE WAS SO GOOD, I ORDERED A SECOND CUP!Wishing All at Killiney Kopi Tiam A Very Happy Fruitful New Year!Lil
5
Serving traditional food all day long. The shop is always busy from the moment it opens at 6am to closing time. Food is delicious & consistently prepared, the same for the drink, coffee & tea & other drinks taste the same every time. Can be hard to find a seat, may have to wait a while at breakfast, lunch & dinner time
1
Killiney Kopitiam at Changi.My meal came with a used spoon with obvious licking stains on it. When I alert the counter staff, she behaved like its normal, stern face, not apologetic at all but just handed me with another one. Sticky table and sticky floor. This place should close for health concerns and poor staffing
4
Loved the Teh C and the kaya toast here- it was fun to sit at this cafe and watch the world go by ! Frequented by the locals as well - a sure sign of value for money.
3
The coffee and food is not very cheap. It's becoming a tourist trap with many of them coming to try out their formerly good local coffee and toast bread.The roti prata with chicken curry is at least 3x what the next door indian restaurant sell. Yes, this one comes with a bowl of chicken curry and next door is just an optional piece of chicken
4
Killiney Kopitiam is a great place for a fast meal/snack. It is in every way a Kopitiam with stools and rough tables and nothing much. The atmosphere is noisy. Order and pre-pay your food. About the only service is when they serve the Food. This is not a criticism. The food is good and reasonably priced for Singapore. We liked the Chicken curry, Cheong Fan, French Toast with Kaya, Bread Roll with Kaya, Chendol and Kopi. If you are visiting the area, try it, it still has the character of yesteryears.My only fault with the place is it is not wheel chair friendly! There is a step down from the adjoining shops and from the 5 foot path.,,
5
I live around the corner from this place and EVERY day, anytime I pass this place is full of locals. That alone recommends it as a great place for a bit. Their kaya toast is delicious, served on crispy white bread with a generous slab of butter. Their kopi is also quite excellent, and they serve one of the best laksa's around.Order your food at the counter and tell them your table number - they will then bring the food to your table. Service has always been very quick for us, even on busy days. Definitely worth a visit!!
4
I have had local breakfast at many places but this restaurant by far is the best one yet. Rumors is that they are the one to invented the local breakfast now and they actually have a timeline when the restaurant started almost 100years ago. Overall, the quality of the food is great, reasonable price. Be ready to wait for a long time on the weekend if you come later than 9:00AM
4
had breakfast here most of my visit to Sing. NO wifi! you are here to enjoy your breakfast. The real Killiney kopitiam. Order the breakfast set (2 eggs, kaya toast and coffee). Though its always full, the server is friendly. Come after 9 (you will surely get seat)
4
This is a good place to enjoy a local Singaporean breakfast - toast, soft boiled eggs and a cup of good Hainanese coffee! It's always busy and crowded but the turnover is fast so just linger around for a while to get a table. It's now a franchise in various countries but this original shop is by far the best among the lot. The kaya toast is so good with the chunk of butter melting in your mouth. Pair it with the coffee and you have the perfect foodgasm
4
I was about to head to Soup restaurant that evening but some workers were trying to lift up the beautiful brand new sign board, Killiney caught my eyes.It was their opening week. Needless to say, I always love their coffee, hawker fare.Seems like the place maybe a franchise n NOT owned by Killiney.I am impressed by the attention the customers are getting. I ordered their beautiful kopi O. Also, on the board was chicken rendang nasi lemak.It was really really nice ... I must admit n being served to me @ my table that I am not used to as its always being self service.For that special touch. I will be back again soon.Keep it up ... Guess I will be back soon.
1
Went to the new outlet at Valley Point - they messed up our order and missed out 2 dishes that we ordered. The food came out dish by dish very slowly. The mee rebus, fish bee hoon and chicken chop were below average. They should stick to the kaya toast and tea that they are famous for. This venture into local dishes is a miserable failure.Will never come by again
4
This is a casual and no-frills breakfast cafe along the busy Killiney Rd. There are a few branches/franchises in Singapore but I was told this original shop is the best.I ordered the normal butter/kaya toast and the french toast. Hands down the french toast was out of this world! It was so good with the butter and the kaya spread which is an Asian coconut/pandan custard spread.All the other food items in the menu looked amazing as well.Great for local breakfast
5
we enjoyed the local breakfast of eggs, coffee and kaya toast (coconut jam). It's a good way to start a busy sightseeing day!
4
A short walk from Orchard Road. A small shop with lots of locals which is a good sign. Aside from the food, enjoy reading the funny signs on the wall as well as quotes.
4
Great local spot for breakfast.
If you enjoy people watching you definitely need to visit ! You can tell people meet there with all families or popping in for a quick bite with workmates.
Food was really good , interesting coffee, quick and nice service.
3
Clean, simple and cheap local Singapore food. Great place for 2-3 friends short catch up. It's would b nicer if that's table service as request.
5
The Mrs wanted to try the Hainanese chicken to compare it to Thailand and this place were really helpful and according to the Mrs the chicken and soup was delicious
1
I was having lunch around the corner when I decided to pop by Killiney Kopitiam for a quick coffee before heading back to work. I've walked past it several times and never had the chance the try the coffee until today. I wasn't expecting much to be honest, just a good cup of coffee, but things went south very quickly. Ordered a kaya toast and coffee with skimmed milk to dine-in and it took a good 10 minutes for the coffee to be served. Now, before you start telling me that 10 minutes isn't too long, please do consider that this is local coffee; most coffee shops if not all, already have a pot of coffee made prior and all they have to do is to pour the coffee and add the skimmed mlik and it's ready to be served. If the pot runs out, it'll only take maybe another 3 - 4 minutes to brew another one. The tables before me waited a while before getting their coffee. My bread came pretty fast though. Now to the food quality; the kaya bread toast was actually really good. The bread was soft and fluffy, the kaya was delicious and the butter was given in the right amounts. Since my coffee went to mars and back; taking a pit stop on the moon, my bread was getting cold, so I finished it first. Went over to the counter to ask for my coffee and was told tersely but nicely to wait for a while. After taking a long holiday in the Maldives, my coffee decided to show up. And it was BAD. It tasted pretty much like skimmed milk with a dash of coffee. I was a little grumpy by then and brought the cup back to be changed, and the coffee came back pretty quickly. This time round, boiling hot. Probably a revenge from the staff for complaining. Even though the colour of the coffee was darker, which indicated they put less skimmed milk, the coffee still tasted horrible. Actually, there was no taste whatsoever. After taking a small sip, I stood up and left immediately. Doesn't live up to it's legacy. Taste worse than the coffee you can get at any other coffee shop
3
My mom, grandma and I visited the branch at Valley Point Singapore. Firstly, when my mom ordered our food at the counter, they did not tell her that certain foods were unavailable. Only when we were collecting food that was ready, they told her that 'nasi lemak' was out of stock. My mom then ordered toast set instead. When she went to collect food again from the counter, they told her that the breakfast menu was unavailable as the kitchen staff was busy making only food from the lunch menu ( the menu states that the breakfast menu was available throughout the day. Second, when we were eating, we noticed that for my chicken curry, both the potatos and the chicken were not fully cooked. the potatos were still hard and the chicken was red inside. Would not recommend going here at all
5
You know how time flies and this is one thing we always wanted to do buy could not. NOW was the chance and we love every minute of it. Thanks goodness, the younger generation has kept this old traditional alive and improved it and expand it. But we kept to our original roots and went back to the same old place. Brings back young and happy memories when I once lived up the road
5
I visited the one in Killiney Rd many times since 1996. The coffee is mysteriously nice! In old days, I enjoyed very very nice laksa, nasi lemak or french toast breakfast or lunch here in traditional kopitiam style. Sadly, last time I went, this place have adapted a bit of Starbucks style ordering system (but they still deliver food to your table) and loosing its touch. Gladly, the old man still sometimes walking around say hello to customers.I tried one outlet in Jakarta (looks like under franchise system), and gave up, Killiney completely keep their good things only in Killiney Road
5
For a piece of definitive Singaporeana, Killiney Kopitiam is a must. In a land where F&B outlets come and go faster than one could finish a cuppa, this institution is still going strong after 96 years in business at the same location. Go therefore to the original outlet in Killiney and don't bother with the franchises outlets elsewhere. For whatever reason, the namesake kopi or coffee tastes best at this store. Some say is the temperature of the coffee, others say it is the freshness of its beans; I'd say it is both plus the fact that you could consume the 125ml liquid within a 10 degree F temperature band, its optimal performing range all about 7.5 min which is about the duration you could put up with the sweltering heat of the cafe, ventilated only by a few fans. So don't ask management to install air conditioning. Then the coffee won't taste as good even with if you hang around longer. Next, take a Lipitor if you must, but order the quintessential Singaporean breakfast of 2 soft boiled eggs with Kaya toasts. Don't return the eggs when you crack open the shell and discover that they are quite raw with mostly translucent whites. Pour some soya sauce over it, take a bite of the toast and you dig in. Oh yes, Kaya is really sweetened coconut curd with souffle quantity of egg yolks, steamed with pandan leaves for extra flavor. They are smothering rectangular chunks of butter on cardboard strength toasts. Somehow the whole dry concoction works with the barely cooked silky eggs, especially when you wash it down with generous sips of the steamy kopi. As for ordering the right combination of coffee with/ without milk and sugar, please Google it. As for me, I'll go for Kopi kosong for straight black or Kopi Siew Dai whichbis coffee with a bit of condensed milk " less sweet" than regular Kopi. There you have it. You are all set to go and enjoy Singapore coffee

Location : easy to find this shop for many places in Singapore
Food : varieties with delicious meal ( Local food )
Staffs : friendly
Long queue in the rush hour.
4
Located near famous Orchard Road, they serve coffe , tea ansd some hawker meals such as mee siam, laksa and curry puffs. I like their curry puffs and tea tarik.
4
Its original location is tucked at the back of Orchard Road, next to singtel building. Renowned for its locally brewed coffee and kaya (pandan-coconut confiture) toast .
Other locations seems to pale in comparison. Perhaps its not easy to maintain consistent quality.
4
This place serves Singapore classics like mee Siam and mee rebus. The toast and coffee and tea are typical Singaporean food as well. Try this place out for classic Singapore food!
5
A legendary, must try their curry puff and teh tarik. Also the kaya toast is very nice, with its side dish, half boiled egg.
5
Breakfast vouchers from Lloyd's Inn as part of our tariff: We each received two boiled eggs (hard or soft) toast (French or standard) and a coffee. Quick, friendly service. Other local dishes like nasi lemak available. Very popular eatery.
4
I am a dedicated coffee drinker and an avid egg consumer for breakfast or for that matter any time of the day, so on reading the reviews of Killiney Kopitiam I assumed this must be an epicurean heaven for me and I was absolutely right. I loved the strong fresh smelling Java they served as well as the soft boiled eggs with French-Toast liberally smeared with Kaya jam. This was the first time I had tasted Kaya jam and I instantly developed a love for it so much that I carried a few jars back with me on my return trip. We were staying close by so we loved dropping in for a bite at this busy joint. My wife tried the Chicken curry once and it was excellent. If you are a person who shares my taste in food please do visit here
5
This is a local's favourite and you need to be there early to beat the crowds. Sitting space is at a minimum so prepare to rub shoulders, bump elbows and even share a table if you intend on getting your comfort food. There are a few must-order items on the menu: boiled eggs, kaya toast and tea/coffee. The local's version of breakfast on any given day. It's near to the Somerset MRT station so you shouldn't have a problem with transport

My Chinese friend introduced me to half-boiled eggs and kaya bread at Killiney Kopitiam. Delicious experience, good food, bustling and busy, prompt friendly service... the coffee is excellent, rich in flavour, and it is served very hot. Visited three times while staying at a nearby hotel
4
This quaint old lady is a cornerstone along Killiney Road, in fact so much so that just the mere mention of Killiney would bring up the coffeeshop first before the street.The servings of hot thick local 'sock-sieved' coffee remains a constant favorite amongst locals. This combined with soft-boiled eggs and kaya-butter toast makes the perfect quick fulfilling snack.Don't miss out the Curry Chicken & French Loaf, Chee Cheong Fun, Mee Siam, etc.Love love lov
5
Ate here several times (both eat-in and take-away). The food was always tasty. Lots of choices for food, so no matter what kind of a meal you would like, odds are you can find something here.
4
Breakfast was very good, staff were busy but helpful and friendly. Was a bit dubious of very soft boiled egg, but french toast and toast were delicious. Really good coffee
4
The traditional design of the coffee shop, and the food that they served was great! However, the seats were rather limited. Their service was rather great as well.
4
Had this for breakfast, kaya toast accompanied by half-boiled egg, and tea tarik. Good value, and very energising!
4
Love the kopi, toast and half boiled eggs. Don't need much else to make me happy. This place is always busy, except when it's CNY. Please stay open.

Had tea with three other friends.You still get to sit a marble top table and stools reminence ofa bygone coffee shop.The menu has a fair range of dishes like chicken curry, mee siamand the standard coffee,tea, toasted bread, soft boiled eggs andsome desserts.Place your orders at the counter and your orders will served in short order.I like their toast which is nice and thick and not sliced through to make twoslices like some other kopitiams. The other litmus test of a good kopitiam is the coffee. I like my coffee robust& they serve a decent coffee.This place still draws in the crowds and turnover is frequent
4
This is a traditional kopi tiam ( coffee shop) serving an excellent breakfast around Orchard Road. Besides their signature dishes of half boiled eggs and butter / kaya toasts the menu includes local favourite dishes like laksa,mee siam, mee rubus and nasi lemak.Prices are reasonable and the food very "Singaporean". As there are limited seats in the shop house be prepared to wait for a table especially between 7.30 am to 9.00am. You have to order the food and drinks at the counter and make payment.At the same time inform the cashier your table number. The food will be delivered to your counter when ready
3
Came here (to the outlet in Marina Square) after lunch today for some tea and kaya toast. I like the outlet at Marina Square because it's never too busy and as a result there's no problem getting a table, or having to wait too long to be served. Tea and kaya toast is in line with expectation
4
My sister and I received free breakfast vouchers from Lloyds Inn for two complimentary kaya toasts and Kopi from Killiney Kopitiam. It isn't particularly attractive inside and the cleanliness is questionable, but it is crammed on one of Singapore's popular food streets and hence reflects the authenticity of their cuisine. The kaya toast comes in either white bread or french toast. I had the french toast, which was two eggy pieces of pan fried bread, whilst my sister had the white which came like a toasted sandwich. It doesn't look like much and is a rather small serving size, but it tastes great with a blob of kaya and a brick of butter. The soft boiled eggs come on the side and are super soupy inside, served with a dash of soya sauce if you fancy. The service is brisk, no nonsense and not really that friendly, but the food is cheap and comes out fast! A good place to stop by for a quick breakfast if you are in the area.Tip: you do need to go in early (I would say around the 7.30am mark) to secure a table because after that it gets super rowdy. It's extremely popular
5
A KOPI, or that's how Singaporeans like to call their coffee, is made from condensed milk. The taste is of a full bodied brewed coffee!! Amazing! Loved every bit of the coffee and toast combination.IF you're in Singapore, you have to try the Kopi + toast combination!
1
Dislike
Noisy, not inviting, not good at all. Sorry cannot rate better................................
4
I had breakfast here on two days during my stay in Singapore, it is a busy local cafe frequented by tourists and locals alike. They do a nice basic breakfast (hard boiled eggs, toas and coffee for me), The service is good
4
the mee rebus is awesome! the service is fast and efficient! but try to avoid lunchtime crowd cz you'll never find a table.
5
Getting a table maybe challenging during breakfast hours, go early as they open from 7am. Visitors must not miss their kaya bread toast and half boiled egg for a local breakfast experience. Their kaya is simply the best, and eggs with huge yolks are half boiled to perfection! Their tongsui are also superb, each bowl is loaded with ingredients and not too sweet.
4
I was in the area and wanted to try the kaya toast and kopi. The kaya toast is okay, the kaya is a little too eggy with not enough pandan for my liking. But the toast is thin, crisp and buttered generously. Likewise the kopi is quite bitter. Luckily I had to get something for dinner and decided to try their curry chicken. It was delicious. They serve it with rice, french loaf or prata ($0.50 more). Rice is probably more filling but their bread was delicious and the prata is a treat that I don't get much in Canada. The pieces of chicken were generous although one of my pieces seemed a little overcooked (perhaps left over from previous order?) but the sauce was delicious. Definitely looking forward to getting it again and maybe even getting the spice pack to cook it at home. This is not an Indian curry, I think it's Hainan curry (don't quote me on that) which is more like a Japanese curry: creamy, tasty and not too (hot) spicy

I have been eating at killineu kopitiam in indonesia and singapore but never been at the one located on killiney road. Finally i made it here. We arrive on monday at 9:30am ish. We took taxi since we were too tired from the marathon on the day before. Soonest we arrive, we can see quite empy tables but still quite busy. We ordered directly at the cashier, menu is not too much variety but we gave it a try. Ordered kopi'o and boiled eggs and kaya french-toast. Soonest we paid, we sat on the table. Food were delivered around 10-15mins. Fresh and still warm.Tasted great! Love it. Perfect price, perfect spot and food. This is not the place u may wanna hang out too long or catching up for an hour or more bcs the place is quite busy and more perfect as a quick bite place.To get there by mrt:Take mrt and stop at sommerset station. exit towards 313 and walked heading to orchard getawaya mall. Killiney road will be right on the side of the building. Perhaps about 10-15 mins walk from somerset mrt.
3
Was staying nearby, so we made a trip here for our breakfast. It was packed with customers, luckily we got a spot near the wall (the space was kinda tight). We ordered Nasi Lemak (not bad, it comes with a fried fish but the samball was a bit spicy), Chee Cheong Fun (ok), Half boiled egg, Mee rebus and Otah-otah (both were pleasant)
2
This was an Asian Fast Food place. It has a limited menu, but the food was good. It usually is a very noisy place. You order at a counter then sit down. The food is brought to your table. We had a complimentary meal coupon, but I believe the prices are very reasonable. There was an extra charge for a napkin (I guess the napkin isn't included in the complimentary meal)
5
I had a chance to visit Killiney Kopitiam in the forum shopping mall branch. The shop is located in the underground floor near an exit. Ordered a bowl of Singapore Laksa (curry noodles) and lemon tea. Killiney Laksa turned out to be one of the best Laksa I had during my travel in Singapore. It has everything a proper meal should have, Good taste, Quality, Quantity and a reasonable price. The shop is small, clean and cute. I went there at 11 am and there weren't too much people. Really love this place 
4
Very efficient and fairly quick service. Nice and cheap,which I think everyone in the area knows as this place is frequently jam packed. Standard breakfast consists of 2 kaya (sweet spread) butter toast or 1 French toast, 2 (very) soft boiled eggs and 1 coffee or tea, usually made with condensed milk, so very sweet
5
We came here only for the kaya bread and was the best I try in Singapore. The butter was delicious and so the kaya.
4
It is famous for the nice coffee, toasted bread with kaya spread and butter. Nice ambience and the old school coffeeshop feel.
5
The kaya toast was great.
It can be rather crowded during peak hours, hence, getting a table might be a hassle.
3
Convenient and popular location for local tea/coffee plus kaya toast. Can get quite busy, but the last few times I've visited I haven't had an issue getting a table. Good place for a catch-up with friends, although it can get quite noisy.
4
I Like The French Toast and Coffee in here. But dont like the half boiled eggs, cause its toooo runny/watery. haaha
4
My accomodation provided a voucher to come to this coffee shop for breakfast. I'm glad they did. It was nice. Simple, local coffee, French toast with in house made coconut spread(kaya), soft boiled eggs. I noticed they also served, mee Siam, Nasi lemak and many other local favs. So definitely a place to go to if you staying close by. Prices are catered for the locals too!!
4
We were glad to be able to get a cup of hot coffee, local kaya toast and mee-siam at the airport recently when we were catching an early morning flight. So good to start the day with familiar comfort food served by a well-known brand in Singapore. Hope to see more such branches in other international airports soon
4
The hotel we stayed in gave us breakfast vouchers, redeemable here, for either kaya toast or french toast with 2 soft boiled eggs and coffee/tea. The taste was good, nothing to complaint about, nothing to write home either. Just like home cooked food :). The Kaya toast that I had every day, had plenty of coconut jam and butter, and was really yummy. I did find their kaya toast serving against a single voucher not enough to keep me full - but then I am a glutton ;). Since my husband never woke up early enough to make use of the vouchers, I used his voucher to order extra slices of kaya toast. A TIP: If you like the kaya jam, do buy a jar from them, they make it preservative-free... I forgot to buy, and am still kicking myself :(Service was prompt and friendly. When the cashier (co-owner?) took my order and I told him I didn't want any hot drinks, he gave me cold barley... which really helped my swollen feet (beware, walking 7,8 hours a day in Singapore will more likely cause this). I did not purchase any other item in the menu, so can't comment on them.... but I have to pass this place whenever I had to go/come from my hotel to the MRT, various times of the day, and it was always crowded. The place opens at 6am, and I could see people enjoying their breakfasts so early. Going by the crowd of locals, I'd imagine their other offerings are fine too :
2
Years ago the longing used to taste fresh, green beans, crunchy cabbage, freshly cooked rice cake but now longing looks a messy soggy, not as hot and a waste of money. Eat it when you are starving or in a desert island. LIme juice is alright
3
This is a chain of eateries that you can find all over Singapore. They serve toasted bread with kaya and butter, as well as eggs and tea or coffee. They also have other options such as mee siam, fried noodles and nasi lemak packets.It's a quick and easy meal for those on the go, from morning to night
3
I dropped by their stall at the airport to grab a quick bite before my flight. The prices were quite affordable considering that I was dining at the airport. However, don't expect high food quality. The taste was ok for the price though.
5
Opposite the Sing-Tel building on Killiney road. Pleasant efficient service, almost Hawker prices. In the 5 months we spent in Singapore this was my favourite Laksa, spicy and delicious, the coffee's not bad too.
5
For S$11 I ordered two soft boiled eggs, ice milo, coffee, French toast, chee cheongsam fun and toast with kaya
Bargain
Food Gomes out straight away
Tasty and fresh
Great ppl watching
For 30c I was able to doggy bag it
4
A classic restaurant in Singapore. Easy menu, but very tasty food and always keeping a quality standard. Not very elegant, tries to keep an old style, but is a place where you never get dissapointed
5
During the first two years of my stay in Singapore I stayed in the Orchard area. This Killiney was my regular stop off on the way to work for Kopi-o kosong and / or a GTO (ginger tea-o. They brewed it fresh there in the shop.) I appreciated the fact this location was the 'original' Killiney store and enjoyed getting to know Hazel, the owner Peter and several people working there. I was especially impressed that after going there regularly for just a few weeks they remembered what I drank and, upon my arrival in the shop, would automatically enter an order for me! The kopi was always nice and strong (just the way I like it) and the GTO was always nice. I really loved their half-boiled eggs and they also became my every Sunday stop for the a set of kopi-o, eggs and kaya butter toast-so yummy! Over the course of my 4 years in Singapore I tried the other chains that serve the same food but always found myself coming back here. Maybe Chin Mee Chin bakery on East Coast Road was close to the standard here. I wish Killiney was in the States. I miss it!
4
First night in Singapore and were staying just down the road. Picked this one out of a line of small eateries. Very basic but was clearly a small family run show. Basic and small menu. Apart from curried chicken and rice and a laksa we didn't really know what we might be eating. As it turned out both were excellent and our meal along with a couple of iced teas was less than what we have been paying for one persons main course on the rest of our holiday. No napkins(asked and was happily give a small packet of tissues) and was given a fork when they figured I would struggle to eat my laksa with chopsticks. Have noticed since, that every time we go past the place is packed out (often with a queue out the door).We thanked them for a nice meal and they seemed genuinely pleased that some foreigners had enjoyed the food. If you want to do it like the genuine locals- give this a g
4
This is the place to get the taste of the Singapore local breakfast. You will get to immerse in breakfast ritual of the locals.As you enter the restaurant, try to find a seat before you order, you need to inform the cashier your table no. Order the breakfast set that you prefer. The coffee, bread, and eggs are must-have, Char Kway Teow, literally "stir-fried ricecake strips", is another local favorite. Food are served fast and quality has been very consistent. Pick a place near the entrance and you get to watch people passing-by too. The place has a high turnaround time so plates will be cleared rather quickly.The restaurant is open full-day and they serve many other local dishes too. Really must try if you ever in Singapore and looking for a taste of local breakfast
2
Killiney Kopitiam is synonymous with good value for money food. Or so I once thought.This round of meals - the mee rebus did not taste like mee rebus at all. The gravy tasted strongly of oyster sauce. It looked dark brownish, too, just like oyster sauce had been added.I experienced it on 19 June 2014 at about 1.20pm at the Bedok Mall outlet. There were 5 covers at most, when I was there. I had to bring my Grass Jelly drinks from the counter to the table. The staff behind the counter said they will only bring the food items to us. Patrons who had finished their refreshments left behind used plates and cutlery which graced the tables when I arrived. Clearing tables is, apparently, not a priority. 2 staff were visible. 1 was the Order Taker. The other, made the drinks (which is self-serve to ones table) and brings the food to your table. Why drinks can't be served together with food by the wait staff? ... yes... its killing me to want to know too!My brother ordered Laksa. It came with diluted gravy.All in, an insipid, dull experience to be avoided at all cost in future. And the Grass Jelly drinks? Slightly better than insipid
4
Very delicious coffee, strategically located behind Orchard, it is just 5 minutes walk from Somerset MRT. Very scenic restaurant, I believe the building block has been preserved to keep the 'ancient' look of the restaurant rows. Tried French toast, prata bread with chicken curry and of course the coffee. All is very good, especially the coffee, prepared according to 'kopitiam way' just perfect without the taste of burned / overcooked coffee. Bought the sachet version of Killiney white coffee but hasnt tried it yet.. Pity the variety of food is limited
4
My wife and I come here every Sunday for Otah toast, French loaf, eggs and kopi. Sit and watch the diverse group of people that come to visit this spot. The team here is super consistent, and the staff is generally very friendly. Always a pleasure to visit
4
All the local classics- teh o, kopi o, soft boiled eggs, kaya toast or buttered toast. Mee Siam, curry chicken with French bread The grand -daddy of them all!
4
It said that the kopitiam located on Killiney Rd is the original one. To get here by MRT, alight at Sommerset Station. I love the coffee and half boiled egg is just perfect. Will go back there when I visit singapore again
2
The Laksa @ upper east coast is more like curry noddles, has the cook been changed? The cashier there put on a sulky face all the time. It is no longer the same killiney kopitiam that we used to know.
3
Serves one of the best local coffee in the area ... robust and well blended ...
Offering some of traditional rich tasting kaya (coconut) toasts ...
Nice place to stopover for coffee breaks ..
1
Unless you're that hungry & you can't really find any other place to buy food (which I doubt will ever be the case in Singapore), don't go here! The food is tasteless. Service is minimalist. Even the tea sucks. Price is not that cheap either.
4
Again, this is down memory lane in a classier way. Still, the coffee with buttered egg jam toast the best. And don't forget the half boiled eggs with pepper and light soya sauce!
4
Want a nice cup of kopitiam kopi at forum orchard where all the classy restaurant would not served than head down to ground floor tuck at one corner killiney kopitiam. Thy served simple lunch like rice and dishes n soup. Nice to find something local at Forum orchard
3
I have only been to the original shop on Killiney Road which is what this profile is for so I have no idea why a whole list of people are reviewing on here for the branches elsewhere?Anyway, for something like this my opinion is why go anywhere else but the original coloniel shop front in the heart of Singapore. I grew up in Malaysia but been living overseas for over 15 years and for me it's the memory of my childhood that brought me back here... On that front it's traditional in settings and menu traditional as well.. The coffee is authentic served in the same way my grandfather used to have his at the coffee shop with a deep saucer where my grandfather used to pour a little of his coffee in there o I can slurp from it :) of course I didn't do it here...The basic bread toast was lightly toasted and spread with butter and kaya (google it if you don't know what it is). The only thing I did not like is that you left the butter in a small cube rather then evenly spread like the kaya. The soft boil egg.. Is simple but that's what it's ment to be.. At 35 I still can't get soft boil eggs perfectly the way I like it.. They I'd it here.. I was delighted?All in all, good place and non pretentious.. If anyone want service and experience, go dine at a fancy restaurant as they are not trying to be that here.. Cost it wasn't too bad .. Yes wasn't cheap $5 for what i ordered but if you are so stress about this for implement things, make them at home? They have a comfortable environment with people serving so that's expected.. It is a business father all.
1
Terrible experience, I have to recognize that the staff is friendly, but the food you get for what you pay is a total rip off.I ordered Singapore noodles and my girl something else, 2 damn shrimps 2 damn little squid crap and maybe 30c bag of cheap noodles with some sauce, not bad for the sauce. and the price is more than 8 dollars.then they dare you clean when we are eating, I don't consider that as a bad habit, but the chemical smells horribly hideous that ruins your appetite.the service is very weird, it is self service, but there are plenty staff to deliver to the table which they don't, the only thing they deliver is main course. Man even MacDonalds provide better service and they don't have to move a fingerNEVER AGAIN
2
Their typical set, with two slices of Kaya toast, half boiled egg, and coffee is so-called better than most of the coffee shops around Singapore. But sorry to say this, but i think the food there are overrated and definitely overpriced .. same goes to their nasi lemak, mee siam and so on .. for me, i wont bother to go there again
3
Serves your regular fare of bread, & other staples. Food was nothing to rave about. Just ok. However, the prices are not that cheap. Granted, it's air-conditioned.
4
Great stop for a fix of Singapore coffee, hand-poured by the gallon through filters into proper copper coffeepots, a splash of sweet condensed milk, a cup of fresh, barely poached eggs, and some fat toast.
1
nothing is good here. not the food, not the drinks. go for ya kun kaya toast or toastbox instead, I actually prefer ya kun. lol
5
The malay style chicken curry and roti prata is unbelievably good! Best I've had in Malaysia or Singapore. The place is just a 3-4 minutes walk from Somerset MRT on Orchard Rd, everyone who likes curries or malay food should try this place.
1
烏節路ION的Killiney,女服務生態度非常差.In consideration of the Kaya Butter Toast being a specialty of Singapore, the food was mediocre; however, the attitude and demeanor of the staff was absolutely horrendous. The lady taking order was impatient and did not show any respect towards the customers. If you happen to pass by the store in Orchard Ion, then by all means, try the toast, but it is definitely not worth going out of your way to find
1
I'm sorely disappointed with Bedok Point's Killiney.The coffee maker (not barista) made a Coffee Sink instead of a Coffee Float. Upon presentation, she digged the ice cream out of the ice cubes for me to see, expecting me to accept her poor concoction.I was then served with meagre-sized Fish and Chips. There were 4 fragments of fish, which were a stark contrast from the menu which shows an outlay of a fish. There was no sauce. There were 10 baked beans, a spoonful of coleslaw, 1 slice of cucumber and tomato.When I gave feedback to the ill-trained staff, they were incapable of handling the situation. What's appalling is they claimed they don't have their manager's number and left the problem as it is.It isn't worth the value or the experience. Give it a miss
5
All the locals go here for breakfast so you may need to wait for a table. But the food is worth the wait. Excellent kaya toasts, boiled eggs and chicken curry - the best breakfast in Singapore. When you order the food you need to tell your table number, so find a place to sit first and then go to the counter. Also this place has "A" category so the place is very clean
4
Mee Siam, Mee Rebus, Chee Cheong Fun, Kaya Toast...just a couple of the absolute favourites that made the name Killiney Kopitiam a household name in Singapore. Simple interior, small tables packing about 50 people in one go. The food needs to be ordered at the counter and paid for right then and there (remember your table number). One of the above dishes sets you back about four singapore dollars, a tea is about a dollar thirty. You wonder why you ever spent more on a meal!
4
Whenever I travel, I make sure to find where the locals dine. They must be really good besides being reasonable. I went back to Killiney Kopitiam several times for their kotong laksa. It's very rich and sumptuous. They made use of chicken and hard boiled egg, no prawns. I even bought their laksa paste so that I can share them with my family back home. Their coffee, soft boiled eggs and thick kaya toast are indeed their national breakfast. Very affordable and typical kopitiam. I make sure I take a light breakfast in the hotel and looks for comfort food in Killiney Kopitiam in the day. When you get to try it once, am sure you'll come back for more
4
Killiney Kopitiam is an outstandingly down to earth place with simple, pleasurable local delights. The coffee they serve here is awesome. A must try for any visitor to Singapore to get a taste of what our local food use to taste like in the 1960s era. Simple, Straightforward and Delicious! Just go for it!
5
This is prob the signature of Singapore coffee culture
the kopi (local coffee), soft boil eggs (must try) and kaya bread (local jam) are to die for....
Buy a bottle of kaya back home - your family back home will love you for that
5
Try it, and you will love it ;)
I tried nasi lemak and Mie Laksa together with it famous coffee and teh tarik. I couldn't say more. I like it!
4
i went to the original killiney near orchard. it's always packed with guest. the coffee & the toast is great. i also order curry and mee siam, both was good.
4
Great way to the morning in Changi , Half boiled eggs, kaya kun toast and Coffee-O..was a boost for the day
2
The glutinous rice ball didn't taste fresh, the soup was so diluted I didn't even get to taste the ginger in it.
5
It's my 2nd time in Singapore and I passed this coffee shop many times and ignored it. I realized it was a mistake not giving it a try! Their coffee is way way way better than Starbucks and other posh coffee shop. I forgot to mention that it is also very very very CHEAP. Their Kaya Toast with Butter is a perfect match with their coffee. Before trying it out, we had a eaten a feast in a posh Korean place but didn't mind that I was full cause it was so appetizing that I need to try it again and again. Never miss a chance to try it out. TWO THUMBS UP!!! :
5
Must try breakfast for S$ 3.00. A 2 soft boiled egg + Toast with Kaya + Coffee or Tea.It was a delightful experience though needs your patience because of the long que whatsoever it was a worth waiting. I had coffee which is so unique better than Starbucks or famous coffee chain I guess it has a combination of fresh coffe and a bit of cacao beans,truly heaven. A soft boiled eggs, cracked it put soy sauce, salt and pepper...yumyum + 2 pieces of Kaya Toast
4
Can't imagine what the reviewer who called the originally Killiney Kopitiam, on Killiney Rd., was thinking. "Dingy"? Not at all; it seemed quite tidy and clean to us. "Offering slop..." Where did this guy eat? We dropped by for lunch. It was bustling; all customers other than us appeared to be locals. Is that the sign of a bad place? I had nasi lemak. It came pre-prepared, wrapped in a banana leaf pyramid. I generally prefer my nasi lemak made for me when I order, but this was pretty darn good. The sauce was tasty and just right-spicy. The ikan bilis was a little bit chewy, rather than the all-too-common rock hard. A small fried fish was a nice additional touch. My companion had chicken curry with rice. I tasted the curry sauce and thought it was outstanding, as did she. Generous amount of meat and potatoes included. My nasi lemak was just a little over S$2;the chicken curry (really, enough for 2) was less than S$6. Service was efficient, if not exactly overflowing with bonhomie. A Singapore institution since 1919, and for good reason
1
Made our way to killeney- koptiam after reading the recommendation in Lonely Planet guide. I would preface my review by saying that we were not looking for posh food or surroundings and that we love all forms of eastern food and have eaten from street stalls and cafe's across Thailand, Cambodia and Bali. I say this to avoid the thought that this review is about expectation.In summary it was a dingy cafe offering slop and service without cheer. My suspicion is that it survives on the label of being the first of its name which allows it some mystique and trendiness.Good points>cheapBad points>Dingy and lacking any character - reminded me of a greasy cafe I used as a student in Leicester.> slopped out food that was lacking interest. Think school dinner> miserable staff who dumped the food on the table without a smile or a word
5
this shop prides itself for being the first breakfast cafe in Singapore. It is all day breakfast dining area. A plate of toast with butter and coconut jam. two soft boiled eggs, and a cup of coffee will only cost you US$3 and it is available anytime of the day. Worth to try
4
Similar to Ya Kun Kaya Toast, the traditional toast here is amazing too! The traditional black coffee is addictive!
5
Best coffee in Singapore that I know of. The kaya is also very nice.
4
Good for local breakfast of kopi (coffee) and egg and toast in a nice clean airconditioned environment (as compared to the hawker centre).
2
coffee is expensive for coffee shop, and doesnt compare with the nearby random coffee stalls at Amoy Street food centre even.
4
If you want to try local breakfast, this place and Ah Kun are the best place to go. They serve eggs with toast bread (with local spread) and local coffee or tea. Give it a try.
5
Has great coffee and tea prepared the local traditional style. I think it has one of the best coconut jam on toast in Singapore. I like the chicken curry with bread at this cafe.
4
I think it changed hands recenly but the premise is the same. I love to take visiting guests for kaya toast and the strong coffee. A boiled egg or french toast is more substantial or the mee rebus for something more substantial
5
Killiney is one of Kopitiam (coffee shop) with quite a lot of branches in Singapore. Dishes are delicious and there are special enough Kaya Toast. Price was reasonable, rapid serving, good service.If you just want to taste Kopitiam in Singapore, try there. You spend enough SGD4-
5
I had been reading about this coffee shop before coming to Singapore and I was ecstatic to learn that it is conveniently across the road from where we were staying. The kaya toast and kopi on a good October morning is perfect to jumpstart your day. At 6 AM, the place was already packed
4
I can definitely recommend going to Killiney Kopitiam for the classic Kaya toast and Kopi O (as well as other local dishes). Make sure to go to the original on Killiney Road itself - definitely the best. It's a no frills inexpensive fare and the service can be a bit short at the best of times, but this all adds to the experience
5
Must tries - kaya toast (white bread), barley (home made)
A small cup of coffee in the morning is enough to keep the office workers up and about for the entire day; it is "gao gao" (very thick/heavy).
3
Coffee is good at their shop in Killiney Road, and toasted bread is very tasty and goes well with their half boiled eggs. Can get very crowded during weekends.
3
Killiney Kopitiam has a good consistency of good food. Recommended dishes includes the curry - it's a bit spicy.
4
Great mee sium & meerabus noodles, excellent value, but venue way too small so had to get takeaway
3
Try the original location at the Killiney Road and you'll experience an authentic Singaporean way to start your day. Food is average but the experience of jostling your way for a breakfast in a local eatery is worth the try.
5
The best place to eat in Terminal 1 Changi (could it be the best place to eat in any terminal 1?)Unpretentious, freshly prepared food and a great iced coffee for under 6 dollars Singapore.
Service fast and efficient, Laksa beautifully seasoned. Loved it!
3
Maple Syrup French Toast and Kopi Peng!
3
Love the kaya!

I have picked out hair from my dish more than once here

This kopitiam is marked on travel website, so we thought it will be worth a try. Well...First, the staff is not friendly. I'm not a person with a morning temper, but staff there had kind of spoiled my breakfast mood. We stood there and wandered around for couple of minutes, but there was no one coming up to us to ask what would we need. Instead, the staff was sitting down and doing nothing. Any customer could be having their first time visiting the restaurant and not familiar with the menu. It's a basic obligation for a service provider to be attentive. Every customer should enjoy a standard level of service for what they had paid, even though it's just a cup of coffee. Second, nasi lemak is cold. It's kind of intolerable for a Malaysian like me...If there is next time, i'll rather go to the normal kopitiam situated at the beginning of Liang Seah Street. The coffee, breads and even eggs are so much better, They certainly served a good nanyang style of breakfast at a cheaper price
