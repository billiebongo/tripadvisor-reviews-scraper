Loved this place. Was desperate for healthier options after pigging out on Singapore's delicious gastronomy. This did not disappoint! Great choices, fresh ingredients, and friendly service. Go there

Chanced upon this salad bar when I was looking to grab a light meal around Bugis after my workout and since then it had became my regular go to place for salads!I would always go for the $6.50 'pick-your-own-salad' as I prefer to mix my own greens amid eggs and pastas. Place is not too crowded on Saturdays and after office hours on weekdays, best suited for those who would like some quiet and peace to enjoy their salads

This is my favourite place to get a bite after working out at the nearby gym because it not only serves healthy salad at an affordable price, I get to enjoy my meal in peace away from the busy Bugis area on a weekend. Might not be easy to find - it's tucked away along the corridor between Bugis East-West line and Downtown line stations.

Had patronize the shop to buy take away salads for more than 10 times over the last 3 months.However there were more than 3 times than I had trouble getting attention of the service staff whenever there is no crowd. There were people behind the counter just standing and looking (obviously they are aware that someone is waiting) but no one ask what you would like to order, until you need to do something to catch the staff attention.This evening it was really frustrating, there isn't any queue in front of me. 4 staff behind the counter. 1 at cashier, 1 helping with the previous customer prepare salads, the other 2 just simply stand around. Had stand in front of the ordering counter for more than 2 mins, ask can I order at 2 mins +, probably another 1 min waiting. Total almost 5 mins. No one bothers to take your order or even acknowledge that you are there asking you to hold on while they are trying to settle their on hand stuff. This is my first time experiencing such weird customer service where service staff stands behind the counter and yet ignore the the person trying to order. Mostly importantly, there is no queue.
