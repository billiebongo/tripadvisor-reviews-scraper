Pretty good food. Pleasant surprise to find this place which is so hidden! Good wings! Pasta done al dente, but was a little too salty, pizza was perfect, Pork ribs tender, steak and chicken combo pretty good too.

Our favourite place for a weekend dinner. Good food and reasonable price. Must try is prime rib and clam chowder in a lump of bread. I think the draft hoegaarden is also rare find in western part of Singapore. Buffalo wing a delicious.

This restaurant has nice Aussie food and prices are reasonable. Heard they move and not sure whether their prices are still affordable

Firstly location was a priority and Buckaroo was recommended. Secondly, didn't know what to expect...We were a dinner part of 6 - booked through HGW...Buckaroo is located directly opposite ESSO along Upper Bukit Timah / Woodlands Road, near the Bukit Panjang / Choa Chu Kang flyover. It is inside the Khek or Hakka Community Club, next to an Indian Hindu temple.Service was homey, not your typical polished service, but still decent. I appreciated the waiter (looked like the boss) offering to do half of the wings with sauce and the other half without - we had some of us who cannot take spicy food. This was nice.Food-wise... We had:A full dozen of chicken wings - half sauced and the other without. Not bad, though slightly on the overcooked side. Flavour was good - especially the naked wings.A full slab of BBQ pork ribs - OK, nothing great. Simple BBQ sauce and the meat was a tad on the dry side.Salami and Cheese pizza - thin crusted, well-seasoned, nice slices of salami and this is something I would recommend.Cock and Bull - yes, cock and bull - Chicken Chop with a 180g Rib Eye Steak! Actually found the steak to be good. However at $49.80... a little steep.Spaghetti Aglio Olio - Pasta was slightly over al-dente, loads of mushroom... but a little salty.Spaghetti Marinara - Sweet, seafood (mussels, prawns, fish) was cooked separately and then assembled - except for the squid. OK, passable, but will not order it next time.Next time??? Not sure.Total Bill $182... No service charge... no drinks... $30 per person

I put effort to assure me what food to have or not to have (not all the restaurants are willing to do) since I'm allergic to soy, nuts and sesame. Yea, things went pretty smooth except I had gastritis so couldn't enjoy it fully. I will return for the mushroom soup and of course the onion rings!

The decor is simple but the food is value for money. Like the onion rings which you will find real onion in it. The smoked duck pizza is a family favorite. The duck meat wasn't too dry and the pizza is thin. The staff is friendly and there is a corner for the kids to be entertained too. It has a miniature table soccer set for the kids. Had a steak during the last trip there, and it was nicely done to our liking, but found there was too much fat in it. A great place for family, kids friendly

The same old good onion rings which is crispy on the outside, juicy onion in the inside. Very delicious and tasty. The buffalo wings are just nice, level four and above are too spicy for most people. The parking is limited, and due to the construction of the new roads, it can be tricky to finding the buildin

Great food that makes you want to keep coming back for more. Some of the food which we like are the salmon steak that is cook just right to retain the juices, chicken wings with variable level of chilli that makes you want to keep trying for hotter levels, and real calamari rings which are fried just right. Only drawback is the car parking which is really limited and quite squeezy.The staff are friendly and take the time to recommend dishes to new comers. The tables are adequately spaced which is great for conversation. All in all, we always have a great time when we come here for dining.Miss the old location. Oh well

i visited this restaurant twice this month or 5 times this year. In recent visit, I experienced good steak served by them, 280 g and 500 g in size for big meat eater. The steak is juicy and thick, unless some other commercial establishment. Ceaser Salad is nice too but the one come with chicken strip has chicken served in soup. Very reasonable pricing and friendly service. Snack or finger food are nice too besides a few types of imported beer. It is a place I would visit again in near future.
