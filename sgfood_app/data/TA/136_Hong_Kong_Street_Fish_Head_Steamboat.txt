You must try their claypot curry fish head, prawn paste fried chicken, 三捞, Thai sauce fish chunk with rice, salty egg crabs.
Fast, hot and tasty!

We ordered their Mee Tai Mak, Qing Long Cai and Mongolian Toufu.Mee Tai Mak - tasted so-so. Nothing special to comment.Qing Long Cai - nice but slightly salty. Medium size cost $15. Expensive.Mongolian Toufu - recommended by the waitress. Supposed to be chef recommended. Tasted funny - black pepper taste with sweetness. We cannot accept the taste.Our first time and last time here.Total cost is $53.30.

The food was super nice especially the fish head steamboat. Just the TripAdvisor map showing us the wrong direction but the address was right. It great food and at reasonable price.The uncle that took our order like he is having a bad day haha.Beside the uncle service it was great

Their speciality is the red pomfret fish head steamboat. Good value and the taste of freshness with a strong charcoal aroma lingers in the mouth when you drink the soup.The small size pot is good enough for 2 to 3. Other dishes are not too bad but I still prefer their speciality.It would be good to book in advance to prevent waiting for the table for too long.The new location is relatively far from accessible train station. So you might need to make more time to travel there

Go for their off-the-menu Claypot Mee Tai Mak at only $5 and unbelievably satisfying. And their Boss (Prawn) Bee Hoon.This braised clay pot beehoon is filled with flavour, soft and a treat to the palette! Small portion at $15, it's reasonable and value for money

visited the one actually at 136 hong kong st with a group of 10.because of our large group, it made more economic sense to order many dishes. we ordered 6 dishes, all medium portions, and drinks. the bill came to $8.50 per person.recommended: mongolian pork ribs, 3-egg spinach. gan ziang chicken was more deep fried batter and skin doused in sweet sauce than chicken meat

They served very nice food at a very affordable price that won't burn a hole in your wallet. Service was fast and foods were served fast.I particularly love their fish soup and salted egg stir fried chicken, very delicious. Wasabi prawn was also nice.I would definitely recommend this place.

This place is renowned for good Cantonese dishes - prawn paste chicken, salted egg squid, fish head steamboat, pork rib king, steamed fish to name a few.I usually call to order and pop by to collect later.Simply because the place has zero sound ventilation. With just 2-3 tables of diners, the sound level will become unbearable.You have been warned. Otherwise, just enjoy the food
