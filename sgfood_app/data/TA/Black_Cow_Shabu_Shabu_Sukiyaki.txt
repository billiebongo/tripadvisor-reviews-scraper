You have seen the photos before. The taste is as explosive as expected. The price is really quite a tug, so spend your time here wisely.
I would definitely go back for more!! The staff were kind and helpful, the atmosphere were comfortable.

Overpriced and the manager was too pushy.. he wanted us to order more than we could eat. Food quality was so so.. the uni foie gras premium gyudon truffle was too overrated.. i expected more before coming to this place.. but the uni was tasteless, the japanese rice was not the best quality japanese rice i ve ever tasted. If you want to charge premium price for the food, youâ€™d better improve the food quality and service.

I just returned from Takayama Japan and was pleased to see this restaurant serve Hida Beef on her menu. The Shabu Shabu Set comes with small bowl of salad, small appetisers, a set of fresh vegetables, 150g of Hida Beef and Waffle served with Vanilla Ice Cream. The set costs $198.The quality of beef is good, but the same portion of beef will cost 3 times lesser in the few renowned restaurants which I reviewed in Trip Advisor for Hida Beef in Takayama.We also ordered a single serving of Don Buri too. It comes with Caviar, Uni, Foe Grais, Onsen Egg, A5 Kagoshima Beef and Rice. This bowl costs $108.This place is great for Business Lunches and Dinners

Starter : Japanese saladMain : classic Foie Gras Bifuteki DonDessert: choice of Yuzu, matcha or sesame ice cream The star lies in the Main. It was very very good. Honestly, it is a tad pricey. I can get very very good quality lunch sets at this price. At Michelin-rated Restuarants! You gotta really like your beef to pay this price. Servers are a little pushy on the expensive dishes and sides, and you have to politely decline. Decor: Modern JapaneseFree wifi: Yes. But with such good food & pricing, focus on savouring your food. I will come again for special occasions / treat.

Here at Black Cow, you can probably find the best, and authentic sukiyaki in Singapore. We ordered one set of Sukiyaki with Oumi A5, and a plate of Kagoshima beef. They served the appetizer first, Japanese cucumber, wagyu beef spring roll like, and salad. Sukiyaki broth was very authentic I would say, from a Japanese pout of view, and beef was very tender. If you are looking for those beef which melt in your mouth, this is the place you are looking for. The staffs were very attentive, they took a very good care of us. It happened to be my birthday that night, and all the staffs wished me happy birthday! This restaurant is a must if you are looking for some authentic Japanese Sukiyaki!

I went there solo for a quick lunch and order their executive set lunch. The wagyu beef comes in 2 options the A3 and A5. I order the wagyu with foie gras which was very good.Although the salad and ice cream dessert that comes with the set was nothing special

Dinner for 2. Ambience: Modern and sleek interior. You wouldn't think it was serving Japanese at first impression until you notice the hotpots and induction cookers.Food: We ordered the Sukiyaki and Bonburi. The food was definitely good, but I was still abit disappointed by the execution of the dishes. The donburi was a little too "watery" and the shabu shabu average. But they try to make it up with generous offers of ingredients. The beef is really good and the donburi with Foie Gras / Truffles / Uni had a wonderful flavour combination that was really satisfying.Service: Errrrrrrr.......for the price tag why is the restaurant not hiring good service staff? They are helpful but the younger staff seem to be thrown into the deep end of the pool. Struggling to keep up with the service tempo while being "corrected" by the more experienced staff right at the table.Overall: Food is good, no doubt about it. But it just isn't worth the price

How can you beat this bowl of goodness? We were planning our next visit even before we finished the bowl of donburi. Even a 9 year old appreciated the taste of all the excellent ingredients in this somewhat small highly priced dish of yumminess!The wagyu sukiyaki was also amazing but there was nothing to shout about the shabu shabu. But no matter, the smallest bowl of food won the day

Black Cow is a small restaurant with an understated ambience. But don't let it fool you. Amazingly fresh food and tender wagyu beef presented within a diverse tempting menu. The premium wagyu foie gras don is a must-try dish. The sake menu is varied and we thoroughly enjoyed the sake expert's recommendation, a delicate dry sake nicely chilled. The sukiyaki and shabu-shabu were well prepared by staff. An almost perfect meal. Note it's a SGD$100+ meal but definitely worth returning to try other menu dishes

Order the more expensive Premium Wagyu Donburi as there is really a difference between the more expensive wagyu & the less expensive wagyu. Can't complain much about the price because almost everything's imported from Japan and good portion too. Particularly love the yuzu ice cream at the end of our meal
