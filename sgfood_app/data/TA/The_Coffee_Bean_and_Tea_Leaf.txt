Was hard to find good coffee in Singapore especially worth the price, wish i tried this place before the last day
Breakfast cheap but below average wouldn't have again

When you need good coffee when travelling, this is it. Loved it, great coffee, good friendly service. Good snacks and a nice clean setting. Very nice.

It's ok, good from a far but far from good.i would recommend for a coffee only. There aren't that many good choices in this airport where they have gone for the lowest common denominator.

Had to wait 20 minutes for two Cappuccinos, with no one else in line before us. No choice of muffins.
Coffee still ok

I'm a regular here when in Singapore. The coffee and tea are better than starbucks and the breakfast and lunch menu provides a nice mix of local and "western' dishes that I enjoy.

Visited Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf for breakfast.
Melted cheesy egg with ham sandwich with salad is really tasty. Warm English Breakfast tea made it perfect.
Enjoyed. Nice meal at average price.

First order was like milky dish water. Asked for the coffee to be re-made. Second attempt only marginally improved. After a couple of mouthfuls decided to leave it .... Definitely wouldn't get a job as a Barrista in Melbourne!!!!

Great place for daily coffee either take out or take there. The coffee beans do not seem overly burnt hence the coffee is quite smooth. The drip coffee is the one I go for. The staff tends to remember you when you stop by often and that is nice too. Only item that perhaps could improve is the level of music as at times it is quite loud when there are only few customers in there. Not a big deal but a detail for improvemen

If you are a bit tired of food courts, go there. It was my first western meal after two weeks and I loved it, I felt at home.Ordered the Smoked Salmon Sandwich and it came on a tasty bagget with tasty & refreshing salad on the side. Best meal I've had so far (considering I didn't fall for the local cuisine)

Yep, this seems to be one of the coffee shop chainstores that are beginning to dominate the market. It isn't anything all that fantastic, but if you want a quick cup of coffee then this place certainly does the job. Mind you,I wouldn't expect anything all that fantastic, though it does have a much better atmosphere, and set up, than Starbucks, but then again that actually isn't all that hard
