Similar to yakun, killiney and toast box, they serve local breakfast and neal items. Normal, apart from the leaky soy sauce bottle that made a bit of a mess, luckily not on me

Good portions of local fare, e.g. chicken rendang, mee siam, beef noodles etc. Not forgetting the toast and runny egg set meals. Coffee and tea rather weak, though. Fairly affordable with mains starting at S$4.

Was at Terminal 1 when we chanced upon Kaffe and Toast. Decided to have a quick breakfast there.
Ordered the breakfast value meal kaya toast set A, set D and the local delight Chee Cheong fun.
Overall a simple, no-fuss meal.

Visited the outlet at Clementi Mall. The Thai Grilled chicken rice is really tasty. The Mee Siam and Noodles as well.

It is one of few coffee shops inside airport terminal. I have nice breakfast with tea before budget flight.

The food served and prepared fast. The quality rather average for a hungry traveller just landed in Singapore.

Quick meal that you could find in the Changi airport. The toast and the half boiled egg is okay, and the hot milk tea is great!

If you just need something to tide you over then go for a strawberry muffin or sugar toast. 2.20 for each. I would wait until you are inside the airport for anything more substantial.

Eggs: The eggs they serve are soft-boiled and these are really soft. If you don't like really runny eggs, skip them.Coffee: I like black unsweetened coffee and the only place I was able to enjoy this was when I made it myself in my hotel room. This is mostly my fault when ordering, they don't ask. Be specific on your preference. By default you will get sweetened condensed milk added
