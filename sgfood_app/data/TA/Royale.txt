Love e fact that this buffet restaurant is not crowded w people. We had a quiet n enjoyable family time w some awesome spread of s’pore delicacy n Nyonya food (Chilli crab, popiah, laksa, etc). No queueing needed.

Booked a table for 12. There were no people when we reached there. Decor was just as what the restaurant name suggests. Limited variety of food compared to other buffet venues we went but couldnt complain because of the price. Food was decent.

The cooked food is good and seafood consists of prawn and oyster are very fresh however the dessert area needs improvement.

Went for the lunch buffet 1 for 1 on a Monday. The restaurant is nicely decorated and food neatly displayed. The food there is nice, not fantastic. No complains for $20 per pax.

Lots of choices which include fresh oysters & prawns, sushi, as well as laksa. Very nice ambience with good service from the staff.

Overall a pleasant meal with decent fare. Opted for a 1-1 deal on Chope and it was pleasant based on the ambience and offered food. Will recommend!

The buffet spread is decent but not wide enough. However, Every dish is well prepared and delicious. There are not many waiters/waitresses and you need to prompt them to clear the dishes.

I guess I am used to better Peranakan food and so the Royale Peranakan buffet dinner was disappointing as most of the flavors were not authentic. I also remember that the satay was cold, even at 6.45pm. It was my first time at Royale and I’m not at all sure if I will ever return. There are loads of better places to eat in Singapore for the money spent. Both food wise and service wise.

We went when they were running a 1-1 promotion. Variety of food is really little for buffet! Short of manpower definitely. Couldn’t find a single staff when needed. And Chef in charge of cooking laksa is always not there. No other cold drinks except tea, coffee and iced water. If there is no promotion, I would encourage to try other places.

We came on a Sun afternoon and the place was very crowded. However, service was very good and the food were replenished fast. There is a good variety of food and the prawns were fresh. The place was spacious with comfortable seats. Will consider visiting again when there is a promotion
