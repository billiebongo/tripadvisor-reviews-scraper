Wide selection of dishes to choose from. There is something for almost everyone's tastes. Food arrived pretty quickly. Found it a great place to grab a quick bite. Easy in and out.

toast box served as the perfect alternative to the typical and chaotic complimentary buffet breakfast at most hotels. delicious toast and eggs with milky indian-style tea was a godsend. i liked the pager provided to the customer which buzzes when the order is ready.

The food here is a bit basic and not the best but it is perfectly acceptable and useful when you are in a hurry, passing through this busy area. It is for a quick drink and something small to eat to keep you going. I have used it several times and never been disappointed. It is what it is

Came here for some tea and toast this week after lunch. Timed the arrival well to avoid the queue, and managed to get the tea fairly quickly with the toast following a few minutes later. But shortly after the queue looked quite long. Tea and toast both pretty standard: no complaints

I didn't know this place was so popular between locals. I tried the ham and cheese on toast with a large black coffee and two boiled eggs. It all tasted very good and was reasonably priced at 6.50 SGD. Fast service. The decor is quite nice too, white, clean and minimalist. Next time I'll try the Kaya toast and the Kopi C

We went to this chain at least twice, different locations. The first time at Bugis we had a small meal, pandan cake and peanut butter toast with coffee. My friend really enjoyed the peanut butter toast and had it again at this location at esplanade. I was more adventurous and tried the Laksa, which was very good. I really like this chain. And when you don't know where and what to eat, this is a good choice as their menu is handle-able and you get a good Singaporean experience. I came to love Singapore coffee and they make it good here. Watch them with their long-necked pots and deep filters.

Compared to other places in Singapore food is very cheap here however the soup we ordered was practically inedible for us....We like trying local culinary specialties during our travels but it did not work this time. Unfortunately I could not tell if it was our fault or the food was presented poorly as we gave up further experiments and ended up in a nearby Mcdonald's..

Visited Toast Box Telok Ayer Bad service. They served me cold eggs and I asked for hot one, the worker looked as if he hated me so much. He dip it in hot water for a while. Still almost raw eggs. Poor quality food - hot coffee is only about 40 degree celcius, eggs are almost raw!Expensive - S$4.90 for a Toast set like this, which is charged at a premium
3
I had some sort of french toast from here, filled with a sweet custard filling! Whilst this isn't my usual choice for breakfast, it made a nice change and would cater to those with a sweet tooth.Prices are very cheap, although there are long lines so there can be a wait
3
Came here for dinner and ordered the Sweet n Sour chicken. There's very very little gravy and hence can't taste the sweet and sourness except for that few slices of pineapple. It tasted more like pop corn chicken...
4
Located in the mall, this food outlet provides awesome Singapore specialties like toast with Kaya, Toast with golden lava, etc. Their tea and coffee is also very flavorful and tasty. Visit when you want a bite of Singapore toasts.
5
This is a really cool place. It's always crowed! This place has great food! We went in to escape the heat and to me it's a hidden gem!!
4
It is not easy to find nice brunch food by the marina area that is affordable. Toast Box at Esplanade is one of them.
3
This place serves local fast food...like McDonald's etc...
Go to a Neighbourhood hawker centre for more authentic local food....
5
the curry chicken is the best followed those local delicacies such as mee rebus, mee siam, etc... the tea break cake and coffee were nice too.
4
We like their laksa and the Kaya toast, however portions are quite small.
The tea Tarik is pretty good as well.
Good place to meet up with friends for a chat as well.
3
The portion of the food is on the smaller side, price is more expensive than you eating the same things in food court
2
Very disappointed with the poor customer service from the guy taking order. He was impatient and rude. We were ordering for a party of 5 for noodles and drinks. He should realise we the customers is paying his wages. Noodles was average but the cheese and mushroom toast was below average. I will give 2.5 for food and 1 for service. Will I go back? No

We visited this cafeteria on our first afternoon in Singapore downtown. We did not know that majority of restaurants stop serving lunch at 2 pm, so this was a good option for late lunch. We had two hot drinks, chicken curry and egg&ham toast for 15 SGD. Good value for money
3
Visited the outlet at Suntec for some roast pork noodles for lunch (which came with a barley water). Fairly small serving but tasty. Popular venue and getting a seat at lunchtime wasn't entirely easy.
4
Fabulous Tea and Kopi place in Singapore, with tasty butter-toast options to go. This chain is ubiquitous in Singapore and is a great breakfast and lunch option for the locals.
3
just ordinary laksa,maybe because i dont really like santan(coconut paste)...and quite pricey for this standard food.
5
Very efficient restaurant. Good selection of food to choose from. Best Earl Grey tea outside on England.

Was just looking for a morning cup of coffee and stumbled upon the Toast Box. Toast set 3 is Multigrain Floss Thick Toast that I ordered after learning that the Singapore treat called Floss is Rousong, which is also known as meat wool, meat floss, pork floss, flossy pork, pork sung or yuk sung, is actually a dried meat product with a light and fluffy texture similar to coarse cotton that originated in China. The two soft boiled brown eggs cooked to perfection really enhance the Texas toast with its nice even brown toasting covered with Floss. The menu shows a cup of coffee with the set but I was still asked what drink I would prefer with my set. My response of traditional coffee generated the request of thin, thick, extra thick, condensed milk, evaporated milk, sugar, less sweet or more sweet. The gentleman behind me suggested Kopi which he explained is coffee with condensed milk. Kopi in Malay language means “Coffee” but my western brain wonders why the milk then? I had not seen traditional Singapore coffee prepared before using the unique long & narrow neck Singapore coffee brewing pots skillfully designed for easy pouring & maneuvering and long wide coffee strainers. I was mesmerized by the dancing pots as the Barista made a fresh pot of coffee. The gentleman behind me asked if I had noticed the traditional Barista’s pants had no pockets to prevent him from pocketing sales. The location is excellent even for those in the 4 & 5 star hotels. The atmosphere is clearly open and friendly for business people wanting an economical break. I recommend tourists learn the unique Singapore coffee lingo first so you may order a cup of coffee that meets your taste because I am more of a Kopi O Kosong than a Kopi drinker

Just coming back from Singapore and already missing the tasty coffee and tea.Also the breakfast menu is highly to recommend.Where else can you get coffee, toast and eggs together for under $5.00.Toast Box has heaps of outlets in Singapore and it is worth a visit.We visited around 5 different Branches while holidaying. Every single store was great.My Husband said he had the best coffee ever....

Toast Box has several branches in Singapore including the one at Clementi Mall and Esplanade Mall at Esplanade Theatres on the Bay at Raffles Ave. This cafe serves coffee , tea, barley and local dishes like Mee Siam. The price is reasonable and the service is good. Waiting time is about 5 minutes and you have a chair to sit and a table for your food. The ambience is good and the place is not overcrowded.The price is still cheaper than what you pay at Starbucks, Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf and even the famous Ah Kun Kaya Toast which is giving Toast Box a run for their money. This cafe is popular with Singaporeans and Malaysians who come here for a drink and to eat the kaya toast. You get value for what you pay. I visit this place on weekends whenever I am free

there are toast box restaurants everywhere. i believe it is a well done knock off from the original ya kun kaya toast. i prefer toast box for some reason as it seemed newer, younger and fresher than ya kun which was older, older people working there and just old. the coffee Kopi-C specifically was excellent but sometimes a bit sweet so better served cold with ice. tried the pork floss on bread with the slightly cooked but raw eggs. also every delicious. the bakery items were great to try. for lunch, (i had ate at toast box more than any restaurant in singapore) i tried the the laksa which was also delicious. its noodles and fried tofu in a spicy coconut soup. very convenient except for some places which will have long lines for coffee. very interesting to see the coffee man prepare a drink as it is quite entertaining and different from your typical starbucks

If you want traditional Singapore coffee (Kopi) and breakfast this is the place for you.The service is quick & friendly; the price is cheap & the coffee is the best I have had in Asia. It's fun watching them make the coffee too - an art in itself.Suggest trying Set 1: Traditional Kaya Toast. The Kopi-C (Coffee, milk & sugar) is delicious & I don't normally have sugar in my coffee! The Kaya toast is kaya jam & butter - so tasty! The eggs are soft boiled so be prepared when you crack them. Apparently they are best with the brown sauce & pepper - I only found this out after I had eaten there so missed out but enjoyed them plain none the less. We also tried the peanut butter toast and ham & cheese toasted sandwich - both delicious.Highly recommend!

this was in the basement of suntec city mall.very strange offerings. appeared very popular at all the outlets we passed but not my cup of tea.Ate here once and would not rush back, there appears to be loads of competition in Singapore for food venues and some if it us much better than thus. Had chicken and rice dish which was ok and there bakery products are not as nice as the competition (see other reviews) the food was very cheap but the drinks were not what I was expecting
4
Tea with condensed milk, kaya toast and half boiled egg with soya sauce. Strange but fantastic combination. A great option for an evening snack..
4
You can go here anytime of day to grab a quick bite to eat. Quality of the food is consistent. Like their peanut butter toast and laksa.
4
These guys are super consistent. I love the peanut butter toast and that's what attracts me to Toast Box each time. The service is a little too mechanical though.
3
I have tried Laksa and coffee. It is recommended if you want a good food at a reasonable price. The service was good and quick.
4
We decided to try a Kaya toast set which came with Kaya toast, coffee and two eggs. Coffee and toast were great (especially the butter!) but we found that we just could not eat the eggs. The tradition is to have them just cooked and very runny and this just did not sit well with our palates. The actual restaurant was clean (as is everything in Singapore) and had a lovely atmosphere. I would definitely recommend trying the Kaya toast if visiting Singapore

I'm a regular visitor to the various Toast Box outlets in the central districts in Singapore. Always quite good value, although I find the process of having to line up to order and pay first to be quite troublesome - I prefer those places which offer table service at a similar price. Today we tried the Tea Loft outlet of Toast Box in the Ion mall. This one was quite decent as the queue was short (on a Friday lunchtime) and there was plenty of seating available
4
we dine for this restaurant and we find the ramen noodles so nice to eat. and we also ordered the toast sandwich it is served with 2 soft boiled egg with a milk tea. the service is fast and you have plenty of sandwiches to choose
5
I liked the traditional kaya toasts and the eggs served here. ThanksDear friends out there at toast box that you care what we need to eat Ann instant energy boosters for me. I loved my coffee,boiled eggs and of course the sweet kaya toasts.cost is reasonable,taste is good what else you want for filling your stomach!

You can almost see Toast Box all around Singapore, the first time I tried was at Esplanade Mall... so many people lunch there... then I ordered their signature dish, a bowl of Laksa and a glass of Barely... wow.. amazing, they cooked it fresh, the noodle was soft and elastic, the soup is very nice, I can taste the tasty shrimp on the soup, The price was also so cheap for that quality... now I am hungry everytime I remember the taste hohoh... Must try when you re in Singapore

After exhausted walking along esplanade center, I accidentally found the toast box@esplanade in here.I ordered peanut butter toast, which is one of their famous and homemade barley. The toast is really average and nothing special compared to the toast you make at home. But the barley is really good!!! Wash our all your thirsty with smooth texture & slight sweetness.!Overall, it's a good place to take a little rest during your trip :
