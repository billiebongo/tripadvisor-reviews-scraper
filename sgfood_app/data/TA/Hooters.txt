What do you expect? Wings, girls and beers. The wings, burgers and tacos we shared were decent enough, and drinks were cold. Service was efficient.
5
We enjoyed that food very much. It was awesome experience. very delicious. We love that food much...

I had one of their favourites chicken wings with curly fries but it doesn't even come close to Nandos.
5
Chicken wings with crudites and ranch dressing was superb.
The ambience from clarck key so beautiful.
Singapore was the best place to transit place for business trip.

Found this by accident during an afternoon visit to Clarke Quay. Was impressed with their advert for the $10 lunch. Decided to try. Managed to sit overlooking side of river. Girls very pleasant and ordered the NZ Steak plus Tiger Beer. Fantastic value and speedy service. Great to sit and relax watching the river activity. Returned more days choosing different menu and each was excellent

I was here with my bestfriend. We were on a birthday weekend getaway XD And this is the first time I tried Hooters. One of my friend keeps saying how he loves the Place, so I thought, I could gave it a try.So..., let's begin :)The Location: It's located in Clarke Quay area. In the River Valley Road. Where a lot of any other bars and restaurants around. So, not that difficult to locate it. And since it's located in one of the corners there, so you can spot the OWL easily!But probably, due to a lot of any other bars and cafe and restaurant nearby, then Hooters wasn't that crowded at that time. Well, it was actually Saturday night, tho.The Atmosphere: A regular modern cafe/bar type. But, one god thing is the Sports channel TV! haha.. My Friend and I love sports, and especially football, so it was fun enjoying the meals while watching football match. The music inside was also good. Not too loud, so we can still enjoy the night and converse with each other.And there were only 2 waitresses tho.. But, because it wasn't that packed, so It was enough.The staffs were so friendly! They were so patient explaining the menus for us. Definitely a big PLUS! :)The Food: The taste was good. Not spectacular, but you can enjoy it. :)The Portion: For big eater! If you are a light eater, I bet you won't be able to finish a plate! Haha.. Really! The portion was biiggg... Even the iced tea glass was BIG! But considering it's an American restaurant, I won't be surprised. Because, in my experience, I usually get this kinda big size portion when dining in American restaurant/cafe/bar.The Price: Well. I have to say, it's pricey. Like really. So, if you wanna try this place out, please make sure you prepare enough money. I had their buffalo wings, nachos, a bottle of Soju, and 2 regular iced tea.. and costed me almost SGD$90. But, if it wasn't too much for you, well probably this is your suitable place :)Will I recommend the place? Yes. Despite of the price (well, pricey for me But people have their own standard, right :) ), the place was quite cozy to spend a night out with your friends. Oh and watching the sport while eating big bucket ones! :

Hooters is what it is with good value food and right on the waterfront. We indulged in the $10 lunch menu and were all happy with what we got. Drinks were reasonably priced and service was good. The girls were cheerful and willing to pose for photos with our group.All in all a pleasent lunch experience, would recommend
4
Have been to Hooters a few times in the past, but just recently is seemed to have lost a bit of its Hoot.The waitress staff used to be a lot more fun and friendly, we had a meal on this visit service was fine and the food was good for the price considering it was Hooters after all.We where there early evening so the place wasn't that busy, so possibly that's why things weren't as fun as previous visits. Hooters is worth a look if you've never been before but other than that it's the same as any other franchise restaurant in my opinion
5
hi y'all r you board in Singapore and want to try something new? well give a try for this hooters at clark quay, it its a good place to eat and it is a reasonable price. if y palling to go boozing make sure u don't don't do it at 11:00 PM in Singapore local time, because according to the new Singapore gov. law, you r not permitted to buy any alcohol drinks in Singapore because the Singapore government want to lessen the hangover problems,PLEASE do come earlier because on weekdays - sat, sun and fri or hol days, this place is crowded and must wait for a long time for getting seat
2
Service was a bit slow. Food was absolutely horrible, had nachos, buffalo chicken sandwich. My wife had mixed grill. The sauce on the chicken sandwich tasted like sour tomato sauce, no buffalo sauce at all. The chicken thigh on the mix grill seems to have been nuked to death. Very bad. I've been to Hooters all over the world, and this is the worst one I ever been to
3
It's a great location and good service but the meal choices were disappointing. What you would expect as regular menu choices for this type of bar were missing and some of what we did have was average.
4
Grabbed a bit of a feed and some beers...it was pretty good. Gave the Wings and Alaskan Crab a go....very nice. Staff were pleasant. (My GF hooters were bigger though!) Very good experience
3
Food was ok. Atmosphere was ok. Funny thing is, the standard wasn‚Äôt what was expected. Anyway, perhaps hooters can look into giving birthday babies a small gift or discount. üòÅ
4
I've visited a few Hooters restaurants in different countries and this was ok.There seemed to be a shortage of staff but there again, a shortage of customers too - resulting in little or no atmosphere in the place.Our waitress didn't speak too much English ... or was shy.The food was nice, typical Hooters fayre.I didn't realise we could sit outside by the river until it was too late, it might have been better than the insipid atmosphere inside
1
Singapore is an expensive city, we all know that. At Hooters, you will be served very average food for the maximum price. Service took very long, only 3 girls ro serve the terrace and barfood took forever. Perhaps folding napkins with your back to your customers at 6 pm with a shortage of staff isn't the smartest move. The food wasn't tasty, we ordered a bbq platter to share with our drinks. The chicken and shrimp were all covered in the same sauce, which didn't suit the shimp at all. Three sticks of tired celery and carrot could be dipped into a blue cheese sauce poured straight from a bottle, served on a paper sheet covering a plastic dinnerplate, all for the extraordinary price of 36 $, ex service charge and tax..... Needless to say we went elsewhere for a proper dinner.
2
I have been in some hooters and this must be the worst, 2-3 waitress girls 1 chinese i think with no hooters at all ;-) the one who served me did her best i think, she was nice , but 3-4 guys also serve ? is not hooters like an institute,the tacos i ordered was stone cold but the beer was ok
3
I was here with my fam last friday (29 Dec 2017) and was reminded why I stopped coming to this place. The food was terrible and arrived luke-warm. The service was even more horrible. We were 4 of us when we first entered and had informed the staff that we were expecting 4 more friends to join us. The staff refused to give us a table for 8 and insisted that we take a table for 4 first. We ordered a round of drinks and some finger food. The finger food that came after a long wait was luke warm as if left outside and forgotten for a while. When our friends arrived and we asked for a bigger table or to join 2 tables, the staff on the ground refused and insisted that we moved inside the restaurant if we wanted to join tables. I could not understand what problem did the staff have when there were empty unreserved tables of 4 around us. When we asked for an explanation the staff rudely replied, "just cannot". We gulped down our drinks and left making a note never to visit this place again. There are plenty of other bars and restaurants with better food & drinks and friendlier staff along the riverside at CQ that you can go to. Avoid this place
5
We came back to hooters 3 times during our visit to Singapore. Our hotel was close to Clarkes quay so we ended up at the quay most days. Had a great meal here on the first day at a very reasonable price so came back again and agai
3
The place is definitely not spoilt by expensive prices - if you want a quick and relatively cheap lunch, you will surely get it there. They have a few sets for 10SGD ex. fish and chips + ice cream and drink.The service is ok, quite slow though
4
My daughter and I visited Hooters for an early dinner after a long day at Sentosa. We were seated quickly at a table overlooking the river.I ordered the fish and chips and a coke zero and my daughter ordered a hamburger and an orange juice. We also had a voucher for complementary teriyaki chicken wings which we had found in a tourist brochure.The servings were HUGE and had I known how big they were going to be, I would have just shared the hamburger with my daughter instead of ordering the fish and chips as well.The fish and chips was really nice and came with a small salad and tartar sauce. The 'chips' were crunchy curly fries and were yummy, and the fish was lightly battered and nice and moist. My daughter said that she enjoyed her hamburger which, again, came with curly fries. The chicken wings was the outstanding dish. The wings were large and plump and the teriyaki sauce sticky and tasty. It was, again, a large serving.Service was efficient and friendly and our total bill came to $60.48, which I consider to be good value
4
This was our first visit to a Hooters restaurant and we were pleased for our visit. Food was nice, had some pasta and wings. Staff was friendly and the place itself was tidy and clean. Would surely come again for a quick meal.
3
a nice pub on the clarke quay. Not a place for kids. The food and drinks were alright but nothing great.
4
Very nice place with decent food and ambience too. Everything went well, although you sometimes have to wait a bit to catch a server's eye. Food was tasty, drinks were good and altogether, a nice place.
4
We came across Hooters by chance while walking along Clarke Quay and decided to try it for lunch and we were not disappointed. The service was excellent and the food was very good. We would definitely recomment this restaurant.
3
it is a big hooters, at Clarke quay, near river, and is the first, famous one. however the girls are keeping busy and cool to customers. no dancing, and unwilling to provide good services. It was not so good.
5
Good food as you know it from the US Hooters restaurants. Sit outside next to Singapore river and enjoy a beer or a drink or a burger and look at the bumboats passing by.
Staff friendly and and helpful.
4
Ordered their honey glazed chicken chop and their original chicken wing. Wash down with root beer float. Very nice.
5
This Hooters was the first in Asia, opening 25 years ago. True to it's form, it's exactly the same experience as any other Hooters around the world, and depending on your perspective that is either a good thing or not. I personally enjoy the relaxed atmosphere and plain old American cuisine. The wings are a must, as is the lager
4
Upon strolling down Clarke quay district I stumbled upon hooters, we had eaten dinner already but just couldn't resist ordering some beer, fried pickles and tacos. The service was very good, quick and efficient. The food was absolutely delicious for a late night feed which is always allowed while on holidays hahahaha.I will definitely be returning here on my next trip in feb!
1
We ordered 6 mug of beers for almost 45 mins and we get nothing at all . I don‚Äôt know how hard it is to pour a draught beer . Gave us ridiculous excuse like changing the barrel . But could you just at least inform us that we might need to wait ? The waitress don‚Äôt seem willing to serve us at all .
4
its really great to have a good food after long day with a beautiful scenery. its quite relaxing witj a good ambience including the scenery and yet its so affordable.
4
We wanted a relatively quiet place so we could continue business discussions over dinner. Hooters was selected for the fun atmosphere and quietness. Food was good and staple, nothing special but all good. Staff were attentive and polite too. So all round good experience.
5
Great location , great food n great service , can sit there for hours and watch the boats go by have a great conversation n a few drinks which continues to be topped up... will def be back
5
We reached clarke quay quite late at 12.30 am and were looking for a nice place to chit chat and have non alcoholics. Finally fpund that hooters was open and sat there for a very long time. They served up good options pretty fast and even did not push out though we were the last ones left. They served with a big smile and saw us off equally happy. Must visit
3
It was our first dinner in Singapore. It was late so you can hardly find a restaurant after 10 pm but in Clarke it's all night long service.Right beside the river with a nice view. Food was not bad, especially the seafood and the soup. Prices are not very high but the service is quite slow
2
Same food that you would expect from Hooters anywhere in the world, but the service was dire.Hardly any staff & that ones that were there didn‚Äôt seem to know what they were doing. Brought our drinks over then took them away, then brought them back again, no idea why.The kitchen staff were ringing the bell several times before meals were being collected for delivery to tables.Wouldn‚Äôt bother going there, it‚Äôs really not the ‚Äúgenuine‚Äù Hooters experienc
4
I don't have to explain why we decided to go to Hooters. To be honest, we were disappointed about the waitress, but man the meal was amazing! Those were the BEST NACHOS I've ever eaten. I'm not Mexican but I live in Barcelona and I've tried a lot, so trust me please. Then the burger was great great. Whatever your choice is, the meat is really really tasteful. I am really looking forward to traveling to another city were there is a Hooter
4
Having previously eaten at a nearby Thai restaurant we decided to try Hooters on our last night in Singapore. Again we choose a table overlooking the Quay which is lovely and were quickly shown the Menu by our Waitress in a tight top and Hot Pants!! Being American cuisine everything is straightforward and plain to understand so no problems there! Food was very good and so was the service, fast and efficient - just the way i like it.Food prices were also very reasonable, our meal costing us just ¬£50 with drinks and dessert. You have a huge choice of restaurants along Clark's quay but for a no hassle fast meal this was was just fine
1
We went with the family there to eat the traditional chicken wings with the famous hooter's sauce, the place was full and they were able to accommodate us outside.The hostess was polite and she introduced us to Sugar, who was our server on August 8, TABLE 148 with the check or trans # 1071287.The service was just OK, the waitress was not rude neither was warm at all, just a robot who delivery the food without genuine care. My wife ordered to share with me chicken wings with the original sauce and our expectation was to eat the same that are served in the US. Our surprise was when Sugar brought us the chicken wings and the breaded is not the hooters type and with too high flavour of butter. My Wife shared with Sugar that the flavour was not the same at all than the US and even we only ate one and after our comment, Sugar mentioned to us that the similar sauce as the original in the US were others. She never offered to us to changed for the other ones, even the asset was full; nevertheless we ordered the other ones and paid for everything. service was far from expected.Your chicken quesadilla was done more as chicken fajitas with cheese, onion and green / red pepper. This is not a chicken quesadilla at all. After living in the US and M√©xico, even eating a simple chicken quesadilla in other parts os the world, I am sorry to say that you really need to prepare this one with grilled chicken and cheese. You can put pic√≥ de gallo and guacamole on the side but you should not add green, red pepper and onion on this one! Especially when we mentioned to the waitress Sugar that was for our youngest Daughter.Will I come back to you in Singapore? To be honest no for food, nice ambiance but service and quality of the food really far
4
We went at night when Clarke Quay was in full flow. Great location by the river, this is a fun place with an extensive drinks menu. Include it as a stop on a pub crawl but try not to let your other half catch you admiring the waitresses with the spray-on orange shorts!
4
Hooters tend to be pretty standard wherever they are and this was no different. Good ribs, good beer, great location overlooking Clarke Quay sat in the fresh air :)
5
Place to sit and enjoy at riverside with excellent service, drinks and snacks. Must go if you staying somewhere in clarke quay at Singapore.
4
Nothing major. Good cheap lunch deals. On the river so location is great. Food is decent quality and they have drink specials.
4
We spend some time relaxing for lunch here & found this place to be of great value. Excellent meal portions as platter with Beer pint included.

Nestled in a great location by the Singapore river in the bustling Clarke Quay area and fairly large indoor as well as outdoor seating options, this restaurant certainly has the potential to be one of the greatest Hooters restaurants in the World but pretty badly let down by the mediocre quality and taste of "Hooters Food" they serve and how distatefully the team does it as well. The family Hooters wings are edible but not like the original ones that you cannot wait to sink your teeth in, the animal they come from is most likely tasteless and overblown farm chickens cooked unevenly and the original sauce is the only thing that saves it in the end. And what is Hooters (of Chicken) wings without the celery sticks and the blue cheese sauce.? You get those only if you order them additionally and separately and even then the celery stick are soggy and not fresh and thr blue cheese is almost totally missing in the sauce. The great Hooters girl is replaced with an extremely poor Asian Cousin selection without and Hooters and flabby Centers and really living up to the motto Tacky and Unrefined but missing the whole delightful element. A few of the ladies at least try to do a job with a smile resembling Hooters style but most can't be bothered to be nice or even some put on the Hooters Uniform but walk around like dungeon Guards covered in black from TOP to toe. Apart from the wings the rest of the menu is not exciting but OK but again lacks th extra zest that they seem to have in the American restaurants of the chain. And th irony of it all is that Hooters is still probably the best chicken wings in Singapore (or at least among the places serving wings I could find, and I searched quite a bit). So I will go back there some time again to have my beloved chicken wings but once again probably not enjoy it as much as I was used to and hope to

Four of us had dined well and decided to have a look at Clarke Quay. But what we saw were hordes of people, mostly young, enjoying all the delights the area has to offer.We managed to snare a table by the river at Hooters and watched Singapore at play. Very noisy.This is really a young person's domain but it was good to experience it (once!)
4
We stopped here for dinner on our short stop over. The Staff were lovely & friendly. We sat on the water front, spectacular views watching the boats go by, while my husband watched other views lol The food & drink was great & the prices were not to bad as they had some great deals on the beer

Visited Hooters Clarke Quay for a friend's birthday party. He absolutely adores Hooters and it was his party so it was a no brainer that he dragged everyone there. Location wise, you can go wrong being at Clarke Quay. It's a happening place with lots of tourists but there's also stiff competition given the number of restaurants and bars in the area. For those who have not been, it's definitely worth checking out. Restaurant wise, the place is decently decorated and brightly lighted so it doesn't give the seedy feel. As you would expect, the girls working at Hooters dress the same all around the world. Once you get past that fact, it's actually not that bad a place. I noticed a couple of guys bringing their "dates" to this place. To be fair, I wouldn't know if these are their girlfriends or girls who friend-zoned them. There was a table with ladies only as well as a table with an elderly couple.Food wise, there was a fairly good variety although most of the options were on the unhealthier side of the scale. Had a medium spicy wing and it was alright. The nachos, salad, triple platter were all pretty good. Drinks are a little on the pricier side but still affordable. Service wasn't great but wasn't bad either. The place wasn't packed for a Friday night which tells me it isn't a popular choice for dinner. Overall, Hooters is a decent place for dinner and drinks but it's a place where some fancy and others do not. Unfortunately, I'm probably leaning towards the latter camp as I think there are better places to have a meal and catch up with friends. Having said this, I have a sneaky feeling that we'd be back again to celebrate that friend's birthday next year! Hahah
2
The waiters were really friendly but we had way higher expectations! The buffalo platters which included shrimps, wings and chicken strips was NOT crispy at all, and all the rest of the food we ordered was not really good. The offer on the beers was good.
2
The plus side to this Hooters is that it is on the river. You get some nice views if you are able to get a riverside table. Another plus is that it is conveniently located in Clarke Quay, so you have other options if you are not satified. Downfalls are that it's not worth the money to sit there (S$32 for two pints of Singapore Blonde). Cheaper deals if you walk around to other restaurants. Also, it's time for management to clean/wash those disgusting overhead domes that cover the outside patio
4
Called at Hooters after a trip down the river for a refreshing cold beer A1
Then decided to cheat out the hot wings for a snack it's best to try a full selection
Also a great view!
2
Service was excellent. Food just okay. I thought pricing was expensive for what you got. I was expecting more atmosphere but there wasn't any.
4
We had a great lunch and dinner here. The best time to eat there is.dinner because the breathtaking views. and for the food I guess its just fine because we orderd just a simple menu the fries and chicken. its affordable,and fine.
4
Probably best value set lunch menu. Meal soft drink and ice cream for around $10 amazingly good value for Clarke Quay. Food was plentiful and tasty. Nice outdoor undercover area next to the river. Pleasant cheap alternative. Regular menu quit pricey.
4
This American chain doesn't seem to fit in Singapore in my humble opinion.The food is undoubtedly American - with fried this and that. The food maybe good for expat Americans - and also kids - but of course the brand Hooters is based on a sex-sell model. The waitresses are very cute mind you.Having said that, I do enjoy eating at Hooters - because of their spectacular wings.I could eat them all day. Combined with a pint of Tiger beer, its a wonderful and relatively low cost lunch. The location on Clark Quay is beautiful and a great spot to watch the world go b
2
We were checking out the riverside just above the bay and I happened to see Hooters and we decided to go in for lunch. The setup here was similar to any other Hooters with seating for 100 plus. We were greeted right away and was told I could set wherever I liked. After choosing a table menus were brought over. I decided on the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, my friend decided on 10 chicken wings with 5 of them being medium heat and the other 5 being 911 (the hottest they have).The fries arrived first, they were just okay. My Buffalo Chicken Sandwich arrived next, the chicken itself was pretty good but it shouldn't be called Buffalo, there is no Buffalo sauce or an anything else on it for that matter. It comes with Baked Beans that tasted like they were right out of a can.My friends wings arrived next, they looked good so I tried one of the regular ones while she tried one of the 911's. I thought it was alright but that's about it, I asked my friend how she liked the wings and she said they were okay and that the 911's were not very spicy.The service was good and the place was clean but the food was subpar
3
Visited here yesterday for a late lunch. We had missed the lunch time specials by 10 minutes even though the waitress handed us the lunch time offer menu so instead we decided to opt for a couple of starters with fries to share. Big portions and great taste
2
We visited for a quick snack however were very disappointed with food the steak in the sandwich was tough and chewy and didn't have much flavour. I didn't eat it. This place is expensive, it cost us $80 for 2 steak sandwiches, glass of wine and a cider. I felt ripped off. I wished we had looked for a different option and not rushed in there. There really aren't any healthier choices either. Can't recommend this place
2
What a disappointing place to visit. Intended to stay for drinks and dinner but the service was so poor and the drinks so expensive we decided to leave after one drink. The staff gave you the impression that we were an annoyance to their day. Everyone felt uncomfortable so we showed our distaste with our feet and tried another venue. I am surprised at the prices and service considering the amount of competition that is around Clarke Quay. Not a good advertisement for Hooters. Will not be going back any day
3
Honestly, not at 'hoot' as I thought it'd be. The 'scantily' dressed Hooters waitresses weren't really much to 'hoot' about. Mostly (perhaps all) Pinoy servers, some with obvious lechon belly, perhaps showing how good their lives are in Singapore.Hardly any interaction with customers other than taking orders and presenting the bill.Quite boring.PLUS, food is expensive. Skip this. Go somewhere else more exotic. Better still, leave this country. Go to Thailand
1
Ordered a few cocktails and there seemed to be no alcohol in mine? Very disappointed very poor service, filthy ceiling, toilets flooding, $35 for two cocktails including compulsory service charge and taxes,
3
Hooters is affordable all time favorite food. I had the New Zealand Sirloin with salad and curly fries, tall glass of soda and a cup of purple yam ice cream for only S$10.00!!
4
we were a gang of 4 - all from different parts of the world - had real good time - catching up over beer and snacks - nice ambiance - river side - open air - good service.
4
Visited few Hooters outlet.. Singapore Hooters ? good location, delicious food (a bit expensive). staffs service average, those in white Hooters shirt - good service and smile always.. those in black Hooters shirt, not friendly and slow in response..
Overall, Phuket Hooters still the best..
4
This was great .... jet-lagged, just arrived, not that hungry. A pitcher of beer, and picked at different starters for an hour - excellent!
2
We have been to a few Hooters bars around the world and this one is not one of the best. I am no spring chicken myself but 2 old dears were behind the bar. This is noticeable in Singapore that older people are employed which is great. However I don't think this would happen at a Hooters in say Miami. To be fair the service was good and various deals on drinks are offered ie buy two get a third free etc. All in all not quite up to the standard I would have expected
2
Well what a disappointment eating at Hooters turned out to be. Poor quality food and poor service. Waiters looked uninterested and disengaging. Having used Hooters in other countries and had a great experience this was quite a surprise and this branch is by far the worse
4
Visited early April for dinner. Great location - right on the river. Great cocktails to start but they were not cheap. Usual food - burgers and a seafood and chicken dish. Both really well cooked and very tasty so no complaints about the food or drink.Staff are always good at Hooters (and they do look pretty good) and service was of a high standard.Overall pretty good as are other Hooters I have to been to around the world. Off to Phuket soon so will go to the Hooters in Patong (again)
4
We had coffee here during the day and went again in the evening. My son has a peanut allergy so we were able to try another variety of food safe for him. Great burgers and jugs of cold beer on ice. The staff were excellent and very attentive
1
Went here last Wednesday night as we have never been to a Hooters and was looking forward to it.I ordered the Philly Beef Roll without green peppers.When i got it the waitress even said here is your roll without peppers and it had peppers.The beef had no flavour and the roll was wet so it fell apart straight away. The Buffalo Chicken Sandwich was tough and no spice.The 2 burgers and 2 drinks cost S$67.30.I will never recommend this place
3
Located in the expensive side of town,Clarks Quay-location is good.Food is greasy- mainly American.Good for some beers .I had never been to a Hooters elsewhere,so just went to tick it off my bucket list
4
This a great taste of the US in Singapore. Great wings and beer!
Girls are really friendly and the service is great!
Great deal at lunch with a wide variety of options for $10. Includes a drink, a main and ice cream for dessert.
3
Grabbed some wings and missed the boneless wings which they seems to only have in the U.S. Food was average and not so tasty. Service was also ok more or less.
4
If you love fries and wings as well as drinks by the river than you definately should pay a visit to Hooters!
3
Service needs improvement, the gals around there are nicely dressed to attract the customers, single or couple or family or business.. This place is worth for drinks and dinner
4
Hoo hoo hoo ! Spend a nice evening in Hooters with friends or family by the Riverside of Singapore river , food is typical American taste and portion. Nice bar scene with nice music.

After a long day out and about in Singapore, there was a great deal of choice when looking for a place to eat. However it was Hooters that attracted our attention and proved a great place to relax, enjoy a drink and something to eat.We were given a warm welcome and promptly shown to a table mid restaurant. Shortly after ordering our drinks our hostess returned and invited us to move to a table that had been vacated waterside.Service was prompt and food very good.No frills, no fuss - this was a great place to sit and watch the world go by on a warm evening together with a "Rock Star Monitor".Hooters Singapore opens from 11:00am and closes at 12:00pm or 2:00am depending on the day
5
What better than to sit down by the Singapore River and tuck in to the lunch time special of a main course, desert and soft drink for ten dollars. You can even add a Tiger beer for another five dollars. Good service, good food, not crowded and good people watching
3
We went here last Saturday night. We only ordered 3 beers and 1 nachos. Food tastes good and big portion. Price is expensive as it is in the famous bars area and nice river view, Clarke Quay. Unfortunately, we waited for 10 minutes to have the waiter taking our order and another 20 minutes to get the beers and food
3
It's been about 2 years since I've been to Hooters. They've update their menu and there is a lot more options and offers. The service was good and the views were great to. You do have the option of smoking or non smoking seating. My husband ordered the chilli and chips and said it was ok. He didn't finish it
4
we just wanted something to eat at an affordable price. Hooter's is all the same, everywhere in the world. Wings are good. If you go there for the girls (hooter's girls), go somewhere else.
3
Quick lunch of 911 wings, deep fried pickles and beer. All were okay. I like the fact the pitcher of beer was placed into ice to ensure it remains cold. I have eaten at NYC and other Hooters before and Singapore iteration is on par.
5
Great restaurant! Excellent food, excellent service, great view! Especially liked the ala olio with tiger prawns!
3
We got one free lunch there with iVenture Card. It was plenty of food per person ‚Äì steaks, French fries, soft drink, ice-cream. Food is tasty so it‚Äôs worth the try.
3
Clarke Quay outlets are supremely expensive. Please chose with care. Since we wanted a couple of quick drinks, we stepped in Hooters.
Average stuff with average service. And I am sure the management would be finding it difficult to get servers of the global specificationüòâ

Not quiet up to the same standard as the US outlets but then the girls aren't so big either! Always nice to do some sightseeing at Hooters!

We go to Hooter's or other such places when we are in the mood for bar food. A bucket of beer, chicken wings, and maybe a burger. If you occasionally enjoy the same, then skip Hooters Singapore.While nicely remodelled, and the Archipelago on tap is a needed improvement, that is where the good news ends. The food quality has become extremely poor, as has the food preparation. Chicken wings were literally covered in grease and not cooked at the right temperature. Terrible. The burger patty has been changed, and the flavour was unappealing. The bun was tough and bland. All 8 people at our table were disappointed with their meal (so it wasn't just one dish).Service quality has also dropped since the remodel. I have been going to this Hooters for over a decade, but all the recent changes simply mean that I won't be back. Very expensive, poor food, and below average service.

a well loved, cheerful chain with comfort food at its best. it's located nicely in Clarke Quay, which was short distance from our hotel. Prices are on average with restaurants in the area. Good & fast service. do recommend to go in the evening when it is not too hot to be outside, although they do have AC are
3
Clarke Quay is a lovely, however do your homework on where you are going to eat and drink. Hooters is fine, they focus on cold drinks and quick service. Reasonable prices for beer and fast food. Prices are reasonable for Singapore prices. A good place to stop cool down and make plans for the rest of your day. The waiters were friendly and ensured we has cold glasses and drinks
3
The location in Clarke quay is pleasant, as it is a rather busy area in the evenings. This restaurant is offering a good selection of dishes, pasta, meats etc but do not expect anything extraordinary.The beer was good, but honestly the general atmosphere is a bit pathetic with 2 young ladies dancing with a hoola hop and 4 customers watching...Not a great experience
4
Gerous serving. Food is excellent. Reasonable price. Good entertainment. Friendly staff. Nice place to unwind.
3
Average place to be honest also tried the one in Thailand and it was just the same
Boring
Overpriced food and drinks
Better places to eat around the quay
2
This place was a typical run of the mill franchise but without the spark, the staff just went through the motions.
The food was ok, the location is superb, the staff need to work on nor being so robotic.
4
Meals were delicious and well priced, atmosphere was vibrant and the service was great. A gods spot to watch the river boats go by.
4
Delicious food, wide variety of international beers. There's other good choices around, but definitely good for a quick dinner
4
Our first night in Singapore and we tried Hooters as nothing else much took our fancy. I found my meal very filling and tasty. The skyline view was lovely in the night and the service was great.
4
It was really to have a dinner there and enjoy the food. The service was really good and the best was the atmosphere with the music and enjoying by the river side.
3
It's located an a nice place at Clarke Quay. The food is not something special buit is acceptable and in good price
3
This is just a typical Hooters store, the same you will find anywhere in the world . There was nothing outstanding, but nothing to complain about either. The food was standard, the setting pleasant being right on the quay, and the service was reasonable, although the staff were very friendly.
5
Ice cold cider and spicy hooters wings by the river. Best starting spot for a night on Clarke Quay. Have been coming here for years, the service is excellent and all of the girls are very friendly without being too friendly (if you know what I mean)
4
impressive lunch deals for 4 course less than 15 dollars nett.huge variety got to try it.for a place on the singapore river its really worth the visit all 7 days a week can get a different item everyday.
4
Very good food, decent drinks selection and nice location next to the water, food was awesome as are all Hooters restaurants. Overall well worth a visit.
4
Nice place for couple of beers, food is ok. For Indians not much food varsity. Seafood is expensive and not cooked as required for indians ,mostly tastes raw.
We had ordered oysters and serlion streak.
Chicken wings were good.
3
Plenty of beers from all over the world. Standard hooters menu but who doesn't like a serving of wings and cheesy curly fries.
Sat inside and it was pretty empty. Outside was busier.
For the amount of guests the service was a little lacking.
4
We came here for a nice meal and good view of the river and ended up having a good time. Service staff is friendly and attentive.
5
nice place
great location
friendly staff
amazing food (NZ steak wow)
love the experince
recomended strongly
wow singapore
4
we always enjoy the food at Hooters the wings with the hot sauce and the fried pickles are always tasty. its great sitting by the river having a cold beer and food.
4
You think you know what to expect from one of these restaurants but you might be delightfully surprised. I went there with my wife and sister (oh yes) for a S$10 lunch time feed (off the special menu). I opted for the extra hugely spicy buffalo wings and the S$5 optional extra Tiger beer. So, all up - cheap, spicy, FAST service, friendly and not at all tacky. I would seriously recommend this place (and the bar directly across the river from it - 2-for-1 drinks all day). Go there now. Enjoy
4
Last night I wanted to watch Arsenal game and after terrible experience in 1st game bar next door I checked in to hooters. They switched the channel to show Arsenal game. Staff was courteous and suggested to try Akashi which I loved.One point less because they don't provide wifi.Throughly enjoyed service and ambiance .Keep the good work up.Definitely visiting again.
3
I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ve been to North American Hooters and Hooters in Asia and this was by far our lest favorite. The area seemed very nice so we decided why not. We usually get great servers and are interested in talking and especially as they work for tips. Here the service charged is already in the bill so they could care less. The food was very bland and the inside environment was just off. We quickly ate and looked to have a decent time just walking around. I wish we would have just walked away
5
You can choose to sit either in the air conditioned restaurant, or in the open air by the side of the river and watch the boats and tourists pass by.
Wide selection of American type snacks and meals with excellent service
2
Hooters in general has lots its allure in the US, and this Singapore brand doesnt do it any favors. Food was OK, but missing something although I couldnt pin it down. The place is a little tired.
3
One evening we ate burgers at Hooters, located along Clark Quae. It was nice to sit near the water. The burgers were pretty ordinary.
1
Bad meal serving is good but not like american hooters we didnt like the food all was too oily i dont recommend it think again
4
Charming, friendly staff, good basic food menu, beer by the jug, located right on the river, this is a pleasant place to come with friends.
3
not bad for a bit of a light hearted laugh .waitress staff were very pleasant .The prices are not too bad for western style food and the beers were super cold . A service charge does apply .the location is spot on and all in all we had no regrets on making it a place to visit mid afternoon when only very few other people were at the restaurant
1
Adding to the numerous other bad reviews. This place is run by a cheap management culture that treats customers with contempt. Wine servings that resemble a thimble, under cooked meat when asked for well done and disinterest in listening to feedback. Hooters brand managers would be well served in removing this franchisee from their network
1
I saw that Hooters was closed for renovations last month and was to reopen on the 16th or so of June. So I made the long hot and humid walk from my residence to Clark Quay for dinner Sunday June 19th. It was open and I sat down -service seemed good as the black shirted manager bounced over, but told me it was a private event and that was it- no sign to announce this and I complained and said I was never coming back after it was rudely closed to me and I will tell ALL my buddies about this lousy service
3
Never went inside for dinner or anything, but since it was happy hour anyway we had landed on the terrace here and sat for a pitcher of Tiger beer and some chicken wings. Kind of touristy crowd, but that is inherent to Clark's Quay and a place like Hooters I guess and after all, we were not locals either. Nice view on the river, nice place to drink a refreshing beer on a tropical afternoon in Singapore, but still far from the nicest
4
Back in 2001 or so I had a chance to visit this location. 14 years later and I was back! It seems to have changed from what I remember it being but it still retains it's charms of being a Hooters in Asia.The Hooters itself still resembles the standard Hooters setup and the ladies still wear the orange booty shorts and tight white T-shirts. The menu items are essentially identical to every other Hooters around the world.It was late afternoon and this batch of girls was seemingly nearing the end of their shift. Regardless, they were still attentive and friendly enough. It was not long before our drinks were served and just a wee bit more and we were snacking on cheese fries and hot wings.The Hooters is a bit pricey, particularly when you factor in the cost of alcohol which is very expensive in Singapore. Towards the end of our stay it was starting to trend towards evening and the place was beginning to fill up, especially the outdoor seating for Hooters which was not present during my last visit.The Hooters does have a gift shop if you need to get those souvenirs for your non-traveling friends
5
Hooters is located right at the Singapore Riverside and offers great food (with even vegetarian versions of non-vegetarian dishes - if requested for). The staff is very hospitable and helpful.
5
Found this on return from a day trip. Hot and tired we walked down to Clarke Quay and found hooters. Sipping Tiger beer by the river and not a care in the world.
4
My husbands first experience. All the trimmings of a normal Hooters. In Singapore eating out in Clarke Quay is so expensive and this is a good priced place.
4
Great location on Clarke Quay - the service was good and food was lovely. I had a prawn dish and it was cooked perfectly.
4
Hooters is a great place to unwind in the evenings, the food is pretty great and the selection of drinks is quite awesome. One of the go to places in clarke quay
4
Enjoyed a meal at hooters whilst in Clarke Quay, nice to get the occasional western meal, extensive menu with huge variety of food options, including decent drinks menu too.Very pricey for what it is, but I guess it's prices are on par with most of the dining options in CQ.Friendly attentive staff, minus the hoOters
4
Were not used to spending $130 on Hooters for two but hey this is Singapore right. Ordered 20 wings which were huge and the wife and I could only eat 13 between us. Drinks with 2 margaritas and a sling and beer. Anyways it was nice on the river and a decent dinner
4
While we were at Clark Quay popped in for a well earned coffee which I have to say was very good and later on came back for lunch calamari on the menu like that and some very nice ice cream cheap and cheerful but very good will be back next timeFrank and Rosemary Devon U

Went there for weekday lunch as we were in the vicinity. Remembered there's a good lunch promo. Many selections of set lunch from pasta, sandwich, hooters famous wings to burgers & steak for only $10++ with drink & scoop of ice cream dessert. We had the steak. It came with curly fries and salad. I love curly fries. Just because they are curly. It was served hot & crisp. Delicious. Good portion size for a set lunch. Enjoyed the taste of the meal too. Nice brown sauce on the steak. The steak looked small but it was a filling meal. The glass of soft drink was huge American sized. And good size scoop of chocolate ice cream. If you want soup of the day & tea/coffee, just had $2.50++ it's really reasonable. Service was ok but we noticed baby cockroaches climbing on the wooden panel walls. This restaurant has been around for a long while, I guess they need to thoroughly check the wooden panels. General areas are clean though, so are the toilets. Critters can hide well in the wooden panels... Will I be back? Yes if I'm in the area, lunch set is good value.
4
Wonderful atmostphere, excellent view of the water,breezy, perfectly cooked chicken strips, great location to hang out on a Friday night with your significant other and relax after a long work week.Apple crumble was prepared and warmed up just right with the vanila ice cream.The only disappointment was the fried ice cream which was $4.50 for a small circular pillow of fried item filled with ice cream. Not worth it. It should be taken off the meal of replaced with churrios..etc.Rest of meal was reasonable for a restaurant at Clarke Quay
1
Thumbs down, I'm afraid. Burger was definitely not what I was expecting (seemed low quality at a premium price). They charged me for ice tea refills (you've gotta be kidding me!!!). Keep away. Don't go!
5
Decent food but a bit expensive. Good Music.
Beautiful view and nice breeze as it's right next to the river
3
For a corona beer SG$17 plus change ??? Just because its simply served by a skimpily clad sexy looking girls ??? Very high even by Singapore standards.
3
Pretty average, nothing outstanding and trading on the brand. Over priced but not quit as bad as other in Clark Quay. American fare which is not really top end dinning like the prices tend to indicate.
4
In the spread of a few years as I visited Singapore, Hooters has become a ritual to dine here. However this time I was with my siblings and my folks so I hope they had fun with the view too.
3
Having done hooters in New York and a few other places in the states I was intrigued to see how it was in Singapore. From my own personal view, Asian women don't have the same get up and go as western women who work for Hooters. There was no atmosphere at all and next to no customers considering it was the weekend, never heard or seen in any other H establishment I've previously visited, very disappointed
4
If you are a tourist and strolling around Clark Quay, and not sure what asian food to eat... Get in here you will be ok.food is just Ok... I dont dink alcohol sory of drink so cant comment on that but I had a quick lunch before getting on a river cruise which is just 20 steps away from its door I was satisfied
3
Having tried Hooters in LA and Vegas, I decided for Hooters as a safe bet on my first evening in Singapore for dinner after a heavy seafood lunch. Location is great, I was given a nice table right along the river too. But the wings were not as good as my expectation. They were a little dry, not juicy and with little flesh. Staff attitude was decent, but service a little slow. Look for other interesting options around Clarke Quay, unless you are dying to have Chicken Wings along riverside :-
4
First time eating at Hooters. Tried one of their $10 lunch deals. Didn't expect much given Singapore is pricey. Pleasantly surprised by the size and tastiness of the meal. Chicken wings were superb washed down with an oversized glass of soft drink. The ice cream was tasteless but included with the meal. There are quite a few other $10 choice
3
We dined in Hooters on 6 occassions over a 5 week period, but found that there were inconsistencies. The food is mostly good and the lunch special is great value at $10 before taxes for which you get a mains, ice cream and a large soft drink. There is lots of variety to choose from.The location is good and it is lovely to sit outside next to the river. So why only an average review - the staff and service. What we found is that if the staff who serve you are wearing the orange shorts and white t shirts you will have good service from friendly staff BUT if you are served by one of the managers / owners you will have a rude and slow service. We were served cold food by the manager as she wouldn't collect the food from the kitchen. We could see our food and the cook was ringing the bell for over 8 minutes before the manager could be bothered to collect it and serve us. She preferred to chat with another manager. There was no apology or acknowledgement that the service was poor. My advice would be look which staff are on duty first and if it's only managers don't go in
5
We stopped here for lunch while visiting Singapore, and we're really happy with the food selections. We would definitely go back again.
4
We really had a good time, enjoying the dishes and the location and German Beer which is my favorite liquid food. Go for the Chicken Wings, yummy.
4
The food is delicious and quite big portion. We ordered tiger prawn spaghetti and grilled chicken. Love the taste of the mild spicy spaghetti and creamy smashed potato. Special christmas dance performed by their sexy hooters during our dine in.
4
Great place to hang out with friends . Amazing ambience ;) cute girls and cold beer !! They have an option of dining by the river side or in the A/C restaurant.
3
Big in the 80's and 90's and they've never really moved on from there. Sure, nice chicken wings etc but it's all just really quite boring.
3
This is my first time to visit this restaurant. We came from Indonesia. We didn't know how the service supposed to be ? For us it just waitress wearing tanktop concept restaurant.For the food itself, chicken wing and beer combo is what they are famous for.It's a new experience for us
2
Having enjoyed Hooters in the USA I suppose I expected the same quality and good service at this one on Clarkes quay in Singapore. Service was very poor as the staff seemed more concerned with the Xmas decorations they were putting up. We placed our order and part of it was fir two root beers, these came and we complained about the quality and was told iced tea tastes like that a they then realised what they did wrong and brought us two tins of Root Beer which was warm and therefore disgusting, sadly they had none chilled despite the fact that everything else seemed to be chilled and the temp outside was over 30c - It was very hard work trying to get through to the staff as there English was vey poor considering so many people in Singapore speak English 
2
Been to most international Hooters. I had the chili cheese and hot wings. The worst wings not only at Hooters but I have had in a very longtime. Franchisee should be ashamed. Tasted like oil...and looked like soaking in oil for a longtime as per the picture. I am a Hooters fan but Clarke Quay Hooters is just not good
1
I dont understand why Hooters Singapore doesn't train their staff like their US counterparts. Service was almost non existence. Staff looks very annoyed when customers come in. It is not easy to call waitress as most of the time they are out of sight or if they do theg are staring blankly at the something else. Attitude is also not cheerful. Wings took 40 min to appear even though there werent many diners. I felt cheated by the enforced service charges on the bill as I am not satisfied with the service at all. It is a service that worth only $2/3, not $10. Back in the US, i could tip 15-20% as this is the place to lift up my mood. But not in Singapore
3
Given the Hooters legacy, there isn't much unexpected here. Place is divided into two areas, one indoors and another by the river outdoors. The beers are regularly priced. We had tried the chicken wings which were quite nice. Overall, a good place for a nice evening at Clarke. What I liked is that the music aint bonkers which mean people can actually chat and have a good time.
4
Loved the setting on the river enhanced by amazing staff. Delicious oysters and cider made for a relaxing afternoon. The service makes the experience let alone the food. Well worth a return visit !
4
We had lunch at hooters and it was fine. Good friendly service, good food and a free ice cream at the end. Ideal for a quick lunch.
4
Come with friends and got happy hours promo. Better price in good place to see the crowds at clarke quay. Nice place to hangout
3
Visited here for a snack and a cold beer, the view of the quay was amazing and the beer was served in a chilled glass. The food was standard for this type of place, the disappointing thing for me was the lack of enthusiasm from the staff
3
I used to be a big hooters fan when I lived in the US. Ever since then I tried some of their international outlets (Tokyo / Switzerland / Frankfurt) ... and either Hooter's glory days are over, or this location is fading away ... everything was ok, the wings were actually spot on taste wise, but the usual 'cheer' was missing, it felt pricy .. and the overall loaction (Clarke Quay) felt a bit sad .. maybe wrong time of day / season .. the service staff was not at all what I recall from other hooters restaurants .. maybe they just had a slow / relaxed day ...
2
Don't waste your time eating anything except the wings the rest of the food is awful. We had to send our jalape√±o poppers back as they were still frozen.But the wings are great.If you are looking for a boys night out Singapore is not the right place for hooters
2
They do what they can and the place is not bad as such. It has the usual decor: wood paneling on the walls, loud tvs showing sports and waitresses in tights.And they have oysters, chicken wings and beer.BUT somehow it was too busy and confusing this evening, the waitress was not overly at home in the concept and the menus. The oysters were very fresh while the fried stuff came across as a bit 'tired'. All told, while not exactly a bad place it just did not have the touch of an original Hooters
1
First and foremost there is no point writing a review like this pretending that the food or service is going to be out of this world. Nope what you expect from hooters is fun and easy going. So this brings us to hooters singapore, which is anything but the above. Went with a friend for a bite to eat only to be given extremely slow service and a bunch of attitude from one server who decided that it was more important to have condiments on an empty table than to let us have them. ...as she snatched them from my friend. Despite complaining to the manager we still ended up paying full rate and more annoyingly FULL service charge despite there being little to no service to speak off. I'm sorry but when a staff member snatches something from a guest you had better do something more than just say sorry! Clearly though the manager there is not aware of this.Anyways the food was terrible, my Burger was so dry I couldn't finish it whilst the fries were soggy. The chicken wings had no sauce (perhaps because the server had snatched them from us) and were nothing more than average.Lastly and as a footnote to everyone who goes to hooter expecting to find real hooters girls I.e. friendly, flirty and endowed....forget singapore, you won't find it.All in all save your money and eat at a hawker stall or the Vietnamese place next door, hooters is garbage
4
well i would like to smirk on people who says that this place has got no food or such. irf you are thinking of sexy and seductive waitresses in skimpy shorts well this is not the place. some of the waitress do wear shorts and quite sexy.. but not seducing you.. now lets get on with the food..1. fried pickles is incredible. i think its the first time having this. but the taste is so nice and the batter is so smooth.. i would rate this 8/102. chicken strips - 6 pcs of long boneless strips.. with 6 kinds of hotness you can choose. iwill rate this 8/103. pork ribs with salad fries.. sauce is great. ribs are soft. great again i would rate this 8.5/10so if you are looking for good food with a cheerful smiling waitresses the come here.. if you are looking for other things in mind, there are more bars availabl
4
Visited here at 11.30am on a Sunday morning trying to find somewhere to eat to cure my hangover. For $20 I had soup, wings and fries, ice cream, and a beer. Amazing value. Rest of the menu was Hooters usual extensive burgers and chicken fayre. Waitresses were very efficient, smart and gave good service. I would recommend
1
horrible service and the food was even worse. It was inedible. the bathroom had black mold on the ceiling and the walls. I have heard they have painted over that since my visit but I definitely would steer far away from this place.
4
I had dinner here with some friends last week and we quite enjoyed ourselves. We sat by the Quay and had a nice view of the bustling area and some nice food to go along with it.
4
Was in the mood for some good burgers that evening. Tried the volcanic level sauce. Still have my tongue. :) Good service though a tad slow at peak times.
3
the only thing i would like to comment is that if your coming here thinking this is like the US hooters, id say there are much better burger places in Singapore.
3
Came here with a work friend in September, the food was ok, pricing is average. Good service, location is good on the quay.
3
Consumed a grilled chicken sandwich ,chicken wings,curly fries and quesadilla. Although the chicken wings were a bit too tangy, the overall food experience was decent.
1
One of the few Hooters in Asia. This chain seems to have forgotten its reason or selling point. The waitresses were OK but none took the time to talk to us which surely is the point. Food is OK but really is that why anyone goes to Hooters. We went at lunchtime and evening but was quiet both times. Good selection of T shirts.
3
I have been to many Hooters in the USA and Europe and have to say that this has got to be one of the worse franchises I have visited. Food is he average fayre, drinks very expensive and girls, pleasant enough. But not up to Hooters usual standards. Very dissapointing
4
Came here with the family before headed off to the Grand Prix. Our waitress was friendly and efficient and the food was tasty. Just what we needed to set us up for a long evening. Shame they don't have a great merchandise area like other hooters. But over all still a enjoyable meal.
3
They should probably change the name of this bar as there isn't really any hooters there ;) beer was expensive ($40 a jug) but we received a buy 2 get 1 free special (must order at the one time - doesn't accumulate). Hostess constantly changed our glasses over to frozen ones - was appreciated. Wouldn't bother visiting again
5
What a great place right on the river front eatery and such a good value for money and the girls are great
4
oh what lovely chicken wings and beer. Amazing location on the clarke quay and not at all expensive.
4
Not a place for couples, not a place for families, more a place for guys who like to drink beer and eat something fatty. Not a sophisticated place but quite okay for a bunch of guys.
3
I saw a lot of the reviews from Thai people about the fried chickens here so I wanted to try it. But I got kind of disappointed as it didn't taste any special. And they make you order the whole set with 10 pieces of chicken and I was alone by myself, so I couldn't finish it. I just had to take home and gave it to someone
3
Let's be honest: food in hooters is by far not the best one around in Singapore, but if you're heading to this restaurant most probably is not because of the its culinary experience. The food is what you'll normally will get in any other hooters in the world. I headed to this restaurant after being eating at local ones for 3 days & with a small family revolution where they all wanted burgers and american food. Place is what promises, however terrace is very nice (same as all surrounding ones
4
If you go to clarke quay, you will find many cafe and restaurants around river, and this cafe was prominent because the waitress. They have the sexiest waitresses among other cafe. Of course this cafe was have more customer than others. This cafe also open in the afternoon since others open at 4pm. The price was so so, not too expensive and not too cheap, but they have promo during lunch.
5
Go for the wings! I would travel a great distance just for the amazing chicken wings with the 911 sauce, ranch dip and celery. By far the best I've eaten in my life! I've been eating here since 2007 and the quality has remained the same! The view around clarke quay from the restaurant is super too
4
on a quite monday afternoon we went to have some beer and snacks at Hooters in Clarke Quay, very pleasant service and had an enjoyable 2 hours watching the traffic on the singapore river with our beer and snacks( wehich were excellent, fresh and tasty) great place to chil
5
Called in to Hooters for a quick drink. The view over the river was wonderful. We walked around the area until 1.30pm, then returned for a $10 lunch consisting of a steak, and fish and chips. Good serves steak perfect. Girls friendly and well spoken English. We then bought souvenirs and left around 4pm. Lovely afternoon on Clarke Quay
3
I have been to Hooters for more than 5 times. Their set lunch was the only reason patronizing the outlet. Pricing at $10++ was worth a grab. You can have sirloin steak, soft drink and ice-cream as a dessert. Add on of $5++ you will have a mug of beer. Would suggesting to management promoting happy hour during lunch time. Something like 1 for 1. It will attract more guest to dine in. Competitors surrounding is doing great for happy hour. Might think of it
3
Typical American style.
Famous concept restaurant for burgers, hot-wings etc.
Nice and friendly - have visited several times.
You can sit outside directly on the Singapore river front - or inside in air-con.
4
They offer both outside and inside seating. Both have nice views depending on what you're interested in. The prices are pretty decent as far as Singapore goes. The waiters are obviously friendly and cheerful - as you would expect at Hooters.
3
~went with colleagues for desserts
~Fried Ice Cream sauced with chocolate sauce a quick easy 2 bites and it's over!
~the Apple Crumble is a grand homemade American Pie sized lovely sweet dessert, GREAT
~lookup the photos to see what I ate!
4
Nice place to eat. Good American style food. Only shame is that the Asian women are a bit lacking in the place where Hooters is known for. It's a bit expensive, but then that's the whole of Singapore. Overall good experiance.
4
I had heard lot about hooters and this was first hooters I went to. I liked their chicken wings a lot.
However, my friend who had tried their US and Japan's restaurants, did not find this branch to be as good as others.
4
A very good selection of meals, drinks and the staff were fantastic, cheerful and prompt with service. Reasonably priced and situated right on the riverfront.
3
I dropped by the Hooters branch in Clarke Quay, Singapore to compare it with the other Hooters branches I've visited in the US. The place was full, well lighted with the servers in their trademark outfits. Food was typical of any Hooters branch. I guess you have to try it once in your life to say I've visited Hooters but nothing worth going back for unless you want to ogle the servers and pay tourist trap rates. Been there, done that. Nuff said
4
Hooters is a world famous chain of an american sports bar that is famous for it's pork ribs and waitresses dressed in minimal clothing.The buffalo wings are also world famous as is the atmosphere and environment with music, beers and good food.Always a favourite with those wanting buffalo wings and ribs!In the middle of where it all happens on clarke quay by the river...it's packed all week long except at lunch time but otherwise, very popular with tourists especially
4
As we walked past Hooters at Clarke Quay at midday, we noticed a sign advertising lunch for S$10++. Always on the lookout for a bargain we decided to give it a try and were not disappointed.There was a choice of several main courses such as Caesar salad (which we had), fish and chips, burger, etc. Also included was a serve of ice cream (mango) and a soft drink.The Caesar salad was very good and came with slices of chicken and a piece of what appeared to be garlic bread, on the side.Service was efficient and it was nice to rest our feet sitting by the river watching the passing parade
4
I was amazed to find Hooters in Singapore, bearing in mind it being a Muslim country where handholding out of wedlock is banned... This being our first visit to a Hooters, we weren't sure what to expect. The girls were dressed as expected, and the food was good. Real American comfort food. Lies directly on the river bank. They have a smokers section, which otherwise is hard to find in Singapore
2
Fries are poor.
No boneless wings. No BBQ sauce. No ranch dressing.
Instead you get some chicken strips that are barely covered with any kind of sauce.
I thought Hooters would have the same menu universally, but no!
5
Excellent fish was served, very nice view. They offer good deals.Its a must visit place in Singapore Staff is very courteous. Best to be there after sunset so that there is ample time to chill.

Hooters is know for the female scenery, and this one has some beautiful ladies serving. Only one I've been to that has the shrimp prepared like the wings.....a real treat! Nice area along the river to sit outside.
4
Yep, they have a Hooters right in Clarke Quay overlooking the river. We stopped in and sat outside right by river. Had nice lunch, standard Hooters fare. Wait staff wears same
4
Being Canadian, it is very difficult to find good wings. This place has very good wings, with cold beer, and a lovely riverside view. The service is great. They have fans which keep you cool on hot days. Yes, it is a bit pricey, but worth it for the wings. Don't get the carrot sticks and dip
4
An awesome afternoon , good location to other food and beverage outlets. Once to be located next to the harbour. The food was delicious and drinks were very reasonably priced. Unfortunately the "hooters girls" were not what I expected. One of our waitresses was extremely rude and gave us our bill when we were trying to order more food and drinks making us feel like she wanted us to leave however there was another Filipino waitress who was very friendly and had excellent customer service. The restaurant offers both outdoor and indoor seating and also sells souvenirs
2
This was the 3rd time I had visited Hooters Singapore and unfortunately 3rd time luck wasnt apparent.The food is good, it's what you would expect but c'mon we all know why people go to a Hooters.. The staff have no personality and unfortunately do not live up to the playful rep Hooters has.. Disapointing at best
4
Who would believe a Hooters in Singapore at mc artery quay. It was there with great food easy viewing of the skyline, easy access to the river cruise, and COLD beer a specialty of the house. Wait staff was at your side continuously. What a great experienc
5
We stopped here for a snack and it was fine,they did daytime deals which looked great value,the girls wear very short shorts but look great,we were served straight away and both food and drinks came promptly,thie seats we had were right on the river which gave us a great view but you can eat inside if you orefe
4
My second home while I was in college. I was actually surprised to find one in Singapore. I am a big fan of the chicken wings. Service is ok. Its not very fast but not slow either. Located in Clarke Quay, it has a nice view of the river. For a quick snack your familiar with, it is a nice stop. For an unusual souvenir like a shot glass, it will make a unique gift. Other than ....
3
Nice place for a quick snack and a fast bear. Nothing exceptionaly. Fast food with average taste. If you need a fast snack you can go if you search for taste dont do it here.
The same concept as any hooters in the world.
4
Nice location and a good place to sit and 'people watch' with a beer or two. The lovely Waitresses are worth watching too.
4
I had to wait for a while to get a table which means the restaurant was really popular. The food was delicious with reasonable price. My boyfriend really loved the servers! Haha
4
Fantastic environment and atmosphere for casual dining down on Clarke Quay. Good service with the usual smiling faces, rolls of paper towels, cold beer, and happy customers. Always stop by here on my trips to Singapore to get a Hooters hit wing fix.
3
Well, troughout the years quality seems to drop but that seems to be the case everywhere. Food is very expensive and portions been getting smaller so inflation is doing its tricks.
4
It's casual sit down dining so that's how I assess this place: Ambience 5/5 - very nice riverside setting. Always busy in peak hours. I notice many couples enjoying a romantic time. Food 4/5 - selection is good as there is two menus and many options to suite tastes but not those who have special preferences. We ordered the mutton satays which were excellent. The peanut dip was very tasty and had slight spice to it. Chicken wings was good. We asked for no crumbed and well done. And it came as ordered. They forgot to give the fries but it was okay as we were heading to Wings Bar nearby for our dose of spicy wings. Drinks 3/5 - and this is based on cocktail which was nothing exciting. Beers were as expected. I still prefer the cocktails at Wings Bar. Not badly priced but tasty from start to end. So at hooters I will stick to the canned and bottled stuff. Service 4/5 - I rate highly here as the staff create a nice buzz and dress well to meet the hooters standards. Cleanliness 4/5 - fine to me. OVERALL: I will come back again for snacks and even test a meal. It is Hooters after all.
2
First visit to a Hooters and the one in Clarke Quay was below average. Wine served was half a glass and a pint served was no more than a small schooner. Food ok but nothing to rave about, more like cafeteria food. Service was slow and inattentive which was surprising .Give this place a miss ....
2
The location by the riverside is nice, but the food is very ordinary, food and beers were expensive and they were the grottiest toilet facilities we saw in the whole time we were in Singapore. The waitress was nice, but we won't be going back - there are lots of better options along the waterfront
4
Some like the food, some like the waitresses and some do not like the prices.Well, it is Singapore and you have to search for the really cheap places.We were lucky and enjoyed both our meals and the outdoor location next to the river, otherwise we would have called it average. Staff was smiling and friendly.Prices vary a bit depending on your selection,- we enjoyed the seafood menu and found the prices to be fair.We sat outside but saw lots of guests indoor as well. An ok place for a visit or two
2
My first visit to Hooters ever. Even though I just went for some drinks and snacks, I was expecting a bit more. Quality of food is probably not the reason why you will go there anyway. So enjoy the atmosphere, nothing compared to what I have been told in other locations.Since it was evening during the week, I bet it was not as busy as a weekend at night.Location in Clarke Quay is probably the only thing I would highlight
5
Simple wings call 911 and down a bucket of Tiger beer ! The loos the same as it was in 2009 loads of hooter calendar plastered on the walls . Good view , nice staff and cheap to boot !
4
Enjoyed the 99 cent chicken wings smothered in atomic chilli sauce which you get when you buy a pitcher of lager. The view wasn't bad either, right on the river with a view of Clarke Quay!
4
Had lunch here and enjoyed the experience. Right on the river.Good service by yummy looking girls.Had the fish n chip deal, Comes with Tiger beer and ice cream.Reasonable price by Singapore standards.Never done a Hooters before, nice.
5
Hooters is located at Clarke's Quay, you get to seat next to the river over looking Central Quay mall and Riverside Quay hotel. Lovely ambiance and weather. Amazing to meet your friends there over a couple of drinks.
3
Situated on the Singapore River at Clarke Quay it is a great place to watch the river taxis go by and of course admire the scantily clad waitresses, however you pay for it. I had a cheese burger with salad and curly fries and two cokes with far too much ice in them. The bill came to just under S$50 after adding taxes (√Ç¬£25). Bit steep for burger n fries in my book. Service was friendly and efficient, and they charged for that too
4
We quite enjoyed an evening overlooking the Singapore River through drinks and meals. having traveled from the US it felt like home with an American style menu. The owner personally greeted and checked in with us several times throughout our stay. Great stock after shopping through the Clarke Quay
3
I haven't been to the much famed original Hooters but can safely say that this one in Singapore is not what would make the place as famous as it is.Consolation: sitting by the boat quay and the beer was cold. Snacks were below average in taste and the whole experience ordinary for the amount of money one spends there. Well, if you want to do it as a tick box item on your list, it's ok else Singapore and Clark quay both have much better options.
3
We were invited by a supplier to have dinner at Clarke Quay and since it was crowded on Friday night we finally ended up having dinner at Hooters. With a group of 6 people we were lucky to get a table outside after short waiting time. The food however was not even average, some snacks were cold and the service was kind of poor. I suggest to look out for other places at Clarke Quay if you have a chance to get a table..
3
I went with my son and we had chicken wings and beers at Clarke Quay. Venue is great by the river. Girls are mostly beautiful but -I must admit- some of them have small hooters to be orange girls. Food is good and beer (pay 2 drink 3) was a decent deal. Influence from the high priced area is obvious. All together nice place and average food. Weekdays they are open late which is very good in the area
2
Much like McDonalds, if you have been to one Hooters then you have been to them all.But somehow the move to Singapore didn't work.Half the girls are wearing the traditional Hooters "uniform" but the rest are just in jeans and T Shirts. The expected bubbly fun service is gone and there is a distinct lack of staff over all. The fun is missing.Then there are the wings. Hooters is famous for it's great wings but again this hasn't travelled well with the wings falling well below the standard expected.If somebody was trying to copy Hooters on the cheap, this would be it
3
After browsing the many restaurants at Clarke Quay, somehow we ended up at Hooters. Food was ok, but only ok. Prices again were average. Plenty of better places to choose on the waterfront.
3
We ate here for lunch on a weekend. Service was pretty good, but there were not a lot of people in there. Staff were friendly. Food was average. Atmosphere was not too good. It may be better at night time
4
Visiting Hooters Singapore since over 15 years they are really doing a good job permanently. The service is is pretty and efficient, the drinks and the food are good and the price is ok.
2
hooters in Singapore is the most useless restaurant i have seen of hooters around the world. Services are pathetic , no. of waitress is abysmally low, so finally you get served by some men , the damn concept of hooters goes for toss. Please avoid wasting time and money on hooters
1
Why open a Hooters chain in Signapore if it cannot compare to other Hooters arpund the globe. I visit Hooters in every country that I go to but this Hooters was vile. There is no boneless chicken and the chicken wings did not have much 'chicken' on the wing. I always have the hottest sauce and my wings didnt even taste the slightest bit mild!! The burger that my husband had left an awful aftertaste in your mouth. The cocktail tasted like there was no alcohol in it. Oh and the curly fries were not even curly. Please close this Hooters down - It gives Hooters all over the world a bad name!
4
Our family love hooters and have visited a lot of restaurants in the USA and Australia. My daughter and I went here for a late lunch and were greeted by the friendly staff and seated right away. Everything we offered was great, really enjoyed the food but the atmosphere was quite boring for a hooters restaurant. We thought it would be nice sitting outside watching the boats on the river but it didn't have the same feel of a sports bar on the outside. Still the hot wings are always good no matter where you eat them.
3
We went for lunch on a weekday. We were quickly seated then had to wait 20minutes to get service from the staff even thought the place wasn't busy. We almost gave up and left. Other patrons got the staff's attention and got served before us even though we'd been there first. Once we got their attention and made our order, the food came out quickly. Good $10 lunches for my hubby and the kids but not much to choose from for vegetarians
3
We went in to Hooters as it was open along Clarke Quay for a late lunch when most restaurants were still closed! We had an enjoyable time...the service was good and our 3 teenagers enjoyed their dose of fried food!! My husband and I opted for drinks and ate elsewhere later....but that was purely choice! Overall a good experience!
2
I just had a lunch at Hooters Maybe Clark quay is not the best place to go for a lunch at Singapore, but I found the service very poor (staff seemed angry for some reason), and the food was really, really disappointing. I have to admit that this was my first experience at a Hooters, so I cannot say if this is their standard or what...but the chicken burger I had was really disappointing, absolutely no taste!Not expensive, but not worth the price either.
2
Went there for supper with friends and colleagues, after just arrived in Singapore a couple of hours earlier. We were initially walking around Clarke Quay looking for a place to eat, before finally stumbled here.We wanted to have some snacks and the chicken wings looked promising at that time. Boy, was I wrong or what. We ordered the mixed wings with drinks, beer and cocktails. When the orders arrived, I was initially pleased with the way it looked. But once I tasted them, my expectations went downhill.I cannot taste anything but soda in my mojito, the wings are like drenched with tabasco-like flavor with no other taste whatsoever, the fries were soggy and it took forever to try catching the waitresses's attention.All in all, I will not go back there anymore. Once is enough for me
3
Food was OK nothing special. Location is nice in the evening if you can get a table next to the river. Generally no a patch on the brand in USA.
1
We just wanted a non asian meal for a change. BIG MISTAKE! Burger and beef wrap were horrible. The onion rings were average. The only things that were ok were the curly fries. Service was poor basically took forever to order.
1
Some of the greasiest food I have ever seen. The menu almost makes you want to walk out the door again.. We were jet-lagged and didnt realise what we were getting ourselves into!! haha, try somewhere else!
4
Only had oysters here... Big Juicy & sweet, not salty. From Canada according to server. The curly cheese fries is soggy & comes with a small 'cup' of cheese sauce that doesn't taste remotely like cheese & definitely not enough for the bowl of fries. Want extra cheese? Pay $1.90 please.
1
Decided to try Hooters for lunch in Clarke Quay on a Saturday afternoon. Went to sit outside and wasn't greeted by any of the waitresses. Sat down outside and tried to get the servers attention for over 10 minutes. They are all walking around like zombies. The place wasn't busy at all. Looked for the manager, explained the situation and I walked out and decided to have Mexican food next door at Muchos. I was greeted at the entrance and my order was taken immediately. Give Hooters a miss in Singapore. Has gone downhill.
4
We decided to visit hooters on our first night in Singapore- mainly because we were very tired and couldn't face looking round all of the restaurants at Clarke Quay and my friends had recommended it for simple food and drink when they had been in Singapore.we chose to sit outside overlooking the river and the view was lovely as the night got darker.We ordered burgers and curly fries along with beers and cocktails and the service was really good, didn't have to wait long for the drinks once we had ordered and they were attentive, asking us if we needed more drinks and such. Didn't wait long for the food either and we both enjoyed what we had ordered. Prices here were definitely cheaper than some of the other restaurants/ bars in the area. I would eat here again or even just go for drinks here as the cocktails were lovely
3
Went there for a late night drinks with friends on a Saturday night. We have beer and a few mocktails and some finger foods. The wings, onion ring, fries are alright but still don't deserve a thumb up. There are no live band at hooters so it is a great place if you want to chat and chill with your friend here
3
The place is wonderful because it's near the river. But I can't be more patient on the food serving time. I ordered french fries and it was served later at the end even the taste was still delicious. It's quite expensive, think twice if you want to go here
3
Located close to our hotel is the Clarke Quay, and after a long, tiring day, decided to eat nearby hence Hooters. It was the only restaurant on the Quay that is half reasonably priced compared to anything else we have so far seen in this ridiculously expensive city.Upon arrival we found the service to be sadly lacking and got even worse when it took ages for a waitress to take our order. Thereafter things improved somewhat but the meals we chose, chicken wings and a Caesar Salad, left a fair bit to be desired. The Caesar Salad was more a lettuce salad but the wings were surprisingly good. Really have to rate them.The venue is well laid out and has a pretty good atmosphere about it. It even has an outdoor setting opposite the main area which provides magnificent views of the waterways.Overall, though, can only rate the experience basic and just okay
3
After reading all the bad reports post our visit was quite a surprise as our service was friendly and prompt. Guess it's all in the timing. We ordered the wings with the blue cheese sauce which were tasty and washed them down with a corona or two. All up our experience was positive and attentive and the location is perfect to pass the time away
2
I was dragged there by two friends of mine.
The place is very touristic, the food is mediocre and very expensive and the environment is just dull...
Don't ,ake the same mistake...
3
Food was OK. Service was nice but uninterested in their jobs. Locations makes up for most as it is on the river side in Clark Quay.
2
If it's girls in short skirts you want to see then stand outside and you will see them all. Food and drink not worth the price and food below the area standard
1
When we arrived the staff was terribly uninterested. Ordered wings and they never arrived, my fries (that should have been served with my wings) were served as an appetizer. When I had to cancel the wings after waiting for an hour, there was no apologizes nor an offer to fix anything
1
Ordered wings fries and my daughter ordered a grilled cheese. 10 minutes and fries come out 10 min later grilled cheese wait 10 more minutes and my daughter is done wit her food ask fr my wings and they say they will put a rush on them. You've got to be kidding! Wait longer and then I tell them to cancel and bring my bill. No apology they could care less. Also no free water you must buy bottled. No refills on soft drinks either. Lived in Singapore for 4 years have a wing fix once a year and this pace is always terrible. I will learn how to make them at home
1
Yes, this restaurant has an excellent location in Clark Quay but don't let those girls in their 'hot' shorts hoodwink you into eating there. After a long wait, the waitress comes over and declares that she's new and can't take our order. Finally our order was taken. In comes the burnt onion rings and fried pickles and fish and chips. Over-priced and below average with regard to food and service. Try the other restaurants where the happy hour is during a reasonable time
3
Ate here on our first night in Singapore. We were staying close by in Clarke Quay hotel and didn't arrive until 10 pm. Kids were hungry so we chose this as we knew the food would be to the kids liking. Good chicken wings and fries. Average service - end of shift. If you want a quick meal and a beer it's ok, otherwise try something more upmarket. Kept the kids happy
3
Love the location by the river. The food, although I did not try it, looks like the standard American fare one gets at Chillis or TGI Fridays. I just went for a beer and had I only gone the once, I would have rated the place higher.On the first day I went the service was friendly, fast and efficient. However on the second, I was given terrible service, I was standing outside the venue at the sign that says wait to be seated. One staff member walked right past me, totally ignoring me, in what was an otherwise empty outdoor section of the restaurant. It didn't get much better from there.But as I say, on the first occasion the service was fine. The beer is cold and the prices of the drinks are quite good by Singapore standards. I will likely look elsewhere in future though
1
We just went to hooters Clarke Quay for dinner today, why we choose this restaurant is because I was received a good feedback from my friends.This is our first time to visit this restaurant, we had make the reservation at 7.45pm and requested to have a outdoor seater but they ask us to proceed to indoor,Hmm...Communication problem or they don't understand?anyway, we still manage to get a outdoor seat with beautiful view.The staffs in hooters are only serve those whom they like to and not every customer they will serve and help. Another issue is the staff are keep asking if they can clear our table, we are still eating, not even finish one plate of the side dishes. One by one continuous asking and asking, what the rude staffs!!! Their behaviors make us felt uncomfortable at all, we are paying the money and ordered 1 main course, 3 side dishes and 2 tiger beer. We not even spend more than an hour, they started to chase.I will not recommend my friend to this restaurant, this is my first and the last to visit this suck restaurant!!
1
When we walk in the "STAFF" there totally don't want to serve us and there is a table available but the "BAD ATTITUDE STAFF" said that table belongs to other restaurant, but their menu is on that table. TOTALLY IS A BAD RESTAURANT, BAD STAFF WITH BAD ATTITUDE I NEVER ME
3
We stopped in to take advantage of the lunch special. Basic pub grub and quite reasonable considering the location. Food was good but simple fare and in line with the style of restaurant. Couldn't fault the food or service just not for us.
2
Very disappointing food quality and the service wasn't up to much either. Clarke Quay is a nice place to visit in the evening but if I go again I will select a different restaurant.
3
The restaurant located at Clarke Quay is an ideal place to chill and unwind. Food could have been better...but who cares when you are at Hooters ;)
Great service ...look forward to coming back !!!
3
Great atmosphere in Clarke Quay! Restaurant included flat screen TV's with sports, large tables, bar stools and string lighting. Slow service however wait staff was friendly and attractive. Drinks and food overpriced but large menu and nice air conditioning indoors.
4
My first ever visit to any hooters. Service was fast & good. The appetizers/bites portions was good and tasty. A nice place to chill out, have beers and chit chat.
5
Loved their food and Clarke Quay is my fave forever. So the location was great to sip on a glass of beer. Great work. Keep it up.
4
I had a yummy steak that was cooked just the way I like it. Also a beautiful setting in the evening sitting outside beside the river.
4
Wandering around Clarke's quay with my boyfriend he was pretty keen to go into hooters. It was extremely hot at the time so it was nice to have the option of a lovely air conditioned section inside or out by the river.We visited for lunch and the food was nice and just what we expected from an American diner environment.Reasonably priced and great service.For a quick bite to eat I would definitely recommen
1
I went there on labour day at night to have desserts n drinks. Ordered apple crumble which came out just from the microwave n was horrible. Fried ice cream? Double horrible I rather get an ice cream from 7-11.To the extend we did also order the worst tasteless mojito ever in my life. Ice cubes chuck with mints leaf with pile of lime juice with no taste of rum at all. Eventually I told the staff there wasn't any gin in mojito,the staff tell me "oh ok there's no gin in there.i will check for you,n never come back to me. Really gin? Omg you don't even know what's inside mojito. It's rum crush ice,crush mints leaf squeeze of fresh lime,brown sugar.both mojito I ordered was almost full when full bill was presented. No one cares.
3
Hooters Singapore was the first Hooters that I ever visited and I enjoyed it so much that I have been to many others since. I always make a point of buying merchandise to take back for friends and family. However this vist was extremely disappointing. The food was ok but the staff were pretty disinterested in us and made us feel that we were a bit inconvenient for them. The place looked grubby and rundown. We went to buy T Shirts but the range was very limited and no one seemed too interested in serving us or showing us what we wanted to see so we left empty handed. I have never left a Hooters restaurant without spending a least $200 on merchandise so this should indicate how poor things really were. Sorry to my friends who were looking forward to Hoiters Souvenirs - maybe Hard Rock instead!
4
Came here for lunch. The girls were very friendly and service was great. Food was pretty good, would probably go back
5
If you like having beer and chicken wings, this is the place to visit....the buffalo wings damn good and spicy(if u choose to have it spicy) a must go place.....
5
Great Food. Reasonable price. Right on the Singapore River. Beautiful Girls to wait on you. Nice short Shorts and great Bums.
3
It was quick, friendly and not too bad. Had tables by the water which were nice. service was slow, but then it's not michelin star so what do you expect!
4
This was my second visit to Hooters In Singapore. once again I had the chicken wings and enjoyed them again.
Great place to visit for a quick feed and a cold beer.
1
It was my first and definitely LAST time at hooters. Freaking drank a nail. A nail!!!! in my magarita. Thinking about it makes me wanna puke! ! Hygiene levels are really really bad.
2
Popped in for a late lunch today ,Monday 21st April. I ordered the Ribs and my Wife had Tiger Prawn Pasta.Ribs were under cooked , mentioned this to the waitress and asked her to inform the Chef and Manager.I never received any kind of apology or the offer of another meal which I thought was a bit much.Shall not be returning there on any of my future trips to Singapore.PS My wife's pasta was delicious
2
Was here on the 15th of april. Ordered a Johnny Walker Black label , but was given some other whisky. I objected , but, the waitress insisted it was Black label. So I let it go. The drink was served with soda and ice filled up in a tumbler and teh whisky in a shot glass.Never seen this done in any place.Ordered fried shimps. The sauce was awful , I just left the palce without finishing my dinner or the snack
4
Went here for a late lunch/snack and ordered the button mushrooms and mozarella cheese sticks. One word = Yum! Food came out quickly and was very fresh. The views and breeze was fantastic and the drink service was efficient. If you are looking for somewhere to chill and kick back, come to Hooters
3
Hooters at Clarke Quay positively surprised me. Stopped there more for sitting down on their terrace and watching the traffic on Singapore River than for having dinner, but ordered anyhow a meal called ‚ÄúBeef Fondue‚Äù. The meal was tasty, the beer cold and the service was OK so I can only recommend this place
3
Had a late lunch here, mainly snack food, reasonably priced. Staff were friendly and efficient. Set on river with nice outlook, out seating if wanted or also indoor.
3
Pricey slow service with about as much charm and fun as melted chocolate, the saving grace was the fried pickles and the prawn pasta...amazing but will not go back again considering Clarke Quay has so many good restaurants and bars to choose from.
4
in the heart of clarke quay... girls are all good looking....cold beer and the fried chicken is great
4
Been here the other night eith a friend. Ambiance is great. Beer in pitcher and fish with salad are good combination. Service is great. A good view of the river. Stayed in the tables set up outside.
4
This is my regular hangout for lunch. It makes great sense to patronise this place:Location - central and convenient. Two hour free parking is welcomed- to avoid ERP, pop in just before 12 noonFood- $10 + $2.50 offers a good value set lunch comprising a main course (choose from 10), soft drink, soup, coffee and ice creamService - girls after friendly and prompt. Except for one local, maybe 2 from PRC the rest are pinays.Ambience- nice, warm and sporty. Big tv screens to catch sport
3
Great location in the middle of Clarke Quay (party / after work / tourist bar area of Singapore). Took a while to get served. Staff wasn't really friendly (but maybe it was only because it was busy when we were there and they couldn't handle it). They had a happy hour formula which made it affordable to drink alcohol (order 3, pay 2). Cocktails were sweet. We didn't order food
4
I had lunch one afternoon just landed in Singapore, I knew this place, I'd never been but I had already noticed hovering in front. The location is great, if you take a table outside you will have a beautiful view of the river and the view of the boats that cruise is very romantic. To be in Singapore prices were average, and the service was good, two handsome waitress served us quick and well without making us miss anything, even complementary ice cream after a meal. All in all I would say that eating here was a great choice
3
Dined as a group of four for lunch mainly cause it is one of not many food options available in the area at that time of the day. first impression wasn't good and the staff really seemed like they didn't want to be there (this was the outside eating area and the staff inside seemed a little better mannered), food was really good, well we had just been eating Asian food for the week before. Their $15 lunch including burger or steak (there were other options), beer, soft drink and ice cream was really well price for Singapore and filled us up. but for well priced food in Singapore I suppose you can put up with bad service
3
Bleh! This place was playing such depressing Rhianna music from 5 years ago. Everyone outside on the Singapore river looked so unhappy with such music. I had asked them to change it but they refused. If I hadnt already ordered the food I would not have stayed. People on holidays are looking to relax and enjoy the scenery without having a woman singing about a suicidal boyfriend. Finally some good Robbie Williams came on which they ended up skipping half way through the song. Whats more is that the staff were not very friendly or enthusiastic (with that music who can blame them?)Otherwise the food was lovely. The beef fondue was delectable and the chicken wraps were delicious. It was nice food but nothing spectacular. Also my prepaid credit card got declined twice there for no reason.  I would not return here as there are definitely much better places to eat in Singapore
5
I guess like a lot of guys and girls, a hooters bar is well known around the world and this was one place on my trip I wanted to go to and have that Experiance and try the food that you hear about. Well the food and drinks were great and at a good price. The service was pretty good too, I think my girl friend enjoyed it more than me even
5
From staff sexy uniform to great food taste and location, prices are great. if i had time sure i would come back many times.
2
Had a dinner here and the food quality was so so. The burger was a mess, dry and not appealing when served. The baby back ribs was just ok. Prefer to have Chili's over hooters anytime.
3
I found the place noisy, not lively noisy but really noisy.
The food and drink are just about ok. The staff are very friendly and chirpy.
They also have a selection of Hooters t shirts you can buy.
4
Everything you would expect from a Hooters. Fun place to hang out for a few beers and chicken wings. Great location.
4
The wife actually suggested visiting here! We liked it enough the first time we came back for lunch later in our visit to Singapore.The prices are very reasonable. The $10 lunch was a bargain! The food was of reasonable quality considering the price paid. The atmosphere was 'lively' but comfortable. You can sit inside, or outside right on the deck on the waters of Clarke Quay.The service was average, but reasonable enough. It took some time to get one of the waitresses attention at times but they were very busy, so not their fault. Perhaps a couple more on that day would have helped
5
Visited the place with my wife im July 2013.. Actually it's our first time here.. Food:The food was definitely much better than average.. The pork ribs and steak was a delight.. Athmosphere:We can sense that everyone ishaving fun... Service: even though the girls were very busy running around all over the place, i do find that they give good service despite the hecticnes
4
if you want to eat a late meal in singapore - your surest bet is clark quay.if you want to eat something familiar and tasty - hooters is an good choicesince a lot of the establishments there aren't very goodhad chicken wings ("3 mile island" hotness level) which were good and a frozen margarita which compared to others I've had in Singapore - was pretty good.Waitresses mostly are cute and thre service was good, the place was clean, and the place at midnight was nearly full, and its a big place to
4
Hooters sum-up is quiet simple: good chicken wings, and crazy hot chicks.The orange short worn by the whole team of Asian model is kind of their signature, and that's a good one.!Try the hottest sauce for the chicken wings ( yeah this place is about hot stuff..!), and enjoy the finger food with a great ice-cold beer

As sad as it is to admit, the Hooters in Singapore doesn't come close to the food taste or quality found in the US. The service here also lacks a fair a bit and we found it quite slow and unresponsive. Food was okay, but clark quay looks to have better options
3
We went to Clarke Quay on a Saturday for lunch and not many places along the riverfront were open - so we thought we'd give the Hooters lunch special a try mainly because the location was so nice. We actually enjoyed what we chose - the lunch special (NZ steak) wasn't huge in size but for $10 + $5 for a Tiger and including ice-cream dessert represented reasonable value and was cooked just as ordered! Waitresses were polite, service was good and location was excellent. I'd actually rate it a 3.5 - better than 'average' but not quite 'very good'
3
Didn't stand out as good food/atmoshpere etc but then we stopped by just for a burger and a beer at lunch time. The food was ok, staff were ok.

No boneless chicken wings. The sauces are different also.
Burger was very dry and the bacon was digusting and burnt. Took forever to get our bill also.
Not worth it, should've went elsewhere.

My husband loves burgers and our friends brought us to Clarke Quay on our last night in Singapore so we decided on Hooters as it was an American company. Three of us ordered burgers with cheesy curly fries and one ordered the fish and chips. They have this odd starter which is battered pickles (sliced gherkins) to start with I didn't believe I would find them as addictive as the menu made out they were but they were certainly enjoyable and I was sad when they ran out. The burgers are nothing to write home about - one friend had it with the works, one with cheese and I had mine with mushrooms and chilli. Hooters is famous in the US for their waitresses who wear very short shorts and tight vest tops and the same theme continues in their branch in Singapore. At least I can say I've tried the place but I probably wouldn't go back again as I think it is overpriced for what it is and as they describe it on their website it is tacky

This restaurant is an absolute disaster!!!! The food is not fit for dogs.I dined here with friends because of good experience at hooters in california. The experience at hooters singapore was totally different and they dont deserve the franchise name. For exampls you can actually talk to your server in the states and they arent rushed. The girls in the states maks time to talk fo you and make you feel welcome and they have bus boys to do the clear tables etc to free up the girls. In the states you come for the girls first, food second, the location doesnt matter. In singapore its totally backwards. But why? It could be both and make more money doing it! In my group we had steak, a burger and a chicken salad. All were amoung the worst examples of each type of food. The salad was absolutely ridiculous.. everything unsliced on a flat plate, impossible to eat and tasteless. It is obvious that whoever is responsible for the menu has never eaten a good salad, never tried a good steak and is just trying to be cheap on using poor ingredients.Another massive problem is the outside sitting area. We couldnt take the best seats next to the water because a group sat down, one person drank a soda and the other 3 kept asking for tap water... for 2hours straight on a busy night!! The girl serving them was obviously reluctant to keep giving them tap water. I want to suggest to the managers of hooters singapore: make the outside area or the row nearest the water your VIP area, charge a flagfall or have a higher priced menu for that section. Also give the guests a time limit in the VIP. Personally i find it irritating to make a large dinner order and get worse seats. Im happy to pay to sit somewhere better and most people with money are too.This was not my first time at this restaurant, previously i had a very good experience just having drinks and being served by a tall filipina, i think her name was Sarah but not sure. Her service was perfect, friendly, very polite and the best attitude. She also had the look you would expect from a real hooters girl (unlike the others)... in other words she had hooters! This girl saved my opinion of hooters for a night.... however, the place is in general could be such a better earner, its location and name has the potential to dominate the riverside

One of the popular joint in Clarke Quay, along the Singapore River. Like the name says, its an American slang of woman's breast. So you get to see most of the sexy waitress waiting for you. Mostly Filipinas, being hooters girl will take your orders for the nights. Serving most of the beers and wine, and the specialty for food is there platter and BBQ ribs. The Hooters girl are quite friendly but busy most of the time running around. I was a bit unfortunate that night as my order came the cutlery on the plate actually poked my stomach. The Hooter girl was a bit rude blaming me for her mistake. So I demanded a apology, only then she apologize after my anguish. Food was just alright but most people come to see the hooter and chillout

My friend in SG brought us here since of the waitress was her friend. Place was great, we went on a weekend and there was quite a crowd at clark quaye. Food was great, we had wings and beer. We also got the dessert for free. Service was also okay, and I think the place had a good value for your money. Would surely come back here when we visit SG again

Its on a nice location in Clarke Quay by river side. One can enjoy cool breeze in evening with beautiful boats in river. This restaurant is famous for its waitresses. They serve American fast food, which a quite okay but i cant say it was amazing

Hooters Singapore is located is Clark Quay. It is an excellent location and is a boulevard type of area with restaurants a plenty. Some of the restaurants including Hooters has a nice view as it is facing the river. The service was pretty good. One of our guests felt one of the drinks did not live up to his expectation. We made a request on this to one of the waiters and they obliged our request by making some changes.For beverages there is a host of alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks one can order.The main attraction here is the finger food including what the famous for which is the buffalo wings. We sampled 2 portions of their buffalo wings, the mild and the slightly spicy nuclear. Both versions were quite disappointing and did not live up to expectations. I have tried the wings in US Hooters and it is definitely better. This one was a bit dry and they sauce was not too great. The saving grace was the Quesadilla an satay which were quite good. Overall it was not too bad an experience, but we just expected their wings to be better as this is their signature dish

We had lunch there today. The non-local girl who served us are in shorts and sleeveless top. She was friendly and serve us with a smile. We had the lunch promotion with additional top up with S$2+ to get a tea/coffee and ice cream. Another non local girl served us, who is wearing a white tshirt with jeans, was a tad unfriendly with a little attitude. As she served our ice cream, one of the cup slip and the ice cream fall on the tray. She pick it up and put a side. Then we told her we want the ice cream to be take-away. She then left the ice cream at the counter outside the outdoor (as we were seated outside) and went to the kitchen to pick up the container. Then when she came out, I approach her and asked if she is changing the ice cream since was it fell on the tray, she replied "THE TRAY IS CLEAN". And I said, yes but it fall on the tray and it is unhygienic. She kept repeating "but the tray is CLEAN". I demand her to change 3x before she bring the ice cream into the kitchen unwillingly. First of all, she left the ice cream outdoor and went to the kitchen to pick up the container and intend to put our ice cream into the container outside is already not so right. The ice cream is melting outside while she takes her time to the kitchen and come back. 2nd she accidentally drop the ice cream, the tray may be clean, but shouldn't she change a new one since it was her fault? And how we know how clean is the tray? Excuse me, we pay for the service charge, is the way how the food should be treated

I really enjoyed my lunch at Hooters. Had the famous chicken wings which they offer in a variety of spice levels. Food was quickly served after ordering, was really tasty and the waitresses all seemed to have a smile on their faces, despite reading previous reviews of this being a rarity. Overall would recommend as a one off if you happen to be In Singapore and fancy some good old fashioned american comfort food
3
The wings are the only reason why we go. The 3-mile flavour is super tangy and spicy. For those who like spicy food, this is the seasoning. Other food items are average... Not worth the trip if you are not taking the wings.
3
Spicy wings good with beer, great seats next to the water while people watching everyone going by.
Simple, not very healthy food, but well executed with good service
4
lovely walk along Clarke quay brought me to this restaurant. the view along the river is superb and the food is great. Beer served in chilled glasses goes down a treat.
3
Staff are great and service is prompt but the cleanliness of the restrooms is not to standard.....hmm made us wonder what the kitchens look like.....Food was okay but nothing to wow us. Good locations in Clarkes Quay on the river with a choice of air conditioned restaurant of sitting outside next to the river
3
My first time at this restaurant was around 15 years ago, when Clark Quay had just opened and Singapore was beginning to loosen up. At that time, the waitresses were more cheerful and charming and the personality of the restaurant resulted it being a novelty. My wife, daughter, and I had dinner here over the weekend as part of our Easter holiday vacation and I noted that the charm was wearing off. The waitresses, although courteous, looked tired and lacked joy in their demeanor. The quality of the food remained the same as the chicken wings continued to be the best choice. Nevertheless, still a lot of people came to the restaurant and some just left because there was no longer any room. If you haven't been to a Hooters yet, worth the visit
3
We were seated and then waited 20 min for anyone to say anything to us. In this time others were seated, ordered, and received drinks. Tried to make eye contact with waitresses who just looked at the floor. The old "I'm busy don't bother me" trick. Got up to leave when security noticed and got us service. The food we got was ok, but very mass produced and bland. Kind of place you go to to say you've been there; but never retur

Pretty and sexy waitress as known worldwide. Ordered chicken wings, BBQ baby back ribs, long island tea and cider. Chicken wings is recommended. There are many sauces for your choice.Nice scenery as the restaurant is located just next to the river. Open till late night as the crowd is more when the night is getting 'younger'
3
The venue is good, de oratio. Similar to other franchise with same name of it. Quality of the food are so so but they have a good deal of promotion for like chicken wing and also lunch set plus beer. Its a good hangout place, mostly for the beer and snack
4
I have been craving to try this restaurant even before I was planning to go to Singapore. When finally I got a chance to go there, I directly ordered their famous chicken wings. It was more than my imagination. The chicken wings were so juicy & tender. I was not a big fan of chicken wing before, but Hooters make me fall in love with them now. I ordered waffle for dessert too and it was good. The ice cream did not get melt easily, so convenient for me as a slow eater. The price was reasonable, might be considered cheap for Singaporeans, and they provide outdoor & indoor area. The outdoor area was perfect for lazy afternoon dining with colleagues. You can see water taxi going around you. If you are in Singapore, Clarke Quay particularly, you must try this restaurant
5
still loves this restaurant. the wings sooo yummy. i ordered the spiciest one and it is delish. the oyster also good. the service can be improved with more smiles but we r fine. we always get everything not too long even though it was busy friday nite. will definitely go back there next visit.
3
whilst a bit of a novalty place, we found it over priced and lousy service and the food was very average also
3
While the food was okay the whole Clarke Quay thing is okay to look around but overpriced and very touristy
2
The food was great. Love the buffalo wings & mozzarella sticks. Definitely not like the American experience, sub standard in that respect. I'll start saving my hard earned for Ft Lauderdale or Palm Beach
1
I order a chicken caeser salad which consisted of mainly lettuce, a little chicken and nothing else. Very tasteless and disappointing. My partner ordered the fish which wasn't even cooked properly. I wouldn't recommend eating at Hooters in Singapore. We went there as we arrived late and everywhere else was busy - do not go here to eat even if you are desperate
3
Hooters hoots that they serve great food to satisfy the palate and great curves to jolly up the eyes. Well Ive been to places that does either quite well but never been to a place that does both and sadly Hooters in Sg does not do so either. In fact I Hooters Sg does not excell in either, I got a burger that was dry and tough ( thats a rarity for a burger) and bland tasting, my mate got pasta in garlic oil but the garlic was burnt leaving a nasty bitter aftertaste. They say they have not lost sight of their true calling but with what I have tasted they must have. And this goes for the gurls too, I mean I see extra curves on the sides and might as well change the name to chubby chickies than hooters.Over-all I think people go there because the name is famous and you want to say that Ive been to hooters but if you want value for your money and want to have good food served, skip this one
4
Found this place by chance. They do a $10 lunch deal which includes dessert (icecream) and soft drink. If you order a beer it will only cost $5 with this deal instead of $9.20. Wine was reasonable (for Singapore) too - $10.50 instead of $14-$16 + in other places. Clarke Quay is picturesque - water taxis and bum boats abound and there are lots of restaurants around which offer a set lunch but we found this one the best value. (All prices are shown in Singapore $). Loved it - went three times and would recommen

I had to see what Hooters in Singapore was like! It was just like home as far as the food and quality and the TVs around the place to watch all manner of sporting activities. If you need to use the restroom, look for other places, as this one is one of the worst that I have ever seen in a restaurant with an American name on it
4
Only $10 (+ tax and service charge) or lunch- choice of quite a few mains, drink and ice cream! I had a burger and it was actually delicious- was very surprised at how nice it was! Very good value for singapore and you can sit along the river which is nice!

We were there one Saturday lunch with my family. The not so sexy waitresses are not at all polite and service-oriented. The food in a regular fastfood is the same here, nothing fancy but the price. Another horrible experience is when the calamansi juice I ordered was served in another table next to ours. The man sitting in that table just accepted the order. Few moments later another waitress realized that my juice was still not in our table and was instead served in the other table. What she did was just get the juice order from that table, from that man who I didn't know if he touched it or not, and drop it in our table, that's it. No apology or explanation, whatsoever. To my disgust I did'nt touch, drink that juice and lost my appetite. Highly NOT recommended
1
I am more than a regular traveller to Singapore. I have been there over the last 28 years at least 70 times. But my experience at Hooters can be rated as the worst ever experience in a restaurant in Singapore. The service was absolutely a shame. Unfriendly and not motivated. The food was literally dumped on our table without looking at us. The waitress in our area was only interested in the drunken Chinese business men. To made it worse the food was below all standards and when I settled the bill and asked why I both had to sign as well as entering my pincode the manager got so mad that he started to scream that this is his place and that I had to do whatever they tell me to do. I can tel you that I was shocked by this attitude as well as the service standards of this place. Never again
5
Of course, we went to Hooters for the boys but the staff were so friendly, and kept the baby amused while my daughter ate her meal. The food was fantastic, probably the best meal in Clarke Quay.
1
Avoid this hooters if you expect the same service like those in US.The waitresses are unfriendly. Throughout my 2 hours stay, I hardly see any of the waitresses smiling. They just came in take your order and deliver them in an expressionless face. That's all.Food are so-so. Wings is average. The only good thing are the salsa with chips
3
Excellent on the river bar location. Some pretty good drink specials. More of a lunch type menu, but cool outside bar to drink & hang out at. For food they cant compete with the variety of other restaurants in Clarke Quay. Good warm up spot for the clubs
2
I stayed in Singapore for 3 weeks and I tried Hooters in Clarke Quai. The food was acceptable, the drinks too, but the price was very high.The place is good, but all the Clarke Quai restaurants has good places, so why to choose Hooters?There's no reason to choose Hooters for dinner and also post dinner. Is a typical western food restaurant with very expensive prices.I really don't want to suggest anybody this place...there are more restaurant better then this one
3
I knew this restaurant because i watched reality shop in television about the founder of this restaueant..so i decided to try when i knew it was open in Singapore. The place was great,beside the river, and the restaurant has indoor n outdoor area..i ate the famous chicken wings with original flavour, but the taste was like the others chick wings. So i add the oriental sauce n i like it...dont order fruit juice because its like the fruit juices in the supermarket..others visitors ordered beer n i think thats the perfect match for the wings..the price a little bit expensive but its ok for me..Its famous also cause all the waiters wear sexy uniform
3
I had to try this one as I frequent the original Hooters in Clearwater and Port Richey Florida as often as possiblePretty much the same as any other Hooters apart from the girls are generally a little smaller and not as much banterYou can sit inside or out, outside is looking over the river.As usual the girls take good care of you.Don‚Äôt try to compare prices with the Hooters in the US as with most things in Singapore the price is higher than the US for just about everythin
3
Having been to a number of Hooter outlets in the states, I always look forward to dropping by Hooters Singapore for the pork ribs and a cold beer and buffalo wings.However, must state the buffalo wings are not as spicy as they should be and the general quality of the food could be much, much better....its alright, its average..but nothing to shout about which is not in the traditions of Hooters.Improvements can be made and the saving grace is the filipino waitresses who are friendly, professional...Go because its your first time eating there but...there are better other options along Clarke Quay I think from a food quality point of view
4
The location is one of the most happening on the island of Singapore, located right at Clarke Quay, the drinks are a bit on the expensive side. The waitresses are very friendly and efficient. Ordered for chicken wings and cheese fries, very tasty indeed. The place can get very noisy and crowded on weekends, but the place is worth a visit, esp. considering the first Hooters in Asia
3
We went down the riverside of clarke quay and find a good place to eat. Found this one and this was the cheapest with their promo with good value. Still expensive but it's Singapore, nothing cheap. We got 10$ package includes hooters burger, coke, and free ice cream. The burger wasn't that great, very simple with red beans. The ice cream as good, only one scoop though. But, really, not a really great venue to have your lunch or even dinner. Try something else and you will get the better ones. The staffs were very friendly though and kind. And hot. Hahaha
3
Food was average, location is noisy, waitresses are friendly and attentive.But, it *is* Hooters and for that fact alone it's worth a visit.I had ribs which were OK, a bit fatty but covered in lovely sauce.The drinks were quite expensive, but if you are sitting on Clarke Quay you don't expect to find a cheap watering hole.Fun but don't expect a gourmet meal
4
As usual the food was good and the service good a very good location this not a girly bar but a relaxing place to have a drink and meal
3
Please do not think Hooters here in Singapore are like the ones in the US, its not. Nice place to drop by to have a drink.Great snack food like the Buffalo wings
3
Same food, same look... not quite the same "hooters" but very nice. Good place for a beer and to watch a game....
4
We watched a televised soccer match over dinner at Hooters. The atmosphere and service were great. I loved the fried pickles.
1
We stopped in while walking around see in the sights. Having been to the Hooters in the USA the facility looked the same. Ordered cheese fries and drinks. Fries were hot but cheese was the the canned nacho cheese that was terriable. I ordered Iced Tea which tasted terriable
4
I used to live in US for 7 yers and ate lots of hooters. The singapore one taste just like it. Super yummy. The only different is the waiters in US is much much nicer than in Singapore. The food r the same though. Yummy. Always make time to go here everytime we r in Singapore. Try the wings and the oysters. They r awesom
3
Our party of 8 had lunch at Hooters on a Monday, thinking about enjoying the 99 cent serve of Buffalo wings with every jug of Tiger beer. But after looking at the price of a jug of beer, we all decided instead on having the $10 lunch special. I had the Caesar salad (forgot to ask for chicken, which is extra) and an iced lemon tea, which was nice enough.The girls taking orders and serving us were friendly and I like the way they send the orders to the kitchen, via a metal clip and a long wire (aka flying fox). The food came out quick enough as the restaurant wasn't very busy and we found very little reason to linger after lunch, except to visit the conveniences. The men's bathroom has pictures of (I'm assuming) American Hooters girls all over the walls.You can also buy souvenirs and shirt etc at the front of the restaurant, which were reasonably priced. I'd imagine that Hooters (and Clarke Quay in general) would be a lot busier and exciting in the evening
1
The worst looking food & worst tasting food we have ever eaten!!! We thought it would be safe USA style food for a quick bite however, the burger came with a 2mm microwaved bun & the meat was sloppy & quite disgusting. The worst thing were the buffalo prawns. They looked so bad we just didn't want to try them in case of poisoning!Staff were grumpy & didn't even care or bat an eyelid or apologise when we complained. They were not interested. The full plates were quickly removed by them without even questioning anything. We left within 3 mins of our food arriving. Awful food. Sack the cook as he/she is definitely NOT a chef
4
Have always wanted to try hooters for there famous BUFFALO wings & blue cheese sauce, Since we haven't been to the US yet Singapore hooters was my 1st attempt. Went at lunch time & wasn't overly crowdered.Ordered Buffalo chicken wings in 911 sauce & blue cheese sauce on side, was nice but not as hot as what I thought they would be, but very tasty, also ordered fried pickles.....actually pretty good, like weird chips or fries, good with beer, The wife had a chicken burger & said it was really nice.Staff are very friendly, Quick service.Overall not to bad
4
While vacationing in Singapore we enjoyed two meals at the Hooters at Clarke Quay. The hot wings and curly fries were identical in taste and portion size to the wings I've enjoyed at Hooters in Florida. The raw oysters were fresh and delicious, and the fried shrimp was so good I was tempted to order more. Other dishes include crab legs, burgers, and a philly cheesesteak sandwich. The food came out very quickly but the service wasn't as good as I would have liked. Also, please note that there are no free refills on softdrinks like there are in the US and you will be charged. We bought souvenir t-shirts and noted as we did so that the interior of the restaurant and uniforms the girls wear are the same as in the states. It's a nice place to go if you are in the mood for good wings and beer.
