Great food and service, but cuisine not fully authentic. Various Chinese cuisine. Food generally delicious, so it is fine.

Went for business lunch. Mostly Sichuan food but some other region - mostly Cantonese food - mixed somewhat. Also their famous Knife-shaven noodle is nice but not really 100% Sichuan food. But if you want nice environment business lunch or dinner, I recommend this place.

Silk Road, situated on the 2nd floor of the Amara Hotel, serves up the best Dan Dan noodle dish in Singapore. The speciality of the house is spicy Szechuan dishes. Their dim som and wonton are excellent. While the atmosphere is not spectacular (it's in a hotel after all), the food more than makes up for it.

We were looking to eat Szechuan food and happened to come upon this restaurant.The decor was a little bit sterile, food was decent but service by Joanne was excellent. We actually came away having learned more about Chinese food. Thank you Joanne for the pride and passion you put into your work
