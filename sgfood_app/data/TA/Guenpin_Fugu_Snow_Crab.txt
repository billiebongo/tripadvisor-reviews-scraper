It is a rare treat to be able to try puffer fish in Singapore. The snow crab and puffer fish are fresh and tasty. Presentation and service are exemplary and charming. Definitely worth a visit.

We ordered the puffer fish set meal and snow crab set meal. Had different way of having the puffer fish & snow crab from sashimi, boil to deep fried. The snow crab is very fresh and sweet. Very good and we love it.

Our first try at Puffer Fish.. enjoyed the meal. Taste of Puffer is refreshing, lightly sweet. Texture is great, chewy. Love the Puffer Fish skin. Snow Crab is great.. the meal allows u to taste the seafood cooked different way. Price is not cheap though

The Tiger Puffer fish is the top end of Fugu. Very fresh and the snow crab sashimi is succulent. Thumbs up!

One of the best meals I had this year. My three year old dinner companion kept asking for more crabs. She would only say oishi to the jap chef after a piece of crab was fed to her. And she loved the Fugu too.

High quality fugu done many ways, from sashimi to grill, Nothing disappoints. For variety, show crab options are available. Decent selection of sakes to pick from as well.

We had the puffer hotpot and the fish was served in a variety of ways to deliver an array of tasteful experiences. The puffer fish really tasted fresh and undoubtedly authenticates the mastery of the Chef. Happy hour was also worth the price for the free flow of sake

The service staffs were mostly great. Though there was a hiccup on the food, but it was rectified promptly. It is a different experience as pufferfish is not widely available in Singapore. Even though the portions seemed not big, but many dishes in the set, so will be filling!
