If you are not healthy conscious and just want an ice cream, this is not the place for you. For the diehards, the ingredients stay true to its healthy roots.

Great acai bowls, interesting mixes and options. Healthy option along the way, the only problem is that the staff is not very friendly

Very recommended especially for the vegan. They do serve in several sizes, flavors and toppings. üëçüëç

I visited PA on a busy weekend, looking to infuse some superfoods into my system after a week of overindulging. To say that I enjoyed the experience doesn't even begin to cover it. I relished every single bite of a large original flower bowl. The decor of the cafe was excellent and made me extremely at home. The service was attentive and superb. I will be back as often as I can.

hands down best acai bowls I've had so far, in the world. I'm not exaggerating I've been to many countries & had acai bowls (as I'm newly obsessed with them) & they just cannot beat the ones in Singapore. A bit pricey but that's nothing new for the country. Just. SO. GOOD. Check out my IG for pics @christelleeex

Highly recommend this place, I've visited this place a few times and my first ever acai bowl was from Project Acai. Get the handy flower bowl if you are not super hungry or get the large bowl if you're hungry. The supergreens Acai bowl is a acquired taste...

We went to the branch on the East Coast Road. Acai is purple coloured berries from Brazil. It is used as a key ingredient to make smoothies and other kinds of deserts that are supposed to be healthy. The health comes at a price as average cost is about $10. Personally I find the taste bland without the less healthy ingredient s such as ice cream ..

Love it, love it, love it! I used to live next to the Holland Village branch, now I live next to the Joo Chiat branch which is even bigger, and has lovely natural light, so hanging out there with an acai bowl and friends or just a good book is a great way to spend the afternoon.Their original bowl is packed full of fresh fruit making it sweet and the ultimate ic cream replacement. It's healthy in vitamins, but do remember it is a massive calorie hit. My personal favorite is a acai and nut bowl. Something about the peanut butter flavor combo with the acai just does it for me.They have a new flavor which is a green acai (I think it is spinach and kale?), which gives the bowl a more savory note and my missus loves that one now. It's not bad, but I prefer the other two.One note to Project Acai, if you're reading this, pls can you start to soak the chia seeds in water before serving. It is a healthier and more delicious way to serve them. Try it!Highly recommended to everyone, and the perfect replacement to ice cream

Refreshing, flavourful and filled w goodies like granola, chia seeds, grapes and bananas for a light and nutritious bite. So good! But on the pricey side sadly.

I visit this place everytime I'm in Singapore to have an inexpensive and healthy breakfast. Delicious a√ßai bowls that look s√≥ pretty.

Small and stylish dessert place to experience something new. We shared the sundae bowl which was very good and with 3 more fresh strawberries this would be excellent.

Love the recommended menu from this cafe!! Look so healthy and very tasty..suits for the person who loves healthy foods

Had the large flower bowl for dinner actually and it was actually very filling :) I am personally not a big fan of bananas so the second time I went, I asked for the bananas to be substituted with grapes and the friendly staff were more than happy to do so! There are two outlets and the one at Holland village is definitely more pleasant if you are planning to sit around and chill with your acai bowl.

My very first acai bowl experience. I loved it!Had the medium flower bowl ($1 top up for almond butter). Wish there was more almond butter, I cldn't really taste it, and cldn't help feeling like my top up was for nothing...The acai blend was delicious though, and the bowl was a great mid afternoon snack. Think I'll size up my next visit!I stay away frm dairy most days, and am forever on the hunt for ice cream alternatives. This is a great one

This place is very trendy and hip in its decor. The original mix bowl is filled and mixed with great abundance of energy and natural tasting fruits that is both refreshing and healthy. Love the granola and chia seeds within!Congratulations to both Melissa and Debbie for bringing this to Singapore

One word... YUM! This wasn't the first time visiting this lovely quaint acai cafe but wow I absolutely loved my project acai sundae bowl!!! So much flavour, I didn't want the bowl to end. I have also tried their signature flower bowl (so fresh and fruity) and their nuts for acai bowl (another very flavoursome meal). Prices range between $9 and $14 depending on size! I would recommend getting the medium or large bowl, you will be begging for more trust me

Acai bowls are too sweet , Sugary apple juice is added to make the bowls sweet. There are many other places which are much better like go juice close to downtown mrt , basically would not recommend . Best bowls are still in Hawaii this is nowhere close.

I love coming to Project A√É¬ßai and getting their nut bowl with cookie butter. It's fresh and great as a snack, however the price is high and $9-12 for a bowl isn't too great. I would recommend trying it once as there are many other healthy options out there for less cost.

Tried the outlet in Holland Village today. The A√ßai bowl with fruit is really refreshing and tasty but at nearly $15 it's certainly not something to have every day. Worthwhile for the occasional visit though.

Me and my friend went in without knowing that it is near closing time. It is so expensive and we were indirectly pressured into finishing in within like 10 mins because they started to off the lights and take out their brooms to pack up:((

First attempt and i love the taste! So fresh, healthy and without preservatives, gluten free etc. It almost replaces a meal.

I love this stuff. It's cold and refreshing on a hot day (which is everyday in Singapore), but at the same time it's much healthier than a bowl of ice cream (or so they say). As with most health food things here, it's expensive. Definitely an occasional treat rather than a daily health staple. My favourite thing in here is the cookie butters!!I also tried their sorbet - it's pretty good, too. It's basically their acai blend, frozen. You can also buy take home packs of the blend to make it yourself (probably for less!)

Acai bowl cafes were all over New York City when I recently visited and I fell in love with them so I was excited to try this place out. I was very disappointed. Why? Well the bowls are very expensive for a start and the signs all around the place make ridiculous claims about amazing health benefits---yes, they can be healthy but let's be realistic. Secondly they ONLY serve them in disposable plastic bowls with plastic spoons (even if you are eating in)--this is so environmentally wasteful--how can a place advocating healthy living happily contribute to unnecessary use of disposable plastic?? Thirdly, they don't provide drinking water--if fact you can't even buy water...only expensive juices. I have a real issue with restaurants in a tropical country refusing to serve water especially when the food is expensive. And again...how is this healthy? I think Project Acai is a superficial business cashing in on a food trend but they really don't practice what they preach

Visited the outlet in Orchard this week for the first time and opted for a medium size serving of a√ßai with fruit salad. All quite tasty although I didn't really notice any sudden benefit accruing to me as a result of eating it. Maybe it's necessary to eat it repeatedly over several days

I love Aca√≠!! My friends and I always grab a quick bowl after our run or when we go shopping because, its so good!! The service is so great and they are incredibly nice. The ambiance and atmosphere is also so perfect. I love the food obviously, its so tasty and its incredibly healthy!! Definitely recommend this place if your going anywhere near Holland. The quality and the style is also beautiful

I've been passing Project Acai quite a lot and finally got to try it last week. It tasted nice but did not exceed my expectation. The portion tended to be smaller than I thought and It's quite pricey as I consider it to be an occasional food.
4
I have been visiting since November 2015 the outlet in Holland Village, and keep coming back at least once a month. Project Acai sells awesome acai bowls (authentic ones!) with fruit or nuts toppings and acai smoothies as well. the large flower acai bowl (acai base topped with fruits and seeds) costs 14.50 sgd and is quite big (enough for a lunch) and delicious

Went here with my friends after school to see what the hype was all about. The bowls are delicious, full of superfoods if you're looking for a healthy treat. I got myself the medium Original Flower Bowl ($9.30) and I really recommend it! Honestly one of the most delicious things I've eaten, although it's pretty pricy for the quantity you get.
