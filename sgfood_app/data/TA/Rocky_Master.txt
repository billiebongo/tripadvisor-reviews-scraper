I have not experienced such slow wi-fi since dial-up first came along.
I asked for an iced coffee and they only serve it black. I went for a cappuccino and it was basically hot milk with a trace of coffee.

Sept. 2017 . I have been here for a late Breakfast . I have had Coffee and Pancakes with Syrup . It was very good , I enjoied it . The Staff was friendly and the Restaurant with AC very clean .

Was surprised to find a pleasant bright cheerful spacious eatery charging reasonable prices at this neck of town. The service was warm and friendly, The Laksa was so good, I could not resist slurping down the soup too.

Whizzes in here for a quick bite to eat... had mushroom pasta, nice dish, served quickly, v garlicky!!! Well priced lunch fir a quick bite to eat...
They serve all day breakfast too...
This is a good place to visit, not amazing...but good.

Just outside Orchard Hotel one can indulge in Halaal meals or just a coffee and cake stop.
Bus stop for locals and SIA bus stop is situated right in front.
Friendly service and tasty meals.

Good location on Orchard Road, had a very enjoyable lunch after checking out of the Orchard Hotel, good service and free wifi.

When you are staying at hotels on a long trip you don't want to keep having the hotel buffet, so we had a very good smoked salmon scrambled egg and croissant, the place is clean, efficient and good food. Good for a quick bite.

We dropped into the North Bridge Rd store.
Immediately made to feel welcome.
We ordered 2 coffee and cake $22. Good value by Singapore standards.
Both coffee and cake were good, served in a timely manner with a great dose ofattitude.
Happy to return

I've been going to this restaurant for several years now and I'm positively in love with their Supreme Laksa. It's fresh and delicious, and the gravy can be slurped to the last drop. Hardly any traces of msg in it.Best of all, this restaurant is halal with friendly and efficient staff. They have several other branches in town, but the one on Orchard Road is where I'd go back again and again

Fun few days in Singapore with friends, staying at Orchard Hotel. We were hanging out for a good breakfast and coffee after a late night. Regrettably tried this place. Bad coffee! Had the All American Breakfast'. Eggs were ok. Toast was warm bread, bacon was artificial and stone cold. Sausages were pre-cooked chicken (I think??) and were also cold, don't think they even hit the fry pan! The young waitress tried her best to fix things up but the kitchen staff need to go on a cooking class
4
We tried the American breakfast which was fairly good/decent, the mushroom soup which was ok, and the chicken pot pie which was very good!! They also make a good flat white.
4
Good spot conveniently located Orchard road for breakfast, snacks and coffee. Friendly and efficient service. Value for money.
5
Super service, must try laksa, curry chicken,mango frost refreshing !!located In orchard.. Huge bfast open 7am daily
5
This was recommended by our friends from Singapore, and it came as a surprise that they did not recommend a hawker stand. The broth was creamy and with umami, you can taste the curry too. Strong flavors but, surprisingly, it hits you with subtle layers of taste. They were also very generous with the toppings--- fish balls, shrimps etc.

Had lunch with colleagues and was pleasantly surprised at Rocky Master Choice Caffe on Orchard Rd. I ordered dry mee siam on the recommendation from the staff and it was, indeed, delicious. The cafe is set up as counter service and then they bring it to you. Timing is a little off when you're eating with others who pay separately, but it wasn't off by so much that it was problematic. The cafe has a variety of dishes to please everyone. I had mee siam with tofu, and friends had a turkey club, and a pot pie. Everything was really good. Service was quick and friendly. Exactly what you want when on a lunch break.
2
Had the laksa here many times and it's been pretty good They seem to have changed the ingredients this last time. Not using Lanka noodle any more but something that looked like 3minute spaghetti. The sotong balls had chewy gritty bits in them and then to add insult to injury it wasn't hot. Might not go back for a while
4
It has been some years since we visited Singapore and we had the perception that eating places for breakfast would still be easy to find; this was not the case and the chance discovery of Rocky Master was welcomed. The cafe was in close proximity to the Orchard Parade Hotel where we were staying and we were able to get a full breakfast - scrambled eggs and coffee for $20.20(Singa) - less than half the cost of a hotel breakfast. We couldn't fault the food or the service

We were staying at Orchard Hotel. Had breakfast as part of the room upgrade. But when going down on Sunday the breakfast area was worse than Grand Central Station in NYC.Decided to get a bite to eat outside. This place was around the corner of the hotel.Two American breakfasts were ordered.40 minutes later they were ready.Sat outside but since smoking is allowed outside on the veranda and someone decided to smoke went inside. Seating was limited.Breakfast was less than so so. Coffee was horrible.McDonalds would of been better
5
On the way to the office, had quick breakfast here. Very friendly staff. Willing to help and had no problem to adapt a menu item. Ended up with a delicious fruit, cereal, yoghurt, egg and coffee breakfast. The day started perfect. Thanks to the staff and compliments to the chef
4
The best version of this restaurant is at 402 North Bridge Road just one block from the Raffles in a tidy area. We had breakfast at this restaurant most mornings because it was reasonably priced and the cafe latte was the best in the area. My scrambled eggs and toast was worth the short walk. Ask for wholemeal
3
Decent Indian and other set meals for SGD 15-20 pp available. A typical los/mid-range dining option below Delfi Orchard Mall (opposite Forum). Good for a quick, no-frills meal with good service.
4
We stopped here during a heavy morning on a recent trip to Orchard and the tea did what was required refreshed us and enabled us to move on. The service was good and the tea was very good quality, something to look forward too.
3
This is my first time to dine at this restaurant and the lunch menu was light ,healthy and with fresh ingredients.The menu is quite extensive with both asian and western sandwhiches ,pasta and dishes.
5
I recently visited Singapore and stayed at the Orchard Parade Hotel - I ventured out most mornings and had Breakfast at various Restaurants - One that comes to mind is ROCKY MASTER - Delphi Orchard. If you want quick, efficient service plus good quality food you will not be disappointed. Breakfast or Lunch.Gary

We tried their local favourite like the "Dry Mee Siam" and found it modified too much to suit the tourists, losing the authentic asian taste. The western food like tomato soup and the lasagna are okay. The prices are reasonable but they should stick to serving western food
5
As 4 adults eating and drinking differently we always have something to criticise but this place amazed us. We ended up talking about creating new recipes because of the great food we had here. I was very happy that it was so affordable compared to the other places we had been to. Service was quick and very pleasant. We will be back again today to try out other parts of the menu
4
We always eat breakfast at this restaurant when in Singapore (6 times). Toast & Jam Eggs and tea for $7.90. Price hasn't gone up in 3 years. Cheaper then our hotel.Friendly staff and meal is served quickly and hot. Free tea top up also available.Thoroughly recommend this restaurant
4
Stopped for a quick bite of lunch - didn't realize they made sandwiches to order. A "ham & cheese" was made with chicken ham and good quality cheese. Bread was lightly toasted and fresh. The lemon iced tea terrific. Caution to newbies - sandwiches are two separate pieces - enough for two people, especially the club sandwich that has 3 slices of bread. I ate there twice on the trip - both times consistently good - staff friendly. You can eat outside or in.
2
We stopped by for breakfast and it was fairly busy, but we should have been more aware because the patrons were all non-locals. The menu showed all kinds of breakfasts which sounded great and the prices were reasonable. But the service was very slow (although friendly), the food tasteless (except for the eggs) and the tea cold. The orders (ours and other tables around us) were mostly wrong on delivery, or missing something. Our guess was that there were not enough staff on duty. But in any case, we wouldn't go there nor recommend it
2
Ordered around 11:30am for two pizzas, one other in restaurant. One pizza came out in good time but for some reason the other didn't for another 20 minutes....apparently the cook couldn't cope when another person came in and ordered!Don't waste your time or money here
4
I stopped in on my way up to the Botanic Gardens. Their Asian set breakfast with coffee for $9.50 was great value. Nice little view of Orchard road if you sit outside - excellent if you like to people watch.
4
The food was all great and I personal recommend there bolognese. I absolutely love there bolognese!
My sister left her purse at the table and the waitress that was helping us ran after us for a block to give it back.
5
We stayed at Orchard hotel just around the corner and came here for Breakfast. Good value, good variety, tasted good! Would recommend.
4
The food portion is great with acceptable flavor. Really hope the cafe has Wifi to keep us there a little longer.
4
This place had a good standard of food with lots of choice. We opted for the French toast which was just what we needed for a long day of walking! A good price with a tea thrown in as well.
3
I'm always happy when I go to Rocky Master because I get great service and the staff members are really attentive. However, beyond coffee, hot chocolate (one of the best I've had in Singapore) and a few sweet offerings like cakes and pastries, the rest of the menu is pretty regular - which is not necessarily a bad thing
4
Visited Rocky Masters for lunch with a few colleagues. We place orders over the counter and they then get it to your table. We ordered a Spinach-Corn Quesadilla, Ratatouille Quesadilla, & a French Toast. The food came in at the right temperature - warm and just right to eat. The portions are well sized and reasonably priced. Service is efficient. We really enjoyed the food and would go back again
5
Popped in as was the closest restaurant to our hotel and were pleasantly surprised that it was so good. The food was fresh, hot and incredibly tasty and cheap. 2 main meals (a pizza and a pasta dish) and 2 soft drinks came to S$25. We loved the taste and were able to enjoy the Orchard Road shoppers passing by. Lovely venue with great food at great price
5
We had just got off the Hop On Hop Off bus, and we were feeling hungry,Rocky Master is at the first stop after Tanglin Road runs into Orchard Road,We decided to have Brunch and managed to get very comfortable seating at a table near the window, We were all surprised at the portion sizes as we just wanted a snack, but the food was so nice we all managed to finish our dishes and the Coffee was tasty and just the boost we needed to go back out into the heat.We didn't need lunch or afternoon tea so it was definitely worth the money.The service was pleasant and efficient
5
We were staying in a hotel close by to Rocky Master and only discovered it two days before we left Singapore which was unfortunate as the meal we had was superb so much so that we did not want to leave having met two other cruisers who although they were staying in Raffles preferred to eat there with us. Even though it was 10.00pm our waitress Anna did not hassle us to leave. We love Singapore and should we be there again - we shall return. Paul and Lorraine, Sydney, Australia

If you're not a stickler for gourmet food, this franchise works. It's a stalwart in Western and Asian cafe fare - almost any menu item will satisfy your stomach, and your sweet tooth.
Personal favourite - devil's brew latte, aglio olio and pancakes
4
Nice place for a quick breakfast with good price/value ratio. You can also sit outside and with shadow places.
4
We had a great breakfast here and thought that both the quality of the food and the value for money were both excellent.
Our hotel was right around the corner, so it was an easy walk to this venue; worth visiting.
5
we had b/fast and dinner here, it was very nice, and clean, and the price was very good.
the staff were very helpful and nice.
keep up the good work, thank you!

I used to like Rocky Master when first moving to Singapore 2 years ago, but with quality and value offer going down... no more fries with the sandwich, steep price increases etc. It's no longer an option for me.

We had breakfast here 5 mornings during our 7 day stay in Singapore. We also had dinner on our last night. We also dined here on our last visit to Singapore.Breakfast is very cheap. Bacon eggs (scrambled or fried) toast and tea for $7.90. Pancakes and full american breakfast also available as well as other selections. They also have lovely muffins and cakes to have with coffee.We also had dinner here. I had pasta and my husband had the pot pie with a free drink. Both were delicious and served quickly.Staff friendly. Restaurant is air conditioned. The restaurant/cafe was only 3 blocks from our hotel ( Peninsular Excelisor). Outside seating as well. You order at the counter and meals are delivered to your table. Thoroughly recommend this restaurant for a quick bite and it is licensed. There is also a Rocky Master on Orchard Rd which we also visited for lunch during our stay
3
Came here for a Saturday lunch. I had the BLT and she had the grilled vegetable sandwich. Both were reasonably good. The "B" wasn't pork bacon - no pork served here. We each drank Coke Lights which served in the can with a plastic glass with lots of ice - nice. You order at the counter and then they deliver to your table when it's ready
5
When in Singapore, I just wanted local food. Not my 8 year old son! He wanted pancakes. Rocky Star fulfilled both our desires. He got pancakes with butter and I had a Malay dish with eggs, dried noodles, anchovie chili sauce and greens. My wife joined us and ordered chicken mushroom crepes. All were happy with their breakfasts. Inexpensive and at the corner of Tanglin and Orchard Roads
4
If your hotel doesn't offer an affordable breakfast, then this is your go. They offer a range of breakfast sets costing around $A8, including a huge mug of coffee. The fruttoast was outstanding, two pieces of very dense toasted fruitbread which was nothing like what I buy at the local supermarket. This one is thick, packed with dried figs, almonds, apricots, raisins etc etc, and the crust covered in pinenuts. Filled me up for hours. Also lots of noodles/laksa/egg options. A great way to start the day under $A20 for the two of us
4
We ate at this restaurant 3 times for breakfast while staying at Raffles. Good size breakfast served with tea/coffee at a cheap price. Tea was in a post so you got more than one cup. Service was fast and efficient. Restaurant was clean. Was very busy every time we ate here so I think that is a sign of a good business.We were going to have an evening meal here but the restaurant was packed so we went elsewhere but would definitely try it again when in Singapore
