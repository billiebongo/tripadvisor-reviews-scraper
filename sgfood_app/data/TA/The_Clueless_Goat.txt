I go at least twice a week. Excellent coffee, quiet unassuming staff who is so dedicated to do their best. Order their scrambled eggs, salmon salad and waffles!

Prices are affordable, without GST and Tax included. The food is all pretty awesome, especially the eggs benedict brunch and truffle tator tots. It was easy to find, being near United Square Mall at Novena. Absolutely loved the experience there.

Situated in Goldhill, they served one of the best coffee in town! It offers great brunch and the owners are very hospitable. They are always crowded so prepare to wait a lil during peak hours and weekends. Always my first choice for brunch and coffee!

Good environment . peaceful crowd . nice place to hangout . didn't eat so can't review them. But latte was good.

I went and had some breakfast here. It's a great little cafe. Prices are really quite cheap and the food is great. I'd recommend the eggs benedict. The only potentially downside is that there is no wifi. That said, I do sort of like that there aren't a bunch of people working on laptops turning it into a mobile working spot, meaning that people are usually talking to each other

Labelling your menu-items with unusual names and giving your cafe an unconventional title will never make you a singular success if your wait staff continues to tell your customers off if we laugh a tad too loud or threatens to throw out a group of mums for chattering above a volume above his own level of tolerance. We booked a table in advance a day before 28th June and even warned them we had 15 chatty ladies who would be coming for a breakfast session. They agreed and took our booking.Much to our utter disgust, we were greeted with less than perfunctory courtesy (so sorry we ruined your otherwise quiet lazy morning) and a medium height fair face surly male counter staff who not only threatened to throw us out everytime we laughed or chatted a tad louder (thought that was a common occurrence at a cafe?) but also spat us a few nasty words and threw us stares as sharp as daggers - it killed our appetites.What was worse was every few minutes after he prepared snacks or drinks (without gloves) he went out to smoke his ciggies (still staring daggers at us through the glass).I felt intimidate in such a foreboding ambience.I wont bother mentioning the benedict, tatter whatchamacallit and the paltry british-my foot breakfast platter. They are not worth any mention, frankly.Female wait staff kept coming to clear up before we finished (ok....ok we shall get going before we overstay our welcome!)So, Clueless Goat, you wont be so clueless as to why you are so miserably quiet in that secluded corner with only a few sad (and quiet, yes, you'd better be QUIET!) customers after this review.Not worth a visit unless you are a sucker for surly wait staff who make you feel like you are intruding

I love to brunch at clueless goat after my yoga lessons on Sunday's there is enough choice and not too much choices. The drinks are goods, as week the dishes. Healthy and balanced tastes. I like the serving plates / cup in ceramic home made, make the food looks very authentic. The service can be slow sometimes. The place is much too noisy, need acoustic wall/ceiling as it is very resonating.

Staying in Novena we arrived at 8.55am for breakfast and lucky we were early as there was already a queue! All meals were under $10 and simply delicious. Think avocado on thick toast with poached eggs just like a good Aussie cafe. Coffee was also excellent. Excellent food and value

Tucked away next to United Square mall, this is a fantastic little brunch spot. Great coffee, and really tasty breakfast options served all day. Particular favourite is the ranchers breakfast with a side of chorizo! And don't miss the tater tots. Full english is good, but there are better, and it is cash only. Usually a queue too

The food was really good. The avocado BLT was perfect! However, I would have skipped the yoghurt, but only because it got too sweet for me with the granola (nothing bad with the taste). Very friendly staff!

Enjoy the coffee moment, enjoy the view watching how the barista prepare the coffee. Love the sweetness of the waffles.
5
If you want seriously good coffee - These guys could be in Melbourne - in the Novena area, get here and get a hit!!
5
Went looking for a good coffee in Novena and stumbled accross this small cafe. It gets a little busy and service can lag behind, but the coffee is really worth waiting for. They serve one of the best lattes in Singapore that we tried and the price (for Singapore) is reasonable.Didnt have any food but it looked pretty decent. Have been back several times and will return next time we stay in Novena

I stumbled on this place as i was wandering around, the random name got to venture inside! Nice ambience, great friendly staff and the brunch options are good, european type stuff so waffles, eggs, granola etc. I like the coffee there too which helps. They have a lovely iced lychee tea which is great if you are overheating in the singapore humidity!
4
I go there with my friend every Sunday after yoga classes. I love the food, the tea, the hot perfumed milk. Orange juice are good but a bit pricy. All other dishes have good value for money. I think the acoustic of the place is bad. It could be improved for a better comfort of the customers but is like this in 90% of restaurant in singapore. Staff is very nice and polite. Service is good too when not too too busy.

The lovely scent of freshly grounded coffee beans welcomes you the moment you stepped in. Sets the tone for the next few hours of catching up with friends over good food, great latte and delicious desserts! Highlight for me was the slice of Sticky Date Loaf. Not my usual choice of dessert but was delightfully surprised. Will be back again very soon

I found this place through a friend's recommendation. The place was packed, so had a short wait. I went with two others for brunch. Well the food is fantastic, great happy staff who obviously enjoy what they do. However, the best bit ever, the coffee, was the best. SERIOUSLY the BEST. I'd been on holiday for four weeks around the UK and Singapore and this coffee was perfect. Without wanting to sound pretentious, I should know as I have a restaurant myself. Perfectly ground beans, perfect milk. Faultless. So highly recommended. I will definitely go back here the next time I'm in Singapore

Its one of those places where if you get a seat on arrival - its great! Else be prepared to stand outside waiting for a table in the blistering humid warmth that is called weather in Singapore. Quick mental recap: 2-3 bar seats, 3 tables of 2pax, 3 tables of 4 pax & 1 share table of max 10pax. Good coffee but above average food - slow service though. Note to parents: they have a kids book area to borrow a book to entertain your kid.

Took my HD to this place for his birthday breakfast since I wanted to check it out for quite some time. It caught my fancy with its country side decor and ambience.Well, i really liked their coffee which was also expected since they market themselves as a speciality coffee shop. Along with the coffee, i equally enjoyed my breakfast: eggs with mashed avocado and salsa on a multigrain toast. The whole thing was perfect to kick start a healthy day.Talking of their ambience, the place has a cool, easy going feel around it and gives a very soft, laid back vibe- you feel like letting go and taking it easy for a while.Before I end it, i would have enjoyed a bit more had their cutlery, esp the knives been better- could see almost everyone struggling with theirs.All in all, a good option for breakfast/ coffee in novena

The coffee is actually one of the best I had in Singapore and the staff is very friendly. Remember to ask about the name of the place, it's quite interesting. Unfortunately they accept cash only.
4
Just needed a good coffee and they delivered totally. Lovely little place with friendly staff and a small but well presented menu. We just had the cakes but they were delightful. Recommend to anyone wanting a good coffee
4
Small place for 20-30 people. You might have to wait 10 minutes for a table during peak hours. Food is good but to my taste the long black is a bit too strong. Will return. Only cash payment (expect 12-18sgd per person).
5
We come here frequently. Well made coffee (sourced from Common Man), appropriately sized portions priced competitively, and cheerful staff. Competition has sprouted nearby from a chain but this owner-operated cafe remains our favourite!

Good coffee
Impressive staff
Great Vibe
Fabulous breakfast
the place has a certain vibe and the barista is good. my favorite coffee place around Novena
5
quaint little coffee shop about 6 tables almost in front of United Square in Thomson road. Very cozy industrial/cottage sort of look. Jam packed when I went there. Mixed of young professionals and businessmen gathered. Staff are so warm and accommodating.Didn't really pig out on their menu but was able to get a dose of their Toffee apple bundt, Lemon ginger mint and hazelnut cafe for only $17.

Visited Clueless Goat for the first time today, must admit they have good quality beans sourced from Common man, we had a latte and affogato made by a well-trained barista. The ambience of the cafe was fairly industrial and simple, but the coffee was good. Will return next time to try out the food and rest of the coffee products, great coffee to look forward to especially for a brunch escape

I would have commented GOOD if there is a selection. My husband had British Breakfast for $14.80 while I had waffle, eggs, ham for $9. The coffee starts from $4 for a 3 oz, like an expresso cup size so you must order the largest 7 oz that is the normal coffee cup size ar $5.50. The service is great, friendly staff but it is really a small cafe with about 10 tables or so. It is very crowded and noisy since it is small. For that price, I would still go back to my favourite Olio Dome with great ambience.No complaints, once in a while, good to have a change. Lastly, payments by cash only
5
One of the few dishes up there with the best, considering the price. We have returned many times just to have this. We hope they will never raise the price ever because that is what makes it so good. Very generous with the salmon portions, more so than we have seen anywhere else. Highly recommended

On a sunday and already there was a family waiting to enter and another entered after I placed order. Studied the menu online- thanks selfies and such - this was helpful. Tried their Avocado BLT to go. Bacon on the dry side. Came with a small side salad. Otherwise it was okay
5
The people at Clueless Goat are unfailing friendly even when they are super busy as they often are over the weekends. Their waffles are marvellous. Even my hubby has become a waffle convert. The coffee is very good too.
5
First time visiting this place. Went on the weekend visiting local coffee shops.
First impressions: Cozy, family friendly environment with a really artsy decor.
Ordered a mocha, fast efficient service and coffee was definitely 10/10
Would definitely come back!

We live in the neighborhood and when it's my wife's turn to choose, we come here for brunch. The food is great and so are the staff.
5
Has become a neighborhood breakfast institution since it's recent opening. Locals love it. Great coffee, fast consistent food, and family friendly. Wish they'd open a bit earlier on wknds though but otherwise perfect

We've ordered British Breakfast, waffles and mocha latte for brunch on a Saturday morning, impressed with the taste for all 3 dishes. Just thought the sausage and bacon was a bit oily, would be good to rest them on kitchen towels after taking out from frying pan. The other reason I rate 4/5, was because I felt the noise level inside the cafe was on the high side on a pack Saturday morning. But overall setting of the cafe was comfortable, maybe some soft materials for deco would cut down the noise echo inside this nice cafe.Well done, will return for more ;

We went to this today for late lunch. We ordered ;~ Roasted beef sandwich which was very good bread and roasted beef. The side salad was also nice. ~ Open Face Salmon Toasted was also very good in terms of quality of smoke salmon and quality of bread. We both enjoyed our meals. The coffees today are a bit better than the last visited. New barista again for today. I do missed my first review barista though. He made the best coffees for this place.
3
The staff were polite despite their young ages. Food and coffee were of reasonably good quality, but the fried egg, served together with waffles, was cold. We went on a Saturday morning so we had to wait 25 minutes for a table. The food took 30 minutes to arrive because there were 6 portions of waffles ordered before ours. Perhaps, that explained why the fried egg was cold. Overall, it is a small joint for brunch and cafe
5
We stopped by for coffee today. The cafÃ© was full so we sat outside under the fan where we were very well taken care of by the attentive and friendly staff. The coffee was excellent and teamed very well with a delicious chocolate tart on a coconut pastry. As we were leaving the owner came to ensure that everything had been ok. Well done, guys

This is a great cafe especially if you are looking for a Western breakfast that is served at 'breakfast time' rather than a brunch or worse, breakfast from midday onwards; this place opens at 8.00am, so a rare find in Singapore. The food is lovely, the cafe can be quite cosy when full of patrons as it is small but the ambiance, the service, the coffee and food offerings are all good. Nice place to sit down, chill with a friend or just check emails/etc. Nice to have on my list of good places to go

Nice little place with contemporary decor. Great coffee. But the food was disappointing. The granola and yogurt with berries had only 5 blueberries and 1 strawberry. More berries needed. And even worse the granola was purchased at Cold Storage instead of home-made. So could have done this myself at home very easy. The poached eggs and smashed avo on toast with salsa had only a single teaspoon of salsa and the "smashed avo" was more like a thin spread of green on top of the bread. Very disappointing.
