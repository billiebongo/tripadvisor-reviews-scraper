Lots of variety of food selection. Hot cooked Korean finger food as well. Great place to meet up with friends.

Nice place to discover Korean buffet. The quality of the food is nice. Service is also friendly. Price of the drinks are quite expensive. Expect to be noisy
4
Pretty good buffet where you pick your foid and grill it on your table. Good selection of different meat. Very friendly stuff. 24 S$ per perso
4
This is a non fancy Korean restaurant with a reasonable price. The spread of cook food and non cook meat choices is sufficient for us to get a good meal. There are also a few type of soup available which I particularly like the ginseng soup. Meat wise I like the pork belly and the marinated chic. The cooked chic wing is a must try too. The 2hrs time frame for 4 of us is enough time for a good meal. I would certainly go back again

After trying to source a Restaurant that had gluten free options. We found this restaurant, staff were very helpful in explaining what was gluten free and what wasn't. Best part we were able to cook our own food they we wanted. Best wishes to al

Been here a couple times and I really love the variety and quality for the price you are paying! Lots of marinated meats, good range of fresh vegetables and lots of nice cooked buffet food items too!My favorites are the chicken wings, chap chae, sweet potatos, beef ribs and spicy chicken!We like coming during dinner when there's a bigger variety of marinated meat. Staff are also super friendly and fast to help change the grill

This high ceiling and airy self serve BBQ restaurant is definitely one place to visit for the carnivores that visiting the city. Located not too far from the Orchard road strip and adjacent to the coolest looking art school, this place opens twice a day, for lunch and dinner. The servers are plenty and very helpful. The arrays of different marinated (and not marinated) meat is there to call on your inner carnivores. There are cooked and ready serve food in case cooking your own food is too excruciatingly long for you :) They also have different soups to help you down your food. Vegetables and different condiments are plenty to choose from. Ask the servers to show you how to mix spices to add taste to your bbq meat. They have juices, tea and water if purchasing alcohol is out of your budget or just not in your diet :) Perfect place to have a chat over smoldering meat with friends and family
5
The BBQ meat is nice and must try the spicy marinated chicken. But what I'm Kim different than other BBQ resto is because they serve quite lot of side dish. The side dish taste nice too! I like their coconut cassava as my dessert, yum! But I heard the q usually very long, I was lucky then because I just waited for 10 mins.
4
Heard some of friends like to visit his restaurant, so I also follow friends went to try this BBQ restaurant. It's Korean style buffet restaurant, but only can dine in about 90mins. When we had lunch there, we felt very stressful of timing. For food, not so many choices, but have my favoriate fruits, oranges and watermelons. It's cheap and just so so
3
Nothing to shout about. There are more value for money alternative around. Food and meat selection is similar to other Korean BBQ. With the exception of spring onion pancake which is quite good. While there is free flow of drinks, it is limited to fruit mixes and Korean Barley Tea. Soft drinks like Coke, spite is extra charges. Service is commendable. They clear used plates promptly without having to ask for it.
4
A fun and atmospheric venue, with a good buffet selection of items you BBQ at your table. Beer was extra but some soft drinks were included. The restaurant was very full and busy, so not ideal if you were after a romantic night out.
4
Good Selection of Meat and Appetizers! Just that the place need better ventilation instead of using fans!
5
This is truly a value for money Korean BBQ restaurant. There is also a good selection of cooked food. Highly recommended as the selection of food in the station is very good.
3
Didn't expect to see the crowds mostly youngsters age between 20s to early 30s. Buffet style to choose your meat to BBQ yourself. Slightly cheaper price compared to other korean bbq restaurants but I wasn't really enjoying becos of the smell and noise.. They have time limit of 2 hours
4
went for dinner with family total of 4 pax. $30++was given 2 hrs to eat start from sat in. food was quit fresh and full topped â†‘(as when I went to food station there we're nothing empty.) many variety. salad bar.meat bar(chickenpork.beef raw and marinated.)cooked food bar,(soup, rice boodle, chicken wing) fruit was only fresh watermelon . at cashier counter even had refreshing spray for customer to cover the smoky smell from clothes (not really help) he he. good to give a try. overall a satisfied dinning experience. a lot of young ppl sitting quit tigh. big size man sitting behind me very difficult to move in and out. only one thing. customer service need to improve. I keep clearing our table. and crews face kinda black. he he..
1
They are busy but do not alternate walk in reservation,almost 1 hour and they don't take anyone from the walk in side if they don't why have a walk in side because if you want to eat here book a reservation otherwise you will starve
3
The food marinated (Prawns, Beef, Pork, Chicken and Mutton) are right to the taste bud of our human intake. The Ginseng Chicken soup was awesome and delicious.The seats are not spacious as those who are big-sized like me will tend to open our chair wider and most of the times it will hit the person behind me.The ventilation was not good and it's better for you not to go there if you are going somewhere else after the BBQ because your clothes will smell of all the BBQ aroma and it's quite strong. Only go there in casual clothes and make that the last stop before you want to head home. Your expensive and branded bags, big wallets should stay away from there because the aroma will cling on every space of the bags and wallets for at least 2 days
4
Our group gathering was a blast as we celebrate the chinese lunar New Year with lovely chunks of sizzling meat. Portions are generous. Do note dinner service is only 2 hours. Reservations required as restaurant does not have walk-in tables towards dinner time. Overall ambience is 3 of 5 stars. Expect young crowd and teens in this joint
5
Today my team from Midiworld Music & Art School, visited I'm kim Korean bbq buffet restaurant to celebrate our music school's Christmas and festive year end get together celebration. We had a wonderful time being able to catch up with my team over a delectable hearty meal! The choice of food and selection was fabulous. The staff were friendly and provides great services to us. More importantly my colleagues told me they really enjoyed the food! I especially love the spicy chicken meat and Kim chi. It's a place I'll want to frequently visit again to dine. I give them excellent rating for my corporate dining experience. Thank you so much I'm Kim. Cheers!
4
The concept is simple and good. You can choose from different dishes at the buffet and grill at your table bbq on your own. The variety is sufficient, fresh and tasty. Staff is helpful but the prices are higher than labelled - taxes are not included yet. I would recommend to attend the lunch buffet because dinner is much more expensive and the restaurant will be overcrowded
2
We were there for the lunch buffet which is very cheap, but also very disappointing.
The atmosphere is not nice either. Skip this.
4
Nice place, delicious food, good service, but only 1 hour and 30 minute to eat there. Definitely will recommend to my friends.
3
Tucked away on the side beside Rendesvous Hotel on the SOTA campus, is this restaurant. I went there with three of my other friends (4 people in total, for those mathematically challenged, aka, me). We arrived there on a Saturday evening, right before they opened for the dinner crowd. Staff at the door, well, I guess they had to get through the crowd forming, so they were a bit abrupt, but the service inside differs. Staff were friendly, to the point where they wanted to change my tables grill, frequently. Not that I had a problem with that, except, another staff had changed it, barely a minute before the other staff arrived. when they give you a two hour time limit to eat, you think, "Nah, who needs two hours? Like seriously, I could be done in an hour or less"NO!!! Two hours is about right. If you have a small group, like mine. We had two minutes to spare. If you have a big group, well, I wouldnt know how to manage. If you are a KPOP fan, music videos play on a few of the TV screens, littered around the restaurant. Don't ask me if they are the latest hits though. For the bbq/grill table side, four is probably the max amount of people you would want at a table. Its small and everyone is fighting for grill space, unless you are all saints, and are willing to share the space, then it wouldnt be a problem. The cuts of meat, especially the beef, is huge. (PS: Thank god they had scissors at each table to cut the meat) Also to cook the meat, the corner of the grills are useless. But if you are fighting for space with your friends, then, prepare for a bloody long wait, cause you could probably put your hand on that corner, and not get burned. I didn't try it though. I'm not THAT dumb.On to the food, finally. For the already cooked food, they had quite a few selections. KFC (Korean Fried Chicken, which was my fave), some glass noodles (which I could not have enough off), Soups, Rice, Salad (Bleurgh!), Baby squid, etc. Standard Korean buffet fare with condiments.As for the meats, if you eat pork, then there is more than enough selection for you to be in heaven. If like me, you dont eat pork, there was 4 beef selection with a measly 2 chicken selection. I suggest going for the beef. Its marinated well, and once its grilled, even if you grilled it like ten minutes ago, it still is soft and tender. Check out the marinated meat selections on their facebook page, for their list of items.Would I go again.... Probably. The price was reasonable. Food was good, not great, but just plain good
5
This place is the place for authentic Korean BBQ as the spread of the meat buffet, is simple amazing! There are also children friendly food that they have catered for and your kids would be having an excellent choice of food and sweet stuff!The staff are also friendly and I was honored and blessed to have both sisters, Su Lim and Elim present. They served us and ensure that we are comfortable. They even took a picture with us all
3
Visited the restaurant alone last month on a weekday afternoon. Excellent chicken soup offered. However, atmosphere and service was not up to expectations. It may be better for single diner to be seated at a middle of the restaurant but was allocated a table near the kitchen. May visit the restaurant with promotions next time
2
The one thing we didn't like about the restaurant was the bad interior layout. They placed all the food stations along the wall at one end of the restaurant instead of at the center. Every time we went for food, we had to take a long and winding walk. It felt like navigating a maze because of the way the tables were arranged. The furnitures are black in colour, making the place look dark and comfortable - an uninteresting place to eat.The waiter who served us couldn't understand simple English. As it was my first time there, I asked whether the concept was a free-flow or semi buffet style. But he kept telling me that the max. time I could stay was up to 3pm. Come on, I was asking about the buffet style, not until what time I could eat there. Simple question yet he couldn't understand!Food was so so only. The kimchi was really spicy. Juices were free-flow but soft drinks like Coke and Sprite were chargeable.There are many other Korean BBQ buffet restaurants that offer more delicious food and comfortable dining experience. So I am not going back there to eat again. I also learned a lesson. Never trust food bloggers' review
3
Lots of meat on offer. Prawns not nice. Good just average, beer over the top expensive $19++. If you are hungry the opportunity to eat a lot of food is there for you
4
Was there for lunch and it was packed full of customers that lines were forming outside. The staff did a great job in handling the customers waiting in-line professionally with constant updates on the duration they would have to wait to be seated as well as getting customers seated as soon as a seat is available. Food spread was also pretty decent with lots to choose from and the on-floor staff were also very attentive and patient with customer's requests even with the overwhelming crowd. Service provided is really good and I had a really great experience there
5
Visiting almost every month.. at least one time a month.. cozy and friendly environment. A good place to arrange an outing with friends and family. Cut your meat into smaller piece eat it with a small piece of fresh onion... the best taste... yummy... Reasonable price... friendly staffs.. never fail to give me and my family and warm welcome whenever we visit.... The boss should be proud with the operation team...
4
overall its quite cheap to eat here, the food is ok, you get to find marinated garlic chicken, spicy chicken, pork belly, marinated beef. It's quite satisfactory if you havnt eaten korean bbq for awhile. staff there is pleasant. however there can be much improvement at the joint, firstly is to have a template on teaching people eating at a korean bbq joint how to utilize their assorted ingredients, as most people doesnt know how to dine with them. overall, if you are a student, go during lunch hours to get their discount price at $15.20. It's a decent price for decent food, although this place doesnt leave a lasting impression, it does have any areas to complain for as well.
4
Great food, salsbury steak was fantastic, pork wings were the best. My friends and I put too much meat in our mouth, super full and have the meat sweats. It was worth it though.
5
The glaze on the barbecue pork wings was phenomenal! It was a mouthwatering sensation, glad I was able to share it with my five friends from out of town, coming all the way from woodlands.
4
I hadn't tried Korean food before, and certainly not this dish - it sounded so out of this world?! But it really works - and boy does I Am Kim nail this dish. How do I book for tomorrow, lol !!!
5
I came here in April, we were seated very quickly. And served our drinks quickly too. It's a help your self buffet and then you cook your meat using the BBQ on the table. Very good and different. Price wise it's very cheap too!
3
Value for money if you like BBQ buffet.
Place is pretty congested when it's full. Spread is good !!!
You do smell of BBQ when you exit.
3
I'd say it's a great place to gather with big group of friends over a variety selections of BBQ or cooked food, but not so much on the quality for the price you pay. Overall average.
4
My older son and I went here for our first Korean BBQ... It was very enjoyable, friendly and helpful staff, nice selection of things to BBQ (buffet style...)
Will go again the next time I'm in Singapore
5
Had a chance to visit I am Kim Korean BBq here in Singapore and i must admit,it was truly a tasteful and full stomach experience we had.It was Mother's day then and the venue is really jam packed!Food is really delicious and the staff is very Friendly.I was'nt able to get the name of a Filipino staff (the tallest crew i think) there which is really smart,got a Big SmILE in his face,and very helpful...You will really want to try their food.Awesome experience and definitely will come back again to this place!Kudos everyone
3
Situated at town, I think I'm Kim offers an unbeatable price for its buffet lunch and dinner. Good selection of items on the buffet line for both bbq n cooked items. There are also desserts available at additional prices such as bingsu and ice cream..Clearly ideal for big groups and loud conversations. The staff will also go around tables with dialogue props for photo taking.. Will be back!
3
The range of choice of raw meat was okey. Free drinks was available. But the options on ready to eat food, and sauces was too limited, and nobody come to change the fry pan when it became fully pasted with burned grease. Given the price of lunch on weekdays, I should have no complaints though
5
Friendly and responsive staff, food is extremely affordable esp for students at lunch time. Lots of meat provided although the variety can be extended. Overall a good place to have kbbq with friends. As Long as you can shout over each other.
5
I went there with my friend and almost everything are delicious!! Variety options for the meat, if you are the meat lover then you must try.
4
Had a lovely quiet lunch on a very, very hot day. Inside was nice and cool. Went for the high end meat on the grill, was pricey both worth every wonderful bite.
4
Great for the meat eaters. Good value and a bit of fun cooking at your table. Plenty of variety.....
5
Walking around town amd chance upon this bbq. Service is very good, reason being they change my bbq metal plate thing every time it was burnt, and without asking.I have been to many korean bbq, some would say its still useable, some change only once per session. I am kim changes every now and then, fantastic
4
When i need a protein spike, i go here. The marinated chicken trumps the beef and pork. The beef and pork can be a bit chewy. Pricing is fair for a buffet. Suggest you don't visit in you best clothes, as you'll come out smelling like a bbq plate
5
I made hubby queue to get a table. He was not happy about that. However when he discovered they served large bottles of beer he calmed down a little.It is buffet style: you go and pick your raw meat and accompaniments the go back to your table and cook it.The choice of meat was astounding and the quality was the best we have had in Singapore.This is not the place for the shy or faint hearted. It is like being at home with family where you don't care how you eat or how messy you get.Hubby and I are both big but we were amateurs compared to the local families who it seemed were all set on eating their own weight in meat. . . . and succeeding too.A fun place to eat and an experience too
3
This is my 2nd visit to I'm Kim's in less than 2 months. Came to give my freelance staff a treat. Praises to the quality cuts of meats and vegetables. Even the free flow drinks are nice. Our buffet was to end at 9pm. Now, this is a BBQ place. Why did you have to switch off all your ceiling fans at 8.47pm? An enjoyable evening was ruined by your poor business tactic. I think most diners came in at 7-7.30pm and you have a time limit for diners and you decided to turn off the fans to make us uncomfortable and leave sooner? It became hot and sweaty and it did not help that the PSI level outside was very healthy levels, due to the Indonesian haze? Your restaurant is not properly ventilated for a BBQ place and you turn off your ceiling fans? Is this how you treat your customers? If you turn off your ceiling fans at 9.30pm or 9.45pm, I would understand that you need to go home.I am writing this review for your sake. so that you do not try to lose customers
5
Now I'm not a food critique but I have to say that this food was by far the most exciting, interactive, delicious meal I have ever had!! 10/10 would recommend to friends and family and will definitely be going back myself on my next Singapore trip !!
3
One word for service: Horrible! When we ask for our bday ice cream, the staff shows us a doubting face and says there's no free icecream for bday girl but when my friend made the reservation, she confirmed twice with the staff there. A bald tall guy came and ask for our concern. And he is horrible. Demand for our ID, we know its for verification but mind your tone of speech when we're the customer. After verifying, he proceed to give us the ice cream we bday girls deserved. Come on, its not the free ice cream that we crave for but the promises you gave your customers. Once and that's it. I may very well wont go there anymore till they improve on their staff service
5
Spicy chicken was super good!! The price was very affordable! But their food quality was not compromised.
Would recommend this place :)
5
Memories of South Korea's BBQ rekindled; fresh meat and seafood for you to hands on the way you like it. The buffet is value for money. Staff were friendly and attended to us efficiently. Thumbs up!
5
Good food, variety, interesting soup choices, warm cooked food, free flow drinks of different types. Improve: better air con, less oily floor.

Love Korean BBQ so headed down to I'm Kim Korean BBQ. It's housed in the SOTA building on the ground floor just as you round the corner onto Selegie Road. If you're driving park in the building next door as there is no carpark in SOTA and that area's just totally congested. Another piece of advice with regards to most popular restaurants in Singapore, book a table because you won't get one if you are a walk-in. I thought this restaurant would cooler with "I AM KIM" rather than the "I'M KIM", but the rest of dining experience is fabulous. It's pretty basic but for the price, it's excellent value lunch or dinner. Hot and smokey, just fire up your table grill and lay some meat on the grill, tuck in and enjoy. There's a huge long table where you can help yourself to a wide variety of meats of different cuts in different sauces, rice (I don't waste stomach space on starch at a buffet!!) I highly recommend the belly pork and any meat in bulgogi sauce. Simply delicious. The Korean powdered chili and BBQ sauce are delightful dressings for the meat. There are cold cordials on tap, and a table of desserts to top off a great meal. Don't expect much service as it is very busy and mainly a DIY place (once you get your table you're really on your own-after all you're cooking at your table). If you want a good budget Korean BBQ meal then I'm Kim is the place to go
1
At 500pm we show up me and my wife who is Asian and the door man says to me were full and must wait an hour and half. I say theirs not many people or hardly any people their inside and then he shows me the wait list and first reservations are at 600pm and he tells me I should have made reservation if I want to eat here because we are pack now. I said are you joking with me and he said you do not understand you have to wait an hour or maybe two hours now if you really want to eat here. Then my surprise 5 people showed up and get asked the same questions if had reservations and they said no and they let them eat. I asked what is up with that and he said you must wait. Being a not happy camper now and said this was "not right" and left. Pretty much sure he did not want a foreigner to eat here and he was not even the manager. What I do not understand this was a Korean Eatery and who cares who eats here and then we walked passed at it at 630pm and still was hardly no one was eating here. This place has very bad service representation issues that I notice to a foreigner !! Very disappointed and hopefully management will do something about their front door men who do not let certain people in. This Eating Restaurant should know better and it is not no suite fancy place either!

Get to try out this korean bbq buffet and well the money is well spend with great varieties of meat and cooked food. The place is filled with many people, the staff mostly are friendly and clear the empty plates quite fast. Out of the meat, the best is the garlic chicken, they marinated the meat well and it does not tasted salty. Cooked food wise it also offered quite a selection, price is affordable thus it is highly recommended to try at least once, the restaurant is located just beside Cathay and selegie so it is very easy to find
3
I went to this restaurant for dinner tonight after I saw from tripadvisory good review s and all. When I reached the restaurant, I immediately went to the prepared cooked food. Hmm not much choices though. Korean fried chicken is cold, fish fillet is so so. Not much selection of fruits ( only watermelon) and vegetables. Marinated meat are not bad. Mushroom soup is nice and lime juice is good.Overall, I won't recommend this. There are many other restaurants in bugis and tanjong pagar more worth it.I paid abot $20.9 per person after $2 discount using ocbc cc
4
I'm Kim is a super-sized buffet dining hall with bbq grills on every table. The marinated meats are laid out at the buffet counter. You can select your choice of meat or seafood and grill it at your table. Take your pick from a good variety of accompaniments and sauces to go with the meats. The Spicy Pork Collar was great and so was the sliced beef which was marinated in a light sauce. A very simple restaurant, offering a great dining experience and definitely value for money, considering all you can tuck in
5
Have been several times and love the food - there is a wide range of meat and side dishes. The marinade for the meat is delicious! Lots of veg and various soft drinks. Staff are very helpful and friendly.A great place to feast with family and friends. Excellent value for money as it's a buffet
4
What's there not to like about AYCE korean bbq? I would say this establishment is right on par with many of the delicious KBBQs you will find in Southern California. In fact, I believe I had one of the largest slice of kalbi ribs I've ever seen. Conveniently located close to Dhoby Ghaut MRT station and a bunch of bus lines stop right in front. Be warned there's going to be a line getting in on weekends and holidays. Lunch is slightly less expensive but you won't find any kalbi ribs or prawns. Friendly staff and quick service. Grills are changed often only during lunch and rarely during the busy dinner seatings. Free flowing juices, soba-cha, and sikhye included with the meals
5
Food good! Staffs are nice n helpful. A must go place for party n meals. A good place for Korean BBQ. Reasonable price too.
5
The food was fantastic. you get to cook your Neal the way you want. excelent price for buffet. very good flavor ......
4
Loved the loads of meat, fish, mushrooms, sauces and green tea... But most of al the Koreanfood experience. Never had it before.
You sit at a table in which a BBQ is planted. :)
Interesting fact: people even que for this place!
4
Walked past a few times and finally got to try it! It's really value for money. They have wide range of cooked food and well marinated meat. I love their volcano chicken!
5
Had our department lunch of 25 pax at I'm Kim Korean BBQ before heading to LKY Exhibition at National Museum.Reservation Q and Walk in Q very well defined so that it does not confused personnel who had reserved.Lunch buffet station is with wide variety. Hot food like pasta, kim chi fried rice, nuggets and popcorn chicken (my personal favourite) are available while we wait for our beefs chicken and others being cooked on BBQ.Free flow drinks are mixed v.well. My Personal favourite is Mango Juice. Just nice sweetness. Wide variety too! About 4 drink dispenser if I could remember!Overall a good place to have your lunch. Cheap and affordable if you are nearby this area! :
5
Came with my family many times and decided to write a review on the food.Firstly, the staff are very friendly and they are there to assist you.There are many cooked dishes and the fried chicken wings are the best. Well cooked and tasted fantastic. Simply a must try when you are in the restaurant.They have many raw meats and the one that I love best is the beef short rib. The meat is tender and well marinated.The Kimchi and the lettuce, with radish went well with the cooked meat when you wrapped them up. Don't forget the garlic and the sauce. One bit of the combination and you will ask for more.Overall experience. Fantastic and many times, I dream of going there except that I need to exercise after the heavy meal to burn off the calories.Value for money and fresh food
5
I've been living here a month now and have already come to I'm Kim 3 times. The atmosphere is awesome: energetic, clean and friendly. K Pop music videos play on the TV's and the friendly staff is always walking around to clean the table or help you with anything you need. On top of the great service the food is delicious. Great options of meat that have tons of flavor. My favorite is easily the volcano chicken. So moist and delicious even if you're a crappy cook on the table grill. I would definitely recommend coming here to anyone who is in town- great people, great food and great atmosphere. You can't beat it. I'll be back next week
5
A must-visit when u are in Singapore! Yummy Korean BBQ food! Their signature volcano chicken is truly heavenly! I enjoyed tremendously the bacon rolled with the enoki mushroom... I think when I back Taiwan I will be dreaming of the food. Hope they would open a restaurant in Taiwan soon..
5
Food was great with a wide variety to choose from. Always my choice of comfort food! The meat was well marinated and very delicious. Also, great customer service was demonstrated. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I was very impressed when they took the initiative to change the grill for us. Love the music and mvs that were played
4
I'm really fond of Korean food, I especially enjoy Korean BBQs, where you get to cook your food at your table. Service was top notch, friendly staff showed us to our seats promptly. We ordered some drinks, and nice that we were able to get souchu and makkoli, the Korean rice wine.On to the food. There's a whole section of starters like sushi rolls, salads and of course kim chi. Lots of sliced beef and pork, marinated chicken including an intriguing one called volcano chicken. Must try this one...spicy but oh so nice. There's also an interesting version of chicken wings, already cooked, crispy and a super-secret sauce. Don't miss these...and I think it's Elim's (one of the owners) favourites. Lots of fresh lettuce leaves to wrap up the meat, good salads available, and help yourself to unlimited soft drinks. The BBQ hotplate was changed regularly, and all up, the food and service were really good.At one point, one of the staff came around with little signs, which we were able to use while getting our pictures taken. I found out that these get posted in the local Facebook page http://on.fb.me/1x6wTt4Their weekday lunch buffet starts at SGD$14 and weekend dinner at SGD$24, so not bad on the budget.They even made it to the top 10 Korean BBQ restaurants in Singapore http://sethlui.com/best-korean-bbq-singapore/Note, despite the address, I'M Kim actually fronts on to Prinsep Street, at the School of the Arts. Nearest MRT is Dhoby Ghaut.I hope you'll enjoy the place. Worth a few visits
5
Must be one of the best kbbq i have ever tried for its really reasonable pricing! They have a variety of food from japanese to westerns to korean! Free flow drinks and even ice cream at the end going off at one dollar! Worth!
5
This is indeed the rare few restaurants that offer such quality meat & widespread selection for the price. The ready made selection is also very well done for a buffer restaurant. Crowded though, so need to go early!
4
Very convenient location at SOTA. Easy to find as well as the storefront is very prominent. Staff was friendly and food was quickly replenished when run out. Liked the variety of cooked and non-cooked food. Overall yummy!
5
Where there are any good restaurants that serve good, yummy authentic Korean food at affordable prices, THIS is the one!
5
For our group gathering once a year, I'M Kim was chosen because of convenience Orchard Road vicinity and the recent buzz for its value-for-money buffet. Though we have a later reservation time, my wife and myself was ushered-in earlier despite of a full house. We felt comfortable with the warm reception, no rush to order and even offered a drink while we waited for the rest. One of our group member has special needs. The staff ensured that she is in a secured seat and not too much of a hassle on her movement. Appreciate the consideration.Great for group gathering and service with heart
5
Well marinated food and good quality meat makes delicious BBQ. Surprised that they can sustain such quality with affordable pricing. Equally attractive are the large and wide selection from the buffet spread. The restaurant is well air-con and ventilated to make a comfortable dining experience. Owner must have put a lot of thoughts and investment. Great place and I will be back very soon
5
Was greeted by a cute and handsome mascot outside holding a cleaver and the bright lights illuminating this place makes it hard to miss.Buffet lunch starts from as low as $14++ on weekdays which is really very affordable given the large variety of food available here.Cooked food was aplenty and must try their volcano chicken which is spicy but delectable.Full review with pictures here: http://ilovedawn00.blogspot.sg/2015/01/food-review-im-kim-korean-bbq.htm
5
Walked past it so many times before and should have gone here earlier! All you can eat Korean BBQ at a reasonable price right across from the hotel we were staying in. Needless to say we tried many different dishes and filled ourselves to the brim! Just be mindful that any wastage is charged to your bill, which is a fair way to curb senseless waste.
4
We found this little restaurant in the same building as the 3 Petits Croissants CafÃ©, and also very good value. Both are a budget traveller and students paradise. Excellent food at a cheap price.Clean and friendly. On ground floor of the Singapore School of the Arts (SOTA) building, across the round from the Rendezvous Hotel. They have daily specials

This is one of the cheapest korean BBQ at orchard area. At the price of $14.90++ for weekdays lunch, you could enjoy a decent korean BBQ buffet. If you have a OCBC credit card, the price would be $12.90++ instead. Children under 5 is FOC. There are few types of meat, but vocalno chicken and the pork belly seems to be the popular one. Would like also to mentioned about the kimchi fried rice and kimchi soup, these are my favorite too. So there are total 3 main corner - meat, cooked food and salad bar. The staff is friendly and you can notice 80% of their customers are youth/ students (student price is $12.90 for weekdays lunch too). As other BBQ restaurant, you will be having the smell of meat on your shirt and hair after the meal :-)I did enjoy my meal there on a weekday/ rainny afternoon. Do prepare to come early as the queue is lon

The main reason for dropping by this restaurant is their special package for lunch during weekends. The food had many choices to select and the staffs shows their generous and politeness to customers for their needs.

Value for the money. There's different type of meat available and the best of all is probably the volcano chicken! Spicy but nice! Staffs are friendly too! They would suggest which sauce to go with the food as well. Price is reasonable too. Probably one of the better choices for affordable koreAn bbq! :

I'm Kim Korean BBQ Buffet has just opened at SOTA for a few months, but it has already earned the loyalty of many customers as It is one of the most affordable Korean BBQ buffet restaurants in Singapore. It has a decent buffet spread and you can get a good spread of marinated meat and seafood. What attracted me more was their cooked food on the sides. From fried chicken wings, Spring Rolls, Stir Fried Fish, Japchae Glass Noodles, Rice Cake Deokbokgee, sweet potatoes etc etc...You'll be spoilt for choices! there's also a soup and salad section and you've got to try their kimchi soup. it is so unique and flavorful that I had 3 servings! I will definitely be their regular customer from now on! Kudos to I'M KIM

Had a mini birthday celebration in this newly open bbq buffet restaurant located at SOTA. The restaurant is rather spacious, nice vibe and cosy The central venue near Dhoby Ghaut MRT is perfect for gatherings with friends and loves one. We had their weekday buffet dinner which is around $22++ per adult. The waitress here are polite and friendly If you are a meat lover mlike me, this will be THE PERFECT PLACE for you! There's a huge variety of meats that will put a smile on your face and They are pretty generous with their portions! We had quite a lot of their thinly sliced pork belly, which are really fresh and chewy. A heavenly combination when you dip the barbequed meat in the flavourful chilli sauce wrapped in crunchy cabbage! The food here is really great. You can see happy customers around laughing and taking photographs. Value for money

Of all the places I have been for Korean BBQ, I have to say I am KIM Korean BBQ is one of the places with affordable prices and a wide array of food choices. If you are planning a gathering with friends or celebrating a birthday for a family member, be sure to drop by this place for a great time of feasting

Food is soooo good! I love the meat... beef roll, ribs and bacon! The pickle, lettuce (so fresh), golden mushroom taste so good together with the meat!I have been there a few times and never get tired of it. The staff are really friendly and polite... would come to remind me the food is closing so that I can get more helpings! Wow, a buffet place that encourages you to get MORE food?I had some vouchers for discounted prices, and I thought I had to give like one voucher for EACH PERSON at the table but they only requested/needed ONE voucher for ONE TABLE (regardless of how many persons at that table). Genuine and Generous people! Really value for money... Thanks I'm Kim

Staff were efficient in clearing plates, place had simple decoration and furniture. There were quite a few meat choices available such as garlic chicken, volcano chicken, pork collar, beef etc. Vegetables included enoki mushroom, onions, garlic, lettuce. Drinks selection was quite good with 4 types of choices and it was free flow. The food was yummy and the design of the hot plate was good as the oil all flowed downwards into the container below so it was soaked in oil while cooking. Excellent food and service! Especially for the student price or OCBC card price. Will return soon

Saw their facebook promo. I enquired if promo valid on weekends. Reply says look forward to seeing me. When I asked again, they said promo only valid on weekdays. They have SO MUCH INTEGRITY and are SO HONEST doing business. Can't imagine what if I had visited them and they insisted I pay full price on weekends. Patronise at your own risk
