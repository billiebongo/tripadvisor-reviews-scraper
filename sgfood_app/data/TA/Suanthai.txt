Got introduced by a friend and immediately fell in love with all of the food they got to offer. Service was excellent.
4
The food was very good, as was the service. The prices seemed a bit higher than other restaurants in the area, but the atmosphere was also much nicer than the surrounding restaurants. All in all good food at a nice place.
3
Popped in here for lunch today and opted for a mango salad, a green curry and some Pad Thai. All quite decent, although perhaps a little oily for the Pad Thai. Havig to pay extra for water was a bit annoying.
3
Non descript dÃ©cor. The menu is standard Thai fare, with no innovative signature dish. The chilli dip for the BBQ squid is fiery, but the sauce for the steamed sea bass with lime and chilli is quite bland. Serving Indian papadum with Thai curry is bizarre! Enthusiastic and friendly staff, otherwise this is a below-average Thai experience.
3
Had a dinner here in early July. Although many of the restaurants on the same street were fully packed, there were still some empty tables here. So we went in.The service was fluent and friendly all the way from the first hello till the final goodbye. The food was OK, nothing special but nothing to complain either. Maybe the price level is slightly higher than in the neighbourhood in overall.If you want to have thai food in the Killiney road, this maybe your choice. If you are not limited to the area, then browse for other options as well

The food was simply delicious. Some of the finest Thai food I have ever eaten in my life. It was simply delicious. I'd recommend the Tom Yam Soup and one of the red or green curries. I go here extremely often ever since the first time I've eaten at this place a few years ago and they only keep improving. As a connoisseur, if you want good Thai food, this is the definitely the place to go. The food is simply too amazing. I also love the fact that they have a vegetarian menu separate from the actual menu itself. So if you're a vegan or a vegetarian, this restaurant is perfect for you
4
Jumped here for a quick lunch. The service was fast I get the food within couple of minutes. Comparing with other Thai experience I was very satisfied with the result. The soup was huge and really tasty. Not so creamy like in Europe but the taste was better. The curry with little chili oil was also perfect journey of the Thai culinary world
3
Strange that they charged extra for the hand towels. Warning - 10% service and 7% GST are added to the bill. Very little vegetarian choice. Thai red curry was good . The price was reasonable but it worked out 4 times as expensive as the more basic places nearby.Food was nice for a change and it was good to be inside in an air-conditioned atmosphere, but we went back to hawker centre type food the next night
4
Went here after getting into Singapore after too many hours of airline food. The service was brisk, efficient and very friendly. The food we ordered was very tasty and well cooked, and all at a very reasonable price. If you like Thai food, then this place should be on your list
4
We bought 8 Streetdeal vouchers for the lunch buffet. (look out for add ons eg. service charge and GST and drinks not included). I thought I just list the yumz dishes.The food was actually great. Favourite dishes: tom yum kung (prawn) soup, green mango and papaya salads were great and very generous servings. pandan chicken!, chicken satay, Thai fish cake, deep fried fish with thai sauce and tapioca and red ruby. I thought the soup was great but did not look appetising as it was just a clear soup with 2 prawns and a mushroom - literally. We also had the beef and green curry (vegetable) and white fungus salad and many more. But the food was mediocre. Honestly I expected more from the Thai restaurant
4
The resturant is close to the hotel I stayed, just five minutes walk, Homely felt in stay there whilst the price is reasonable.
4
I was introduced to this place by a very good friend. Great meal! Though it's very busy during luch time but the staff always try to be attentive at their best level.
3
First visit, food was quite ok but the service was not up to the standards. 2 different menus for lunch buffet and it is really confusing. Dessert counter was terrible. The service staff was rude and no one smile at all.
5
This restaurant is 20 metres from where we are stayingWhat alovely meal and great service and prices.recommend the Mango fish.overall very enjoyable meal.
4
Visited Suan Thai after 6 months. Glad that the food standard holds. We ordered a papaya salad, green curry and beef with basil and chillies. The salad and green curry were excellent. Their service though is a bit patchy. I would also wish that they would simplify their menu and not charge for water.
2
This literally used to be my favourite thai restaurant in town, for the past 5 years. However, after the last 3 visits, I feel as though the standards have dropped and the staff are quite indifferent, with the manager being borderline rude - on numerous occasions. Maybe, the loyalty of the patrons and the success of the restaurant have made them grossly complacent. The quality of food and the ingredients have also become sub-par. It's also not that cheap for dinner, and with the number of authentic thai restaurants opening up, I would rather take my business elsewhere. I doubt my business would be missed. It's a shame and a pity.I'm definitely not going to be coming here again anytime soon

wanted to be upfront that piece is not from a dine in experience but one which we caters from the restaurant. we ordered the following:mini fried poh piahpineapple ricethai vermicelligreen curry chickenbeef with cashew nutskai lanfried fish slicesred ruby ice shavingsfor me the dessert was the best. the rest catered 2 large cooler box of shaved iceto top up on the red rubbbies in milk..super...just like the way its eaten in the restaurant. the rest of the food spread was ok as my church mates and visitors chomped their way thru - it must be good. cheers to my pastor decided to try out the restaurant caterer. we can consider visiting the restaurant itself in the future
5
Sometimes you can over complicate things and expect too much from food in Singapore. This restaurant is a straightforward great family Thai place and you cannot ask for better than that! Great green curry, pad thai, good deals for lunch. You won't be disappointed. Unlike the previous report we also found the staff very nice

My family of 9 went for an ala-carte thai buffet dinner on Saturday. The ambience was homely which made us feel at ease. The service was decent. The food was consistently fresh and good. As for the price, the management should consider providing free drinks. We paid $17 per head without drinks and had to order separately. Adding on was 10% service, 7% GST. Was that because we booked through deal.com? I would suggest that they should charge about $25 per head inclusive of free flow drinks and taxes other than dodgy charges. Besides that, we enjoyed the dishes. The mango salad, the stuffed chicken wings, thai style chicken satay, deep fried fish fillet with sweet sour and spicy sauce were all excellent. Not forgetting the tom yam soup was yummy. As for dessert, very limited. Would come back and hope to see some changes on the price...
4
It's by far most that was worth the $ to pay for a authentic Thai lunch. The ambience was homely-based which made us feel very at ease. Both my husband and i would really recommend this place even if you like to have a quick lunch as they are efficient and not cutting ends. Love it
5
Fantastic food, value for money. We live in Singapore and frequent suanthai more than any other restaurant.
They also have numerous vegetarian options - ask for the veggie menu.
Love their olive rice!!!
4
Good Thai food with decent vegetarian options.
They have a full page of vegetarian dishes to choose from.
Reasonably priced, each dish priced around SGD 10.
Easy to find as it is on the main road itself.
5
Their combos have great variety, quantity and taste...therefore are of great value.During our stay we tried a lot of combos and loved them all. One of those can't go wrong kind of places I felt.Also, the service was quite personalised. One time when we went to pick up a pre-ordered takeaway, the restaurant had just closed and the staff were having their lunch but still readily gave us our parcel and wished us cheerfully on our way out as well.Kudos to the Suanthai team!

Suanthai food is simple traditional Thai fare and immediately transported me back to Chang Mai, Phuket and Bangkok. The green curry chicken was richly layered, complex and delicious, We also ordered mixed platter of appetisers mango salad, barbequed squid, kang kong, fried fish with spicy &sour sauce & steamed rice, all delicious.If you are a fan of Thai, Suanthai should be on your must try list. This is simple restaurant that serves fairly good Thai food. Nice simple decor, polite & prompt service. Thank you for more than a touch of stylish Thai hospitality in Singapore

I had dinner here on my first night in Singapore as it was close to my hotel and I had spent the whole day travelling. The food was delicious, reasonably priced and came quickly! I had the red curry which was tasty, filling and perfect after a long day of travelling
4
Went here with two friends for dinner and we enjoyed ourselves. They do add a 10% service charge as well as gst to prices listed on the menu - not a huge deal but something to keep in mind. They will also charge you less than S$0.50 for wet tissues that are provided - if you don't use them give them back to the waitstaff and they will remove it from the bill. The food was quite tasty - we ordered the Gaeng ped gai/nuer (Thai red curry), Tom yam goong (sour/spicy soup), Pad Thai (peanut noodles), and Pad prik kieng 'long beans.' The Pad Thai was decent, tasted a little on the catsup-y side for me, but my friend enjoyed it quite a bit. The red curry was amazing, as were the long beans. Tom Yam soup was good - but no one in our group was particularly fond of sour/spicy soups so I don't think we're the best to judge its quality. We also ordered a mango w/sticky rice for dessert which was good too

CRAP. Crap food. Crap service. Crap "ambience". CRAP, CRAP, CRAP. We got here at 2.20pm today and were rushed to order because the kitchen was closing at 2.30. Ok fine, I understand. But what they didn't tell us was that the restaurant itself closed at 3pm. At 2.45, 2.50 and 3pm, we were rudely told thrice by the extremely unpleasant head waitress that we should eat quickly and get out soon. They even switched the restaurant lights off at 3pm. Never coming back here for the oily, greasy food and lousy lousy service again
3
An average Thai restaurant, food tastes okey, and service was not bad. Table cloth seems a bit dirty. Generally speaking, it is okey given the price of food. They charge for their wet tissues, though only $0.35 each. It was small money but would be better if they let people know in advance
4
Located along a row of shophouses opposite the SingTel building, this restaurant was not difficult to find.The reasonably priced menu and homely ambience complimented each other. The menu had the usual dishes found in most Thai restaurants. We ordered the fish cake (two huge chewy and tasty pieces of fish patties cooked just right), chicken with cashew nuts (bite-sized chicken pieces stir-fried with crunchy nuts) and the mango salad (slices of sweet mango tossed together with dried shrimps and cashew nuts). To end the meal on a sweet note, dessert came in the form of red-colored chestnuts drenched in coconut milk and durian paste; both very generous in servings.Service was quick with no frills but it would have been nice to have some staff-to-guest interaction...just a thought
3
This is simple restaurant that serves fairly good Thai food.Nice simple decor, polite & prompt service.Our party of four ordered mango salad, a mixed platter of appetisers, barbequed squid,kangkong,green curry chicken, fried fish with spicy &sour sauce & steamed rice.For desserts, we had sticky rice with durian and sticky rice withmango.The green curry chicken & kangkong were satisfactory but did not shine out.The mixed platter of starters came after most other dishes were served andI found the rice crackers thick & not crispy enough.The best dish was the fried fish with spicy & sour sauce.Food rating : 5.5 out of 10 point
4
The food is just about right, not really fantastic, but the service is pretty good and serving staffs are pleasant. It is value for money, especially the lunch set and dinner buffet.
3
The set dinner is good value especially seafood choice. Taste could be better for a highly commented place. Service is great.

My wife and I enjoyed an unexpectedly good Thai meal at Suanthai, after a little shopping a nearby malls. Unexpected, because we had not heard of this place, and I only knew of it because I work nearby.We opted for their set dinner (the cheaper one) for 2-3 persons. It turned out to be a feast for us, and a lovely hit to our senses. The colours presented were brilliant, the fragrance of the food alluring, and the tastes reminiscent of what I had experienced in Bangkok and other parts of Thailand. We had the popular Thai green mango salad, seafood stir-fry with Thai accents, stir-fried leafy greens, tom-yum soup, Thai green curry chicken, and sweet tapioca dessert. The portions, I think, can serve 3-4 persons. Very generous. They have a nice enough selection for beer/wine drinkers (although I think the prices could be a little lower for the bottled beers). Other than set meals, of course you can order from their a la carte menu, but I think the most popular choice among diners would be their "a la carte buffet" (very good value for those who love buffets!)Suanthai does not purport to being a fine dining establishment, and from the interior design to the cutlery used, this restaurant definitely sits in the "family dining" category, and I feel it does well in this space with its calm, relaxing atmosphere. Their service was efficient, and polite. The many awards on display in the restaurant would strengthen their case.Perhaps there are better Thai restaurants in Singapore, but for it's price, this place is pretty darn good!Highly recommended, especially for a family or group meal

My wife and I invited 4 of our Chinese friends for dinner at Suanthai. We were advised to make a reservation and were given a round table which made it easier for communication. The menu is extensive with many Thai specialities and the quality of the food was excellent. The manage of the restaurant was attentive and dealt well with a couple of special needs which we had. Alcohol can be purchased although as is the norm in Singapore it is expensive due primarily to heavy taxes and/or import duties.One word of caution when selecting dishes, spicy really means spicy at this restaurant so for those who can't take overly hot food, it would be best to discuss their needs with the manager prior to ordering
2
Flew in late from Siam Reap so as this was local we opted for a quick tasty Thai! Service was ok and they offered a bowl of prawn crackers with a dip with our Beers! Little did we expect to get charged $2.50 for these and 60c for the hand wipes!!!! The Green Prawn curry was prawns and eggplant and mostly sauce and the chicken basil stir fry was just mince on wilted lettuce! Ok but not special! We were astounded that this would cost $58!!!! Lesson learnt! .....

The tom yum soup really had the 'kick'! It was spicy and sourish ... that which could send you tearing. Generous portion of the mango salad and rich in shrimp paste. However the papaya salad was quite a disappointment - a tad bland. Chicken wrapped in pandan leaves were juicy and tasty, but many of the chicken dishes did not taste like authentic Thai. Satay chicken was tender and richly marinated. Fish cake was quite miserable and lack spices. The wait staff were friendly and attentive
1
I was there with a friend and we wanted to go looking for a good Thai food, not too pretentious, and we went to Suanthai.I ordered a mango salad for less than 7 dollars , while my friend took a padthai. Since we had been waiting and were hungry, I asked the staff to get some cashew nuts with our drinks, but even after the staff said no, impossible because not in the menu, I kept on also asking the manager whether there was any chance that they could make an exception. Even after the manager had very firm negative answer, I was kindly asking if, paying separately I could get some. They brought a very little portion, but the greatest surprise was the check, since they had been accounted as a main special plate, with 10 dollars top up bill. I tried to clarify, but as an explanation, they simply replied that it is a very special plate and every special main plate has a fixed price of 10 dollars, for indication of the chef.I can't stand being ripped off like this, seriously. These people don't know what a service is
4
I liked this popular thai restaurant, the food was authentic, the service good. However it was noisy, a sign that the clients were enjoying the food and the ambiance was very informal.The sticky mango rice was so good that we ordered takeaway portions for our absent friends
4
Went To Suanthai Restaurant to eat its buffet with a group of friends. The tom yam soup is really spicy and sour which I love it! Just prepare a few more packets of tissue will do. The pandan chicken is a must-try, as well as the satay chicken! Just top-up $3.99+ for free flow lemon tea. Do take note that certain dishes from the menu can only be ordered once,so technically it is not really like a buffet. Dishes have to be ordered via the waitress/waiter. As for the service, the staff who served us was a little rude to us
2
Very impersonal service, could not get a glass of water with the meal unless we paid for a bottle. The Pad Thai was at the lower end of our expectations and was nearly as awful as the worst one we ever had, in London. Certainly did not taste like any we have had in Bangkok or northern Thailand. To top it off, we were charged 30c each for a wet-wipe towel, and $2.50 for a bowl of crispy 'tidbits' which we thought were complimentary, as they appeared without our asking
4
Wanted a change from the regular food being served in the hotel we stayed, found the thai cousine served at Suanthai very good and at a very reasonable rate.
3
I had a Sunday lunch here as a guest of a colleague. We shared various dishes: green curry, pad thai, green mango salad. All fine. Apparently it can get very crowded but we were there early and had no problem.
4
We went there with 15 colleagues. Place is not fancy but food is really good for the price. Try the pad thai, fish cake, green curry chicken and olive rice. Will definitively go back.
5
Excellent food. Try the thai green curry and the pad thai. The free flow lemon ale is also a great deal. The starters are great too.
4
Here is another popular place on killiney road. Always packed with attractive packaged meals. Basic decent thai food with good prices close to Somerset MRT. The less crowded side of Orchard. Fish cake, salads and green curry are our favorites.
5
Like the tom yam soup, sour enough. The cashew but chicken, chicken sarah , chicken wing are very tasty. Nice n recommended
5
Whenever come to Thai, my choice would be either Suanthai, Thanying and Sabai.. Suanthai is definitely a place where you can enjoy good food, good ambience and cheap Thai cuisine. I would always recommend my friends if they wanted something Authentic n affordable. Everything here is excellent especially the Tom yam soup which you can choose the spiciness you want, green curry, soft shell crab, stuff chicken wing, mango sticky rice, mango salad and definitely the tapioca. Do book in advance and you can go for the ala carte buffet as it's very reasonable price.
3
I've went there for buffet lunch coupon I bought from deal.com.sg. Before I go, my impression about buffet is several tables with food ready to serve on it. However, in Suanthai, the buffet is different. You'll be given a menu, and after you orders, the chefs just will start to cook.I must say when compare to usual buffet, this was quite nice, as the food will be serve hot and fresh. However, I also need to admit that the food aren't very delicious.Overall, when compare taste to the price and service, I'll rate this restaurant as reasonable

I have been here many times and have only ever ordered Pad Thai which has been ok, hard to mess up I guess.This time, however, I ordered beef with thai basil and chili. It was absolutely phenomenally bad, as in I'd think twice about serving it to a dog. It was NOT beef, it was one of those super cheap re-processed 'beef' substitutes, pumped-up with water. It had no taste and the texture was like rubber. There was no thai basil to speak of so the entire flavour was chili oil, that's it. No waiters asked how my meal was so when they came to collect my plate at the end I mentioned all of this. Since I was in a rush I decided it was easier to not re-order. The head waiter checked with the head chef and they said that the dish was as they intended it. Therefore they charged me S$26 for this (with 1 beer).Appalling food and appalling customer service.So aside fro

My hubby and I went for a last min christmas eve dinner buffet at this place with 2 of his very good friends. For the buffet price we are paying, I guessed there's nothing more we could complain.Our friends arrived earlier than us but advised that the manager was not really serving them well upon arrival. When we came, we decided to have the buffet and ordered the food. We guessed if we have ordered ala carte from the menu, the service together with the food would have been much better. We have ordered some food and we merely asked them to check and was told in the end, when you order, it is in the queue, so when we asked the second time, the food order was added into the queue again. Ask and order is 2 different things... I seriously do not believe such simple things they can also highlight it is customer's fault.In addition, there were food items that came more than once. We did not order, nor did we ask to follow up on orders, they came, we also took in. As the food were getting too much, we have no choice to stop their orders for items which have came more than twice to our tables.. and the manager told us that they have threw away 2 sets of it prior to us ordering again...We also asked for the bill when there is no crowd but the bill came quite a while.Basically, if you would to ask, this unpleasant dinning experience indeed spoil of christmas eve mood. I serious would not recommend to go as we saw that they were some award winning restuarants, thus we went, but...
2
We bought 2 deals dinner coupon. It looked good & delicious when I saw it online. It turned out to be a disappointing meal. Certain dishes are too salty. Not recommended. Do not be deceived by the beautiful pictures.
5
We basically go there 2/3 times a week... everything we ordered was superb... Try the Coconut based Tom Yom its exploding with flavours
3
Super speedy service and a very short wait for food.
Great satay chicken, an okay pad thai and fairly average green chicken curry for $40.
It was okay, I will try a few other places before I go back again.
5
We ate here three times during our trip and each time it was gorgeous. Nice tables outside the front, great service. And the food it sooooo yummy, genuine thai flavours. Want to go back to singapore just to eat here again!

Just had the set lunch at this neighborhood Thai restaurant. The food was OK as I did not expect much from the food for a fixed lunch. The service was good and the staff was willing to accommodate my request for sugar free Ice Lemon Tea.What shocked me was the 95 cents I was charged for the tap water (It is a bit rich for a neighborhood restaurant). This is really disappointing. not so sure if I would visit again.Is is really worth losing customers over
3
Just came back from lunch at this thai restaurant. Food was nothing great to shout about. The ambience & food was just a-okay. Had their set lunch which is priced at SGD 12 per pax. Rice was served with two side dish on the same plate. Something that I did not expect. Was expecting something better from a restaurant. We ordered our appetizer however the main course was served first before appetizer. The spring roll was not appetizing at all. The fillings in the spring rolls was exposed and was fried. I will not be visiting this restaurant again
2
I bought 6 deal dinner coupons (mistake) and oh my, the salad is not fresh - too sweet and too sour. On top of that, the additional cost of GST, plus weekend surplus though its sunday at $2 per person and it is not Thai Buffet per say. It's ala carte buffet. Having said that, the worst was the seats - very narrow, very squeezy and uncomfortable. I am not sure if URA allows that many people in that small cramped place for fire safety reasons. It was totally caught by surprise kind of dining for the family. Having said that, the service was good though the workers are stressed (you can sense it) and so the ambience makes the food less tasty =
2
I bought a coupon from deal website. It seemed to b cheap when i saw on website. But after adding gst, service tax n drinks, it was more expensive than normal buffets. Foods are so-so, but they were prepared in small dishes. It wont satisfied ur appetite.U have to order repeat n repeat to get another plates. The worst things was my friend found a staples in green mango salad. What a dangerous case. That can make us die. But the staff, named Paul, just said sorry n took the plate back. What a shameful service in singapore. Definitely, i wont go there again
4
My friend and I had buffet lunch on a Sunday for S$18 and it was excellent, way much than you can eat. You can order from a list where is indicated which dishes you can order only once and which ones as many times as you want. For S$ 3 more you can have half a liter of ice tea, calamansi or other juices with it. Dessert buffet was disappointing
1
To be completely honest, my impression of Suanthai Restauran's food wasnâ€™t good. I spent S115 for 5 person buffet. ( i BOUGHT FROM INTERNET) The food is average and not the as delicious as what I search from review. It made us so ..........but the service is very good. The only dish I like is mango salad
