Part of the coffee bean & tea leaf group, and i went to the branch at Marina bay sands. Glad they opened for breakfast on chinese new yearNice location by the fountain . Noisy, but there's a breeze each time the water thunders downThey have a mix of simple items like muffins and big plates. They also appear to serve lunch/dinner with pastas and mainsAverage foo

We stopped here for a drink and to rest our weary legs. I had only seen the whirlpool for above and didn't even know it came out in the mall. After checking the times we realised we were an hour away from the next launch, so we ordered lunch and waited. It was well worth it. I had a Caesar with smoked salmon and my partner had soft shell crab All good

We were very disappointed to get a portion of musli in just a cocktail glass and to get a waffle with just one cut strawberry and two blueberries. The menu clearly stated waffles with berries. After much complaint we got more fruit, but the musli they refused to refill. That was not a satisfying breakfast and i suggest you avoid this mediocre place

Nice restaurant in posh shopping centre. As it was lunchtime we waited for a table. The tables ring the gondola canal, nice setting. A torrent of water pours occasionally through a hole above in the glass roof into the gondola canal. The food was ok, not fantastic but fine. They only serve tea and coffee. Ice cold for both, I tried the coffee which was good. No beer or soft drinks. They also give a small responder on the table with which you call for service and also for the bill. Overall nice place to have lunch.

Great Café place at the MBS (Marina Bay Sands) Way better then expected being in a large Mall, service very good, helpful and courteous, the dishes are very good, toped off with a great Café, and a very nice view of the water fall, when you take a table out side of the restaurant. We will be back to this relaxing café place, when back in Singapore

At first glance, Beanstro looks like one of those tourist traps in any mall, where you can expect anything from bad to decent, but nothing more, service, food and drinks. Ask for a table outside, and you get to sit next to a nice waterfall (once an hour), by the Venetian canal. It is cool (both meanings!) and relaxing, and you get to take in the luxury shops in the Shoppes area of the Marina Bay. The service at Beanstro is typical Singalese - not as good as you would expect in luxury places, but not as bad as in Norway or Netherlands...The coffee is excellent. Especially the cold-brew is a must-try. I prefer the natural one (no sugar or milk), your taste may be different. Also try the one with mint - very refreshing on a hot day. If tea is your thing, I expect their teas to be of equal quality (but I did not have it). I ate here several days (convenience drew me here, then the coffee got me coming back). The food were of much better quality than expected for a place like this. I had steak sandwich of above average quality, but the best meal by far was the braised short-ribs. A full-flavour beef taste of the meat, nicely matched by the gravy (sauce for the rest of us). Served on a layer of mashed potato, this dish was just great. (That said, if you only have a few days in Singapore, you should not be eating here, instead head out to one of the local food-markets, or if in a hurry, walk to the opposite side of the mall, and indulge yourself at the food court.)Beanstro is a place I will be back at. For coffee, for business meetings, and for the braised short-ribs!

Went for dinner with my mother, had never been before and won't ever be back. No one wanted to take our order and when we eventually ordered my food arrived 20 minutes before my mums ; I couldn't let it go cold so started eating by myself. When my mums food finally arrived there was no apology for the wait and it was plonked in front of her next to my empty plate that went uncollected. We honestly couldn't get out of here fast enough, but they had trouble with their eftpos machine and asked if I had another card as their machine wasn't accepting it. As I was travelling from overseas I had no spare but they got it to work in the end. Not a relaxing experience at all - defiantly would not recommend

We usually sit outside around the 'pond' and have had the whirlpool upstairs (an attraction which uses rainwater) unleash itself into the pond below. it may get loud so it'll be hard to talk while that's happening but usually, all eyes are fixed on the spectacle of the furious gushes. Food is ok, tea and coffee ok too! It is a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf sister company after all. Being in a premium tourist location though, it is a little pricier than usual but portions are decent for the price. They serve all day breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner

Food was decent. A little pricey for the amount you receive on certain meals. The servers never checked on us let alone others it seemed like they did not care if you was there or not. Would go back but would not be a top 5 place to g
