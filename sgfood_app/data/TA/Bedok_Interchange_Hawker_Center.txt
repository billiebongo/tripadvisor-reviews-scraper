Easy access from MRT or Bus interchange, this hawker centre has all the usual stalls found in Hawker centres. Clean and well maintained, it is a welcomed stop for most residents here.
Excellent of Chinese and Halal food.

For me certainly a must go and eat at these hawker centers. Food is amazing and so cheap. As tourist you might think not so clean, but it is pretty safe. This is real genuin Singapore.

Very popular with the locals this well ventilated and clean Hawker Market is a good place to step away from the tourist routes without going far from a MRT station. Also close to the Mall so handy for shopping/eating trip.

We ordered a few local dishes like noodle soup, nasi lemak, oyster fried egg and it actually taste good. The only thing that we were concerned about was the hygience.

This hawker centre is right above Bedok MRT and next to Bedok bus interchange. Also surrounding the hawker centre are neighbourhood shops and supermarkets for a stroll. Filled with local favourites so sure to find something that match your taste buds.

This is definitely a place to go for tourists who wants a taste of local food of Singapore.Things to know when you get there:- Find a table for yourself first, once you have found an empty table - have someone at the table and you take turn to look for the food that you like to eat- You will need to order the food, pay for it, wait for the food and bring the food back to your table- Bring wet wipes, very often, the table are not clean, the cleaner are not fast enough to clean the tables when previous diner vacate the table- Bring paper towels with you, it is not provided- Public washrooms are available, they are clean, you have to pay 10 cents to get in.The Best part:There is so many different variations of food available, if you are unsure, there are pictures on the top of the stall with prices attached to it. Be adventurous and try them. Do some homework and goggle local food of Singapore. You will find all of them available in Bedok Interchange Hawker Center. There is Chinese, Indian, Halah food, main course, side dishes, snack dishes , dessert.Happy Eatin

This place is next to Bedok Mall, which is only few mins walk from Bedok MRT station. There are big variety of local food to choose, the price here would be cheaper than the mall itself. If you are tourist, you might not get used to local hawker culture but it can be a good experience to eat like the local. For tourists, do note that you have to pay money and take the food by yourself; it is free seating so please grab or share a table

This al fresco dining place have variety going for them ... where food offers are concerned.Local favourites priced reasonably.What is discomforting, however, is the tendency for vacated tables to be left to the birds to pick at. The feathered frenzy is unhygienic as it is unwelcomed.Maybe the way out is to take-out .... ie buy and go... and don't dine in

We were here many years ago when the bus interchange was right beside it. It was hot and noisy then. So it is quite a pleasant surprise to find it completely renovated with a high ceiling and an extension for more stalls. The authorities have also moved the bus interchange so the ambience is so much better. Only one more area to improve: better and more varied choices of food stalls.

Visited Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre for lunch today.Had nasi lemak for lunch.After lunch, observed that there is a weekend market operating, selling variety of products, ranging from food to daily use items. Spend about10 minutes browsing the display placed by each stalls. Not really special. Good to walk by during pastime

This place was totally revamped only after almost 30 years !!
Some of the old hawkers are original but very few...so not all are original or great food.!!

Homely feeling and almost everything around this place....
Lovely Mall with all type of shops
Around this place you have everything
Once the CC sports complex complicated, this place is unbeatable.

Visited Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre yesterday.Decided to try on the halal food for dinner. Saw queue at #01-64. Inspirasi serving Mee Soto. Ordered. Paid $2.50. Wow, the chicken broth soup was really fantastic. Tender chicken and noodles. Really worth the short wait.Expect long queue during lunch hour, 12 noon - 1.30pm (about 12 minutes). Stall closed on Sunday.Enjoyed the local meal

Was at Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre for lunch today. Spotted long queue at this Lor Mee & Prawn Mee Stall on the first row facing New Upper Changi Road. Joined the queue to get a bowl of Lor Mee and Dry Prawn Mee. The queue is about 10+ minutes. Non stop queue even gotten my food. Patrons just queued patiently for a good bowl of humble meal.Lor mee was really good. Prawn mee was acceptable too. Prices range from $3, $4 and $5.Enjoyed

Growing up in the quaint neighbourhood of Bedok, I grew up eating all kind of delicious food from all different cultures. Bedok is one of the few rare gems left where its not tainted by commercialism. Cheap hawker food at its best, one would have to be there to see how great the variety is. Don't miss it

Visited Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre this day. The place is clearly divided between halal and non-halal sections. Place was crowded during lunchtime.It was little warm within the hawker centre. Many plates, bowls amd trays were left on the tables after food consumption. Patrons waiting for tables. Poor cleaners were struggling to clear. Still a clean place to dine. Food are sold at reasonable prices.Few stalls were having reasonably long queue. Saw queue at 明辉 nasi lemak (corner stall on row 4) decided to pack a packet of non-halal nasi lemak ($2.80) and go home to enjoy in comfortable aircon hall.The food was good, especially the sambal.Enjoyed

The Bedok Interchange hawker center is right next to the Bedok MRT station as well as the Bedok mall. Both trains and busses come through here, making it a busy node in the local transport network.The hawker center isn't huge by local standards, but it is very open and airy in its design, making it highly recommendable to people who find the many smells of these places to be a little intense for them. There is also a nice plaza right next to the center, if you don't like to sit at the tables.The selection of food is average for Singapore, but you can get all the main cuisines at most hours of the day. It is a good place to just hop off the train, have a bit of something and then continue on your way.This hawker center is also one of the cleanest I've visited. I am not saying any of them are truly dirty, since Singapore does have very high standards for this sort of thing, but you will certainly run into some that aren't quite as spick'n'span. I think Casual would be a good word for the Bedok Interchange hawker center. It isn't too big, you can easily just wander in and out of it thanks to the open, street-level design, and there's space to eat outside of it as well. It is mostly aimed at locals, so you won't have to put up with too many tourists

Probably the biggest interchange where you can almost everything. Most come here for the money changers, you can best SGD to Ringgit rates here, but remember to check out more than one as the rates varies. The neighbourhood stores offers lots of stuff at very reasonable price. Lots of good & cheap food in the hawker, not the one right next to the market but walk further along towards Sheng Siong, pass by NTUC, and that is the famous hawker center

On 5 Aug 2016 visited Bedok Interchange Hawker Centre for lunch. Nearest MRT will be Bedok station. Located opposite Bedok MRT station and beside Bedok Mall.The new revamped hawker centre is cleaner and airy. Better ventilation. Wide selections of local Chinese, Malay halal & Indian halal cuisines. Well organised into Halal and Non-Halal ones. All stalls operating on self serve basis. Good selections of dessert and light snacks stalls too.Quality food at affordable prices. Queue expected at certain popular stalls. There's a multi storey car park next to it catering to those who drives.
