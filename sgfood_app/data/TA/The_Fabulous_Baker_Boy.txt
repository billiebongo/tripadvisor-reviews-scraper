Food was great, huge portion and environment was really good with nice view of plants and flowers. The place was really busy but the staffs were really polite and efficient.
5
Met my bridesmaids to discuss about wedding matters which is a great nice place ...food is good but service was a little slow...price is a little $$
4
It’s located just opposite Liang Court and at the Fort Canning. Good to take a break at this small cafe after a morning run.
5
Great location and excellent bread but service is poor. Most waiters dont know the menu and are slow to respond. .......
2
Parking directions at location not great. For dessert only cakes and no other choice. The cakes were not really nice but the hot choco was quite good.
4
I was last here in 2012 and i remembered this place for their yummy cakes! Turns out it didn disappoint and now they have more yunmy cakes, and a pretty extensive menu! :)
4
We walked over from Fort Canning Hotel for breakfast, nice coffee and nice eggs benedict.Having read some recent reviews on here about the service etc I'd say what do you expect ? it`s a cafe not a white table cloth restaurant As an observation, the service blockage appears to be at the coffee machine as in the operator not being able to handle the volume of coffees ordered. The morning I was there there were quite few people who had just come in for take-away coffees which added to the wait
3
Cafe was understaffed. Was ordering halfway when the staff chose to answer a phone call and had to ask his colleague to attend to me. The phone rang again while he was taking my orders and he kept looking over at the phone. Food wise, we had the chicken pie and chicken with waffles. The pie had way too much potatoes - in the pie itself, and as fries as a side. Waffles was nice though. Crisp on the outside and fluffy inside.
5
Went there specifically to try their desserts as we were nearby. Wide selection of desserts with many unique cakes and breads. We had the Carrot Cake and Dark Chocolate cake and were surprised by how moist and good they were. Price could be considered to be on the steep side but with a serving size that huge and with such quality, it was definitely worth it. Would be very interested in trying their brunch too one day!
4
Had the grilled salmon, tuna melt and a slice of "Luna" cake. Salmon is a solid 11 out of 10, while the tuna melt and cake were pretty good too. Food portions were gigantic and we struggled to fit the cake in our tummy. Coffee was pretty pricey ($6.50 for a flat white) so we tried the Fab Iced Tea (yummy - maybe the secret ingredient is rose?).Great view of the baker at work through the glass panelled kitchen. Acoustics of the place seemed to amplify white noise so not the ideal place to chillax. Highly recommend for the salmon though
3
Thumbs up for the eggs benny! We tried both the spinach and salmon option - and both were equally satisfying!
5
Excellent venue and food, really good service. The cakes were delicious.
No more to say and have to use up characters
2
Although my reservation was made for 1pm, I was told that I would not get a table for another 30mins. Apparently other people who had come earlier received the table. Food also took 45mins to an hour to arrive.
5
2nd time I have been there. Food was good and service was attentive as well. Love the French toast which is done well.
4
The Fabulous Baker Boy serves delicious meals and lovely cakes in a beautiful corner of the Fort Canning Hill. It’s a cosy place for everyone who love to have a cup of hot coffee before starting the day. Would recommend cake lovers to come by as there’s a huge assortment of cakes to try:
3
I should have stuck with the pancakes that looked amazing, I had the corned beef hash which ok and not like any corn beef hash I've had before and would have liked it to be more like a US standard. the comments from friends was similar and the menu looked great but the end result was disappointing. Next time i will for sure have the pancakes.Service was slow and staff not attentive
4
Food is delicious and I like the ambient very much. I like the cafe design as there is a Show kitchen how the cake was bake. Went at brunch hour I think is the peak hour the kitchen is busy food is a bit slow (maybe is us too hungry after yoga class) but good food worth the wait and portions of the food is pretty huge
5
I had the raspberry pancakes and they were great! Freshly cooked, light and flavourful. Done right. Also had a croissant- which was an almond coated sweet croissant: very nice as a dessert. They also had sourdough croissants but I need to come back to try those.Service was very good too.Oh- and good internet too
5
Moist cakes..tasty food..good ambience admist the greenery! I will be back for more! We went there for lunch at about 4pm and sadly the kitchen was close, we were told to have some cakes instead.. It turn out to be so so good! In the end we savour our cakes till 6pm till the kitche re-open and we told ourselves that we have to try the mains!
5
I have just arrived in Singapore yesterday enroute to see my son in New Zealand.I have been on walkabout near our hotel and found the fabulousbakerboy cafe.I have just eaten some amazing local quality home made food which is all freshly made to order so prepare to wait for your food to arrive however when it does arrive you will be amazed.They have fantastic teas as well as gluten free option on breads.They are open for breakfast lunch and evening meals too.This has to be a place to eat quality healthy food at reasonable prices.They provide free large bottles of water on the table too.I'm pretty confident you will not disappointed at this fine cafe.PS They have some amazing cakes to choose from and share a slice (see picture
5
Food is great. Fantastic value for money. Sourdough croissant is out of the world. Cakes are yummy and super instagrammable.
4
Lovely cakes and a nice quiet ambience for a catch up with friends. Too bad the coffee machine was down when I visited. The staff wasn’t very knowledgeable and the manager had to step in.
4
Cinnamon French Toast was spectacular! Pancakes and corned hash was excellent too. Will be back to try their cakes!
2
Tried this place for the first time - nice coffee, ok food, fairly clueless staff. It’s a very nice location in the middle of a nice park, so it would be a lovely brunch place if it could fix the food and service.
3
very average food and overpriced. not worth the price and not value for money. nothing fantastic or amazing.
3
Came here on a lazy Thursday morning with the day off.Wife had the Towkay Ng eggs Benny, while I had the fried French Toast.They do put a warning that the French toast is not for the faint hearted, but that isn't really the problem. The term used in Singapore is "Jelat", which is used to describe a sensation not of satiety, but that you just can't stomach anymore.Deep fried, and served with generous amounts of syrup and cinnamon sugar, this is OK for multiple people to share a plate. EVERYONE in the restaurant at the same time as us who ordered the French toast left at least 1 piece on the plate untouched.The eggs Benny and croissant were good, but nothing to phone home about.Now the cakes. These are the true STARS. So spoilt for choice, and with each one looking prettier than the last, we opted for the carrot cake. Yummy, dense, not too sweet, and a generous topping of grated coconut.Would go back for the cakes, but have lunch beforehand.
2
We have made a reservation via chope, they said they couldn’t find our reservation wich was embarrassing. Then, they serve us expired coke light. Probably, they left the cans outside with sunny weather. They forgot the order of my Friend. To be fair, They apologief professionally about it, but it was bad after bad after bad. I don’t recommend
5
I love this place cos it's kinda in the middle of a park (aka nature). The food was great, love the cakes, & the price was really affordable. Kinda craving the chilli crab mac & cheese now, which I recommend to be shared by 2-3pax, it was too much for myself. The garlic fries was delicious too (shared among 3pax)
4
Cafe has a nice ambiance, and located in a pretty nice location though bring an umbrella during the rainy season because from the cafe to the road and bus stop there isn't any shelter. As stated on their site food served is halal but they serve alcoholic drinks, which is similar to some cafes in Arab St. The cafe is not very big so especially on peak periods you should make a reservation. My friends would say I am picky with my food but personally I thought the chilli crab mac and cheese was delicious. Might be too cheesy/heavy for some people. It is a bit spicy too. Serving was pretty big so I was very full after. Had a taste of the mash potatoes my friend was having with her almond crusted salmon and it was soooo good. Another friend had the fry up and although it's a bit pricey the serving is seriously a lot. We had to help her finish some food. I really wanted a chocolate drink but they were out of stock of cocoa powder but the little biscuits that they served with our coffee tasted really good. Wish they sold it at the cafe. Each table also had a big bottle of ice water. I was too full after lunch to try their bakes but they all looked really nice.Service was generally good though our food took some time to come. My dish came last and that was a wait time of at least 45 mins. It was New Year's eve and there were lots of people. The food that came tasted good tho
4
We ordered The Fab Egg Benny with additional sausages. Slightly pricey, but overall the meal tasted okay. Would have skipped the sausages (portion was very small and cost $4.50). Cafe was quite packed for a Sunday afternoon at 1pm and the waitstaff seemed pretty overwhelmed. Tucked away in a corner of Fort Canning Park, which is great if you love being away from the hustle and bustle of city life, but kinda inaccessible otherwise.
4
My new favourite cake there is Luna. I wish that they serve savouries too during the post-lunch pre-dinner hours (we were there from 4.30 to 5.45 pm)
4
One of the best cafes around, great ambiance, great food and value for money. Service was good and servers were friendly! A definite must go!
4
theFrench toast was a distant cousin of the cinnamon donuts, but smelled so good! Used chope voucher.
3
Thank you so much to the staff member who held our table (we were slightly late). The food was slightly underwhelming.
5
Fun....good food. A bit short of staff at times. But still great! Been many times and will be back :) the cakes are to die for!
5
It was my second time there and the place is located in a really nice, quiet place near nature. The food was good for the price and staff were very helpful. Loved it and highly recommend their cakes too!
3
We were super excited about coming here as it was recommended in a few online reviews. It is located in a beautiful part of Singapore not far from the river and over looking a park. We had the eggs Benedict. The food was beautifully presented but wasn’t that flavoursome. The coffee was delicious and the aroma of the cafe is amazing. If you are coming with a group you will need to book. Well at least now I can tick this place off my places to visit. It was nice but once is enough
4
We had the brioche French toast with sausage and bacon which was absolutely fluffy but a tad too sweet and the encrusted salmon which was really yummy. Love the garden feel and great service. Salmon took longer to be prepared but I guess that means it’s freshly cooked
3
the tomato salad is nice. generous with the olive sourdough croutons, the vegetable is fresh and the tomato give a hint of sourness (vinaigrette)The tuna sandwich comes which salad and serve on home made sour dough bread. I like the caramalized onion.The croissant is fresh, but nothing fantastic.They sell cakes (at least 10 variety), and they make daily-fresh, unfortunately I have no more room for dessert.The cafe is not very big, therefore advice to make reservation especially during the weekend
5
Was back there on Saturday night where they had only about 15 types of cakes. Thai tea and humming bird cakes were yummy. Views split on carrot cake while red velvet didn’t impress, tasted rather floury. Unfortunately one of the two fried chicken with waffle orders came with undercooked chicken. The subsequent replacement chicken was overcooked and burnt rather black, possibly make up for the earlier screwup? Still, an enjoyable visit.
4
Had the downward Scotty and it was delicious. Salmon was not too salty and the dressing used went well with the salad. Would come again.
4
A nice place to have catch up with family and friends. Many varieties of cakes choices and cakes are delicious. Can't wait to try the different flavours in the future
3
Average food but pretty pricey for a brunch place. Service was unfriendly. Makes it unpleasant. Won’t come again
4
We are returning customers for weekend brunch. The food is always great - especially the pancakes. However, you need to be very, very patient. We waited nearly an hour for our food to arrive. Other than that, it's a really nice place.
5
Brought here by my bestie on a recent trip to Singapore. She actually brought me here to have pancakes however we were advised that they didn't have pancake that day so we thought we'd try some cakes.I bought a slice of "Ms Jacintha" and my friend had the "Lady Marmalade". Now, I'm not usually a cake person but I have to say that these cakes were so delicious that I could not stop eating it. The flavours were do die for - I wished that they had them here in Sydney.Will definitely be back when I'm next in Singapore
4
Good breakfast at a lovely location in a beautiful park. Great service. We went on a Sunday for breakfast, and there were a lot of families with young kids so sound level was high for a Sunday morning. Slight expat feel.I'd recommend booking in advance.Eggs Benedict was good, French toast as well but rather sweet and rich for brekkie to our taste
4
Always thought that this place would be very inaccessible by public transport and far to walk to but was extremely pleased with the ease of access. Serving size for the dishes were generous, especially the fry up. The Fab french toast was really fab, but couldn't really say the same for the Fab Iced Tea which kinda made me questioned paying for coloured iced water.
3
Different views in flavour... some view slightly burnt toast & potatoes bring out more flavour... not for us though... to us, it taste bitter. $10 for a small glass of fruit juice... Mmm... hard to accept. Pancakes were soggy in the centre & slightly burnt outside... a taste we find not accustomed to ...Perhaps they are just not ready for breakfast crowd or they are just exhausted... can't feel the love in their cooking...
4
My daughter and I were very thankful that we were able to redeem vouchers from our points accumulation from chope to enjoy this tea break treat. It was a great reward for my daughter who had just finished her stressful PSLE early this month. The environment is so peaceful & tranquil, with the delicious cakes & hot tea, it was a great afternoon bonding for us
4
Had their brunch: Fab Fry Up and Fab Egg Benny. Above average brunch however their cakes are AWESOME! There are so many choices and flavours! I had their Chocolate Caramel and their Luna. Its really nice and yummy! I would definitely go back for their cakes though the cost is a little more pricey than other cafes but i think its worth the price
3
Nice ambience, very average food. 5 of us spent a total of $204. A little expensive for a casual cafe setting.
4
Had the chili crab mac and cheese and the chicken pot pie. Service staff were efficient as the plates were cleared rather quickly and they were also friendly.
4
The lobster mac & cheese was not bad :) The chicken and waffles was average for me. Nothing to rave about.
5
On the River Valley Road, at a corner of the Fort Canning Park, behind trees and a parking, this nice restaurant is located.Had a breakfast on Thursday.It has become a great start of the day.The staff is friendly and kind.Foods are well displayed and delicious.The ambience and some music are nice and relaxing yet encouraging.Good experience.Thank you very much
5
We went here today for a late breakfast and we loved it!Great French toast and Tuna melt, big portions, nice atmosphere and music. Good value for money!Also love the fact that they put a bottle of tap water on the table when you sit down, good service.Coffee's and juices bit high priced.Cakes look amazing too, but we were already stuffed
3
My wife & I visited the cafe for Sunday brunch. The reviews we read were mixed but decided to give it a go.The ambience is nice with ample seating.We ordered cinnamon pancakes & the salmon. The service was pretty slow, the salmon was good but the pancakes were a disappointment.We finished with a chocolate cake (the Luna) which was above average but as is quite often the case with desserts ..looked much better than it tasted
3
7 of us visited here for a birthday breakfast. We were the first to arrive at 8:30am. Tea, coffee (albeit small serving) and muesli were OK. Pancakes received positive reviews from our table and everyone loved the french toast. All dishes didn't arrive at the same time and we weren't able to try any pastries as they hadn't finished baking. Over-priced for what we received and the service wasn't fantastic, but everything was generally OK
1
Please do not order their so-called French toast. It's a sham. Deep fried bread entirely coated with sugar and cinnamon. Who does French toast like that? It's a heart attack served on a plate. I couldn't even take a second bite of it. It is unethical to even serve such deadly food to your customers. The staff didn't even consider to waive the charges for this dish to make things right. I was a regular customer of this place, but I'm never coming back. Never again
5
I saw all other excellent reviews and they weren't wrong. Had 2 types of french toast and pancakes, which we all fantastic and generous portions. Coffee (italian type) and fruit juice were on expensive side but were very nice.We were so impressed that bought some take-out danish and croissant which were also very nice. We would have gone back a few time, but found it too hot to walk from our hotel to cafe at 8:30am
3
I have been wanting to try this restaurant for months, so I got pretty dissapointed. Eventhough the portions are quite big, the service quality really made me feel uncomfortable : the first thing that got into the table was the bill for the items ordered so far (even though I was pretty determines to try the cakes), why didn't make sense being the dessert one of the most talked about things.Besides that I received the drinks I have order twice, same as my food order and also the menu was given when I have not requested for it.One of the staff attempted to remove my husband plate while he still was chewing and have not finished his food and when I finally order my cake slice, it took so long that I just finally settled the bill they gave me since the very beginning.
3
Eggs benedict was pretty decent, the portion for the fried dory fish chunks was quite generous. We didn't like the french toast with sausage and turkey bacon. Service was ok, location was inside fort canning.
3
The Luna cake was pretty decent. Chilli crab MAC and cheese was alright. The chicken pot was a tad blend
4
Second time there and I was still awed with the selections of cakes. Great vibe all around and will definitely head there till I run out of desserts to try!
2
My 2nd time at FBB and although food was good, service has always been unimpressive.Mostly inexperienced and untrained staff.Be it the 'host' or the wait staff.Last week will be my last patronising the cafe.
5
The place was cosy and had a homely feeling. Great for gathering with friends or dinner with your partner.
4
Sept 2017. Arriving at the Fabulous Baker Boy Cafe you soon work out this place is popular ! Staff were quick to welcome guests and did their very best to seat us as soon as possible despite being over-run with diners. Our meals were served in an appropriate amount of time and we very much enjoyed the fare on offer. Would we return..... that's a definite yes. Good location looking out into Canning Park, great service (albeit a little slow due to how busy they were --- but that's understandable) and quality food at prices to be expected in Singapore. Well done to the Fabulous Baker Boy cafe! We liked you
5
FBB iS definitely our favourite cafe in Singapore. We love this place for everything location, ambiance, food their cakes everything. This time visited with our friends for Saturday brunch who were here for their holiday and they also enjoyed their food and had great time here. So FFB is a must visit place if you are in Singapore.
4
Food is always good, the eggs benedict is runny and cooked to perfection. Service can get slow during crowded hours.
5
Yummy cakes, fried Chicken and waffles. Enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Worst part was having to choose two Flavours of cake from among 28 Flavours! Settled for chinoiserie and Hossan Leong. The former was a light sponge with lychee flavour while the latter was a dense cake with layers of hazelnut cream. Both absolutely yummy with the latter being generous in size. Friend and I had to roll ourselves out of the place. Good thing we shared one Main between the two of us. We will be back for the other 26 Flavours of cake. Perhaps they should make a "I have eaten" VIP card where customers who have tried all 28 Flavours become an FBB groupie or something like that! Congrats Fab Boy and team 
2
When making reservations, we made sure they would be able to accommodate my mom's celiac disease. We got there and they were not serving gluten free bread today. Strike one. Ordered her the hash. It was so gristly she couldn't eat it. Strike two. We're used to restaurants in Singapore serving people at different times, but between the first and fourth person at our table being served was about a 10-minute gap. Strike three. The French toast, although a delicious concept, was sooooo oily and so sugary that we could hardly eat it. Strike four. We will not come here again. My pancakes were pretty good! And unlike most places in SG, they gave us an abundance of syrup! Redeeming quality number one!
4
The hummingbird cake is perfectly spiced, soft and not too sweet. Eggs ben was perfectly poached although the brioche was a little bit on the dry side but the hollandaise sauce covered that well.
3
A nice cafe which is quite crowded but lucky we can reserve. Wanted to try pancakes but they ran out of it so early! ( it was only around noon)
4
Casual brunch place with good food. A bit crowded. Service could be better. Eggs benny were good but yogurt was disappointing
5
Whenever I am in Singapore, I make it a point to visit the FabulousBaker Boy. This time I took my colleagues after the end of our meetings. We had the carrot, red velvet, lemon vanilla and a chocolate devils cake slice. Very nice and filling.
4
A quaint place, located near Clarke Quay. The staff was very helpful in recommending dishes according to our preference. The presentation of their food is on point and I only hoped that the Prive could be slightly cheaper.
4
Food was great, delicious, especially the salad bowl which was huge as well even tho its a starter, however waited very long for the food, more than 30min
4
Staff was friendly, and food was delicious! Will recommend this place to people who want a quiet place for dinner.
5
We made last minute reservation for brunch on a Saturday noon. Super glad we managed to get a table as both Hubs and I wanted to try their 'Fab Fry' - a plate full of greasy goodness that won't disappoint! Hubs doesn't eat pork so he was very happy to hear they could swap the bacon for more lamb sausages. 'Fab Fry' is enough to fill you up for the entire day and is worth every single cent of the $25. If you are a small eater, you may want to share this plate 'cause even we were defeated
5
Set in the foothills of Fort Canning and right across the taxi point of Clark Quay, this cafe is a gem of a find. Early evenings is a blissful time to try their famous cakes and coffee that has a good punch. Dont get fooled by how the cakes look, they taste amazing. We tried carrot and chocolate cake
3
The Fabulous Baker Boy is located just opposite Liang Court, at the Foothills of Fort Canning Park. It is a wonderful place to hang out and chill with friends, especially in the afternoons/evenings. The food though, has much to be desired. Went there in the evening for dinner and got the Chilli Crab Mac & Cheese. The first few mouthfuls were great but I soon got bored of it.I heard their cakes are good, so will be coming back to try their cakes some other time in the afternoons to have tea with friends :
4
The highlight was the food both times we went. Highly recommend the french toast! Service was acceptable. No lines to get in which was great for us, walking in the first time with 12 people.
4
A sweet place with nice vibe. The crew was lean but the staff were lovely. Eggs Benedict was well executed. Coffee and cake were yummy. Other dishes (e.g. tuna melt) were so-so. Good for brunch or afternoon tea.
2
Sad to say I don't think I will be back here. There is a very limited menu, service isn't good, very difficult place to find.
4
The cakes are very delicious and we loved the fish and chips and duck confit. Service was fantastic too!
4
Slightly updated menu. Still good food. Service is sometimes slow, but if you're not in a rush, it's fine.
3
Highly understaffed on a Sunday morning for brunch. Trainee waitress was quite blur and lack of can-do attitude. Food is good but not cheap either. Table keeps rolling due to rollers underneath. Cake is expensive. And no available parking!
4
was there on a sunday morning for breakfast at 9 am. staffs are friendly and service was good . bit limited choice for breakfast but the what we had was decent and not bad for the price you pay for . environment - cosy and nice , but i think when it gets too busy it might be bit noisy due to the space. suggest to go really early for breakfast if you like a quiet and green environment facing out of the caf
4
It's my second visit and the standards have been kept up. Just a simple lunch with a couple of friends, one of whom is a cake fiend. So in order to save space for dessert, we shared 2 mains - fish & chips (crispy batter, flaky white fish, cant ask for more) and chicken pot pie (there is a slight twist to this as its cooked "Melayu Style". The puff pastry on top goes well with the sauce, kinda like how roti prata goes with curry).We also shared 2 cakes, which i cant remember the names of but one is the red velvet with cream and the other grapefruit. Red velvet was moist and perfect, grapefruit was abit tart (expected!).It was a pleasant experience overall. Service was good, though there was a delay in the pot pie. At least they were honest enough to say they burnt the first one :
5
I've always loved the cakes here and it was great to see they've further expanded their selection! I tried the Beyonce (lemon-y goodness!) and the black sesame. Both really rich in flavour yet the sponge cake was light in texture. Although location is a bit random but it's worth it as it's a nice oasis in the middle of the city. Service is good too
4
Arrived at our booking at 4pm on a Sunday and was told that they had only cakes left. Apparently they only serve breakfast until 230pm on Sundays (take note!) and dinners are only served on Friday and Saturday evenings. We tried the 'Luna' since we had less than an hour. The staff were very welcoming, friendly and even recommended ways on consuming the cake to truly enjoy the 'experience'. Explained to us their operating timings and peak periods. Would definitely be back for their brunch and more delicious cakes!
4
The cakes name are so special. The food is delicious. Services still need improvement and can see the staffs is trying hard to complete the order as soon as possible. Good environment and ambience.
5
Dropped in for coffee and pastry late afternoon. We were made most welcome and even though the kitchen was closed we enjoyed some lovely pastries and a sensational coffee. Lovely lovely lovely.
5
Visited this morning before trip to Fort Canning Park. Was welcomed at the door and shown to a seat. Had an almond croissant just out of the oven, amazing! Also had a coffee, very good standard. Great venue, great service, go there for breakfast!
3
I've been here many times but my latest visit was the worst. The restaurant was understaffed and there was a long wait for everything. Food is average and cakes are overpriced. Stick to pancakes and avoid their waffles.
4
The mains were pretty normal but the cakes were the stars. You will be spoilt for choice just trying to decide which to eat. We had the varlhona choc cake and the fab red velvet and both were delish!
5
Staff was friendly and helpful. Went there for a farewell lunch with a group of colleagues. As it's lunch and some of them are late due to meetings, they offered to prepare the food and keep it in the oven for us.
4
Despite the shortage of manpower on a crowded Saturday evening, the staff remained friendly & patient, food served quick & good, and Chope discount is a bonus! Love its location situated in the park. I had the spicy fried chicken w waffle & enjoyed it! Sad that the duck confit was alrdy sold out in the afternoon...looking fwd to try it!
5
Service was mediocre, quite understaffed for a Saturday dinner. Would be good to make a reservation, must have their cakes! Several items from menu were not available for dinner as they ran out, but overall experience was still great. Slightly overpriced, we spent about $180 for 6 people, and did not order any drinks. Each of us had a main, and we shared a plate of fries and two slices of cakes.
5
Had sneaky afternoon cake here for my wife's birthday in this pleasant converted pavilion. We couldn't have been made to feel more welcome - the baker himself took us through the cakes available and was the friendliest guy ever!The cakes themselves were delicious - I can't remember all that we had, but the chocolate, carrot and red velvet varieties were memorable highlights. The coffees were fantastic to match. Highly recommend
2
This place is located in a corner of a former Swimming pool in Singapore and at the foot of Fort Canning Hill.It was packed on a Saturday afternoon that we were here but without the need to wait for tables.Carrot cake was relatively tasty (and expensive - around $9.50++), although my Friend thought that Cedele's was better with bigger chunks of walnuts.The big disappointment was the expensive small cuppa flat white (at $6.50 excluding service charge and GST) which tasted burnt and did not have any latte art at all (which is a hallmark of any decent barista). It was also a tad scalding hot.All in all, Come for the cake (the name probably more than hints at this) but avoid coffee.
3
It's tucked away among the greenery in front of Liang Court so is not the most convenient of places to dine at. The setting is casual, though they have a most unique carrot cake. Worth a visit if in the area.
4
Food was good, service was good, location is a little off the grid but with ample signages. Music was also good throughout the dinner. Only downside is that the food is a little pricey.
3
Ambience was good, service was very nice, cakes look fabulous... but taste is disappointing. We got the red velvet and the Pandan one. In our opinion red velvet was too dry :(
4
Good food, service and atmosphere :)
nice place to meet up with friends, away from noisy and packed cafe's.
4
Food is good. They have a huge variety of cakes and they were also pleasing to the eyes and palate. A place to go for nice cakes and a heart to heart talk.
5
We went to The Fabulous Baker Boy for coffee and cake. Did not disappoint what we had read about this place. Cakes were to die for and staff could not have been more friendly. Selection of cakes and all food was wide and varied. Location is in Fort Canning Park on River Valley Road opposite Clark Quay. Opens at 11am and does not open on Mondays. Highly recommend you will not be disappointed
3
My 4th time here and the food didn't disappoint as usual. Brought parents here thinking to enjoy the quiet ambience amongst such lush greenery for a bit but it was really noisy. Can't blame them for the crowds though... But service was quite slow as well... highly unlikely to come here again on a weekend aftn 
4
I visited the restaurant on a very rainy Sunday and was pleasantly surprised by the lack of people. Based on other reviews, I had expected a crowd. The location is nice, right alongside Fort Canning Park. I had the grilled cheese with chicken for $13. The plate came with a side salad and the sandwich was quite large. The cheese was very good, but the chicken didn't add much to the dish. In the future I will only order the grilled cheese. Staff was polite and attentive. There seems to be some confusion from other diners on where to pay. You pay at the counter. It would be a good idea for the staff to mention this when they drop the bill at the table. I saw two different tables waiting an extended period of time for someone to pick up their bill. Besides that, everything was good
4
I took my in laws here for brunch and we all loved it. The food was amazing- esp the mac and cheese and the special cinnamon cream cheese pancakes- which i order every time i go! Amazing variety of cakes to choose from. We will be back to try more flavours@

Looks can be deceiving. Cakes looked only ok ok, however the taste was wonderful. Tried the strawberry yogurt cake, Hossan chocolate cake and lemon raspberry cake. Looked average but packed with flavour and texture. Steaks and fries also tasted wonderful, though not sure the added salad with the steaks and fries had any part on the dish. Lamb shank was nicely prepared, soft and tender though the mashed tasted even better. Worth another visit to check out the other cakes
5
Beautiful delicious cakes you can see being made.
Some food was good. Some dishes were average (eggs were bizarrely sour). Good area for kids to run around outside (hot and unshaded though if lunch time) but nowhere to park at the location
3
Lunch items was good but the cake was lower than my expectations. A little pricey overall but if you like a quiet place for lunch or tea than it's a place to go cos it's not crowded.
5
Great place, decent food and pretty good attentive customer service! If you have a sweet spot for cakes, this will be your wonderland!
5
Really enjoyed the lemon slice cake! Totally recommended and the fab ice tea tea was a refreshing earl grey tea!
4
Food was standard fare, did not take too long to be served. Cakes were pretty expensive. Staff were prompt and attentive. Will visit again.
3
Overall expensive for a cafe.
What's good: tuna melt sandwich & blueberry pancakes
Average: mocha, flat white and latte, and the ju prawn pasta.
Way Too sweet: Jacintha pandan cake & the carrot cake
5
The cafe is nicely hidden and we love it! The Fabulous Baker Boy offer about a dozen mouth-watering cakes. It took us 20 mins to decide on which to indulge. But that's not the best part. The best part of our dining experience was their Duck Confit. The crispy duck sat nicely on a bed of mash potatoes surrounded by caramelized onions. Its been 3 days and i still dream of it. We did had their Fish & Chips. Portion was generous, it was not heavily battered unlike some restaurant serves where you discover how small the filet are. Definitely making a second visit for their cakes and of course that Duck Confit!
4
They have a super wide range of cakes selection, much much more than other cafes...but the price is abit on high end side.. ranges from SGD9 to SGD12... I tried Valrhona Chocolate Cake - nice with rich chocolate taste, smooth and soft.. Another one is Diva Series : Ms Katy Perry, the cake itself is smooth and moist, but they added a lot of crunchy stuffs on it, causing the cake a little too dry.. I have to sweep away all the crunchy stuff to enjoy the cake..
4
Environment was good and cafe was not packed so was able to have quite a good time catching up with my friends. Would recommend having bday celebrations or any group catch up here. The main course we order was fish & chips and fried chicken with waffles. While the cakes we ordered were nutty monkey, chocolate caramel and Tina turner. Cakes were delicious and it's definitely a must try! There are also many flavours to choose from. Would definitely come back again for the cakes
3
Reached at 11.05am. Ordered at 11.17. By 12.15, there were still 2 breakfast sets and our fries not served. (To be fair We checked with them and breakfast were served while 10min) The food are ok & grear cakes but there are definitely room for improvement in the waiting time.
5
This was our 2nd time here! 1st was for dinner, this time for Sunday brunch. Really great food and fabulous cakes! Highly recommend! And will definitely be back :)
5
After a nice walk in Fort Canning Park this is the perfect place to have tea or coffee. And to make the experience complete, choose one of the delicious cakes. You can take another walk after this.
4
good ambience but abit far from carpark. the food is great and the service is good even though we are we're quite late
5
Lovely Friday afternoon with friends, great ambience, deliciously fabulous food and the door stopper cakes. Out of this world, thank you for a fabulous lunch
5
The house grilled cheese. So simple yet so satisfying. Have had each time I've been and always so good. Not to mention the pancakes! And cake! Love the place.
3
Loved the environment... I was there during tea time and the cafe wasn't exactly packed. We had quite a relaxing time chilling there, and the coffee was good. However I find that the cakes are too sweet. I wonder how much sugar there is in a single slice. Would be good if they can explore into baking healthier cakes..
4
We went on a Sunday morning and the crowd was there. As such, it took 45 min for our food to be served. While the food was good, I think the service may have been slightly better had the service crew checked on our food instead of simply notifying us that there's a long backlog and dismissing us with that line. It kind of made us feel that they were just saying for the sake of saying it.
1
Salad was not fresh, leaves were turning yellow and some were bruised. The Fab Baker himself insisted the salad WAS fresh and I showed him the rotten leaves that I had pulled out and he insisted was the heat that destroyed the leave, true, but how come bad leaves were not near the cooked mushrooms..? Had a bad cramps and tummy ache soon after. Shall not go back unless it's to walk in the park. The cakes were dry and mediocre. Won't recommend :(
2
We were looking for a quaint brunch spot for our first weekend in Singapore and this cafe at the foot of fort canning seemed to fit the bill. However the food was not very good. The coffee was very bitter and the milk was not adequately steamed. The break was over cooked and hard ... Almost like a cracker. Overall a bad experience. Nice ambianc
4
We had main course each with a piece of cake, The cake is that kinda simple close to traditional type with a a few same layers which happens to be all my all time favorite, not creamy at all which is a bonus. I had the one that is earl grey, and very please that you can taste pretty good quantity of earl grey. The main course is ok to me. I pretty much enjoy the waffles. I had the fried chicken with waffles. Fried chicken doesnt catch my attention as much as the waffle. Its light waffles and go very well with the syrup and butter, its like the syrup butter and waffle are matchmake! It taste light throughout. My friend had the curry chicken pie, interesting kinda curry that you dont find in the usual chicken curry, will love to eat that when its pouring or when the weather is chilly!
4
I really recommend the chicken pot pie - great pastry! Comfort food especially on a cold rainy day. As for the cakes.. fabulous baker indeed!
5
Location is a bit off but unique, the swings out there in the lawn is great for kids. Food is great, tried BBQ beef grilled cheese and waffles this time, food never disappoints
4
I love their Apple cider waffle and Luna cake. Nice place to chill and have gathering with your friends! Will go back again to try other cakes.
4
Attended an art exhibition at the spare room and had some coffee, tea and cakes with friend while we were there. Many good cake choices and will take many visits to try them all!
4
Went there the cakes was not bad but could be colder if kept in the fridge. Price reasonable for a big slice.
5
I don't know how Juwanda and his team do it - exceptional cakes with quirky names linked to their ingredients, and awesome food at a great price. They renovated the place to be bigger with an art gallery on the side. The venue is very green and idyllic despite the central location. A fixed art piece "DREAM" is just outside (similar moveable piece located at the National Museum) along with colourful swings.For the price, don't expect to be waited on hand and foot. And the food appears to be made fresh so there will be some waiting time. Service is brisk and professional but do have an understanding when there are limited staff on hand. At 7.50 for a stack of 3 pancakes - well-browned outside while soft and fluffy inside - it is a steal compared to most other cafe-ish place
3
Great restaurant and have been there before a few times and love the food and location. Unfortunately one has no choice now but to book through Chope (wonder why a restaurant cannot allow reservations directly). Made the next mistake of falling for Chope's marketing of online vouchers. Couldnt encase these to the extent required and Chope doesn't believe in refunds. Am stuck with having to find a alternative and mandatorily use Chope again! And when trying to do so found that most of the leading restaurants are not even partnering with them. What kind of service doesn't allow refund of your money for a service that does not work!
5
My husband and I visited The fabulous baker boy for his birthday and it was lovely experience. The cakes are huge and soo tasty. There are so many options you can choose from so I was honestly confused haha. The staff even put a candle on my husband's piece as I mentioned in the reservation form that it's his birthday. Lovely place!

If you have a food allergy steer clear of this place. I went for lunch with my wife whose food arrived 20 minutes before my dish. When the dish finally arrived, it contained sn ingredient which I am allergic to. The ingredient was not included in the menu description and it was only througn luck that I noticed it.When I alerted the waitress, she took the dish away and came back imform me that they would scrap the ingredient off and return the dish. I was shocked and told her clearly that any trace would be harmful. I asked to see the owner who then walked over after he'd continued serving four customers.He then offered to cook a fresh meal which would take another 30 mins. I politely refused and escaped after having the pleasure of paying for half a lunch and an hour-lomg wait. If you have any food allergies dont go there
5
We ate both breakfast and dinner here on different days. The staff are extremely friendly. Choose from fresh baked goods and lovely meals. Not open until 11am, but worth the wait. Air conditioned and relatively small, the room is both functional and simple. This one is slightly harder to find but it is near Clarke Quay. Lovely!
4
Good venue for an informal business meeting over coffee and cakes. Reservation was smooth, service excellent.
5
Grilled cheese sandwich - so simple but so good. Pancakes were fluffy, bursting with blueberries. And of course the cakes, sooooo good!
5
The ambience was great and so were the foods. We were served by a very attentive and helpful service crew. During our meal they even came to us to make sure that everything was fine for us! Will definitely revisit.
4
Food is always good, cakes are delicious, but service can get slow during peak hours. Go early to have a quieter experience.
4
Went there for a weekend brunch, and the mains were alright (eggs ben was good, but the chilli crab mac & cheese was a little disappointing). Nonetheless their chocolate cake was really amazing, the perfect way to end our meal :)
4
This place is located at the foot of Fort Canning. You can follow the directions of Google map but will end up circling the place as there is no parking facility. The best way is to turn inside the mall opposite this place and park there. We were there for cakes. Interesting selection.
4
We went for lunch on a Saturday,reserved a table which was good because the place filled up.Atmosphere is nice although the welcome doorbell a little annoying if you're sitting near the door.Food was very tasty and the portion size very big. We had a tuna melt and the new chicken pot pie. Only downside was about 30min wait for food. Otherwise all good
4
Really a 4 1/2. Pure delivious gluttony. The pancakes are very close to Western style pancakes. The Sweet as Cynth pancakes are to die for, not what you would expect, only served on the weekend. Chicken & waffles are yummy too....tasty crispy waffle, nice crispy chickenn, but a bit greasy and not boneless.Overall experience was WONDERFULLY delicious!!!!
5
Not my 1st time here but is my mum's and she's really impressed with the blackforest gateau as well as the straits chai tea recommended by the crew! Felt good too seeing her enjoy her time there and singing or humming along to some of the music. She loved the experience a lot! Thank you
3
I have eaten here several times - it should be great - and when it is, it is, but the consistency is just not there. I have twice now had cake that is dried out (this is their specialty)....dry bread for the grilled cheese. Service can be spot on or frightfully slow and inattentive. It's a lovely location and as I mentioned when you get it on a good day it is great
3
Environment is nice but food is average. Nearest carpark is Liang Court which is quite far also. Need 10 mins walk to the restaurant.
5
Food is so delicious, cake is so good and so many variety of cakes! And also the staffs is so friendly and nice!
5
Service was great and prompt. Food was delicious with reasonable price.
Will definitely recommend to my friends.
4
First time here and the main courses and cakes are yummy!! A good place to chill as it's a little bit away from the city as well 😊
5
Great on dates, cute decor. She's guaranteed to live it and give you a good time. Foods alright too.
1
I found something that looked like part of a caterpillar in the salad after having eaten 3/4 of the sandwich. The staff came and took that leaf away, and then told me it's a wasp nest instead! He offered to give me back the same dish. But I refused coz I've lost my appetite. The restaurant actually charged me in full for the sandwich when the bill came. I asked him, "Really?!!". Then he offered a 10% discount for the 'little inconvenience' (those where his exact words) coz I've eaten some of the sandwich, and even asked me if I expected it to be free!!! They've examined it and decided it's only part of a caterpillar now, not a wasp nest! I said I'd be kind to even pay him half. He said 50% would be impossible and offered me a 20% discount at most. I can't believe that he even told me seriously, 'At least it's organic." Should I report this restaurant to the authorities
3
Went for lunch, and was seated at a table near the window. The interior is simple, yet nice with the greens in front of the building.This place is famous for its cakes, so it seemed looking at the wide variety of cakes being stalled at the large table.I went for the eggs benedicte with smoked salmon, my friend for the fabulous pancakes.I was surprised of my dish, small portion with patotoes instead of a nice salad, which I personally prefer. My friend was very happy with her huge stack of fluffy pancakes, drizzeled with with cream sauce.So maybe they are better at their sweets, rather than their savory dishes
5
The special thing about the fabulous baker boy is that the savoury stuff as well as the cakes are excellent. Usually when you go to a cafe either the desserts are good and the mains not so much or vice versa. This place has the best of both worlds. My little one especially enjoys playing on the swings outside cafe
5
We came here for the bimonthly event "telling stories live", where storytellers share the memorable events and intimate details about their lives.I had a cheesy beef sandwich, which was really, really good. Soft toasted home made bread with melty cheesy beef chunks into between; I dare say this is one of the best beef sandwich I had
2
Place was noisy with lots of kids. Service staff were very attentive and attended to us (3pax) promptly. However, the food took a long time to come..about one hour. Our coffee wss served to us after several reminders...30mins after they took our orders. Each time we asked, they said its coming and then its forgotten...and we asked again and its forgotten again. Finally it came and we got the wrong coffee. I noticed that we are not the only ones who got served the wrong coffee. Another patron had to help himself with the plates and cutlery. They are not able to handle the orders with 3 service staff. Would i come back again? Only if it is empty.
4
We've almost made a sort of ritual coming here after our morning walks on the weekend. I wanna try every single cake they have there! They all look so tempting 💕
4
food is acceptable and nice ambience. Have a good selection of cakes however we didn't try this time. Maybe will go back again to try the cakes.
4
FBB is our all time favourite brunch place coz of their cakes & egg benny. Please change those ikea stools they r really uncomfortable to sit & puts strain on legs
4
Cafe was not cool enough for a hot weather in the afternoon at 4pm. Plz turn on the aircon. Drinks and cakes are
Awesome
4
Cakes are a little too sweet n the coffee needs much improvement to go with the yummy cakes.
Lunch was half late as kitchen wasn't ready. Would really be a nice gesture if they could offer us a hot drink while we wait.
5
Great meal , food was damm shiok and delicious ! We had the croque monsieur , Big Ben , waffles with chicken and Two cakes ! All finger licking good .. plate empty liao
4
The place is really popular on Saturday morning, please make sure you make a reservation online. Blueberry pancakes are delicious! Fresh blueberry and soft pancakes. Good food!
5
Visited this quiet cake on the edge of the park twice. Excellent service and good food but the range of gateaux is superb, all named after celebrities.'Diana Ross' was delicious. At a quick count there were 17 different cakes the date visite
4
It is conveniently located at the foot of Fort Canning (just opposite Liang Court) and walking distance from CQ MRT. There is a little park on front of the restaurant, good for couples to continue their romance on the swing chairs. The waiter and waitress leave you alone most of the time, so that you can have a decent date. The food is so awesome but beware that the portion is quite huge. The cakes selection are so much that it was hard to choose since our stomach can only eat so much. If only they have samplers
5
This cafe is slightly off the main road inside fort canning park but it is worth trying. They have a lovely ambience, the menu is mixed with western items like pancakes (their blueberry pancakes are amazing) as well as more local dishes (the chicken kampung pie is really good too).They have lots of fresh cakes (not trued those yet but i will!) and very good coffee too
5
Awesome pancakes. Even better cakes. Made for a great catch up between long time friends to ring in the new year :)
4
The signature red velvet cake was delightful. Ordered the traditional beef hash but it wasn't worth the price.
3
Visited this cafe with a group of friends. Places was quite inaccessible with all the construction work going on. Cafe was enclosed l hence its a little noisy inside.
5
A place to unwind away from city life. A place where u can dine in comfort. After dinner, swing away ur thoughts.
3
We order Steak & Fries and Triple Cheese Cajun Chicken Sandwich. The steak is average, while the chicken is served bits size. Not value for money for the quality of food served.
3
Portion of the food was generous but the taste is slightly blend.
Overall ambience is good and staff is attentive.
5
Tried Champion breakfast and Croque Monsieur, and really like their toast! The toast is relatively thinner but just because of that it absorbs the flavors better, and it also has a very pleasany crunchiness. The cakes looks good, but as I'm too full from breakfast, didn't get to try them. Overall the ambience is very nice, bright and relaxing, great brunch spot
5
Very relaxed atmosphere. staff are attentive and friendly. The cafe is rather spacious and open and the seats at the sides are extremely comfortable, giving you a view of the outside. Food serving is huge and definitely super value for money. Will be coming back again
4
Although I've had a sampling of the brunch menu, I am a huge fan of the cakes. As a foodie himself, fab baker Juwanda doesn't compromise on taste and ingredients. I have a soft spot for Big Lub Carrot Cake and the red velvet cupcakes. That being said, sides like the garlic fries are quite nice as well
4
Went on a Sunday. Crowded and noisy but in a good way. Lovely place to people watch and have some bistro food.Kid had the grilled cheese toast and it was extremely delicious. Simple and well executed. The fish and chips were okay. The fried chicken and waffles hit the spot! We had a tiny issue with a non threatening foreign object in the chilli crab mac and cheese but it was efficiently resolved by the staff and manager! Great and friendly service!Kids will love the swings on the park grounds and Liang Court is just opposite for some walking after all the heavy food! Or can climb Fort Canning
4
Were seated very promptly and the food were in really generous portions and tasted great! Best was the really friendly crew who reconmended us this and that and had a nice chat too after our meal!
4
Quality of food is good and love the place. Parking is easy and plenty of space for kids to run around in the park. The cakes are a must-try with many varieties!
5
The Fabulous Baker Boy never disappoints for brunch, lunch, tea or dinner.
Remember to always leave space for the most delicious cakes!
4
The food is reasonably priced and alright, but what is truly remarkable are the cakes. These are some of the best I've had and of really good quality.
5
I've been to The FBB a couple of times and even recently held my birthday there! This time I had the chicken pot pie and the serving was HUGE and it was delicious. Ambience was amazing as usual and the cake we took away for a friend's birthday was awesome - Nutty Monkey I think it was
3
We stopped here for coffe whilst walking in Fort Canning Park and I was very happy to find GF cake which was delicious. There were 3 choices of GF cake so I was very impressed. However, the service was very slow - it took 15 mins to get a coffee, a tea and a slice of cake when there were only two other tables occupied and served already. The girl did not get on with our order but seemed to be on her phone. Anyway, later in the day we decided to go back and try a meal. It was only 6 oclock and there were no other customers, we felt a bit uncomfortable. As I had had GF cake I thought the meals would also be GF friendly. But no, I had to make do with a salmon salad - a bowl of green leaves with 4 small pieces of smoked salmon draped across for 14 dollars. My husbands meal was very small and not worth the price. very disappointing considering the cakes are so amazing
4
Went there with high hopes on the bakery goodies with a full brunch in mind. Ordered the cajun chix toastie, fish bites(can't remb the name) and drinks. Assumed the fish bites will be cafe-sized; we were wrong! It came sized like a main course, and it's delicious!Chunks of dory fully stuffed within herb and spiced-crust, flavourful with tinges of zing filling the palate, with accompanying sauce a good companion for a change of flavours.Chix toastie was, personally, a letdown as the thick toast(done to near perfection however) size overwhelmed the very little cheese contained within. Expect disciplined portions of cheese all hidden within the slices of bread and some sprinkling of chicken bits.Flat white we ordered was robust, full-bodied and aromatic. Teas were off-the-shelf Gryphon, with around 6 choices in the menu. Decent variety for both choice of beverage.The cakes however took the limelight, with what we counted physically to be around 16 types available on a Sunday. Jacintha(gula melaka, pandan, cream cheese) was awesome in the fine pandan fragrance department, smooth decadent cream(could do with a thicker layer) covered a side of my slice.Carrot cake was moist enough, chunky enough, and rich aromas from the ingredients filled the nose everytime it was brought near for a mouthful.Can't wait to go back for more cakes! Prices were high, but for the cakes and the fish bites, worth it.Tends to get noisy past 12pm, and hugely popular it seems, with families and kids. No outdoor sitting available from what we have seen
1
It took them a long time to serve the 2 cups of overpriced sourish espresso and 1 earl grey tea on a weekday morning with only 2 patrons in the cafe. It cost us a whooping $21. We overheard the patrons from the next table was reminding the staff to serve their food. My friends are not comfortable in having the cake in a garlic filled air, we left without finishing our drin
5
We found this place by coincidence and were lucky to get a table, as most were already reserved in advance.(ensure you book ahead so you def get a seat). We came for lunch and had great food and friendly service, but I would def recommend to make sure you come here hungry, as you must try some of their fantastic cakes as well. You can watch cakes being made and decorated in the bakery section at the front of the cafe
5
A very welcoming airy cafe style restaurant with good service and fantastic cakes. We had 2 lunch main's between 3 of us (you want to leave room for the cake!) Many of the cakes were music themed - we especially enjoyed the Katy Perry and Tina Turner cakes. Throughly recommend it.
3
Everything seems ok ,the slice of the cake is a bite small compare to other cafe but with the $10 is worth.
5
I went there for the cakes and it was not a disappointment. I had the Black Forest Cake and Matcha Shortcake. Sweetness was just nice. The service was efficient and attentive.
4
many cake selections but some are not available just every day. the food was good. shepherd's pie was to our liking with good fries. just a little tad ex. and parking is ambiguous.
5
One of my favourite cafe with great food and cakes! Never disappointed with the amazing choices of cakes and a great brunch option as well.
1
Food was mediocre. Ordered a Cajun chicken sandwich, no choice of different bread, chicken was just a few small cubed pieces, and sandwich was overly buttered. Waiter had a poor sour cafe the whole time, no smile and felt almost as if he wasn't happy that we were there at all. It completely spoilt the lovely garden setting.
4
Service staff was superb and friendly, and provided suggestion on what to order. Though the chicken came a little 'bloody', which we were informed that it was quite normal, service crew changed the entire plate for us, and restaurant manager was so sweet to give us a complimentary cake for our unpleasant experience with the chicken. Thumbs up for impecable service. Would definitely be back to try out the other items on the food menu. Keep up the great work FBB! :
1
Made a booking for 5 pm early pre show dinner 3 weeks in advance. Two hours before the booking I got a call to let me know that kitchen would not be open till 6. This of course left no time to reschedule with all my mates. The compromiser was a snack menu which the waiter offered over the phone. Once we got there, even that was not available as they've run out! The waiter hearing our complaints had 'what do you want ME to do about it?' attitude. So we left. Been there before and raved about the food. Service equally important and this experience will mean me giving the place a wide berth in the future.
3
This cafe is known for its cakes, but peculiarly enough, I enjoyed the coffee a lot more than the cake! We tried a cold and a hot latte on a weekday evening, along with a slice of the Pumpkin-Pretzel cake. The coffee was creamy and delicious. The cream cheese frosting on the cake was terrific but the cake itself was a tad low on moistness and flavour. However, considering the variety of cake they have, I'll probably return to sample more
5
When i first visited this place 2 years ago. I wasn't expecting the selection of cakes to be that huge. Man....i was struggling for choices. End up settle for Carrot cake which was wonderfully delicious & value for $. Also tried the blueberry lemon yoghurt. These 2 was instantly was added to my favourite list. Till now i still order at least 1 of these whenever i drop by. The service was great too & cleanliness was well kept. Overall i would give a 5 star rating for this place. Keep it up you Fabulous bunch of people!Jimm
5
Have been many times for dinner and the food , ambiance and staff never fail to deliver. Very friendly attentive staff and food very tasty and perfectly prepared and presented. The fantastic array of cakes are a must !! We took home one of Ju's new brioche loaf , so we continued the 'fabulous' experience the next morning for breakfast , highly recommended. We will be back , thank you again for a great meal.
5
Love everything about the restaurant from the food, ambience and the service. I have been there twice!
4
The place has a nice ambience especially in the evening for small gatherings. Food is great and freshly prepared. The cakes are indeed fabulous!
5
The food are delicious! My friends and I love the garlic fries with truffle mayonnaise! The staff are friendly and approachable too! The restaurant may be small and it's cozy. :)
5
I heard here offers very good cakes but there foods are also good, tasty.
I tried fish and chips. it's good.
5
Fab location and even better cakes! He held our sons blessing cermony there and the team delivered and went the extra mile.
5
The servers are friendly and attentive.Food is delicious and there is quite a variety of food on their menu.Of course, their cakes are a must-have! With a selection of more than 20 cakes, you will be spoilt for choice. Their cakes are moist and full of flavour (
5
Originally thought about going for the cakes (which they have an amazing selection of), but started out with lunch. Really awesome selection of Western fare. Was mindful not to fill up on the lunch to save room for CAKE. The service was wonderful; you can tell the staff really enjoys sharing their love for all things goodness
3
Serving all day breakfast menus . Would say it is fairly edible but ain't fantastic . For the price and location, I would say is not worth the travel to that cafe . Nothing special and nothing fantastic out or i
5
The Fabulous Baker Boy had a really nice quiet ambience for dinner. Really enjoyed the quiet setting nestled near Fort Canning Hill. The service staff served us with a smile. Food-wise, we especially loved the garlic fries and the cakes! They were simply heavenly. I would definitely come back here again for a quiet dinner and enjoy a glass of wine to wind down after a hard day's work. Thank you for the wonderful first time experience TFBB! =
5
If you're tired of getting your cakes slices served with that plastic wrap that hints at mass production, then head to Fabulous Baker Boy. Here, chef Juwanda makes good old fashioned cakes that ooze homemade magic! Expect quality ingredients, innovative flavours, stunning presentation and pure sugar bliss. Not to be missed are the Californian Apple Stacker, Lady Marmalade, Caribbean Lemon and the Red Velvet Cake. The bright and chilled-out cafe also serves a variety of savory snacks and dishes at meal times
4
We went there for a Saturday brunch. Nice location (located just below Fort Canning park), nice ambiance, nice food. We had a very pleasant morning that day
5
The Location, the Food was Fantabulous esp the Eggs Benny (very good and most of all the servers/waiters were polite & friendly. My mum, sister n my daughter enjoyed the lunch.
5
Great Chill out environment nestled in Fort Canning Park. Food was excellent and very reasonably, Been here many times, just love the HUGE PERFECT POACHED EGGS, only available on Sunday Brunch....
5
We've been eating at Fabulous Baker Boy since we discovered this little gem 2 years ago. My wife and I went for a late unch yesterday (Saturday). Both our meals were superb. My wife enjoyed her Pot of Tea, and my Flat White coffee was excellent. Not to mention the Chocolate cake that we split for dessert. :) Highly recommend FBB for a great atmosphere, top class food and it's all very well priced.
4
We were absolutely impressed by how Ju beautifully customised a Red and White Theme Birthday cake for my sister! Thanks Ju and staff who made this surprise possible. We loved the generous toppings of fresh strawberries and raspberries and the little icing flowers details on the cake, cake was of good moisture with chunky macadamia nuts filled with raspberries compote, it is probably the best customised cake that we ever had! We are still thinking about the cake till today!
5
Cakes are awesome especially the carrot cake , every layer is moist with a mouthful of creamcheeseYou will be spoilt for choice when you see all the amazing cakes at the counter.Another must have is the chicken and waffles!!! sounds weird? wait till you try it and you will never see waffles just with chocolate and ice-cream :
5
A friendly bistro with Awesome Cakes to die for. They too serve homey & comfy food for lunch and dinner that make you feel relax. It's a place for cozy time with chummy friends and family.Situated at the bottom of Fort Canning hill, makes it an ideal stopover or an after dinner stroll with your love one, maybe returning to get one of the awesome cake to bring home - to make your day ;-)
5
Ordered the 11" chocolate caramel cake and cupcakes for a birthday party. There was absolutely nothing left despite me ordering more cake than was necessary. Everyone commented on how exceptional it was. The cake was was soft, moist, still light, and very chocolaty without being excessively sweet. The layer of sticky salted caramel took this classic to a new almost sinful level of deliciousness - really something special. Will definitely be ordering more of Juwanda's cakes
5
Super friendly and passionate staff - who really love what they do. Great food, Great coffee, Great cakes and always friendly. We are from the NY & Melbourne so we set the bar quite high in terms of cakes & coffee but this place is always our go to- especially when there are kids involved. You can tell everything is made with love
5
I ordered three large cakes, shortbread and mini quiches for a party and everything was absolutely fantastic and went down very well with my guests! Their cakes are head and shoulders above their competitors, by far! I don't know how they do it, but for a huge cake addict like myself, their sponges are perfect every time! I can fully and whole heartedly recommend The Fabulous Baker Boy not only for cakes, but for catering too.

Some of the best cakes in Singapore. Creative, refreshing, colourful and tasty. Great friendly service, gorgeous cozy place with lovely green surroundings. Great menu and coffee too!

Made early advance booking for my family of 10 with seniors and 2 adults, allocated a less than ideal seat right in the middle of restaurant where space was tight. Place could not handle multiple orders and food sent was wrong for a few of us, could be due to the simplified order form which was filled up by server. Time taken to serve was very long, an hour between first and last dish. Though overall a poor experience for us, staff was sincerely apologetic about the wrong and slow service

arrived at 11am and ordered croque monsieur with apple cider pancakes, and coffee. The staff are kind and courteous and we appreciated the good service. Food is of good quality, acceptable for a suitable leisurely brunch place. Cakes are their trademark and were creative and delicious.Seriously though, the buzzer at the door was very annoying. There should be a better way of notifying the staff when customers come in - since buzzer's presence detracts from the atmosphere, cheapening the place and preventing it from achieving its full potential. Perhaps a bell attached over the door would help this place achieve a rustic charm.Buzzer problems aside - the customer service was excellent, they were polite to apologize for missing out an order and informed us courteously when menu items were not available. Dining here was an excellent experience, and value for money

My wife's cousin from KL was in town. We asked her what she wanted to try and she said, "Somewhere with lots of cakes". So we brought her here. She was keen to try as many cakes as possible - so she ordered up a storm. Including the carrot cake and lemon cake, which I had my serious doubts about - because they were both coated with coconut.All of the cakes arrived.. and were amazing. Each slice was generous, moist and modestly balanced for flavour. In fact their carrot cake, is my FAVOURITE carrot cake DESPITE being coated in coconut. My wife's cousin, who is studying to be a pastry chef, was blown away

This was a blind reservation (never been there before or heard about it) and it didn't go so well. They were out of their signature dish for brunch, the chef's special pancakes. They have eggs on the menu as sides but when we asked for them scrambled, they said they can't do that....I don't even know what to make of that. Usually scrambled eggs is what happens when you screw up every other kind of egg. That one left me speechless. Also, not very family friendly, nothing for the kids to play with inside (i had the family friendly filter on as well). Food that did come was just ok, nothing amazing
5
It is always a good experience at FBB. Great ambience, good food and the cakes are simply to die for. The service was great too! The staff that attended to me was really friendly and helpful, especially in describing the different cakes. My favourite main is the chilli crab mac & cheese, heavenly. And you'll never get bored of the cakes there! Just too many to choose from. FBB is really an awesome place to hang out with friends and I'll definitely be back again
5
The chef Juwanda is wonderful at both his desserts as well as his savouries. Ju's Prawn Pasta is a must try as are all his pot pies. On Sundays at lunch, they serve the most delicious chicken curry with a fluffy yet crispy prata. SLURP.Of course, The Fabulous Baker Boy BAKES. His cakes are all amazing and I have so much fun trying new ones whenever I visit.His Red Velvet cake is the absolute best I have ever tasted. THE BEST. Fabulous
5
Whenever I have friends or family visiting from overseas I always bring them here if we are in the area. Food is tasty and hearty, and portions are big. I'm a small eater so I always end up taking away my leftovers - I can't just leave it there, it's just too good! I still have dreams of their tuna melt. Wide selection of yummy cakes that are as nice to ogle at as they are to savour. But because they're so popular it can get crowded though, so do make a reservation if you wanna be sure of getting a table
5
We love the cakes here, but didn't expect the food to be so delicious too! The chilli crab pasta and buttermilk fried chicken on waffles are simply divine. The setting of the restaurant is just idyllic, it is so rare in Singapore to find a restaurant like this, set in a park! This is a must-visit
5
Excellent, top-class food all round at reasonable prices. Must tries: the tuna melt, Ju's prawn pasta, chilli crab mac & cheese... and just about every cake in the menu. Also a nice place in town to chill and hang out with friends, especially in the hot Singaporean weather (it's air-conditioned)...Some cons: location in town is quite secluded, might be difficult to find for those who aren't familiar with the place (Just remember that it is directly opposite Liang Court shopping mall, if you're coming by taxi or on foot; some taxis don't know), there is NO car park space (have to park in Liang Court and cross the street)... and it's only accessible via bus or walking, no train station nearby. Also not fully sheltered, so bring a brolly in case it rains...But definitely worth the inconvenience, when you try the food there, you'll know it's worth it.
5
A wide selection of cakes that made me stand for minutes in front of the display with a dilemma on which cake to choose from.. with great food and awesome people what more can i ask for..
5
What can I say. Love the beautiful made cakes and my fav, Eggs Benedict! Had a great time with friends over cakes and drinks. Wish I could try every piece of cake there!
5
One of the most memorable dishes I've had. It all started with tea and cake but couldn't resist staying on to have my dinner of Duck Confit. Loved the ambience, friendly staff who made me feel well looked after.
5
Loved the food and desserts (huge choice) that was on offer. Coffee was also good and although place was packed, service was prompt and efficient. Prices are reasonable!
5
The service is great, the staff friendly and helpful! Whenever i visit Singapore, I always stop by TFBB.... I must! The cakes always satisfy my sweet tooth craving, for sure! I've tried some of their menu items as well, and I wasn't disappointed! Getting there is easy, and the place itself is very relaxing. More so, now that they've expanded! I recommend you visit "The Fabulous Baker Boy". Your taste buds will thank you:-

Fabulous is not enough to describe the whole package that is The Fabulous Baker Boy. From the food, atmosphere and staff, everything and everyone at the cafe is nothing short of amazing. The staff are always willing to be of service and are very helpful. Especially the lively owner, never failing to make me smile whenever he (and the other staff) welcomes me in. The atmosphere is great, the overall interior design of the cafe gives a fresh but homely vibe, which is perfect for anyone that just wants to enjoy good food at a good cafe. There is no words for the food besides delicious. From the apple cider pancakes to the corn beef hash, to the wide range of cakes, sweet tooths and those who prefer savory meals will definitely be satisfied.Overall, i'm extremely satisfied with The Fabulous Baker Boy, and it definitely lives up to its name
4
The Fabulous Baker Boy is like your oldest best friend. Always reliable. Always comforting! There are so many lovely cakes to choose from (I've been so many times and still I haven't tried them all) and the food is hearty and delicious. It's tucked away from the hustle and bustle yet still smack in the middle of the city which makes it just that bit easier to get a way from it all should you need a little respite from our crazy city life! I have found myself seeking refuge from the office between meetings, stuffing my face with cake and coffee here on occasion. I have also organised parties and events here and it's always a hit with guests
5
I'm not sure where to begin with my rant about The Fabulous Baker Boy - I love this place.If you like your cakes - and food too - to be rich-flavored, then this is the place to go. His signature red velvet cake blows my mind, the cake batter is light yet the sweetness of the cream balances it out - it's by far the best red velvet cake I've had in Singapore. I'm a chocolate kind of girl so my cake favs are his Nutty Monkey, Salted Caramel, Valrhona Choc Cake and the Ms Whitney Houston from the diva series. His cakes are intensely flavored yet are light - so it makes you come back for more. The pancakes during the weekend brunch menu gives you Blueberry to Choc Chip options too. For savory dishes - I love the Tuna Melt. I usually get it with Truffle Fries and Garlic Aoli on the side. Perfect lunch indulgence. For dinner - the Ju's Prawn Pasta and the Chilli Crab Mac & Cheese are my winner. On a side note, I've known Juwanda before he's opened the cafe and one thing that carries through is his love for cooking. You can taste it in his food and that's so important. I've gone there so many times and the taste doesn't change - still rich, flavorful and uniquely Juwanda <

Checked out the place with a couple of friends who wanted to try out their famous cakes and we were not disappointed at all. FBB's staff was meticulous and offered to explain to us their wide variety of cakes despite our overzealous request to learn more about their cakes. We ordered the flourless chocolate cake and Mariah Carey in the end and every mouthful of the cake was inch perfect as the flavours were so well balanced that you wouldn't feel jerlat after eating. Ambience was good as well, with their extensive playlist playing in the background which made our time spent at the cafe even more enjoyable. FBB is indeed the go to place as not many places would offer you a nice cup of long black, a fantastic piece of cake while Ed Sheeren strumming along to your hearty conversations
4
Every other person I know who likes this place talk about breakfast, brunch or the cakes at TFBB but I like to visit in the evenings when the place is much less crowded and we don't usually have to go begging for a table (without reservations). At dusk, the charm and allure of TFBB Cafe really comes around when the whole area cools down and the fairy lights amplify a subtler and more relaxed time to chill and sip on a Bloody Mary and pick on the crab pasta or fried chicken with waffles. They are always a treat and never fail to perk up my appetite along with just the sight of the gorgeous array of cakes. That's always a hard choice and I am always torn between having the Bitter Marmalade, the Jacintha or the Sugee
5
The best comfort food ever! Must try the fried chicken and waffles, ju's prawn pasta, ALL the cakes and the coffee is amazing! Can't wait to go back
5
My 3rd trip to The Fab Baker Boy and loving it, as alway. Amazing cakes with lovely selection of teas and coffees. Cute venue, easy on the eyes. Perfect for a lazy afternoon. Friendly and helpful staffs. Will definitely be back!
5
Excellent friendly staff who were incredibly helpful. My fussy children were well pleased with the authentic tasting English food and the cakes! Scrumptious!
5
Friendly staff and super delicious food!!! The restaurants set up makes you feel at home. You can never leave without trying the cakes!
5
Cakes were excellent!
Enjoyed every bit of it and was scraping for more :)
Try the salted caramel when it's available. That's definitely my favorite.
4
I'm always spoilt for choice whenever I go to The Fabulous Baker Boy (TFBB) because I have so many favorites there! Ju's Prawn Pasta, Corn Beef Hash, Eggs Ben, Chix & Waffles, Duck Confit, Parmesan Fish Goujons, Tuna Melt, Beef BBQ Grilled Cheese, Soup du jour... This time, the 3 of us had a bowl of soup du jour (Roasted Cauliflower Potage) each and shared Ju's Prawn Pasta, Corn Beef Hash, Parmesan Fish Goujons and Chicken Pot Pie...Generous portions of flavorful choreography dancing in my mouth. I always have to make sure that I leave enough room in my stomach for cakes although the Japanese people claim that there is a 'betsubara' (separate stomach) for sweets. CAKES! An essential item to order! Only downside is that I don't get to indulge in my fave Lemon Meringue Tart most of the time because it's often SOLD OUT before I get there! But that's quickly saved by one of my other loves: Salted Caramel, Pam d'Or, Mariah Carey, Green Tea Praline, Ristretto and Classic Pear Tart. We washed down a slice of Jacintha and Nutty Monkey with robust flat white and stared at the glitzy Shanghai Dolly entrance across the road, while waiting for Fab Food Coma to kick in..

The Fabulous baker Boy is a great restaurant that I enjoy going with friends, loved ones, and or, even a solo lazy Sunday afternoon with myself. Together with a wonderful menu that offers a mixed of international recipes, it's a place I never felt bored going to with friends or hold gatherings at. Amongst the dishes I love are the waffles with fried chicken and the prawn pasta, they kept me filled with love and happiness with their generous serving and delicate touch of freshness. At times, I would just enjoy the greenery outside the restaurant, watched the world passes by with butterflies and little children having a fun day out with their parents. I had attended a few special birthday parties and class gatherings held at fabulous baker boy, the cakes that they made at the restaurant never failed to awe everyone with the variety and flavours one could find. At times, one could be lucky to find the chef baking live in the premises of the restaurant and it would inspire me to try my hand at baking one day. If you are looking for a nice sanctuary in the middle of a garden city, Fabulous Baker Boy is definitely a great place to go. Mind you, it can get busy on certain days/nights. Hence, it'd be good that you go on days/nights that it is not so crowded so that you could enjoy the exclusive service with lots of smiles. Enjoy

Fabulous Baker Boy serves up real food made from quality ingredients! Evidently seen in the wide array of cake choices. I have tasted all of the 20+ cake flavors and they are nothing like what you get at most places. Each carefully crafted and ingeniously thought out, the owner Juwanda clearly played his cards right. My all time favorites are the valrhona, apple cider, Blackforest (love this!) and sugee! All of the cakes are baked from scratch in-house and nothing comes from central kitchens. Hence the quality and taste is always consistent. On the food menu, favorites are the Corned Beef Hash, Prawn Pasta and Lamb shank! Be it brunch, Mid-day snacking or dinner, The Fabulous Baker boy is a must-go-to! Highly recommended and will always go back to
5
Love FBB!! We've been going there for years cause it feels like home. The staff are fab, the food is fresh and plentiful - you might want to share!! Nothing better than getting a pot of tea (not a cup) and a cake you know is fresh and an original recipe. The bread is also baked In-house. You can see for yourself when you're there with a glass bake room. Don't forget to wave hello when you walk by ❤
5
Great food, especially the corned beef. It has been so long since I had one so good.Truffle fries were great! Love the coffee, latte done to perfection. Love their cakes, the salted caramel cake and red velvet are a must try. Be sure to book early for your dinner, so as not to be disappointed
5
Had an afternoon brunch at this cozy place one day, and we love it! Opposite Liang Court, rested at the foothills of Fort Canning, a perfect afternoon to chill over cakes and coffee. And of course, the food is awesome!
5
Fabulous Food and also come with Fabulous Service... Garlic fries is a surprise & Duck confit is excellent but the gravy a bit salty. Love their weekend Tiramisu with a cup of Latte
5
We loved the food! We had the fish and chips and a slice of cake. The dip was excellent. Cake as well.
4
Red velvet was smooth and moist, garlic fries are good and portion shared among 4pax is etiquette, coffee decent and can be better.
4
I can't recommend this more for your weekend tete a tete! It was quiet and the service was attentive!
5
They have wide selection for cakes. It was my first time there so i askrd for recommendation. In the end i bought The Luna and New York Cheesecake. The cakes taste really good. My friend and I both like the New York cheesecake a lot.
3
Large food portions. BIG basket of fries with good garlic flavour, although less crispy than they looked. Toasted brioche that was part of our dishes was pretty much the only highlight food-wise. Potatoes that came with the eggs ben was undercooked. Coffee decent. We enjoyed browsing all the cakes available that day, our eventual choice of cake was pretty good, just not as good as we expected
4
Alittle overprice for the breakfast in my opinion. Didn't manage to try the bakes though those might be the star. I like the environment outside but it's alittle noisy indoors.
5
Experience/Atmosphere: Love the location as its away from the busy shopping centre & also the congested F&B area (eg Arab Street). However, its still very accessible by public transport. Interior design/dÃ©cor is simple yet cosy and welcoming. Service: Staffs are friendly! One of them was even sporting enough to sing a Tina Turner song when we request for itFood: Ordered 2types of sandwiches, salmon egg benedict, garlic fries, a cod fish bites (forgot the exact name of the item) & a slice of Tina Turner cake (sexy name isn't?). Preparation time is quite fast and food quality is good
5
I have heard many good things about this place but have never visited it for myself - thought it might be just a hype and a place where hipsters go to get their mandatory photo ops. But boy, was I wrong! We had the Red Velvet and the Chef's Fav pancakes and they were both SO. DAMN. GOOD. The cake was so moist and the frosting and chocolate coating had just the right amount of sweetness. One of the best RVs I've had, for sure. As for the pancakes, Oh em gee! It tasted like a hot yummy churro sans the oilyness! Cake-lovers, this is a real gem. Screw the diet and treat yourself - you will not regret it.
5
If you want fancy five star dining then this is not the place but if you want truly outstanding food and friendly service then this is the place to go. The best selection and quality of cakes I have come across in Singapore
4
The food is nice and the services is good!! Very nice place for friends gathering! Price is reasonable
4
Great Cakes. Red Velvet was good.
Large food portion. will be good for the hungry ones.
Good place to chill out from the opposite noisy Boat Quay
3
The beef and almond crusted salmon was tasty, the spinach and mash potato that accompanied the salmon were well prepared and cooked. The smoked salmon salad had the correct balance of smoked salmon and salad with the appropriate dose of sweet sour tangy sauce.
4
The food were great. Not over the top but pleasantly delicious. Will definitely come back to try others on the menu. My boys were happy with the food, the cake and the place itself. Perhaps the Chef could expand the pasta menu abit. Other than that, thumbs up! Happy kids = happy mommy

My husband loves brunch food and casual relaxed dining so we ate here for Father's Day. I must say he was impressed! He had the Champion breakfast and the portion was generous but they could've done better with the sausages which were similar to generic beef franks and was tough and dry. The eggs were perfectly poached, hollandaise was silky and flavorful,which was complimented by the creamed spinach. I had the Chilli Crab Mac and Cheese which was quite an interesting twist to a childhood favorite. I suggest they make the crab chunkier to have a better contrast in texture and not disappear into the sauce. My girls had the Fried Chicken and Waffles which was a hit! Crisp chicken skin but tender and juicy inside. I wish they gave a more generous serving of butter with the fluffy waffles and they should use real maple syrup not the cornsyrup-flavored-with-maple-kind. The Croque Monsieur was loaded with tasty turkey ham, cheesy goodness and creamy bechamel--more bechamel please! We loved the Sexy Nutty Crunch Fab Waffle which had generous portions of all things good it had my mouth doing a happy dance!We topped off with a slice of Salted Caramel cake which was a bit disappointing. I was reminded why I make my own cakes--I rarely find the satisfaction of perfectly good cake unless I make it--haha! The cake was moist and tender but the salted caramel filling didn't taste homemade and the frosting was a bland buttercream, I would prefer it was a silky ganache --then again, to each his own. Service was attentive some of the time, half the time we needed to flail our arms to get attention but they were polite and apologetic and they held my table even if I was late for my reservation so it's all good. Finding the restaurant was a bit tricky. It was a bummer that there was no parking nearby so we had to park at a mall across then walk up a footbridge to get to the restaurant. Not a pleasant task when you've got hungry cranky kids walking thru humid Singapore in the middle of a slight drizzle. Experience could've been better but, all in all a happy visit.

Ever since my fiance first tried their red velvet chocolate cake 5 years ago, she could not forget its amazing texture, but as she lived in Spain, it was extremely rare for her to try it in Singapore. It is hands down, her favorite cake, and she is an accomplished baker in her own right!I had the good fortune last week to be in Singapore, and called up the fabulous baker boy himself, and asked him if it was possible for the cake to be transported 6000 miles away in good condition. He said yes, and gave me specific packing instructions. When I went over there, he personally took the time to pack it from deep freeze into 4 cooler bags, tightly sealed to perfection.10 days and 6000 miles later, my in-laws and her tried the cake in their own kitchen. It was fantabulous, perfectly moist, and just an awesome experience!!These cakes are the best ever, baked with love, with the best service!Thank you Juwanda and Isaac, for making it a special occasion!Ha
4
Great place - offbeat location. Not too may tourists. Great place for children who love to have panckakes and waffles. Cheese toasts is actually quite cheesy. Great service and too good portions. After the heavy meal - burn those calories as you walk around Fort Canning and go on a historical trail of singapore
4
Chef very good skill at making eggs benedict. Bill slightly expensive not a huge range for vegetarians (hot food). Mostly meat dishes. Will come again, thank you
3
Had brunch and cakes at the cafe. We had the eggs ben, beef hash and mushroom soup. They were soso. Then we got two cakes - Nutty Monkey and a lemon cake - . Both are dry and after a while it's too much for us and we had to drink lots of water. The cakes are not too bad but we should have gotten another cream cake instead.
5
Nice sort of container restuarant located near fort canning park. Food was super nice especially the wide varieties of cakes.
5
Simply love the food and ambience. Will definitely go back again! Staffs are very attentive and helper.
4
Value for money. Cosy and nice ambience. Prawn pasta and fish n chips portion was gd and yummy. Just a little noisy.
3
At first look, the location seems nice- on the periphery of Fort Canning Park by the River Valley Road. Unfortunately all the views you get from the inside are those of the River Valley Road and none of the other sides. So, despite having a great location they do not seem to have been able to make good use of it. The seems good, a decent variety of appetizers, snacks, brunch and other mains. I tried the Egg Benedict with Spinach and it was pretty average. The eggs were poached nicely but the brioche was pretty boring, as was the sauce. Nothing too great about the side of Rosemary Potatoes either. The drinks section was also a regular cafe menu so nothing special their too. Same goes for the service, average. Hardly 3-4 tables were occupies and still I had to wait a long to get my bill. Maybe this was not the best day to visit, but I think it could be worth exploring more of the menu there
1
Great cake, nice locationrather average breakfastvery arrogant Manager, he wanted to push us to a table which we did not like and said all others are reserved..
5
Came here around early afternoon at 1.15pm. Glad we reserved cause it was almost full house so reservation highly recommended. Got seated & I ordered the blueberry pancakes while my girlfriend had the The Fab(Eggs Ben with salmon). Mine was so filling, with blueberries oozing out when you cut the pancakes so I would try again & The Fab had perfectly poached eggs that were to die for and it was filling too so I wouldn't mind trying it again & again. Service was great as one of the workers kept walking around to ask if everything was okay. Overall, a great experience here

Arrived at the Fabulous Baker Boy at 10.30am on Sunday to find that it opened at 11am. Quite a large queue forming which is a sign of a good restaurant. 10.45 comes and all the staff are standing in the restaurant looking at their watches and the door from inside the restaurant, and the queue is looking a the door in the heat from the outside. This weird stand off continues for 15 minutes even to the point of the waiter holding the door handle from the inside at 10.58 and counting down to 11am? Ok, their license/insurance probably doesn't kick in until 11am but it was rather weird!11am comes, and we are all seated. The restaurant slowly filling up. Then we're told that they cannot take any food orders until 11.15. 11.10 comes and the restaurant is packed to the brim. So instead of gradually taking orders and lessening the burden on the kitchen, they wait until the whole restaurant is full then take everyone's order at once. No wonder the food takes forever to arrive. Also 11.15 is an odd time to start taking orders for breakfast. By the time it arrives everyone is ready for lunch.Over hyped restaurant that is worth going to once to try the cakes but that's all
1
Great location, nice looking, good atmosphere. It was just the food was terrible. All orders were just too bad to consider going back. I'm not a picky eater, but my stomach is still turning a little bit. No one in our group finished their food. Orange juice was good and fresh and coffee was ok.
3
Me and some friends tried the dinner here and we didn't think it was that awesome. I wouldn't say that about their cakes though! The dinner set menu has only 4 options but we were okay with that. The duck confit was a little too salty and steak was average. One big pro is the location of this cafe. We love how this place is tucked away and quiet. I think they would score better if i went in the day time. Then, I would come back
4
Hidden away at the base of Fort Canning (just across the road from Clarke Quay) this is a lovely bright cafe with a diverse brunch/lunch menu, and an amazing display of cakes. We enjoyed excellent coffee, juices and Egg Benedict, followed by a shared slice of Red Velvet cake. Portions were generous, staff were friendly and the food was delicious. Only complaint would be that two of our meals arrived a good 10mins before the others in our group
5
Everyone made us feel very welcome when we went to dine, and friendly! Food was good as well, and overall made our day really good because of them!
4
My husband I came here for lunch during a recent trip to Singapore. We were staying at Hotel Fort Canning which is just up the hill so this was a convenient location. The atmosphere was funky and cool. There was even a glass room where you can see, whom I assume to be the Fabulous Baker Boy himself, making his sweet creations. The menu was great with lots of cafe style options to choose from. We only wanted a quick bite so opted for a couple of toasted sandwiches. The sandwiches were fantastic and delivered on the description in the menu. The cakes we saw looked so delicious and we regret not having the room to try them.Now the service.....It wasn't particularly busy when we went. I believe we were there after the lunch rush crowd. There were heaps of tables with dirty plates on them and we were a little slow in getting served. The waiter we had was more interested in his mobile than his guests. The Fabulous Baker Boy on the other hand made a point of asking us how our meals were and checked in. When we finished, we waited for a bit but then we got the feeling we were being ignored by the phone obsessed waiter. So husband goes up to pay. Asks how much. No reply as Waiter was checking phone. Finally an answer, husband hands over money and needs change. Phone dings, waiter responds to text before handing over change. That was ridiculous. This was probably the worst service experience we had in Singapore. The guy obviously didn't care or want to be there. I wonder if the Fabulous Baker Boy is aware of the other staff's behaviour because if he was I'm sure he wouldn't be happy.Don't let this deter you - the food is really fantastic and the restaurant itself is very fun and a nice place. Be prepared for bad service if that same guy is there....hopefully he isn't

Been wanting to check this place out since i saw the sign near the bus stop. Finally got the chance this afternoon with my best friend for an early Valentine's Day lunch!Cosy little cafe, the a/c could have been turned down abit though...Service started off lacking but recovered quickly. Well done!I ordered the Chilli Crab Mac and Cheese while my friend had Towkay Ng's Eggs Benedict. The food took awhile but was worth the wait! Mac and Cheese wasnt heavy and nicely balanced out with the chilli crab - which wasnt over-powering. My friend also enjoyed her eggs benedict. Serving portion was just right also.We didnt have space for dessert so took away a slice of the signature AB Fab Red Velvet - which we had for tea a couple of hours later. Cake was still nice and moist, though abit heavy. I have to say the cake portions are huge so it might be a good idea to share.I'm sure this place will be our new mid-week getaway! Just hope that the lunch service can be abit quicker to cater to the office lunch time crowd. Oh and reservations are recommended - we were lucky this time
3
We had heard so much about this restaurant and finally booked for Sunday. Great menu good concept but extremely disjointed. No meal or drink arrived at the same time it took over 2 hours for breakfast which is great but not to wait for food, drinks etc. we will give them another chance but be prepared. Thank yo
5
I had been wanting to visit the Fabulous Baker Boy, located at the foothills of the Fabulous Fort Canning Park. This is just across Novotel Clarke Quay / Liang Court. They have very nice cakes and I tried one. It was a valhorna chocolate cake and it was very good. Wish I wasn't alone and more people were with me. That way we could have tried a variety of cakes.
4
Food is amazing, but slightly too expensive for the small portion and little plating effort. Cake is great, very moist... In fact the portion is a bit too huge! Could not even finish a slice.Ambience is beautiful, it looks amazing from outside but it can be quite noisy when it's packed.Overall, not a bad place to have coffee and cakes but not so much of their meals (For that portion I feel we should be charged lesser than what we paid for). Also, food took really long to come.www.voneats.com/2015/12/the-fabulous-baker-boy.htm

TFBB is easily my new favorite venue for brunch. My partner and I appreciated the sincere service and wholesome food. Firstly, I was quite taken by the bistro's decor surroundings. TFBB is located at the base of the Fort Canning Hill, and it's glass walls opens out into bright flower beds and an expansive green lawn... The furniture is largely birch - pretty and practical. It just really felt like we were hanging out in someone's patio!I ordered an all day breakfast and it turned out unexpectedly good. The eggs florentine were beautifully poached and the butter-free hollandaise sauce was well balance and the perfect complement to the dish. I have had many eggs florentine in my life, and it's always pleasant when you walk into a place that actually understands eggs florentine! My partner ordered an apple cider's pancake which was to die for! We loved the soft, fragrant apple bits in the fluffy batter... I don't know how to describe it but I will proudly say that we finished every last bit! We completed our meal with coffee and a cake to share... We chose the Jacintha (part of the diva series apparently) and I loved it so much I bought some back for the family. It was a Pandan, Gula Melaka cake, coconut and cream cheese cake... This is the first time I have encountered an ingredient mix like this but it certainly worked! The cake was moist and light and not too sweet! Loved it. Service was sincere.... That is they seemed happy and willing to please and facilitate your dining experience. The staff seem quite young so I don't imagine they would be able to tell you how many type of apples make a apple cider pancake, for example. The owner, Juwanda, was fabulous though.... He was friendly and patient enough to tell me that it takes 3 types of apples to create his very tasty pancakes!

We were so disappointed with everything ! Service , noise , quality and quantity of food ! So many better choices in Singapore !

Poor staff attitude. We went during 9 plus and one of the staff told us that they are closing and somehow trying to persuade us not to come in. But in the end we still choose to have some cake there. And when we ask for flavour of the cakes in the fridge, one of the staff annoyingly ask us to look at the label on the tray which we didn't notice.. we realise that there were two Malay staff and one Chinese staff working on that night. During the time we were there,all we saw was the Chinese staff mopping,cleaning and almost all the chores are done by him while the other two Malays staff were not doing anything. When around 10 plus, one of the Caucasian family came in,but the staff did not notice them about the closing time. This is where I find that they are being such a racist and they try to tell all the Chinese customers that they are closing except for the Caucasian family. After that visit, I tell myself, no matter how delicious your food is, the service that you're providing in the restaurant and how their staff is portraying out this racism ways of serving really just make me not coming back again. (P.s. I did even email and call the main office and they told me that they will check and get back on me but two months pass and I've never get any reply or answer from them) hope they hire the right staff.

Was an old swimming complex, now transformed into a rather nice and serene corner opposite the bustling and music-deafening Clarke Quay. This is where this quiet cafe-restaurant is being located.Had wanted to get away from the music for a while and spotted it from across the road. We were there too late and the kitchen was closed. It was about past 10pm. But the good thing was, they still have cakes and soft drinks.I won't say their things were cheap. You could probably get 2 burgers from the fast food for a slice there. But they were real nice. So nice you really feel like buying one each to try, only to be stopped by the price tags.We took a walk around after the late night dessert. I won't call the place a park. More like a garden, with (probably) the park's office next to the cafe.I believe it will be a nice place to be to read a book, or meet a few friends in the day. Strongly recommended. Just watch the spending tho... :

Cosy cafe with good food. Don't leave without ordering the cakes. Could be crowded at times so try to make reservations.

This is a nice brunch place. The dishes are tasty and one has to try the cake, which is fantastic. Service could be better and more attentive.
5
I stopped by for a late breakfast and had eggs benedict plus a nice organic flat white coffee. Both food and drink were excellent. I enjoyed the relaxed and family friendly atmosphere on a late Sunday morning.I would have loved to try the cakes but did not have time - I'll definitely come back
5
Was taken here for dessert after dinner by my relatives and absolutely loved the place.Surrounded by beautiful greenery and away from the busy streets, it's an awesome place to chill out.The cakes..are awesome!! I particularly loved the Sugee Cake.The crew there are very nice too and that makes it even more comfortable to just chill, relax and chat

 Went there with my gf. Initially its a little hard to find as it is hidden on the outskirt of Fort Canning Park so please do check your location wisely first. Next, upon reaching the cafe, we were greeted with warm smiles and great service attitude. The place is meticulously decorated, giving people a cosy and warm feeling. The crew member came and lighted up our candlelight as well as served us a bottle of chilled water. Then we took our order. We order the roasted chicken with waffles with an addition of a soft drink and cake, as well as a cottage pie. The prices were actually really quite expensive! We regretted initially. But when the food was served, it was much to our delight. The taste of the chicken blended in with the waffles maple syrup really well. I felt it was a very unique and interesting combination. The chicken skin is thin and the waffle is rly crisp so fret not if u dislike soft waffles! Then after finishing the chicken and waffles, we waited for our cottage pie for ard 20mins but nothing arrived. So we asked the service crew and they realised they missed out the order. However they were really apologetic and served us a complimentary glass of Coke as well as a soup of the day which was some Lobster Soup. The crew member was rly friendly and even told us that the soup color will look awful(looks a bit like faeces color) but it tastes quite nice. In fact we all agreed it tasted somewhat like the 'atas' version of the 'prawn noodle soup'. The soup was rly filling. Meanwhile they rushed to make our cottage pie and it arrived. The cottage pie was very much to the liking of my gf so i think it was worth the wait! Overall, i think the service crew were fantastic and deserve some sort of compliment. They were all smiles and rly friendly. They will not hesitate to serve u and u can feel free to ask them anything!

A lovely gathering with friends where we tried their Mariah Carey (Brown sugar and rum sponge $10) and pandan flavour cake. If you are in luck, you could see the baker "boy" baking in action too. I really like how this is located within the park. I would come back again

Had reserved a table for a dinner date there but ended up not needing one as there were many tables available during dinner. It had a nice cosy ambiance to it, particularly the addition of cushions on the seats and what not, but the use of the folding ikea chairs were a bit of a turn off to me due to it being quite uncomfortable, but no bother i came here to try the food ! Started out with the mushroom salad that i shared with my date, wasn't too bad i reckon. After that i had the chicken on waffles and the mrs had the fish and chips. The chicken and waffles had a very unique taste to it, both sweet and savoury at the same time but somehow i felt it wasn't that great of a dish afterall. The mrs had no complains with her fish and chips but again there was nothing special about it. Finished the dinner with a cup of coffee, low and behold i was shocked at how this place serves amazing coffee ! I had the cappuccino and i was very impressed ! This place would be ideal just for coffee and cakes i reckon. I'll definitely be back for the coffee but not for the mains. Top tip - Park at liang court ($3 per entry) and cross the bridge to get opposite to the foothills where you'll find this quaint restaurant

Besides the fabulous name, this place has a great location at the foothill of the Fort Canning park. There is no outdoor seating but its nice little garden and swings area especially if you have little ones in tow. Their Towskay Ng’s Eggs Ben, with spinach, is pleasantly not overloaded with greens and quite nicely done. The highlight is the grilled cheese- three chesses on sourdough, in the oven and on the griddle, yummy. There’s an assortment of cakes, with big, tasty chunks to be had.

read reviews about their much raved carrot cake and I had a huge craving for carrot cake so decided to give it a try. wrong move. their cake was moist, but the taste wasn't quite right. I had 2 pathetic raisins in it and the cream cheese frosting was way too overpowering. I had to scrape the frosting away. I gave up eating half way through it. judging from the price I paid, it's definitely not worth it.

This cafe was recommended about 10 months ago, and as I am a Singaporean, there is no excuse that I can have for not going there.I walked in and was warmly welcomed by Juwanda, the owner of "the Fabulous Baker Boy".I ordered a coffee and chocolate cake. I must say the coffee is nothing like what I have tasted in cafes in Singapore. I was told it is a house blend of selected beans, and the result is extremely satisfactory!!! As for the exotic display of cakes, Juwanda himself does all the baking. The slice of chocolate cake I had was moist, texture was of the "just right" softness, and delicately sweet - not sickly sweet like most confectionary, probably so to hide the inferior product!My verdict is, if in Singapore, and you want a nice coffee and cake, look no further than "the FABULOUS BAKER BOY".It is located at River Valley Road, in a old swimming pool grounds not far from the glitzy Orchard Road shopping belt of Singapore
5
Been here twice and just enjoyed having their cakes. Their coffee is also not too bad. Worth visiting but if you drive, got to find parking around the area.
5
Perfect place for Sunday brunch. Lovely and relaxing ambiance. Great tasting food and really good service. Try their cakes!
5
Initially came here for cakes a week before this visit and tried more cakes as well as their breakfast menu. I think we made better cake choices on the first visit but there were still faves among those we picked this time. I love the Bette Midler which is an Earl Grey infused cake with a hint of lemon. Pancakes were fluffy and had a nice chew to it drenched in syrup, delicious! The poached eggs paled in comparison as the eggs are overcooked. What I love about this place is the range of flavours and not the only the usual predictable flavours but fun experimental ones. Service is warm and friendly
5
We went with family as we had heard this place had the best carrot cake in Singapore. So we felt on a lazy Sunday afternoon we had better try some. We in fact tried 3 cakes, the carrot cake, the Valhrona chocolate cake and the coffee and chocolate cake. All 3 were light, tasty, rich and delicate. All were stars. Our cousins who live nearby agreed the carrot cake was the best they'd had. Plus we got to talk to the chef :)An absolute delight
5
On my last day in Singapore, my friends took me to The Fabulous Baker Boy telling me they had the best pancakes in the world. Of course I had to give them a try. The raspberry pancakes definitely lived up to this report. The raspberries inside were fresh and clearly not from a frozen batch. Also, the beef sausage has an amazing honey glaze flavor to them. I loved my experience here and look forward to coming back for brunch next time I'm in Singapore.

Heard quite good reviews from the media and decided to surprise my boyfriend by going there today for our Sunday brunch. We ordered Ju's prawn pasta and curry chicken. The pasta looks like it just came out from the microwave. The curry chicken is served with 2 pratas where the pastry texture is more of a croissant. Curry sauce tasted a bit sweet and certainly do not have the traditional spicy taste of curry we eat in Singapore. Place was too crowded and too noisy for anyone who wish to spend a cosy Sunday brunch. It's a pity that we visited this cafe first time and walking off disappointed
4
been here a few times. every time the service was up to scratch, even when they were full. had the champions breakfast - the lamb sausage was the standout of that dish. the rosemary potatoes were great but the eggs ben could have been runnier. ice mocha was full of taste - it felt like i still had the powder in my mouth. this is a compliment by the way. brings back memories of puttin spoonfuls of milo in my mouth straight from the can. the grilled beef sandwich was alright, i thought it could benefit from having more cheese. the tuna melt was superb. speaking of superb, so was the prawn pasta. the fried chicken and waffles was just friend chicken and waffles on the same plate. i'm sorry but there was just nothing special about it. the curry that is available only on sundays was a great try. not too spicy. a bit mild and not overpowering unlike those other curries that sell 60 cents (now 1 dollar?) prata.there is a large selection of cakes. previously the cakes were just descriptions of the taste of the cake. now they use names of famous singer.s mariah carey? they should use bjork (weird eccentric) and classic Alanis Morrissette (angry cake) and Nicki Minaj (lots of vibrant clashing colours that tastes fake). but the classics are still there : red velvet, salted caramel
3
Went for dinner with friends on a Friday night.The ambiance was nice and it's an advantage that it is located inside the park.Location-wise, it was quite hidden. Aside from the signage at the park's entrance, you have to figure and find it yourself.The food(main course) was so-so I can't find anything special considering the price which is on the high-side.But the cakes were to die for. I tried the Red Velvet with creamcheese and it was heavenly :)Overall, I suggest to go somewhere else for dinner then come here for desserts
5
I was very hesitant to review......but only due to selfish reasons that I don't want the place to get tooooo busy!!I've had many meals at the Fabulous Baker Boy and I've literally enjoyed everything! The quality of the food is superb and the friendly team are always very efficient and welcoming that I keep wanting to come back! With the proximity to Clarke Quay, the location across the busy road can be a bit tricky but it's definitely worth the little effort. It's very rare that I'm truly impressed with the food, service and ambiance of a restaurant. Happily, the FBB is one of those few places in Singapore that truly does impress :-
5
We had lunch here (chilli crab mac and cheese & cajun chicken sandwich) on a quite busy Sunday. Luckily we got here just before the queue starts (2pm). The food was nice and cakes were amazing. Pretty much influenced by the British baking but they blend into the cakes some Asian flavour as well e.g. Carrot cake topped with dried coconut. We'd definitely come back again to try out other cakes
4
But it's a little bit inconvenient because we need to walk over a distance from the carpark...............................................
4
Tasty food, decent service. I had the Towkay Ng Eggs Benedict which was great. My gf had the Tuna melt, which was tasty but quite big. We also had to try the carrot cake given the previous reviews we'd read... overall would recommend this place for a chilled out weekend brunch
5
We came here for lunch and in one week came back 3 times. The coffee is delicious. We tried 3 cakes and the standout one was the applecider...yum. You'll see the chef in his room in the left by the front door.....bet you'll find him either making cakes or on his iPad! Walk through Fort Canning park for an excellent workup first. It is a beautiful park and the only way through is up and over........
5
Arrived without reservations and lucked into a table on Sunday brunch. I'd advise making reservations. Great location and greater food experience. My cheesehead wife says, "the best grilled cheese ever!" I'd say same for garlic fries and the Guinness pie. Everything people ate looked delicious including eggs Benedict and pancakes. You can't go wrong and even though we were stuffed, I'm glad we purchased 2 slices of cake to take home - simply awesome!
4
Came here with my partner and family. Arrived just after kitchen closed at 3 so missed out on sampling the food menu (the pie sounded great) so we tucked into the cakes. They have a great selection and well presented and good tasting. The cafe itself is in a nice location at the foot of Fort Canning Park in a converted old swimming pool complex. Although close to River Valley Rd, you don't hear or really see the traffic as blocked by trees. Recommend this place....we'll be coming back again soon
4
Our family enjoyed our lunch here. Its a perfect location amongst Fort Canning Park. Nice to be amongst the trees, and there's a nice view through the glass walls.We enjoyed our prawn pasta here, and also the apple pancakes. An ice coffee hit the spot too
4
We had 3 slices of cakes and 4 mains shared among the 2 of us, so rest assure that the hefty price tag is quite warranted. TFBB is well known for their cakes, which are your classic sponge cakes with light creamy frosting. While they have nailed the sponge cakes, to me it does not warrant $8+ spent on a slice. Their savouries are pretty well done though. We had the Guinness Beef Pot Pie, Beef Hash, Eggs Ben and Wild Mushroom Salad.For photos and the full review, head over here: http://www.chocolat-et-basil.com/#!The-Fabulous-Baker-Boy/cmbz/51B7D528-BE7A-480B-97E9-BC0D38DCF5B

I make a point of ordering either vanilla cupcakes, or carrot cake when its on the menu so I can have feel for a stores quality and compare. I would put their carrot cake in my top 3 of all time (call me eccentric, but when living in the UK I would travel up to 50 miles to try out quality home made products, so a top 3 for me is something special).Highly recommended

We came here for a coffee break in the late afternoon. The cafe decoration is nice and cozy. The lightings are very good, if you're up for a photography. The location is pretty good too, as it's located just beneath fort canning hill.We ordered lemon flavoured vanilla cake. There's not much vanilla taste and it's very sweet. Given the fact that they're famous for cakes, I think this is really a disappointment. We do notice that they're fully booked for dinner. Perhaps the dinner will be good, but definitely not the cakes
4
Great ambience, good food and amazing cakes..are the top three highlights of this place! Away from the hustle bustle of the cafes and restaurants that line the CQ and Robertson quay banks- this place is situated in a quiet and cool green corner giving it just the right feel of a relaxed Saturday noon brunch place. Everything on the menu is good! The coffee was good, the garlic fries were perfect, the chocolate pancakes were a delight and the sandwiches were delectable. A serving of the velvet cake was yumm!Some things to take note of-1. Call and book a table in advance! This place is always packed and for good reason..2. The servings are pretty generous. So, begin with few items first and then order more if needed. The food is too good to be wasted out of over ordering. Hope you all enjoy the place as much as my friends and I did!
5
Everything about the experience was awesome! The food was yummy, the cakes divine! Even the fabulous baker boy himself was great warm presence. Please expand and open up shop in Manila! I'll help! ;)
4
Wide selection of cakes for you to choose from! Nice ambiance as they make use of natural light in the day and it's locate at fortcanning park so you can take a walk after a sinful meal! :)
5
Amazing crew and delicious cakes!!! The location is easy to find: right next to clarke quay... I really loved and I'll miss this place! Thank you ??????????
3
Excellent food, everything tasted great. But their AC is cranked so high you really freeze, which is really unpleasant. Patrons were moving around uncomfortably trying to find a spot which wasn't in the way of the freezing AC. So make sure you dress warmly!
4
Visited the restaurant on a Saturday night. Concluded with their wonderful service and the good cakes. A quiet place near the foot hill of fort canning. Will be interest to visit them again for brunch.

During my stay here in Singapore I have been to many places that serve nice looking deserts with hefty price tags. Often these desserts lack flavor and leave me wanting. This is not one of those places, here taste is king.I've visited TFBB many times and for many reasons: brunch, dinner, tea time... just because my sweet tooth needed attention... each time I've been thouroughly delighted with my experience. Having tried more things than I care to admit, I have settled on some favorites. First, and probably the best cake I've ever eaten, is the Nutty Monkey. Nicely spiced banana cake, delicous peanutbutter, and chocolate! Second, the carrot cake -- this is one place I agree with some of the Singapore food bloggers, the carrot cake at TFBB is amazing. Today I'm enjoying an orange chocolate ricotta tart and a slice of the "good mess" cake for the first time. The tart has a lovely texture and the orange choclate really shines. The cake is moist, rich without being too heavy, and has bits of chocolate that seem to burst in your mouth as you eat it.I've posted this review to hungrygowhere but also wanted to put it here on TripAdvisor for those visiting Singapore as I believe this place is not to be missed
5
The cakes of the Fabulous Baker Boy are THE best. You can just tell that it's made from quality ingredients - no scrimping happened here. I had the lemon coconut cake, the raspberry lemon cake (totally different from each other, by the way), and THE BEST RED VELVET CAKE EVER.We also tried the savoury dishes and oh my gosh I will never forget the chill crab mac and cheese. I want some again! Also, the curry and prata are the best I've ever had! :)The host and all the waiters and waitresses were also very nice and efficient.I will definitely go back... and I encourage everyone to visit this quaint little place near Clarke Quay

I went to this cafe today to have brunch. I had read reviews about the food and being a foodie wanted to try the menu. But that's pretty much as far as I got. I am truly disgusted with the attitude myself and my partner encountered when ordering our food from firstly the waitress and then from the owner himself who didn't even have the decency to come into the cafe and discuss my request.You may be wondering what that request was.... I wanted my poached egg hard poached! Yes according to the waitress , you can't have hard poached eggs at FBB. Why you may again ask....because they will only cook them in batches and not to the customers request. So I asked her to go and ask the chef if they could, the chef today according to the waitress being the owner Juwanda Hassim. However he refused to , despite at the bottom of the order sheet that you have to fill in there being a section for special request's. So my partner who had ordered a different dish , the corned beef hash, suggested the eggs that it came with were poached instead rather than fried , to cover the batch. This two was met with a flat 'no' despite it being a very amicable solution. At this point I asked to see the chef but was just given a card instead.I can only glean from this that Mr Hassim can either not cook a hard poached egg, is too arrogant and thinks he knows best for his customers , or just doesn't care enough about his customers to treat them as individuals. Suffice to say I will not be going back and will dissuade friends and colleagues from trying there fare

I have eaten here several times and have come away quite pleased each time. The new enclosed layout works better than I thought, I was a fan of the more open to nature feel of the place. Food keeps getting better. Besides the cakes, which are worth visiting for, the small menu has some gems. Chillie crab mac and cheese is way better than it sounds. The press are some of the best in Singapore and the coffee is great. I will be back.
5
The signature Eggs Benedict is fantastic. A must-try for egg lovers. Unfortunately they could only make two servings at a time, and it's not advisable to pre-order as it should be eaten as soon as it is served. Be warned if you come in a large group
