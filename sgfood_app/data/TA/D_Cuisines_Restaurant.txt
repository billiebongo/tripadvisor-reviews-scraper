I booked this restaurant because of an Indonesia Muslim family who arrived around 20:00hr. Being near to Changi Airport, they can have their dinner without much delay and it is also halal.The menu is wide and authentic. The setting is simple and quiet mostly in the evening. We order their main dishes such as briyani, grill meat platter, mixture of 4 types of naan, fried seafood rice, spinach in a cheese purÃ©e, chicken tikkar, even a Chinese styled Black Pepper crab and many others.The briyani is good because the rice is moist and very well favored with the lamb meat. The lamb is tender and because it is cook in the rice, it retains the moisture too. All 7 adults and 1 child had a sumptuous dinner but we were unable to finish the food and we had to do a take-away to avoid wastage. Inclusive of 2 jugs of lime juice, the big was about SGD 300. It is on the high side but given the big servings and authentic and delicious cooking, we felt it is worth the price. The 2 draw backs are that the service is almost none. The waiters and waitress are not present and inattentive. The setting of the restaurant is dated and a renovation is appropriate given that the food is good to return

We've been coming with my family and extended family (all 14 of us) since it opened. The Indian cuisine is always consistent, we love the Briyani rice, Butter Chicken, Nan, Spinach Cottage Cheese, etc. The Chinese selection is also good e.g. Crispy Chicken, Cereal Prawn and Calamari, Fried Rice, etc. Great for big gatherings as they have a big 13 seater table in a private room setting. Serving staffs are efficient and friendly too

The place is relatively quiet... Chinese food here is good..standards are comparable to other well known chinese restaurants. The price is also reasonable. The Plus point... North Indian cuisine is served as well and not disappointing if you happen to like Indian food. D'fusion could be its other name. Worth a second visit. Make your reservations..car park space is ample..try it for a relaxing meal

Despite staying near this restaurant, i have never known it's existence till someone came up to my area to sell some coupons. I bought 2 and went to D' Cuisines to try it out. Service was average but I must say i like the food there. Twice i went, their signature fish head curry did not disappoint me. The rest of the dishes like stir fry beef, cereal prawns, salted fish fried rice were good as well. Definitely worth a revisit
