An ideal spot for a quick lunch. We had a selection of dumplings with the standout being the spinach and prawn dumplings.

1. Friendly and pleasant staff
2. Resonable and competitive price around Chinatown area.
3. plently of Carpark lots at Chinatown point.
4. Can be noisy when crowded, especially peak hours.
5. Have good tea leaf at premium price.
3
The food here is below average. However in consideration of the pricing, I upgrade it to average.
Can skip if you want. You have not missed anything.
4
The usual dim sum selections of har quo ($4.90), shrimp chee chong fun ($4.90), carrot cake, Xiao long bao ($4,90), chicken porridge ($7.00) is reasonable and tasty.
4
Went for weekday lunch and ordered the lunch set menu for 10 pax. The food was not bad, but service could be better. The restaurant was crowded as usual during weekdays lunch period, which resulted in food served slowly and tea pot not promptly refilled.
4
The food is good & reliable, Cantonese style cuisine. We had xiao long pao, siew mei, steam chicken, pork ribs, char siew, chee cheong fun & ee fu noodles. Everything was quite tasty. We went at a lean time & so service was prompt. The only negative is that it is priced on a higher side, compared to other similar restaurants & considering the location. But good place to have business meetings

The restaurant seems' imitating' the name of Luk Yu restaurant in Hong Kong. Apparently, the owner of this restaurant is not aware of the fact that Hong Kong Luk Yu has been notorious for its waiters' extremely bad services to new customers. Anyhow, the food of this Singapore Luk Yu is so-so. The services are so-so too. It is quite crowded during luncheon time. The prices of food are reasonable

Had dim sum on lazy sunday with family. The dim sum is quite unique with some dishes different from the usual suspects. Overall the dishes are alright. Love the almond paste with egg white dessert but a bit expensive for a small bowl comparatively.The ambience in the restaurant is not that pleasant with the loading of used c rockeries and utensils done right in the midst of the restaurant at the full view of the diners. Very unsightly. The service staff is doing their basic job without any value add to diners.Ordered 4 dim sum dishes and 2 desserts cost $45

I visited the place a few months ago . Was superb . Went there today : average food and deplorable service ! As usual in Singapore , a few retired don't care don't smile aunties , a I don't care manager spoils the all lunch while the kitchen staff crosses the restaurant with the trash bin . What a waste 
4
Food was excellent, we had a the BBQ pork bun which was yummy, the duck portion was fantastic and the char siew pork was excellent! Just be warned you do get charged for tap water. They also put down, the random beans and a wet towel (napkin) on the table, you also get charged for this if you use them. Would recommend.

Basically the menu is a regular dim sum place. But the food is really not comparable to a good dim sum restaurant. Probably meant for tourist as the location is often visited by tourist.
5
We ordered the bbq pork and soya chicken which were both great, but the standout dish for me was the steamed cod with ginger. Absolutely delish. Air con and good beer and wine too!
4
We came in at lunch time and they only served Dim Sum at that time, but it was so good!! The Spicy Shrimp Dumpling are to die for!! The pork filled buns are more meat that bun! You should go it's a nice place to get your eat on!
4
After 3 weeks in Singapore this is as good as any dim sum restaurant and great prices too. 3 of us, no alcohol, sufficient food of good quality and friendly attentive service 55 dollars. No doubt we shall come back here. Location a bit away from Chinatown but very near Park Royal hotel

Always walked past Luk Yu at Chinatown Point but only tried out the food recently. It is another example of Singapore's growing band of quality dim-sum restaurants. It was Saturday evening over the F1 Weekend and surprisingly not packed, we seated w/o having to wait!We add a few dimsum dishes of prawn dumpling, xiao long bao & spring roll to our dinner dishes. Did not disappoint, fresh and tasty. They certainly knows how to make good Dim Sum that got diners returning for more!. Most cost $4.80 per dish of 3.nWe ordered the Peking duck at $38 (promotional pricing) which was a steal. Standard is no far below what I tasted in Peking’s 全聚德 . the duck meat was subsequently added into the noodle as a separate dish. Sweet sour pork and poach spinach are ok but the grouper fillet was not outstanding. The seafood rice noodles was a disappointment at $25. Overall the dishes tasted bland (understand that chef does cooking with minimum msg.healthy but may not be appealing)The best part surprisingly was the dessert. We really love the Mango Pomelo Dessert that we had ordered. The hot almond is also another good choice. Remarkable, smooth and yet tasteful.We were lucky to be served by a good female restaurant manager whom is knowledgeable. Overall no pull nor "wow" factor and is a little on the pricier side. But still a good place for dinner.

@TheKuoKnowsDon't confuse this Luk Yu with the its venerable namesake in Hong Kong's Stanley Street. But that doesn't mean it is in any way inferior. Far from it.Singapore's Luk Yu at Chinatown Point certainly knows how to make good Dim Sum. The Har Gaus are some of the best I have sampled. Ample prawns enveloped in delicate pastry.The Char Siu Soh has just the right amount of flaky puff to encase a generous portion of succulent BBQ pork.The Fried Carrot Cake is heavenly, as was the Steamed Pork Ribs. The Pan Fried Chive Dumplings are well worth a try at $4.50 for a plate of three.Luk Yu is another example of Singapore's growing band of quality dim-sum restautants. It's a little on the pricier side. But that is acceptable as long as the food is good. And it is

This place offer dim sum dishes even during weekdays dinner time. The food were decent and my family and I really love the Mango Pomelo Dessert that we had ordered. The other main dishes and appetizer were nice too but not till the extend of giving a "wow" factor. We ordered the bamboo clam for each of us, it is nice but we had better ones elsewhere. Overall is still a good place for dinner
5
The location of the restaurant is not ideal but the service provided by the staff is excellent. They are attentive and fast. The food is good - not too salty nor oily and yet is delicious. Price is also reasonable. I am sure most people know about this restaurant through word of mouth and recommendation
4
The dim sums are decent and the prices are reasonable (not the cheapest though). There are also other Cantonese dishes to choose from if you are not into dim sum. Menu are in both Chinese and English so ordering is easy. Staff are friendly and attentive
3
We made reservations but found the place less than half full at 8 pm. One of us had come for dimsum. After looking through the menus, we opted for dinner set for 3-4 pax. and we added their house specialty, Chicken with Nam Yee -?Only the soup was really good. The grouper fillet was smooth so we know the chef has skills. The wasabi prawns lacked fire and depth.The fried rice - virtually tasteless.Well, if I knew for a fact that they do not use MSG in their cooking, I would have found this more acceptable
3
Came here as it was opened early morning. Dim sum is average, nothing memorable. there are many other better choices nearby. And the service could be better
4
We had a fabulous dim sum banquet for 7 people. Ordering was easy, the staff were attentive and service was quick, but most importantly, everything we ordered was tasty and and truly authentic. Can highly recommend this restaurant for dim sum

Had my first try with their pork knuckles with vinegar. That heavenly taste makes me wanting to go back for more.. That tender pork and the sourness of the vinegar blended so well together. Hence it is a must try food! Having something sour to open up your taste bud everything else tend to taste goid as well. Consider adding char siew pao to the menu, along with that chee cheong fun to feel the smoothness of the skin n we chose char siew filling which is so yummmyyy!!Other honourable mention is their har gao siew mai, egg tart (farm eggs).Last but not least a dessert! Goji berry guai fa gou!!!! Yummmyyy with a cup of tea and refreshed after having that wonderful lunc

My family brought me there after giving me a raving review about this restaurant.I was there only to realize that most of the Dim Sum dishes that I had set my mind to try were not available. But the service is good, the waitress quickly recommended some replacement dishes

Visited this restaurant for lunch on a Saturday. As most of the food items were not available, we had the impression that it must be a popular restaurant. We had a few different types of dim sum. As we are locals and have eaten at different eateries in Chinatown, we find the food quite ordinary.
4
We were awed by the choices of restaurants in Chinatown... but we finally stumbled across this one and there were locals eating inside and we thought we could manoeuvre through the menu with ease. Fortunately there was a single staff member that could speak English so he was able to assist us... because 'ease' did not come to mind. After making some simple selections, we did have a rather nice meal. Keeping our selections basic was probably the wisest choice when we were not that confident. I would say it was better than average, but if I was in the area again... I would explore another restaurant rather than making this a regular haunt. All in all... it was a good experience for some hungry travellers

This is our third visit. The restaurant is pretty popular and crowded at lunch time. We had to sit outside to wait for a table. As we were rushing for time, we just ordered a bowl of fish porridge, a bowl of wanton noodles and one serving of xiao-long bao. The porridge is okay but the noodles were a tad overcooked. The xiao-long bao was really disappointing as the skin was too starchy and sticky. We had a better experience the last time we had dinner here. Wonder if they have changed their chef
4
Very nice little restaurant and friendly service. We went there for yum cha dim sum lunch. Good selection, and the dishes were delicious. Beer is available. Very busy place, but there's a row of seats outside the restaurant, where people can wait until a table is available. We'll be back.Cheers Niels & Mary, Humpty Doo, NT, Australia, Down Unde

Had a meal there in July & thoroughly enjoyed the food, service, temperature & ambiance.Returned to in Singapore in September and the restaurant for another meal.We had Bamboo Clams, Scallops this Asparagus, Sliced Pork, Sliced Pork Knuckle, Duck & Crispy Pork with Mango Sweets. The beer was cold & the tea plentiful.The service was exceptional, the food totally enjoyable, very relaxing & comfortable atmosphere

My family and I stopped by after deciding against spending $98/pp for a Sunday Champagne Brunch. With 5 of us that would've been a hefty check... instead, we stepped into the first restaurant at the mall, and were duly satisfied for under $200 when the check was settled.Pros:1. Tasty dishes: Turnip cake, BBQ Buns, Banana Baos, Chives with Scallops, Peking Duck (they'll slice and prep the skin for add'l charge, and then you get to pick how you want to eat the rest of the duck. We had it stir-fried and while the meat was exceptionally tender, I *think* it loses the original roast flavor a bit too much.) 2. Good service/good selection.Cons:1. "Sealed With a Kiss" played on a loop. As such as we love oldies and the song... 2. A la carte $20 Wasabi Shrimp (deep fried prawns doused in mayo with a hint of wasabi flavor). Avoid! 3. Little extra charges that are typical of Singapore... $10 to slice the Peking duck, lil add-ons for for appetizer, wet towel, tea, water.Overall, solid

We visited this restaurant to celebrate the birthday of my brother-in-law. The dim-sums were quite tasty but the soup-dumplings were a little disappointing. The other food we ordered from the ala carte menu were also delicious. Worth the visit.

Good authentic Chinese food at a price in a Chinatown shopping mall. Service a little slow, but the quality is certainly there.
5
Wonderful selection of dim sum--all very tasty. Friendly and good service. Pleasant atmosphere in a food court. Prices reasonable.
3
Enjoy with family on our first visit. Tim Sum with good varieties and taste. There is a Suckling Pig promotion but the offer price did not fit in as value of money. It can be better as compare to similar establishment .

my grandma's birthday lunch was held at Luk Yu restaurant. The quality of food was superb. High quality ingredients with very detailed food decoration. Service was attentive. All these for a reasonable price
4
This restaurant was recommended by a friend recently. I'm impressed by the variety and quality of the food there. Special mention to the egg white with crab meat dish;)
4
The 'tong fen' with prawn is very nice. Soup is good and nourishing. Had lunches with friends and the service is good. Good place for social get together

Located in the heart of Singapore's Chinatown - in the newly refurbished Chinapoint Point - Luk Yu is great with its dim sum. Although not affiliated with the more famous Hong Kong counterpart, the selection and portions are great. The dishes are all served piping hot. The "char siew bao" were soft and fluffy, and so were the "steamed ribs with black beans", and "pheonix claws". They also have excellent congee.It can get quite busy during the lunch hour but apparently they also have a discount for the after 3pm crowd .. but they may have run out of all the selections.Service was good, with very attentive waiters/waitresses

If you are looking for a place for Chinese dinner in Chinatown, Luk Yu at Chinatown Point is a good choice. The ambience is good and the food is generally sumptuous and rather inexpensive.Here are some of my recommended dishes that I order on a regular basis:1. Fried Prawns in Egg Yolk - one word - yummy! Prawns are quite big and juicy and the taste of the egg yolk is well  immersed into the seafood. - for wasabi fans, the fried prawns in wasabi sauce come highly recommended too2. Egg White with Crab Meat - with some black vinegar and pepper, this dish is heavenly. To eat on its own or to go with rice.  Include in your must order.3. Ba Xi Pork Ribs - stewed using lean pork rib with ample meat, the flesh is tender and juicy. Pork fans must try  this delicacy. Gravy goes well with the rice too.4. Asparagus with scallops - scallops are small in size but fresh and goes well with asparagus. They are fried and  contained in a nest made from vermicelli.5. Roast Chicken - comes in whole or half, the roast chicken is easy on the mouth, chewy and very tender. One of  the better roast chickens in town.Price wise, I would rate this place 3/5.For lunch and breakfast, Luk Yu serves a good spread of nice fresh dim sum.Summary- if you are looking for a good Cantonese dinner in Chinatown without burning a hole in your  pocket, pop by Luk Yu to savour their dishes. The service is commendable too

There has been lots of hips about this restaurant, which is mistaken as a branch of the INFAMOUS LUK YU TEAHOUSE in Hong Kong. In fact, this Luk Yu has no connection at all with the HONG KONG LUK YU, according to it's management!!! The food and price are acceptable; nothing fantastic. Service is also acceptable, as of this level of teahouse. There is a promotion of 30% discount for all Dim Sum from 3-5pm. However, most of the dishes are out of stock by 3pm. An average teahouse for dim sum
