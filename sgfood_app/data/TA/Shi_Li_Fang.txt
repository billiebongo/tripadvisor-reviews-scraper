Fresh ingredients at reasonable price. Thanks Shi li fang Bedok! Had a wonderful time this evening thanks to the Manager and staff. Definitely will come again.

I always order the kurobuta pork set. The pork and chicken are of high quality. Very fresh, tender and flavourful. The serving is big and i always leave the restaurant very satisfied.

The sauces were great, tomato soup was tasty and delicious (though not as flavourful as HDL or Beauty in a Pot), but mala was absolutely flavourless and lacked spiciness - just avoid ordering the latter. I loved the variety of sauces offered too! The crayfish and clams were very fresh. HOWEVER, pork was disgusting. We ordered the pork belly and the entire plate of belly strips came with pork hair still on it???!! Is this normal? Maybe it is but I find it unacceptable on my food even for that price. The pork liver was even weirder and off. Weird taste AND texture and I was very turned off after tasting these 2. Service is at an all time low. The concierge was okay. It was perpetually impossible to get the attention of any staff to help us top up our soups!! I had to get up and go ask a server and she just brushed me off unhappily. They were just constantly very busy and looking unhappy so it wasn’t exactly a happy thing dining there.

Went to the outlet at Jcube on a weekday. The place was quite busy despite it being around 3pm. The $9.90++ set was very filling, and the fish soup base was very good. Tried the mala soup base but it doesn't taste good, too oily and numbing instead of being spicy and flavourful. There were 6 other soup bases to choose from so it wasnt bad, but would be better if there were other spicy soup bases as mala soup base was the only spicy soup base. Overall the experience was alright and around $12 including service charge and gst for a person. Will go again

went to the one at city square mall; the restaurant is a bit of a squeeze, but otherwise despite the crowd, the staff are helpful, serving quite fast and clearing plates quite fast; the food is tasty; we chose 2 types of hotpot soup to cook, one spicy, one normal; we also ordered the homemade noodle, and the staff demonstrated skilfully in front of us the making of the noodles; after that, based on our bill, we also exchanged for free a huge bear soft toy

A few more Shi Li Fangs have sprouted since their first OC branch.While cheap, the quality of food is lacking. The soup bases leave you really thirsty after and you leave the restaurant smelling of steamboat soup.The smell of the soup leaves a stench as you walk pass any of their shops. Won’t recommend

Went to the Bedok Point Branch and ordered the $9.90 set which is a very good deal. You get a choice of chicken or pork which proved to be quite a lot, the pork being lean or the bacon type and a choice of broth, spicy or clear. Found the mala(spicy) too peppery and oily but surprisingly boiled faster and more vigorously than the other soup base, no matter how you rotated the pot! The serving of vegetable (Wong nga Bak) was quite overwhelming but the other ingredients, tofu, tang hoon, fishballs just right for an average appetite. We opted for the rice but you can have kway teow or noodles, I think. The dipping sauces were all good, plenty of choice from chilli to Goma sauce and a great number of condiments, parsley etc.Service was good, prompt and helpful but the decor can be very unsettling as furniture and crockery almost all plastic and the glaring brilliant green and red hues too bright unless you’re a kid and then you will love the many soft toys all over the place

My favourite go-to place for steamboat, go there at least once or twice a month. Go for the set meals for more value, and guarantee you won't overeat unlike buffets where you pay more and have to eat more. You have to ask for the set meal menu as the staff will usually only provide ala carte menu. Some people may disagree, but I think this is comparable to Haidilao and it's way cheaper

Set lunch menu comes in tiny portion, ala carte orders are totally not worth the prices at all, not forgetting all prices are subject to 7% GST & 10% SERVICE CHARGE, staff set up the steamboat & bring drinks to the table, that's the only service rendered. Definitely won't return

We were seated at the table at the newly renovated restaurant. We ordered the small pot from the menu & was shocked when the bill was charged with the large pot instead. The staff did not bother to inform us when we submitted the marked order to them to key in. Some of the side dishes items that require longer cooking time only arrived towards the end of our meal having spent 1 hr there & after asking several times.

Ordered the set meal for two that comes with a drink. Portion is just nice and they do have a nice selection of songs playing in the restaurant. A mixture of Chinese and English songs.
Plenty of soft toys on display there too.

Ordered the value set at $9.90 and it is really good. The soup is nice and the service is good there. If you are a big eater you can order more meat to go along with the set meal. One of the most value for money steamboat you can find

Located on the 7th floor of Orchard Central, you will be striked by the number of plushies / dolls all over the entrance and on the walls of the restaurant.5 of us shared a table which was quite a squeeze & food were placed in a small shaky unstable trolley The lowest tier of said trolley would be very near our feet. The not-so-friendly waitress got our orders wrong / missed out items on several occasions and charged us for those missing items. But they removed it from the bill when we told them about it.The space is really small & it was not a comfortable experience though the food was ok-ish. They also give away plushies depending on the amount you spend

The food is not bad. They have few branches in Singapore. It's serve steamboat. I order chicken soup and tasty pickle soup. It's good. I also ordered Australia beef which is good. Fish glue is soft, crispy bean curd and crispy fish skin is ok. I order yam, sweet corn and some vegetables. Price is $90 for 3 pa

I visited Shi Li Fang today about 1830. The place is very colorful and vibrant. There are 6-8 soup bases for us to choose and we had tomato and preserved vegetables. The tomato soup is pretty mediocre, nothing to shout about. The preserved vegetables soup is not bad with a hint of spiciness and sour. The superior black Pork slices are not as tender as I thought it would be. It might not be freshly cut but frozen. The speciality chicken is pretty average. Maybe I cook it in the tomato soup hence the marinating is washed out by the soup. The fried bean curd skin is average but the fried fish skin is good. I soak it in the tomato soup and it absorbs the essence of the soup while it remains crispy. Nice I had the free flow drink with additional of 60c which is reasonable. They had free flow of barley, lime, lemon tea, chestnut and blueberry as well as hot tea such as Long Jing, Tie Guan Ying and Pu Er. The condiments are good especially the special sesame sauce.

An executive summary: it’s pricey and the food isn’t even that great likened to “corporate catering,” it’s merely expensive food without a narrative.Shi Li Fang is a Taiwanese steamboat joint which is misleading with hidden costs, serves mediocre food and service that sucks. Be wary. Be very wary.I ultimately concluded that “you probably shouldn’t eat at this place.” This is the true truth as I say it as it is

We went to the one at City square mall near little India. On 2nd floor next to Decathalon store. Staff were friendly and helpful in explaining the options. We ordered the set meal at $9.90. Some meat, lots of veg, choice of drinks and soup.The interesting thing here was they have a robot serving us. Tip: order the la mien and watch the staff pull the noodle for you.

My children love to dine here, cos they can redeeem some soft toys after dining there. My Wife and I enjoyed the value for money set meal available, and we usually visit the outlet in Chinatown Point, cos it's nearer to us. But our last visit was a rather disappointing, cos we find that the soup quality has changed

1st time dine in here at j-avenue J-Cube branch.We come here due to pikachu stand in front of this restaurant and appearance of this restaurant quite cute and my son like it.We order collagen chicken and mala soup base. The chicken soup is quite nice while the mala soup damn spicy. We order some ingredients like premium chicken slice, prawn, cheese tofu, pok tenderloin etcThey provide some variety of sauces and condiments that make the dish taste better as the other steamboat restaurantQuite pricey and the price of those all you can eat buffet seems better as in total dine in here will be slightly more expensiv
