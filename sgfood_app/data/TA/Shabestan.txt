Food here is hearty and tasty! Authentic Mediterranean food and not pretentious at all, compared to other Mediterranean restaurants. Service is good. We‚Äôll be back!
5
Very nice place, good food, excellent service, lots of options and menu choices, the only disappointment is the restaurant is very expensive when compared to other Persian restaurants.
4
Had the starters platter that features the best hummus, pureed egg plants and homemade cheese.
Our kebabs were amazing too. Especially the tender and perfectly grilled Lamb Chops!
5
The food is pricy, just like any other restaurant in Singapore, but it‚Äôs delicious. Everything we ordered tasted great. Highly recommend!

There is no doubt in our minds that Shabestan offers the best Middle Eastern food in Singapore. üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª

Superb food, good service. Recommended both for private and business opportunities. Both the lamb course and beef course tastes delicious.
5
Went with wife for meal. Was not disappointed. Service was discreet and attentive. Had Gulf Salad. Refreshing. Meat platter of chicken and beef came with fluffy bismati rice. Meat was succulent and done to perfection. Rice? Light enough to float on air and tasted sublime enough to make me feel likewise ‚Äì airborne. Looking forward to returning.

This time decided to stroll around on robertson quay (other than clarke quay) and find some good restaurant offering vegetarian food (has always been a tough task when travelling since having turned vegetarian).Firstly i liked their sitting and it was not over crowded. Luckily it was 7.30 pm Friday when they have a belly dancing show at the restaurant. Their staff was nice and courteous and the food quality was excellent. Overall great experience and reasonably priced - not over the top expensive
3
On the quay, a small and nice restaurant with outdoor seating, perfect with this kind of mild weather.The service was professional, courteous and pleasant indeed.Nice Persian dishes, the selection of appetizers was good and generous,the minced marinated lamb was great.The bread is great too and the rice was good too.A nice dinner indeed
4
We had lunch there today along the river. I‚Äôve been 3 or 4 times and the food is always tasty, the welcome good and service with a smile. We came with a pram and that was no problem. We waited a little bit for the food to come but in my books, it‚Äôs a good thing: you know that what you eat will be freshly made.
3
Pleasant Bar Restaurant overlooking canal. 2 cocktails for about $20 until 7pm. Avoid the sullen waitress at front of house who did not tell us that the cocktails we ordered were not on their half price list. Luckily, her manager was more reasonable.
5
First off, the meal was superb. The lamb and chicken were juicy and tender while the prawn was so fresh. The staffs are accomodating and tend to every requests. The place is nice for photos as well.
5
Having a dinner here for party of 5, my first time visited this place. And OH MY....food was absolutely tasty from my roasted eggplant appetizer till mains, food speak it self.
Love the ambience
4
The location of the restaurant is definitely its USP. Combined with that the food is quite authentic and the service is warm and friendly. The Muhamara and Homemade cheese that we had for starters along with Iranian bread was well made and quite delicious.We ordered the Sabzi kebab for mains which is a charcoal grilled assortment of vegetables along with biryani rice. The zucchini and the asparagus were to die for! Topped it up with some saffron ice cream and without hesitation, this was one of the best I have ever had
5
Great place to sit down near the river at Robertson Quay. This is a rather unspoilt territory when it comes to tourists so you won't have brats running around shouting and wailing.Theyve got outdoor seating under roof in case it rains and their food is great!Try their homemade olivesalad as a sider. I can recommend everything on their menu. Staff is quick, polite and very friendly too. We came back several times, and will be back later too.Too bad they don't have the belly dancer anymore though!
5
My husband & I have had a 36 hour stop over in Singapore, flying on to Surabaya early tomorrow. We chose a sharing platter of starters, followed by amazing falafel and stuffed vine leaves. We are not vegetarians, but thoroughly enjoyed these meatless dishes. Highly recommend this Persian restaurant. The waiters were friendly and helped us choose. Thank you. A memorable meal.
5
One of the best middle eastern food in Singapore. Food taste is authentic... The restaurant is centrally located with easy access. The menu looks confusing however staff explained us the difference between the dishes which helped us make our choices. Vegetarian options are limited. Option to book your table online
5
We were walking along Robertson‚Äôs Walk looking for a place to lunch and chanced upon this restaurant. Although they had outdoor seating we decided to sit in due to the hot and humid afternoon. No regrets sitting indoors ... the decor, music, ambience n especially the decorative lamps, brought us from Singapore to an exotic place. We ordered their signature hummus(served with Iranian bread) and the lamb kubideh(served with basmati rice). Both were wonderfully delicious. There was a 1 for 1 cider promotion and the cider went down well with the meal. A must try place if you are in Robertson‚Äôs Quay vicinity.
5
Visited Shabestan for dinner and my first ever Persian food!How do they do it! Simply fabulous. The tenderest meat I have ever eaten delicately flavoured beautifully presented by extremely nice waiter! Eating out along the Quay in the warmest of evenings is heavenly and I highly rate and recommend this place
3
I have to say ambience is worth 5 stars! The indoor deco and it's set by the riverside.Service was top-notch. Very good serviceUnfortunately was really disappointed by the food.Prices are certainly expensive considering the location and the restaurant is definitely leaning towards fine dining,Thus we expected food to be of better quality.One side note, our glasses had a funny smell, the waiter quickly got us new glasses promptly and a new bottle of sparkling water.Thereafter which we were charged for 2 bottles of sparkling waterPersonally I felt, they could have given us a complimentary bottle of water as a kind gesture.Oh wells.I guess it's a place for foreigners rather than locals
5
Food was great. We just couldn‚Äôt do justice to it after taking the vegetarian platter. Got too full.
5
The food was amazing and the staff were very attentive . We enjoyed Shah Pasand Chicken and Shabestan Mojito. Food arrived quickly . We enjoyed best hospitality..
5
This was very happening restaurant at Riverside.The staff were positive, interactive and committed to excellence.The food full of saffron and Persian spices flavour. We ordered appetiser platter and mix standard platter . We had lovely evening .
5
Excellent kebabs! . Ht bread was fresh and meet was marinated perfectly. The taste of the food reminded me home.
5
Please try their ice cream. That is a place you can really enjoy the middle east food. We have a very good time there.
5
This is a gem, on a riverside view. Where the food with wonderful spices that will be suitable for any one.
5
We found this restaurant on Trip Advisor and it was in walking distance from where we staying. Weren't overly hungry so ordered the platter for two and hommus. Absolutely delicious and just what we wanted. Not being dessert eaters the waiter suggested the pastachio ice cream which we shared and it was delicious. Thank you for a wonderful meal
5
Whether you would like to taste exotic Persian cuisine, have a glimpse on middle east atmosphere or just hungry for the best meat in town - visiting Shabestan is right thing to do. It is located in the amazing part of Singapore, River valley, accessible from any part of the city. The environment is awesome, with persian lamps, nice decoration and spacious hall, can enjoy aircon or fresh air outside. Sometimes there are belly dancers performances. Alcohol is available in a good choice, either wine, beer or even stronger options. And FOOD, food is excellent, meat is so tender and juicy, always fresh, cooked right infront of you. Variety is great as well, barely several restaurants in iran will offer so many options. Ghorme sabzi is excellent and totally must try, kebabs and starters are amazing. Go, treat yourself. Shabestan is perfect for a business lunch, family gathering, or a surprise diner for your loved one
5
If you want to feel home,,Shabestan might be the place that suits your cravings for a fine Persian cuisine..exact scenery, perfect location and your desired atmosphere as you indulged the dishes they offer..value for money, you will never regret.Once in a life time experience. I would say it√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s a must try when you visit Singapore =
5
The rain didn't dampen our dining experience here at Shabestan. The food that we ordered were all spot on. The Appetizer platter were great for sharing among 5 of us. Tried the muhamara (pomegranate paste) that tasted awesome. The assorted BBQ platter for 4 had such great yummy succulent meats that were still juicy and tender. We also had the okra stew to go with the rice for extra gravey. But my personal favourite was the duck. It's was spot on in the tenderness of the meat and flavours. The staffs were really friendly and the surrounding atmospheric of the river and lighting made our dining experience a memorable one. Job well done guys
4
We have been there several times with colleagues. This time we brought our clients and they are enjoying their foods and full of praise.
3
Does well to specialise and serve in Persian. Cuisine in the heart of Robertson quay They try and serve authentic fare and kebabs are very good. Good staff
5
Awesome food + Great service = Fantastic evening....
9 of us went and we had great time at the restaurant.
Have good selection of wines.
Recommend you to take Shabestan Platters....

This is a nice Persian restaurant in the Clarke Quay area. The setting is attractive, and the staff are pleasant and service is prompt.
We had the lamb chops, and the lamb and chicken shish kebabs - both were very good.
5
Staff ‚Äì most helpful and made welcome even though we arrived at 11 PM.Great feeling about the restaurant and brought back memories of the middle eastFood ‚Äìwe enjoyed a platter for two with lamb, chicken, prawns and all the usual trimmings. Excelent taste as you would expect from this quality restaurant.Value ‚Äì a liitle expensive but this is Singapore.Overall ‚Äì would recommend to others and would definitely return. Great outlook across the quay
5
I was invited to a dinner at Shabestan, and first time trying Persian cuisine.Food were great, especially grilled meat kebabs... Full of flavour at every bite! Saffron ice cream and Turkish tea were delightful! Love the starter as well as pita bread. Highly recommended to go for the Sunday brunch to taste the best of all of everything on the menu! Thank you Mr Madan and his team for the great hospitality and food introduction.
5
I have only heard of Persian food but was blown away by the excellent fare in this restaurant. had the Chicken Masti & Fish Kebab which were presented on a bed of rice & cheese topped salad. What a taste! The staff was also very considerate that we had an infant & went out of the way to make us feel comfortable. a Must visit
5
Great place at Robertson Walk. Good place for the family too. The kebabs and all on the grill were absolutely divine! The stater chef platter was 5 stars!!! The bread along with it was perfect!! Kebabs Lamb grill- 5 starsPrawn Grill - 5 starsFish grill - 4 starsBeef grill - 4 starsStaff and service was very good! Well run place!
4
I was unsure of veggie options when a friend booked this place for dinner. But was I surprised! There's so much for veggies.I'd recommend Muhamara & Hummus with Iranian bread. The Sabzi Polo ( Biriyani!) is the Iranian version I thought I'd try. But it's no patch on Lucknow Biryani we're used to. Service was decent. Btw, my meat-eating friends said the food was grea
2
This restaurant is located in a posh part of Singapore. The service was good. I would not consider this as Authentic. The koobideh is more your classic indian sikhkebab we ordered 5 mains and one appetiser and bottle of Aussie wine at 60. The portions were tiny and the total came to around 370 . Way over priced for what you get. AVOID
4
The restaurant captain made some good suggestions that enable us to savor a variety of Persian cuisines.
5
An excellent romantic dinner with a phenomenal menu! Service very friendly and very kind and warm. The food was just exquisite, very tender lamb stew. and lamb grill.
Certainly a place to come back for a very special occasion.
4
Dinner at a Persian restaurant by the Singapore river. This area is more relaxed than other parts of Singapore and it has got a great view of the river from our outside table. I love their great foods, too.
4
We had diner (starter/maincourse). Starter (appetiser platter) was excellent, the main course ( a kebab dish) was a bit disappointing. It failed to surprise me. Very friendly service.
5
Just went in not knowing what to expect and we were so pleased we did. The food was amazing!! The staff were so accommodating and friendly.... We will definitely be going back there on our next visit to Singapore.
3
Service was relatively good, though you often needed to get the waiter's attention. Quality of food was good but the let down is just really high prices. Enough that the value for money equation is a real let down. Certainly good ingredients, but Clarke quay tourist prices keep moving further upriver.
5
Walking through the restaurant precinct with many choices we came across Shabestan. After viewing the menu at the front and chatting with the Manager we were shown to a table overlooking the water. Sensational food, brilliant service and a gorgeous setting. Great wine choices also. The pricing reflects a fine dining experience which we were happy to pay. Staff members Madan and Karan get a special mention for service beyond expectations.
5
Delicious food and fabulous service. We had the Shabestan platter for 2 consisting of fish, prawn, lamb and beef with several types of rice. The flavours were mouth watering and the service impeccable. This was topped off by saffron and pistachio ice cream. A welcome relief from some of the tourist style that dominates
1
We ordered the Ghormeh Sabzi $32 and khoresht- Bamieh $32 which was incorrectly served as Khoresh-e-Gh $30. Neither dish was as described or consistent with the photos. Both dishes were bland. The lamb dish was described as being with fresh vegetables which were not present. The chicken dish had a tiny amount of chicken which was overwhelmed by the eggplant. The service was overly pushy bordering on bullying
4
As vegetarians, we still found plenty to eat at this pleasant restaurant with friendly service staff. We ordered falafel as a starter and an okra stew as the main dish. Preceded by a complimentary serving of flat bread and salad, this was more than adequate for our small appetites, and it tasted great. Had intended to try the baklava for dessert but couldn't manage it
5
Shabestan serve good persian food. It is the best persian food in Singapore. It is a bit expensive but would be good for your special days. They have belley dance on friday and saturday night which is average.
5
It was quiet on a Saturday lunch time but we had a great experience. The food was very authentic, service was attentive and sitting outside by the river was great!
5
A famous food and big quantity. Never desapointed! Nice place with honest price and large menu. Have to go!
3
Service slow to begin but speedy once food was selected. Should have chose indoor seating as fans were not adequate to cope with Singapore heat and humidity.
4
This is the first time our family visited Shabestan or try any middle eastern cuisine. I looked up on the food view before booking through Chope & it didn't disappoint us. The food was very good & staff were friendly. Will definitely come again.
4
This is a beautiful place in Robertson Quay and the service is very good. Food is lovely too. Extensive menu, good choices for vegetarians, nice seating options.
2
Went for dinner with family. Despite being half empty, it took 15 mins before some one could help us with the table. Menu is very overpriced and portion sizes of the mezze are too small especially humus Shirazi salad was tasteless while lamb kofta had a predominent smell of lamb which turns you off as a diner who does not relish the smell. Belly dancer was a joke and barely anyone was watching her performOverall a big hole in pocket with $150++ bill without any drinks or mocktailsWill definetly not recommend this place. The restaurant in holland village is far better in both quality of food and service if you have to pay same amount of mone
4
Located on Singapore's lively Robertsons Quay, Shabestan is an authentic Persian restaurant serving Persian and other Middle Eastern specialities. The Mezzes and vegetarian entrees are great, and the grilled platters are perfect for sharing, especially good is the grilled mixed platter featuring lamb cutlets, minced lamb, beer, chicken and tiger prawns interspersed with vegetables. Sit outside under the fans in the balmy tropical night air and watch the World go past on Robertsons quay. The belly dancing to the pre-recorded blaring music is a bit irritating however, especially if this is a business dinner
4
We were staying close by to the Shabestan Persian Restaurant, Robertson Quay, and whenever we walked by this restaurant it was always pretty full. We found the food very enjoyable and a meat-lover's paradise with lamb a standout. Sumac spice was served with our meal and was a lovely addition, as was the rice bread. The service was very good and our waitress provided assistance when working our way through the extensive menu.There is seating available outside or inside in the air conditioning. It is at the pricey end of the scale but we were looking for a special restaurant on that particular night and were not disappointed. Interestingly there are a couple of further cafes/restaurants owned by the family located at Ngee Ann City (PITA Tree) and at ION Orchard (Tazeh) if you are not close to Robertson Quay. Each location has it's own menu. Definitely worth a try
4
I've been at Shabestan twice now, the food is good, yet a bit overpriced, I think. I might be hard to please in terms of Persian cuisine, but this being South-East Asia and probably not all ingredients are available, it is good food.We really liked the Mast a lot, it tasted like home. Also the Ghrome Sabzi was delicious and so were the Olives. The Jujeh Kebab was a bit weak in both lime and Saffron, I think.There is not much authentic Persia in the place, however...Special thanks to Edy, who was a very kind, helpful and attentive waiter to us
5
I loved the food in Shabestan restaurant and all the dishes are very special and delicious.
Their kebabs are amazing and i wont get bored eating everyday here :)
4
THe food was sumptuous and tasty. We enjoyed every mouthful. Our guestes enjoyed it too. All in all we had a great time
4
We ate here one night while staying at the nearby Park Hotel. The food was delicious, the service was excellent. What more could you ask of a restaurant.
4
Popped in for a light lunch at this well located restaurant overlooking the river. Outdoor space is well ventilated and there is plenty of indoor air conditioned seating. The service was prompt, courteous and the food was very good at relatively moderate price given the location in Singapore. Worth a try if you are staying in one of the many hotels located nearby
4
Had evening meal here, we weren't sure what to order and the waitress/waiter came to our rescue...they recommended the platter for four people (we were with friends) and it was fantastic, different meats, kebabs, king prawns, vegetables, breads, so, so tasty and beautifully presented. It was a set price and was very well worth it. The restaurant is in a lovely position on the river bank though difficult to get a table outside, we ate inside and was glad cos it was a lot cooler
5
Fianc√© bought me to try out Persian food which looks kinda weird to me. But after i have tried their appetiser which is the hummus and pita, my mindset has changed! Simply loved the pita and hummus. Plus ordering the grilled mixed platter for 2 (kebabs) was totally amazing! Loved the prawns, mutton and all! Finally we end our meal with an traditional Persian dessert! Of cause to compliment all the dishes, we called One Persian ruby and one cider. Will definitely try the other dishes next time!! ‚ô•

I have struggled to find a decent Middle eastern restaurant in Sg. Having lived in ME and close to the ME area of London, I have been used to quality.I wanted a meat feast and that is what the two of us ordered. In truth the meat was pretty good. But it was expensive and so we expected the usual things with it. Remember this is between 2.An small starter, one tiny piece of cheese, 3 small olives, spring onion greens and a small piece of thin bread. Come on guys.Main, the meat was just about enough, but it was good quality. There was masses of rice which in fairness was of good quality. One (between the two of us), thin piece of bread - there should be ample of this if truly ME.Salad with it - one lone tomato, one v small chilli paper, a few small lettuce leave. Talk about misery.We ordered Humus and got no bread.No ME coffee, the cup I got tasted like out of a cheap machine.To top it all the sparkling water was Badoit - if I wanted to drink brine, I would drink out of Kallang.For $180 Sg, it was a total rip off. More salad, decent entr√© and bread by the bucket load and I would be back. But maybe I just have to save ME food until I return to London. Better Quality, more accompanying the meat and 3 times cheaper
3
Came here whilst on a 3 day stopover on way home from Australia. We were staying at Park Hotel, & this place was nearby, we'd had Italian the night before so fancied something different. Great looking menu, ordered a starter each, which were good& quite large. I ordered chicken masti for main, & it looked delicious, started eating it, & then looked at the chicken at the other end & it was quite literally raw in the middle. Told a waiter who apologised & took it away, brought some very salty cheese & tomato with a whole bread to keep me going, which I really didn't want, came back & apologised again, saying the kitchen was very smokey due to the char grilling, that's why chef hadn't seen it was raw. Finally brought it out, but to be honest I really didn't enjoy it after that!!! Got charged the full amount, which I never mind paying for food if it's good, but thought we may get discount. Also there is 10% service charge, + 7% GST charge, although this is common in all eating places as Far as I'm aware
3
I ate here having being attracted by the idea of home made Persian food and delights...but honestly felt it was not that special considering there are so many locals here who could do better....The Hummus (which is actually Egyptian) was bland and rather tasteless, (but the bread was good) and the large majority of the dishes are drained in Saffron - it may look nice and yellow but to my tastes are at least is strange ...it would be nice to get some food without saffron all over it...even the rice which comes without was cooked in a saffron pan...uck!Otherwise, friendly enough, nice location - but I would not bother agai
4
Dined on Saturday night. Service good although waiter perplexed by corkscrew. Good selection of wines. Pleased to see our French red presented at a correct temperature and was well worth the price. Wine never a cheap choice in Singapore. Menu was extensive. Both dishes chosen lived up to expectations. Good ambience. Passersby added to vibe but unlike at Clarke quay, were not over whelming. Would visit agai
5
We had so much fun among family and friends last time we went there. Great food and fantastic and close attention to our needs by the courteous staff there. Congratulations
5
Very helpful and friendly staff.
The whole meal for me and a colleague: Starters and Mains was delicious and different.
1
Shabby appalling service. the location is nice by the river and the decor is nice but the service lets the place down completely. food is nice but it is not worth it to put up with such service sadly.
5
My family of six had dinner there on Chinese New Year eve. GM suresh Menon helped us select the dishes he knew we would enjoy and all the waiters were attentive with our every request!
5
Visited with my office colleagues. The place was nice. Good ambience. Friendly staff. Kebabs and appetisers were delicious .
Good to experience it.
5
Went for lunch the other day with my Husband on our last day in Singapore. We had a wonderful time the food was fantastic and the service by Sophie was wonderful.. She was Super Friendly and she gave us good suggestions on our meal! Definitely will go back when we are back in Singapore!
4
We visited this restaurant on a stopover in Singapore. The food was delightful and the staff Karan and Ken, along with their colleagues were helpful, courteous and polite. Our starters of hoummus & a light & fragrant tomato & cucumber salad were so tasty. The mains of beef and lamb fillets were simply melt in the mouth flavoursome and gorgeous! We washed our meal down with an Argentinian Malbec which was amazing too. It was my wife's birthday and the lovely manager and his team provided a surprise birthday cake as a gift. Such a kind gesture from the manager & his team. Overall, a delightful evening with terrific food, warm service and welcoming & knowledgeable staff. Well done and thank you. Highly recommended

My husband and I went here on a Thursday evening for a meal. The restaurant was lacking in atmosphere but given it was a weekday. The staff seated us on a table that was meant for four people and when I asked if we could move to a smaller, more personal table, i was told no as the chairs were slightly wet. Ten minutes later another member of staff wiped them down but we weren't offered the table. Next the waiter came and put on a large fan right by me and in line with my head without even asking if it was ok, i was infact too cold with it on and had to move to sit at the side of the table. The meal of one sharing starter plate of hummus and other persian dips and two meat kebab meals came to $170, my husband had one small beer and I only drank a soft drink. No-one asked if the meal was ok, if we needed more water or seemed atall interested in us (Infact I thought one member of staff appeared outright rude) They were however, very interested in doing all this when the bill came! My gripe is more with the service than anything else, however I didn't feel the food's taste warranted such a high bill. The hummus starter selection was delicious, the kebabs were ok, but we didn't think they were anything special. We wouldn't go there again and would aim to find somewhere more reasonably priced and friendly
1
What an experience! Went there with my family (including our two year old) on Sunday night for dinner. We were really looking forward to some Persian cuisine! Unfortunately it looks like the restaurant had other plans for us. Our drinks (a Tiger draft) and a cocktail were served like almost 45 minutes after ordering! The food, though, never made it even after an hour of patient waiting and asking our server. When we finally approached the manager, the excuse was that with Chinese New Year, all the full timers were on leave. Surprisingly that didn't seem to affect other diners who ordered after us and managed to get their food served!The worst part of the experience was probably the manager telling us-" I am apologizing to you out of courtesy"... as if, the fact that the food hadn't come out even after an hour was of little consequence!! In any case we left the place and the manager finally comped the drinks we had...  Would have appreciated if the manager/ server had just informed us prior to ordering that it would take so much time. Really sad..
4
First time I have had Persian food and I loved it! Lively, fresh , tasty and moorish!We started with a delicate mixed salad and a mixture of light meatballs in a delicious sauce. For mains we had a dish of mixed lamb fillet and kofta style lambwith another dish of huge fresh prawns on scewers also delightful!We were looked after very well by all the staff especially Karan
4
Enjoyed the good variety of food, with good service and cosy atmosphere, but a little overpriced. Well placed for eating and quickly and start your Singapore river cruise.
5
Love the foods, love the services. Absolutely will come back here again! Anyone who comes here must try grilled kebab! Cant miss it:)
5
Just finished my dinner at Shabestan on the Singapore river. Excellent Kufte Parsi followed by a delicious Mix Kubideh Kebab.
Efficient and friendly service. Free wifi. A perfect solo evening.
5
Enjoyed two evening meals here recently. Great location on Robertson QuayThe quality of the food offering was excellent both in taste and presentation. There is a tremendous selection on the menu of 'Persian' cuisine but we particularly liked the charcoal grilled meats. The hummus starter accompanied by breads was superb.Service is friendly if a little erratic but hey what a great place to people watch on the quay and if you eat outside, to enjoy the warm evenings.Good valueWould recommend and return
5
Had an impromptu visit to Shabestan and the food and service was fab. Goats cheese for starters - melted in our mouth and was a fantastic start to the meal. The grilled lamb kebab with the home made chilli was absolutely amazing. Tender lamb meat soaking in a multitude of flavours. The happy hour wines were $9++ on a Fri afternoon and it was such an enjoyable meal. Service was on the ball and made the entire experience complete. Highly recommend if you're looking for Persian food in the little red dot
4
We were just walking by at 4:30 pm and wanted a beer and a place to smoke some cigarillos. But a very friendly hostess suggested we try some kebabs. And so we did. Koobideh first. And then soultani. Service was very quick. And we were delighted. Juicy and flavorful. Lovely rice to go with it. If you are in the area find some time to stop by here. Burp 
4
Stopped off for lunch while walking down riverbank , busy wee place .Fast service gin on the table 3 mins and brought complementary water .Good very nice and did not take long .As it was the afternoon bit to busy but was mobbed last night as I walked passed.Worth a visit
4
We ordered a mix of foods to share.The kebabs are excellent.If you like the temps, the outdoor seating provides a good variety of people walking by along the river. Very pleasant.The service was quite good, until it came time to pay. Then they seemingly lost interest in us
1
Avoid this place if you are Asian, or if you look anything that doesn't resemble white or caucasian. My wife decided to give this place a try as we are a fan of southeast asian and arab cuisine. We had been waiting for our food for 30mins when a old white couple (who looked like tourists) settled to table right next to ours and ordered the same food i did, lamb polo. It didnt take them more than 5 minutes and they were served their order, ahead of us who had been waiting for 30+ minutes. I've been living in singapore as an expat for a long time and this is the first time I fell victim to a discrimination. The worst part is, the "supervisor's" excuse was totally lame, that the white couple got their food early because they ordered it together with their appetizer, as if taking you for an idiot. In this day an age, it's a shame that people give preferential treatment to other people on the basis of their skin color. I'm telling my friends and everyone I know to avoid this place like a plague
3
Shabestan has an extensive menu with multiple options for vegetarians and omnivore, so there's brownie points for them! I was here for a business lunch and found the ambiance just perfect for it. We had an Appetizer platter to share (Hummus, Baba Ghanoush, Green Olives-Walnuts-Pomegranate, Spinach, and Dolma with Lavash) and I had a plate of Falafel as mains. The dips were all flavourful and well made, and the Falafel was just the right texture. It's definitely worth a visit
4
Excellent service! Sit outside though. The ventilation of their indoor seating wasn't good and our clothes needed a good washing after
4
Great Persian food, a bit pricey though. The lunch deal is pretty good. Nice tender kebabs, their ice cream is also a treat.
5
Just had the most amazing Sunday buffet lunch at Shabestan. Outstanding service and attention. Taste and quality of food superb!!!
Thanks guys!
5
Walking past looking for somewhere to eat we were gently talked into trying then. Glad we did as the good and service were excellent.
Reasonable prices for this area as well.
Give them a try...you might enjoy it as we did! üòä

Dropped into Shabestan for dinner and requested a table in the air-conditioned section. Warmer seating is available outdoors, but given how warm it was, I opted to sit inside. Was shown to my table in less than a minute. Picked a couple of starters and a main dish; and a Shabestan mojito to quench my thirst. The mojito arrived rapidly, alongside my hummus and Iranian bread.The mojito was very different with a rich pomegranate flavour, and the usual suspect, mint. It would serve well to accompany dinner.The hummus was fine and generously doused with olive oil. The Iranian bread was fluffy and complemented the hummus well. Took awhile for the wings to appear. Again, great barbecue taste and flavour - hit the spot. This is where things went slightly amiss. My mains appeared before I could finish my starter. I would have preferred it remain in the warmer kitchen space instead of plopped at my side. The main dish itself was a selection of chicken and lamb kebabs with rice. It was tasty, and filled with flavour.Service was good overall, not outstanding. Attention to detail was a bit poor: I was asked how things were going, when I had a full mouth - on 2 separate occasions, but 2 different members of staff.My only other complaint: the owner took pains to visit a number of tables, but skipped mine - perhaps because I dined alone, or perhaps I did not look "uppity" enough. Whatever the reasons, I should have liked to pass on my best wishes in person, but alas it was not to be.Overall, it was a good dinner - and I wish I had saved some room for dessert. Perhaps next time

Good service and very nice food. We went for a friend's birthday and enjoyed our time there. The hummus and mahamara in appetizers is good. We also order 4 of the 5 vegetarian main courses available. The dolma was average but we loved the subz bolna (biryani). They also have some good hours for happy hours

As a regular consumers of IndoPak / Thai / Chinese food this was our first ever Persian food restaurant visit. Very enjoyable , lots of different flavours. Food quality and presentation was excellent. Service was very efficient and friendly. Pity there are no Persian restaurants in our home town
4
We were staying near Robertson Quay and wandered past Shabestan in the evening looking for somewhere to have dinner. The menu, displayed outside looked very interesting so we went in. It was hard to choose from the array of varied dishes and we all enjoyed our meals although several were really too large. Even the vegan in our group was able to find something to eat and that isn't always easy in Singapore.Service was excellent and the restaurant's ambience was most attractive
4
Don't be fool by the quiet ambient. I would say this is a undiscovered gem. Lamb is a must try. The meat is really tender and roasted to perfection. It's my first Persian cuisine in Singapore (even for a local) and this would be the last. The duck is another must try.
5
Robertson Walk and Clarke Quay spoil a traveller for choice when it comes to eating out. Yes, it is a little touristy in these areas, but hey, I'm a tourist. We were roaming around Robertson Walk trying to figure out what to ave for dinner. We cam across this restaurant and as we had never had persian food before, thought about giving it a try. So glad we did. The food was beautifully prepared and cooked. The flavours were strong without being overpowering. The serving sizes were large and we had trouble eating everything, which was Sabz Polo and Soltani. The restaurant overlooks the Singapore river and the nioght-time lights add a little romance into the mix. You can sit there and watch the world go by. Tables were available inside or outside and the decor was very good. Plenty of things to look at. Two drinks and the food came to S$92. It was well worth it
4
Whilst walking along the river last night we stopped at this resturant for a drink and meal.
Happy hour prices for drinks where good. Food was fresh and most enjoyable
Location looking over the river was very pleasant. Service was fine.
4
Good place especially for gastronomic adventurers. Exotic persian cuisine with some really great tastes. The kebab platters were just amazing. Good options for the vegeterians also.
3
The restaurant is good. The food is good. it was a normal family outing, without any occasion and although we have had lebanese food earlier, we had never tried Persian (Are they same?). So, we tried this restaurant. here's a succinct review:Pros:1. Good location. Robertson quay.2. Good service. Friendly staff.3. Decent food.Cons:1. For a normal outing and just 3 dishes amongst 4 people, i think it was a bit pricey
5
Our 5th time to Shabestan and still our favorite resturant in Singapore. Great selection of Persian grill with gorgeous spices. Situated on the river, they're is usually a nice breeze and if not you can sit inside with aircon. I had the beef marinated in yogurt and my daughter had the 4 lamb chops (see below). Neither of us finished given the size of the servings. Love this place
5
What a great place to spend your evening with friends and experience the wonderful taste of Persian food and cosine. Service is amazing. Everyone is very friendly and the owner always gives us the warm welcome every time we are there. This is really taste of Persia away from Persians Land. Kebabs are delicious and meat really is tender and melts in your mouth. Magic recipes!! We always feel that we are home away from home!! Try and you will experience this yourself!
4
Shabestan is one of the better middle eastern restaurants in Singapore. I liked the lamb leg, basmati rice, and the appetizer platter. The lamb leg was soft and fell of the bone. However, the grill was a little bit dry. Interestig saffron ice dessert. Quite pricy.
4
was in singapore on a buisness trip and dropped in Shabestan. experienced very good sevice, reached very late but they were kind enough to take orders. also helped us in chosing the right dish for 3. mixed kebab platter was awesome!!! will get back with more time in hand to taste other items!!!
4
We got to taste a bit of everything when one of the staff (Karam) suggested the platter for 2. The meat was juicy and tender but I particularly liked the prawn kebab, it was very tasty! The dish went well with the mast (persian yoghurt), awesomely refreshing!The Faludeh Shirazi has become my new favorite dessert! Would love to return to try other dishes
4
I had opportunity to test this restaurant three times my during business trip in Singapore. Every time service was excellent and staff was most helpful. Service was smooth even though we had group of seven and a week after group of eight. Food was little different than other restaurants at the same area. True flavors from Persia. Highly recommended
5
We are staying in Singapore and wanted to taste different food. In the afternoon we stopped to look at the menu and a very helpful lady explained what was special about the food.In the evening we went back to try the restaurant. We were not disappointed. The food was similar to Lebanese in the flavours and spices they use. The staff gave us time to choose but were ready with explanantions if required, they were not pushy but attentive. We shared their mixed platter starter of five different small helpings, so many flavours. This was followed by two different dishes again, very well presented and full of flavours. The meal finished with sharing an ice cream and a bahklava. Again we were very pleased with our choices. We will go again if we come to SIngapore another time. I must add there was also a Belly Dancer on whom I cannot comment because it was the first time I had seen such a show, but the lady got a round of applause from the other diners there
5
Great restaurant with a lovely ambience. Food is excellent. The service from Karan was amazing. You should definitely visit if you are in Singapore.
5
Excellent selection of Persian fare. We went for kababs and lamb stew with Pulao. The service was quick. They have ample of seating. Outside seating by the water side was great. Great place to relax.
4
The food was good and the rice also, so as the servants were very kind and respectful it a great restaurant for Muslim people who are trying to find halal food but not so good for those who are in a budget ..
3
Went there with a group of friends. Food was ok but were really disappointed with the serving size, specially when you spend so much. It is an expensive restaurant!Unless you are restricted by the cuisine, i recommend going to other nearby restaurants
4
Lovely middle eastern food in a good riverside location. We took advice from the excellent waitress who suggested some dishes. She got amount of food just right - I'm sure I would have over ordered the portions are big. a range of halal & veggie options. Good wine list. Inside and outside tables available. We will retur
4
Of course, we ordered the hummus and bread to start with! In no time, the hummus was done. It tasted really great with the bread! We also ordered the bbq chicken wings, just for fun (not very Persian!!)The waiter was very kind to tell us ahead of time that the portions aren't exactly small. One portion can feed 2. The platter of 2 we ordered could feed 3 - 4 persons! True enough, portions were huge! But food was delicious! The fish was tender and juicy. So were the prawns. The chicken and beef fillet were good. But at the end of it all, we were all stuffed!!! Good food. Will definitely come back. It's a good place because even for a Sat night, the place is not packed like in the nearby Clarke Quay!! Like it just that way
4
We sat outside to eat and thoroughly enjoyed the ambience overlooking the river. The choice of food was excellent, and the quality of what we ate did not disappoint, Service was also excellent so all in all this was a very positive experience that we would repeat
5
This was a great choice for dinner and we found it hard to select with so many tempting things on the menu. We enjoyed Halim Baddemjan (pureed aubergine with lamb and green lentils) and hummus with tasty bread for starters, both were delicious. To follow we had Javaher polo with chicken (slow-cooked chicken and rice with nuts and berries) and Koresh-e-Fesenjan ba Ordak (Caspian style braised duck with walnut and pomegranate sauce). The food was beautifully presented and looked stunning, it also tasted great and we struggled to finish after eating too much of the complimentary bread earlier on. The crushed mint lime soda is a refreshing mocktail which went well with the food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for its setting, food and service
5
The Shabestan offers delicious Persian food in Singapore. The choices were plenty and all dishes we tried were copious and very tasty. Service was efficient and friendly. Outdoor seating is lovely, but if you find the humidity too much and prefer the AC, then indoor is also nicely decorated, and very clean.I would definitely be back on future visits to Singapor
4
I was on a 3-day business trip to Singapore and I tried my luck by dropping by the restaurant at nearly 3pm, not sure whether the kitchen was ready or has closed. Glad to find out that it is opened at 3pm. I ordered the vegetarian meal and had humus as the starter, which was served with very delicious light bread sprinkled with sesame seeds which was awesome. The supervisor was very attentive and friendly. Highly recommended for vegetarians if you are at this part of the island since most kitchens start their operation in the evening, or have a rest in bewteen lunch and dinner
4
Really enjoyed the dinner we had with another couple. Always fabulous food, great service and lovely view along the river.
4
Good Persian food. Good location. Fairly busy on weekends. Though the service on a busy evening let's you down.
5
Group dinner at Shabestan - delicious!! We come multiple times when in Singapore - it's awesome - the platters and hummus are perfect to share!!
4
We stuck to the tried and trusted hommos, falafel and grilled chicken/lamb. We found the food very good, and the service of a high standard. Sharing a main meal together with an entree each is plenty to fill up on. We found eating outside had more ambience than eating inside
5
We have been coming to Shabestan for three years now and the food has been consistently delicious. Situated along the charming Singapore River, the restaurant offers relaxing views and high-quality Persian food. The service is also to be commended with the chef's attentive warmth and the staff's friendly disposition. Definitely check this place out for dinner if you want something fulfilling and tasty‚Äìmy personal recommendations would be the hummus, the berry pollo as well as the eggplant and mint dish
5
First time trying Persian cuisine. Did not disappoint at all.We ordered the Kufte Parsi, Soup E-Jow, Mixed Kubideh Kebab & Chicken Masti..For drinks we had Mojito & a pot of Persian Tea..Kufte Parsi had 4 meatballs in total, 2 different types, one was pomegranate and the other was saffron flavoured. As appetisers, they were kinda filling. Preferred the saffron flavoured one over the pomegranate one.Soup E-Jow was ok..Did not expect much from it though..Had chicken and barley in there..Since we were sharing the 2 mains, they arranged to bring the rice and the meat separately. The chicken masti was really nice..We could clearly taste the yoghurt that was used to marinate the chicken.The mixed kubideh kebab came with lamb and chicken.. Both of them were packed with flavour..It came with rice, which we did not manage to finish since the portion of the kebabs were quite big..Only negative point is the price. It's pretty expensive and only worth going there on a really special occasion.
4
This was our first visit to Shabestan. We are vegetarians and the choice was plenty. We ordered many dishes and the falafel was particularly good. Platter of dips with bread was also very yummy!We also ordered the Veg Kababs but the choice of veg in the dish was not interesting. Also, the egg plant was raw. Rice that was served as part of the Veg Kebab was very tasty. Saffron ice cream for dessert was exceptional!

This restaurant is so good I ate here TWICE in one week. The restaurant is located right along the river; it's a great spot for people-watching. About half the tables are outside, under the stars, and the other half are in a very elegant dining room. This is quality establishment ‚Äî¬†tablecloths and linen napkins. I found the staff to be very cordial, very well-trained and fun as well. I am surprised by the vituperation evinced by "Worldtravellers777" and "ChrisJR2013" who feel the staff is not up to par; "ChrisJR2013" went on to say this is the worst middle eastern food in Singapore. I could not disagree more.Look at these photos: delicious lamb, beautiful cooked chicken, handsomely presented beef. My duck was good but not as fine as the other dishes; that's OK; not even Babe Ruth hit a home run every time at bat. The appetizers were terrific; and I particularly point out the appetizer that features lamb and eggplant "meatballs" ‚Äî almost a dinner in itself and wonderfully subtle flavors. The only suggestion I might make would be that the wine list is a bit over-priced; $140 for a ordinary red seems a bit steep; I would expect to pay $50-60 in the USA for similar quality. All in all, I look forward to returning
5
Went there for our 8th month anniversary and was genuinely taken aback by the level of service. The lady 'boss' was extremely friendly and helpful, providing guidance to their extensive menu when we couldn't decide! She also kindly arranged for a bit of a 'break' between the starters and mains which was great but also rather suspenseful. The food was the amazing part, The chicken and beef was cooked to absolute perfection, the eggplant stew was flavourful. We left very satisfied and full. The price was reasonable considering the quality delivered and we were given a table by the river which just topped things off! It was slightly humid but then again, it's Singapore and the heatwave season to top it off - the restaurant did their best by providing a fan for alfresco diners. Lovely experience and would go back again
3
We live in the area and decided to check out this place. Though pricey, the food was good; fresh and tasty. The ambiance is touristy: neon lights in the tree, large pictures of the food on a billboard on the terrace and a large plastic sign on the walk way to attract new customers. Service was amateurish. The girl was new, but I don't think she had any previous experience or training. Did not know what she was serving only told me it was "free" when I asked her what she was serving. When I asked her again she said she did not know what it was and never came back. Set us at a table without drying the table after rain. When she brought the water just put both the glasses at the corner of the table. So the food was OK, the overall experience not so much
5
Great food! Great Service! Great Ambience! Great Affordability, Great Views! Great coffee! Great Baclava! Great all around experience!
4
Food here is great, we have ordered the grilled chicken and beef. The service here is perfect. I would really recommend this restaurant if you want to eat middle eastern food.
4
Went there a couple of times. I consider this the best Persian food in town. The mix grill is fantastic, I don't like their fish.
Good for business events, but a bit expensive for families.

This place is a joke, appalling service, rude and obnoxious staff, serving garlic laden, unedible food at rip-off tourist prices. Don't go unless you want to have a terrible experience. There's a reason this place was empty on a Saturday night when all surrounding restaurants were full. Avoid at all costs.Having read reviews on TA I had expectations that were completely dashed as they obviously just cater for misguided and uneducated tourists and rip them off with terrible service, outrageous prices and unedible food. You can always tell the quality of service my a complaint. So when I complained about my main course which was 2 prawns and half a fish laden in garlic and unedible for 38 dollars they said sorry in half hearted way but then didn't take it off the bill like any decent restaurant would have done and offer free coffee or something similar to compensate.The Singaporean manager or owner's lackey who up to that point had completely ignored us and wondered around touching up the fan and making it look as if he was doing something as the hard working Indians/Indian Singaporeans bussled about came over to us to challenge why we wanted it removed from the bill. Seemingly thinking that we were tourists there to be taken advantage of and not residents who could spread good or bad words and could come back he then argued that we should pay even though I had sent the whole meal back as it was completely unedible.This guy then tried to say that this was the taste of the middle east. This made me madder as it turned out that he'd never actually eaten in the middle east but I had. I also pointed out that i had dined at middle eastern restaurants all over the world including Singapore and no one had ever served me such disgusting garlic ridden food from London to Dubai, Egypt to Sydney. He went away in a huff after we pointed out that the customer was always right especially when the customer thought that unedible food which was sent back for 38 dollars should not be paid for. Then one of the other waiters came back and said they could reduce the bill by 20% but that still included us paying for the questionable dish. he has obviously told by the Singaporean in the white shirt to not do it.I refused point blank and said I was willing to walk away and pay nothing such was the disgust at this level of service. We now had 2 of them arguing with us standing up in the middle of a restaurant on a Saturday night as people walked past probably wondering what was going on. I could see people avoiding the place as we argued. Finally they took off. They really had no choice, but why argue when we were never going to back down? But really, the first thing they should have said was yes we'll take it off not argue for 20 minutes about it. Terrible service, some of the worst that I have experienced in Singapore, avoid at all costs especially if you're a tourist and look like easy prey to be taken advantage of. Terrible food. Even the first course was tasteless. Don't be taken in with the location, plenty of other great venues nearby. Avoid this place at all costs
4
A nice restaurant overlooking the river. We had a nice complementry starter followed by the chicken and lamb kebab which was well cooked and tasty the downside for me was that my plate was full of rice and little else. My partner had the lamb shank which he enjoyed. I found the wine and food rather overpriced. The waiter was very attentive
5
Had a delicious meal here with a friend, and I agree the food and service were excellent. Was not so busy on a Tuesday night, but apparently gets very busy later in the week. The lamb cutlets were particularly tasty, as was the chicken. Highly recommend
5
I have been here a few times and have organised work functions in their private room, also intimate dinners with the wife or close friends. Its not cheap, its expensive, however the quality of their meat and taste is the best in middle eastern food you can get in Singapore. I mean arab street food and restaurants do not even come close in comparison. Saying that, as its a little pricey, i recommend this is the place to come for special moments and i will continue that, as i love the ambience and the food
4
We often take advantage of the Shabestan's generous Happy hour drinks deals in the evening ($9 beers along that stretch of the river is very tempting) but haven't ever eaten. One evening we decided to try to food out as the table service was always friendly and efficient and the food coming out of the kitchen always looked great. The menu has a nice range of middle eastern dishes that delivered on the taste and presentation front. The service was great and the waiter really took interest in the menu, taking time to explain ingredients and recipes. The restaurant is well positioned to relax by the river and people watch at your leisure. All this does come at a cost, the price of the meal is higher than we'd usually pay but all in all as a once in awhile visit we would come again.
5
I personally went to this place as I wanted a location that doesn't serve pork for my few select friends. For the records I've been here 3 times already. First time as a pair - ordered the platter for 2. I would say it was delish. Fresh and succulent servings. But the bill did cause a bit of a heartache. Second visit was for a group of 15 people. This time we got smarter. Platter for 2 shared with 4 pax with additional entrees. We ate our fill and still had leftovers. More affordable! The third time I went back there..couple affair - The meatball was calling out to me! We had a variety of entrees and it was tasty, filling and wallet friendly!! A huge pull factor - their happy hour drinks are also of very affordable range and w a wide variety! Thumbs up!
4
We started with complimentary bread and cheese. We added humus for appetisers. Both were very good.After seeing the servings in the other table, we opted to order 2 main courses to share among the 3 of us. We ordered the mixed lamb/chix grill and the fish/prawn kebab served with salad and basmati rice. Meat and seafood were cooked just right. Tender and flavourful.We enjoyed our visit to Shabestan and will be back
5
A true middle eastern experience, the mezes were good and the meat was fabulous.
I suggest the mixed platter for a taste of the different meats.
Spicy to the right level
Dining outside on the river. With relaxed atmosphere.
5
It is very hard to find a good halal restaurant in Singapore that serves alcoholic drinks too.
We had there dinner for 20 pax.
Cosy setting, delicious food & very friendly service.
4
We arrived at noon and we were one of the first tables at the restaurant. Surprised that the restaurant offered a happy hour for drinks. Had a couple rounds of prosecco, hummus with bread, chicken wings and the chicken mince for a main. All were very good and enjoyed the patio. Quiet time to people watch. But a good stop to relax after a long walk. Service was attentive.
5
Started out with very tasty hummus paired with naan. I've been here a few times and the naan was hit and miss. At times awesome and hot, and a few times served cold. The minced kebabs are my favourite and reminds me of having the same in a small persian restaurant in London. Pricey and will only come here to treat myself
2
My husband ordered a starter which failed to arrive..Abandoning that idea we accepted the main, my husbands meal consisting of 3 cuts of Steak. I chose a falafel wrap. Having eaten the 1st medium rare requested steak my husband moved onto the 2nd piece which was only just cooked. The 3rd piece however was raw! The falafel in my the wrap was cold, crumbly dry and both of our meals were without spice or seasoning. My husband hadn't even touched the accompaniments to his meal but complained. They did accept it was raw and offer to recook the meal but both our meals were ruined by this point so we settled the bill at a slightly reduced rate and left, neither of us actually having eaten much at all. Not a place I would recommend!
4
Came here for my wifes birthday as we passed by here while walking around earlier and it looked nice from the outside. Shes loves persian type food and she wasn't disappointed.Received excellent service and food when we dined later that night. Overall we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and had three courses plus plenty of drinks. Price was quite reasonable given the amount we ate and drunk with the total being around $90 SGD per person which we thought was very good. Would come back again if we are ever in Singapopre again
5
Went to this place on a whim as we have never tried Persian cuisine before. The staff were excellent, very attentive and helpful with the menu choices and the food was superbly cooked and presented. We enjoyed it so much are going to seek out a Persian restaurant when we return to the UK. There must be some in London at the very least.
5
Wewwere looking for something a bit more reserved than the usual Clark Quay restaurant scene. Situated directly on the river and only a 10 minute relaxing walk from Clark Quay. The staff were very inviting and offered us "happy hour" drinks all evening, so apart from the delightful and informative mediterranean menu and most food was able to gluten free (my wife is a ceoliac).The food was plentiful, tassty and well presented. The staff were delightful and the surroundings were lovely. We had a great night
3
I haven't found my favourite middle Eastern restaurant in Singapore yet - not in Arab street, and not in Shabestan at the Singapore River, either. It's OK if you're really craving for it, but if you can hold your craving till you get to Australia, Europe, or the US - or the real thing in the Middle East! - you'll get much better value for money. Service average and value for money average. The belly dancing is maybe an attractive addition for some..
3
I am all for middle eastern food and always seek out new places in Singapore (how often can you eat at Urban Bites or assorted Turkish restaurants?). So I was looking forward to trying out Shabestan, which had been recommended by many friends as an authentic Iranian restaurant. The waited recommended a bottle of white wine at $80 before we ordered the food. The food WAS excellent though a bit pricey. But the experience was really spoiled when we received the bill and saw the wine bottle was actually over $160! You have been warned!
4
Very good restaurant with plenty of typical Iranian dishes.
The staff is very welcoming and cheerful. The prices are reasonable seen the quality of the service and food.
5
The best in any way.üëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèº
I highly recommend this restaurant to every one.
Respect your body.
Quality of the food
Customer service
Taste of all the foods
Its just beautiful.
You won't never regret it.
Just amazing.
Loved it.
5
This is my first time trying Persian food and I must say the food is awesome! Starting from the appetizer, the yorgurt drink and the meat platter are done very well. Must go.
3
Food was awesome but the service wasn't up to exception. Maybe cause we were a big group. Still food was good specially the appetizers.
5
This restaurant is a nice stroll away from the crowd at Clarke Quay, and very close to my hotel near Robertson Quay. We had hummus, spinach and bread for starter. The tastes are just awesome! Fresh and nicely cooked. The spinach is something not to be missed. It is just so different from anything we had tried before. Highly recommended. We then ordered some home-made cheese to go with. Smashed on the spot. Another must-have for next time. We had a platter of meat as my friend's a big meat eater. I wonder how they make the lamb, beef and so tender, we finished the the whole plate and had to walk a long way for digestion. This is a must-visit place every time I visit Singapore
2
There were winners and losers at this Persian restaurant. My partner had a very good halim baddemjan starter and an excellent javaher polo chicken stew. I chose hummus to start. It was so stiff I could have stood my knife up in it. Had it been in the fridge too long? Or was their version of this classic dish different from and inferior to all other hummus's that I had eaten? But I noticed none of the other 4 people round the table chose to try some. Then I had char grilled lamb. It looked great in the menu photos. But in reality it was thinly sliced pieces of lamb, each one grey and tough with not a scintilla of juice and absolutely no char grill flavour. Very poor. And expensive
5
Our very engaging waiter helped us to select from the menu and also helped us to avoid over-ordering. He explained how each dish that we asked about was made and seemed genuinely happy that we enjoyed our meal. The "belly dancer" was good entertainment with some enviable hip action going on. There is both indoor seating for inclement weather and riverside seating. We asked an Iranian friend where he thinks one can find the best Persian food in Singapore and Shabestan is his top pick: "just like at home".
5
I'm not a food adventurer, we've visited due to a company event.I am not a lover of spice, so their appetizer platter doesn't appeal to me, the flatbread is nice though, especially when they serve warm.Their meat platter is definitely a go, especially with their homemade chilli.We also ordered the grilled lamb and it's simply delicious!The price is slightly steep though.
5
We ate here on New Years Eve after organising a booking over email, as we are currently travelling.Every part of the experience, from the email communication, through the meal, including dessert and onto service and payment was perfect. We ordered two types of Mojitos, the Chefs recommendation starters, the Gulf salad, grilled mixed platter for 2, and some Baclava and coffee to finish. All of the food was simply amazing - great tasting, served quickly and generous portions. The service could not have been better. The staff were friendly, attentive and very energetic, and even though it was New Years Eve and a little busy, the service could not be faulted. This is the second time we have been to Singapore, and the second time we have eaten at Shabestan, and both times it has been perfect. A great location and a fun vibe. Could not recommend this place more.
5
I really enjoyed the food at Shabestan. We visited with friends for dinner and ordered their BBQ platter with few different appetizers. The best for me was home made cheese - just perfect! BBQ and kebabs was done on real charcoal grill - actually we can see the process if you sit inside. Bread was also great - freshly baked. The waiters were running to bring bread for us because all of us linked it the most. Varieties of beers was a good finish for our dinner. Especially the Belgian crafts. Thanks!
5
I had my birthday in shabestan restaurant during our trip to Singapore, we had a memorable night and really enjoyed food & arabian dance.
Especially thanks to mr Mohammad for complimentary champagne !
Try shishlik kabab, that was great.
5
Been several times and I'm now convinced that I could order anything from the menu and it would be delicious.
5
Excellent food, and wonderful service!
perfectly coocked grilled lamb, fragrant spices but not overwhelming, fresh vegetables! i would definitively recommend this place to everyone traveling to singapore!
5
We ordered hummus which wasn't actually that good .. but for main courses we had the sultani and the lamb ribs and it was very good .. we recommend it
2
I am familiar with middle eastern food and this was really not good. It is not that you can't eat it but it is tasteless. At the beginning you get some bread and a small plate with 3 olives, a couple of slices of tomato's, some dead mint and a little bit of spring onions. It really didn't look nice. I had lamb bamieh. The ladyfinger was just dead. So overcooked. The rice was tasteless. My husband took the chicken and rice. He only ate the chicken. We also had the dolma. The restaurant is in a nice area. Many restaurants, caf√É¬©s and the water.The waiters were ok.
4
We loved the food here.. Was recommended by a friend.Only disappointment was the dessert. Expected the baklava to be amazing but it was dry stale and solid.. Not the flaky and light ones which melt in the mouth. The alcohol was really expensive so we decided to stick to sparkling water!Yet, a must go.
5
I have been here once and tried mixed kebab, Persian tea and a very special Persian dessert called Faloodeh.The staff are very friendly, the food has the best quality, very delicious rice and juicy kebab. The Faloodeh is made of real saffron.It's highly recommended to whoever wants to try the best kebab ever
4
It was really good food We had the egg plant appetizer which was good, hummus was not great, but the sultani for the main course was excellent The service was superb and the location is right in the riverPrice was very expensive for the food served , hence the four starsGive it a try
4
Has been long time that I know this place and every time is a confirm of the excellent food quality.Well presented and well cooked, is always a pleasure have a dinner in Shabestan.In addition, she Belly Dancing show, is something that gives to this place an additional point for who wants to enjoy the Persian Atmosphere
3
The thought of exotic meals motivated this choice. The staff took us to our table and left us with menus and we waited. After a fairly long delay we were asked what we wanted to drink. The bottles of wine were expensive for what they were so we opted for wine by the glass....average wine. We asked for water and had to remind them twice before it was served. There is a mixed starter platter which looked tempting. I asked if one of the meat starters could be swapped with a vegetable option. They would not do that. Mains were good but too much on the plate. Interesting dishes but service needed to improve some.

Bowled over by the service and the quality of the food. The Persian food is a must try. Perfect combination of flavors. Highly recommended.
5
Totally awesome food and fantastic hospitality! Best part is the staff makes a special effort to explain how each dish is prepared!
Ying and team , thank you for one of my most memorable dining experiences! You do a fabulous job!

Fabulous restaurant, I've never tried Persian before but I loved the flavours & loved the atmosphere. I would definitely recommend it
5
There are few Persian restaurants in Singapore. But, this one is definitely the best. The ambience is not noisy and the food is great.
5
Very interesting decor and particularly the lamps. The food is fabulous. Portions are large. In particular recommend the combination platter which gives you a chance to taste a variety of kebabs and food stuff. Excellent restaurant.

The vegetarian tasting plate was really delicious, mains good although a little plain, staff were warm, friendly and attentive and the ambiance was serene. Would recommend.

I visited this place many times when I was living in Singapore. We would frequently visit for weekend lunch and just sit and enjoy the river. I rate this place outstanding for the quality of food: the ingredients seem to be top grade, and cooked just right. Our favourites were the mixed starter (5 small dishes together with bread), the salad shirazi and the chicken kebab. The bread which is freshly baked to order is just perfect. I will say that the service could be better - it just seemed rather random and amateurish at times - and I'm not convinced by the Saturday evening belly dancing. Nevertheless, Shabestan easily deserves 5 stars for its outstanding cooking

Having moved to Singapore from Dubai in 2008, I have been looking for a decent Middle Eastern restaurant...for the last 7 years! And then...I found Shabestan!!! They literally serve the best grilled kebabs, in the entire city!!! Literally, after trying the Middle Eastern food at Arab Street, I lost all faith in humanity, it was sooo atrocious! Shabestan is this shining beacon of hope for Middle Eastern restaurants in Singapore....yes, good ones do exists!!! Will find every excuse in to come back here!!! Loved the Chicken and Beef Masti!!! and the chili sauce they serve on the side! Thank you Shabestan!!! I love you guys!!! keep it up!!
5
Helpful and courteous staff, and quick service, Delightful riverside setting, relaxed atmosphere and one of the best tasting meals ever.(I chose the duck with a side salad). The chef clearly understands flavour balance. My only problem was that I didnt manage to get back for a second meal here during my week

If you love Persian food - this is the best place to be in Singapore.Meticulously prepared cuisine with the finest ingredients, complimented with it's beautiful ambience of sitting by the riverside while being entertained every Friday and Saturday evenings with performances by a belly dancer.They have the old time favourite, Meze Platter and good selection of grilled meat and kebabs - but best of all, we love their Caspian Style Braised Duck, it can't get any better than this!They have a very good wine selection to accompany their scrumptious dishes and can even impress the best of wine connoiseurs out there - which my husband is one.Their desserts include the classic Baghlava. I personally like the Persian Saffron Ice Cream - homemade with pistachio and saffron. Yum!Service is good and efficient with a smile. Although, sometimes when it's busy, the service can be a bit challenged and rushed - however, this is true of most places

Located in Robertson Quay this restaurant serves beautiful food. We had lamb which was delicious, service was excellent and friendly. Value for money was very good, location beside the river gave a relaxing dining atmosphere
5
This restaurant has everything, tasty food, friendly staff, great service and fantastic river view settings at reasonable prices, highly recommend

We ate here for my fiance's birthday on a Sunday night and after the first bite of the entree I said I we had to return for my birthday. The food is unbelievably tasty with great flavours that are not too over powering. We love our chilli sauces, so to hear the Chef has a home made one was a treat in itself. However, despite the chilli sauce being "spot on" to what we wanted we found that the meat dishes were so tasty that we enjoyed it more without the chilli sauce.I wish I had the menu in front of me to describe what we had, though I'm confident whatever you order, you won't be disappointed. I was tempted to title this review as "If the chef leaves the country, I'm following him"

Robertson quay is always a great experience, and some years ago we had liked the restaurant formerly in the same location, so we decided to try Shabestan. By inspection, we were concerned that it was similar to the touristy but low quality restaurants in the Bugis area, but we were entirely wrong and delightfully surprised to find an excellent persian restaurant -- we had the eggplant dip, fresh cheese, and a meat platter to share followed by dessert. Everything was well spiced, fresh and very tasty. We ate on a Friday, so I'm not sure if it's nightly or only on weekends, but there were also belly-dancing performances a few times, which gave a fun and lively atmosphere, as the performers bring (willing) people from the audience to dance along. The music makes it a little loud if you were looking for quiet romance, but it was perfect for us
5
Located alone the river near clarke quay this restaurant is a little gem.it got a nice interior and friendly staff. you can either sit inside or outside.the food is excellent whether you order kebab or other types of grilled meat.dont like meat? well no problem, it also got a variety of vegetar dishes all well made.Just take note that portions are big so think twice before ordering starters.
4
When we came across Shabestan we were after drinks mainly. Shabestan is located on the river in Robertson Quay and was advertising 'Happy Hour" drinks so we stopped in for a beer and a Pina Colada.I haven't eaten a lot of Persian food but when I have I have loved it so it wasn't long until I had to order something. We ordered an Appetiser Platter. It was delicious and complimented our drinks and the ambiance to perfection. Five delicious elements including the best hummus we have ever had, a lamb meatball, some spiced spinach, braised eggplant and a bean puree with flat bread.Service was great. On that note whilst we were there a man walking a dog came in and wanted to sit with some friends that were there at the next table. We were outside so I wasn't bothered but the waitress made a point of asking if we minded. She then came back with a bowl of water for the dog. Fantastic touch.On the strength of that appetiser platter we will be coming back here for a full meal definitely
4
I really like the food here, the home made cheese with nann is really yummy, Their bbq meat is really good but i think the price is a bit on the high side, it can be a meal of at least 50 per pax. We ordered the platter for 3 person and the platter is really good. Add on a lamb shank and the meat just tear off from the bone and my friend is shocked when i told them that is lamb as it doesnt smell or taste like lamb at all
5
Amazing food and service. Authentic Persian food for sure. I have been to iran before and the food you taste here is what you will taste in Iran. Love the atmosphere of this restaurant as it is along the Singapore river. Food to try: ghormeh sabzi / Ash / Jujeh kebab. Drinks: Persian Tea or Dough ( yogurt drink) Those are my favourite. Every Friday and Saturday 8-930pm you will enjoy a belly dancing live performance. Closest MRT is clarke quay or take a taxi to Robertson Quay. Thumbs up to chef Mohammad and chef Ying

Last night was the 3rd visit for us in 2 months and again it didn't disappoint.This has got to be one of the best value restaurants in terms of the "critical trio": cuisine, location/ ambience and service - especially compared with the overrated, overpriced and highly disappointing options higher up on Boat Quay!Based along the riverside in Robertson Quay, this lovely restaurant delighted us with its memorable home made cheese starter (pine nuts included) and falafel with tahini which kickstarted a great evening alongside a bottle of Prosecco at a very reasonable price by Singapore and riverside standards.Last time, my partner had a Persian lamb stew that he raved about for most of the evening but this time we ordered a Persian platter to share - variety of prawn, chicken and lamb or beef (choice given) kebabs served with basmati rice and if you like,the chef's own home made spicy hot chili relish! It didn't disappoint! The meat was all very succulent and well spiced with traditional flavourings which included sumac. It was more than enough for 2 of us and we were glad to have shared so that we could sample more than one meat. The tabbouleh salad ordered as a side dish also was presented with no shortcuts although for next time, I may venture with the pomegranate and walnut salad variety just for a change. The service too was excellent and staff are motivated and happy to advise on the extensive menu items. The only less positive comment I'd have to make is re the price of the desserts eg a small piece of baklava costs 5$. As much as I do very much like it, that price is exorbitant especially for the portion size on offer. But all in all, if you feel like a casual or even romantic dining experience on the water in what could be in a foreign land, this would be a very satisfying choice

We wandered to this restaurant after already sharing a cheese and antipasto platter at a nearby wine bar so were not looking for a full meal or banquet. Banquet menu did look delicious but we settled on a main course and salad to share with a couple of glasses of wine. Stunning venue on the river, comfortable seating (although the chairs were seriously heavy to move back and forth!), friendly service and no attempt to try to get us to order more than we wished. Prices not too bad for SIngapore, huge serves and absolutely perfect for our meal. Would definitely return to this restaurant to try other dishes
5
This is simply the best dining experience to be had in Singapore. Beautiful new flavours, lovely service, a Menu to suit all diners and location easily accessible.
If your in Singapore for 1 night or more you must try Shabestan.
5
Great casual restaurant. Very attentive service that's overlooked by the owner/manager. Portions aren't big.
5
Had the Persian Bread as a starter & Mix Kubideh Kebab as the main course. Both were savory and flavorsome. Probably the best Persian food I've tasted so far! Will definitely be back again to indulge in the goodness this restaurant provides.
4
I went to shabestan twice and I love it... The first time I ordered a set lunch and a minced lamb, all nice (only the baklava was a bit dry). The second time I got the mixed starters plate and the lamb filet marinated in saffron sauce. The starters were all good, though the flavors are quite strong (so not easy to match one with each other) next time I'd rather go for one starter only (the hummus and the tahini eggplant are my favorite). The main course was simply amazing the meat was very nicely cooked, soft and juicy (I went for medium doness) the only bad point is maybe the rice and the inplate sides, but I m not a fan of rice. My friend got the lamb leg in some sauce I don't remember, it was also amazing, the meat was great and the sauce even better, it's a incredible dish.This time the baklava was maybe fresher and was really good. I gave four out of five only for the service which could be better managed (they don't change the cutlery, bring the food as it's ready instead of waiting for the starter to be finished and so on...) considering also I went on a week day.I tried some other persian restaurant around the city center and this is the best for sure.highly recommen

Visited the place for dinner on a Saturday night.Was a rainy day so was glad that we were assigned to an indoor table. Would be nice to be sitting along the riverbank if the weather had been less wet. The decoration inside the restaurant was classy. Great service by the waiter. Can't recall his name but he shared recommendations patiently with us. The crowd included families and friends, mostly the middle aged. There was a belly dancer dancing at around 8pm and it caught the attention of many passers-by. Food was good. My first time having Persian so might not be the best person to do the comparison. However, my friend who has been to arab mentioned that the food at Shabestan is really quite commendable. I like the service overall and food was good!
4
Very authentic middle eastern food with a wide variety. Service is great and manager / owner very attentive. Wine selection could be improved. So could the flexibility in the service. We were in a group of 10 and the private room was empty. They would insist on a minimum spend when we were likely to meet that, but more to the point the room was empty with no reservations
4
a causal walk down the Quay on a Sunday afternoon, looking for a light lunch and saw the Set menu, and it was a smashing Decision. The soup was very nice, the Lamb and Rice were outstanding, even the Ice cream was good.Any day will go back for a Meal. Oh and the price was reasonably, never get a three course in the UK for under ¬£15.00
5
We went for dinner and ordered the combo platter for 4 as well as the lamb chops. The food was fantastic and the meat melted in my mouth. Food portions are just right and everything was prepared to perfection and served hot. It was the one of the best dining experiences I have had in recent times
4
I had a chance to visit one evening this good restaurant recently due to business trip and ‚Ä¶ I was really nicely surprised about the atmosphere at all there and the good Persian food!We made initially joke about ‚ÄúKebabs‚Äù, but ‚Ä¶ really very tasty and well prepared! The rest food was well prepared and very tasty too‚Ä¶ - no any remarks :) ‚Ä¶.Very polite and friendly staff ‚Ä¶. Recommended place ‚Ä¶
5
My colleague and I were there for a business discussion and the ambience, atmosphere and service was amazing. We ordered the mixed kubideh kebab served with the special rice and sides. Simply amazing. We were also served a generous portion of the persian bread as an appetiser and it opened up our palates for the kubideh kebab. Will definitely be back for more!
5
Always consistently good! This is the only place to go for Iranian food here in Singapore. Chef Mohammed is friendly too.
4
A very nice Persian restaurant on the Singapore river. Good food and service. Definately worth a visit.

One of the best meals I have ever had in a restaurant! The chef gave us his suggestions and made up a custom made dish for us which was delicious. The amazingly well cooked meat is some of the best I've ever had! The wine list is wonderful and the service was great! I could not recommend this place more, it is honestly one of the best nights out in Singapore
1
Went there Feb 2015.Looked nice from outside.Service good -very pleasant waiter.Food was diabolical.We had two main meals.My meal was stone cold.Waiter agreed and took meal away for reheating.My wifes meal tasted like dish water-it was awful.The manager and waiter accepted the problem and gave a 20 percent discount.Even then the basic main course and one drink each cost the equivelant of ¬£63
5
Yesterday I was with my Company special guest with a group of 10 strolling down at Robertson quay and happen to saw this Persian restaurant.Was attracted with their menu featuring some Persian meat cuisine and decide to give them a try .Was serve by the owner ying and led to a table with a nice view over looking the river.Decided on 2 bottle of Anna cava blanc de blanc from Spain to start with . And order a 2 signature dish Shabestan platter with some other side dish .The cava was awesome and I will say that it better then most of the commercial champagne that I have ever try . ( am surprised) The Shabestan platter consist of a generous potion of succulent juicy moist lamb , beef , 4 generous jumbo giant prawns , chicken .I should say the food is excellent and definitely a place to entertain value guest of your company .Thumbs up to the owner of Shabestan . You be seeing me real soon
5
We went there for dinner not only with friends but also with families. The place is nice especially for real outdoor dining and love the atmosphere there. The food are good & quite delicious. Our friends, normally, asked chef recommendation/s to try different dishes whenever we are and we were quite satisfied with their recommendation. It was superb..! My kids and friends like the belly dancing while we were having dinner. It is quite entertaining as well
5
I have been here many times and now is my regular place to hand out with friends and particularly for my business meetings.They really make you feel special by the way they treat you. The food and selection of choices are awesome , it's something unique that u can't find it in common restaurants nowadays . I was so keen to find out how they do it and the friendly chef showed me the food preparation as the kitchen has a transparent glass.I personally like to try different food of them but haven't had a chance to try out the whole menu, it's my 2015 resolution ;) The location is next to river and the view makes you feel relaxed . I highly recommend this place if you fancy trying something memorable 
1
We went for dinner at Robertson quay shabestan. The service was slow and a hair strand was present in one of the dish which was shocking. On complaining about this to the waiter the response was not at all satisfactory. It was really bad experience. After spending so much money on the dinner how can you expect such negligence from the staff. None of the chef were wearing the head cap. Will never visit there again. Feeling awful
5
Our family had our Christmas dinner there as I want to bring my family to eat something not ordinary and this turned out to be extraordinary! The special persian bread with olive, cheese and fresh veggies at the beginning is a not typical appetizer. The grill platter is the main dish we order for 4 people to share. The lamb is so tender with a mild tasting, which is just rigjt for us. The prawns, chicken, fish and mutton, although all grilled, but each have its great flavor. The last fried rice is also exotic to us too. The rice is fried with pomegranates and Saffron (a spice is as expensive as gold) and gives a gold color and unique fragrance. You can tell they have a great chef who is sincere about making top quality food. It is not cheap, but definitely worth the money. They also have the belly dance on weekends, which I heard is quite good too. It is a pity that the day we went there isn't any. I will definitely recommend my friends to try this restaurant if they are looking for some unqiue dinning experience.
5
Definitely an amazing place worth a visit. Their platter is one of the best I have ever tried. We went to the restaurant in a group, among us are some meat lovers and one vegetarian. The platter was huge, and our meat lovers were so impressed with the juicy lamb, beef, and chicken. The meats were just amazingly tender and delicious. I personally love the sophisticated taste of Persian rice. It was different from other rice I tried before, and blended so well with the meaty treats. With some red wine, nice.The vegetarian in our group chose the stew and absolutely loved it. The crowd looks beautiful too. I tried other Persian restaurants before, absolutely the best one in town
2
Service was ok. The mixed grill plate hardly resembles the photos in the menu and was served cold. Still the taste was there. The safran ice cream and faloodeh was excellent. Over priced for what is on the offer.
4
3rd visit to this restaurant. Always good service. Food provides nice change from other Asian options in relaxed surrounds by the river. Meals are of a good portion size and filling. Price is average for Robertson quay area ($85) for 1.
4
Food very good, service good. enjoyed the night. If you sit outside you can watch the boats sail up and down the river.
5
I tried a couple of Persian restaurants in Singapore and Shabestan was the best hands down.Great food, good atmosphere and well trained staff.Food presentation was awesome and food quality, in my opinion, competes with high-end restaurants in Iran.Good place if you want to try some Persian food
3
I had the zereshk polo and the lamb kabob. They were good enough, I did have better though. The only down side is that this place is overly overly expensive considering the food.The service was slow a bit, maybe because they were busy a bit and the atmosphere is not bad. I'm sure there are other better options for persian food in singapore
4
Definitely worth a visit. Feels very authentic and the food was great. I would suggest sharing dishes though,as the portions are huge. The wine selection by the bottle was ok, but the selection by the glass was poor. Service was attentive and location by the river was very pretty and away from the noise of the local bars. Very easy to relax and eat too much food!!
4
Visited this restaurant on a whim because the wife and I fancied middle Eastern food. It was a bit quiet for a Friday night, but lack of atmosphere aside, this is an excellent restaurant that deserves to be bringing in more diners. All the dishes we had were excellent, particularly the Halim Bademjan (pureed eggplant with lamb) and the mixed chicken and lamb kebabs. Service was top notch, and although belly-dancing in restaurants is the kind of thing that would usually annoy me in a restaurant, here it was unobtrusive. Other reviewers have claimed Shabestan is over-priced, I think the prices are OK, especially given the discounts offered on certain credit cards. Will definitely return
4
We went with my husband who is Iranian, to try this new Persian restaurant at Roberston Quay.The service wad really good and the waiter came by a couple of times to check if everything was ok.We ordered the tradotional Kubide, rice and another side.The food was really similar to the one i had in Iran. My husband agreed. As it was a friday night it was busy but still the ambience was just nice. We will sure be back
4
Until recently, Shiraz at Clarke Quay was my go to place for Persian food, but my most recent visit was a disappointment, the quality of food had deteriorated significantly and its not cheap. Shabestan pricing looks exactly the same, probably Shabestan has more dishes to offer. They too served the complimentary bread with cottage cheese and olives and I did spot a few of Shiraz's waiters here. Not sure if the chef of Shiraz moved out and started working at Shabestan. The service was good, we were promptly seated. The staff was polite and always near by in case you need anything, but not too intrusive. I ordered my usual Soltani Kabab and the meat was very succulent and juicy. The rice were a bit dry for my liking but nothing that spoilt the taste of the dish, probably a bit more butter and they'll flow like they should. The baklava wasn't too sweet and my dad who's lived in Iran for 10 years said that it didn't taste like the original, so defer to him. The persian tea was a big cup but pricey. This place serves good Persian food (only tried 1 dish, but that's the toughest to make, so made the cut). But its pricey, even the wines by glass were towards the upper end of the range I've paid in SG. The view is good (better than Shiraz) however, I'm not a big fan of the Asian belly dancers & loud music. Do reserve ahead as the restaurant was 90% full on a Saturday night, ask for indoors if you don't like the muggy SG weather as there aren't many fans around. Will be visiting this place often going forward for my usual dose of Persian food
5
We decided to try this place as we looking for a dinner place in Robertson Quay.The salad was okayish, the chicken kebab was yummy yummy, and so was the prawn biryani!It was authentic, non greasy and high quality. They had a live Belly dancer performing in there giving a cheery ambience to the place.Expensive place (every dish is about 40 SGD) but well worth it 
4
Food is awesome! Bbq at its best. Prices is slightly on the high, drinks was average. Overall for me 9/10 for food. 5/10 for beverage.
4
I've walked past this place many times but always on the way to somewhere else. I'm glad to say that I gave it a try and the standard of food was well above expectations. The appetiser platter, lamb dishes and salads were all winners and the only issue I had was that, even by Singapore standards, the booze is very pricey and you may want to load up somewhere else beforehand unless you really want to splash out. The staff try very hard to please and usually succeed. Would definitely return
5
Walking by and looking at menu when the waiter showed us the menu, he was abosoultely fantastic and explained the menu really well, which was Devine. We also enjoyed two cocktails with our meal. Pricing was fair and then enjoyed a stroll around the river afterwards.
5
Had the joy of feasting at Shabestan. The restaurant is beautifully located on the bank of the Sungapore river on Robertson Quay. Great ambiance, diligent service and exquisite food. Be warned the food ain't cheap...expect to pay approximate 70+ per person (starter and main). Personally it's pure value for money. I have tried many Persian restaurants in Asia and this was by far the finest. The meat is so soft, you can literally tare it off with a fork. The lamb dishes on offer is a must have. I am definitely a return customer
5
We saw this restaurant from the riverside while walking and it caught my eye. Has a few tables right on the riverwalk so you have an excellent view of the river. We went back for dinner and found that the food was excellent. We had a local waiter that really outdid himself with food and drink recommendations. Very hearty food and portions. Make sure you are hungry when you visit
4
We've been now to Shabestan multiple times, usually with overseas visitors to our home. And each time we and our guests have found it wonderful. The food is very flavorful and the menu has a range of choices. I've not had the privilege to know what real authentic Iranian food tastes like, but I'd say this must come pretty close - you can't have that much flavor and deliciousness for it not to belong!! :-) We've typically had their meat dishes, and some poultry, and all have been very well prepared and we remember the flavors for days after! I did notice that their menu also has vegetarian dishes for those not eating meat, its just that I've not had a chance to order them. Their staff is attentive and courteous. One time on a busy Saturday evening, we had a long wait (it was busy), but the manager/owner came over and personally apologized, and chatted with us, and offered complimentary drinks/desserts - we didn't take advantage, but we were touched by his gesture!!. That touch of personal attention really floored us, we keep going back repeatedly, and are never disappointed. The ambience is really nice, its on Robertson Quay, so basically riverside, overlooking the water. The restaurant is one of the bigger ones, so has ample place, both outdoors and in. Their bar is well stocked, and they have good music. Some days they have a belly dancer, skinny as a rake, but well, that's Singapore ;-
5
What a delightful surprise to find such an authentic and excellent Persian Cuisine restaurant in Singapore. The Kabab-e-Barg in particular is out of this world. Service was superb. The location of course is very nice. A bit expensive though ($ 60 person not counting alcohol) but still amazing value for money. I stayed in Singapore for six nights and ended up going to Shabestan three time. Need I say more
2
The Robertson Quay area of the city is not renound for its food. It is more of a drinking location. Shabestan fits into this perfectly. I was not expecting too much, but decided to give the place a try as it is trying to be something a little different, and the menu sounded really good. By different I mean it is serving a different cusine, charging about 25% more than surrounding resturants and not seeming to try to be a bar that serves food.All went well at the start, the waiter was attentive and was able to talk about the menu, how we wanted the food served etc. We were one of the few people there, so the food arrived quickly (good point). We had ordered dips, kebabs and a beef dish. My complements to the food photographer who was able to generate the pictures on the menu. What arrived on our table was a distant miniture dried up relation to the pictures on display. The meal did have some hints of good flavours, but was overall poorly cooked (beef overcooked, chicken and lamb dry) and served with no sauces (glad we had some dips to resolve this) that each plate did not work on its own.Service was also poor. During the hour we were there, with the resturant almost empty, nobody came by our table to ask if we were OK, would like a refill of water, or if they could get us anything else. At the end we provided feedback that the food was OK, but overpriced. The response was that yes, that is because the rent around this area is expensive. I accept that this is a valid point. But it also tells me that the resturant is agreeing that what they are serving is overpriced. Given this, and that there are plenty of better options in terms of food quality, price or service nearby, I don't think that I would recommend eating here
4
Had dinner with my friends on a weekday evening and the place is not packed. Good ambience, however the sitting area outside is a bit hot. The airconditioned sitting area is only open in weekends. the staff is friendly and the service was fast. The food did not disappoint either. Although a bit pricey (we spent around 80 dollars per person) I would definitely go back to this place
3
This was our second trip to this restaurant. We decided to give it a second try as we hadn't been that impressed the first time. The setting is lovely and the service was attentive. However, we felt that it is too pricey for what is only reasonable food. I don't have a great knowledge of Persian food but I did expect more flavour. We ordered a salad entree, which was nothing special and then a lamb stew and grilled chicken and beef together. The grilled dish was tasty but fairly plain and served with plain rice. The lamb stew lacked flavour and had a very watery gravy, but was tender.On the other hand, the complimentary bread and salad was really nice
5
I love middle eastern cuisine and Shabestan's food is very much commendable. The environment makes you feel that you are sitting in the middle of an exotic environment. Great place for family dinner or just to have good food.
5
this is the best Persian food I have tasted in Singapore!!! I would love to go there again to enjoy the belly dancing. Great experience!!!
5
Delicious Persian food.Shabestan have the best Persian food i've ever had.Shabestan have delicious deserts.
4
Enjoyed a platter for two which is composed of - 4shrimps, 6 pcs of chicken, minced lamb, beef, a half-cut tomate and some cabbage. Volume was good enough (complimentary bread, cheese and small amount of vegetable were given beforehand). Chicken was nicely juicy, minced lamb was tasty enough and beef was lovely - however, I should have chosen lamb instead of beef... Lamb is my best favourite..As dessert we had saffran ice cream which was very much impressive - worth a try. I never have such a sweet - only S$8.They don't change menu/price whether day or night, then, it wouldn't seem a very good idea to have lunch here (but we did....) the cost can be high side for lunch. I like to try this restaurant as dinner next time
4
Succulent meats and tasty sides. Really enjoyed the food.Service is friendly, but they do make mistakes with the orders a little too often for my liking. It is a little pricey for a "regular" restaurant, with mains in the $35-45 range. If they dropped the prices a little I feel its popularity would skyrocket
2
They advertise themselves as being on Mohammed Sultan Road but they are not. They are one of the large capacity restaurants on Robertson Quay. Seeing this I should have probably walked away, but having read the various reviews I decided to give it a try, I wish I had kept on walking. Service was slow, inefficient as I was made to feel as a lone business traveller, pretty unwelcome. If you were a couple or a single person, priority was given to larger tables. The wait for main course was 45 mins and the customer expectations were managed appallingly. I ordered probably the most expensive main for one person, 49SGD. The lamb was overcooked and pretty bland, which is a shame for a country where beautiful fresh and fragrant spices from around SE Asia are abundant. I asked for a side of yoghurt dressing and despite repeated reminders, it arrived when I had almost finished my meal, at which point I was told that it was 4SGD extra, which I contested. All in all a pretty poor experience, I won't be returning and recommend you give it a miss. Wine Connection around the corner has better wine for half the price, friendly efficient staff and great food. I don't like leaving bad reviews, but felt my experience justified it.

Supper for 3 adults at 9pm on a Wednesday March evening and we had headed to Robertson Quay with no booking and somewhat stumbled into Shabestan, not expecting a lot, but were very pleasantly surprised. Very warm welcome - get them to show you the dishes on iPAD, a winner when you don't know your way around a Persian menu. Starters of tri-style meatballs and aubergine were excellent, as was soft lamb stew and fragrant rice. Chilled NZ Savignon perfectly reasonable in quality and price (for Singapore). We will be back
5
We love persian food and we love robertson area for its lively nights especially on saturdays. Shabestan has a great decore and ambience. The menu has all the best persian food which we know. kebabs and naans are the best to try a persian meal. We ordered the bakhtiary kebab and lambkubide as well as lamb stew where all were great. The great thing is the free appetizer with cheese olive and tomato with persian bread. We also ordered halim bademjan which is a dish made mainly by eggplants which was really nice and tasty.The good thing about saturday nights is the belly dancing and we enjoyed it. the price wise is rather expensive but it makes sense to us given the high quality food and the best lication it has to offer.

I have to say, that this restaurant was absolutely awesome. Good location near Robertson Quay and lovely views right by the river. Service was fast, friendly and our waiter made us feel like we've been there dozens of time before. Great ambience and belly dancers fit to the feeling(usually they are like clich√É¬© like decoration). Champagne was reasonably priced in Singapore standards, but the best thing was food. We share different starters and main courses and everything was over the top. Fresh, top quality, tast

We celebrated Christmas Eve here with my Sister. Service and friendliness were outstanding. Mohammad the Owner makes you feel very welcome, its like seeing a good friend. Food was very yummy and we even got a free dessert to try. It`s amazing clean, even the Toilets, and the setting near the River is also a big Plus. They have a belly dancer which is enjoyable to watch. If we are back in Singapore we will definitely go back there. We got so spoilt. Thanks Mohammad we had a lovely time
