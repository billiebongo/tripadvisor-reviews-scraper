We had a great breakfast but the Price was quite expansive. Whatever, we can recommend it. Full stomache :)

Came here with friends for brunch.. they have good coffee and brunch menu.. tried their Lavender croissant which taste very yummy.. coffee is good too.
3
Food is good but service is bad. Only one cashier to manage the queue. Very little staff too. Iced coffee had too much cream:/ Very instagrammable and good food though. Very few seats too so be sure to go at a non busy time!

This place is killing it. Great coffee, an incredible brunch menu and great atmosphere. This will absolutely be my future go to spot for brunch in Geylang.
Give it a try, you won’t be disappointed.

Lovely staff, great coffee. Limited food menu. Love their latte and cold brews. Its really worth a visit.

Randomly search online one weekend for a new cafe to try and saw good reviews about this place so decided to try it out. It was easy to find and there was ample parking space. When we get there, it was crowded and we were told it is free seating. We managed to get a seat within 5-10mins while browsing the menu. There are not alot of choices for brunch so we went for the advice of the top two likes - bacon and slow cooked eggs over toast & salmon and poached eggs with melted cheese. They usually advise to add toast for your salmon and poached eggs as there is no toast for that so it will taste better. To me i felt that the toast was kind of overkill as the dish was good as it is unless of course you would like to have additional carb load. Both were delicious and coffee was nice. I like the way the cafe is decorated and location so i would definitely come back very often.

“Brains and Brawn” cafe as I would call it is a nice little cafe. For those who do not drive, it may seem a little out of the way. It’s situated next to a rock climbing gym at 100 Guillemard Road which isn’t immediately obvious from the main road. The cafe has basic furnishings, nothing fancy. In fact, I found the chairs rather uncomfortable after a few minutes. Despite this, I could tell that it’s a popular cafe as I went on a Sunday after lunch and the place was still packed full of people. Or perhaps these are the people who like me, are enjoying a lazy Sunday. Food wise, I had the Molten Eggs with smoked salmon which was pretty good. The eggs were cooked just right and the salmon is a perfect complement. I know the portions were a little small so I ordered extra toast. The coffee was pretty decent too. The bill came to around $25 which is a bit on the pricier side. This place is a little out of the way for me but tried it as LGF recommended. Would probably try other places the next time.Service was prompt and waiters friendly and helpful.

Awesome coffee, although, i think it is slightly pricey. I am a little disappointed as I tried to visit it the last 2 times and it was closed. I think they changed the operating hours and had private events. So be sure to check their social media before dropping by

Located less than 10 mins from the heart of the central business district and at the edge of the famed red light district (Geylang).It is housed in the building that used to House Singapore Badminton Hall. The hall has been turned into an indoor wall gym - hence this cafe can be quite crowded during weekend breakfast and lunch peak hours.You must try the Earl Grey Slice + yoghurt and honey (pictured) - it’s simply amazing especially when paired with a cup of black coffee

We went today for breakfast and really liked the atmosphere. The coffee was excellent, and the food was good.The only downer was the service. The chefs' quirks seem to be more important than customer satisfaction. My girlfriend wanted to order a specific dish without melted cheese on top as she is lactose intolerant. This was accepted initially by the staff, however they came to our table a few minutes later telling us that "this is not the way the chef wants to present the dish", and therefore getting this dish without cheese on top was not possible.So ridiculous that even the other clients next to us were laughing...

Nicely hosted, quickly served and delicious food ! Definitely recommend this place for a great grilled bacon & egg toast or a salmon and poached eggs salad !
5
As a family with 2 kids, we had a brakfast with 2 different toasts and coffee, which was a unique experience. Very nice staff.
4
I enjoyed my first visit to the place. Great food and coffee, nice ambience. Definitely worth a visit!
5
great food and great coffee, enjoyed a late breakfast here and it was excellent, a busy place which tends to say that it will be good.
3
We enjoyed our visit here. A bit pricy for Singapore. But still worth it when you want something more than the hawker-stall-type.
4
Found this cafe to be a tad too expensive for where it is located and the size of the food presented. Don't get me wrong, the food is good and the house blend coffee is very nice (very strong!!!) but $5 for a small latte is really quite too much. The cafe itself is modern and looks nice. I do have to say the little seats are uncomfortable. But the service was good and friendly and we had a good brunch all the same. Still give them 4 stars because they seem to really try so hard to be trendy and have freshly made food.
2
Food is not bad but is not cheap either. Coffee is average, not much to say about it. On a weekday morning, it might be a good place to chill; however, it gets crazy on weekends. I was ever told by a cashier that I would need to wait for my food for 30 mins after waiting 20 mins for my table. The worst thing is that my husband left after he heard that while me and my friends stay. When the cashier told us about the wait, she had a rather rude attitude and warned me that I'd better don't leave after I placed the order despite of the long waiting time what kind of attitude is that? Guess she is either the boss or she hates her boss so much a that she would like to chase her customers away!! Not sure if I will go back anymore after this incident
5
Great Aussie style coffee. I didn't realise exactly how close this place was to me, and finally checked it out. Only had coffee here so far, which has not disappointed. Will try the food soon, which we hope pleases as much as the coffee. It seems these guys have taken on much of the feedback provided here as we have not experienced any of the gripes other reviews have mentioned and each visit has been quite pleasant. Keep it up guys

Today, we went our favourite coffee bar in the Katong neighbourhood. Small little place. Coffee is truly great. Downside is that there is no tap water. You can only order relatively expensive bottles of water. If I pay 6,5 sgd for a coffee, I would expect to get some free tap water. Other customers were complaining too.
2
This is the only 'western' cafe in an area known for local cuisine but unfortunately they don't offer service that is worth coming back for.The staff is inattentive and seems not to mind the customers comfort. I was barely acknowledged as I entered, was told I had to wait 20 min for my take away coffee when there was no queue, wasn't allowed to wait for my coffee standing (I was literally told 5 times to take a seat) and was denied water unless I paid $5++ for a small bottle.The place looks nice and the coffee is OK, so it's a shame that their business model makes me walk an additional 10 minutes to another caf
5
Best coffee. Best sandwiches.
Gwen and Xavier make the extra effort to make this place warm n personal. Never a bad experience and always comforting to be here.
Love the smell of coffee when you hang out here.
5
Location probably isn't the best, but the venue inside is cozy, staff is quick on their feet, good coffee. Drank the bottled White coffee.

Goods food and coffee but price above the avg. Place is small but quality is good. You should try it out

Brawn & Brains Café, SingaporeWe’d stayed overnight – just the one night – in and out of Changi Airport en route out-of-the-country; it was Sunday morning and we’d been exploring the area of high rise apartments alongside and behind Guillemard Road through to the Food Centre & Shopping Mall on Old Airport Road. Someone had said that it was a good place to get breakfast.Many people were out and about crossing the pristine green lawns that surrounded the tower blocks; we found a playground (which included adult exercise equipment) in which not quite three-year Esmé could enjoy herself for 10-15 minutes. What we didn’t find was a coffee-shop. We’d passed the Brawn & Brains Café on Guillemard Road on the way out, but it was closed (and looked, honestly, like it had been closed for ever). It was Sunday morning.Coffee and brioche beckoned; but we still hadn’t found that bar. Returning back the way we’d come – surprise, surprise, the B&B was open. Inside we found a bar not unlike that which you’d find back home; but then, that is probably what that the owners had intended. New country and new cuisines – sure, but it’s also great to enjoy what you like; and morning coffee & brioche complies with that early-mid-morning routine, and more particularly when it comes with time to sit and talk for a spell.Club-like inside with a long narrow room with metal tables and stools lined down the middle with the bar/reception to one side and floor to ceiling window on the other that fronted on to Guillemard Road – outside green foliage, bright white apartment buildings reflecting the sun and light traffic. Everything inside black. Not an unattractive setting.We were one of the first few customers – but others trickled in behind us; people knew each other – clearly a regular clientele. Twenty minutes later as we left there were more than 20 people inside. We ordered coffee and brioche … well, croissants really, and they came with almond toppings. A choice of different toppings was available.It was, cliché again, coffee just like you’d buy in your local bar (before taking the metro that morning) or once you’d arrived in the CDB, and before heading for the office. It was an Australian model bar. Prices reflected this too, with cost per unit around SIN$5. We paid SIN$31 for three coffees & four fancy croissants.Hot coffee in china (or glass or take-out) and with a pretty motif decoration in the froth and tasty fresh warm croissants – just what we’d been looking for; we couldn’t face another plate of noodles with tea on the side for breakfast, although that’s just what Esmé wanted (and what we bought in Geylang Road before returning to the hotel, with chicken too).Whatever, the B&B comes highly recommended as a coffee/brioche repository that will remind you of what you’ve left at home when you set out to explore SE Asia.Peter Steele31 March 2017PS. I still don’t know the derivative/meaning of the name of this place? Should have asked someone

Decide to venture a little further from home today and went to Brawns and Brains cafe. Place was not easy to find and the building housing it is a tad rundown and there is no obvious signage to the cafe. Arrived at 2.30pm on a Friday and was surprised that the place was packed. The seating provided were hard metal stools (not chairs, i.e. no backrest or arm rest) and they kinda cramped 4 people to 1 side of a table which doesn't give you any privacy for conversation as you are practically elbow to elbow with the person sitting next to you. Menu was limited (only 6 brunch & sandwich selections and one was already sold out). Prices were reasonable (range from around $13.50 to $16.50). We ordered the smoked salmon brioche sandwich and the eggs with everything (salmon, salad, avocado). Both dishes taste good except that they served the smoked salmon sandwich with potato chips (not fries) that can be found in any supermarket. We ordered latte which I would rate as above average (but I am not a coffee drinker so my expectations of coffee could be low). However, it is quite expensive as it was served in a small cup (120ml?) and costs $5. We asked for water but was told that we have to pay for bottled water as they don't provide tap water. This is a big NO NO to me as Singapore provides drinkable tap water so places which charges for water gets a thumbs down from me. They also only accept cash and payment by NETS. So if you are a tourist, please remember to bring sufficient cash as there is no ATM or money changer nearby. By the way, the cafe closed at 6pm and not 7pm as indicated in their website. We told them that their website said 7pm but the staff just said we are wrong and they want to close at 6pm. I have attached a photo of what is indicated in their website which clearly shows opening hours till 1900hours. So will I be back again? Most probably not...

We stayed in Geylang for a week and we came here every morning for coffee. The people were very friendly and helpful and it's reasonably priced. The coffee and pastries reminded me of home and they were always spot on. The layout of the cafe is also very nice. If you're looking for something a bit more Singaporean then maybe this isn't the best spot, but if you're looking for great coffee then definitely give it a go! I would love to go back here if we're ever in Singapore again

Down a large road off the centre of Geylang resides Brawn and Brains. The large windows bathe the space in natural light and the space owes everything to the prevailing hipster look.But the comforts end there.Stealing from fast food outlets who prefer a fast flow of customers, Brawn and Brains' stools are small and hard. The offered comfort doesn't promote a "sit around and chat" atmosphere.Brawn and Brains promote the a coffee conscious image. If all I cared about was image I could happily buy into this outlet. However I love coffee more than I love how it is housed. The coffee is so-so. Having lived around the Mediterranean for many years, I can't excuse a venue that doesn't include water with their coffee. Not only is coffee dehydrating and cloying without water, but the water helps clean the palate and keep the mouth fresh. Disappointingly Brawn and Brains didn't offer water immediately and refused to offer tap water. The only option is imported water.The food is ok but was western themed. It was a little cliched with the dish coming with packet crisps. Very few local people were eating here, mostly Europeans and North Americans, presumably looking for a reminder of home. For a traveller in this area, why not just eat something local instead? There is a great selection of low price food and authentic cooking along Geylang road. Even "The tuckshop" up the road would be a better place to drop in.If I was looking for a coffee I would have wanted to head to Collective Brewers, but now they have closed down. Instead, I'd rather head to "Curious Palette" on Prinsep street, or, if I can get in, "Space Mob", at 8 Claymore Hill
4
I was surprised when they serve my cappuccino with the clear glass, and I got my second surprised when I zip the cappuccino, is perfecto.I recommended this place if you want a great coffee. For me the house blend is perfect, can't wait to have another visit to try their other menu
4
We came across this hidden cafe as we were walking around which we then decided to stop by for breakfast. Staffs were really friendly and attentive. They even suggested us places we should visit and what we should do or shop there. The food was fantastic and portion was great. I'm obsessed with their caffe mocha as the milk, espresso and chocolate were perfectly balanced. Will definitely drop by again on our next visit to Singapore
5
We stumbled on this little Cafe on a walk around the area we were staying. It's a little hard to see from the street as it's behind a wire fence but once you find it, it's a place you'll come back to, as said, once you find it. There's a lot of coffees to choose from and the cakes etc are freshly made each day. The staff are so pleasent to talk to and a pleasure to chat with. I tried the Moulten Eggs which are different and recommend. Try this place as you will be pleasantly surprised
4
Who would think there's a nice cafe at this unlikely location! Very pleasantly surprised about the coffee here. They also have great house made baking goods. Although seating is not that comfortable, so minus one star. But still recommended!
4
Came here a couple of times during my time in Singapore, service was good. Tried their weekend brunch, satisfying too. It would be better if they have power outlet so we can stay longer with our laptops.
5
Really great food and tasty coffee.
Had the melted eggs and cheese with avocado, which was perfectly cooked.
Price is about average for this kind of cafe in Singapore.
Seems to be the only cafe of this type in the area, so it's very popular.
5
Was greeted with the most polite and friendly service staff who after a brief rant about a bad experience I just had came to chat. Have been here a few times and it does get busy at times but the service is always on point. Love thier coffee and salami sandwich (if I remember it correctly. Was too hungry and too good I quite literally inhaled it
5
Visited the cafe twice. The food is delicious and my favourite is the salmon with avocado sandwich while my other friends who tried other pastries all loved them. The coffee is kind of too thick for my liking. However the place is kind of noisy, not too comfy for long chit chats. It's self service but there will be waiting staff brings food to your table
5
I have been to many different places around Singapore to taste and try coffee, but Brawn & Brains have by far one of the best tasting coffee blends. Usually you can decide whether to have the blend or the single origin - both taste excellent. Besides, nowhere else in Singapore will you get such a lovely latte art on your macchiato :) I also like to drink espresso and generally I made the experience of rather acidly and bitterly tasting espressos in Singapore but not in B&B. The espresso has a nice, enjoyable flavor. Last but not least, the food is delicious too and the staff is very friendly, always in a good mood and unbelievably attentive. A great place! :
4
Brawn & Brains is coffee shop in Geylang.Generally most of coffee shop in This area is Singapore style, but this coffee shop is same as USA or other.Most of time many customers but below 10 minutes you can find sheet.Coffee in here is strong not same as USA' third wave like blue bottle.Staff here is very good.One of problem in here is too many customers.So after finish coffee then soon go out
4
If there is one thing I love about this cafe is that there is plenty of parking space in the complex itself! Using the old badminton hall Brawn & Brains (it has expanded now) serves delicious pastry and excellent coffee. Their cinnamon bagel with cream cheese has a lovely texture and is unlike most bagels in that it is not as chewy as some. Highly recommend you try it
4
Was recommended by a colleague to come here.Was a bit disappointed when I saw their lunch menu which was mainly sandwiches and wraps, as they didn't have the usual cafe lunch menu.However, was pleasantly surprised when I tried the Molten Egg with Avocado and Cheese. The eggs were just the right "runniness" and the melted baked cheese went very well. Added Smoked Salmon for $3.50 which was a generous portion. What was missing was some carbs, so I had to order a cinnamon bun and a hazelnut croissant to go with the meal.But if you are a coffee lover, then this is the place for you. They had 2 types today, a single origin and their house blend. I normally like to try more "exotic" flavours, so went for the single origin latte. It was GOOD ! So much so I wanted to try their house brand latte. And it was also GOOD !Not really that cheap a place for lunch though. Came to $70.50 for the 3 of us
4
This place has some of the best coffee I have ever had, the food was delicious and the staff ever so friendly, a lot of effort has been put in to this place to creating great food and coffee. Keep up the good work guys 
4
Visited B&B a number of times because the coffee is extremely good -strong espresso and they offer a single and mixed blend. The menu is limited but what they do they do well. The staff are very friendly.
4
Went for lunch after the rock climbing session at onsight, which is in the same building. The setting is simple, with raw cement flooring and stainless steel cabinets and shelf. However, still does not feel cold. In fact, the servers was always smiling. The seats, to me, was quite uncomfortable as it does not have any backing, so didn't stay for too long. There were 5 tables, some of which, are very long, to be shared with others. The food tasted nice and healthy, which, I normally do not associate the two together. The coffee is good too
5
These guys are great. I wouldn't have been able to find this place had it not been for tripadvisor. I had molten eggs for breakfast and a single origin and house blend short macciato. Eggs were deliciously runny and the avocado was perfectly ripe. I recommend their single origin for a smooth and more rounded flavour as apposed to their more harshly noted house blend. Both made very well. Staff are friendly and prompt to serve.100% recommended, and I will certainly be back
4
We visited on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. The variety is a little limited but I settled on what's essentially poached eggs with smoked salmon and additional avocado. It was thoroughly delightful, sufficiently filling and I would recommend it. The coffee was alright. Maybe I had hyped myself up too much but the beans just wasn't up my alley. In all, a nice place to hang out with friends though it gets crowded.
4
I love this place. Nestled in an old sports complex, the cafe oozes a charming vibe. Friendly staff adds to the charm. Not to mention their blend of coffee. Most days you get two different blends, single origin or house blend. They will take their time to explain to you the difference. Oh, and must try is their freshly baked pastries on display. Try it out
4
If not TripAdvisor I would never found the place - and I'm really grateful for it. I have not found any other place with real coffee at Gaylang, so saviour on the late morning. And this one has no sign so if you don't know that it is in badminton hall you will miss it.I liked their flat white a lot, iced latte needed extra shot.Cakes were nice, though I found croissants a bit too heavy (too much dough, too little butter).Generally nice place to stop by for caffeine intake
3
Their coffee is all around good. Not surprising when you see the La Marzocco machine. B&B offer a single origin and a house blend. The origin is great for an espresso or long black; the house blend in any others. Pastries: the earl lavender croissant is excellent, the chocolate walnut one okay and the cinnamon swirl too small and a bit sickly, I'd avoid it.Prices are competitive for the coffee at around $4 to 4.5, a tad above normal for the food & pastries, e.g. $4.20 for a croissant.The cafe is very spacious. Unfortunately the metal seats are terribly uncomfortable. Service can be too attentive. It happens often that within 20-30 seconds of finishing your coffee/food staff will be at your table to remove the empty cups and plates. We find it a bit intense. We were disappointed on our last visit. The staff was not willing to ensure egg yolks were cooked for a brunch dish my pregnant wife wanted to have. She simply can't have undercooked yolks as it poses a risk to the baby. B&B's reasoning was: "We can't do it because there are too many orders." We saw less than 10 dishes come out of the kitchen over the next half hour. This made me feel it was both not a reasonable answer, and poor attitude towards a regular. It's the first time in 6 months we run into a place refusing to make a very small accommodation this way. We will visit B&B substantially less, if at all
4
The location wasn't that great and the place itself wasn't the most comfortable (Crowded, noisy and uncomfortable seats). To make things worse, the toilet was far away and it wasn't very well kept. What they did right was they have really good products! The breakfast items, the coffee and the juices, fantastic! Food items do require a bit of a wait. They also have great and friendly staff and I appreciate great service. Just go easy on clearing the plates when we are done, I know you guys are trying to turn over the seats so more people can dine in. Overall, it will not be a place where I will go back specifically for another dining experience. But if you are around the corner, do drop by and enjoy some good coffee
3
Food menu only starts at 10am weekends. Good coffee. No advertising at front so a bit hard to find. Croissants nice. But busy with people so as soon as I had finished my last bit of coffee, cup and plate taken with expectation I move on quickly. Not a place to idly sit
5
The vibe you get from this bustling cafe is warm and friendly, with welcome smiles all around. All the servers were friendly, I had a sandwich to go, and was asked politely whether I would prefer to come back later for it when it was ready, and the young lady at the counter asked for my name.When I came back, I was greeted and thanked by name, a wonderful experience for a cafe of this nature. The beef pastrami sandwich was excellent, a light bread toasted well, with arugula, tomatoes and cheese all grilled with the beef, amalgamating into well balanced flavors, served with a side of crisps.Definitely a must try if you're in the area
4
No easy to find the shop, because it hide T behind a building, it feel like treasure hunt, me and my wife did enjoy the food & coffee, if you around this area highly recommend come and try.
5
One of the best in Singapore! used to be $3 plus but now a little more expensive. Still its worth every SGD spent.
Love their chicken wrap. Never had a better one in SG.
5
Recently moved next door into bigger premises but same great character. Simple menu and tasty sandwiches and good coffee :)
5
Really nice place for coffee and food. Best coffee in 2 months travelling Asia and the grilled chicken and mushroom sandwich was honestly one of the tastiest things Iv eaten in a while, Massive too! If you are Geylang it's definately worth going to and I bet you'll end up going back. Also staff were great, really friendly! :
5
Pleasant staff and great coffee! Now i am not satisfied with coffee that i get from anywhere else. But do note that their coffee is really meant for coffee lovers, so if you are used to the sweetened stuff like the ones you can get at starbucks, you may not be used to this.
5
I'm a coffee lover. I like it thick and strong. I haven't tried all the coffees in Singapore but I know a good coffee when I taste it. Tried Brawns and fell in love with it immediately. Was happy that the boss decides to move into a bigger premise. Used to cost $3.50 a latte (which is darn cheap) but they raised it to $4.50 now. But its still worth a cup a week I say :) starbucks should be ashamed. Apart from the coffee, I also had their panini which was lovely. Great combi with a latte
4
Was recommended by a friend who hangs out here. Great coffee, I tried the flat white. We had lunch already, so it was just a coffee pit stop for us. The place is cosy with long tables and short metal chairs to sit on. Aircon is cold, which is important in this weather!! The staff are friendly and helpful. I will come back here again for sure!
5
Found the coffee shop by accident and glad I did. It is difficult to miss from the street but if you see the gym you are there.The staff have to be commended on their hospitality. The coffee was amazing and the quality of the beans was evident. Liked the long tables which were good to work at. Great place for coffee, work or a chat
5
This tiny place is near my hotel, and I read good things about it on-line, so I went looking for the restaurant. I had the address, which is a medium-sized building on a major road. The main tenant is a wall-climbing gym. I walked through the building looking for the restaurant, without success. Eventually, I walked out the back and turned left, planning to walk around the outside to the front. I had given up, but there it was! Brains and Brawn. Definitely hard to find. No signs of any kind. A tiny place. But the food is really good. Another reviewer recommended the beef pastrami sandwich, so I tried that, and it was really just perfect, as well as reasonably priced. I had an iced coffee latte with my sandwich, and it was also perfect. The staff are friendly and helpful. Everything is prepared to order. I could not be happier with my whole experience. And I'll be able to find it when I return

I stumbled upon this nice little cozy hideaway in Guillemard tucked away just far enough from the busy streets. Because of the limited space available, the small chairs and tables are uncomfortable except for the common table inside. The coffee blend is widely used in Singapore so nothing exceptional about it. Over a couple of visits, I have grown quite attached to it, stopping by if Im in the area. Usually I would ask for a long black with a dash of milk on top, because I actually wanted a long macc - but I know this is open to interpretation. So in my last visit, unfortunately, I asked for a long macc immediately, but I had a feeling this would be misunderstood. So I managed to tell the cashier in time that its like a long black with a dash of hot milk on top. I was then offered a very small cup with some milk on top. I think they have misunderstood it as a double shot macc with milk. So I got a short mac instead, to my interpretation. So nevermind, I asked the cashier if she could change it to exactly when I had in mind. Soon afterwards, the barista came over and told me that next time I should be more specific about my order, because this is the way they do long maccs in this cafe. I told her that I did explain my specificity. I felt the approach could have been friendlier and subtler, and I took offence that I was told in a childish manner. Well in any case, I didnt feel like ever going back
