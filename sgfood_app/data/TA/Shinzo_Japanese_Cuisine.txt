We went for the early bird omakase which has a time limit on your meal. Sashimi slices were generous and the tempura is good. Very decent quality for the price point.
5
I like the food there. And the service by the waiter and waitress are excellent.
I will drop by again if given the chance to Singapore for business trip.

I ordered a wagyu beef set lunch which was about average. There is nothing outstanding and the quantity seems to have diminshed. I thought the food I had was much better when I visited this restaurant one month ago.
5
Fantastic food, great service, freshest of produce. Perfect!
Decent portion meals and good attention to dietary constrains.
Reservation is highly recomended!
5
Have come back to this place many times. It's a small place hard to get seat. By accident sawbcan use Chope to book. Very convenient. Set lunch are value for money. Come around 1.30pm if can't get reservations as they close 2.30 for lunch.

Being a regular at this sushi bar, assures us great service and the best food options. The chefs take care of all diners serving the most delicious cooked food and the freshest sushi. If something is not up to par, they will suggest a different fish for your sushi. To top it, their dishes are innovative and clever. The price is worth the experience
4
Good food but was busy so chefs taking care of another party so we were at the entrance and saw little chef activity and zero food prep. Service a bit slow but good altogether and will go again. Pricey but somehow exclusive and food fresh and goo
2
came here for my friend's birthday dinner.We ordered the $68 omakase early dinner set.Food served was very average, and doesnt seem value for money. No uni no hotate no ootoro.Just cheap ingredients.The chef did not bother to explain the dish, just kept talking among themselves
3
Food was good, not exceptional. Place was a little noisy and chef was drinking alcohol on the job. Not sure how to feel about that. Chefs and servers are chinese speaking, did not feel like an authentic japanese food experience. Would recommend if you're in the area and feel like splurging on some slightly above average japanese food.
5
Having tried a few different places I must say Shinzo hit the Right note with me. Exec Chef Lawrence Chia was on hand to take care of us and he's recommendations were great and according to our preferences. U know how some places just serve u the most costly and worse part it's something u don't really fancy. Hahaha Highly recommended for those who wants a cosy and yet not to loud environment. Just a pleasant evening with friends type
5
The food was good and the service was great. We had a pleasant dining experience.
Keep up the good work and worth visiting another time soon.
5
Thank you chef Lawence Chia and all staffs to make my wifeâ€™s birthday a memorable one!
For sure we will come back again and again!
5
This is a favourite for excellent sashimi, sushi and cooked food. Good sake menu too. But best of all, is the excellent service from the chefs and waitstaff.
4
My first omakase experience and it was amazing! Sashimi was fresh, sushi was very well done.
I personally liked their special dish, the Chilled Thin Udon in Truffle Oil. Definitely worth a try :)
5
This place is just perfect. Excellent food, great chefs, top service. Small restaurant but the set up is just awesome. Probably need reservation, we were just lucky I guess getting a seat when we arrived.
5
I like the casual atmosphere where you can see the chef prepare the food. A bit rowdy the night we were there as there was a hen party. Very one was quite high with too much sake. Chefs are really friendly and engaging.
3
Food was average. There are better value places. Not good to go with clients unless you are a regular as they get all the attention. Noisy and cramp. Wait staff is attentive.
4
This was not my first and definitely not my last, given the great foodie and nice ambience. Although I was abit turned off in my last visit 3 days ago. It was my wife bday, opted for the $188 omakase. While I understand omakase means 'leave it to the chef', I cannot comprehend why the others get the 'kokabu' for the same set but when I asked for it, I was being charged for it, where the rest got it as part of menu. The other turn off was the long waiting time for items to be served, it was full house.. abt 18 -20 pax, but there was 4 chefs running ... well, I guess good thing must wait. Nonetheless, the food was really good and fresh, nicely presented, and the waitress were prompt in service as usual, credit to the staffs.
4
A hidden gem at the area. I won't get to know of this place everytime I passes by till my friend recommended. Omakase dinning! Every dish serve is fresh and good! Chef is very entertaining and I reckon most are regular customers. Need to make a reservation as the place is rather small. One downside is it can get rather rowdy when it fully packed due to the small area. But thumb up for the freshness of food
5
Place is small and cramped, just like a true blue eatery in Japan. The chefs are very friendly and take the trouble to ensure that all our similar dishes are served at the same time. Freshness is guaranteed; had the best time savouring every dish. Depending on other patrons, it can be very rowdy (which can be fun!) or private. Worthy visit indeed
4
A casual yet high quality omakase ingredients , min 200 per pax excluding drinks, hence if you feeling a little budget, go for the early omakase dinner or just order ala carte and enjoy the drinks. Try ask for counter seats.
5
Friendly staff who make customers feel at home every single visit. Omakase always surprises the taste buds!
4
A nice variety of set lunch to choose from. Small restaurant with authentic Japanese cuisine. Service is friendly and efficient. Sashimi were delicious. Must book during week day
4
Been to Shinzo a couple of times. And they never fail to impress me with the quality of food. But this time, I felt rushed to finish my food and can't enjoy myself. But overall, still satisfied with the food.
4
Returned to this little gem again. The food is authentic and the cosy atmosphere is great. Overall, superb value for money.

We went early to try the omakase meal that came up to $80ish per person. Had a total of 9 courses. Service and plating were mostly great. Food wise, there were hits and misses. Generally a tate salty for me. Lower price omakase meal average at best. Would need to go the the full price menu for the more "refine" dishes. 1) salad with Japanese vinegrette was refreshing. (2) cod fish with sweet and sour vinegar was great - a flavour I have not tasted before (3) sashimi was excellent - especially the yellow fish roe and slightly charred swordfish. Yum! (4) The salmon steak was overdone and rather salty so for me definitely a miss. (5) love the chawanmushi with a touch of truffle oil. (6) tempura was my least favourite - batter was flat. (7) miso soup had good flavour with very smooth tofu. (8) sushi was just above average. (9) dessert was kind of disappointing as it was just a scoop of yuzu sorbet in a small clay bowl. All in all, a meal that started very well and ended kind of flat.
1
We came here based on much of the positive comments on TA but this is a very bad experience of how not to run a Jap restaurant, so bad that we felt like just paying halfway and leaving.The positives :The chirashi zushi was really quite good. So was the inaniwa udon. Ebi tempura was so so. The omakase set was much touted but prob average in quality but took way too long esp as the main chef wad busy drinking and toasting his regular customers. Not once did he come over to say hello. Stuckup.Anyway the negatives:Though we had a reservation, it seems like regular and famous personalities can just drop by like flies and squeeze into already the limited space. At last count, there were more than 30 customers squeezed inside the restaurant. Am sure the fire safety limit have been breached but the mgt seemed nonchalant about it. Just busy getting adding more and more chairs to the chef's table. They shldnt take patrons safety for granted esp with open fires and grills in the open kitchen. If there was a fire,,,,long narrow restaurant with only one small door and 50 people trying to get out..There were a few TV personalities and some Taiwanese regulars present and they turned the whole place into one big Ginza bar. Singing, boisterous shouting, loud cackling by half drunk customers...this is really not the right place to have an omakase dinner. Worse of all, the chef owner was going around pouring whiskey with this bunch of regular customers, who were all getting high and tipsy. Like a typical sleazy ktv lounge...papasan force-selling drinks...And the boss was trying to impress his audience by boasting all the whos who who had dined here and who was coming to dinner later that evening. The last thing I want when I dine at a fancy restaurant is to hv an advance propanganda team broadcasting our coming and breaching our privacy.Service was painfully slow. But who could help it when the boss is busy entertaining his friends and ignoring the bulk of us. Worse, for the same menu, his friends got 2 slices of the Jap melon whilst we only hv 1 slice like the rest of us. Pity the service staff who were trying their best to cope with this dysfunctional and poorly run restaurant. The noise was so loud no one coyld hear what we were saying and we couldnt even hear what the waitresses were trying to explain what was being served.Perhaps mr lawrence chia shld take a philgramage to Japan and see how professional michellin starred Jap restaurants are run...professionally. He should remember all clients who walk thru the dinner paid good money and shld be treated fairly and to hv their deserved dining experience, not to feel like a 2nd class peasant who had barged into a private drinking party. They would never allow a few boisterous customers (no matter who) to spoil the experience of the majority of the patrons. But cant help it jn this case, it is the owner himsrlf who was keeping the party going. The other guests who were sitting alongside with us also sighed with the same sadness. Good evening wasted. No matter how good is the food, it never taste good in a loud bar environment. That is why to date, no bar ever won a michellin star. No one can eat well in a place like this.Terrible experience. First and last time we would be here. Unless you are part of his regular party

I have been to Shinzo about 10 times in the past 6 months and this place is amazing!The food is the finest I have found in Singapore (below 50++ per person). Everything is prepared in front of you when you order, with excellent products!The salmon set lunch for 38++ is great with 6 dishes of great taste. The sashimi melts in your mouth... the staff is very caring and adorable!I cannot say anything negative about this place !! Just try it for yourself ;)Make sure you make a reservation, even for lunch
5
The lunch sets are a steal at 38/45/68SGD++.The main dish (unagi/tempura/sashimi/chirashi/wagyu, kurobuta cats) come with delightful salad of greens, seaweed and kani, chawan sushi (easily one of the best in Singapore!), miso soup (the one served today used a savoury fish stock), slices of ripe watermelon and gala melon, and hot/cold roasted barley tea. The place is modestly appointed (generally a sushi counter) and seats are limited, so it is wise to secure reservations. Service is not the most brisk, but friendly. The early-bird omakase dinner (68SGD++) is something to try on the next visit! There are bento sets too. Highly recommendable

A good friend invited me and my colleague to lunch at this place after I shared that I wanted to have light meal. Was expecting a simple cafe or salad place but it turned out to a Japanese restaurant along Carpenter St. As we stepped in, my colleague met his old classmates, I met my friend and his wife on a lunch date, after that my colleague met another old friend. This is really a great place for chance meeting. Back to the food, we tried the Shashimi set lunch which comprised: salad, shashimi (salmon, tuna, seared scallop, prawn, sword fish, squid - the seafood was very fresh), tempura (5 pcs assorted), tuna maki (6 pcs), bowl of noodles, green tea ice cream. I think the pricing was S$36. A very filling lunch, not so simple and light at the end as I could not finish the noodles and left one tuna maki untouched. Service was very friendly and the chef (guess he is also the boss) met us and passed us his name card. Thanked us for the visit and hope we could continue to support him again.Will remember this place for the things that happened today. A meeting place of good friends over good food
4
Great food at great prices. Will definitely be back again for more. Seared scallops with foie gras takes the cake!
5
Food is lovingly prepared, reflecting the friendly nature and warm embrace of the restaurant. Drawing out the best of the seasonal items, we were treated to a scenic culinary adventure...
Absolutely great!
5
First time there and loved it. Will be returning with rest of family. Look for Cayden - friendly dude who served us.
4
Shinzo is one of my favorite rastaurants. I recommend early bird omakase dinner menu due to its reasonable price.
5
Food was delicious and service was great. Service was prompt and everyone was friendly. Would definitely return in the near future..
5
Chef Lawrence & Daniel create a Tokyo experience in Singapore's Chinatown. Go before 7 for a cheaper alternative to their high-priced omakase dinners.
5
1st time here, heard good reviews about the Omakase & decided to try it with friends. Never regretted my choice, the sashimi are fresh, all the dishes are tasty & yummy! The chefs & waitresses are all very friendly. If you are considering big group gathering here, bear in mind that the restaurant is set for Omakase cuisine,as such, conversations with friends can be tricky especially if the crowd is rowdy at times. Overall, great place for Omakase dining
4
Had lunch here with my colleagues. We choose the set lunches (around $38), we had the fried pork and the chirashi ones. Both are delicious but the thing I loved the most is the sashimi that came with the sets. Super fresh and very nice texture. Highly recommended! It's a small place so I would recommend booking. Service level is decent.
3
Food was fantastic and preparation was fast. However there were screaming children playing in the corner, ,causing a huge disturbance to our conversation in such an enclosed space. On top of that, halfway through the meal the music suddenly blared out causing a shock and making it close to impossible to talk. We had to ask the waitress to turn down the volume after awhile. This really soured our experience there.
5
We had the early bird omakase special to celebrate our anniversary. There were a total of 9 courses including dessert, with each dish meticulously prepared and served with a smile and an explanation as to the ingredients of the dish. Our favourite dish was probably the cold silken tofu topped with century egg puree and egg roe - every mouthful was bursting with umami/sweet flavour! It was also an interesting experience dining while watching the chefs exhibiting their superb culinary skills in preparing the upcoming courses. The chefs were personable and looking around the place we could see that other diners were clearly regulars, as they seemed very comfortable in conversation with the chefs. All in all a cosy and classy experience - would definitely recommend shinzo to friends and family
5
Great quality of food, value for money. Serving was attentive and friendly.
Food was not rushed and one hour is just perfect
3
Fun experience and definitely worth it for the early-bird price. Would have been nice to be seated in front of the chef though, so we could enjoy watching the prep.
5
Tried the Omakase & it is the most yummiest Japanese cuisine I ever tried. Food r fresh & tastefully prepared & presented. Chefs & servers there r polite & professional. Even diners there r friendly.
5
Very friendly chefs. Food is very fresh and affordable!!! I feel more like their friend than a customer.
Definitely recommending it to others!
4
Enjoyed their set lunch and sushi a-la carte. Good food and great service. wish they would open on Sunday's too.
5
Omakase experience at Shinzo was certainly an unforgettable one! My personal favourite is the Uni Chawanmushi which is pure decadent goodness!
5
Food and presentation was excellent. We enjoyed the warm and friendly atmosphere. And lots of Sake choices to enhance the experience!
5
the food was fresh and good. We had the lunch set, which was value for money. We went on a Saturday, the place was empty and we had the whole place for ourselves.
4
I think it is value for money. The ingredients cannot be that premium given it is priced much lower than the usual 168++ and up. I particularly like the shashimi, which was fresh, the fried pork cutlets, and the chawanmushi with the flavourful broth. Overall, good flavours. I will recommend i
4
We had the $68 early bird special. Very good value, the food was excellent!Sashimi was fresh, especially love the grilled cod fish. The miso soup was excellent to end the meal. Toilet is also clean.Although service was attentive it was perfunctory and service staffs drag their feet which is irritating.The sliding door of the only entrance of the restaurant was hard to close, at such warm air rushes in as a discomfort of customer sitting at counter nearest to the entrance.Hokkien seems to be the most comfortable language among themselves and the customers
5
We tried the early bird Omakase menu for our first visit there. Everything was good and we are going back for the full course Omakase!
4
love the food and cosy ambience! the chefs were also really friendly and even recommended nearby cafes for coffee!
5
Really enjoyed tge meal, great staff. Early bird omakase special a fantastic deal. Excellent quality food great service. Definitely recomn nd.
4
it was a good experience but unfortunately they were over booked and we were pressured to leave even we were thinking of ordering extra dishes! Overall food were fantastic!!
4
Had meals several time at Shinzo. The place is quite small as it can sit only about 20 odds guests at the counter. You need to have prior booking otherwise you can't get yourself a sea. It was a good experience as all of guests are facing an open kitchen and you can see 4 or 5 chefs cooking your food. 2 or 3 at the sushi counter as the counter is really long. One chef in charge of cooking the tempura and grill and another chef in charge of cooking, either steaming or boiling or nitsuke, etc.All the food served are fresh and good quality and we really enjoy very much.I enjoyed most are the sashimi and sushi, very fresh and good quality. All the chefs have very good rapport with the guests and you shall feel very enjoyable talking to the chefs. The chefs will also make sure to get any feedback on the food
5
First time visiting this restaurant and having Omakase dinner. Although we were seated at the smaller second counter, it afforded us more interaction with Chef Jack Chang. The experience with Jack was great as did cater the dinner to your liking and dislikes. Also, when he explains some of the dishes and the subtle flavours like the umi.Each dish served was fairly unique and some were his own personal creations. The Shiga beef pieces just melted in your mouth. The sushi and sashimi were very fresh even with fishes that traditionally have some fishy smell. Overall the atmosphere was great even with the main seating counter full of people booked for a major birthday celebration. Chef Lawrence even made the effort to come over and get to know everyone by name
5
Brought my girlfriend here for her birthday with the early promotion Omakase. Quiet ambience for the early evening. Service was great with staff clearing your plates once done. Food was of good Japanese quality. Crowds are mostly executives or SMEs bosses who are regulars.Chefs were mostly Chinese and speak Cantonese & Hokkien. Not the perfect Japanese Omakse experience that i have envisioned with Japanese-speaking chefs giving you sushi by sushi, but this is still special.. Will not visit with the exorbitant dinner prices.
1
I am writing to express my disappointment. Although I made a reservation for 1 PM today (and your staff even called me in the morning to confirm the appointment), when I attended at your restaurant, I was told to wait without any firm indication as to when I could take my seat. This embarrassed me as well as the client that I brought along. Worse still, I felt that preferential treatment was given to the other customers who could have been gently told that their seats were needed since they have finished eating. Yet nothing was done. I was simply told to wait. If the restaurant was full, why did you accept my reservation? Did you accept customers after my reservation thereby depriving me of my seats? Originally I was planning to bring two separate group of clients for lunch at your restaurant next week. I however will not be back again. I simply can't trust whether I would be treated in a similar way again
4
5 of us has a great Omakase dinner .... most of all the fun conversation we had with the chefs. The kitchen is right in our view and they are very detailed and timed serving each serving to ensure they are just cooked and warm. The sashimi and sushi are so fresh.I love the grilled cod with the sweet onions sauce. The service is exemplary and would definitely rate this value for $ for the fresh food.
5
If you appreciate Chefs who love cooking, this is the place to be. Chefs take the time to find out your dietary preferences before customising the perfect Omakase set for you. Top quality ingredients are no short in this placeGreat food, great service and a clean restaurant
5
Lovely ambience, with friendly chefs each performing their artistry in their respective fields. Great food of course!
5
Always friendly and cosy, Shinzo is a delightful place for delicious and fresh set lunches! Sashimi and sushi lunch sets @$38++
5
Juz simply fresh stuff & good service. Salmon is my favorite but they do serve real good beef too. Not the 1st time there, definitely will not be the last!
4
We had the early bird omakase promo so the dinner was absolutely worth it! Excellent food. Some interesting dishes include sesame tofu and herring fish roe. Felt that the sashimi cut was a bit small. Other than that, very pleased. :)
5
Food was good.
Location near Clarke quay mrt
For the early bird dinner the price paid was very worth it for the amount of food we ate! Get the sake to go with it :)
4
Had omakase lunch, overall quality is very good but just find the price a bit too expensive. Would visit again but only for business. Also, the seats are too cramp.. I'm elbow to elbow with the guy next to me.
4
I brought my parents with my family and ordered 5 value lunch sets.
The food was a little on the salty side.
But the food in general is awesome.
Will definitely revisit.
4
The food is great and the chefs are really friendly. It feels really authentic. There also seem to be a lot of regular customers!
5
You don't need to order, just leave everything to Lawrence, he will cater to the needs of your tummy. He will line up dish after dish, while we sip sake together. He would slid across the floor behind the counter, every few spare moment to chat with us and then give us the fist high-five before downing the cup of sake.It was good fun, good food and good wine. Fresh delivery of fish, directly from Japanese, except Salmon, on Tuesday and Friday
5
For disclosure we have frequented HINOKI where Lawrence Chia was head chef before and we know him well.No bias here I call it as I see it and we took one of our friends along to experience.Picture tell it all . Food is great , always is but what makes it is the interaction with the kitchen and chefs but also fellow guests .Where else in the world will you fellow diner share his Chataeu Lafitte Rothschild with you.5 Star evening , very drunk and sated 
4
Very good service and the Chef and staffs are helpful and able to explain what we are eating. It was my 33h wedding anniversary Dinner and no regrets eating there.
4
I had dined here twice for the past two months and always surprised by the different things we can expect different expectations. Try the sushi table, you be surprised on how spontaneous the chefs can be to ensure you have the excellent dining experience.
5
Excellent food at a reasonable price. Service was efficient, friendly and unintrusive. Very enjoyable experience all round!
4
Had a great meal with family. Food was delicious, the chef and staff serving were very friendly. Was very good value for money for the quality and quantity of food.
4
Great food. Good Service! Wonderful chefs! This is the place to be for Jap food prepared before your eyes!
4
Shinzo joins the ranks of locally run sushi joints with very good quality food. I found the sushi very fresh, not like run of the mill sushi restaurants. I also like their other dishes like their Japanese wayu, a bit pricey at $95 per piece but every bite makes it worth it. The foie gras scallop is also a delicious and unusual combination.By the restaurant's own admission they are not strong on desert, only ice cream available. But with the fabulous main meal available, they can be forgiven.Go and check out this place, for no fuss, no pretension, honest good food
5
Awesome food - The very first time I came, I knew my palette had fallen in love. The second time I came, my partner paid 120% of the bill. They deserved every cent we paid. Awesome service - The second time I came, the chef could recognise me as the person who sat in a certain corner of the restaurant, and could tell me what I ordered then, and enquired whether I wanted the same thing again. The third time I came, he did the same. The staff are amazing. They know what you want before you even ask them for it. They are really amazing. Awesome price - I meant awesome in the sense of really quite expensive. Haha! Go during lunch time, it is cheaper. If you must go in the evening, make sure you make it in time for the 6pm early bird deals. Anytime after that, make sure you savour every bit of the excellent to forget the damage on your wallet. But in any event, it's still worth it :

Brought here by girlfriend for a surprise birthday dinner. Restaurant is owned and helmed entirely by a team of Singapore chefs. First, praise where praise is due: Food was great and value-for-money, and chef Daniel was friendly and engaging. Unfortunately we did not get a chance to interact much with Head chef Lawrence. Everything was good until first, the waitress brought us the bill even before dessert was served (a bit odd, but still alright by us). Next, after paying the bill, my girlfriend politely asked the waitress about my surprise birthday cake (girlfriend had called a few days ago to ask if this could be arranged, and the restaurant had given a very enthusiastic yes). Turns out it wasn't arranged after all, (which even then is still fine; restaurants get busy, mistakes happen), but instead she was met with a very irritated and stern reply from the waitress, along the lines of "Look, I already informed the chefs but they're just too busy as they have to prepare for the next seating" (I further checked with chefs Daniel and Lawrence, but they were not informed, i.e. the waitress was lying). Her tone of voice was so bad that the girlfriend even teared a little, as this surprise had meant a lot to her (But kudos to Chef Daniel for trying to joke and lighten up the mood). Unacceptable attitude & service standards for any restaurant, let alone a Japanese one. With the high volume of Japanese restaurants popping up all over Singapore these days, we'd be extremely hard-pressed to find a reason to return to this restaurant, no matter how good the food was
5
Great Place , Great food, great chef we will back very soon, Eccellent chef Daniel Amuse me And my wife, We enjoy every minute of our lunch we will try dinner .... No words to explain u must try ... No fuss easy and sincere Japanese food made with passion
4
me and my friend really enjoyed the full services from them. the food are great as well. its really highly recommended for you to eat in here.we tried their early omakase dinner, and we would be back to eat for their normal menu for sur
