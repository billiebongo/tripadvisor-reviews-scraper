We had been here some years ago and wanted to go back and try Hainan Chicken with Pyramid shaped rice.
Yo this we had fried pork ribs and vegetables.
Drinks were Chinese tea.
Good tastes in good company.
We will come back.
5
Sometimes after all the fine dining you need some good old comfort food and you get it no where else but Boon Tong Kee. Love the tender white chicken here, aromatic rice and awesome chilli!
4
A very popular chicken rice place which has queues all the time. One of the best chicken rice place although the other dishes are average. The SGD 5 takeaway Chicken rice is the best deal ever.
3
Always 1 of the go-to places for chicken rice, or singapore food for that matter. This location is more central than the other ones. But come early or late, peak meal times are a pain to queueThe elderly female staff are friendly and quite the hootFood is alright - chicken rice, vegetables, fried tofu etc. Ok at $25 per perso

I wanted to try the chicken rice at this restaurant chain so dragged my husband to the River Valley restaurant. We ordered the half Hainanese chicken with two bowls of rice, the Kang Kong and a French Bean and Scallop dish. I was really happy with all the dishes and would each at the restaurant again next time I go to Singapore. The chicken was tender and tasty and the bean and scallop dish was fresh and crunchy. The scallop dish was a bit on the pricier side and we paid a bit more than what we would have if we went to a Hawker store but I would recommend it

Average chicken rice, I went there just because my friend love their chicken rice but not me. Been there twice and not really like that place now. An incident that I wanted to take tablets when I finished my meal and I ask for a glass of warm water to go with it, and didnâ€™t know I got charged at S$1 when I paid the bill. The staff need to be re-train on how to inform your guest that everything you ask for is chargeable. And honestly I didnâ€™t expect that. Secondly, I donâ€™t think itâ€™s hygiene to put the peanuts on the table and re-use it again when the guest left (saw them doing it). Again, they like to put the peanut on the table and if you consumed even just a piece, they will charge it to your bill quietly without letting you know the price. Same thing they do it for wet tissue. HahaOverall, this is just my comment towards the restaurant. I will still go back if my friend wanna too. Definitely not my choice of place.

Food is fairly simple but very tasty. I visited very often cause it close to where we stayed. Their Chicken Rice is very famous they have have lunch â€˜setâ€™ portion for takeaway. They always have long que during lunch/dinner hour. Recommend if you are near by.
5
The great part is it's open till late, so its perfect after a night out and you need some good food. Their extensive menu doesn't limit you to only chicken rice. So its fabulous. The service is great and quality never disappoints. Its a landmark on its own
4
Visited this place for late lunch on a Wednesday and had the half chicken with chicken rice. It was very delicious! One of the best chicken rice I have eaten during my visit. The chicken was steamed nicely, soft and succulent and the rice was fragrant and tasty
4
This place had good food but just not we were expecting. We had heard so much about Singaporeâ€™s famous chicken rice BUT the chicken is cold with little flavour. The spare ribs were yummy and the deep fried tofu was absolutely divine. Service was very friendly and quick. Would recommend for the experience
5
Great spot for Chicken rice!
It's a basic spot with great local food. A must eat at spot... when you're in Singpore!
4
Very good chicken rice here. 10 minutes of queuing at this place really worth the wait. Fast service and delicious chicken rice. I love the ngo hiang or fried shrimp rolls here, very tasty. The double boiled chicken soup also not bad.
4
This restaurant is famous for its chicken rice and indeed is delicious. We ate a tasted chicken and a hainanese chicken rice and a vegetable soup with salty eggs. Everything was tasty. Service was friendly and extremely fast. The restaurant quite nice.
4
Not crowded during lunch time on weekday. Services were good but find the sitting space a bit cramp. If u go with kids/baby, best is to sit near the entrance. Food served in small portion. Can't order much because of the small table. Overall experience is good
4
Been to the other chicken rice places mostly at food courts and this is THE CHICKEN RICE to have. The rice is tasty and the chicken cuts are extremely fat and juicy. We were three hungry tourists and we happily wolfed down the entire chicken. Overall I was happy to get my chicken rice fix here.
4
I like to come to the River Valley branch because of the location, decor and the service. This is the usual place I bring overseas friends to taste one of Singaporeâ€™s most iconic dishes.I love to order the steamed chicken which served in chunky pieces and itâ€™s smooth and tender. The fragrant rice goes with the chili is extreme savory.This is my favorite chicken ric
4
Apparently this restaurant has been around for many years, but it looks like many other small Singaporean restaurants. We had to wait a bit to get a seat, as it is quite popular, but the wait was only a few minutes. We thoroughly enjoyed the excellent food, including great chicken rice and a lovely prawn dish. We also enjoyed a dish with green beans and scallops, although this was a little overpriced, I felt. I enjoyed having my rice served in a pyramidal shape (betraying my mathematical roots!). Staff were competent, friendly and attentive, without being overwhelming. A good place for a meal
4
As I need to dine past dinner time, it gets more and more challenging to find nice good eat. Boon tong kee is one of the few that actually serves great food till late. If you're a tourist I would strongly suggest that you do all your shopping in the day and when the shop closes, head to this place and have the famous chicken rice.I ordered something out of the ordinary which is the sweet and sour pork and it was served instantly. Though the portion of the rice on the chicken rice set is rather small.As for myself, I have always preferred Kampong chicken which is a much leaner meat but Boon Tong Kee would be the more well known name for the majority of the population. Service was good.One of the best restaurants in Singapore.The staffs speaks English, Mandarin and Cantonese.

@TheKuoKnowsBoon Tong Kee is one of the go-to place for Hainanese Chicken Rice in Singapore. With almost 40 years of experience, it should know how to boil a chicken expertly. And it does.The silky texture of the chicken is a testament of its years of experience. Half a chicken only costs $13. It's enough for three or, maybe, four diners.But there's more to BTK than just Chicken Rice. The Pork Ribs are a delight. And for the health-conscious, the Deep Fried Beancurd is cooked to perfection. But healthy eating can come at a price - the Stir Fried Kai Lan, which is superb, costs $12 a portion.Boon Tong Kee is just one of many Hainanese Chicken Rice eateries in Singapore. It shouldn't disappoint. And it doesn't

Decided to have dinner at Boon Tong Kee but decide not to order chicken dish.My Husband was craving to have the chicken RICE - Rice ! We decided to order 2 dishes. The Sambal Kang Kong and the seafood Claypot Toufu.Sad to say both dishes were very salty!Informed the staff of Boon Tong Kee about Both dishes . I must say, they are well trained in this!!! They offered immediately to have both dishes replaced without any further question !! Impressive

Located about 1 km from ion orchard
Great chicken rice
Service was OK
Worth to visit while in Singapore
4
We were the only non-Asians in the restaurant but were able to easily order our food. Dishes were tasty - with highlight being scallops and beans, and the mussels and calamari dish.
5
Its look so yummy , the hanging chicken ðŸ¤—it's a pity I don't eat chicken but my friend she gave a plenty of star rating. I believe her, she packed back to Bkk 555

This is quite an established Chinese Singaporean Restaurant. The dishes are quite typical of a Chinses Singaporean or Chinese Malaysian chef. I particularly like the steamed chicken and the chicken rice. The vegetable dish, Kang Kong, is also my favorite. Another popular dish is Deep Fried Prawn Rolls. I have not tried their Fried Chicken so far but they looked good to me. I noticed that there were 10 waiters/waitresses in that small restaurant and the service was really fast. There was always a queue on a weekend or public holiday eve. This is quite typical of a good Singaporean restaurant. Once you finish your food, you don't feel good to continue to occupy the table
2
I ate here with my family,the chicken rice was average,the sweet and sour pork was OK.Our table was near the street,someone outside was smoking which blew in to our table.For a similar price I can eat at the Ritz Carlton and get far better service and superior food
3
Had dinner with a large group of 8 recently. Chicken rice good, if not outstanding and the other dishes a little bit on the small size, portion wise.Tried the prawn toast which was good. Recommend to go to Balestier shop as I think the dishes got more flavour there, although this shop is close to Orchard Road and is around 20 minute good walk to junction between Orchard and Scotts Road after dining there!Expensive by local standards, but tourists keep flocking there
5
On the day, we were not that hungry so we did not order a lot. We had tried the fried tofu, Hai Nan Chicken rice and lime juice. I loved the portion sizes because it was very fair and the taste of the hai nan chicken rice was excellent.
3
Back in town and dropped by for this reliable favourite. We knew to arrive early at 630 and got a table. 645 the queue starts, on a weekday , and gets very long after 7. On weekends, even longer Had the usual chicken, tofu and vegetables with egg. All decent
4
Yummy food and friendly staff. The first dish I forgot the name we ordered from recommendation here but a bit too oily. The chicken is really a lot for two of us that we couldn't finish. The staff is super friendly to show us the way to our next destination
4
Better late than never. Came here back in June of 2015 when visiting Singapore. This was closed to Fraser suite apartement. We had wanted to eat more chicken rice to see which place offers the best chicken rice. This place serves some good chicken but in my humble opinion, it did not beat Tian Tian. We had stirfried bean sprouts, seafood claypot(had abalone), fried tofu, pork belly with perserved vegetable. That was enough for 4. Only thing I did not like was the cramp bench seating, feels too close to the table
5
Stays here for a business lunch. The best chicken rice I ever eaten and ever seen presented as pyramid! Also che roasted duck is wonderful a fresh juice are home made.
5
A regular dinner haunt in the Neighbourhood with excellent chicken rice and the variety and quality of zhe char dishes is also great.
4
A big fan of chicken rice, this restaurant takes it to a different level. Chicken rice are carefully prepared with great side condiments!
4
Hainan Chicken Rice tasted good, especially the boiled one. The roasted a bit dry for my taste. Many foreigners ate here. Price wise very reasonable. The fried tofu with green mayonnaise sauce also delicious.
5
I walked from Orchard MRT but it was a good walk. We ordered half chicken and scallops with green bean(?). The food was great as usual and i will always return to this place!
1
A rather disappointing dinner. No longer getting the "Wow" and "Yummy" with the chicken. Worse no fragrance on the rice like wat I had before. The chilli is very ordinary. Standard has indeed drop. I get better chicken rice at kovan hawker centre next to heartland mall for a fraction of the price.yuvenGiven feedback to the waitress on duty and she admitted that they have changed their usual chef. Won't go back there again at river valley outlet.
5
One of the best chicken rice in Singapore. Even as a Singaporean, I go there very often to dine in. The good there are great and there is aircon. The standard of chicken rice maintain even they had many other outlet. Car park is a little problem. But totally enjoy it.

This was my umpteenth visit over many years to this popular chicken rice restaurant. Eating there has always been an occasion to look forward to. This time we were in for a surprise! The service was perfunctory, but what came like a thud of disappointment was the taste of the sauces to go with the chicken rice. Both the Chilli sauce and ginger sauce were watery and lacked enough substance to give a good feel on the palate when eating the chicken. The most critical aspects of a chicken rice dish are these two sauces, together with the black soy sauce. If the Chilli & ginger sauces don't measure up then you could well be eating at any ordinary chicken rice place. One more point which I must state. Boon Tong Kee has a policy of not serving a bowl of plain chicken soup with the chicken rice, something which is de rigueur at any chicken rice place in town. Here they expect you to make a separate order of a soup from their menu, which obviously is meant to chalking up the tab! Frankly, in these days of rising costs, I don't see any goodwill earned by not serving simple, clear soup with the chicken rice. Overall it was a disappointing experience even though the chicken & rice were good. Until they improve the Chilli & ginger sauces, we told ourselves we won't be returning anytime soon.
1
Paid $43.50 for 2 plates of rice, 2 drumsticks, 2 eggs, a plate of spinach, a glass of barley ice & a lime juice. Probably the most overpriced chicken rice ever (exclude those chicken rice served at hotels). This place is just so overly rated. The chicken rice doesn't even taste or smell like the genuine Hainanese chicken rice. Standard has definitely deteriorate over the years
5
I've eaten here with my family since the early 1990s and this place is simply the best. My personal favourite is their rice which is so tasty you can have it on its own. I highly recommend visitors to Singapore to try out any of their outlets across the island.
4
Went here for early dinner with friend. At 18.00 already a short que. Wait for around 5 minutes to get a small table for two. Food simply delicious. Price is ok for a personal set menu.
5
Best chicken rice place ever! The place is always crowded at night so be prepared to wait. They also do takeout and delivery service.
3
When staying at Great World City and jet lagged this is a regular late night spot. Chicken rice is adequate but at 3am is tastes great.
2
It is still a go to place for most people looking for chicken rice, and the service is good, but they have become quite expensive.
4
It's a great takeout place for us! They accept phone order but no online menu available nor printed brochure! I took a photo of the takeout menu and it has been worked well!
3
There are a few Boon Tong Kee Duck stalls in Singapore. We tried the one at Zion Road Food Court. Sorry to report that the duck is dry and the taste is bland. The Kway noodle is of no big deal either ...
4
Very good lunch with family, the chicken rice and the sesame toast is great.
God service, quick and efficient.

When my friends visit India on business tours I take them out for dinners and when I visited Singapore they returned the favor by taking me out for lunch at this amazing outlet called Boon Toon Kee. It was my first experience and I also tagged along a friend of mine with me. Located at 425, River Valley Road in Singapore the first impression of the food joint seemed very-very popular as it was packed. We had reservations so no regrets on that front. What we ate Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Roast chicken, deep fried chicken, spinach with assorted eggs, deep fried beancurd, deep fried fritters, chicken rice all gulped down with coke and lemon juice. I had a good time trying the local cuisine which is so different than the spicy Indian fare that we are used to
2
The white chicken breast tasted so bad. The meat had some kind of weird taste, like those taste which is not fresh and perhaps frozen meat.The staff even messed up our order. We only ordered 3 dishes but the staff only sent us 2. It was not even full, perhaps only 20% occupancy during that time at 930pm. Not even apologetic. I hope they do not represent Singapore in Chicken rice for all the tourist as they are not up to the standard and tourist will be laughing so hard
3
Firstly - this is place is very hard to get a car park , we circled 4 times and eventually parked at Great World and walked away.We have heard great things about this place and wanted to try it . We were not dissatisfied with the chicken rice. The chicken was silky smooth in texture but I found the rice to be the best. We ordered side dishes - sweet n sour pork, prawn roll and beans sprouts. They were ok and fine. Iced water was $1 and the peanuts that was put in front of us was $2. I am surprised that there was no soup given with the chicken rice... Would we go back ?? Yes but will catch a taxi next time and have just the chicken rice only
4
It's indeed quality cook; it doesn't seem fancy from outside, but the menu has interesting dishes and it is definitively tastefull
5
This is my favourite Restaurant for Chinese food. I simply love every single dish especially their roasted chicken, sweet & sour pork and pork ribs! Very delicious! Thank you for providing outstanding food and service! Well done
4
For SGD 5 for a plate of chicken rice, this place is quite value for money. The chicken tastes silky smooth and full of flavour. Probably my only grouse is that they charge SGD 1 for a glass of water. Other than that, I would recommend this place.
5
You could easily miss this place or see it from the street and not think much of a spot to enter as is somewhat basic.However very clean with great friendly service and fast...I had the pleasure of being taken by a local who told me it was the best place in the area for the local favorite "chicken and rice".Sounds a little boring and sure, it's a simple dish.That said it is simply delicious and the rice is fragrant and simply stunning. Great spot and I look forward to being back to try other items on the menu
3
One of my favourite restaurant to bring my friends / associatesWas there yesterday againCrowd : Always Packed During lunchConvenience : open carpark behindFood : every branch is diff in type of dishes they carry, for river valley branch, unfortunately it doesnt carry my favourite crabmeat steameggPrice : $$$$ (expensive since the quality seems to be dipping)Ok lets keep this review to not only my recent experience but a overall experience over the years. I always like BTK chicken rice, chicken is smooth since they dipped it back into ice after steaming, rice is fragant, side dishes are ok..but quality seems to be dipping and u are in the end paying for a brand instead of the food IMONevertheless, for tourists still worth a try cause chicken rice is one of our local favourite
4
We visited this restaurant for dinner based on friends recommendation. We took a taxi there as there was no train stations nearby (MRT). They serve more than chicken rice. We ordered their signature steam chicken rice and it was delicious. Other dishes we ordered included the black bean ribs and a spinach and egg dish. Both were average and rather bland. I would recommend the chicken rice but not the other two dishes. Service was prompt. We walked in at 6.30pm. By 7.10pm, there was a large queue outside. I guess we were lucky as we did not book. Would recommend booking if you need a table beyond 7pm.
4
Good quality chicken rice. The place is a touch difficult to get to as no MRT station nearby, but the food is good including other menu items. Very reasonable price too. Seems to be a hit with the locals as this place got very busy from about 8pm. Will return next time in sg
4
Recommended by some people, we went to Boon Tong Kee to eat their famous Hainan Rice last month. The fragrant of the rice and the shiny rice are really tempting us to eat right away. We ordered Steam Chicken and the Roast Chicken, both are nice but I prefer the Steam one. They also offered us to try Clay Fish with Black pepper sauce and it was really good. Overall, this is well recommended, but one thing we have to notice, at Boon Tong Kee, the Hainan Rice is not served with clear Soup like in any other Restaurant
4
It was lunch, it was our last meal on our six days explorer of Singapore. We had a different chicken rice as our first meal in a hacker market. Coming to Boon Tong Kee since we hear it's one of the best and it was so close to the Fraser Suites River Valley we were staying, we had the chance to check out and walk over for a nice lunch before heading to the airport.Coming here was so different from the hacker market one, service was not so great. Not sure if it's normal in Chinese places in Singapore or just famous places...it felt the same at the hacker market one too...staffs I would considered rude...But overall, good and yummi food, but have to try the shrimp toast...a little pricey, but it was worth it, so juicy!!
5
Have the chicken rice. Steamed breast. Have the staple Singaporean dish and you won't break the bank at around 7SGD. Definitely a must have. While in Singapore. Also great for those who need a protein healthy diet low in carbs. I washed it all down with an Evian.
5
We kept coming back to this for the chicken rice! Tender and juicy, the sauce the perfectbpalance of sweet and salty. And the rice! Omg the rice!
5
Their Hainan chicken rice without a doubt is the best is singapore. Have many branches but this one in river valley is the best. Also try the soup and tofu. Service is fast and friendly.
4
Boon Tong Kee was highly recommended to us for its Hainanese (Boiled) Chicken, and it did not disappoint. Their chicken was tender and flavorful, and we liked the chicken rice as well. Their servings are large, and the prices were reasonable.
4
Rather good chicken rice and the waitresses do like to chat. Good clean tables.
Rice:good
Chicken: good
Atmosphere:good.
4
Price for chicken rice slightly above average. The other cooked dishes are great to complement the chicken rice too. The spicy chili paste specially made is a must try condiment.
5
Very nice food, especially good chicken rice................. had ordered sweet & sour pork, fried bean sprout with salted fish & deep fried prawn cake.
4
It's hyped up as one of the better places and it doesn't disappoint. You may want to order 2 portions. One is on the small side
2
Bought a few Chicken Rice to go.I was very disappointed by the quantity of the meat and also by the quality of the meat.One of them had no skin in the chicken.One of them had just boney parts of the chicken.Chicken Rice at some hawker center is actually better and cheaper.I will not come back to this outlet again.East Coast outlet offered a better takeaway.Takeaway costed S$5, which was more expensive than other outlets
5
Was there in Jan 2016. I love this place. Always tasty and juicy chicken.As the place is well-known, expected a long queue before my turn. As there was two of us and we weren't choosy with indoor or out, we got in quite quick. We had a half chicken and a plate of long beans. Delicious!You should eat here
4
We went at 11 pm after a trip from the night safari with our kids. We had the steamed chicken, tofu, bean sprouts, shrimp cake and rice. They are all very good. The steamed chicken is one of the tastiest and tenderest Hainan chicken weve tried. The rice is also perfectly steamed and not dry unlike other chicken rice. Will definitely come back here
4
The food was good, but I do not recommend budget travellers to eat here because it is very pricey! We paid 100SGD for a meal of 4 people!
4
This is a popular restaurant that stays open late. We were there at about 11pm on a Sunday night, so it was not too crowded. The service was good and the food was served quickly.
4
Best place to get Chicken Rice. My preference is for Skinless, white chicken rice set and they are the best. They Tofu chunks served with green mayonnaise is amazing. Tried Cereal Prawns, Kai lan with Garlic all was excellent. Will definitely come back.
3
This place chicken is quite the same as the rest of their branches. However the service here is slightly better than the rest.
4
I just visited Boon Tong Kee for the first time and I'm impressed that their service are very fast.
The chicken rice is fragrant and the chicken is tender and delicious.
I recommend you try their cuisine
4
Price is a little on the high side but chicken is tender and succulent, chili sauce decent and rice fragrant and fluffy. Service is also prompt and polite. Overall: very good.
5
Came here with my family, ordered their famous chicken rice (and some other foods), absolutely delicious (we even ordered more). But if you go alone (like my first time) or on a budget-traveling, it's kinda drain your wallet because of the high-priced food.
3
I have been to this shop and order fried been cured and chicken rice....It very delicious I love it and will come back if I come to sg....
5
This is our favourite Chicken & Rice place. Forget those highly recommended stalls in Hawker Centres. Boon Tong Kee is a cut above the rest. How do they manage to give their rice such intense flavour and light fluffy texture? Both BBQ and Boiled Chicken are good. We really enjoyed the pork spare ribs last time - so rich and tasty.
4
I know there are lots of restaurants that have chicken rice but, I do like coming back to Boon Tong Kee in River Valley Road. The rice is fluffy and fragrant and the chicken when dipped into the chilli and ginger sauce pretty scrumptious. I also like the tofu clay pot and if you're into offal, then add that to your order. The place is popular and fills up pretty fast but, I've never booked and always managed to get a table - albeit- you do have to wai
2
We had heard that this was the place for the best food. Our food was dry and tasteless. Maybe a bad night for us. The restaurant was packed and busy.
5
Wonderful food, choose wisely as the servings are large, even when sharing. The tofu dishes are spectacular and the soups are delicious. Good options for vegetarians. Come early and be prepared to queue as this place is popular with the locals.
3
this place outlived its reputation as one of the best Hainanese chicken rice stalsl in Singapore; food is expensive, long q, service not very friendly and no meaningful parking nearby,
3
Fairly decent chicken rice with above average pricing. Ordering is easy with pictured menu and an abundance of choices. Restaurant is pretty clean and have an air-conditioned sitting as well. However if you have had chicken rice in Kuala Lumpur or Ipoh, where it is much more authentic and tasty, then this one would fall slightly short of expectations. Decent meal but nothing to shout about
4
My employees/coworkers took me here for "the best Chicken Rice in Singapore" at lunch. Was an ok place, busy, but we were sat quick. Food/drinks came out quick. Chicken and rice were pretty good, guys order chicken intestines....I only had one it was ok. Fried tofu was actually ok, i'm not a tofu fan. Cooked sprouts were tasty. Lime drink was pretty good. Getting the bill took a long time, even for Singapore standards.Try one of these if in town
5
It is not THE best chicken rice in town, but it serves it purpose when you bring your client to dine here. It is air-conditioned, there is no waiting time, the chicken rice and the other dishes are still considered good. i would highly recommend the deep fried tofu with mayonnaise on the side. It's perfect setting for business lunch/dinner.
5
When we speak of Singapore, it is hard not to talk about it's signature dish, Chicken Rice. This place definitely offers one of the best (if not the best) chicken rice in town! I am not sure of people telling me that it used to taste better than today, but as I've tried it, it is still heavenly to this day!Other dishes are also good as well, including the Spinach with Three types of Eggs, and the Deep Fried Tofu. But the Chicken Rice is definitely a stand-out. Chicken is tender, not too oily, and well seasoned. Chili is just right, hot and tangy. Rice is not oily, and yet flavorful.I have tried many shops that are highly rated, which i find later on to be over-rated. But this one is a real deal.Prices are not so bad. I think it is within market price and definitely not overpriced.The place is airconditioned, that makes your eating so comfortable. I guess it helps that you can focus and taste the food better than minding the heat in the hot and humid Singapore weather. And for the price that you pay, It's just good that you've got an option to eat good food in the comfort of an airconditioned area.The place was not so accessible from the MRT, but who cares? It is not so far from Orchard Road, and buses are available
3
I would recommend order by parts of what you like. Drum sticks or breast, and the spicy source is just right match with the chicken meat. Sit outside if you dont like a tight seat (fast food style) and the wind is good for a late night supper
2
The Hainanese chicken was bland. the fried pork ribs was lacking in taste, they charge for the tea, the napkin and water. The chicken rice was average. We ate in this restaurant when we were very hungry just arrive at our apartment past midnight from airport, we should have like the food, but it really was not good. Service is also poor. Not enjoyable place for us. Now Boon Tong Kee is our joke, my friends favorite restaurant...where we will never go back again
5
Very conveniently located at River Valley, this Boon Tong Kee offers the traditional Chicken rice with a very good value. You can spend 20S$ at the hotel for less quality, while you can enjoy proper food with 6S$. They do offer other menus as well and the atmosphere is great to enjoy the full Singaporean life style. There are many locals here as well as tourists which is usually the good sign for the restaurant.
4
i think the food is quite delicious, allways packs with people, you have to wait in the queue to eat there, cause the restaurant is quite small, and full with people, they have recieved many awards from many culinary associations.
5
Boon Tong Kee is the standard when it comes to chicken rice in Singapore. You cannot get anymore authenthic than here. Everytime I'm in Singapore, this place is a must.
5
Yes my in-laws came visiting and I remembered they loved this place a year ago when we came by. This time round, still good.They are a long time favorite amongst our local Hainanese version of Chicken Rice, albeit, a pricey version of the local fare found in almost all hawker centers. We ordered:â€¢ Steamed White Chicken halfThe all-time favorite in Singapore, flavor-some succulent juicy chicken pieces... Yummmmmm.â€¢ Deep Fried ChickenTry it! It's different with a crispy skin as compared to other places serving the roasted version. I did say crispy skin.â€¢ Spinach with assorted eggsMy wife couldn't stop praising this dish which I'll admit, was done perfectly. ORDER THIS HERE!!Rice, Chinese Tea, towels and appetizer for 4 set us back $61.20Like I said, pricey but worth it if contending with the bellies of in-laws

This restaurant is not an honest establishment. It seems to belong to the same Boon Tong Kee group of restaurants but per Ah Leong (the Manager), it serves "higher class" food made from "premium" ingredients compared to the Ang Mo Kio branch, which is supposed to be the "lower class" version.I ordered some take away via phone and was attended to by Ah Leong. He took my order of Salad Prawns (which price was indicated as SGD15.00 on their online website).When I picked up my order of prawns, the restaurant charged me SGD42.80 (not including GST yet) for 1 order of Salad Prawns. I was flabbergasted as it was thrice the price that was listed online! When I questioned Ah Leong, he claimed that the price indicated online was meant for the Ang Mo Kio branch and that the prawns used at River Valley was far superior than that used in AMK, thus costing thrice the price.He was very aggressive and said that if I could not afford it, I could request for a refund and was extremely vocal about it, attracting attention from other customers. I was embarrassed, paid and left in a huff.I was surprised yet again when I returned home and opened my box of prawns because there were only 5 pieces of prawns, each no more the length of my little finger, coated with layers of flour. That means that each prawn costs about SGD9.00. By the way, the prawns were tasteless and in no way considered "premium".It is unbelievable how such unethical establishments still last in Singapore. Definitely not recommended as you will definitely feel cheated after dining there
3
My son loves chicken rice so we went here as it is meant to be one of the best. The service was fast and slick (and the service was good) but we missed the chicken broth. But that may just be us :) Chicken was very succulent and the veges yum. Price was steep compared to a hawkers market though
4
From that title, you can imagine how much i enjoyed the food. Okay, 1st, yes the food is pricey. I had my cousin saying that it was too expensive & nothing special. But i beg to differ. My sister & I were looking for some good food, chose this place & it was almost 11pm on a weekday so we weren't made to wait. Service was quick & fuss-free. Staff were still wearing a faint smile even so late into the night. We got ourselves: 1/2 Deep Fried Chicken($14.80), Sambal KangKong($9), Deep Fried Beancurd with Green Tea Mayo($8), Braised Peanuts as appetiser($2) & 3 plates of the locally-famous pyramid-shaped Chicken Rice(0.80cents each) *we ordered another plate of the rice cause it was really that good!*Total was $51.90Including 2 drinks, the wet tissues, service charge 10% & gst 7%.The rice was fragrant, the chicken was cooked well & the skin was delish ..although we thought it was a little small for the price, the sambal kangkong bagged just the right amount of sambal.. But the beancurd...omg, that beancurd stole the show. It was so hot. So fresh. The outside was fried to a beautiful light golden colour, & the insides were so soft, almost dancing when you dip them in that mouth-watering GREEN TEA MAYO dip. I would have never imagined that 2 going together, but it was a success! Even the simple braised peanuts appetizer is worth a mention,(cause i never had those b4 in my life!) & now whnever my heart & stomach long for BTK but my pocket has butterflies, i just get myself a can of braised peanuts.. while looking forward to dining there again.

Was recommended by hotel staff as quick and easy. Went there thinking it would be cheap and cheerful. Wrong! I should have known nothing so far has been cheap in Singapore. $42 for a very small serve of seafood. Best priced item $0.80 for chicken rice. All main dishes were over $40 so if you are considering this restaurant, you have been told. I don't mind paying for good food but it was nowhere near the quality it should be for the price. Also had crispy prawns which looks amazing but the taste was not so good for the western palette

Returned here to bring a foreign guest to eat the chicken rice. Arrived at 130pm to skip the queue and there was still short wait and lineOrdered half a chicken for 2 of us , plus tofu with crab and fried prawn cakes. All were good as usual, and it's always nice to see the smiles of foreign friends as they enjoy the mealReading "miserable lady" who gave this place 1 star, I also told the staff we didn't use the wet tissues and they promptly and correctly deducted the amount and showed me before deducting my credit card. I would say live life to that reviewer, as the owner of boon tong kee is probably a multi millionaire and doesn't really need your $1 for the wet tissue

I went to Boon Tong Kee 2 times during my stay in Singapore. The first time was for dinner and the second time for lunch. The restaurant open from 11.50 onwards so be sure to get there around that time otherwise you have to wait to be seated a bit more. We tried the original boiled chicken, roasted chicken, Sambal french been with scallop, Sambal kang kong (morning glory) and Yi-mien (crab noodle) and i think the boiled chicken and french bean with scallop are the best ! Also try the barley drink which totally go well with the food

Call me a miserable lady but this BTK Chicken Rice doesn't match its food to its price. Honestly the chicken is too bland if you really eat it without the chilli and black soy sauce. But with the saunce combi it's really good. Besides, if you are a fan of mushy food, you will be a fan of this one because the chicken skin has the mushiest texture you can ever imagine. Not for me, ew.We ordered the crispy tofu and many of the reviews said it's accompanied with wasabi mayo dip but nahh. It's GREEN TEA MAYO. Haha! Well, it is a good snack, crispy when it first came. Of course you have to eat fried food while it is hot. $8 for that 2pax- serving, alright.. The only thing that my bf and I promised never to come again is the dishonesty. Well, we, the thrifty couple, refused to use the napkins nor eat the appetizers because yesss, we've done our homework. The bill came with the napkins charge so we asked for a revised bill. When the lady came and told us YEP IT'S CORRECTED so we thought, oh yeah right okay and without a second look into the bill, we just paid with the card. But we realized as we were heading out that the napkins charge were included so you can imagine our faces. Of course who would go back in and demand for the napkins right since we paid for them? So we held our head high and left the shop with a pledge never to come again. YEP, ladies and gentlemen heads up for you, check your bill THROUGHLY

U nv go wrong if u go here for chicken rice. You can call them to ask them to takeaway so you can save time waiting for the food to be ready. N they open til late too, great place to go for supper

I have been here many time. i think this is the best restaurant for chicken rice. moreover, BBQ spare rib pork is delicious. Must try !!The price is reasonable. Value for money. The restaurant is a bit small. it may not convenient if you come with a big group.It open 11 am. if you want to have lunch. you should go early before 11.30 am. otherwise it will be a long queue

I always eat here whenever I'm in Singapore. The best chicken rice that I ever eat in Singapore.The condition of the restaurant is good. Comfortable chair and table, decent air con, eventhough the seating arrangement is quite a pack.Chicken (I always order drum stick, without skin), rice and dipping sauce are served separately. The rice is fragrant and not too oily. The chicken is firm yet smooth and tender. Ask for more dipping sauce, that's the secret.Beside that I always order scallop string bean. The scallop and bean are freshly cooked

My friend (who's a local) took me here when I visited Singapore. Nice ambiance, and for Singapore I didn't think the price was too expensive for the quality of the food (compared to other places I ate at). Food was really good, not super amazing but I would go back again.The style of the restaurant was pretty Chinese, cannot really commend on the service but it's not what you need to expect when you dine in this ambiance, it was fine.Overall a good experience, if you want good chicken, I recommend you come here. It's in river valley so for the traveller or tourist, you may need to walk a bit or spend money on a cab to get here as it's out of the main areas where tourists go (at least in my opinion)

It's a good place to try traditional Singaporean Chicken rice. However, don't expect too much. You can find this taste in many places. About the price that many people has mentioned, I found that it might be a little pricy compared to local food but for westerner or travelers from EU or America, the whole chicken for just $25 is really reasonable

Definitely the best chicken rice in Singapore -- sometimes referred as steamed chicken or white chicken. Tender, juicy and flavorful --- they serve it with the sweet dark soy sauce and chili sauce but I ask for the ginger sauce which gives it another layer of flavor. For the perfect bite, you should have on your fork the rice, chicken dipped into the three sauces and a small piece of cilantro. They don't take reservations so try to arrive when they open at 12nn.The other dish which is a must try is the "Raw Fish" --- its their version of ceviche but the fish is not marinated in vinegar only but a mixture of sesame oil, vinegar, soy, and cilantro. Aromatic and flavorful.Other dishes that are good are the fried bean curd, cereal prawn, green bean in XO sauce, and if you want to be adventurous -- the battered boneless chicken feet

Had a great meal there tonight. We found the simplicity of the meal exactly what we needed after a tonne of spicy meals during our stay in Singapore. We ordered half a chicken and some steamed veggies. The meal came out almost as soon as the order went in. The service was friendly and swift. The only thing strange was they charged us for some steamed peanuts and wet napkins even if you didn't want them. Also a service charge is included in your bill. So don't feel the need to tip. Other than that we would recommend this place

The rice is good, not fragrant. The chicken is large (lots of white meat), but really bland. The chicken liver is even more flavorless. Prawns are quite expensive - at $48++ a dish - and not as good as at Crystal Jade, Imperial Treasure, etc. Different people have different tastes, but I don't understand why there's often a queue at Boon Tong Kee, while less well-known Five-star Hainanese Chicken Rice a few doors away is often half-full; its kampong chicken is smaller, but more flavorful. For take-away, Five-Star is definitely better; you call, and when you come they even have change (from $20, $30, $40, or $50, etc) ready. At BKT, they even forget the condiments (ginger, brown sauce!!) Reputation can encourage excellence, but for Boon Tong Kee, celebrity is a key to mediocrity

tourist friend: tonight we are going to the river for dinnerme: where?tourist friend: Boon Tong Kee at RIver Valleyme: no no its NOT by the river at all.Advice: no reservations needed, a half chicken is not much different in size as a full chicken.Good points: good service, food served fast.baby chair providedOverall, pleasant dinner.....however I will be a happier person if I did not know about the fame of this chicken rice stallIt has been more than 10 years since i was in this place, its is more polished and a heavier price tag, this restuarant now tries to do too many things! We paid about $80 for 3 person, I will definately pay $4 for a street plate of chicken rice and that money to eat some chilli crabs.

We ordered steamed chicken, roasted chicken, shrimp, kangkong with shrimp paste chili, and chicken rice. Every single dish was excellent and nothing was left uneaten at our table. Simple food, quick service, no fuss.

Located not far away from Orchard Road, Bong Tong Kee is in a neighbourhood of several restaurants. It cost about S$6 to get there from my hotel on Orchard Road.I visited late in the night at around 10:30pm and there were not so many customers there. Ordered half chicken, a chicken oil rice, and a shrimp-on-toast. Guess what, the half chicken cost S$13 but the 4 pieces of shrimp toast cost S$20. The chicken is one of the best Hainanese chicken I have tried, very tender, and taste is just right. There is not too much fat under the chicken skin. Portion is quite big. Rice costs extra S$0.8.The expensive shrimp on the toast did not let me down, very fresh and taste good. It comes with very light tasted wasabi mustard dressing. This restaurant adds 10% service charge to the bill. When we took the taxi leaving from the restaurant, all the surcharge added up to almost 100% of the taxi fare.Not a very cheap restaurant, but it provides good environment and good quality food. Worth at least a try

Been here a couple of times and this place never struck me as "expensive" so I'm a little surprised by the sticker shock some reviewers have written aboutFor a weekend lunch, come at 12 or before. There's a long line forming from 1230. Also there's no parking space. This place is a lot smaller than the branch at balestierWe ordered a whole chicken and it was only $25. Don't know how some foreigners claimed to have paid a much higher price. Ordered other dishes like fried tofu, spicy kangkong etc. Admittedly, the small portion of the kangkong surprised me, but it's a small matter, no pun intendedAll in all, another pleasant experienc

If the food is going to be this price ... It needs to be good. This is only ordinary. And the peanuts cost extra and the wet towel costs extra and the Zion Rd food centre is just around the corner - go there instead! I forgot to mention bring a microscope to help find the salted fish. Service is friendly

We visited the restaurant on Sunday in the late afternoon. There were not many people and therefore the staff could spend more time to serve us. It would be better if the restaurant is bigger. We ordered chicken rice and deep fried beancurd. The chickens were tender and smooth, even my parents about 70 could also eat. The portion was good enough for one person. The chicken rice was fit with our expectation. What was unexpected was the deep fried beancurd which was crispy outside and soft inside, it was delicious to eat with the green sauce that they mixed on their own. The staff were nice. In addition to the chicken rice, we recommended the deep fried beancurd

It was good chicken rice but what got my jaw dropping was the price tag when I got the bill.  I dined there on 15 June and didn't expect that they would charge me for the hand wipes,the peanuts... stuff I didn't ask for. I paid $68 for 1 whole steam chicken, 5 plates of rice and 4 lime juice at $2.50 each. Most expensive chicken rice ever in my book...My fault for not checking the price but who would expect chicken rice could cost that much!!!??I pay half the price for as good chicken rice here in Sydney. What happened to the old Boon Tong Kee ? First visit in 10 years and I won't return again unfortunately. I may have arrived trying to reminisce old times. I will join the long line of people queuing for the best chicken rice at the market not far from this store next time I return to Singapore

Ordered half chicken and 2 servings of chicken rice. Chicken was extremely tender and smooth. The menu also boost a range of selection that I was not able to sample as there was only 2 of us.Location of this restaurant though was not close to any MRT station but can be reached via a 10 minute taxi ride from Orchard Road.Certainly recommended if you would like authentic chicken rice but also a nice place to sit other than a Hawker Centr

Came here to try their infamous chicken. Ordered half $13 and rice is extra charge. Beware of the boiled peanuts they put on your table for they charge you and also the wet towels also are not complimentary.Maybe take out would be better rather than dine in. Chicken was ordinary tasting nothing outstanding

The food here is very good, but I almost choked on the price of the scallop w/french beans ($23 SD)! That is a bit much. They also charge you for every little thing here. When you sit down, they bring you pickled peanuts ($2 appetizer), and wet naps ($.30 each) without asking and you are charged for them. Tap water is $.50 each as well. I would rather it just be included in the price and not show up as all these little items on the bill. As I mentioned, the food is good, but I would rather go to a hawker station the next time
