The pastries at Bread and Hearth are to die for. Highly recommend the cherry pastry. The coffee is good too.
5
Love the coffee and delicious pastries! Wonderful service too. Conveniently located along keong saik, definitely a cool and relaxing place to hangout and grab afternoon tea.
4
Tiny shop yet has everything you need for a quick and relaxing breakfast. Sandwiches, baked goods, fresh orange juice, tees, coffee. Simple location, good food, good coffee. Definitely recommend.

I loved the breakfast i had here. They did a tie up with Hotel Naumi, and the breakfast was 2 breads and a hot coffee or tea. Very satisfying.
4
I dropped in to kill an hour between meetings. Pleasant staff, good selection of cakes/pastry and coffee was good.
I liked it.
It was near empty at 215pm.
Worth a stop by.
5
Friendly people, nice atmosphere and lovely food. Perfect for breakfast, lunch or a snack. Went back several times.
4
Nothing beats the freshly baked bread! Love the croissant and matcha latte. Went twice in a week and tried the pasta for lunch. Surprisingly me and my friend like it too. Overall, is worth going.
4
I work around the area, and I love swinging by when I crave for soup or bread. Helps that the staff are super friendly.The soup-of-the-day comes with two slices of perfectly toasted bread. Great if you wanna have something light for lunch. It sells pretty fast, so be there before 4pm if you wanna try the soup.The pastries are not so great when you leave them overnight till morning as breakfast. But they are awesome when you have them on the spot, toasted and all!I love the Nutella brownie, and my husband finds the scone unique too.Note that the tables and chairs are quite tiny, and the seating space is quite cramp. Not recommended for large groups (of more than 4)

Was here on a Saturday noon time, ain’t too crowded. They bake their own bread here! Came specially for croissant and it turned out to be great! Must order them together with coffee. The sandwiches was remarkable. This was being made upon order and it’s served hot. Do drop by if you are round the corner!
5
This little gem was included in our hotel deal at the Naumi Liora. It is small and friendly with a large choice of breads and pastries. The orange juice is produced when you order so couldn't get any fresher. The salted peanut rolls were so good I bought some extra for the journey home
4
This is a nice cosy place away from the traffic and the city noise, to meet friends for a drink or a simple meal. Food is average but ambience is good. But can be crowded during lunch time.
5
You get the best breakfast in chinatown. And maybe one of the best in Singapur. But the prise is a bit higher than it is usual for Chinatown.
4
We took our breakfast here two days in a row. The staff is nice and the food and coffee are very good. A must try is the raspberry croissant....mouth watering !
4
Located in Chinatown - this is a great little place to get a pretty good cup of coffee, a continental breakfast and good wifi. Ideal for catching up with events and e-mail over breakfast!
4
Lovely coffee and juices
Friendly staff
Breads and fine but Raisin Rolls a must have
I also liked the ambience
5
A nice little place to get quality coffee and pastry for breakfast on Keong Saik. I had a combo of sweet and savory pastry which is good
5
We stayed at hotel dorsett which where close by this café and ate breakfest here 3 Times. Never dissapointed dispite we tryed different things on the menu. They have a really good like scrambled egg/muss they used at some sandwiches, a must try!
4
I went here for breakfast during my stay at nearby Naumi Liora.During most of my trip I went for Asian breakfast, but at one point I had to get used to European ways again? So I followed the advice of the Naumi Liora staff and went here. Basically this is a good European style bakery, which is already a compliment. They offer a variety of sweet baked pieces, but also some very good looking breads (did not try) as well as complete warm breakfast dishes (did not try).I chose coffee (which was a bit on the expensive side) and two sweet pieces. The pain of chocolate could maybe use a bit more chocolate but was very good. The other piece was five star.Staff was very friendly and they made you feel very welcome
5
This quaint little place is perfect for a light breakfast made of some fresh bakes. Loved the croissant, the cream cheese and sesame roll and the strudel. It opens early at 8am and closes at 3. Do be sure to catch your evening coffee here. Add a dollar or two and it comes with your choice of pastry
5
Je suis français and I truly enjoyed the quality of breads. I had the signature breakfast and loved it, while it was slightly Long to come, it is definitely worth it. Very tasty, full of flavours, but nothing overpowering. The croissant taste made me feel I was back in France, sitting at a cafe in Paris.Honestly thank you for the great moment. Merci.
4
Excellent lunch spot or a place to pick up a coffee and croissant in the morning, always friendly staff and the ever changing specials make it a place to come back to on a regular basis.
5
We had tokens from our hotel for breakfast. The bread is made on the premises and there is a huge choice. Customer service was very good, and friendly . Prices are reasonable, and the orange juice was made on the spot, just the best.
5
Lovely artisinal bread and great coffee. Definitely a place to go for breakfast and afternoon coffee and cake. Inside seating is rather limited. Good place to while away sometime with a good cuppa .
5
It's a famous and popular Bakery Cafe in Singapore and it's using age-old bread making techniques where every Bread and Pastry are baked using Traditional European Methods and they are handcrafted artisan breads that's the Bakery Cafe's Signature style really it's awesome and one can enjoy an aromatic and scrumptious slice of bread.
1
I made a long trip to get some bread but they actually close at 6:30 in the evening not 9:30 or 8:3
4
As I am there quite often for lunch I must admit: the food is really yum. Especially the croissants are lovely. As for the bread: the smaller sourdough loaves or loaves with olives as well as the baguettes are really good and "European". The higher priced sourdough bread is unfortunately not that good (13 SGD/loaf). You need to eat that at the same day otherwise it is dry and does not taste nice anymore (I tried to keep it in the fridge....same result). That was a pity though due to the higher price.Anyway, if you need a coffee, a sandwich and/or sth sweet just go there. Really yum food inside the store. I would highly recommend it :

Needed a place to wait for an hour while my wife had a fscial/massage do popped in here for a drink and pastry.They have a wide choice of freshly made pastries and bread, including chocolate croissants, peanut butter bread and various puddings and tarts.I had a bottle of IBC rootbeer - pricey at $5.20 but one of the few places in Singapore where you can get this - and a basket of peanut butter bread. The bread was soft and chewy and was delicious, though I wish there was a little bit more peanut in there, though the walnut pieces were nice too.For,those who want something heavier, they also have pies and lunch sets etc.The tables and lights, with the edison bulbs, create a laidback vibe, especially with sofas dotted here and there, and there is also free wifi as well. So this is an excellent place to while away some time
4
This is a great place for continental breakfast. They do good coffee, and excellent croissants, and danish pastries. The range of breads and baguettes is also very tempting. Seating inside is limited though
5
I walk passed this place week ago and saw the Teddy bear face Latte on the poster in front of the cafe. I look around saw another picture of croissants. I couldn't stop myself to popped into this place. Even though I already had my lunch and coffee fixed from FIVE NINE & LUXE. THE Croissants and Pain Au chocolate looks so tempting to me. I bought it back home. The croissant was excellent, lots of layers , crispy outside and super soft inside. This must be one of the best croissant across Tiong Bahru Bakery and ABC. The Pain au chocolate was quite good. But it can't compare to plain croissant though. Is this place got an experienced Barista? Anyone know? They have special promotion for coffee + pastries for only 6$ which excellent deal for Singapore. But not really sure if it coffee good enough??? Staffs were very friendly and attentive on the date I visited.
5
We stopped after church on Sunday and I was hungry on my way walking to have lunch in Tanjong Pagar and my husband wanted to stop for a take-away coffee so I got freshly baked croissants and my husband got the praline (hazelnut filling). Overall, I like their croissants better than the Tiong Bahru Bakery one. It is smaller but also cheaper. I was lucky that when I bought it, it was still warm and it tasted really good. The outside is flaky but the inside is very smooth buttery taste. I wish I had bought 5-6 and stock up for the week.
5
Good coffee, croissants from heaven, great ambient. Well designed place with jazz music. A great pause for the morning
4
Really nice bakery and the coffee was lovely. We had 2 in quick succession they were that good!
Bread was lovely and it was perfect for a quick bite to eat to start the day. Would be a regular if I was local!
5
This little cafe serves the most amazing selection of bread, pastries and savoury bites. Very reasonably priced and within walking distance of the Hotel 1929 plus others in Chinatown.
5
Lovely nice cafe with all you need for breakie no matter where you comong from. Freshly squizzed orange juice, baked pastries, sandwiches, loveley coffee..
4
We were just walking around and found this little gem. The bake goods are decent, people are friendly, and it was quite clean.
2
Previous visits here have been ok. They're bread products are nornally quite well made. It's gone downhill lately. Staff can't be bothered getting up from their seat to make a coffee, they suddenly forget how to make an espresso machiatto. The bread for the sandwich tastes a bit stale and really dry ingredients. Total waste of money.
4
My second visit here in the last 6 months. All three of us who popped in for a quick coffee thought it would be great if this place were more accessible (we work in the raffles place area).The breads (proper sized loaves) and viennoisserie on display at the counter looked really good. One of us who had a craving for their raspberry croissant and it didn't disappoint.The coffees went down well too - medium bodied with low acidity. Just the way we like it. The constant stream of patrons told us this is probably a neighbourhood favourite. Highly recommended if you are in the Keong Saik Rd area
4
Staff was polite and kind by suggesting the almond croissant and explaining where the grains used for the coffee come from. The place is small, fits maximum 20 people but it's cozy, the music is good and the right volume. I liked it and would certainly come back
5
If you are staying in the area and feel like that western food feeling, head here to get your daily bread, proper coffee or a delicious pastry.I had an apple pastry which was done perfectly with a nice coffee to finish
5
Right in the trendy part of Chinatown, this artesian bakery makes fantastic French style pastries and baguettes. Fantastic coffee
5
Bread and Hearth became our breakfast café during our stay in Singapore. Tucked away on Keong Saik Road in Chinatown it's a little gem. Delicious sandwiches, pastries and fresh pressed orange juice. All the bread and pastries are baked on the premises. Well worth visiting.
5
I found this small café on a walk from my hotel and had breakfast there one day and I liked it that much that I brought my family there the following day.
4
As I fail to understand the penchance of some of my countrymen to consistently patronise a certain pricey, overrated local bakery chain, I shall continue to get my weekly morning treat from Bread and Hearth. I won't tell you anything - come and do yourself a favour. And say you won't visit B***d T**k again
3
Sadly it's pretty average as an artisan bakery. The Croque Monsieur was OK, but nothing to rave about. The flat white coffee - utterly forgettable. Sad, because they've put a lot of effort into making a nice environment and could be a lot better.They'll bring your food over to the table, but then you have to go to the back of the space to fetch your own cutlery - which seems a little half-hearted with service.Unlikely to bother trying it again
3
Came here based on TripAdvisor for a quick breakfast as it had been give just one '£' sign. I would say two '££' would be fairer.In fairness the bread and the croissants were very nice. Staff were efficient, but we were the only people inside at the time.Coffee was quite small, the only real disappointment. Overall, good quality of food, but I think it warrants two '££' in terms of price, but this is Singapore
5
This little bakery was across from my hotel so gave it a try. Delicious fresh baked bred. I had one with pecans and cranberry, soft inside, crispy outside and also had a great cup of coffee with fresh squeezed orange juice. That's all I need for breakfast. They also have sandwiches for lunch
4
This small café was across the road from our hotel so we stopped in for morning coffee.They bake good pastries & bread on the premises & also do sandwiches & light lunches.It is very small, only 5 or 6 tables but we would certainly return as the offerings are good.It does not open early or we would have had our breakfast there
4
I go to this place for the past couple of months. Good for your croissants or various breads on the go. At peak hours in the morning you should not be in a hurry, as they take their time. This should be improved. But their coffees are good. I believe there is lots of changes in the girls at the counter, as I always have to explain to make the expresso a little longer, as it is really strong. To have the expresso cup filled up to 3/4 should do the job, but it seems that it is impossible to get that in their minds.Other than that it is a good place
5
This quaint, little café in Chinatown has truly wonderful pastries and breads! I've been here several times for lunch and for a snack/dessert, and leave satisfied each time. The staff are very cheerful and bubbly (even at 8AM!), the variety of pastries stretches through 3 display windows and although the café itself is quite small, it's nice and cosy. Some recommended items include: praline croissant, croque monsieur, vegetable focaccia, pecan cranberries bun, almond croissant and cinnamon bun. The last being my favourite! It has just the right amount of cinnamon in its filling and the amount of cream cheese frosting is perfect to compliment the bun and not overpower it. Ask for it (or any pastry/bread you order) to be heated up and enjoy a delicious treat! They also serve up sandwiches at lunch, my favourite being the jambon fromage sandwich. You can ask for it to be toasted or served cold, but this is best served warm, as it allows the cheese to melt on the bread. I liked that they prepared the sandwiches to order, so you know that they're fresh every time and haven't been sitting in the display window for some time. Definitely a bakery/café I would recommend and have been coming back to often. It's also located on a lovely street, minutes away from Chinatown
4
Good surprise in the heart of Chinatown a nice bakery with good croissant and other " vienoiseries". Definitely a good address to stop by for a breakfast or a sandwich. I ll come agai
5
Good atmosphere, tasty sandwiches, and super croissants. Also coffee is very good.
This was our third week in Asia, so it was a perfect place for breakfast. Also it was just few steps from our hotel.
5
The Bread and Pastries here are some of the best, great location in Chinatown i will defiantly visit again.
5
Came here for breakfast every morning with the family whilst in Singapore and enjoyed every meal, great coffee and yummy food, friendly good service and a great relaxing way to start the day.

Dropped by for breakfast while gallivanting at the Southern Ridges. Sat morning, took a while to find: hint..look for the yellow stools... But in Chinatown, tucked away in a nostalgic street redolent of old times, a hop away from Outram MRT. Staff were friendly, pastries and bread delectably displayed behind counter. Not a huge seating area but cosy all the same. Had expresso and sesame cheese pastry, and bought some other pastries to bring home for lunch. In a word, this is good baking. A far cry from the margarined stuff you get elsewhere. Worth traveling 12 km for my dough fix? Hmm. Perhaps. But if you're closer, do go. Have an extra bun on my behalf....
4
Decided to visit for a snack. Ordered a Flat White and a chocolate scone. Scone was warmed and served. Butter was offered and served together. Scone was quite good. Coffee was just decent and perhaps not really worth the price tag
4
I don't know what the deal is with the pastries in Singapore. They are super delicious! I think I'm just used to eating sweets from the USA and thinking to myself, "Dang, that's really sweet!" I noticed that the desserts/pastries in Singapore use less sugar (which is great!).I stumbled upon Bread and Hearth while my husband and I were looking for a specific breakfast place. We just decided to go here. It was good! I got a ham croissant and freshly squeezed OJ, and my husband got a breakfast platter with an Americano. The sandwich was just OK. The OJ would've been better if it had a little ice in there. The pastries were wonderful. I got a chocolate chip scone, and it was the best one I ever had. Very fluffy with the right amount of chips. My husband got the blueberry tart, which was also delish and tart. Overall, this place was good! Staff was friendly; prices were decent
4
Excellent coffee and a good selection of both savoury and sweet artisan breads. Great for a coffee break, snacks or for a light lunch.The service is attentive and pleasant but a little slow. Their processes seem more complex than they need be
4
Breakfasts in Singapore can be grand 5 star hotel affairs or a bit hit and miss.Next to Hotel 1929 when I stay, I found this wonderful artisanal bakery serving excellent pastries and bread, very good coffee and service with a smile.My coffee was dark, rich and full of flavour.My croissant was rich, buttery and so crispy.The small salmon and leek tart was simple scrumptious.Highly recommended
5
Its not just bread you'll be eating, its a whole new world that of sensation that you'll be experiencing when you bite into any one of their exquisitely done creations
3
I had takeaway so can't really comment on the service. Prices of pastries and breads here are slightly cheaper than some of the high-end bakeries in the city but taste is just as good, which makes them good value. Will probably be back again
4
Good coffee or tea!
Great taste for bread or pasties!
We love it! Will come back again when visit Singapore. Lucky me, 10% discount for dine in coz we stayed at Dorsett Singapore Hotel.
5
Some of the best coffee I've had in Singapore and some very tasty pastries. A great breakfast option if you're staying in the Keong Saik Rd area. Highly recommended.
4
Finally!! A decent cappuccino!!! Not a litre of frothy milk with a hint of coffee but one made like it should be!!
3
First the good bits - the raspberry croissant was excellent (more like a pastry than a croissant), bacon sandwich very tasty and the toasted ciabatta with olive oil and balsamic vinegar very unexpected in a cafe but also good. However, the service didn't match. My bacon sandwich was forgotten, I had to ask for it again by which time my partner had finished her food so I was eating alone. When it eventually arrived it was cold which is inexcusable after such a long wait. Tables were not cleared very frequently, meaning new customers had to sit down to dirty tables.Finally, on paying I was informed that as they had run out of small notes they would have to give me a large pile of coins. This was fine except what the waitress did not tell me was that she had insufficient coins in the till and so shortchanged me.So, the experience of good pastries and coffee was undone by the poor service of one waitress (the boy however was very friendly and good)
3
I had breakfast here one morning at 9:10am whilst staying across the road at the 'Naumi Liora Hotel' and the selection of fresh baked bread, pastries and tarts was awesome. I had the 'Bacon & Spinach Quiche' (warmed) and it was delicious (10/10 score). I also had a hot Latte and that also was pretty good (8/10 score) but it took 13 minutes for it to be bought to me. Now for a small CafÃ© with not more than about 20 tables (and about 4 people in front of me) that is totally unacceptable. So sadly speed of service gets a 1/10 score which is why I only rate my review as 'Average' even though the quality of the food was excellent. Even though snail slow all of the staff (of which there were 3) were all friendly and polite.Keong Saik Road has a great old colonial feel to it whilst it has a backdrop of modern highrise buildings. There are a few tables outside 'Bread & Hearth' so you can take in the city view while you enjoy your fare. Also on the same street just a 2 minute walk away is an interesting Hindu temple (Sri Layan Sithi Vinayagar Temple) that is worth a visit whilst in the area
2
I assure that with no doubt, their pastries live up to the hype. It's really that good.It's the service that doesn't. Some days they are good enough. Some days are just pretty bad. 5 stars for pastries.3 stars for coffee.1 star for service.Luckily their pastries are worth the price
4
Very nice croissants in a nice environment. Croissant might have been too buttery for some whose cultural foods are quite as rich though and pain de chocolat was little light on chocolate. Selection of pastries was not what you might find in France but what they did have looked great and what I had tasted very good. Another indication of potential quality and authenticity was the number of actual French people (or French speakers) leading one to believe it has a taste of the old country.Definitely worth a visit for a casual breakfast in an interesting area of Singapore
5
My wife and I were looking for somewhere to eat after church service on a recent Sunday and found this wonderful place. Excellent baked goods -- flaky and fresh and all you hope they will be when you see them behind the glass. We tried as many different ones as our appetite would allow. All good, as was the friendly service. We finished with decaff coffee -- which you can't find in very many shops. Worth going out of your way to enjoy. You'll go back again
5
This is a small, well decorated cafe with really nice coffee and pastries. I wouldn't recommend if you want to sit and relax in here as the seatings are not made for that. I don't care. I just need good coffee and small bites when I look for these kind of places.
4
Having been back from Paris 3 months ago, I was eager to try out any bakery outlet that sells bread/ pastries that were made with ingredients imported from City of lights. After reading the review from Straits Times, I went down to check out this place & it doesn't disappoint!The bread quality has that similarity to French bread we eaten in Paris (it does taste different, mind u!). We love the wholemeal sandwich loaf, Pain de mie, chassons au pomme, pain aux tomates, matcha orange, pineapple & fig roll. We practically bought most of the stuff for our BF for next couple of days!Highly recommended & hope they keep up the quality
