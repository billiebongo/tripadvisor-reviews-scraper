Hidden away from the main restaurants of Robertson Quay, this Japanese eatery serves their signature ramen with a lot of unique ingredients and condiments. Soup is flavourful and best part is the generous serving of greens they include. Be prepared to sit outdoors when it is crowded. Though very reasonably priced, their portions are too large for most ladies and often a waste of such delicious ramen
