Excellent bartenders with incredible mixology skills. Really enjoyed their creations. Usually I let them surprise with something new and they never failed me.
5
I go there frequently. The cocktails are very good, the bartenders profesional, the crowd tends to be engaging and interesting. I like it on Fridays after work.

Slipped in here on a friend's recommendation in the late evening for great cocktails and a relaxed environment.

Tip top bartenders, great atmosphere, funky music and cosy experience all in all. If you are in the neighborhood swing by

Great place to go for a drink and just unwind, good service and a great drinks menu. Sit outside and just enjoy the atmosphere. I will be back.

Love the cocktails. Recommendations from the bartender were great. Will come here next time I'm in town for sure.
Was a little quiet but nice and it was a Wednesday.
5
Cocktail heaven concocted by impressive bartenders witch swanky attitudes. Great vibes and unpretentious drinks. Cufflink is def. a favourite among my friends and I.
5
I happen to see that this bar has a very nice atmosphere so I decided to pop in and try out. It's dim but classy. The bartenders were pretty friendly and they know their drinks well. I would come back for more, definitely for sure

Went for cocktails on two occasions as our hotel was just around the corner and loved this place. The staff was super friendly and so fun, pouring shots every now and then and joining us to have them, too. They were very attentive and fast. Drinks were amazing and we will for sure be back on our next visit

Great Negroni cocktail... What else?!?Since I'm Italian, I like Negroni cocktail and here you can get a real good one.The place is just located in Chinatown, on the side of many cocktail bars, nice people, nice ambient.No question, you will have good time there....
5
We went here for a friends birthday and it was really great, chilled cocktail bar. They had a great mix of various cocktails and the staff were very friendly and helpful. Overall a great night and great drinks!
5
Its located just off Keong Saik road, one of the best streets for food and night life in Singapore. Good atmosphere and crowd. Perfect for an after dinner club experience.
5
Very eccentric names for drinks but the ones I tried were quite interesting. Good cocktail menu and comfortable furnishings.
4
Its pricey however the cocktails are the best. the best drink I have had in a long time. The staff is very polite and helpful
5
...But that is the BEST cocktail I've ever had! Pricey, yes, but hands down, the best drink ever! Cheers to whomever created that!
4
Great crowd and fun place to hangout with friends. Opens from 4 or so till late. Drinks were okay, nothing out of the ordinary. Abit pricey though. Overall would go back again if i'm around that area next time i'm there in SG.

cool bar, great cocktails, no view but generally a good atmosphere, nice people in and out, have fun here that's what cocktails are for

I personally haven't been to many cocktail bars but if theres one place I really loved being to was Cufflink Club. Its a neat little establishment with a classy decor and full of expats of Singapore on most days. The bartenders are thorough professionals and suggest you some great mixes when you are confused.They have a huge bar,limited drinks on the menu but would definitely stir up something on request.Had one of their premium cocktails called 'Jack the Ripper' and it was pretty cool
5
This is my second time back at The Cufflink Club to celebrate the start of the Singapore Cocktail Week 2016. The first time was all for the cocktails, as most of you would have read from the reviews. I tried the pizza on my second return (because they only serve pizza for food) and I couldn't keep my mouth off it! Possibly the best pizza in town if you are those who prefer soft, thin crusts. I am definitely going back for more!! For the ladies, did I forget to mention that there were a couple of cute guys working there as well? Triple win situation. :

We enjoyed a few drinks in this bar over two nights of our trip to Singapore, as it was a short walk from our hotel. The cocktail menu is original and intriguing, steering clear of the usual mundane and predictable blends - definately worth a try for enthusiasts.The staff were very friendly and we spent many hours drinking and chatting about their lifestyles and what it's like to live in Singapore. By chance, one of the bar staff used to live around the corner from us back in the UK - it's a small world
5
True cocktail bar where the bartenders know their craft. Ask them anything, they'll make your palate explode.
5
tasteful interior, friendly staff, innovative menu, great soundtrack..
the place has it all..of course this doesn't come for free which is the only downside but i guess thats life..
try the kraken rum old fashioned..
5
Good place to stop for a pre-dinner cocktail with an extensive list of innovative beverages. Excellent gin & tonic range....
5
Great cocktails & a great atmosphere. A great place to start on your night out & also a great place for a drink after dinner.
4
Very nice bar ! Awesome cocktails ! The variety if tequila was great !! We had a really nice evening ! The staff is friendly and the service is great.
5
Well, it could just because it is a weekend, but this place does give a boom for weekend! Keep it up!

Friendly staff and lovely interior for a hang-out place in Chinatown area. However, the cocktails are just above average but are prices way over the top. In fact most of the cocktails here cost more than what the same/ similar would cost event at Ku De Ta (ce la vie) at MBS

I was there on a Monday night which admittedly is not the best day of the week to check out pub credentials! But with a couple of friends, late evening running past 12 midnight, it was a happy place to be for conversations and some drinks! Not too much a cocktails person, I was talked into trying Jaick the Ripper and I don't regret it one bit!! The Blue & Green Cheese Pizza was first rate too and the service very warm, sometimes talkative but never intrusive. Am sure they play different genres of music through the week but on monday when I was there, it was more house and that too not very loud. I like the interiors as well. Black n beige with not too much colour thrown in. All in all, surely recommend the place

first went a few years ago, interesting cocktails, good service, and buzzing atmosphere... a repeat visitor when Nick was on the staff, someone I'd worked with who left his budding finance career to become a mixologist here, always found us a table, and ensured excellent service! wish him well with his latest adventure, and am sure Cufflinks won't be the same without him, but look forward to going back to this bar
5
We felt so Good that we could not leave ...the Porn star followed by Berlusconi , don't get me wrong they are the creations of Cufflink Club ( check out their Website )...Excellent well trained Team , great design and music . A real cocktail bar to unwind after a busy day . We ordered to 2 home made pizza , a real delight . Will definitively be back when next in Singapore
2
The venue attempts to resemble a serene hipster vibe but in truth simulates a sub standard watering hole...
The 'mixologists' (I use that term loosely in this instant) are clueless or just plain spaced out and the cocktails are tedious and drab...
4
Great place to go after a great meal for continued drinking until the early hours of your choice of cocktails and wines. Good buzzy atmosphere and everyone having a great time, including the bar staff. Highly recommended.
4
We went there with a few mates and had a good time standing outside on the street. The crowd was relaxed and the vibe was cool.
Four Peroni were SGD51, which is a OK price.
5
My best bar in Singapore !!
Use to go for some warm up drinks before clubbing
Bartenders are very friendly and experienced
4
I was here with a friend for pre-dinner drinks in celebration for her birthday.. Really enjoyed ourselves here! Great ambience, creative cocktails, just that it's quiet because it's a Monday night and the bartender mentioned it is more common for post dinner drink on this day. Had a lot of fun with the little creativity was here and there... Come and experience cocktails at a different level
4
An early visit to this edgy area only a few 100 yards from the hub of Chinatown proper,to get a pre-meal drink,and we happened upon this trendy bar owned by 2 expat Brits. One of them,Joel,was on duty and gave us his local and personal lowdown,so that added to the general buzz that whole bar area is mixing in........and when M's usual G & T arrives, it is from Berlin,whilst the exotic tonic was local,all giving that die hard old drink a new vibe.....mmmm. My martini excellent also.

The Buy Me A Drink App team does most work meetings on the go and all of them are at bars so we love it when we find the perfect spot to mix work with pleasure. We spent a few hours last night at The Cufflink Club and we simply loved the vibe! Drinks are wonderful here our favourites are I love NYC and 50 shades but the bartenders are also really good at creating cocktails to your taste. We usually ask for vodka based and not sweet! The staff is amazing, really nice, really professional and fun to have a chat with. So if you are in Singapore for business and you are looking for a cool party spot to entertain colleagues or clients this is a great option.

The range and selections of spirits is great and it does feel like being in an exclusivr club but somehow or other it doesn't quite deliver the experience the look makes you think it will.Service is so so and pricing is at the high en

So my friends and I walk in at 2am to meet some other friends who were here. After a long night of drinks and dinner at 2 am I wasnt really in the mood for a tough drink. So I asked the Bartender to pour me Baileys on ice. The response I got, "Sorry, we're not that kind of bar." Firstly, what does that even mean? Secondly, you are a bartender- in the customer SERVICE business- its your job to be polite. So I ignored the rude remark, and asked "What liqueurs do you have?" To which he pointed behind him. That's it- no reply just a hand signal. THAT's essentially what this place is about. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT. TERRIBLE ATTITUDE. This didnt happen to me only. My friend asked for something else and came back saying the guy told her ''we're not that kinda bar"!! Seriously. What kind of bar are you if you cant recommend when a customer asks you what you have to serve? They call themselves mixologists, but these guys are just glorified rum and coke servers. I ended up not drinking anything. Message to the management- A bar is ambience, attitude, vibe and drinks. The customers add to the ambience & vibe- if you can't fix your attitude, there aint gonna be no customers and no drinks. Message to other customers - I highly recommend going to Lime House right next to it or Lucha Loco for stellar drinks, superb vibe and excellent customer service

We went mid week for a few cocktails and really enjoyed the location, style and vibe of the bar. They have some very original drinks all served uniquely with a special twist like 'boys with their toys' that had a toy soldier inside an ice cube. The waitress was awesome and is the reason we drank another 3 cocktails and got to look at the impressive gin selection. Only downer was the food. We had a charcuterie board which had some cold roast beef plus two chopped up small fatty salamis and three bits of bread which took twenty mins to prepare. The food did not match the innovation or style of the drinks. So next time i'll just stick with great cocktails and enjoy the good stuff!

Upmarket bar with upmarket clientele . Very good service. Servers coming to table frequently to ask if more aaas required . Cocktail very good.
4
Food was good but the drinks were just outstanding! Especially the one in the jars with cinnamon, unique combination but well thought through and executed, looking forward to going back!

There is nothing wrong with this place. It is nice. the staff was very pleasant and helpful, location is good near several restaurants and located in a reconverted shophouse. it's just not extra exciting, but it is a solid value!

On a balmy Monday night, my local friend suggested we meet for pre-dinner cocktails at The Cufflink Club.As it was less than a 3 minute walk from my hotel (Hotel 1929) in Chinatown, I said done, see you there!It was a classic rennovated chic modern bar in hipster downtown Chinatown.A few outdoor seats welcomed you into the cool, darkened interior.One bar dominated a wall, with comfy chairs and high table stools to select. Some eclectic artwork adorned the walls.The staff were young and engaging.My Hendrinks martini, very dry, was beautifully made while my local friend enjoyed a crushed ice G&T.A great spot with groovy music, just right for slightly loud conversation and a fabulous start to an evening

1am at the Jiak Chuan road - best club on this road - music not too loud - good crowd - great drinks - try the cafe patron chilled shots - and also the spring break with a ping pong ball ! recommended for a night out of pub hopping

Singapore's version of London's Callooh Callay? Similar sort of atmosphere and equally inventive and fun cocktails.We only had a couple of drinks fairly late on a Friday night so it was full of locals enjoying a night out at the end of the week but despite that the service was attentive and polite.Fun note for fellow Brits, I was amused to hear the Alan Partridge audiobook playing in the gents

Forget the Singapore Sling and the mass-produced tourist stuff. Try the slightly obscene cocktail made with homemade earl-Grey-infused gin at the Cufflink club. The service is charming and attentive, and they serve up top-quality mixology. I am glad that I bothered to make my way to this back street in Chinatown. Good place for drinks before dinner, keep in mind that they don't serve much to eat
5
When you have been to Singapore many times, means you are not having mega liters of Singapore Sling. You rather want to have the cocktail you like to drink in any part of the world. At this very moment I'm testing bars with my favorite Oldfashioned. And it is damn good here
5
Although I can't remember the full name (the something Hipster?) this is the best drink I've had in Singapore. They are tasty and strong but not overpowering. Sometimes at these fancy drink bars it feels like the concept of a drink is more important than the taste but this is definitely not a problem at the Cufflink. We are big fans and will be back soon

A friend of mine knew the owner and we decided to visit to check out the place. The location is in really nice part of Chinatown. There are a few hip restaurants and hotels around here and on the weekends its quite busy. We came in on Monday night so it was quite. Everyone was very attentive and i directly opened the drink list. There are only 12 items in the center page. These are the cocktails that they are pushing. According to owner they change the menu every once in a while.I tried 2 items and they were both very very good. One was called the Spring breaker (if I'm not mistaken). It was a tequila based cocktail and it was smooth. I totally forgot the name of the other one but it was as good. Certainly worth a try. I drove by this place on the weekend and saw a really good crowd spilling to the street for a smoke. Prices are not cheap for these cocktails but they are worth it. To tell you the truth i didn't really look at the prices for the other items, but I do suggest this place if you looking for the expat crowd of Singapore. Music was top40 when I was there don't know what they play on weekends.Cheer
