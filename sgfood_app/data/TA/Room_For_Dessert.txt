very good atmosphere, good service with some other suggestion of the waiter. the value is ok but if you check about some other place you can have better value but I definitely come back there because they really care about the customer.

Their Moist, nutty, creamy carrot cake is really something. Must try!

I have been visiting Room for Dessert on and off for the last 2 years. Each time I visit, I was floored by the owner's good customer service and her humbleness. My favourite cake is the red velvet cake, but I have tried other cakes as well and they are also very good. Despite its not-so-friendly location, I would go out of my way for this little cozy bakery. However, there isn't much space to sit around. Suggest to buy and eat elsewhere. Oh yes, don't bother with the coffee though

We had a slice of the passionfruit cheesecake and carrot cake. I love the way the tartness of the passionfruit on top combines with the cheesecake below. Its a unique blend which is refreshing and leaves a nice sensation in your mouth. We sat down and had coffee too. The atmosphere is relaxing as the shop faces a lovely green park in front. Good place to go to to chill out

I was looking for a place to buy some carrot cake in Singapore for my high tea home party. After googling for the place, I found Room for dessert. I gave it a try and was really impressed by taste, quality and service too. Carrot cake is definitely my number one. With plenty of raisins, walnuts and of course, carrot. I also tried their chocolate banana mascarpone cheesecake, yet another treasure! With a rich chocolate layer it is a perfect dessert for "sweet tooths" like myself who love to indulge and let chocolate slowly melt in mouth
