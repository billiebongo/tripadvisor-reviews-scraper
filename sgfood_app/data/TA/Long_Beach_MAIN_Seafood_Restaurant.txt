The foods are very good and my recommendation is black pepper crab. Seafoods also nice to eat.
But come to service, not so good and slow. The crowd not so much.
Still can come but service ñot good. Foods still can eat.
5
Here lies the best black pepper crab ever so good you will be licking off the shells. Good sides is a the sambal kangkong and stuffed dough fritters
5
Amazing food and service. Black pepper Crab just delicious but not only, Cereal Prawns, sea food fried rice are so good!
Best location in Singapore..
This is a must..

These kind of restaurants should not be supported. They kill innocent and critically important animals of our oceans. Not supporting them would hopefully change their attitude to critically endangered sharks and fish.

We're Europeans and we were brought here by a Singaporean friend who know the place. They were all locals, and the restaurant was full, we got the last table but it's better to book in advance! He ordered chilli crab, black pepper crab, some beautiful prawns, some noodles with prawns & some beef with veggies. All the food came quite quickly and all was fantastic, tasty and delicious! Pepper crab is quite spicy, be careful! But it's worth a try. We don't know how much it was the bill as he didn't let us pay, but I think high quality high bill

Having lived in Singapore for 3 years some time ago, I should have smelled the rat. They very cleverly avoided giving me a price for a small pepper crab -“ seasonal price ” came to a ripoff $80 for max 500 g crab they claimed was 1 kg (!!!) with very little meat, until after the meal. A light meal for two came to $140 - my most expensive meal in Singapore - EVER - and I left hungry and annoyed while they smiled serenely. These people are sharks - you have been warned
4
Definitely worth trying - very good sea food: e.g. deep fried octopus, drunken prawns, grouper etc. Ask for some chilli oil to bring out the flavours (or drown them if over-enthusiastic). Seating outside is very pleasant in the evenings at this time of year (January). Did not find the service pushy (cf another reviewer): just friendly and efficient. And not too efficient

Historical restaurant in Singapore, the one attributed to the invention of Black Pepper Crab. Location is relatively far away from downtown but the place is definitely worth a visit. Tried both the black pepper and chilly crab together with a few sides. Everything was excellent and in great quantity. Location is comfy and often pretty crowded. Prices are relatively high. Definitely worth a visit

Over the last 15 years I've been to Singapore 4 times. Each time I've been fortunate to go to Long Beach. The food is wonderful (Black Pepper Crab, Chilli Crab, Razor Clams, all sorts of lovely fish) and the staff are fantastic. For me, any trip to Singapore is not complete without a visit to Long Beach). Anyone who goes to Singapore should go
3
I usually go to Long Beach for seafood with overseas visitor because we can enjoy decent quality food with views. The new twist to the most recent visit is the attempt by the restaurant to upsell its crab dishes. The waitress claimed that local Sri Lankan crabs are small and recommended Alaskan crabs. She also tried to push Australian lobsters. A very annoying practice as most of the customers are here to enjoy “local” seafood
5
Great variety of ocean crabs and lobsters, and fish. Unless you care about crabs and lobsters who are being cooked alive you will enjoy delicious meals. The service is superb. The place is very trendy and crowded on weekends, beter try on weekdays.
4
Nice restaurant and delicious food. The only problem is, not easy to get taxi. Service was good, very friendly and always smiling to everybody.
4
Plenty of choices at East coast center. Long Beach was good and good service.
Black pepper crab was 5 stars
Lala/mini clams were 5 stars
Scallops were 4 stars
Prawns with salted egg 4 stars
Overall the experience was good! Served fast.

Our family came here almost 16 years ago when my son was three years old. Fast forward to November 2017 and we are back here again. My son is 18 years old and nothing has changed. The Restaurant claims that it indeed invented Black Pepper Crabs and boy is it tasty. Memories came flooding back and we ate like no tomorrow. Basically we ordered Singapore Chilli Crab, Black Pepper Crab, Fried Anchovies fried rice, Sambal Sotong and Kang Kong. The crabs we ate are sourced from Negombo, Sri Lanka. Being of Sri Lankan birth I am well aware that the majority of the large mud crabs are exported to Singapore on a massive scale leaving very little to the local population. Singapore pay big bucks for them and this is reflected in the price per kilo we had to pay. We got charged 80 dollars a kilo. That is expensive and is probably indicative of current seafood prices worldwide. Eating seafood is an expensive affair and Long Beach Seafood Restaurant has reflected this in their pricing. Food wise can not fault one dish. Meaty Crabs are a messy eating affair and the Restaurant caters for this providing tea scented finger bowls. All up I love this Restaurant. I just wish it was a little cheaper but having said that it was almost 15 years ago when we were last here. We give it a thumbs up
5
I am sure people have their favorite place to eat chili crab, but this is the only exposure I had to it... and it was HEAVENLY. I especially love the bread they provide you with so you can scoop up the sauce while they prep the crab for you (optional). You can pry the meat out yourself or you can have the experts do it for you. Easily the best meal from my trip in Singapore
4
We were on our way home to Australia. We had a 4-hour layover in Singapore. We decided to make run for a meal, so we went straight through passport control and into a taxi. 15 minutes later, we were seated at Long Beach. We were given a lovely indoor table overlooking the water. Quite relaxing.The staff person suggested we do not order a whole fish as we had a time issue, so instead we ordered prawns as well as egg rice. Washed down with a beer, it was a great way to unwind before our next flight.We ate well and were back at the airport approx. one hour after leaving

Visited Long Beach for the very first time recently as LGF had cravings for chilli crab. Long Beach is situated along the East Coast Parkway together with the likes of Jumbo Seafood and Ubin Seafood restaurants etc. Itâ€™s somewhat a seafood village so you can take your pick from the handful of mega seafood restaurants there. Ordered the chilli crab although apparently they invented and have the best pepper crab. The crab was 1.1kg which is a decent size. Also had the Baram prawns which were stir fried with chilli, a salt and pepper squid and a vegetable dish. Food was generally pretty good and although LGF liked the chilli crab with little mantau buns, my favourite was actually the prawns. But were allowed to like different things or so she says lolAnyway, if you have not tried the food at Long Beach, do give it a go. Food is pricey here about $85-95 per pax but you get good quality seafood. Service was okay but the food does arrive very quickly which means the restaurant has ample kitchen staff. Love not having to wait for food to be served. I would recommend the outdoor seats where you get the sea breeze.
5
Beautiful place to have dinner with chilli & pepper crab on my mind. With a light breeze blowing from the sea it was truly an amazing place to end our last stay in Singapore. The dessert presentation was creative and yummy. You want regret eating there
3
Went here with some friends and their kids for a feast before heading to the airport to go home. The chili crab was meaty and the sides flavorful. Some of the fried dishes were a bit overdone, but all in all a satisfying meal. They were busy, so we had issues getting our wine, etc at times. We were able to flag down servers when needed. Having the live crab there to see, especially with the kids, was great
4
Great spot to sit looking at the sea and the tankers while eating your chilli crab although they claim that their black pepper is the best. The service was great and attentive. The chilli crab was nice but not as firm as it is Sri Lankan crab. Nice spot to accompany your meal.
4
A colleague from
Singapore brought me here. The place is close to the seashore, very simple but nice. Typical seafood on the menu. Lot of choice. The crab is really tasty, quite spicy but ok for western standards.
Would recommend.
5
Celebrated mom's birthday here. We were all very satisfied with the food. Highly recommend their black pepper crab and traditional fried flat rice noodle! So so good!
5
The restaurant is nicely decorated and they cater a wide range of seafood which are fantastically cooked especially their chilli crabs.
5
We made reservations prior to arrival- we were 21pax total. We had the Sri Lankan crabs in 3 ways- chilli crab, salted egg and black pepper flavors. All were very tasty! I'm starting to like salted egg flavor this trip!
4
In a party of five we ordered from fresh oysters and prawns to chilli crab, from the live seaford tanks, and added stir fried vegetables and rice as a side.
Service, presentation, and flavor was exemplary.
Cannot fault.
4
Their specialty is the spicy crab and it was very good.
Excellent spicy dumplings
Decent salad rolls
Very good whole fried fish
Drunken prawn soup OK, but expected more
Hacked chicken very good
All washed down by a fair amount of Tiger beer

This was the third 'Chili Crab' location that my wife and I tried out. Jumbos was the first which, I was sort of more disappointed in after other options were tried. No Signboard was the second which was a great place and had really good White Pepper Crab. At this location, we tried the Black Pepper crab (their invention allegedly) and we found it to be our favorite.Of all the locations, this was probably the most "fancy". It had private enclosed dining rooms for VIPs and the main indoor dining area was very clean and new looking. There are some tables outdoor but it is adjacent to a busy street that might not be very appealing when dining. We were sat immediately although reservations are probably a prudent idea, especially if you have a large party.Crab wise, the Black Pepper Crab was our favorite. The crab was maybe slightly under 1 kilo so smaller than the other places we tried earlier - however this was my personal favorite. I would still say No Signboard managed the best/juciest crab but in all honesty I would eat at either location. That being said, Long Beach was the nicest of the places we went, the service was pretty good and the crab was really good - easily my favorite.The Brocooli we ordered was perfectly cooked.. probably par-boiled slightly and then cooked in the sauce. The flower portion was soft but not mushy and the stems had a perfect crunch. We tried a few other things and found the menu to be solid no matter what we tried.Like other locations, you will get nickeled and dimed for peanuts and napkins which is annoying but standard. Price wise, we felt this was the least expensive location or close to it - and being the nicest location it merits consideration. Like No Signboard - its not in as awesome a location as Jumbos but the area around Long Beach is better than No Signboard. Its an easy walk across the street from Mountbatten station (CC7, circle line) so getting there is just navigating the trains which is trivial.I would strongly recommend trying this place out. The Riverwalk is a hard place to *not* eat at because its just so convenient to many other attractions and after dinner strolls. However, the food and pricing at this restaurant merits the inconvenience of location and is far worth it IMHO. If you are entertaining for business - this is definitely a great location with the private VIP rooms and the restaurant seems expertly skilled at handling that type of business

My Favourite choice to bring oversea friends to savour one of the best Chilli crabs in Singapore. The Long Beach Seafood Restaurant @ UDMC has a beautiful view of our East Coast shoreline and witnesses the heavy traffic of our proud Changi Airport. The sauce of the Chilli crabs is Super distinctive from other seafood restaurants which u cannot resist helping yourself to a few buns to go with it.They provide good service and the price is reasonable for a 9 course set dinner for 10
5
Excellent restaurant. Great atmosphere. Best to book because very popular. Seafood Singapore style excellent. Recommend the prawns with garlic crumble and the famous black pepper crab. Wash basins handy in the restaurant area for frequent washing of hands during devouring the crab, which has to be eaten by hands. Tiger beer is good.
4
Had a dinner on Sunday Night for the first time in a couple of years. To eat we had chili chicken, sambal kangkong, seafood fried rice and prawns. The food was good but we forgot how popular it is to eat out here. Its super busy on weekends and as a result you need to book and have some patience with the service. Good valu
4
We ordered the black pepper crab, it's very good. They only had small ones this time.
We sat outside and it was dark already so with the good breeze was great.
Their vegetable fish are algo good. We'll be back
4
Very nice place Excellent sea food. I recommend this place in SG more than other places loxated in famous streets !🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
5
Basic seafood restaurant by the sea with good atmosphere and excellent food. The black pepper crab was the best I have ever tasted
2
I have been coming back for years and recently noticed that the food, especially the chili crab was lacking consistency. Less spicy, less flavor overall. Something's just missing and no longer the same. The other Long Beach outlets suffered the same years ago and unfortunately UDMC seems to have followed suit. Looks like I need to find an alternative.
5
We were lucky to be hosted by locals there who spoke Cantonese and was able to order so that we had a good experience. They had been there before and knew it was a good restaurant. This place is the originator of the black pepper crab, which was very good and inspired me to cook with more black pepper. Their chili crab was also very good and I think we all preferred it to the black pepper, though both were good. Also had the bamboo clam, which was also tasty. The atmosphere here was nice, on the Eastern Bay waterfront facing the port.
1
There was this one assistant manager who was very rude to our family. She yelled at us when se asked her what kind of fried rices are available and sighed when we asked for the total price of the items we ordered. Then she didnt even tell us how much they cost each but told us the price in total and yelled “OK Lah?!“. She seemed nice to other customer which I felt very discriminated. We ordered scallop white rice ($18) and there wasnt any scallop in it. What a rip off. Any tourist should avoid this place and go to Jumbo seafood located nextdoor instead
2
I have eaten here every time I visited Singapore, but this time was very disappointing...I ordered my usual chili crab and was expecting to bite into a big claw filled with firm tasty meat, but instead it was watery, limpy with hardly any meat in it, and the rest of the crab was the same.However, I have to say that the chili sauce or gravy was good as expected, and the steam fish and fry rice was decent as well
4
The white pepper grab is a wonder. 3 kg and a lot of flesh. Though a bit expensive but not taken by surprise as this was discussed before ordering. The rest of the food is very good in quality and quantity, prawns, Veggies and noodles.Great view sea Front

但我們抵達餐廳的時候已經將近11點，親切的店員很抱歉地告訴我們用餐時間只有一個小時，如果我們不介意的話再坐下用餐。食材真的很新鮮，即使弄的手油油髒髒的也要吃完、實在太美味了。店員阿姨的服務也很好很親切。如果有機會來新加坡吃黑胡椒螃蟹，建議你過來試試看。Arrived Singapore pretty late but eager to try the chilled/ pepper crab. Restaurant was about to shut but did offer us to be seated if we didn't mind the dining will be only 1hour.Food was really fresh and yummy, we spent roughly 350sgd for three courses and three beers. Acceptable considering the service and food were really great
1
The menu has Thai style octopus. When the order was verified the server stated cuttle fish. I asked for octopus as duscribed on the menu. They still delivered cuttle fish. They even omitted one of the items we ordered and had to order again. This place just wins your money
1
Very nice ambience with poor service. Food portion were too small, each of us getting one or no food at all. 18 of us in two tables celebrated mothers day. We paid S$1,200.00 with contentment at all. Never will I recommend this place to anyone.
5
We had to take a taxi there and Uber back - app $20 by cab from city. Get there early to get a table facing the sea. Excellent service. Well worth one M-star
5
We stopped in Singapore for about six hours solely for a quick taxi ride down the East Coast Parkway to a crab restaurant. Long Beach Main came highly recommended by a local and it did not disappoint as we feasted on Chilli Crabs, Black Pepper Crabs, Mantou and Kai Lan. Nothing disappointed and we left more than satisfied, ready to face the long red-eye home
5
I have been coming here to eat crab for the last 20 years. It is an unforgettable experience. I had to fly to Australia and purposely took Singapore Airlines so I could have the day in Singapore to come here and eat Back Pepper Crab. I was there during a holiday and at lunch this time so it was not so crowded. This is not normal! Reservations a must. Not only do they have the different pepper crabs and they have an unbelievable variety of fresh shell fish from all over the world down in ... including Maine Lobster, Alaska King Crab. Unbelievable. Not formal, messy, and tastes fantastic. Typical super Asian service with a little humor, if you listen carefully. For me, the high point of visiting Singapore
3
Not a flashy place. Good for families, friends, definitely not for business. I recommend the outdoor seating. Very close to the taxi stand. Good service, not overpriced, limited menu and yet good dishes. I went for the spicy crab and the razor clams. Was very happy with my choice
4
A trip to Singapore should always include crab. There are two big seafood restaurants at this location. Long Beach is a bit more local. Both have great views over the water and the huge number of boats moored off shore waiting to drop or pick up their load.We ordered both a chilly crab and a pepper crab for the two of us. They were both delicious but I favoured the chilly crab and it's delicious sauce. And we had both the fried and steamed buns and both were good. And the very garlic greens were also great. But I have one huge gripe, when we sat down we were given a small dish of peanuts but I have to STRONGLY OBJECT to being charged $1.50 for the nuts without being told there was a cost. What a ripoff and a way to spoil a lunch
5
What an amazing lunch ! This was so delicious , it is an experience I will not forget anytime soon ! First , hats off to the very friendly and attentive staff. At the time we went the restaurant wasn't busy so it was great to have a chat with them about the food and their famous recipe of black pepper crab which they invented !!! They tried 81 different types of bal pepper before finding the one that will make this dish so famous!! We did order the black pepper crab and it was just heaven on earth !! As far as I'm concerned nothing else in the world mattered while eating this amazing food!! We also ordered the cuttlefish with spicy salt and pepper and this was another ridiculously delicious dish. The pea sprouts were also delicious We are planning on going back to Singapore in July and this restaurant will be on our first stop !!!! For those who have a few hours of transit in Singapore airport , the restaurant is only 10 min by taxi! And it's worth doing the trip!!!
5
I've been there few times with my colleagues for having sea food, and its speciality the Pepper Crab. Last week I took my parents for dinner ther and of course having the Pepper Crab. As always is very good, and other sea food is also good to enjoy.Plus the view of the beach and sea is very comfortable.Very recomende
4
We had a business dinner here with reservations and we were able to secure a small, private dinning room for our party (party of 8). The servers were very friendly and the food was great. We ordered the Black Pepper Crab and the Curry Crab. Both were excellent. We stopped by the Reddot Brewhouse before for the green beer and then ate here. It was a great experience
4
An aesthetic experience is isn't and certainly not one for a fist date but go there with good friends and share the black pepper crab, yum! We don't bother having anything else except beer on tap and we order a couple of crab at a time so they are nice and hot. A singapore special every time we visit and not to be missed
4
Restaurant packed on an early Sunday. 6.30pm. Delicious food. Staff friendly n helpful Especially Desmond, Elmer, Liu Ping. Even the part timer is good. Suggest you give him a name tag rather than calling him part timer. Impressed with the good range of wine selection.
1
Dirty and not healthy.
So crowded and late service with long delay.
You need to sit on your table more than 20 25 minutes. English speaking is weak as well.
5
Had our family dinner there last Sunday (6 adults and a baby) and every dish we ordered was excellent!Place was vibrant and we made reservations for alfresco seating; the restaurant faces the sea so it was quite breezy. Must order dishes are their signature Sri Lankan Black Pepper Crab- succulent fleshy crab chunks (shells intact) covered in finger-licking hot black pepper; Drunken Prawns-the "wine-laced" herbal soup is good till the last drop and Razor Clam (from Scotland)- served open-shell with generous dollop of garlic on rice vermicilli and heavenly stock!!Dessert came in a fanciful dry ice setting and the durian pudding is richly yummy...you can really taste the durian!The assistant manager, Jenny, who attended to our table was extremely helpful, friendly, efficient and made our dinner that much more enjoyable! Overall, very good service from other staff as well...from the receptionist who took my booking to the enthusiastic waitresses who served & cleared the dishes!
4
After 10 years, we came back to have dinner here last week just after landed at the Changi Airport.There are many Seafood Restaurants in the area, but we decided to dine here as their good reputation.We ordered Chili Crab, Herbal Prawns, Calamari, Fried Rice, Stirfried Kang Kun, and also the Mantao (steam bun) to eat with the chili crab sauce. Food are delicious, the service is good and the outdoor beach view make it more enjoyable
4
We got the set meal with a bit of an upgrade for 5 ppl, it was so so tasty! The clams were topped in garlic and were so tasty, the pepper crab was one of the best I've eaten in Singapore. Get the steam buns instead of the friend buns. The mango pudding for dessert was excellent as well. The icing on the cake were the wasabi prawns. Only downside is the place gets a bit claustrophobic.
4
quite good crabs, friendly prompt service, a typical old chinese restaurant kind of feel and vibe. the set meals are a little overboard in terms of portions and price, unless you are entertaining a large group of out of town guests, else the ala carte menu is pretty decent as well
4
We had a great evening at Long Beach with friends. Our friends had three small children and the staff was very patient and accommodating with them during our long meal. All f the food was very good, especially the cuddle fish and the lobster. Before dinner we enjoyed time with our friends children walking on the beach.All in all a great evening
5
Read plenty of mediocre reviews of Long Beach but had a really good experience:1. Food quality was top notch, the crab was fresh, juicy and the Black Pepper delicious. I love the spicy taste of it2. Sitting at the sea side, open air with the sun setting at 25-28 degrees is an experience on its own. Great to be away from the a/c rooms. Good location, therefore. 3. Service and "consultation" was awesome. While English level was low, we got a very honest recommendation on what to eat and which size of the portions to order. This implies that service personnel did NOT recommend necessarily the more expensive items but the "right" dish we wanted. Li Zhen Sheng stood out. Thanks for this Zhen Sheng!Prices on same level like Jumbo next door. We dislike Jumbo for the bad service attitude and for cattle herding attitude.
4
Me and my friends visited this restaurant on the way from the airport to our hotel for a very late lunch at nearly 3 pm. Luckily this restaurant is open from lunch time until midnight. We really enjoy the Singapore curry Crab here.. very tasty.. especially along with the fried mantou. We choosed the Norwegian Crab because they only have this except the King Crab and the Srilanka Crab. No local crab! So, its a little bit pricey. We ordered also the garlic butter sauce crab.. but the curry crab is the best
5
We went for a walk on Sunday and decided to try Long Beach and it was fantastic. From the moment we arrived the hospitality was superb. The meal was great and one of the lovely waitresses helped to crack the excellent pepper crab. We have been next door to that Jumbo place but honestly the personal and friendly service here is miles better!!! Even the cashier can to assist at one point. Well done Long Beach with excellent service from Ma Hui Chao, San San Yu, and lead that day by deputy manager Tiffany Tan! We will be back.....
5
Always love coming here. The menu and the flavors are always spot on. The Menu is very extensive and prices are fair. The location is great for harbor viewing.
4
Pepper crab was excellent, Chili crab was very good as well, pricey but worth the try if you visit Singapore.
2
Had the chilli crab no way it was 1kg sauce was great but only two bins to mop it up, be aware they charge for absolutely everything including towel wipes.This is an over priced restaurant where staff dont really care....give it a miss there must be somhere better....maybe Jumbo next doo
3
Had a quick lunch on the way to airport, just a little detour. Had the chili shrimp, water crest and sea food fried rice. Food was acceptable, and prepared quickly. Service was surprisingly nice. So if you miss your lunch before going to airport and had 30 minutes to spare, this is a nice place to stop by. Lunch with good view
3
Their Pepper Crab was good. In fact they have very good stock of Crabs, - Srilankan and Alaskan.However they need to improve the quality of their customer service. They lag behind. They offered fried peanuts. We thought it is complementary, but they charged for it. When we confronted, they said, but you did not say "NO" earlier. This was bit funny and I found highly unprofessional. Making people fool is not good business. When they charges about S$75 for a crab, they should not charge for such small things.Will recommend to people and with care
2
We book this restaurant by mistake and aim to book the main one instead of this one. We came in Chinese New Year time honestly the food is just so so. Not any special dishes hardly unforgettable. The black pepper crab is too salty and lots better in Jumbo restaurants
2
We had been told great things about where to get the best chilli crab in Singapore. After $11 taxi ride to East Coast Park, we asked if we needed to book. No. We returned 1/2 hour later and despite the restaurant having only one other table taken we were placed in a booth in front of the service area where trolleys of dirty dishes were piled up from a room next door. I noticed other couples being seated in the main restaurant area that also did not have a booking. The waitress, a sullen middle aged woman, did nothing to enhance our experience. Tables who arrived after us had their crab delivered before us. When our chilli crab arrived it was swimming in what looked like and tasted like a bottle of sweet chilli sauce. The $129 price tag for one chilli crab was not worth it. Very didsapointrd. Will never go back
4
To keep it simple, ordered the Chili Crab (asked for extra spicy - had to order more chili) and steamed rice. Crab was fresh - tender and meaty, sauce was excellent and the combo with rice was enough to satiate. Service was very attentive. The bib was necessary - no napkins provided, save for the moistened towel used at end of meal in combo with finger bowl. It is expensive, but the freshness of live seafood in the restaurant compensates. Simple location, but the food is the attraction and well worth the visit
4
Can't write much except.... pepper crab is out of this world! Going back to eat now!! Yum!! Ok let's add more stuff as I need to pause... sweet corn chicken soup... not happening, kailan stir fry in garlic, fried rice and chicken with cashew was good. Back to crab .
2
We were very excited to try the black pepper and chili crab after reading so many great reviews. Our main waiter was very friendly and helpful. Note, we were visitors on our honeymoon to Singapore. Since the price is dependent on the weight of the crab and season, we asked the waitress the average price, which she quoted us at $75. It seemed a bit high but we went ahead. The crabs were unfortunately very small and extremely hard to get any meat out of. $75 seemed an extravagant price for such small crabs. The sauces were good, but they were a little lost on us since there was hardly any meat to eat them with. They also brought us one bun each (there were two of us) for the red chili crab, halfway through the dish. They were delicious buns, that I read about previously, I had hoped they would bring us more, as I had seen plates of buns piled high walking to other tables. Hard not to feel like were possibly jilted because we were foreigners
5
Whether it's Black Pepper or Chili crab, Long Beach UDMC is still my favorite place, especially foreign guests who just want to have a bite of an iconic dish from Singapore. Other dishes are also good but the crab is a must.
5
Long Beach is a long established seafood restaurant in Singapore. You have to try their crab dishes; chilli crab, pepper crab, baked butter crab , etc. They have many delicious seafood choices from signature prawn dish to steam razor calms.
4
Great seaside location which is a great viewing area for ships in harbor. Very good extensive seafood menu. I opted for a Pepper Crab....and it was lovely. The service was pretty quick and efficient.
4
Back after few years and food remain amazing good. Great service and the Best Black pepper Crab. Cereal prawns also excellent.. don't miss the seafood fried rice what is good..
2
Seafood was very cold when served and prices are exorbitant. Not value for money. Will not consider visiting this restaurant.
5
What an amazing dinner, there was a large group of us enabling a lot of dishes to try. The Singapore favourites of chilli and black pepper crab were a standout, however the 'cereal prawns' were life changing. All the dishes were exceptional and the service was excellent.
1
While the food is good, I find the restaurant dishonest. We went there with some friends who were back from Seattle for vacation. They probably thought we were tourists and ready to be fleeced. Amongst other items, we ordered the salted egg crab and the black pepper crab. We were told the price per kg and would have thought that we would be charged accordingly, based on the actual weight of the crab. The salted egg crab was big and looked like it was 1 kg (thereabout) but the black pepper crab was only about two-third or three-quarter the size of the other. When the bill came, it stated the price per crab. When we tried to tell the waitress that the black pepper crab was definitely way smaller than 1kg, she said we should have checked before eating as she was not able to "take it up with the chef" since the crab had been eaten. Shifting the blame I guess. She also insisted that both crabs weighed 1kg each. I find it incredible that every crab would weigh exactly 1 kg.I would advise diners (especially tourists) to be mindful of this and clarify upfront what you are going to pay for. As for me, I will never eat at this restaurant again even if the food is good as there is nothing that irks me more than dishonesty
5
We had the Black Pepper Crab at this restaurant and at Sing $ 70 or so, it was not exactly cheap !The dish was DRY, but the full bodied flavor of the pepper really hits you on the first bite. The crab was meaty and since they also served us the gravy of the Singapore Red Chilly crab (ordered separately), we could compare the tastes. We found the Singapore Chilly crab a little sweet, the black pepper crab was a little spicy !Worth a visit if the price does not matter
2
Street cafeteria style setup servicing a range of deep(wok) fried seafood and other bits, sold to unaware tourists at top dollar. OK the Seafood in tanks is pretty interesting, a mini aquarium, but just taking this food source and blitzing it in oil is hardly cooking. Zero refinement
4
Set on the east coast of Singapore, Long Beach seafood is a no nonsense, simple serving one of the best chilli crab in Singapore.The crabs used are Sri Lankan crabs that's meaty with a sweet succulent taste flavoured by the rich aromatic chili sauce which is also great to soak up with toast to finish off the meal so a MUST when visiting Singapore
3
while the place is very busy, the outdoor seating is great and the Chilli crabs and Pepper Crabs are fantastic
wish the staff were a bit more attentive
5
Tried Srilankan Crab here. Probably one of the best after the Ministry of Crab in Colombo. Tried the set menu and they allowed it to be customized as well. House wine was great too.
5
The best in Singapore! we are glad to be here early in the afternoon as it was jumpacked with customers later at night. Seafoods are awesomeness delicious and tasty!
Service is quiet fast and staffs are polite and friendly. Sure to be back next time.
5
woow nice experience, best seafood nice location nice great food i love this food. staff very friendly and helpful

Probably my 5th time and the chili crab sauce is predictably tasty and the same but the crab tenderness varies in taste. Sometimes very delicious, sometimes bland and sometime with crab fat but most of the time none and yet the cost stays constant. You don't know what you will get. Other dishes we order were fried fish with sweet and sour sauce, pepper crabs, roast duck, sharkskin soup, bamboo shell clams and veggies. We stayed out doors. Service not perfect but worth going back for a 6th, 7th time for the chili crab and bamboo clams. This is a great family restaurant.

Singaporeans love food and Long Beach chilli crab testifies to this deep affection. I visited with our business partners who were long time patrons. I got the full treatment including the explanation about why Sri Lanka crabs are so big. There's a tank full of geoducks to inspire you too

Great atmosphere dining close to the beach line , nice warm breeze and great chilli crab and beer ! Our friends took us here and we were not disappointed, the service was great and everyone was accommodating. The food selection was excellent and everything tasted nice ! Surprisingly the bill was good too ! was expecting to be alot more but it was very reasonable.If you are up for eating outside then this is a great spot to go

Like crab and seafood? Like Asian fare? This is the place to go. They claim to be the originators of the world famous Singaporean chili and pepper crab. I can't speak to whether that's true but they do make some delicious versions of these dishes. I cannot tell you enough what a treat the crab is. Put the bib on and dig in. It's a messy dish so don't dress in anything you can't get dirty. And of course by prepared to eat with your hands. Make sure to get the soft warm buns to go with the Chili Crab. The other dishes on the menu are also wonderful: I recommend the pan fried Kang Kong in Sambal and the fried rice

I've always loved the food here. My family has been coming here from the time it opened. Sadly, on this occasion we were told that this restaurant is closing permanently.Long Beach at East Coast Park is in a great location by the beach. The manager & staff are warm, welcoming & attentive. The chilli crab, the squid stuffed in batter, cereal prawns, steamed fish & homemade tofu are our family favorites. I would highly recommend a visit here before it finally closes its doors.

I was taken there by my hosts and so I was hopeful for a delicious meal. We had white peppered crab, razor shell fish and some crispy king prawns. The portions were MASSIVE and the food was delicious. The environment is not luxury - its very "local' but there were hundreds of guests and all looked very happy

Awesome place to eat! Good Services & Friendly staff! Good Food and Drinks! we really enjoy to eat our favourite Seafood in Long Beach Restaurant! We will probably come back again!!!",)

This is really one of our favourite restaurant in east coast. we love to go there. Food is good and staff are generally nice and attentive.For the first time, tonight, at the end of the dinner, one of the supervisor spilled the glass of tea on us accidentally. My guest's pants was wet, my phone was wet as well. The supervisor apologised profusely. But as a senior staff, I expected him to propose to clean, and offer to send his pants for laundry or perhaps an effort for service recovery. Unfortunately it did not happen and he continued to only apologise. No further effort was made and yet we were asked if we needed anything further serving. I found that rather unprofessional especially from a very good and established restaurant.The manner in which he handled the situation was simply unacceptable

Nice meal of pepper crab and greens ... cool beer and veges.... staff were very relaxed and nice , not pushy or selling dishes... genuine service and standard of excellence unlike jumbo seafood meal next door ( see other reviews) price is 20% cheaper than other places in east coast and better value all round - enjoy and eat crabs !

excellent seafood restaurant. takes the trouble to ensure your prefer dishes are available even though they could have run out of stock. has another nearby outlet at umdc. believed they can transfer stocks as they are quite near. like the glass front view facing the main road.

Being a local, we are spoiled for choice when it comes to seafood in Singapore. I decided to try Long beach for my birthday as I have patronized other seafood chains previously (Seafood Paradise/Jumbo/House of Seafood/Melbenn/etc) and I regretted this decision very much. Never before have I felt so ostracized as a local in my own country.Firstly, we were ignored when my family and I entered the restaurant even when we had a booking, and upon me constantly gesturing to the waitress did someone come up to us and showed us to our table, which was dirty looking and right beside the tanks of fishes. Let me just tell you it is not a smell you would enjoy during your meal.Secondly ,the presentation of the food menu was ridiculous. Pieces of dirty looking A4 paper where the menu items were printed on, were placed in a clear folder/file. My 7 year old nephew can do a better job at creating a menu. For the love of God please take some pride in your food and get a proper menu.Thirdly, saying that the staff there are rude is an UNDERSTATEMENT. When I was ordering the food, the waitress kept interrupting me and telling me RUDELY that the food I ordered was not recommended (no reasons given), the portion I ordered was too big, the portion I ordered was too small, and all sorts of nonsense. B**** please, if I want to order a large Noodles for 4 person, it means I am hungry. I don't need you to tell me what to do or what not to do especially when I am paying Up to now I still look back at that day and wonder how can a waitress be this unprofessional.Fourthly, the food. The food is not terrible, but it was nothing memorable or life-changing. The price was life-changing though. For the price they charged, I for once thought I was dining in Ritz-Carlton. Its not about the money, more about how can they charge this amount for the standard of food they serve. I have no qualms on spending upwards of $500 for a seafood meal with my family at other seafood restaurants. But this place, no way.I have never reviewed a restaurant for 1 star in my entire Tripadvisor history, but only Long Beach have the honor of this. You people need to know the truth. Go to Melbenn/Jumbo/Seafood Paradise instead, where proper food and service is constantly on the table

It was a rainy day. We three friends went there to have some crab. We ordered set menu that was very nice in reasonable price. With prawn, crab, whole fish rice dessert and some vegetables. We had Chili crab in meal and one black pepper crab additional. It was amazing meal specially the Chili crab it's a must try dish. All of the staff made our dinner more enjoyable all of them were very courteous and always carrying a genuine smile. I ll visit definitely visit again there..

We visited this seafood restaurant on a Saturday night, and we made a reservation as we have a party of 12 and our visit was during the peak period. We ordered chilli and pepper crabs, baby kailan, fried rice, hor fun, bitter gourd, beef with spring onion, roast chicken, "wei cun" chicken, silver fish fried rice, steamed live prawn, among others. We were also told that the "spring water golden phoenix fish" was excellent and decided to try it.As mentioned by the many reviews before this, the chilli and pepper crabs were excellent. The buns we ordered complimented the chilli crab sauce nicely. The beef, roast chicken and "wei cun" chicken were decent, and the prawn was fresh and sweet. The hor fun was good too. The fried rice was passable but do give the bitter gourd a miss (the dish was almost untouched). We did not enjoy the "spring water golden phoenix fish" very much, and it was probably a case where a fancy name given to the common looking tilapia, which otherwise nobody would order the fish. Other than the "spring water golden phoenix fish" and bitter gourd, the food was delicious. Pricing was slightly more than $50 per person on average, without alcohol.

Visited this for dinner. Food was served quickly. Crowded as place is enroute to Airport, good place to stop for a final meal before flying off. Dishes was delicious - good fozr seafood. Waitress tried to recommend set menu - a bit pricey and limited to 2-3 pax, 4-5pax etc even though our numbers does not match. Al-carte orders equally good because you choose what you want to eat. A good brand and branches of restaurant
4
My wife's friends took us to the East Coast and we picked this restaurant who seated us immediately. Service was very fast and the place provided both napkins and wet wipes, a "better" restaurant indicator in Singapore.We were told no visit to Singapore is complete without trying the Chili Crab. We also had fresh Grouper, stir fried rice, broccoli and scallops and a fresh spinach like vegetable. Everything was prepared quickly and served.Great evening place for friends and family with easy access to Taxi's afterward

Looking for a place to try Chili Crab in Sinagpore, they mentioned this was more spicy which is what I wanted. Took the MRT and a walk to Long Beach. Was not busy when I got there . Got the chili crab , wanted to try the pepper crab as well but I was the only one eating. The crab was good the sauce was great. I was licking my fingers and wanted to take the chili sauce home. Had sauce and crab all over me. Not really a date place. Would definitely come back with more people so I can have the chili crab and try the black pepper crab as wel
5
This is an expensive place, however the chilli crab, Pepper crab, steamed fish are a must try. The location is also very beautiful.
5
Went there with my mom and family The captain is super nice and we really felt very special.We ordered set menu and happy with the food. Quality and quantity wise The Black pepper crab was really good Love their hor funThe razor clam is good with lots and lots of chopped garlic Service is par excellence. One of the best service I have experienced in Singapore.Thank you for a great experience
4
Friendly and helpful service. Best chillie and pepper crab I have ever eaten. Ask for some buns (good size served here) and dip in the chillie sauce. Heavenly, if you enjoy a spicy meal. Best to order both chillie crab and pepper crab and enjoy the totally different flavours.Will be back... again and again
5
Great location where you can watch the boats, but hard to reach on foot- although we were so glad we'd made the effort to get here. Service was just great, Thank you Jack for your friendly advice! The whole crab with fried buns was delicious, and the crispy whitebait was so nice we had to order a second portion for our table. Highly recommended in every wa

We only planned to visit the East Coast Park for a quick outing trip after city tours with buildings and shopping malls. However, our stomaches was full of fast foods, thus we had no choice besides seafood restaurant. I knew this restaurant thanks for reading hundred of reviews on tripadvisor. In my personal viewpoint, there are some features in the scale of 10 as below:- Service: 8.0Pros: staffs usually kept their attention to support clients at anytime; explained in detailed the peanut and towel will be in additional charge, in my country you have to be aware of that kind of costs without any explanation.Cons: we should be informed about the crab bibs. We forgot to ask until seeing next table clients were wearing them.- Black Pepper Crab: 10.0The huge Sri Lanka one with good taste. The pepper was not so much spicy but a light feeling on your lips. Crab meet is thick and sweet. I do not think which more I can expect on this dish. p.s: I tried the chilli crab at Makansutra Glutton's Bay 1 day before then I think I know exactly the value of ~70 SGD for a crab
5
People often visit Singapore and run to places like Jumbo Seafood because that's what always turns up. People - let me tell you, please give Long Beach a try. I'll tell you what to order so that you don't feel cheated.Black pepper crab: Long Beach pioneered the Singapore black pepper crab. What other place to than the ORIGINAL birthplace of the black pepper crab? The crabs are served perfectly coated with heaps of smoky black pepper in a buttery, dry sauce. It's not a saucy dish like the chilli crab - hence the dry sauce oxymoron. Chilli crab: The sauce is sweeter than you'd expect and the chilli has a nice kick - it gives you a warmth to the palate as you savor the sauce and the meat. The crabs are always fresh - I visit Long Beach at least 3-4 times a year and it's always been consistent (at least this particular one at East Coast Park). Fried 'mantou', or buns: You need this to mop up all the lovely juices and sauce. Razor clams: Always fresh and served with heaps of garlic - these are the steamed razor clams I'm referring to. Is seafood expensive? Expect it to be - it's Singapore after all and everything is expensive. But know what to pay for instead of ordering lobster or anything else in the menu
3
This was my first visit to this place, though I have tried some other sea food restaurants in that area. I had made reservations with a choice of my food specified earlier and the table was ready when we arrived. However it took them more than 45 minutes to serve a portion of Black Pepper Crab which is a signature item in this restaurant. The crab was fresh no doubt but the food was nothing special compared to the price. Service was very average with no attention to the patrons at all. I doubt if I should ever go back to this place again
5
Yummy seafood served by Long Beach.This long beach restaurant is located in the East Coast, for visitors, its a bit far from the main areas. (You need to take taxis to the restaurant)However, its still worth a visit. The night i went was not with a lot of guests at the restaurant, waiters give you big smiles and great services. Black pepper crabs/ shrimps/ razor clams are still the best!
4
Good spot on the east coast with a nice view of the sea. Recommend the de-shelled prawns in chilli crab sauce. A good, cost effective alternative to the chilli crab. Perfect for sunset to watch the lights on the ship come on ( if that floats your boat
4
Awesome black pepper chilli crab and tilapia in lemon garlic sauce!!! Best I have ever tasted! The place is pricey though and has a lot of hidden costs which I feel made our experience slightly lower than perfect! They charged for the wet tissues that they set with your plate and also for a plate of peanuts that they placed at our table which we had never ordered. We assumed it was complimentary! Even if they would have charged us $5 extra for the crab I wouldn't have minded, but this was a rude shock at the end of a lovely meal
4
A good experience, tried this place after reading all the reviews and was not let down at all will surely repeat coz of the food
4
Decent place for seafood , the staff is good and the place is well kept and clean would certainly repeat this place because of the food
4
Having dinner here, the seafood is fresh and delicious. The price is reasonanble as well. However, the service is a bit slow.
1
Went to long Beach seafood restaurant at East coast and was disappointed with the food and service. The seafood served was not fresh, staff were inattentive, staff were arguing with each other in front of the customers and staff serve customers with double standards because of race and nationality
3
I went here with my WIFE last Saturday. Although the food was very nice the bill was very very expensive, they even charged us for the tissues on the tables and a small plate of nuts they put on the table without asking us. The waiters are all pushing for profit here push more more more, push drinks its a bit too much would not go back again. 2 of us $255 !!! my wife only had one glass of wine.. 10% service + GST. TOTALLY OVERPRICED MUCH BETTER OPTIONS AT FAIR PRICES AT HAWKER DOWN THE ROAD
4
Only 3 of us, so can't order a lot. Good location for departure guests as on the way to airport. But to get to the airport, exit bedok south and u turn back onto ECP. Black pepper crab is nice as usual. Bamboo clamp, fried baby sotong, breadded scallop, top with Yang zhou fried rice and many tiger beers. we want to try the lobster but alas we are full. Service is good and prompt. My japanese colleagues want to return again next trip.
5
Long Beach has been renowned for its sea food for decades and therefore has a regular flow of clients. We visited for lunch on a Sunday and the restaurant was only partly full though. The quality of all the dishes were outstanding and portions were generous. However, the meal costs around USD 100 per head which is quite price
4
There are other addresses but this one has been my regular place for a long time, and there is no trip to Singapore without going there. I can't decide between chili crab and pepper crab, so I have to convince someone among the party to order one while I take the other. Don't forget the jug of Tiger beer to go with it and you're all set to embark on a messy, tasty, finger-licking experience. Nothing like it, really. I cannot wait to go back
2
The food at other braches are much better, even at the other east coast location. The staff here are also not very well trained and food get cold when search even when its not crowded. Some of the dishes are old fashion and greasy in todays contexts
5
We have been here a couple times 3 years ago, loved food, everything is great! Our flight got delayed, so we had to stay overnight in Singapore... Long beach UDMC made this unexpected delay more acceptable! It actually made us think it's kind of good to spend time here and taste great chilly crab & other seafood! Never disappointed!
5
The title says it all.. A great place to have some delicious seafood with family in a beachside view cosy restaurant.. Three cheers to the chef and the staff..
5
This restaurant is famous for sea food or better to say fresh sea food. They have big aquariums to keep live sea animals. One can also select at the time of ordering the food.
2
well first of all the East Coast park was dirtier than downtown; second of all the foods here is more pricy than what was served (the same staffs) in downtown (Quay bay area). so...
5
Stopped off for an hour before a flight.
Fantastic chili prawns and pepper crab. The staff couldn't do enough for us!
Will go back.
4
Had a enjoyable evening meal. View was great at sunset.The crab was delicious, but unless you are a pro, get one on the waiters to help with cracking it open. Also had a prawn dish - very good. Vege dish and rice were quite standard.A bit pricey, but it's Singapore if you want value go to your local food court
5
Literally pulled of the street and ushered into this restaurant with my wife for the beginning of a romantic seafood dinner. Extremely rapid, friendly and efficient service with drinks in front of us within minutes. Very large and very busy restaurant with display tanks with lots of unfortunate marine life. The nenu was a little intimidating for a humble Australian couple, however, the brilliant advice from Sales Manager, Desmod Ten was invaluable. Desmond made our experience memorable. Humble, knowledgable and honest, he was amazing. We shared lobster and a large plate of Asian style prawns (shell off) with silverfish rice. Expensive but Desmond and his staff made it worth every penny. Highly recommended for a super seafood experience
4
It may not have a michelin star but it is worth one. After a long walk through ECP, we landed at Long Beach. We ordered garlic broccoli, Chilli Pepper Crab and Citrus Prawns, with a side of steamed rice. To try the best that is all you need here. It is a spacious restaurant, quick and good service. The food is fresh and finger licking good. The ambience is perfect, a seafood restaurant set up next to East Coast Beach. It is a definite 'MUST TrY' if you are visiting Singapore for the 1st or 100th time
4
this is where the locals come to eat. plastic chairs & table cloths, order fast & eat it quick.When I asked about the different saki [there is no wine on the menu] the staff had no idea, obviously not ordered much!Chilli crab wasn't too hot & was delicious. I had some fish 7 the kids roast chicken & rice.cheap , cheerful, great value, full of life
3
I had high hopes for a top seafood meal but came away disappointed. The evening was steamy, and we were ushered to our table where we were slotted in like sardines, cheek to jowl with neighboring diners. We ordered chili crab, which is a large crustacean swimming in a sticky sauce in a bowl the size of a small bathtub. I love the taste of crab meat, but the trouble of extracting it from its shell generally exceeds the pleasure of the meal. We also had the steamed pomfret, which turned out to be a mean looking fish floating in a watery mix with bean curd. The bill was huge. I notice that we were charged for the serviettes and tea. Given the top dollar charged for the meal one would have thought these basic items could have been complementary. My wife loved both the crab and the fish, so who am I to judge? But in my mind this is a tourist trap, and there is better seafood to be had elsewhere in Singapore
4
After a long flight we arrived in the evening to the airport, my friends were coming with a different flight which didn't offer a meal... So all of us have been starving. Quickly decided to go for a nice meal before heading to the hotel. Ended up at Long Beach. ..beside the nice view and street entertainment we didn't have to look very hard to find a good restaurant. The place we choose looked very popular, but we quickly got a table and served by the waitresses. One of us who knew a bit more about the local specialties ordered different types of food. It didn't take long till the dishes arrived to our table. Everything was delicious, but the chilli crab won the most likes.I Recommend to everyone who is travelling to this country and like the spicy seafood! It is not a small dish so maybe it's the best to share...
5
One of the best chilli crabs going around. Served traditionally with bread and slaw. The hero is the crab.
5
Staff were very friendly and always smiling. They will attend to all your needs. They even suggest what is the best in the house.
We tried the chili crab & pepper crab set meal. It was very nice. My guests were all satisfied.
4
Today we had chilli crabs 1kg = $78.00
Chilli crabs were great. A week before we went to jumbo so we compared chilli crabs
Long beach were a little bit spicy but very similar overall.
Highly recommend both.
5
Third visit to this restaurant
Food is great its a tourist magnet so you do pay the price however highly recommend black pepper and chilli crab
4
The crabs here are simply delish! We had ordered the black pepper crab, chili crab, deep fried duck, and a host of other dishes including the mantou (buns) both steamed and deep fried to accompany the chili crab. Yum!!!The dessert that I could see nearly every table ordered was the mango or sago pudding sitting atop of jar which had dry ice in coloured water was gimmicky but looks like everyone fell for it and paid for it too.Amazing seafood meal and would love to come back in next visit
5
Went to this restaurant and had some amazing seafood - black pepper crabs and razor clams. The food was delicious. Sat in the lawns which offered a great view of the sea - and it all added to the experience. Would highly recommend this place for some great food
5
Our family of five had dinner here with a couple of very dear local friends in one of the private roomsThere was a lazy Sussan which made sharing everything easy and they serve you a special tea which can help cool your mouth from the spices We entrusted ourselves completely with our friends who ordered us the pepper and chilli crabs. Both were AMAZING!!!!!! Very messy which is why they supply bibs, nut cracker to assist opening the shells and water to refresh your messy hands. It can be tricky at times but oh so worth it and great funNotes : the our hosts ordered one of the chilli crab dishes that has been toned down for 'Westerners'. My 11 year old son found the pepper crab too hot so didn't try the chilli which was actually cooler spice wiseWe also had the fried bread which is almost like donutsThe staff were so so friendly. One of the waitresses took to my son with his rosy cheeks and asked for a photo with him which was very cuteMy daughter has a nut allergy and we produced her allergy card in Malay for the chef and they went out of their way to make sure she was at no risk which we were most grateful fo
5
We were taken to this restaurant by some of our close friends who are Singaporeans . This Restaurant had very good seafood and many more authentic dishes . The chillie and pepper crab are the best . Understand that this is a legacy restaurant which commenced in the 1940's and still seem to have got it right . Definitely worth a visit . We had an unforgettable time
3
very high price, and the quality of seafood is just fair. We went there on Chinese New Year holiday, the waiters were busy and not helpful, We felt that they wanted us to finish the dinner quickly so that they can offer the table to other customers. Overall, we paid more than 400 SGD for a set dinner with only 5-6 small dishes, include only ONE black pepper crab for FOUR people, it is really not deserve the price
4
Wow. Really interesting place, even though you won't find any luxury or sophistication here, except in the list of the people having visited before you... (ask the tenant). When ordering the crabs with my colleagues, we thought we would get the animals on plates but we got them in pieces, mixed with the chose sauces... but everything was really tasty.Probably not the right place for a solo or romantic dinner... but great with friends or (good) colleagues
5
I visited this sea food restaurant with some local staff when on a two weeks business trip. Very nice sea food in Singapore style, delicious prawns, crab and squid for decent prices. Place was filled with local people on a Thursday evening. Top!
5
This place served amazing Sea food. Especially the Crab gravey and sweet bus. The Crabs were also yummy. Thoroughly enjoyed the food and want to go back there again next time.
5
WOW !!!!!! The Crab. Being no stranger to crab being an Aussie and cruising 5 years QLD, NT, WA catching and cooking our own. (Only pre order over 1.5kg crabs ever ! Otherwise all shell.) The black pepper crab is to die for, as is the crab and fish soup. The Satay is authentic and sauce as good as Melaka. The chilly crab is great but a little sweet for my taste compared to Malaysian style, but lots of ginger and garlic all great. The Seafood hofan, unbelievably great.The manager Paul Gan is on the ball. If you are not sure show him this recommendation and he will look after you.Undoubtedly the best restaurant for value in Singapore. Possibly all Asia. FANTASTIC.But he would not let me pay, because my good friend booked the table. The only negative
4
About 20 minutes drive from our hotel at Bras Basah brought us to Long Beach Seafood restaurant, East Coast Park.The place had a row of seafood restaurants.We came early (6pm) as we had no reservations. A number of tables were already occupied.The Restaurant is by the sea and there were indoor n outdoor seating. We took an outdoor table and it was cool and serene.Staff were friendly and attentive and the Captain was very helpful in our selection of the various dishes. A whole long list on their menu, Their speciality is the Black pepper crab but we came for the Chilli Crab.We ordered the Sri Lankan Chilli crab which was very fleshy and the tangy spicy gravy was delicious. The steamed prawns were very fresh and together with vegetables and a tofu dish, we had a good dinner.We also like their durian pudding and the coconut drink was refreshing.All-in prices were not too bad and we enjoyed having our dinner by the sea
5
Everytime I travel to Singapore, this is the last place I eat before departing, and Black Pepper Crab is ALWAYS in my order.Long Beach boasts on having invented this delicacy, don't know if its true, but they do make an excellant BPC.No trip here is complete without it.The rest of the menu is full of fresh seafood (you choose it while its still swiming in the tanks) and it is prepared for you. The noodles are also quite good, as are the steamed prawns.The restaurant is basically the same as the others in the East Coast Seafood Park, located on the bay, overlooking the water. It has an airconditioned area, and an open area. Dinner in April is ok in the open area, as there is usually a nice breeze.Anyway, if you're in Singapor, try it
4
Each time I'm in Singapore, its a visit to Long Beach UDMC for Pepper Crab. Delicious seafood dishes, good service and such a pleasant, relaxed outdoor seafood dining experience, overlooking the sea. I have recommended many overseas friends and business associates. Reviews and feedbacks have always been very good
4
A great place to enjoy tasty sea food with a wonderful atmosphere to boot. They do amazing crab dishes as well as prawns and Pomfret.. Simply great taste and a great place to chill with your friends at dinner. Service was fast and efficient too. Would definitely recommend
5
Dropped into Long Beach again, on my short business trip to Singapore. We had all the usual good Singaporean seafood, Chili Crab, prawns, Pepper crab..... I have always been a fan of Jumbo Seafood, which is just down the road on the East Coast, and I would say, Jumbo is good, and has a better outdoor experience, but Long Beach might just be better now on the quality of the food, and service. I thought it was top notch. We also order a beef dish this time, forgot the name, but that was great too. Will be dropping by again on my next trip to SIN.
5
My husband and I were really looking forward to finally getting our mouths around the chilli crab and the black pepper crab. To be honest we both much preferred the black pepper crab. It was divine. Our mouths were tingling from the pepper but it wasn't over powering - just right. The chilli crab was more sweet chilli then hot chili so not quite what we wanted but still delicious. We indulged with dessert and had the durian pudding - never having eaten durian we didn't know what to expect. What we got was a rather delicious strange tasting silky smooth custard - seriously it tasted like onions but weirdly the pudding combination made it ok to eat - who would have thought. We also indulged in the sticky black rice - yum. Looking forward to returning for another black pepper crab dinner
5
I had visited this restaurant two or three times before but quite a few years ago, so when some local friends suggested to go for dinner there we jumped on the opportunity.Located on the promenade with fantastic views across the sea, all the way to Indonesia on a clear day, it's a great place to spend an evening with friends.We had some perfectly cooked and presented prawns and some chicken thighs in fruit sauce plus some vegetables,but the gem of the evening was a most amazing snow crab with pepper sauce! Absolutely delicious. They also offered to clean the shell and presented the clean meat ready for us to enjoy. Perfect!The staff are very friendly and helpful even though the place was packed on a Sunday evening with local regulars.The taxi ride going back to our centrally located hotel was about 14 dollars, admittedly with not much traffic at that time of night.If you are visiting Singapore I highly recommend this place even though it's not on the cheap end of the scale
5
Had a great dinner with friend. Product good quality really fresh. Good tast. Resonable time for service, good staff very helpful.
5
We actually had lunch at Jumbo Seafoods in the adjacent restaurant but trooped here for their specialty desserts.
A picture is worth a 1000 words!!
5
Ordered the chilli crab with deep fried steamed buns, cereal prawn and kang kong. Dinner set us back approx SGD150 for two of us. Staff were friendly, great view and atmosphere!
5
Came here with family for dinner. The signature Chilli and Pepper Crab are a must!! Worth every cent. Also a great variety of fresh seafood.
Definately worth a try.
1
The food is average, baby squid very "fishy". This dish is far better in other places. The prices are extremely high compared with other S'pore restaurants.
On top they overcharge when you order fish dishes.
5
I have lived in Singapore for a number of years & have had many guests staying with us. This is where I take them - sitting out in the evening, looking through the moored ships to lights on coast of Indonesia, happy families perambulating along the shore side path and Long Beach - staffed by her regulars and tables filled up with her regulars. As you tuck into the excellent crab (yes chili, yes black pepper - but really which ever way you prefer) it doesn't take much to imagine this must have been pretty much how it was 40 years ago. What to order? We don't deviate much from crispy baby squid (is there a better beer snack?), house specialty prawns, crab according to our guests taste (last night it was ginger & spring onions), Hong Kong style fish (steamed in a light soy flavored sauce), vegetables and silver fish fried rice. Everyone has their favorites and after nine years, that is ours! I am never unhappy at Long Beach
4
We had all the standard Singapore favourites, great chilli crab, drunken prawns, fried buns. We had a seat that had uninterrupted views of the coast, with a nice sea breeze. The service was prompt and friendly, and prompt clean plates kept appearing, they even had cute bibs to reduce crab damage to clothes.The centre itself (versus restaurant) looks unloved, maybe time to do a bit of gardening
5
Its one of the best places to go to to get your pepper and chilli crab fix!The restaurant has been sround for a really long time and it has been pretty consistent.we ordered both the pepper and chilli crabs..but my fave is the pepper!its got a bit if a 'kick" from the heat of the pepper!You Tiao which is fried with prawns and or fish served with mayo,fried sambal kangkong,bean sprouts eith salted fish and a fried rice with seafood.Its one of my favourite places to go to and once you are done eating..a walk down the beach is recommended!and thenyou will find a ice cream man selling ice cream the old fashioned way..between 2 wafers!Lunch would be udeal if that is your plan..maybe even rent a bike to cycle along the East Coast park?dress real comfy..Spore is humid and hot

This restaurant is located right on the waterfront and it is truly lovely at night looking at the lights of the many ships moored just off Singapore. It is a long way out of town, and we were taken by a local. It is definitely worth the trip out there. The specially made iced lemon tea was delicious, but the highlights of the night were the Black Pepper Crab and the Chilli Crab. The Black Pepper Crab was far hotter than the Chilli Crab, but delicious just the same. The Chilli Crab was sweet rather than hot, with the flesh being moist and very tasty. The crab sits in a pool of thick, sweet sauce which you can mop up with the sweet buns that were provided. A very memorable meal, which I would happily have again
5
Definitely a great experience to be had in Singapore. From the outside the restaurant looks like a fast food chain and Burger King being next to it doesn't help but once inside you will have a great experience. However, bear in mind you will see all the live fish, crabs, lobster, ... which you will have on your plate a bit later. We took a sent menu for 4 people with Chili Crab, Lobster, Soup and a few other things and really enjoyed it. Nonetheless, it is quite pricey - the menu is approx. SGD 175 per person

Good place to bring business associates for Chinese dinner. Service good. Food excellence especially the pepper and chilli crabs. Price reasonable.
5
The locals know this as the premier restaurant for black pepper crab. We had that drunken prawns and spicy crab. All were outstanding.
3
You might be curious as to why only three stars for this very well know eatery in Singapore. Well that would be the price. Crab was great especially the pepper crab, which they say they invented as was the chilli crab. The bill amounted to Â£50 per head without any alcohol or deserts. I can think of many Michelin starred places where your money would be better spent.

For seafood lovers, especially Singapore seafood, including chili and black pepper crab, I think Long Beach Seafood at UDMC is still hard to beat. Much better than other Long Beach restaurants. Red House in Prinsep Street is quite good too, when it is not hosting a corporate event. Besides the crab, bamboo clams and drop fried squid are always popular. I find the service standards acceptable as they get really busy.
3
I and my friend visited long beach UDCM restaurant together and we paid SGD104. It includes 1kg Chili Crab, 2 towels, and 4 fried Buns. Price of chilicrab is variant because it applies seasonal price. Also, be careful that if you don't want to pay extra charge, you should not eat the peanuts on the table before main menu comes out. It was overall delicious, but smell of Amethystanthus japonicus(Shangchai??) is little bit ackward to koreans. So I couldn't eat much, but my friend(also korean) ate it well. she said that taste is ackward but it's just okay. Someone said that if I didn't want Amethystanthus japonicus, I could tell that at order. Chili Crab is the most expensive food I've ever eaten in Singapore, but not the best, frankly. The restaurant is clean and peaceful. You may take a walk through the Eastcoast after eating here. View of Eastcoast was the best view of Singapore I've seen
3
we spent 600 dollars on a very standard meal and its the only time we felt cheated on our trip to Singapore the restaurants are generally ok but i was less than impressed with this one i would head to clark quay for a far better and cheaper optio
5
The restaurant is nicely located along the waterfront. It is well patronised and yet not too congested. The Drunken Prawns, Black Pepper Crabs and Chili Crabs were well prepared and delicious. The Prawns were big, Black Pepper Crabs (medium size) were very meaty with just enough black pepper and the Chili Crabs with the rich gravy goes very well with Mantou. Service was very good. The outdoor seating with seabreeze and sound of waves makes seafood dining more enjoyable
1
I went to Long Beach Seafood restaurant with my family last night. It took them a full 45 minutes to find me an English-speaking waiter. The menu is very limited and the food is made and served hastily. Once I'd paid the bill, the waiter came with my change and ... Wait for this...wouldn't let go of the change. Since I thought the pathetic service and food didn't deserve any tip, there ensued a minor tug of war over the change. Left disgusted. Jumbo seafood next door might look crowded but their food and hospitality makes up for it
4
Had not been there for a few years and it was still worth the visit. But as may be expected from popular places, it has been upgraded with table cloth, large outside dining area and many other items and in that way lost a bit of its origin. And it has become rather expensive, even charging for extra wet napkins in a restaurant where you are bound to get creasy fingers!But the drunken prawns, the chilli crab and pepper crab were all as good as in the old days and the Tiger beer lady still hard at work
5
We are on an international holiday and met up with some local business partners to try out the local Singapore Chili Crab. The crab was delicious, as were all the other dishes we tried. Service was efficient and we hardly knew the wait staff were there when it came to clearing plates and topping up waters. When we arrived (6:30pm) it was not busy. However, by the time we hit mains, the place was full and buzzing. Groups included families, business meetings and couples. There were no bad experiences to talk about
5
It was one of the best seafood restaurant in singapore. I am a frequent visitor. My favorite menu is their alaskan king crab with salted egg sauce. Their lobster is also delicious. It's really really pricey though. But anyway, you get what you pay for.
3
The food was great and the black pepper crab was excellent, let down by quiet unfriendly service. Shame as it a good location and potential good atmosphere.
1
The lemon chicken was so bad - all deep fried batter and sickly sweet bright yellow lemon sauce - like the lemon spread from childhood - fake.Very little chicken in the dish. The staff stood right beside our table hovering. Very overpriced.
4
I was unable to find the location at Dempsey Road which we went to Priscilla Chan the Sr. manager greeted us very warmly as did the rest of the staff. We went for the chilli crab which was wonderful. Also had the prawns in salted egg. the entire meal was verydelicious. The desserts were very good , all in all a must when u visit Singapore I believe they have several locations. The fish is in a huge case really fresh. lobster and some other fish were from Canada
5
There isn't a better place in Singapore if you are looking Pepper Crab and Chili Crab. Went there with 7 other friend and took their $318 menu for 8 people. It's got enough of all the delicious fares from its kitchen with 2 kg of crab cooked in 2 ways as you like. It also has a steamed fish which was a real steal. With other starters, 2 sides and a dessert it is worth every single penny.The only disappointment was the peanuts that is pre-set on each table showed up on our bill without warning.But it is a very good seafood place with friendly and helpful staff
5
I went with my colleagues for a biz dinner in Nov. It was so good, I brought my sister when she came to Singapore. Then another time when both my sisters were in Singapore. Why?The food was good. The razor clams with garlic were divine. The drunken prawns were awesome. The crab, say no more.I must mention that the service provided by one of the waiting staff was very good. She took the time to explain to us because we couldn't really understand mandarin and she had difficulty conversing in English. But we managed because both sides put in the effort to try. Haha. Her name is Dong Yan Qin. She works in this branch. She's awesome.Overall experience, all 3 times were good. Recommended

The East Coast Seafood Center offers many seafood places and we like the Long Beach the best. We love the pepper crab. I know it is super expensive and hard to find a deal, so we just bite the bullet and go to the East Coast Seafood center and depending on the wait, pick a place. For us, our first choice is the Long Beach, but in reality, they all are pretty similar. The Long Beach has nice tables out by the ocean and a friendly staff.We have been here enough to know that all the little extras cost from the peanuts to the extra hand wipes, but we don't care as we only come here about once a year and it is to splurge. We will always order one large Sirlanka crab with the pepper sauce, which is really good but also really messy. We also love the chili sauce, but save a lot by ordering shrimp in the chili sauce and the fried manatou ( the buns) to sop up that chili sauce. We also get the baby gylan ( a kind of broccoli) so we have something healthy on the table.Dinner for two with a jug of Tiger runs about $130 Singapore dollars. Crab is sold by weight, and I guess you could save some money by getting a small crab. Don't do it as the large crabs are meatier. If you have never had the pepper crab or chili crab, a trip out here is well worth it.
4
The Long Beach restaurant offers fresh seafood (you choose your lobster, crab or fish from one of the tanks), well and nicely prepared. The chili crab is really delicious, also the barbecued fish. The setting is nothing special, service is good and friendly and the bill above average. We paid about 80 SGD per person and had just simple drinks, so it is not a place to have dinner every night
5
We decided to try the black pepper crab and chilli crab for supper and it was simpy sensational... I personally preferred the black pepper crab (but I love black pepper) whilst other people in the group liked the chilli crab which is slightly sweeter. The meal was expensive however the crabs are from Sri Lanka and they were very meaty and worth the price. They do charge you for peanuts and refresher towels so beware. Definitely worth the visit
3
Lots of seafood restaurants to choose from and very popular with both locals and tourists. Not recommended if you do not have transport. I've been stranded there a few times as the place is on the way to the airport, so taxis do not come in and even if you call for one they fail to show up
3
This place services decent seafood at decent prices .. Worth a try ... Try to come early and avoid the crowd.. When it is crowded, service and food quality drops.
4
I like popular places where you feel the real local life.
I had authentic food combined with a familiar and careful service.
I had a great dinner, surrounded by the stars and a quarter of moon.
One advise: give your customers many napkins!
4
We enjoyed our seafood with different varieties of dishes with our grand son.The steamed fish was fresh and soft. The you tiau was excellent.as it was well done.Taste was very much better than some other restaurants.We had cereal prawns,vegetable and few other dishes.
3
Long Beach is one of the place that serves good seafood in Singapore. I have eaten here many times and all the dishes turn out fine every time.. That's consistent.
4
Long Beach has the best black pepper crab in Singapore in my opinion. This is the place to go for Black pepper crab.
4
Chilled ambiance, option to sit outside or inside.
Good crab options, the sri lankan one is usually the cheapest.
For those who can't deal with spicy food the "special sauce" is a great choice.
4
Took an early dinner here yesterday. I used to visit regularly but work commitments haven't allowed me time so not been in a few months.Restaurant was almost empty at 4pm and therefore we had a great table with a view overlooking the sea. It wasn't too hot and there was a gentle sea breeze making it very pleasant.Ordered their famous chilli crab - one of the restaurants signature dishes which was up to expectation and absolutely delicious - ordered the buns for dunking also. Very nice. Also ordered deer meat with spring onions which was very tender. And seafood fried rice as accompaniment. Superb selection of live seafood also. Ordered the mango pudding for desert to end on a sweet note which was excellent. Good service from attentive staff. Level of English has improved enormously on years ago. Great meal - if your looking for tasty fresh seafood this place wins!!
4
Chilli crab, black pepper crab oh so yum. Dip the fried buns into the chilli crab sauce....it's a taste sensation. Lovely location at the seafront, next to perfectly manicured trees and a lovely sea breeze. Book a table outside. Worth doing at least once whilst in Singapore...and don't forget to ask for a bib, because it's very messy business eating chilli crab
3
We had an enjoyable family dinner at Long Beach. We were at Mountbatten Road franchise. They did accommodate us without a reservation and they were quite busy with a private function. The food was average at best and the Tiger beer lady was a bit overwhelming. There was quite a delay in getting our vegetables served.I wouldn't rush back with so many good eateries available in Singapore
4
We came to Long Beach Restaurant just to try the famous Singapore Chili Crab and Black Pepper Crab. We also had the shark fin soup, which was very good. The Black Pepper Crab is excellent, spicy, so some people might not like it. The chili crab is better than the one we had at Jumbo Crab, less sweet, however the black pepper crab was the winner
5
We came here with work colleagues and were seated in the main restaurant, although there were private rooms for groups. The Chilli Crab and Black Pepper Crab were to die for! Looking forward to dining here again next time I'm in Singapore!
4
nice seafood here
lots of varieties of seafood can be taken here
taste is good also
price is above average....
5
This restaurant is noted for its peppered crabs and, indeed, I was not disappointed. Overall, we had an excellent Chinese dinner.
5
Situated in the East coast park, this restaurant offers good food with a view of harbour. The view can't be described as great, but the food is. I had their specials.. Black Pepper Crab, and House special prawns. Both were excellent.
5
This branch open longer hours than other branches, which gives chance to go in between lunch & dinner time to avoid crowded hours. Must try chilli crab with extra buns. The sauce is so creamy and tasty mix of spice and sweet.Get ready to get your hands dirty.Please note that everything on the table is charged like wet towels, green tea, and peanuts. You can ask the waiter to remove all if you dont want to have extra charge. Bring wipes to clean your hand after tasty meal
4
We ate there from a recommendation from friends - very fresh seafood -had tanks with live crabs and lobsters and fish. Ate a local specialty - Chili Crab. It was wonderful. If we are ever back in Singapore would go back to this restaurant. there are several branches of this restaurant in Singapore but this is the main one with the most variety of sea food
4
Good Chinese food that doesn't break the bank. A good selection of meat and seafood. I was with a local so they chose for me and I really enjoyed it. It's not 5 star, but service was good, food was very good, and the price was even better and that included a bottle of wine. Just in case you don't like it there is a BK next door
5
Not many of my reviews has this rating : A MUST DO ! The cadre is magnifique ( reservation mandatory), the starters unique and the main course, Black Pepper Crab & Chilli Crab Awesome. Spicy though - so think about ordering fried rice and shrimps for the kids. Prices worth the taste, not that cheap but worth the taste.
2
Deeply disappointed with the service at Long Beach. Sad to say; celebrated dad's birthday here n ended up waiting 45 mins for our food. And seeing people who came later recieve their food before us!Even then, the China waitress dont seem to entertain us , as we are non ethnic chinese; i suppose they don bother? And thus, the assistant manager had to entertain us, n other non ethnic chinese customers.Whats more, the china waitresses are rude and inept to handle customers who come from all walks of life.Lastly, the cereal prawns were not tasty at all! Safe to say, our last visit here and will be telling all our friends to visit Jumbo Seafood instead
5
We come to this restaurant at least once a month and we are ADDICTED. There much be something in that black pepper crab sauce that keeps us coming back for more. Our favorites are:Black pepper crabSilver fish fried riceBaby kailan with garlic(This portion is just nice for two people who love to eat
4
This place is always bustling with the locals and tourists. Known mainly for its seafood and for the variety of fish, lobsters and crabs - you name it and this place has it. Delicious and great menu.
4
Delicious and great service from the staff. Ordered the mouth watering chili crab and accompanied with fried mantao bread that is a must and the sweet and fresh tasting drunken prawn. Will be back for more.
5
My favorite is the crab with special sauce, is buttery and it's not spicy, adding a fried rice you have the perfect meal for 2.
4
This place is working with both local people and tourists.I had the Black Pepper Crab (my favorite), the Lobster “Portuguese” style, and a few other seafood dishes. All dishes were really very good. Staff was friendly and attentive.The Mango pudding was served in a dry ice dish! Delicious.Only remark : the air conditioning: we were almost … freezing
5
My Singaporean aunt and uncle brought us here when we visited them (Just a proof that even locals love it). The place looks so expensive. I have no idea how much our food cost --the perks of having a rich uncle, but I can assure you that the crabs and rice here are really great! Their appetiser kangkong with bagoong (shrimp paste) was so good as well, and that's coming from someone who used to cringe at the sight of green veggies
3
The Long Beach, maybe because it was half filled, lacked the 'gusto' atmosphere one had come to expect of a seafood restaurant where the diners are all fingers on deck over the crabs, and lively conversations prevail.Instead it was a rather muted evening for our table of eight, with equally quiet diners at the neighboring tables.We ordered 3 crab dishes - chilli crab (the sauce was alright), black pepper crab (didn't not live up to the restaurant's claim of being the 'inventor' of the dish, and steamed crab. The crabs were about only 500-600 grams each, so the pincers lacked the gigantic size that was always so pleasing to the sight and appetite. The fried man tou (buns) for dipping into the chilli crab sauce were really good and we ordered a second helping. (Didn't realize they were rather expensive until we saw the bill).The tofu with mincemeat dish was nice. We had two other dishes which were not memorable thus I couldn't recall what they were now.Overall, not quite the seafood dinner experience we expected. The bill was unexpectedly high too
2
We've visited UDMC for twenty years or so since living in Singapore in the 90s. These days it's just the odd nostalgia trip when we are on holiday. I'm not sure we will ever go back again. Prices were ridiculous for the rice and kai lan, the crayfish was S$10 for each half. The following day we went to a major hotel and had far better food and service for less money . The younger staff were very nice, the ladies "in charge" appeared keen to sell more food and beer and not much more
4
Our favorite spot in Singapore. We are coming back and back over 15 years now. This year we arrived @ Change Airport at 16:45. At 19:30 we had our Seafood Dinner @ Long Beach. And it was fantastic as always. The only thing what I need to mention, that the price level increased over the years a lot.
5
As the title says, excellent food and a nice, open air atmosphere. I tried the Black Pepper Crab, the Chili Crab, and a few other dishes. All were excellent. Spicy, but with alot of flavor. The Mango pudding is served in a dry ice dish, a real treat
5
Have been frequented Longbeach for over 10 years, for a regular chili crab fix. It is absolutely delicious and those little buns that are served with it just hit the spot. The house prawns are equally yummy, Singapore noodles, deep fried fish well the list goes on ... Have seen several other dishes in other tables with unusual contents, equally well presented if you are feeling adventurous. Great spot on the corner facing the ocean, wonderful cool breeze and ambience, don't forget the pitcher of beer, perfectly relaxing evening out and especially good for taking friends visiting
4
Tried both, the black pepper crab and the chili crab. They were absolutely delicious. Definitely a place to put on your list while in Singapore. The service is a little slow but well worth the wait.
2
Went on 11 june. There are 2 restaurants; jumbo and long beach at seafood centre.
The service is long.
Ordered ee mian, sweet and sour soup.
Both are too salty.
Only the crab dish can make it.
3
There is probably one thing in common for all Singapore tourist, we are probably still full from our previous meal but still looking for the next restaurant to go to.Our experience with Long Beach seafood is exactly that. First we made the mistake of not going to the original (first) shop, Second, we didn't go with an empty stomach. Because we didn't order much, only the chilly crab as main and one other item. We were very happy with our food. But the attitude some of the staff showed was really off-putting. We even caught one waitress showing signs of dismay after she grabbed our order sheet from her fellow colleagues. But overall, the experience was nice, we had a table facing out to the ocean. The breeze was nice and enjoyed the sunset with our lovely food. (Pro-tip: If you don't need to wet towel and the pre-meal snacks, don't be shy to say No before you order. Because they are not shy to charge you even if you didn't use them!
3
Originally we are planning to go to Red House for dinner but it was closed for renovation. Then we went to Long Beach as there was a queue at Jumbo and we did not want to wait. As usual we ordered the Chili Crab but the sauce has no kick in it and it was a bit sour for my taste. The fried mantau was a bit of let down too. Will not come back the second time as to me all the food was so-so
3
A group of seven of us had an early dinner there so as toadvoid the crowds.We ordered fried baby squids, their signature pepper crab, two vegetabledishes, which one of the vegetable didh was done with fermented beanpaste.We also had fried bean curd with pork floss, chicken drumlettes withfruity sauce, chilli crab and coffee pork ribs.I did like their chilli crab as the sauce had a sourish taste. As for thecoffee pork ribs, the coffee taste was overwhelming & it made it slightly bitter.The wait staff were helpful and our plates were regularly changed and ourtea was regularly topped up.I rate the food at 6 out of 10 points
5
Visited Singapore in 2012 and the concierge at the hotel recommended this restaurant and the buzz was really true! The best chili and black pepper crabs I ever had. I have been to Singapore numerous times and I've had my share of chili and black pepper crabs from the hawker centres to well recommended food institutions in Singapore but these Singaporean crab delights are most excellent here. Highly recommended and will definitely be back for more the next time I'm in Singapore
3
Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday partly based on a good experience about 2 months ago. But it was a disappointment. Party was crab-centric so asked for 2 large crabs done chilli style & 2 large crabs done pepper style as well as a very large steamed prawns (another favourite) amongst other dishes. Captain taking order later came back and said total bill was $375 - asked that I take it as a set meal (which had the same dishes apparently) for $362 and she would throw in a fruit platter for dessert. I confirmed with her that everything was the same as what I ordered and she said yes. When the food came, the steamed prawns dish was so small there was only like 16 smallish prawns for 9 of us. The crabs were small so all of us had barely 2 pieces each. The other mundane dishes like mee goreng and sambal kangkong were correct sized for our table of 9 but were not great - alright but nothing to write home about. It would appear that this ploy of getting a set was self-serving to the restaurant as we appeared to have got the shorter end of the stick in terms of quantity. We would have gladly paid more to get our crab cravings satisfied rather than have left with a bill of $435 in total and a sense of being a little cheated. Stick to ala carte and specify weights & sizes
4
Had been longing to go there after seeing the reviews on Tripadvisor. Very good ambience, food quality and standard. Fell in love with the food. Start with a fresh coconut drink. Try Crabs and other Sea food. You can see them live in the Aquarium. Service is pretty fast
2
Nice location and a change from being in the City. The service is good but it is let down by the little things. Peanuts are put on your table when you arrive..... Even if you don't want them .... They then charge you at the end of the meal. If you are having crab (and most people are) they charge you for the hand wipes at the end of the meal....... What do they expect you to do? Use the table cloth? I am happy to pay for my food but hate silly things that amount to greed of restaurants ...... Please don't do it 
5
Went here with friends and had both the Pepper crab and Chilli crab S$68 per 900gm crab. We also had the fried buns and some noodles and greens plus a deep fried sea bass. Wow excellent food reasonable although the $25 for a jug that gets 4 glasses of beer is a little high but worth it to get the crabs
3
We tried the black pepper crab which cost almost 100 dollar a dish. I would say it is tasty, but not so tasty to cost double than its counterparts in the same area.
Would not recommend.
5
We chose this specific location because we want to try the famous chilli crab that everyone told us about, but be able to sit outside by the water. We were not disappointed. We were given a lovely table, service was simple but adequate and the food was superb! I would strongly also recommend the fragrant clans with ginger which were delicate and very tasty! Definately worth a visit!!
5
Cravings for chilli crab is aptly answered even though Long beach is famous for their black pepper crab.The chilli crab sauce is thick, spicy and generous. I am still thinking of the crab at the point of writing. For the other seafood I tried, they are equally tasty and nice. The only bad point is that it is quite salty or maybe too much MSG is in it. I still feel thirsty after 3 hrs from the meal. Service wise, the staff are prompt and friendly. I was served by a PRC captain. He can speak fluent mandarin and English. A light reply of "you are welcomed" is nicely felt whenever I said thanks when he's filling up my water.Price wise, it is slightly on the high side probably due to the Mother's Day weekend. We are quoted $78/kg for Sri Lanka crab which is at least 10-15% higher than other similar type of restaurant chains. Overall, still satisfied with the meal!
4
It was true. The Chilli Crab is great!. Little far away from the city but worth the Trip. A taxi will drive you there for about U$10. Price of Chilli Crap is about U$70 per kilo, which would be enough for two hungry adults. There are other good options for kids
3
The place was nearly empty so there was no hurry and there was a nice breeze coming in off the water - very pleasant. I don't especially like seafood but I'm a very compliant partner so we did seafood. For me the rice was the best part but the prawns were pretty good. My personal view is that anyone, anywhere, who puts a spicy sauce on a delicate taste like prawn or crab or lobster should take a good hard look at themselves - it's pointless! You may as well spice up some tofu because spice is all you can taste. The best thing about seafood are the delicate flavours, dump a kg of pepper on a crab and you end up eating pepper. My partner enjoyed it though. We had a set meal so it wasn't too expensive. Staff were OK. We only came here because the Red House next door was closed
3
We've tried same restaurant at Dempey Hill and it was such a great experience that I crave for their chili crab and shrimp with oats. So, upon arriving in Singapore, we headed to their main branch, but such a disappointment, the chili crab tasted so different and the shrimps were so small. I will just eat agin at their Dempsey branch
4
The food was very tasty, even my boys (3 yrs & 22 months) loved the fish & bamboo clams! They have better dessert selection compare to Jumbo & no signboard! Service was great, the staff was very helpful with ordering! They don't have a baby change room but the staff let me use one of the spare room, very thoughtful!! The only drawback is it was hard to get a taxi after dinner!!
5
Went there with family of 6 on a Sunday evening .1)wanted to take a place outside the garden .but rejected by a China guy saying it is fully booked .then no choice juz take a seat indoor .so we started to order quite a lot of food .Lobster ,$402 ,red garoupa steam $108 ,crab $ 68 n few other local dish.we seated for nearly one n the half hour but outside is still not fully seated.Felt disappointed .secondly prices of seafood is very too expensive.$402 for one lobster n they tell me is 1.5kg but it dun look like 1.5kg as we frequent seafood restaurant quite often .they must have increase the weight of t lobster .for our xperience we had ,i think that lobster is only 1.2kg wat a disppointMent n t crab n fish is also too expensive .For my advice to others patron .think twice before heading to this restaurant .too ridiculous .pricing n service given with a 10% service charge .very disappointed .will not visit tis place in my whole life .
5
I had a great time having dinner with friends. One of the best restaurants that i have visited ever. Seafood are fresh and delicious. I love the crab the most which are steamed and with black pepper. Desserts are also nice and my fav is mango pudding. Decoration is perfect. Well, Foods are quite expensive out there but if u r quality conscious rather than price, its worth for dining out there
1
Like a few other seafood restaurants given to duping customers with underweight crabs and double-priced fried rice for excluded items, Long beach is not averse to throwing up surprises in their bill...food itself was average and their black pepper doesn't quite live up to the expectation but the overall experience was most muted by their hard-selling approach and covert billing mechanism...be wary of their pricing and any special requests such as extra spicy, no squids, etc
4
We did really enjoy the chili crab, we did! But boy was it messy and hard to eat. The server was kind enough to shell the crab for us after we nearly gave up. We really loved the octopus too. It's a don't miss.
4
Chilli crab very good, amazing prawns! Everything fresh and tasty, nice service and really cold beer! I recommend for good Singapore seafood
4
I'm not a very big fan of crab but their black pepper crab was just the highlight of my entire trip! Their house specialty prawn was also very good. Another favorite was their rice with dried scallops and egg white.We also ordered the chili crab which was a bit of a let-down after the fantastic black pepper version. Wish we'd had a second order of the black pepper instead
4
After a long day's work sitting near the water in the Long Beach Seafood Restaurant is a relaxing pleasure. It is a crowded but the staff is very friendly and helpful. Simple straightforward food, a good choice and it comes very fresh. The Black Pepper Crab is their signature dish and it is a good experience combined with some of the local beer
4
not fine-dining, but if you like fresh Black Pepper and Chilli Crab on plastic chairs with a large pitcher of Tiger beer, bibs and messy fingers, sitting outside by the water, then this is absolutely the place for you. If we had only one night in Singapore, this is where we would come !
3
Would love to give 3.5 stars. We come just for a quick lunch and orderHouse specialty prawnDeep fried prawn cooked with onion, garlic and salted egg. Very niceFruit ChickenI a bit confused earlier but just try the dish. The chicken too sweet. Not really niceFried BeancurdJust standard fried bencurd with sweet sauce and floss. Nothing special and taste so soFried KwetiawA little bit too oily but taste nice.Mango PuddingLove the way they served. The pudding bowl served on top of bowl with dry ice. My son love the taste and the presentation.Waiter very friendly.Nice sea vie
4
Had the Black Pepper crab here which was a welcome difference to the Chilli crab you get at most other restaurants. Apparently it was invented in this restaurant and I have to say the flavour was great and there was a decent amount of meat on the crab. Less spicy then your traditional Chilli Crab but still a nice bite to it. Food wise while it's nothing special to look at it was tasty and satisfying. Service was quick and "efficient" but you're really here for the the food not the ambience. Pricing was ok not, the cheapest and certainly not the most expensive in Singapore.While the other restaurants in the chain may look a little nicer, I think the food here is the most authentic
1
The ordering was so rushed. They have peanuts on the table which look like they're included with your dining experience and come to find out when we got the tab they charged us for it. They also brought out rolls with our chili crab which cost extra.. He had suggested that we get a plate of noodles when ordering and those were an extra $16.. They charged us for 3 'towels' which id hope and assume would be included considering how messy the meals were, plus I've never been anywhere that's charged for napkins or wet wipes. Given some of the extra charges were small but very frustrating when the meals were already expensive. This had to of been my worst dining experience ever. I probably would not go back. The crabs were a great price but all the extra charges and the ordering process and the mess was not ideal.

The speciality of this restaurant is Singapore pepper crabs in various forms. The food is good, but not great. The service is good, even if the restaurant is fully booked. Nice to sit outside and look at the harbour, but it is outside of the centre and you need to take a taxi or drive yourself
5
Imagine crabs the size of 2 pound lobsters with claws that you can sink your teeth into. Now imagine 2or 3 different sauces that they can be prepared in. Peppered, chili sauce or simply plain with ginger and scallion for those of you afraid of spice. But wait, there still the shrimp, the fish and many other delights of the sea to try. Take your carnivorous friend with you, they also have many meat dishes to choose from

Get ready to get down with the chile crab. It is spicy, sweet and delicious. My only suggestion is you need a shower after eating this delicacy.
4
We are big fan of seafood. Here they serve big Sri ma man crab in famous chili sauce. Crispy squid is good too. Slightly pricey.
4
absolutely yummy!! For a change we ordered the crab in white pepper which was sensational - a little more subtle then the chilli but still packed a punch. Had other seafood with chilli and steamed buns - can't wait to go back!
3
Chili crab is a must. And get the hand rolled small buns to eat the gravy with. It's not the best I told as the best seafood is apparently in Geylang.
5
The husband and I lived in Singapore some years back and always enjoyed the chilli crab from Long Beach. In a recent trip, which was solely to revisit old haunts and eat the food we enjoyed there, Long Beach was the first place on the list but we saved it till last!While the servers now wear hairnets, it feels like everything else is just the same! The jugs of Tiger Beer which go so well otak otak, baby kailan, prawns and the delicious chilli crab with fried buns.It just rounded our few days in the place we used to call home off in a wonderful way
3
I've been with my family 4 adults and a child a few days ago, we did not get attention to which menu and price (waiter was pushy) we choose but at last we had a 5-6 people menu and the bill was more than 850 SGD with just one jug of beer!!!It's just indecent to pay such a price for 4 adults and a child, we were really disappointed and I would not recommand to listen the waiter advice : take your time, Watch the price, add a service of 70 SGD and think about GST before you choose..
3
Wanted to go for early lunch at Long Beach UDMC which has nice harbour views, but opening hours meant we tried Long Beach MAIN instead. Overlooking the car park and fast food outlet the location is nothing special. If you want to go the full seafood experience it may workout ok, but the other choices were limited and not at all memorable.
5
Visited with business associates and had a wonderful meal! We had a group of ten and the food was served on a lazy Susan. Everything was good but my favorites were the chili crab and the cracked pepper crab. The meal was topped off with a dessert of durian pudding, which is not bad if you hold your breath! My host described the aroma as pungent but I could think if other less delicate adjectives... The service was wonderful and it was a very enjoyable meal
5
Our friends brought us here and so glad they did. Best chili crab! Hubby still has dreams of the crab. All food was delicious with fast and efficient service. Loved the deep fried small squid and sautÃ©ed spinach. Will definitely come again when back in Singapore
5
We knew we wanted our final meal in Singapore to be a pepper crab, and were told by a friend that Long Beach did the best one in the city. And to be fair, it's not like I trawled Singapore's streets for pepper crab, but this place certainly did not disappoint!It was a nice chilled out spot, with a great breeze. It wasn't too busy when we were there for lunch, and so was a lot more relaxed.Service was good. And it was good value
5
Visited with some friends whilst staying in Singapore and I have to say it's the best chilli crab I've ever had. The black pepper crab was OK, but nothing special.
The service and price were both good. Highly recommended if you're in Singapore.
5
I've not tried Chilli or pepper crab before so i have no reference but always been a fan of crab. The dishes here is lovely, service is prompt, helpful and attentive. Despite being a very busy restaurant, it operates very efficiently, very impressed.
5
We wanted to try the famous Chilli crab while in Singapore so searched through Tripadvisor to find the best place. This place did not disappoint. We had one of the set menus as there was a group of us and tried both the chilli and salt and pepper crab, both were delicious. As its a messy job eating all that crab you are provided with plastic aprons which is probably just as well! We had a large fish as well although I can't remember which one and a few veg dishes all were great
4
This place specialises in sea food and does it well. It feels right to eat seafood by the sea shore. The service was average, but the food superb. With crab being quite messy, it was smart to provide the diners with plastic aprons. Do not look at the dÃ©cor which is mediocre but with nice views it does not matter
3
The outside nor the interior is attractive and certainly not cozy but this should not turn you away from this place. Believe me the food is great.I had some drunken shrimps, crab in black pepper sauce and langouste. Each plate was prepared to nearly perfection.Quick and friendly service.Looking forward to come back to this restaurant

Long Beach Seafood Restaurant is undoubtedly one of the best seafood restaurants in Singapore. The restaurant have a large selection of live seafood to choose from, all dishes were well prepared and perfectly cooked, very reasonable prices, courteous and excellent service. We were a party of 6 and was recommended the set for S$366. Wow, we were served 2 good size chilli crabs, very meaty, perfectly cooked, aromatic and delicious with a taste of lemongrass, it was simply superb. The next course of steamed bamboo clams with garlic was very good too. So were the almond prawns, stir fried long beans with XO sauce, steamed grouper, braised hor fun (flat rice noodle) with shrimps. Plus a dessert. No disappointment at all. A great memorable dining experience for my foreign guests. The portions were very good and we were filled up. Will be back soon
5
We chose to eat at Long Beach Main Restaurant with a few colleagues and the food was outstanding! We chose to have a set meal with the famous salt and pepper crab which everyone agreed was the best meal we had in Singapore.Check the set menus for excellent value
5
You can bet your last dollar to get the best crab over here. The ambience is more homely and so is the service. I am a very regular customer here. My only issue is how to find transport back to my place! It costs a bomb to get there. Otherwise, I have no other complaint
1
Attended on recommendation..... big mistake. The 4 of us (Australian friends 40 yrs) had visited 9 countries on our Asian tour from Shanghai to Singapore but never experienced anything like this restaurant on 22nd Sept 2014. Cost $20 for a taxi from the city, that was fine. We expected to pay a high price for our food and beer, the bill was $261singapore,OK but unfortunately it was the worst value for money on our whole trip. We ordered the set menu for $188 for four, first we had very small plate of bok choy for 4, jug of beer, 2 crumbed prawns each, 1 very small fish for 4, so far about a mouthful each, then a small bowl of fried rice each followed by the smallest chilli crab in the place, again about a mouthful of crab each. Then the english speaking waitress Jessie (who could'nt give a dame about quality service) told us we had to pay for the buns to eat with the crab, it was a set menu! When we politely complained that the food was minimal for the price, she shrugged her shoulders and walked off. When we got the bill we had to pay for the wet towels (wipes) and the peanuts we did not order. Very disappointing on our last night in Asia, left the restaurant fumming. Seriously we had similar quality meals in some of the small restaurants for half the price. DON"T BOTHER with the this so call high class restaurant you are just paying for the name and little else!!
4
We went with the whole family and had a banquet - and my oh my - superb food, excellent service and a great atmosphere. The crab is magnificent and the prawns - unbelievable. The level of service was quite exceptional and I soon discovered that if one is not fully aware of what is what (on the menu) a member of staff will be only too pleased to be of assistance. Yes it's some way out of the city but it's worth the effor
2
We ordered pepper crab and was given not fresh crabs.
We feedback to the staff and good thing she changed it immediately with no question asked. But definitely not the best seafood in town.
4
Visited with 3 friends on a girly weekend, me on a mission to find the best chilli or pepper crab and oh yes! found it! The pepper crab was absolutely sensational! Just wow! Fresh, tasty, good price. Definitely the best ever pepper crab I could find - you HAVE to try it! You won't be disappointed - so amazing
5
My partner and I took a walk through East Coast Park and stopped by here for some seafood. Many might call this a touristy place to get the famous Singapore Chilli Crab and normally I tried to avoid tourists places in favor of local joints but wow.... it was good... and I mean real good. Don't even need to think twice, this is the place to have crab. There are many other locations too that will have just as good crab, but for a safe bet, come here
4
Located in East Coast, we travelled here almost by mistake - one of my dining companions wanted Chilli Crab, rather than Black Pepper Crab. We were happy though that we dined at Long Beach for the Black Pepper Crab. Got the S$209 ++ banquet meal for 3-4 people, which was way too much food. The Black Pepper Crab, of which Long Beach is famous for, was definitely worth the trip out to East Coast. The Shark Fin soup was also very good.A great mixture of people (families, business people) were dining while we were there. Tip: Best to call and make a reservation, and try to get an outdoor table. Also ensure you tell the Taxi driver to go to the UDMC restaurant, as there are 2 Long Beach Restaurants along East Coast (and the other Long Beach does not have the ambiance of this one). The restaurant is located around 20 mins from Central Singapore (almost back at Changi Airport) which means if you have a couple of hours to kill at Changi, you could quickly visit and get a good feed before getting back on the plane
4
Totally out of the way (15 min taxi ride from the CBD) but good crab at a reasonable price. Try the black pepper as well as the chilli. Get the buns to dip into the sauce....and if you go at night pretend the freight ships' lights on the water are fairy lights
3
We wanted to try the Black pepper crab & we dropped it at this restaurant in ECP.Much like the experience of other reviewers here, the waiter suggested the Sri Lankan crab, the peanuts & wet towel were charged & price was quite expensive.The 'red chilli' & 'black pepper' crab dishes are more of a tourist attraction in SG. U wont be disappointed with the quality or taste of the food. The menu offers quite a few options for rice, noodles & other starters (fish, prawns & other sea food). I lived in SG before & the usual feedback from many reviewers about cheaper but good alternatives is not untrue. But then. if u r a tourist & would like to have sure good crab dish, then just visit the place. Its open till late nights on weekends. We ordered the black pepper crab, garlic prawn starter, sea food noodles for our dinner. The crab was well cooked & was very tasty. Rest of the dishes were just normal. With two ice lemon teas, the bill for these items was $115. Service was very friendly & it started raining heavily when we returned. The staff helped to book our cab & also guided the driver to park in a spot that wont get us wet when we boarded

Last night I took two friends to the Long Beach location on East Coast Road. I booked an Alaskan king crab in advance, something Singapore friends had done for me on three previous trips to Singapore. The crab was, indeed, fantastic. No complaints. I can never get fresh, live Alaskan king crab at home on the east coast of the US, and the texture of frozen crab legs is simply not the same. Fresh crab has none of the spongy rubbery texture of king crab on an "all you can eat" buffet. The prep was perfect, a fiery hot black pepper sauce for half, and the traditional rich, red, egg and tomato "gravy" of the traditional Singapore Chili Crab on the other half. The sambal asparagus was also great â€” cooked perfectly, slightly al dente, with a great fruity and spicy sauce that complemented but did not drown the taste of crisp fresh asparagus. We had a great table with breezes from the Straights and a view of the container ships parked off shore. We loved it. Then the bill came. I had never seen the bill for a live Alaskan king crab. It was just over $600. My friends were good sports and we shared the bill without anyone getting angry at me. Indeed, we might have ordered the Alaskan king crab anyway, even if we had known both how expensive it was, if we had also know how good it was. But it's good to know in advance what you are getting into! The additional charge of $0.90 for the paper towels and $1.50 for the peanuts that were sitting on the table when we arrived just added to the amusement. Recommendation: Go. Book a table in advance. My preference in order is the White Pepper Sauce, then the Black Pepper Sauce, then the Chili Crab Sauce, but on a first trip or on a trip with out of town guests you must try the Chili Crab Sauce first. I prefer Long Beach to Jumbo, and I prefer an outside table. You can get almost all of the experience with a traditional Sri Lanka black crab for a fraction of the cost, but it's a lot more work to eat a Sri Lanka black crab

An unexpected invitation for dinner at Long Beach Seafood Restaurant in Singapore - and treated to some fantastic food - the best of which was the black pepper crab and the chilli crab - quite simply delicious. The rest of the food was great too but the crab was perfect and well worth a repeat visit - which I shall definitely be doing. The service from the team there was top notch and they made good recommendations. A good spot to eat early evening outside as the daylight fades and all the lights from the ships moored out to sea begin to come on. Good food, great setting and one I hope to repeat
5
It is expensive, but well worth it! Singaporean Crab Dishes is one of the Top 30 most recommended foods to try for a traveller. This restaurant is the original creator of the Black Pepper Crab dish, and even has an awesome Chilli Crab. Every item is fresh, and you can see their whole supply. A simple review cannot give justification for how great this place is. I HIGHLY recommend it! Everyone should go at least ONCE

Took my son for his birthday to wherever he wanted. He chose to go to whatever restaurant had the best Black Pepper Crab. On the suggestion of several friends, we went to the EC Seafood Area where Long Beach, Jumbo, Red Door and about 4 other seafood restaurants reside.Chose Long Beach because of their claim to having invented the Black Pepper Crab dish. Standard outdoor layout, live tanks inside, marginal service (like many Singapore restaurants) & pretty high prices. Ordered the house special shrimp (medium), 1 grilled squid, fried rice and 1 pepper crab. I asked for the Sri Langkan crab, but was told they weren't very good today and were only a little cheaper than the snow crab running $90 Sing dollars a kg - smaller crab running about 1.2kg. Ours weighed 1.3kgThe food above plus 1 water and a pitcher of Tiger beer was $270 Sing dollars (205 USD). The 3 of us were reasonably satiated but hardly full.Quality was good but frankly, I get better crab at Fatty Crabs in KL for 1/4th the price BUT we were in Singapore and I know in my heart there are places with better service, same quality and cheaper prices.I will continue my search again next month when I get back there.Will I go again? Probably not...There's too many other option
4
Situated at East coast in singapore, the seafood and crabs are nice at good price. The environment is clean and staffs are friendly
4
Great local fair with awesome service...food was brilliant with good recommendations from the waitress! Highly recommend....
5
If you want to treat yourself to delicious crab, it is worth splurging on the Alaskan King Crab with the white pepper sauce! Yum!!!! It is a buttery sauce laced with white pepper and other spices. We also ordered the local special which was the Sri Lankan crab with the chili sauce. It was not as tasty as the Alaskan King crab. We ordered a 4kg. Alaskan King Crab and finished it between the four of us! It was probably one of the best crab meals second to the tamarind crab that I had in Vietnam. Make sure to go there hungry because it can be a very filling meal

We living in Singapore, find it exciting to make a nice day out with roller blading, cycling and then pepper crab meal. However, dining out in Singapore has become a chore as restaurants are too expensive, and service is mostly poor due to staffing problems. We ordered a pepper crab. The waiter informed us that all the srilankan crabs were only 900gms. So he persuaded us to try the Scottish hairy crab which was 1.4kgs. This crab arrived after 4 5mins without claws. When we queried this abnormal dish...we were told that ot never comes with claws. At SGD 80 per/kg this dish was outrageously priced with hardly any meat. Then the waiter said that we must not lose hope and that this crab was capable of laying eggs. Apparently that was the unique selling point! Then we ordered another crab, we were then promptly told that the srilankan in the tank had grown in a matter of 45 minutes from 900gms to 1.4 kgs. The crab arrived 45 minutes later. For 3 adults and three children to eat we were served with a bill of SGD 400. No doubt the maritime view and the sea breeze was spectacular. But ambience service and food pricing was leaving a lot to be desired. We had a table booked but we were not offered it until all our guests arrived. I must say for what it is worth value for money is just not there.
2
After many recommendations to have the chilli or black pepper crab while in Singapore, we settled on this restaurant for a nice dinner. Rather overpriced ($75 for one crab - while fairly tasty, no where near enough food for the two of us), and a table on the waterfront may have been nice, but we were stuck out the back near the toilets. To sum up - $12 for a plate of broccoli that arrived with the rice a full 15 minutes before the crab, less than pleasant atmosphere and a hefty bill at the end was not our ideal night out.
5
Went here for a business dinner. We had one of the private side rooms which was nice. Very interactive as revolving table allows everyone to try a bit of everything. Food itself was the best seafood I have ever tried! Even the small breads was delicious! The well renowned Chilli Crab was well worth its reputation. Can't comment on cost as we did not pay
2
Food is great (and a bit pricey but acceptable for the quality).One incident with the service. I ordered a glass of Tiger Beer Draft and ordered in English. The waitress is from mainland China and mistakenly thought "draft" as "扎/zha" which means a pitcher/jar to mainland Chinese. When we declined to take the pitcher, the waitress came and argued with me that I said "zha" and not "draft" and also tried to force the pitcher on us. Waitress even threatened to bill the pitcher and said "there is nothing she could do about this"
4
This is a great place to dine out in Singapore, out by the Parkway, slightly away from the city area, and especially if you enjoy looking at shipping at night, as I do.One of the other almost unique things that this restaurant does, is that until your dining party is fully assembled and ready to eat, they do not allocate a table. "Ah a party of 6, okay, how many here now? just 2 of you, Okay then, please wait for your friends and I will find a table for you" Meanwhile, we 4 waiting behind them, were shown to a table straight away. There can be no doubting the freshness of the food, but $153.60 SIN for a plate of SriLankan chilli crab seemed wildly excessive, despite the taste. It was an enjoyable couple of hours, spent in the company of good friends, with a couple of jugs of Tiger beer, but for those without expense accounts to forward the bill onto, it was a lot of money, for what otherwise was quick and very basic 'Slap Bang Wallop' type service. I would imagine the ground rental charges on the property are astronomical for the Maritime view, even though they are provided gratis by the ships in the anchorage. I'd always wanted to go there for a very long time, but once will almost certainly be enough for me, l would suggest?Great food and good atmosphere, but disproportionate prices. Tourists beware
3
Went with visitors as they wanted the Chilli Crab. Have been a few times but this time the crab was cold and the prices have become too high for what you get. Dinner for 3 including a cheap (by Singapore standards) bottle of wine and (cold) Chilli crab was S$200. Not a cheap night out as it was a few years ago. Nice venue though with a sea breeze. Will only go back with visitors, not a typical place for locals
4
We had high recommendations to eat at the Long Beach. Was not disappointed with the Chili Crab…beware it is very messy….but very good. Also everything costs on the table, i.e. bowl of peanuts on table when we arrived, small hand towels in plastic wrapper, each bun with the crab. Lots of nickel and dime stuff. Nothing of this was explained to us when we sat down. We expected the crab to cost about S$ 30.00 but was S$55.00.We’d definitely go back if in town, but would arrange for a taxi to pick us up. Location is hard to catch a cab
5
Crab in Singaporean sauce. Shells , the round bread with ice beer can just make it a perfect day. I have never been to any sea food restaurant with so much varieties to choose from, all fresh and mouth watering
4
Our local hosts took us to Long Beach to experience one of Singapore's signature dishes - chili crab - and taught us the proper way to scoop up the yummy sauce with the hot rolls. We saw many, many local families enjoying the food and the views of the shipping traffic going to and coming from the port.
4
We had good chilli crab here, but Jumbo Seafood is better. The crab was also only lukewarm and arrived quickly after ordering, suggesting it was already cooked and they just poured hot sauce on the cold crab...but it was still yummy. Mantao buns also nice and big. My friend had the chilli chicken and it was only OK. Wine is cheaper than in other places in Singapore, and atmosphere watching people walk past next to the sea is nice (but we did see a rat towards the end of our visit). Also they should give you bibs and/or napkins if you are ordering crab as you get really messy and we had nowhere to wipe our hands
4
Met a local friend here for dinner as we were passing through Singapore. First time for chili crab. The food was very good. The setting is a no frills, relaxed, casual eatery, apparently popular with ex pats. Just a good place to kick back with a beer and enjoy some decent seafood
4
When visiting Singapore you must try their most famous national dish - chilli crab. For people who don't like chilli do not be put off by the name - the sauce is sweeter than it is spicy. What I love is the deep fried buns (mantou) that are served with this tasty dish.In Singapore the locals are evenly split between chilli crab lovers and black pepper crab lovers. Personally I love them both but chilli crab wins the race by a pincer purely because it's served with a lot of sauce and you can request extra mantou to soak it up with - whereas the black pepper crab sauce is only cooked onto the shell of the crabs.The mud crabs are large so I recommend sharing 1 between at least 2 people - however the larger the crowd the more meals you can share. This is not just a crab/seafood restaurant - they also serve Chinese meals which are best shared with rice (tze char).When in Singapore you must try both crabs to determine your favourite before a local asks you which side of the fence you sit on! Also enjoy a great tze char experience with family and/or friends
5
OK. OK. So many things have been written re the crab, either in chili sauce or black pepper... For tourists, not a real Singapore dish, crab from Sri Lanka... Etc.Whatever. Long Beach seafood at East Coast Seafood center has the best ever Chili crab one can dream of. Spicy to taste, rich with cilantro (coriander) flavor,and the buns (do NOT forget to order them) are so good with the gravy.Start with some prawns as for appetizer.Forget other location (Long beach has 4 or 5) and come here to enjoy the breeze from the sea while dining. Much better than the cosy interior of other location. Arrive before 7pm or be prepared to queue and wait minimum 30'. That the price to pay. Expect 60 to 70 $ SGD for a crab for 2.Tonight was may be my 15th time there... Cannot stop over in Singapore without having a crab from Long beach seafood..
5
Whenever in Singapore we make the pilgrimage to Long Beach or Jumbo for black pepper crab. It always hits the spot. On this occasion we also had the cereal prawns, grilled sotong (squid) and crispy chicken. In the three years since my last visit a lot of the surrounding restaurants have closed. It's worth the drive - nice at dusk to watch all the container ships out at sea
4
Arrived around 6:30pm to find the restaurant absolutely flat out but we were seated in a few minutes. Ordered the Chili Crab, Sea Scallops and rice and was not disappointed. The crab was superb and the scallops were perfect. The only fault was the Crab order seemed to be forgotten about but when we checked with out waitress she had it on our table very quickly. The restaurant, in fact the whole East Coast Seafood Centre, is looking tired and could benefit from a renovation and a spruce up but still worth a visit.
4
Simply amazing sea food of all kinds from fish to prawns, shells to crabs and oysters. The crab in Singaporean sauce made using eggs was so good with the round bread. One will have to visit this restaurant more than once for sure to enjoy their vast variety of dishes. The shells they served was one of the best I have ever had so far. The ice beer added to make it a perfect lunch for the day. Pick any dish from the menu and you wont regret it. Besides the food, even the sitting arrangement, the ambience , the location was just more than good
5
Came here on my first night in country with some coworkers and let them order everything. Had chili crab, pepper crab, fried rice, some sort of fried squid thing, shrimp, sweet and sour chicken and many more dishes. Yes you can see the water but it was full of cargo ships, not my idea of pretty beach scenes.
4
Went their with friends from overseas (Turkey). they love their chilli crab. Their chilli crab is slightly difference from others whereby i can taste "lemongrass" as one of the ingredient in it. Also recomending their beancurb with floss. Simple but another awesome dish.
3
The food is good, try the black pepper crab (awesome) and the location is nice with a view of the ships at anchor. Overall was a good experience and is an ucon in Singapore so it's worth the visit.
4
Friday eve, loaded with people but we got our table soon although we were 7 people first time visited I ordered small portion of soup which catered 3 Of us. But soups were really yummy. Hot and sour although but tasted very nice. I'm not very fond of sea food I tasted everything which my family ordered and I found them above average as I was travelling and tasting all kind of seafood in everyplace. So I found above average. Service was okay. Crew was just fine they where on theirs wheels to serve us fast. Live creatures- chose to be eaten were okay as I don't like to kill and eat! But I found others were very excited to chose their best crab and other kind of living creatures in those airflow aquariums! But overall hood experience if you like seafood! Live fresh cooked sea creature food
4
Undoubtedly, Singapore has great food. It's the rip-off factor that is the variable in most cases. After paying exorbitant prices at the more tourist-famous places, Long Beach at East Coast Seafood Park is a welcome relief. Still not as cheap as a hawker stall, it's not bad. BUT you can sit in air conditioned comfort or in the open air pretending the cargo ship lights are fairly lights on Christmas Eve.If it's your fist crab experience in Singapore, you'll need to order the mandatory chilli crab (get the buns to dip in the sauce) but for us, the black pepper crab is equal if not better. The fried rice, venison and mee goreng are great as well if you have a group large enough to order the lot. It's not in the CBD, a bit of a taxi ride (15 mins from the centre) but it's worth it
5
Had a simply amazing seafood dinner here while in Singapore a few weeks back. The seating is all open air and food is served pretty much family style. There are prix fixe options, which I recommend. We had a combination of prawns, fish (grouper I think), and the pepper crab that they are famous for. Everything is fresh (they pull right out of the holding tanks that make up the back wall of the restaurant. Out of country fish is flown in daily. The pepper crab is a MUST! Great, local place with amazing seafood...check it out
4
We were initially allotted to table that was clearly too tight but the Assistant Manager Jenny Cheng allowed us to move to a bigger table. Due to a misunderstanding, an order for a whole chicken was placed and once again the Assistant Manager Jenny Cheng graciously allowed to place an order for half a chicken. We ordered the following:1. Sri Lanka crab was full and did not disappoint.2. Poached prawns of good quality.3. Steamed Soon Hock fish was fresh and well prepared.4. Fried chicken is well prepared.The food is overall good and combined with the gracious service by the Assistant Manager Jenny Cheng and her staff, it made the evening very pleasant. Would definitely recommend. We spent around $380 and would say it is value for money. I believe the service culture is greatly improved by having staff name tags as this gives the service staff recognition and improves service. Keep up the good work. If the management of Long Beach is reading this, please pass the compliments on
5
This is how good as it gets. The Sri Lankan mud crabs are cooked either chili- or peppered style. You can't go wrong with either. Before devouring the crabs l, we enjoyed the drunken prawn, which was equally good as the crabs. After the crabs, we had some Merang Pork Rib and yes almost forgot the steamed fish. Wow - this is a true feast that shouldn't be missed
3
usually we always have one crab meal in Jumbo Restaurant east coast during our trip to Singapore . This time , we decided to have in Long beach restaurant -- adjacent to Jumbo We had been to Long beach once more and we believed that Jumbo is better but since we have not been for quite some time , we decided to try once more well -- in my view , Jumbo is definitely superior -- both in taste , quantity and of course value for money How ever , in no way i am saying that it is bad -- it is also good but a shade lower than Jumb
4
I have been to Singapore many times for both business and vacation time and until the past year, Jumbo was by far the best seafood restaurant in Singapore. I feel that Long Beach has now surpassed them in the quality of food, choice of dishes and overall service, plus it's good value for money as it doesn't just target the "tourists"
5
The creator of Chili crab. So must eat chili crab which is a bit spicy but sweet. My favorite food is raw drunken prawn which is live prawn in hard liquor. Red grouper cooked in Hong Kong style is also one of the best in Singapore. Not very kind services though
3
the price is not too expensive compared with its seafront location. Her services are too long and uncomfortable place because it is too crowded
5
All the seafood here is fresh and of good quality. Famous for it's chilli crab and black pepper crabs it also serves pretty much everything else from every type of shell fish. clams , prawns..fish I've never even heard of. Service is not the fastest in the world and it's not the cheapest ...but I dont care...it's a must ! Rui the manager always makes ammends if there is a small comlaint of any kind. It's messy....it's authentic...it's fresh...it's a place you have to go to in Singapore

The food was OK but pricey for what it is. The pepper crab was good but we were convinced that some of it was "missing" - the main body seemed very small. The service was not so good, with all courses arriving at once even though we asked for them to slow down. As a result, the food got cold.Overall, we did not rate this experience as highly as many others have done
5
I used to think that Chili crab was the absolute best thing ever, I was wrong. Long Beach's black pepper crab blew me away and everything else was excellent too. We got there rather late in the evening but the staff was accommodating and truly friendly. Will go back any time I'm back in Singapore.

Known for its Chile Crab and Pepper Crab, it’s a messy eating experience. Crab-lovers in my party did not think it was worth the trouble for so little crab meat. We also had a mix of vegetables and the Prawns with Onions. The taste and especially the sauces were very good. But even the Prawns required work to peel. Skip the fried rice …. It is tasteless. The serving team was good, but our server was horrible, overwhelmed, and incompetent. She even took our take-out bag to the wrong table. I paid my bill through one of the floor managers who seemed far more ‘with it’.Net, if you want the chile crab experience, go once, then decide if you want to do it again. Being a local favorite, you can get chile crab or pepper crab in a lot of restaurants

I've frequented the East Coast restaurants for half of my life and Long Beach especially stands out with superb Pepper Crab and accompanying dishes. Crabs are always very fresh and I just dig their recipe over other establishments. Chili crab is also good, just too messy for me to bother heh! Service is always good as the staff works hard to keep your Beer jugs full

Went to Long Beach Seafood with my husband on a Saturday at 7:30pm. The place was packed. We did not have any reservation, but when we asked how long it will take, the host said 10 mins. However, we ended up waiting more than 35 mins. I did not really understand their system, since they did not even take our name. We decided to wait since it seemed pretty popular among locals. The service was satisfactory, the food was ok. I cannot really tell how good (or bad) it is because I'm not familiar with local food. The dishes were big for size "small". The prawns were pretty good and juicy. However, the bbq fish, which according to the waiter was the specialty of the house, was a little too salty for my taste. Overall, the service and food were decent for the price, but it's a little ridiculous they charge for peanuts and wet towels.Probably won't go back since there are so many other options in Singapore
5
This is the place for crab. They come in from all over Asia, specially, Malaysia, in all sizes and colors. The pepper crab here is the main staple, but you can ask them to prepare the crab any way you want, even when the action is hectic -at night-. In daytime, you get to lunch overlooking the port, the breeze cooling the heat of the day, bliss...It is so wonderful that I even stop for my last crab on the way to the airport. That is being decadent...al the way
2
Singapore has had its day for good cheap foodeverything now is for the tourist dollar.Which is a shame at they have the friendliest locals. Wait until you get home and make your own for a quarter of the price.And as a lot have said you also pay for the wet towel evenwhen our bill was over $140.00
3
We had one night in Singapore and as this place is the home of black pepper crab we thought we'd go check it out. As one reviewer mentioned they pretty much force the set menu onto you SGD118 for 2 people, this was fine as it had prawns to start (yum) pepper crab, noodles and veg. The crab itself was quite dry and disappointing, the rest was okay. What really lets this place down is the absolutely appalling service. There is no way I will be back, I would rather spend my money elsewhere
4
Good food but expensive for what you get served up. Service good and as I said the food was good, but very costly.
3
Wonderful experience sitting facing the sea with friends, in general all the food was good but black pepper crab was dry and disappointing,the flavor did not get into the meat.
4
Overall, the food was good. You also get a membership card and credit towards the next meal if you order set dinner.

We went here because of the good reviews as we wanted to try some crab! The experience was horrible, Service was disgusting and they try to rip you off, charging you for nuts that are already on the table before you get there? We asked them to take them away as we did not want to pay for them as we weren't eating them.. they took our NAPKINS away too!! They were wet wipes , we had one each. They took them because we had to PAY for them.. and there were no normal napkins on teh table at all. They then brought our our crab, without a crab cracker so we had to bash it with a spoon.. then ate it with our hands and had nothing to wipe our hands with. Food was overpriced and staff were very rude. Atmosphere was pretty crappy to be honest as well. Definately think there would be better places around
5
The food here is fantastic. We had the Chili crabs and sweet and sour prawns and it was simply delicious. The best Chili Crab that I have had at Singapore. The ambience in the evening was filled with energy and a large group of people there were having some party celebration there when we went. Large group friendly, amazing food, though didn't quite enjoy the yam dessert. But a must try if you like spicy chili crabs. I am looking forward to trying out the black pepper crabs, the next time I visit it
4
This place is simply amazing!!! A must have is the Singaporean Chilli crab which is simply amazing. I'm a foodie and this dish absolutely tickled every bud on my tongue. Be prepared to get your hands curried because that is the only way you could do this dish justice!!! I have dreams about this dish... that's how amazing it is. Other things to try would be the fried rice with dried seafood and a medley of greens (don't remember the dish's exact name because I was so bowled over by the Singaporean chilli crab) A must visit if you are a foodie!!

I went to Long Beach Main at East Coast Park today for a lunch with my in-laws who are visiting from Italy. Reviews were positive so we were quite sure we would enjoy it.As my in-laws control their cholesterol, we did not order chili crab, instead, we opted for steamed fish- one sea bass, two red snappers. We asked sauces to be put aside.What a DISGUST when we took a first bite. The fish is so TASTELESS. Of course people like it when all they taste is sauce. Try eating plain fish and you would be disgusted. It smelled bad, and there was no taste.I know how fresh sea fish should taste. If it is fresh and has a good quality, all you need to put is just a bit of salt, olive oil and lemon juice and it is a heaven in your mouth. Today I felt crap in my mouth "thanks" to Long Beach MAIN.And the bill? SGD 230 for two waters, veggies (sgd 14), two small bowls of rice, and three crappy fish... Each snapper was sgd 70...Seriously, AVOID IT
4
If you want to eat excellent steamed fish, pepper crab, fried duck, vegetables, fried rice, ..., this place is made for you.As some other big restaurants in Singapore, this place is perfect for family with young children...No need to be quiet, the atmosphere makes it easy to stay with babies.Went there in 2012 and winter 2013 and the food keeps being great and tasty
4
The Black Pepper crab was to die for.. Having said that the restaurant staff is not geared for non singaporean guests as ordering can be a challenge if you are not familiar with the local lingo or the menu items.Overall this place is a must go if you are in Singapore.The choice of beer/ beverages is limited and was a dampener in the otherwise great meal experienc
4
Enjoyed a good evening meal here but came away SGD 200 lighter for 2 adults, 2 children.Crispy squid excellent, biggest prawns we have seen in a long while. Black pepper crab was very good but prices have shot up (prob in line with others at Seafood Centre though).Service pretty swift but didn't feel rushed.I guess everyone has their favourite here but we like Long Beach for the combination of food quality & location with their sea view
4
Another place for good seafood, the restaurant is indoor, air-conditioned, the place is clean. The waitress is very pushy to sell their set menu.
3
The Pepper Crab was really very good, but the restaurant was pretty basic and impersonal. Not sure I would revisit as I suspect there are many better places in Singapore. The staff were as I found in Singapore were very friendly and helpful.
5
We went here on a rainy night for the fabled Chilli Crab and Pepper Crab. Both were amazing. The service was excellent and very attentive. They even gave us umbrellas for the walk to the cab stand. This place is a must visit to have Singapore's Chilli crab
4
The big question here is do you go for the Black Pepper or the Chili Crab? We were fortunate to have both and it was a bit like choosing which child you love more (for the record impossible)... I was never a big crab eater but this was a whole different league. The flavouring of the chili crab and seasoning on the pepper crab was exceptional... And while many of the reviews rave about the crab, I can also say the other dishes (venison, bean shoots, prawns) were all very good. The service is good and the prices pretty reasonable. For sure one of the best Asian restaurants in Singapore
4
Enjoyed a birthday lunch on a Saturday afternoon at Long Beach Seafood Restaurant at the East Coast Seafood Centre.Surprisingly, it was pretty quiet, which is such a great contrast with the crowd at night. Although we did not spend the time walking along the beach, we did enjoy the scenery from the restaurant. Service was prompt and since we had ordered one of the set menus, the food was served quite quickly.The black pepper crab was slightly spicy but super yummy. So if you are not able to take spicy food, you might want to try the chilli crab which is another popular seafood dish. If you do order the chilli crab, then you might want to order the 'man tou' or deep fried buns which goes along very well with the chilli crab sauce.The steamed fish was done just right... very tender flesh which was super delicious
2
I went for Dinner last night with my son and ordered six dishes+rice including two appetizers. I gave clear instructions to the waitress to bring appetizers first and rest of the dishes later on. We received all six dishes on the table within 15 Minutes of ordering. When i asked the waitress her answer was apathetic and simply blamed the kitchen. I asked for Manager and he apologized without looking at me and lifted away the main dishes only to be reheated and served 45 minutes later. There was little effort to make connection with customer and it seemed more like a factory operation, 'take it or leave it' kind of attitude. Food was not bad, but i could not feel anything outstanding as well. I felt i should have chosen a hawker-centre instead where my expectation of service and quality would be lower and I would pay less as well
3
Compared to the Dempsey location, this original does not show well. The food is still good, seafood fresh, but service is spotty, and feels more like an expensive hawker stand than a fairly procey restaurant. Given it's been here a while, and spawned off other branches on the island, it's still an OK experience, just not all too exciting any more
4
We went to Long Beach to try the chilli crab, and we were not disappointed. The restaurant is near the bay, with open air seating overlooking the waterfront. Get ready to dig in and get your hands dirty. Don't forget to order buns with your crab so that you can soak up the sauce. We also tried the cereal prawns. Delicious
4
This was my 4th visit to Long Beach. Each time the service has declined and the prices have risen. It is now a little expensive to go to such a very basic looking place with very bright lighting and little atmosphere .... except for the big fish tanks there is nothing special about the restaurants' dÃ©cor!The thing that is great about this place is that you can be assured of getting fresh crab and fresh hot buns to mop up the chilli sauce. We always have the chilli crab and although the sauce tends to over-power the taste of the crab it is delicious and so are the buns
4
Our last night in Singapore we were taken here by local friends. Longs has a good location on the east coast and it was nice to be able to sit outside by the water. Service was good- and the food was pretty quick. Make sure you check out the full selection of live seafood they have flown in before you choose what you plan to eat. Good place to try the Chili Crab just remember its a bit of work to break it up to eat it
3
Brought a group of overseas friends there. The Chili and pepper crab were ok. Food was nothing to shout about. Crispy squid was burnt and we had to send it back for them to make a new batch.
4
When I'm in Singapore on business trip I always have a business dinner at this restaurant. The food is always good and the service is always excellent.
5
On our way to somewhere else, our taxi driver convinced us that East coast seafood would be much better. Wow. The black pepper crab at long Beach was sensational, worth the taxi ride. Great to sit by the coast and soak up the atmosphere, good service and so glad we took the local advice.
4
My husband and I were recommended this place from a friend. I think had we known how to eat and dissect a crab it would have made our experience a whole lot nice. Don't get me wrong, the food was great. One of the waitress'es even convinced us to get a banquet meal for two - toooo much food. One small chilli/pepper crab plus 1/2 dozen mun toe buns (not on the menu but they serve them) is heaps. Be warned - they charge for the peanuts an use of serviette/napkin on the table. Surprisingly no charge for the bib. About $130AU (scottish clam, prawns, chilli crab, fried rice, dessert, 3 beers)Great view of the harbou
5
First visited Long Beach in 1993 when it had only one restaurant and experienced chilli crab. Since then they have expanded and have 4 or 5 sites. The quality of the food is great and has always been of a top class standard. best meal would be :Drunken PrawnsCrispy ChickenSea Bass ( Hong Kong Style)Chilli Crab with fried buns.We are off to Singapore tomorrow and will be dining in Long Beach two out of the three nights we are there . never miss it !
4
I was here at about 6:30pm and the downstair seating was almost full. By 7:30pm the place was packed out both downstair and upstairs. So advance booking is strictly essential. Chili Crab was super nice, fresh, spicy and tangy. Ordered Penang style Golden Phoenix fish, again very fresh and spicy. Other recommended dishes included steamed bamboo shell and spicy fried squids, all fantastic.The service was prompt and efficient, even though the place was so busy. Waitresses look a bit tired because of they have to serve so many diners at the same time. The only drawbacks for me was the fact that the place was so noisy and there was water leaking from the ceiling. Other than that, this place is highly recommended
4
After lots of research, we ended up dining at Long Beach MAIN and we were very satisfied with our choice. Although lacking in atmosphere, the quality of the food and the service made up for the bright lighting and basic dÃ©cor. We had black pepper crab, prawns with egg and salt and a local vegetable dish, and all were excellent. All the staff we dealt with were pleasant, helpful and professional, displaying great product knowledge and enthusiasm. We weren't rushed and had a thoroughly enjoyable experience. Being Singapore though, the wine choices were very limited and the bill quite high
5
Must try chilli crab (spicy) and buttermilk crab (non spicy). Ordered the set meal $228 for 4 pax. Gotta say, the chilli crab is the best I've had in Sg so far. Others are too tomato-ly. AND the buttermilk is not as heavy as the normal butter crab, but it's packed full of flavor. Can't stop licking my hands. Remember to order the fried buns to soak up all those lovely sauces
4
Booked for dinner but turned up at the wrong Long Beach restaurant. Very busy, but no problem, they could fit us in and cancelled our other booking. As we wended our way through the restaurant, we were a bit concerned that we were going to eat in the kitchen, but no, they took us to a private room that would have seated at least 8 - very big for the 4 of us. The service was really good and the chilli crab exceptional!! Wine very expensive, but it is Singaopore after all! Recommended on our experience.
3
Service a little pushy. Felt like I was at an auctioneers and everything was in a rush for the next crab to be auctioneers. Table cloth and all condiments were removed and replaced as soon as we stood up. Ordered a 1 kg Pepper Crab. But can't seem to think where the 1 kg went.Have had crab a few times and although tasty, missing crab meat and meat wasn't sweat as I remember. Ok for price and efficient, although pushy service. I'm sure there's better
4
This restaurant is always busy and the food is always good but I find the service sometimes very slow and the attitude of the staff is poor and let's the restaurant down.
5
I must admit that I am not a big fan of seafood BUT I have to say my experience here was quality the food and service were very good and if you are a big fan of seafood I would highly recommend this place
5
i love the seafood here. been going here for over 5 years during my nearly trips to Singapore. my favourites are the deep fried grouper in Vietnamese chrysanthemum sauce and ofcouse the chilli crab. the lobsters was very very good
4
Overall good dining experience. Food is good. Service is friendly , however as it was crowded there was a hard time getting the attention of the wait staff. Although, they were always professional in their service
4
Second visit after 7 years and still great taste amazing and a1 for fresh although price was expensive I guess that's the price for the self proclaimed inventors of the pepper crab
4
Very unique, for a bunch of americans that is, for seafood. it started with shark fin soup and worked its way down to the chili crab and finished with some purple sweet potato desert that was delicious.Atmosphere was great looking out over the bay as the sun set. It was crowded so suggest you call ahead, also make sure you get tons of wipes/napkins as there is no way to do it other then get your hands dirty and dig in
4
We had the Chilli Crab and the claypot fish soup. Price is slighlty on the high side but the cooking is very good. Very tasty crab and the fish soup is very unquie Nice place facing the sea a little crowded but no problem finding a seat. Reservation is preferred
3
We went there to try, among other things, their chili crab.We arrived around 7:30pm and without a reservation; the place was very busy with other diners but were seated promptly.We ordered 2 crabs: 1 chili crab and a pepper crab.While prices easily rival the best Alaska flown crabs you can order in San Francisco,the Sri Lanka crabs served at Long Beach are smaller than we expected, but large enough to warrant a "surcharge" of 10% on top of the already high price provided at the time we ordered.This was presented as follows: after we placed our crab orders, the waitress came back to inform us that they were done with the *small* crabs (<1Kg) and the remaining ones cost 10% more since they weighted over 1Kg. Frankly, not having any means of verifying the assertion but having had crab many times before, I am very tempted to believe that this is a tactic used primarily with tourists. The crab was very well prepared but not large by any means.We just paid 10% over the initial quoted price.Note that we experienced the exact same script for a Chili crab the night before at another place.The other dishes were fine, not spectacular.Service however was relatively lacking: we had to request silverware several timesand it arrived piecemeal from a staff that seems to be running around aimlessly.In summary, I had higher hopes. The crab was well executed but the rest left too much to be desired
5
I learned some new things. They have a loyalty program which basically gives you 10% back for next purchase. And second learning is that they can provide excellent customer service. I had captain Jessie this time. Other occasion service was okay. But this time I felt like staff had been on a training course and were on a customer service excellence drive. Continue this and you will attract more foreigners. As always we stick to the Sri Lankan crab with the black pepper sauce. Ask and the waiter will advise you the size and sharing ratio. Same applies to all side dishes and the fish. There are lots more options to try but we stick to our usual. I like the sliced fish with peppers. Specially made for me I think. Ps: there are no serviettes or napkins there so carry your own if you don't want to use 30c wet wipes provided. Got used to this. Wish they one day cancel this and join the modern dining world with same great food. I'm looking for my next visit. Maybe next month
5
I have been here a number of times, and I have always been very satisfied after finishing. First thing to know is that there are a number of outlets, for my money Dempsey is the best. It is more of a restaurant than an outdoor eatery feel, and you are also much more likely to get a taxi than at other outlets, very important when all you want to do is lie down after a big meal!I highly recommend the chilli crab, although the black pepper crab is equally as good in my opinion. One of the biggest mistakes people make is getting a crab that is too small, my advice is to spend the money and get a large crab, you will not regret this decision. The chefs specialty prawns are amazing and are a perfect addition to the crab.If you are still wanting to order more dishes, I suggest ordering the chefs specialties as indicated on the menu. I have done this a number of times previously and have never been let down.Depending on the weather, the outdoor seating in the evening is very nice and a wonderful setting
5
Admire and taste the different sorts of crab, go for the local peper crab or prefer the chili preparation.
Served with nice fresh beer and a friendly efficient service. I didn't pay the bill so apologies I have no idea of the budget.

My wife and I were treated to a seafood dinner at the famous Long Beach Seafood King at Kallang Park. As my friend is a regular, we left him to do the ordering but requested for their famous Pepper Crab and Chilli Crab. Our generous local host also ordered lobster and shellfish and a few other items.The staff were very helpful and friendly. They even went to the extend to remove the hard shell from the claws of the Pepper crab. Both the Pepper Crab and the Chilli Crab were excellent. I preferred the chilli crab as I love the spicy sauce with the buns. The lobster was served in individual dishes. It was indeed delicious. As good as the lobsters we had in Maine. We had the Durian Creme for dessert.Service was attentive as our teapot was constantly refilled. We went on a Friday evening so the restaurant was very crowded. Do make Reservations before hand
4
This restaurant was suggested by a local friend.It is in a nice area called Dempsey Hill, a green hill full of restaurant of several different kind of cuisine.Don't expect a luxuruious environment. the restaurant is simply, authentic and not fancy. But the food is delicious. If possible ask to be put on the table outside to enjoy the breeze.Long beach is famous for the hot crab singaporean style.I suggest as starter to try the famous razor clams with garlic... delicious seafood with garlic temper. Then, as a main corse order a butter sri lanka crab. Ask to have the hot sauce aside, so in case you don't like it, you can still eat the butter crab itself. Specify it, cause usually they serve the sauce together. Not to be missed to accompany this delicious dish are fried buns and rice noodles.it was one of the most simply but delicious meal ever we had in Singapore.Perfect for those who love eating local
4
This is absolutely one of my very favourite seafood restaurants. I have been making my pilgrimage to this great eatery for almost 7 years. If you like fresh seafood, then you have found the place. All the seafood is kept alive in tanks at the back of the main hall and you take your pick – they scoop it out and off to the kitchen. The Black Pepper Crab is a signature dish and one of the best in town – try to get one which is over 1.2 KG as the meat will be firm but juicy. The bamboo clams are also fantastic here and there is a variety of fish, prawns, shell fish etc.. Try the seafood fried rice …. It is so yummy - we also love the Cod, steamed Hong Kong Style with spring onion. The restaurant has several sections some of which are is-conditioned and the other is alfresco. The prices a reasonable considering the high quality of food but it is not cheap expect to pay upward of US$ 45 per head without alcohol if you are going to order any of the signature dishes. The restaurant gets really busy at weekends and a reservation is a must for dinner. When making a reservation make sure you request your preference of air-conditioning or alfresco. The car park gets full very quickly as it is shared with another restaurant so arrive early. If your budget can only allow for one signature dish go for a large ( 1.2 Kg or bigger ) Black Pepper Crab.Service can be a little slow at peak times over the weekend but the food is worth the wait
4
We enjoyed our dining experience because of the quality of the sea food and the cleanliness and hygience at this restaurant. Its definitely value for money - we had ordered prawns, cuttle fish, cray fish, crabs and enjoyed the freshness and the taste of the dishes.. The service was courteous and helpful in selecting our choice of the fish.. They had tanks filled with variety of live fish and it was interesting to see some of them in the tanks which I had never seen before. Interesting place with average ambience but good to visit to enjoy variety of sea food.
3
Food was well presented even chilly crabs was nicely stack up in a plate taste average, cereal prawns which was uniquely their own style not the normal cereal prawns at other sea food restaurants but I preferred the nestum cereal prawns. Kailan with oyster sauce was so so. The good things is the place wasn't too crowded. Was drizzling so cant sit outdoor and indoor sitting with good view to the sea was mainly empty but all reserve
3
Local friends treated us. We arrived at 4:00 in the afternoon and the place was relatively empty.The service at first was great but as the place filled in the service kind of diminished. Some of the dished were better than others but all in all just average. The weather was spectacular and the company was great so still, we had a great time
3
Having carefully booked a table outdoors and planning a re-union with friends we thought that based on previous experience, Long Beach East Coast was a safe bet.However,the trouble started on arrival when the guy on the reception desk told us we had booked an inside table but eventually shuffled us off into a tight sweaty corner outside. Requests for a change were met by a burly and surly mainlander with rude rebuffs which under normal circumstances would have us walking out and especially as several better unreserved tables were clearly available. Eventually we got seated at a decent table (except for the rat shuttling beneath our feet at the end of the evening but hey,he was hungry too) and got on with our meal. The food was of lower standard than usual and served like a conveyor belt as if we were not eating fast enough and had the temerity to be talking to our friends.However the staff were pleasant and obliging as was the Tiger beer lady so we did manage to have a good evening.Cannot help but thinking however that when a restaurant like this is so popular they treat you like cattle to be shoved through a process as quickly as possible and forget that customers pay for some courtesy and expect good food as a minimum requirement.At this rate Long Beach is printing money but it is a long way from its best and no longer a favourite with me at least
4
We went to Longbeach Seafood Restaurant to eat chili crab.The staff were very helpful and assisted us with selecting our food and showed us how to eat chili crab the authentic way-- that is cracking it open yourself and making a hearty mess along the way.We had a great dinner at a fair price and would go agai
4
a great setting and must have is pepper crab. a nice selection of wine and not over priced for singapore standards. service very good and helps teach how to eat the crab. tiger beer lady always ready with more beer. highly recommend and not expensive in total: to get a taxi afterwards takes some time but taxis are chea
5
On our way home from a trip to Koh Samui, we had a 9 hour lay over and were recommended to try the 'Black Pepper Crab' here. The food, the service and outlook were just outstanding.
2
Last month, we went and tried alaskan crab legs for mother's day celebration. Total we were paying about S$900 for 4 persons for the whole meals with about 5 courses and the quality of food just can't make it. The crab was 'soggy' and totally wasted of money for trying it, not worth trying at all for almost S$600 for that particular crab legs dish. Waiters and waitresses were friendly but careless with our orders. Went and tried the less expensive crabs but famous sze char stall in Ang Mo Kio last week, with almost only $80 per crab but with 1000% satisfactory (think it was Sri lankan crabs, ok I knew Alaskan and Sri lankan crabs were off course with a huge different of price, but ...
4
Every time I come to Singapore I must eat Black pepper crab! This restaurant really did it the perfect way, normally people might try chilly crab, but I highly recommend black pepper crab if you like tasty and spicy food. If you doesn't know how to get the crab meat from the hard shell, you may ask the staff to help you
5
It was my 6th+ time here with friends. I was never disappointed. The old staff service were always pleasant. Helped with menu choices and ensured we did not over order food. Sized the crab correctly to share. Just perfect. It's like a happy meal. Pepper crab is he best. That's what I'm told. I just have the fillet fish which costs me one fifth of what I paid at the poor No SignBoards resturant. Can't wait to take more friends there. The prices are reasonable. Enjoy the walk along the promonade.
4
This place was recommended to us by a local. Totally worth the trip on a very rainy day. The decor and ambience is average, but the sea food especially the crab was awesome. Order the black pepper crab if you can handle the spice. The prawn was delicious too. Expensive menu but worth the price, although the thing we found odd was they charged us for the complimentary nuts (at-least that's what we thought) kept on the table and also the wet paper towel we used!The best lunch we had on our trip to Singapore
1
We order a BBQ lobster. It came on a plate with only 2 leaves of out of date lettuce. All the shell was like charcoal and the meat was sticking to it was very dry. I called the assistant manager to show him, and he replied, " it is BBQ, it should be like this" I replied “don't you think it is a bit overdone!!” Reply:" I will tell the chef" and never come back.It is overpriced and overrated. They charge for the peanuts they give you with the beers, we did not get any napkins and they charge for the wet napkins they gave u
5
Right out of the salt water tank came our medium chili crab at my first Long Beach MAIN Seafood Rest visit. We have dined at Jumbo at East Coast Seafood Center on two previous trips and we found the crab at Long Beach to be fresher with a better taste (and lighter not salty) than the chili crab served at Jumbo Seafood. The Chili Crab (with a nice kick) at Long Beach MAIN was pricey but totally worth it. We went for a special occasion and it was very memorable including the mess we made slurping chili crab with large fried buns (better than steamed) and extremely delicious seafood fried rice made with fresh crab, shrimp and scallops. Next time I return, I plan to try the crab they are super famous for, the black pepper crab. The setting was so/so nothing fancy but the servers were friendly and efficient. Tell them you do not want the towels or peanuts because they charge you for everything
4
Excellent, fresh seafood. The chili crab was amazing. The place was packed even at a week night, so it is adviseable to make a reservation. The atmosphere (everything set in very bright light) is as you would expect from a Chinese seafood restaurant. Service was fine and the price-quality-relationship is excellent.Be aware that this oulet is NOT the one where you sit outside with view on the beach, it's the other one further West on East Coast Park, part of the seafood centre. In this respect the pictures on tripadvisor above are somewhat confusing
4
There are lots of other seafood items on the menu and a beautiful view of the sea, especially at sunset. The specialities are of course chili crabs and pepper crabs. And large quantities of beer by the mug, by the pitcher and by the "tower." Seating inside and out, and it is a good place for groups. Even outside, it is non-smoking as far as I could judge on several visits
5
Good Price and yummy. Can choose less spicy if cannot withstand spicy foods. Must order the deep fried buns and take them with the chilly crab saurce. The rice noodles with clams is another must try dish. Avoid the cold water as they taste like tap water.
3
I can't complain about food but they charge too much for it. The table was too small for four persons as nd many dishes. We had only one napkin per person, and as we ate mostly with hands, it became a big problem.
5
this was the best seafood experience i had for ages... excellent service staff and they really adjusted the dishes as per my requirement.. very rustic ... love the food will be on my list whenever i am in singapore
4
Really good restaurant for sea food lovers. Every time I return to Singapore to meet my good local friends we are meeting for dinner will at Long Beach Seafood at East Coast Park. We always get very fresh seafood and excellent service. Highly recommended !!

We dined outdoors at the East Coast Seafood Centre location. Dishes are excellent - bamboo clams, chili crab, steamed fish. View of the water, ships at night very nice, with a nice breeze. Have been here several times, and will most definitely come back again.
3
We had a meal here in Mar 2013 it's popular so advisable to book. We went to try the pepper crab as an alternative the chilli crab we usually order at the Jumbo next door. Maybe we've been spoilt but it's not a patch on the chilli variety. The other dishes we had were OK but nothing special. All the Singapore restaurants we visited seem to serve the prawn dishes butterflied with far too much topping which detracts from the prawn taste
4
We ahve been enjoying the Long Beach Pepper and Chillie crabs for over 20 years. Tonight we had the world famous Pepper crab which was unbelievably good. The Chilie crab which is not my favorite was also good. The service was good but a bit slow on a not so full Monday night
4
Just arrived back from our trip to Singapore and checked my credit card statement.We had 2 crabs, one with black pepper and one chilli crab, one calamari appetizer and a pitcher of beer. We cannot fault the food. It cost us EUR71 and we would probably go back..
3
Having heard a lot about chilli crab we hopped into a taxi to get here. The crab was good, but not worh the price. Also we had to pay for the nibbles and the wipes - I thought that they were complimentary as we never asked for them
3
My husband and I were in Singapore on the last night of a 5-1/2 week vacation, and had heard so much about the famous chilli crab that we took a cab from our airport hotel to Long Beach Seafood hoping for a relaxed, leisurely dinner with a drink and a good meal to end our vacation. What we found was a very, very busy, noisy, brightly lit family restaurant - only beer and wine on the menu. Most shocking, however, was the speed with which our waitress swooped down on us and stood over us waiting for our order. We had been there literally only minutes and had only one menu between us. When I commented that I hadn't even seen a menu yet, she grabbed a second one for me, and continued to stand there, order pad in hand asking what we wanted! As is the case with many Chinese restaurants, the menu was quite lengthy, but there seemed to be no hope of actually reading through the menu ourselves. We mentioned that we were interested in the chilli crab, and she flipped the pages for us, pointed it out and asked if there was anything else we wanted. She finally made a couple of suggestions for side dishes, and raced off. Does everyone who eats here know what they want before arrival?At any rate, on to more positive remarks. . .They brought a dish of peanuts to munch on with our beer (which we thought very nice - this had been the norm throughout Thailand), and soon after that, our meal arrived. The food was indeed very good, though I will say that it is a very messy task to eat chilli crab as it is swimming in this wonderful sauce, and crab must be picked up and eaten with one's fingers. The napkins provided on the table were individually wrapped moist towelettes, and we quickly completely used up the two that had been provided on our table, so we asked for another, which came with a smile and an offer to bring as many as we needed. The staff were very pleasant, stopping by to see how we were doing and were we enjoying our meal, etc.When we had eaten all we could, and decided to head back to the hotel, we asked for the bill. Firstly, the cost of our meal was very high. After more than two weeks in Thailand where food is very inexpensive, we knew that prices were much higher in Singapore. However, it was still shockingly high to us for what we got. In addition, there was a $2 charge for the peanuts, which we had not ordered and had assumed were just a little bonus (as in Thailand at virtually every bar we stopped at for a drink), and more incredible, a charge of 30 cents for each of the 4 towelettes we had used! This kind of nickle and diming seemed completely unnecessary in a restaurant that was already on the high end of pricing. I should mention that we had spent 3 nights in Singapore much earlier on in our holiday, and found lovely restaurants in town with excellent food for much less money, so we did have something upon which to base our comments. So, I came away with mixed feelings about the restaurant. Indeed the food is very good, and perhaps with a group of friends and many dishes ordered, it would have been a different experience. It was not quite what we had in mind for our last night, but if you are prepared for a high price tag, the food was good
2
Took my team out for CNY dinner, and since there were a couple of visiting colleagues, we decided to go for seafood. We like Longbeach Dempsey, but due to the weather, we decided to try their branch at Kallang (near the indoor stadium).As the restaurant was pretty full, we were advised to order the set menu for ten persons as this would be served faster. We opted for the $608 menu. The food was really mediocre, not the usual Longbeach standard, several dishes seemed to have been pre-prepared (thus the speed of the set menu). What was more frustrating was the service, which was non-existent. We had to change the plates ourselves, and had to help ourselves to the cutlery whenever we needed something.We will likely go back to Longbeach Dempsey, but not during the festive season
4
We had a late lunch here. Both the chilli and pepper crabs were delicious with sides of spinach and rice.
It is about 10 or so minutes out of the city but worth it for great food, service and a view.
5
Chilli crab and especially the sauce is amazing. Great selection of fresh seafood, which you can see in large water tanks. Char kway teow is also smokey and tasty.
Seaside setting is pleasant and service is good. Its worth the long ride to get here.
4
The restaurant has a good sea view but if there's no sea breeze will be hot unless sitting in air conditions without sea view. The seafood is good and the service staffs are nice.
5
As tradition we had our black pepper crab, steamed fish and sambal kang kung when we stayed in Singapore for a night. It was even better than we remembered. Still highly recommended when you stay in Singapore. It is always busy and reservation for big groups is advisable
5
It was too dark to see whether Long Beach (the restaurant) was next to a long beach (Changi East Coast). But that's not important. I was there to eat their famous pepper crab. But before the pepper crab, we'd ordered some other local delicacies. One was deep fried bean curd and squid covered in sesame seeds. All was washed down with a nice pint of Tiger beer. Then there were these lovely deep fried white baits. Super crunch. Great when washed down with another pint of Tiger beer.And voila! White Pepper Crab (the crab was of Sri Lankan origin)! Lightly fried and coated with a white pepper sauce. The crab was very fresh (no shrunken meat behind the shells), spicy to the right degree and great with Tiger beer
4
Eaten here many times with family and friends. The chilli crab is only for one off experience but the pepper crab is ordered at every visit. All visitors are taken here to the long beach seafood resturant on east coast parkway at the seafood centre. I struggle to explain what I want and they struggle to understand. So nowadays I just write down what I'm looking for and they understand better. Usually get something close to what I want. The pepper crab is a hit all the time and the fish (ordered using my iPhone memo pad) is runner up. Order sides like bean curd or try the greens in oyster sauce. Very yummy. But one crab can entertain two people. Let them suggest to you. Last weeks visit two ate two pepper crabs. They were smaller ones. Today four ate three pepper crabs cos they where larger. The prices were higher for larger crabs as they charge by weight. There are other exotic foods available. But we only go there for the pepper crab. Hope you found this review helpful. Enjoy your self. Forgot to mention. The food will come at its own time when ready. My fish first. Then the rice. And the grand entrance of the pepper crabs. Once you accept the protocol there, you will enjoy your meals better.
5
Overall, this is an excellent restaurant. Everything we ordered from the fish dish to the noodle dish were superb. I accidentally ordered the chili crab dish instead of black pepper crab but it was excellent! The best chili crab dish we've eaten. I was very tempted to order the black pepper crab after finding out the mistake I made but since we ordered 4 dishes already, I was glad we didn't b/c we couldn't eat another bite. This is a must visit place for great seafood
5
Long Beach is a traditional seafood restaurant, no fancy decorations, but simply, great food. Tried the chilli crabs, mantao buns to dip on the sauce, coffee pork ribs (yes, coffee; very unique), fried rice, and durian pudding presented in a glass bowl with smoke (you can't beat the presentation). Simply delicious! The restaurant is crowded, but we were lucky to get a table outside the restaurant where you get a good view of the sea. We went at night when it is cooler, and the night ambiance was perfect. Service was also very quick, and the aunties (food servers) were very efficient. Can't wait to get back
2
They brought our rice 10 minutes before the main courses. The crayfish were like bits of rubber and worst I have ever had.Complaining got me nowhere, I was just told"they are deep fried". The chilli crab came in a huge dish of gloop. Not the experience I was hoping for and not worth the taxi ride as superior food can be had at Boat Quay or even at the food courts. We were charged for an unwanted dish of peanuts and the tissues. Staff couldn't care less about anything and just wanted to chat to each other. Not the experience I was hoping for
4
Long Beach bill themselves as creator of the black pepper crab dish and serve up a very good Sri Lankan crab indeed. Plenty of restaurant choices at the East Coast Park Seafood Centre, Long Beach is a good pick. Casual dining downstairs with harbour views, air con comfort upstairs. We ate a leisurely late lunch, having a few hours to kill before flying out of Changi: a good location about $12SG/10 minute taxi ride from the airport or Singapore River district. The menu has plenty of live seafood options from all over the globe: these are priced accordingly. A good selection of meat and vegetable dishes for those less inclined to the seafood. House Prawns (shell off) very tasty, as were bean sprouts with salt fish and a beancurd dish. I would pick the black pepper crab over chilli crab every time
5
Well worth the hike out of town. The seaside setting and friendly service are a really inviting prospect, but the Black Pepper Crab really blows you away... Highly recommended
4
Best chilley crabs with black pepper is served here. You can try chilly crabs with normal gravy also. But it surely is a treat to tongue at this place. Sitting next to beach just adds to the overall experience
4
This is a good plae to have pepper crabs , good service they even offer de-shelling services for crabs ordered and nice ambience. Can be very crowded so make reservations on weekends and PHs.
Getting a bit pricy recent years but still worth it.
4
Had the pepper snow crab & it was fabulous. Price is quite reasonable for such good food but service needs to be improved. Bamboo clams was so delicious & fresh we decided to order extra. A great seafood restaurant.
4
We have been there with friends a week ago. The verity of seafood is very large. We had a set menu which includes lobster, chili crab as well as the buns and some veggies. It wasn’t cheap but it was worthwhile. The service is efficient and waitresses are helpful. The restaurant itself and the bathroom is clean, but don’t expect it to be a 5 star restaurant. It is preferable to an outdoor seating. By having beer or other alcoholic drinks, the meal price will double itself. You can brig win from home
5
Simply the best seafood in Singapore (big call I know). Pick your fancy right from the fish-tank in the restaurant. Nice seaside view in East Coast Park, not so cramped as the other restaurants along the beach. We had the Black Pepper Crab, Lobster and Prawns for 2. The bill came to just under $200 and we were stuffed. This will definitely be a regular spot for us
3
My husband took me to this restaurant to try the chilli crab which was very nice. We had it with the sweet buns and Asian broccoli which were nice accompaniments to have with it. The Asian broccoli came out well before the crab and the service was a little disappointing. We did not get any serviettes, and had to ask for some as the crab was very messy to eat. Wear dark clothes and preferably not something good, because it is hard not to splash some of it over yourself. The restaurant was very busy, and the staff worked hard
4
We went to this restaurant because a friend of my husband's told us it was the best. Since we haven't been to any of the other restaurants on the East Coast, we can't compare but it was very tasty.We ordered the must have chilli crab along with some seafood fried rice, steamed green vegetable and a beer and some water and this came to $100 AU. I think it was a bit much since the crab was a small one and the crab itself cost $52.00 we were told. They charged us for two rolls to dip in the sauce and also for the wet cloth for wiping hands.It was an interesting experience but not sure I would do it again. Crabs are lovely but so much work to get a decent mouthful. Maybe next time we'll try some other seafood as they had plenty to choose from. There were glass fish tanks with live fish and lobsters and crabs etc in them and it was interesting that they all came from somewhere else like Canada and Australia.The atmosphere was great, full to overflowing with locals, always a good sign, next to the water watching a thunderstorm unfold and a queue waiting outside not deterred by the weather waiting to get a table.Worth a visit and to be sure of a table make a reservatio
4
Went to the UDMC Branch at East Coast Parkway for nephew's 2 year old birthday dinner. The service was outstanding! We came with a birthday cake and this was received with a smile and quickly deposited in the fridge. The must-haves are the house specialties - steamed live Scottish Razor Clams with minced garlic, chilli crab with fried buns and the live steamed prawns. The food came fast, the plates were changed super-fast (we pitied the people washing the dishes) and the wait staff all friendly and attentive. When it came to cake time, they served the cake surrounded with dry ice and the little birthday boy (and the adults, too) was overwhelmed with the sight of the cake! It was certainly a wonderful birthday dinner

We had an overnight stay at Singapore Airport and just 'had to have' Singapore Chili Crab. The East Coast Seafood area being only 5 minutes away from the airport by cab, it was a no-brainer.We went at peak time on a Saturday evening, so everything was busy. We managed to score a table at the Long Beach, only it was upstairs, at the back, in an annex - so initially pretty poor for ambiance, but this lifted a bit when we left because the noise inside the main rooms was deafening, and the wind outside would have made for uncomfortable dining.We were impressed with the breadth of the menu -- unlucky only if you don't like seafood, particularly shellfish. The Singapore Chilli Crab (and a side dish of noodles) was all that we ordered, because we had seen the size of the servings at other tables. In a word, the dish was superb. Plenty of crab, luscious sauce, and good shell-crackers to get to the elusive leg meat.Service was fast, efficient, and just on the above-average side for friendliness. The biggest downer -- one moist towelette each! With chili crab you need at least a dozen each. A couple on a table near us obviously knew this as they had a roll of toilet paper to clean up with.Would we go again? Yes, but only for the food; not to impress people or for a romantic dinner for two
4
Yummy.... Though the price is high.. the quality and taste of the food served are also superb.. Try the black-pepper crab.. the steam fish also highly recommended.. If you want something "more", order the Geoduck.. Yumm...
5
The service is very attentive and nice. Varities of seafood and the cooking is super... I like the live prawns noodle which very well cook.
4
I went here with 2 friends and we had a pleasant experience with good food and adequate service. We liked the surroundings and atmosphere.The black pepper crab was excellent - juicy and meaty with a nice balance of pepper. We also had some seafood noodles and braised vegetables and rice. All in all, a very pleasant meal at a much more affordable price than a similar meal at the Boat Quay.The service was ok to start with, but got very stretched as the place filled up - beer refills were not coming at the rate required. Some things that we considered ordering were off the menu, which is a bit disappointing for a Saturday evvening. But we enjoyed what we had.The surroundings are interesting - a view out to sea with all the merchant ships moored up. The occasional whiff of marine diesel is not overpowering and adds to the "flavour". Also a walk along the sea front is pretty good to work off a little of the over indulgence.It can be a problem getting out of the place; taxis are not sufficiently frequent, and can result in a long wait. So it is better to stump up the booking fee if you're time is tight
5
We were taken here by a local for a Saturday lunch, he actaully wanted to go to the Jumbo but it was closed (on a Saturday !!).He was not dissapointed and neither were we. The chilly crab was excellent, as was the venison, vegetables, chicken, pork ribs, soup, etc. The beer was even great. The crab was not too chilly hot but still spicy. You should order some buns (not sure what there are called but are used to dip into the crab sauce.If you are planning to have chilly crab, I suggest you wear dark clothes as they will be less likey to show the mess you will make
3
Went to Long Beach in Dempsey and was a little disappointed. The food was ok, service hit and miss and the ever was really expensive. A few good dishes, but honestly preferred Jumbo. Overall, came in at over $100 per head for one of their cheapest set menus, due to the price of drinks. To top it all, couldn't get a taxi home.
4
This is another seafood restaurant chain that we enjoy visiting, especially their eatery at East Coast Seafood Centre. The food is fresh, delicious and quick. Do check out the chilli crab. If that is too spicy, you can order the black pepper or even salted egg version. All are great, especially with the steamed or fried mantous (buns). Do also try the mee goreng (Malay stir fried noodles), and the crispy small squids, which go very well with beer. Reservations are recommended, and a bigger group allows you to try out more dishes. Do be wary when ordering crab though - locals usually get the Sri Lankan crab, which goes for around S$50 per dish. A friend recently ordered snow crabs instead, and that set her back S$400
4
If you take the public bus and get away from the city, you can enjoy a view of boats as you eat a $50 crab. The famous chili crab is about the size of a lunch plate. It is served in a lot of ketchupy sauce. A little too sweet for my taste
5
One of the best dishes I have ever eaten, and I've had a lot!! You can pick out your live crabs and they will cook them up within 20 minutes. Fantastic flavor. Other crab dishes and fish dishes are excellent as well. Great for large groups and small parties alike. Get there early. People watching is fun too. Get a pitcher of Tiger beer and enjoy
4
Went with friends. I think we booked. But had to wait. Squashed into table. Pushy staff who want you to order. Then when you ready they never to be found. Or never come near our table. It's very busy there. Not sure why there's a service charge on the bill. Don't expect too much service. Now taking that into account. You must still visit them. Reason being that their food is super tasty and yummy. Lots of fun to share. Make sure to try the chilli crab and pepper crab. Both were tasty and pepper crab was elected the winner. I cannot eat crab and my fish came 25min later. So I had to watch everyone else enjoy. The claypot fish (aka fish head curry) was soft and tasty. Nearly ate the eyeball :) Overall a fun experience with tasty food. Found it bit pricy but then again, this is Singapore. I will definitely visit again with friends. The beach is next-door if you want to take a night stroll. My friends could not stop talking about the Long Beach Seafood
4
Got a table outside - party of 9 including kids. Ordered baby squid (was not a favourite), chili crab - jummy!! enjoyed the chili sauce with the freid buns - very good and tastyAslo had the special prawns on the meny - not to strong taste, but crispyChicken with fruit sause - very good if you do not want fishLemon chicken - again, a very good choice if you do not want sea foodFish filet with ginger and spring onion - tasty for those who do not appreciate too much chili. Food came fairly quick, but ordering more drinks was not always easy. Some arrived quick, whle others we never got. Had to reorder several times. Will be back
4
Reservation was easy. The reception was friendly.
The food - very good ... especially Chilli crabs with fried dough, steam live fish...
A little pricey but the experience is just memorable and unique.
5
Nothing beats the black pepper crab at Long Beach Seafood. Tourists may be lured by the chilli crab but the black pepper crab is Singapore's best local secret.
4
Serve great food and quality at all times. Will never miss it when we are at East Coast area.
5
There are many places to try Singapores most popular dish and sometimes you think that the chain are just for the tourists but Long Beach at UDMC East Coast Seafood Centre along with all the otherpopularchaina are the freshest , most amazing tasting Sri Lankan Mud Crab you have ever tasted in your life! A big call yeah, but after being to Singapore many times and dropping many hundreds of dollars on this delicacy I can assure you of two things. The Chilli and Black pepper crab here are the best tasting and the freshest you will have on your visit to Singas. Is itcheap lol, far from it I was dining only with my wife and 5 year old son and spent $350 Sing plus $ 150 tax and service which made it over a $500 meal for 3 peeps, but I am a bit of a pig and there was 7kg of succulent crab to feast on. ( 5 kg would have sufficed but I like to take some home for after a few more beers )Service is quite good but hey this is not a fine dining affair at UDMC it's just a place to feast in the best crab, buns and side dishes available , Cold tiger beer and and the side dishes of some nice kangkung and tofu make this place a sure fire winner forme and my family and I would fly to Singas for this dish alone.Get your backside trackside order some crab and you will have a great evening, $49 a kilo for Sri Lankan ( my fav) $200 a kilo for thealaskan king crab
1
I had the chili crab as well as the buns and some veggies. It was a table for two, and the cost was around $80. The waitress was helpful and we ordered what she recommended. Even though the restaurant was not crowded, the food took around 45 minutes to come. The crab itself tasted okay, not as good as expected. It was quite salty and difficult to eat. There were also some sanitary problems. The restaurant itself and the bathroom is clean, but the crab had hair (human) in it, which really turned me off
4
Claypot Crab Bee Hoon... a must at every visit but a 40min wait so be prepared ( i order in advance, so the wait is usually shorten. Note, only the Dempsey branch serves this). Chilli crab, good but i would recommend the steamed buns over the fried ones. Fried baby squid, very good. Trio egg with spinach in broth, delicious. That's it! Not too many dishes, keep focus..
4
Although touted to be a little touristy and pricey, I still think the experience is worth the while, and would be a nice treat once in a while. We ordered black-pepper crabs (only unique to Singapore), drunken prawns, prawn/fish paste in fried dough (you-tiao), and chicken satay.The black-pepper crabs were great, even though they ran out of the big Sri Lankan crabs, the normal ones were equally decent. Beware that the dish could be a little spicy, but definitely worth the try. The crab meat was fresh and succulent, I'm craving for it as I write! If you are a big crab fan, order a small portion of this is, and in addition, also order a small portion of the equally famous chilli crabs. It's not really spicy, and you can specially request for less spiciness. The difference between the black-pepper and chilli crab is that the former is quite a dry dish, while the later one has gravy which you could dip a deep-friend mantou (chinese bun) which is a seperate order.The drunken prawns is definitely another must dish to order. Remember to request the captain/waiter to show the "dunken" process in front of you! What follows is that the kitchen chef will bring out the fresh prawns in a transparent covered bowl with your live prawns, then he will pour a shot of liqour (brandy I think) into the prawns and cover the bowl. Your prawns will be jump a little due to the drunkness, then they are whisk back into the kitchen to be steamed with chinese herbs. The end result is a nice prawn broth, with the fresh prawns. The prawn/fish paste in dough (you-tiao) is a good appetiser if you are hungry to start eating since the crabs and drunken prawns take some time to prepare. It comes with a mayo dip, but I would say leave the mayo dip, the food is good on its own.The only disappointment (I think) that I made was perhaps ordering the chicken satay. The meat doesn't taste well-marinated with spices and is a little bland. The accompanying peanut sauce was equally bland without any real flavour of spices. If you are a tourist would just want to find out what a satay is, then it's ok. Else you are better off in other places.A nice part of the post-dinner activity would be a beachside walk, and hopefully the cool seabreeze will complement your digestion after a heavy meal
4
One of those restaurants you always hope to find in good evening weather: close to the water, informal setting, good service and very good food.My wife met an expat local at a conference. She recommended the restaurant as one of her favourites; otherwise, we would probably not have thought of coming this far out of downtown Singapore.We had black pepper crab (skilfully de-shelled for us), silver fish fried rice and baby kailan with oyster sauce – all delicious with Tiger beer (best to buy a pitcher).We still talk about that evening – it was a joy
1
We got a bill that was not matching what we got. In order to settle the bill I had to call the police and the police stayed until they thought it was safe for us to leave. Nobody should go to this type of resturant if you don´t want to be cheated
4
Just had lunch yesterday with my husband. The restaurant is recommended by the Four Seasons Hotel concierge. Reservation is highly recommended for dinner but it was quiet at lunch time on weekdays. We had a wonderfully steamed live fish, a chili crab that the server even de-shelled the whole crab for customers. It would be perfect for people like me who love to eat crab but don't want to crack the shell by ourselves. The price is very reasonable and impossible to get the same quality in the US. If you're looking for great seafood, this is the place but please do not expect any good ambience since there's none. The serving staff is very friendly and is willing to recommend their good dishes. Would certainly like to go back for their seafood
4
An institution in Singapore. Easy reservations process, attentive service (although not overly enthusiastic at times--robotic), and great seafood.
5
Biggest rice buns, try it steamed, not fried !
And for me their chili crab sauce is the best.
Less people and more personalised service.
5
Tasty and varied fresh seafood, which can you ordered from the aquarium. Prices per kilo. Very friendly and helpful staff! Please note - the restaurant is visited by many people, and this is also the quality score!
4
If there is an eating joint that you need to satisfy your urge for a sumptious seafood dinner, then this is one place you should head for. Book early on weekends as almost the whole of Singapore's crazy car owner population seem to be heading for East Coast to dine. Probably crime fears and horror stories across the Case way have deterred them from visiting JB for the usual cheap and good dinners as well as the traffic snarls on the causeway is cause to pause on any one deciding to eat over the Straits of Johore. Try it for dinner in East Coast, one can take a stroll along the beach walk and look at the dazzling light of ships from every corner of the world anchored off Singapore island, the reverie shaken by the flight of aircraft flying in and out of one of the world's busiest airports
5
My daughter and I were in Singapore in april. The one thing I was adament about was eating the legendary Singapore chili crab. We were recommended to Longbeach by a prominent local bussinessman. We selected our live crab from the fishtank he was in, and had a number of other dishes such as tofu/prawn bites, clams etc.. The food was divine, the chili crab, best ever!! We had fantastic food and service
5
I lived 3 years in Singapore and missing BCP for 8 years. So as soon as I left Changi airport I took a cab for East Coast and choose Long Beach. The black pepper crab was fantastic (just like in my dreams) and the mango pudding was just great ... and all this facing the sea. What do you expect more? For sure I'll come back (just hope not waiting 8 years ...
4
Very delicious and authentic Singaporean seafood. We had .... Steamed royal razor clams which were wonderful , the chili crab delicious but you have to embrace the chilies, black pepper cray fish was the family favorite and lots of fruit drinks and beer to cool the palate . Take a plate of Chinese stir fry veggies to make you feel healthier, and an order of the brown Chinese bread mantou to dip in the sauces instead of rice.While very delicious, be prepared to pay for the quality. Decor was very basic, but the staff was helpful. If you have any cuts on the finger take the plastic gloves they offer to prevent major stinging from the chili sauce! Wear the bib just because it looks silly but it is fun.We went with our daughters and they loved it. A bit further out than the iconic jumbo restr.Be prepared to pay for the quality

Last week eat at this restaurant, quality of thr food was good only the service was pour, at a hawkercenter u get beter service.. Had to wait for more then an 45 minfor the second dish, and we orders 3 times drinks but disnt get any.. So dont go here for business ore dates ore anything because u wont make a good pression.. We leaved and canceled the drinks and the food, never done that before but it was that ba
4
When you arrive, this place looks like it is 'food for the masses' as it is quite big and the decor not that impressive. However, once you sit down, the service is very good and the food is excellent. The staff are very cheery and value your custom
1
First, I will say that the famous chili crab was delicious. No question about that. The price is not listed in the menu. We ordered one chili crab, very normally sized, to split for 2 people, 4 beers & 2 bowls of rice. Our bill was S$97 (the crab was S$65). We thought, pretty expensive, but very delicious. Wouldn't you know a collegue went there on the same nite (with locals) & they were charged S$30 for their chili crab. Their group of 4 ate about 4x's the amount of food we did & their bill was S$140. We even went inside to look at the amazing fish & crab...no prices listed there either. So basically, they make sure you don't really know how much something is supposed to cost. We didn't realize we were gauged until we ran into our friend the next day. I'd also like to add that we are friendly, smiling & thankful americans. We aren't bossy or rude or mean. Actually, we are generally enthusiastic at places like this (smiling, thankful, asking about the local traditions, etc). It's not to say that disrespectful people should get ripped off, however it's really frustrating & leaves a very bad taste to be taken advantage of so severely. Atmosphere is non-descript, "plastic" & a little dirty. Service was just ok. Really put off by price, but again the food was indeed good
4
Good beer, good food, good ambient, nice staff. Resonably priced!
3
Nice chili crab, more sour flavoured than other restaurants. They are famous for black pepper crab though
5
Really good restaurant for sea food lovers. Try the Black pepper crab and/or the Chilli Crab. Its not that cheap but worth the price. You will also probably need to catch a cab to there or bus if you prefer.
5
Every time we return to Singapore our first dinner will be at Long Beach Seafood at East Coast Park. We always get very fresh seafood and excellent service. Highly recommended.
5
Great seafood restaurant. Admittedly I did not pay but the food was really tasty and well cooked.
Rightly so this restaurant is known for its chilli crab, full of flavour and not too hot. The black pepper crab was almost but not quite as good!

We had a "special" New Year meal- Magnificent Chilli and peppered Crab. 10 out of 10.

I stopped by this place for dinner with a co-worker and ordered chili crab. The service was not good, it took forever to ask for anything and actually get it- forget about it. The crab was delicious but come prepared to get dirty, you can ask for plastic gloves, it really helped me. We ordered dessert and it was not good at all. If you come here, order the crab. We paid about 45 per each

Chilly crabs is a must to if you visit Singapore and Long Beach is the place to go if you can afford it. Superb sea food. Live fish and crabs are available to pick. Would be a not crowded during the weekend. Recommends to experience. All kind of sea food available. Largest crabs that I have ever seen
5
Travelling through Singapore frequently, I very rarely miss the opportunity to visit Longbeach. Am usually on my own however have also been there with a reasonably sized group. When on my own this is my staple....A jug of ice cold Tiger beer, a large sized Black Pepper Crab and fried rice with salted fish. I work at my pace and take atleast 90mins to savour the food. No rush and nobody watching me make a mess of myself with a bib, wipes and black pepper sauce all over. Eating crabs are a challenge and therein lies half the fun. Finish with freshly sliced seasonal fruit served on a bed of ice. I walk out of the restaurant without a care in the world. There is simply nothing quite like this anywhere on this planet....Long Live Black Pepper Crab!!

For some time I wanted to try the famous Singapore Black Pepper Crab. Where better to try then the restaurant that created the dish? I was not disappointed.The culture, cuisine and hospitality is Chinese. Many of the employees speak little English, but that does not detract from the fine service and superb food.We ordered both Black Pepper and Chili Crab. Both crabs were exceptionally fresh and prepared perfectly that enhanced their deconstruction.The Black Pepper is as the name would suggest - nicely spiced with various peppers. As the crab cooled, the spices integrated with the crab even more so. The chili crab was saturated in a mild, thick chili that was tasty, and enhanced the flavor of the crab.We also ordered fried rice, and a flat noodle dish with prawns. Both were flavored well with almost a charcoal flavor (no doubt form wok seasoning).All in all - this was one of the better restaurants I have found in Singapore. You will not find fresher seafood. Two of us ate very well for about $100(S).I will return and recommend this fine establishment

Wonderful taste of Singapore seafood. Nice place to go for dinner, without the need to dress up. In fact dress down and wear something dark (so that if you dirty your clothes no one will notice)
4
The restaurant has been around for more than 30 years and I have patronised the restaurant from their humble beginning at Bedok to where they are at East Coast and even has a fine-dining concept at Dempsey.
5
When in Singapore, you must visit the East Coast Seafood centre. I count Long Beach as one of my two favourate there. Order the must-haves: crab (in any way, steam or chillie), drunken pawn, deep fried sotong. Yummy

This is a really strange place. It seems to be run for the benefit of the staff with little concern for the paying customers. When we arrived they tried to put us near the back - we pointed out a table at the front which they then said was OK. We were surrounded by tables covered by what looked to be waterproof covers and assumed they were expecting rain. Half way through the covers were removed to show fully laid out settings. After 10 minutes or so they proceeded to take away the settings and indeed the tables. As customers were eating they proceeded to effectively close up leading to an atmosphere that has was hardly congenial to a night out. This is not a cheap night out either â€“ starters and 2 Sri Lanken crab together with a cheap bottle of Chardonnay came to almost S$220. The bill included charges for towels, tea and peanuts. The 10% service charge seemed almost a joke

I brought my family to the Long Beach Seafood Restaurant at East Coast, the outlet next to Burger King on 29 January 2012 as it was 7th Day of 1st Lunar Month 'People Birthday'.I called the restaurant 4 days in advance to make the reservation as I am aware that on this particular day, the restaurant will be fully booked. There were 2 time slots available, 7.45pm or 5.45pm. I opted for the 5.45pm as my mum usually had a dinner at 6pm.My family have dine at this outlet frequently as it is very accessible by wheelchair. However, I was very disappointed by the service on 29 Jan 2012 as the service staff was rushing us through the dinner even though we were informed that we have to finish our dinner before 745pm and we have agreed to return the table to them by the agreed time.I have ordered the set menu of $528 which come with Yu Sheng on the first dish. Before we have finish tossing the Yu Sheng, the staff brought the sharkfin soup to be served to us in individual bowl. What pissed me off was, not only has they served us the sharkfin soup, they brought the cereal prawn and the clams (elephant trunk clam) together and asked if we would allow them to have the food dish onto our plate! These were done simultantously while we were still tossing our Yu Sheng. Mind you, we took less than 1 minute to toss our Yu Sheng.You see, all the food that they served, i.e. soup, prawn and clams have to be eaten while it is hot and we have not even started on our Yu Sheng.I understand that the restaurant needs the table to turn around so that they could use the table for the next booking but I think this is ridiculous!I have to give instruction to the staff to stop sending more food to our table as lazy susie was full and there isn't any more place to put any more food and the service staff was rushing us to clear the plates on the table so that they could bring more food out. Guess what? After I have instructed the staff to slow down on the bringing to food to our table, we still finished all our food and paid the bill by 7.30pm!I am reconsidering whether I should visit this restaurant after this visit.So, I would advise anyone to go to this restaurant to exercise your right if such things happen while you are dining especially when you have elderly eating with you

ok when you arrive at east coast seafood centre...there is a lot of seafood to choose from and you would be confused to pick which one to eat at... even more tempting when u past by the restaurants and all the food smell nice!! :s so we went to this reastaurant as there was a a table avaiable and ready for us to eat. recommend the chilli crab and order their home made bread!!!! order EXTRA home made bread!!!!! the roast chicken was soft and nice. overall anything you order is yummy.you can ask the waiter for more suggestions based on your liking! :

Partner and I managed a table for Chinese New Year's, so it was busy and hectic as expected. Fixed menu due to the holiday. Outdoor seating is lovely, right on the beach. There is a nice boardwalk which would be great to stroll before or after your meal. The menu included razor clams (very tender and delicious), prawns with hardcooked egg coating (also very good), black pepper crab, and fried rice. About the black pepper crab: I've had it before (outside Singapore) and enjoyed it. But here the black pepper sauce was overwhelming - like a thick black paste. Perhaps that's how it's meant to be, but I think I prefer it a bit thinner and less intense. The crab itself was delicious. I'm glad I tried it (they say this restaurant is the "home" of black pepper crab), but next time I'll try the chili crab... I'd recommend this place, mostly because of the location, but the food was good, too

In the last 3 years of regularly visiting SIngapore, I had yet to have a decent crab dinner :-( Jumbo at Clarke Quay was a fail (poor food quality) and Palm Beach at Merlion Park was a dismal disappointment (long wait for a skinny crab). So to ensure that we would strike the crab jackpot this year, I checked all the reviews on the internet and decided on Long Beach on the East Coast Parkway.When the taxi dropped us off, we were a bit surprised that the restaurant was half-empty but we thought of our stomachs and walked in anyway. We found that there are private dining rooms at the back with people in them, so that was encouraging.We perused the menu for a while, waiting for our orders to be taken. I am glad we did not pre-order drinks, as the head waitress then told us that they were out of Sri Lankan crabs but then tried to upsell us to Alaskan Snow Crabs at over 3 times the price!So we high-tailed out of there but found ourselves miles from the nearest seafood restaurant! We walked ... and walked ... so when it seemed like there was no light at the end of the long dark road, we hopped into a taxi to go to my 2nd choice, Jumbo Seafood at the East Coast Seafood Centre.Moral of the story: Go somewhere with lots of choices in food, don't get stuck with just one restaurant in the middle of nowhere

We took my 81 year old mother there for lunch on her birthday, it was a Saturday and all the other restaurants were either closed or had minimal patrons. I had booked in advance and we got a table downstairs looking out on the beach and ships at anchor.The seafood in the tanks was lively a good indication of freshness.We opted for a set menu rather than agonising over dishes and we were not disappointed. There were three of us and the Pepper crab came beautifully presented and ther was more than one crab so we all got plenty. Drinks were reasonable by Singapore standards. Overall we thought the bill was reasonable given the location, service and quality of the crab.By the time we finished lunch the place was full. Getting a taxi there is okay, coming back into town in the middle of the day not so easy, the restuarant would not call a cab for us sending us to the cab rank

I am crazy about seafood. so I visited there when I stopped over in Singapore. Because I heard it is the one of the best. We looked at the menu and decided to order chili crab for me and pepper crab for my husband and some other sides. After a while we waited older waiter came. when we told what we 'd like to have, he said they are out of stock of the crabs for both chili and pepper ones, they have only Alaskan crab. My hubby said we came here for crab, so let's take it. But i heard he took order of these crab from table nearby, unless they sold last crab to them?! Then I asked how much is it? 400$. How much does alaskan crab weigh? 2 kg something. Oh dear, he almost sell us $800+ for one crab........ I just asked the bill of drinks we had (Beer and fresh juice), snack, wet towel etc. Because I am sure I can find crab in another East coast resto, at least with decent price. I just paid the bill, but one man who introduced himself a manager, said we just stocked with crabs, now you can order. Tada.... within 10 minutes. I want to leave if i am not tired after long flight, and we did not want to jump over resto to resto. I simply ordered a pepper crab, their signature dish. who would order more when they tried to cheat you? but to tell you the truth it was excellent. Next time i will try other resto like Jumbo..
5
the service was great. The lobster served was fresh and juicy. Stir fried deer meat with onion, spring onion and ginger was awesome! The restaurant is clean too. The vegetable and rice, everything was great. One of the best seafood restaurant i visited so far.
5
We were recommended this place by the concierge and it was great - good value too.
4
To have the traditional Singapore Chili Crab....you have to go hear. Great beachside restaurant.
4
The Chilli crab is excellent. Prices are a little steep, but well worth it. The crab is very spicy so if you don't want you nose to run tell them "medium hot." Great ocean views
2
Did dinner at Long Beach with Family. Poor service level and staff are not properly trained to provide a pleasant dinner. Food standard is below par. Just wondering howthey could survive in the competitive seafood arena..maybe too many first time customers. We had Chilli Crab with buns, Herbal prawns, noodle + beef, vegetable dish,none of the dishes were impressive..the most dismal was the noodle+beef.Asked to chill a bottle of white wine..but was ignored..did not bother to pursue..it was a quickly eat and leave situation. A big price tag also for a unsatisfied dinner experience
4
Highly recommended +++++++Great place for a seafood mealBusy++ but casual with efficient turnover of tables.Come for the crab - chilli or pepper - both fabulous Also had a whole fried bream, flat noodles with seafood and fried rice -all delicious.Worth the 10 min taxi ride from Marina Square
5
Singapore is well known for its food, especially seafood, and most well known for its Chili Crab. The best is at Long Beach Seafood Restaurant. I prefer the location at the East Coast Seafood Centre as it's open air and right on the beach. The Chili Crab is so good, delicious, sweet and spicy, makes you want to eat the sauce with a spoon just doesn't give it justice. The Black Pepper Crab is also great. Make sure to ask for the Sri Lankan crab as they have the most meat in the pincers. It's really a must, even if there only 1 night
5
We never fail to enjoy dinner at this famous restaurant every time we are in Singapore. Their chilli crab is good, but as the place that invented the black pepper crab, I actually believe that their pepper crab is better. They use fresh succulent Sri Lankan crabs, the flavor enhanced by the spicy dark peppery sauce around the crab. They also have excellent fried buns if you are going with the saucier chilli crab - best to have both so one can contrast the 2 flavors. We noticed some of the locals get a discount by joining their Premiers club - not sure if tourists can do this as well. There is another Long Beach restaurant along the East Coast Parkway, so when coming in a taxi, do specify that you want the Main Long Beach Restaurant

Chilli Crab at Long Beach Seafood (East Coast) had been recommended to us. We didn't know what to order as the menu was a bit complicated, but the staff were very helpful and welcoming. The chilli crab was interesting and different, but not sure what all the hype is about especially for the price. The waitress broke open and served the crab for us at our table which was a great help as I hate getting too messy fingers!A good experience and a great place if you truly love seafood. Lovely ambience right by the beaches.Unfortunately I was a bit 'turned off' because when I arrived I went to the Ladies Room and there was a waitress there, who came straight out of the toilet cubicle and straight back to the restaurant to resume her duties, WITHOUT WASHING HER HANDS! yeuch
4
We booked in the Main one and ended up in the one at the East Coast Seafood Centre. It was probably a happy mistake as we had an outside table which was very pleasant on a warm dry (as in no rain!) evening. We had Chilli crab the first time we went and Black pepper crab the second. The black pepper crab was our favourite which is not too surprising since these chaps invented it. The food was in all respects delicious! The service was a bit patchy. The first time it was efficient if a little brusque. The second time it was really hard to get anyones attention to order. Mind you the place was heaving with people and we forgave them when we finally got the pepper crab
5
Pepper crab here is the best especially if you ask for more pepper sauce. The crab will be juicy but very spicy that your ears feel deafened! The bamboo clams with garlic is good too.
2
Over priced, very average quality (except the pepper crab which was good), but good views. Expensive beer, which is hawked with gusto.
If want good seafood there are many better places, but the location is lovely on a balmy evening.
5
Fantastic food, get there early though, as the queues soon build up
5
I had my first taste of chilli crab at long beach at east coast. The place is clean, service is good, you can always ask the waiters for suggestions. The chilli crab is sooo sooo delicious! It's not that spicy so dont worry if you're not into spicy foods. One order of chilli crab is about 45, good for 2-4. It's best eaten with frien mantou, mantou costs about less than a dollar a piece. Also tried their buttered shrimp, so tasty. Overall the place is good.

My business partner and I visited this restaurant with a colleague who lives here, his wife, and two you children. First of all, let me say this is NOT a restaurant for children in my opinion. At my colleague's suggestion we opted for a 3 person combonation dinner that they said would feed 4 people and his young children. There was plenty of food and quite a variety consisting of a lobster with special sauce (delicious), chili crab (average), scallops (average), fish (not to my liking) and dessert. It is served on a rotating table and each person helps themselves to dishes that are served one at a time. This place was packed and it had good reviews but for the life of me I cannot understand why and the price...$328 Sing. I mean....are you kidding me? Not for 1/2 the price in my book. The service was OK but we were forced to sit outside at a hastily setup table so the atmoshphere was only fair. I suggest you get reservations early if you want a decent table. This will be my one and only visit to the restaurant chain and the location we visited was the Dempsy street location

First a tip, if you are expecting a romantic restaurant, set on the beach, fringed by palms and looking out to sea, you'll be wrong. True you can walk down to the beach, but this restaurant is set in a fairly utilitarian block, adjacent to a fast food outlet and looking out onto a car park and the 'main drag'.But don't let that put you off. The food here is very good, and the service friendly and helpful. I had the Sambal prawns, tasty and nicely cooked, the Meegoreng noodles, tastily spicy, and their signature dish the Chilli Crab. I was a little disappointed with this, I felt there could have been less (and thicker) sauce and a bit more crab.I had beer and this is reasonably priced, although only by Singapore standards (drinks are expensive in Singapore).A warning though. The complimentary peanuts aren't, and you'll even need to pay for the wet napkins - kind of a necessary with the Chilli Crab I think! And the fact that the crab is 'today's market price' can make estimating what the bill will be a bit hit and miss. Even so I wouldn't say it was expensive, although this is no 'hawker market' bargain.It's busy and frequented by many locals, so I take this as a good sign. The Sambal and Meegoreng more than justified the visit
5
Given the number of people chowing down on enormous quantities of seafood this place is very popular with locals and tourists. Make a reservation. Get service manager Lily Lee to recommend what is freshest and the best that day. You will not be disappointed. The giant crab was so delicious we ordered it prepared two different ways
4
We went for Chili crab, fried shrimps and also oyster. Food is really tasty even was chili to the bones!! Normally I don't eat chili food but this time i coyldn't resist it!! I really enjoyed it. Table was ok on the open area ( with the risk of the rain but layer moved near the umbrella to be secured). we were facing the nice view of ships' queue in the sea.It was nice experience
4
We have been wanting to try crab at Long Beach for a while. Ended up choosing one Sri Lankan Black Pepper and one Sri Lankan Chilli Crab and some deep fried dumplings between the two of us. We loved the Black Pepper version much more as we could taste the sweetness of the crab. The Chilli Crab sauce was too much (in volume) and too sweet in our opinion. Service was quite good - our plates were cleared very often. However, be aware of the peanuts which is NOT free ($2 per small dish) and they do charge for napkins as well ($0.60 per piece)

We went to Long Beach UDMC for dinner today because we were attracted to the large crowds at the restaurant. By the end of the dinner we were astounded by the (lack of) quality of food and sheer audacity of the manager’s comments towards our feedback.Based on the captain’s recommendations, we ordered what he claimed was a Signature dish, some fried Australian lobster. Not only did we find out much later that it was not actually a signature dish (according to their website), but the fried lobster was absolutely dried out, stringy and did not have much meat. And that alone cost us $239.80!We wanted to order a red snapper, which they claimed they ran out of stock of. So we ordered a steamed black grouper ($57.80). This small fish arrived overcooked and rubbery, which is not a state befitting an establishment of this repute. A short while later, a table next to us received a steamed red snapper. When asked about the disparity, the captain claimed that they had just(!) received 2 red snappers with the night-time delivery. Not sure if night-time deliveries really exist, or if he was just trying to throw us off.Scallop with asparagus ($30) was an eye-opener for me. I never knew that scallops could be massacred to this extent- they were bland, with a texture that tasted like what I imagine baked play-doh would be like.The Sri Lankan chili crab ($110 for 2 crabs) sauce was watery and way too sweet, as if the sugar was meant to mask other parts of the crabs. Frankly you’d be much better off having crabs at any coffee shop which sells them.At the end of the meal, we gave the captain our feedback regarding the lobster and fish. He was apologetic but could not do much, so the manager was called in. Although a restaurant manager in the service industry, we think he should take some PR pointers from his Chinese staff. He rebutted all our comments, even though we said that it was more about the poor quality of food from Long Beach than the exorbitant price. The final straw came when we said that we would be writing a review to inform others of our experience, whereupon he dismissed us with a comment that “that’s what all Singaporeans do these days”. All we needed was for him to be at least apologetic for the poor quality of food, but all we got was his thinly-veiled contempt for what he unfairly deemed to be money-grubbing Singaporeans.Although the food and price was terrible, what really got us was the poor service coming from an establishment like this. We have vowed never to return to Long Beach. At least the service in any other place can’t be worse than this

We really enjoy our meal!
Fresh and tasty seafood!
very good !

I had the black pepper crab - good, if forever on the lips. My partner had the drunken prawns and thoroughly enjoyed them. The accompanying special fried rice was a bit dull but we enjoyed the evening and it was far better than the previous evening's seafood at Jumbo by the river. Worth the trip from the city
2
We ordered several dishes but only one dish stood out - the baked scallops with cheese. It was very delicious & everyone was digging out the baked cheese. Nice!Bamboo clams - fresh but I tasted sand in mine. That made me spit everything out. Gross! Chilli crab - just an average dish. Black pepper crab - very very very salty.Fried kangkong with cuttlefish - the fried kangkong was tasty but the very very very salty sauce spoilt everything. The dish was left mostly untouched.Roasted chicken - crispy but dry so it was another let down. Hong Kong noodles - just average - nothing spectacula
4
In Singapore you will a plenty of choices for seafood. But Long Beach is still the best choice when looking at price-performance ratio. Especially as a tourist you don't need the trendy seafood restaurants that are now uprising in Singapore. You can order a set menu and will get served the typical highlights. But if you are in bigger group you get more choices. The onyl bad thing that you have big queue at the taxi stand when returning to your hotel after dinner
4
This was our second time to the restaurant. It's a popular place and we were lucky to be there before eight because soon after a crowd moved in :). We like the black pepper crab, steamed fish (Thai style), sambal kang kung and the tom yam soup. The price for the crab ($45 - medium size) and the price for the fish ($25 - small snapper) are ok. What might be improved is the service; especially when it's busy some staff gets grumpy and seem not to notice the customer. However at the same time other staff stay energized and are happy to help you as much as they can.It might be a good thing to call for a taxi when you finished dinner as the ques might get long for people wanting to return home. The restaurant does charge you for peanuts (what with them anyway?) and the wet tissues. If you don't like that tell them to take it away
4
Already a long time on our list we wanted to eat at the East Coast Seafood Centre. We chose Long Beach based on the recommendations of our taxidriver. We were not disappointed. The steamed fish, sambal kang kun and of course their famous black pepper crab. The food was good and the price reasonable for a restaurant ($60,- per person). We noticed that at the night we visited this was the busiest place and we do have an idea why :-). Our verdict: we recommend this restaurant
5
I was simply blown away by the quality of the seafood and left the restaurant in a food coma. Being a tourist from NYC, I am a novice of Singaporian crabs - the only place you can get chili crabs in NY is Fatty Crab which to my Singaporian friend is sub standard. We had the pepper crab, chili crab, sauteed prawns with garlic, scallops, and more dishes. Both crabs were to die for with each distincitive flavor. The servers even take out the shells for you at the table! What's also great about this restaurant is all the fish and crabs are kept in the water tank in the dining area, so you know everything is fresh. This is officially the best seafood restaurant I've been to in the whole world
1
We took my family for dinner at Long Beach @ Demsey 2 days ago. We usually eat srilangkan chilly crab and black paper there. The waiters with initial W Ng, offered us Snow Crab without stated the priced. He suggested 1 kg of chilli crab n another 1 kg black paper snowcrab. The crab wasnt so good, no meat at all, so we ordered another chilly srilangkan crab.What a post dinner shock, 1 kg snow carb cost us $ 138/kg each compare to srilangkan which usually only $ 44/kg. What a rid off. Usually one big dinner cost us max $ 150 per family, this time we must pay $ 419.Please beware with this rid off practice
4
We visited this place when we were in Singapore this summer.One of our friends who are from Sing took us for dinner there.Though we had an advance booking we did hve to wait for around 30 minutes.However once we were seated and placed our orders the food did arrive pretty fast.The food was delicious.I have to mention the famous Sing speciality pepper crab.It was simply yummy........
4
Over the years we have tried Red House and No Signboard (on more than one occasion) and other seafood eateries whose names we have long forgotten, so we were looking forward to visiting Long Beach at the East Coast. We had crispy sotong, tom-yam shellfish (very good), pork (that was almost an entire joint) and then crab. Pepper crab and chili crab. I am normally a big fan of the latter, the hotter the better, but I really enjoyed the pepper crab. They really do that well. All washed down with draught Tiger is copious quantities (just for the males of the party I should add). We also had fried buns but I think uncooked would have been a better choice for us.No complaints at all. Well, one slight one. The Tiger made me wheezy and that is usually a sign of sulphites in the beverage. So, how come draught Tiger now contains sulphites? It never used to, or in much lower quantities presumably

Another seafood fav

Try to secure a table by the bay for an al fresco dining experience. Great chilli crab.

One of the usual. Chilli crabs !!

We ate at both the Long Beach Main (airconditioned) seafood restaurant at the East Coast Parkway and the No Signboard Seafood Restaurant in the Esplanade. The food at the Long Beach Seafood was better by a mile. We scraped every last drop of sauce from the Singapore Chili Crab bowl. Set menu package worked out to be a great deal, lots of food of excellent quality. Highly recommended
2
I now know why the birthplace of black pepper crab is not known for anything else. I did get the crab and it was wonderful, but the experience was dulled by everything else. My wife's fish was terrible. I was disappointed to see so much of the seafood imported from outside of asia, the atmosphere was poor and the price disappointing. The 'complimentary' nuts we were given at the start appeared as a charge on reciept, along with the napkins that were on the table before we sat down.If you want the famous black pepper crab, go to chinatown instead
5
Reached this restaurant through reviews on the internet. But nothing could prepare me for the very delicious pepper crab. We bought it fresh from one of the restaurant's many tanks. It was sweet, juicy, tender ummm...! The waitress even took out the meat for us to eat ( because we couldn't use the tools properly!). A must try for anyone visiting Singapore. The ambience couldn't have been better too, right beside and open to the beach

Standard but good local seafood

out of all the chili crab i've had.. this ranks in the top 3.

Good chili crab and prawns and those white buns and fried buns.

Great Chilli crab

Still one of the best place for chili crab and other seafood.

love the chilli crab here
4
a good choice for seafood n family gathering...
3
food is ok.. esp the crayfish, but the ambience is lacking.. the aircon is too cold and the family altar is right there in the restaurant, drenching the whole place with incense smoke

Yummy seafood...love the black pepper and chili crab....and of course, the BBQ stingray!
5
Famous for its seafoods delights, especially the chilli and peper crabs. MUST TRY!

love it ... chilli crab !!!

Went to the one that was destroyed to make way for casinos and loved everything I ate.

Food presentation needs to be polished...and man, it's not worthwhile. 3 stars is for the nice seaview though.

Standard seafood fare

black pepper crabs!

the king crab is the best plate ever

I seriously think the quality of the black pepper crabs has dropped quite significantly. We ordered 2 black pepper crabs and to our horror 1 of them was not fresh and meat was only very little ( as in you can see a lot of air in betweent the shells and the meat.) We requested for a change and they change for us, but it was still quite the same
