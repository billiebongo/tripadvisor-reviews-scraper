Expensive. But the signature crab cakes, range of fresh oysters & cold slaw was absolutely first class.

They serve one of the best oysters, shrimp cocktail and burgers! But you need to make a reservation because they are full during dinner. Their oysters are even better than DB BISTRO in MBS, they have a happy hour everyday from 5-7 pm

Went to this restaurant for the fist time. Hesitated going because everyone seemed to say this is pricey restaurant and one even said its about $350 to $500 per head! Checked the menu and it seemed to be rather normal for a restaurant like this. So we just went ahead anyway. Consistent with most reviewers here, food is actually quite good. Heard Steak is very good. Not sure why some people said the Pork Chop is good? I think it is so so. Salad was good though and I heard from a few members of my family the burger is really good. Fries is ok. So overall food is considered good standard. Service is good as well. Good thing is the bill didnt come up to $350 per head but no more than $130 per head even with a couple of beers and a bottle of wine! Would go again for special occasion

Beautiful place and atmosphere. Anything that comes to the table is delicious. The corn bread is fantastic, the oysters the best I ever had in Singapore (with a great champagne vinegar), lobster beautiful, steak tartare to die for etc... Top brasserie food quality, great service. Prices are completely crazy. I'm usually happy to pay for a good meal, but every time (I thought I could somehow grow numb) it left a very sour taste and I am afraid I gave up on this place. And yes, the wines too are priced for the richest PRCs..

Luke’s is an oasis, a joyful escape from the hustle and bustle of Orchard road that never fails to lift the spirits and remind you how great lunch can be. The crisp white table cloths and the light, airy decor immediately put you in a great mood. We had a carafe of delicious chilled Margaret River Chardonnay, fantastically tasty chunky crab cakes with spicy homemade coleslaw, and a kale salad with seared tuna. A real treat

Craved for oysters and just googled in Google maps the closest location. To our surprise, the place is on the third floor of the Heeren mall and is not flashy. However once we entered we realized that we were in good class restaurant. We had dozen oysters, chef’s Ceasar salad and two margaritas. The oysters were wonderful, the salad’s sauce was excellent however we were a bit surprised with pekin cabbage leaves instead of lettuce. We found margaritas a bit strange served in whiskey glasses so we wouldn’t order them again. Overall the experience was wonderful.

visited Luke's on recommendation from a colleague and loved it. Entry is from inside the Robinson's at Heeren, which gave it a bit of shopping mall feel from the outside. But once you enter, its definitely upscale.We had a half-dozen oyster board to start things off. They were exquisite to see and devour.From the chop menu, my wife had a tenderloin steak, cooked medium-rare, which she liked (though she felt the meat could have been softer) and I had lamb chops, cooked medium, which were fantastic. With sides of thick-cut tomato & onion with blue cheese and a glass of red, dining at Luke's was a first class experience
4
Had dinner at Luke's last week with friends. Started with a dozen oysters from around the world, then ordered steak and hamburgers. The steak was amazing, cooked as asked - love the "Luke's" steak knife - which is available to order from their website. The hamburgers were premium. Salads were a little ho-hum. Seemed like they were dressed a little too early and didn't remain as crisp as they should be, but very tasty. The atmosphere is excellent and the staff were very attentive. I'm coeliac and did find the gluten free options very limited
5
Just had my 4th or 5th visit to Luke's and once again a great meal. The oysters are fresh, the seafood cooked to perfection, bar is friendly and service is warm and efficient. Once It may have been bias due to my New England roots, but the nostalgia of having Katama oysters and main lobster in Singapore, has been over taken simply by consistent food perfection and a good relaxing atmosphere. Already looking forward to my next visit

We've been there for lunch on Thursday. We ordered 3 dishes: Tuna Tartare, Stake & Fries w/ lobster tail on side and Lobster Roll w/ Kale Salad on side. Tuna Tartare is superb!!! The portion is pretty generous and seasoned very well, the ciabatta on side is also very nice. This is the star dish❤️. The stake has been cooked medium rare as ordered but the lobster tail is a bit chewy, over cooked, maybe. The lobster roll is also nice. I asked them to put the Aioli sauce on side since I'm not a sauce person><. The kale salad taste nice but a bit too sweet even I've squeezed the lime on it, same as the salad that came w/ the dish. I think the salad dressing here is too sweet for my like. They staff is very nice and attentive. Will come back again to try a burger and a lobster pot pie
5
Visited for lunch.
Had the usual steak fries and salad set lunch.
As always the steak was correctly cooked and ideally seasoned. Love their rosemary flavoured fries as well.
Service remains excellent.
One of our favourites.
5
My friend loves the oysters here, but we had burgers which were fantastic. Not your ordinary burger, plenty of fresh flavors. Excellent service.
5
Nice and quiet part of Orchard Road - it's like coming to this area of peace. Beef and more beef. Oyster and Cavier available. Excellent kale salad. Good service. What's there not to like ?
5
Me and my husband really enjoyed the quality of Oyster that Luke's offer, we are there all the time whenever we visit Singapore. Best oyster we ever had
3
i went to Lukes at Orchard bc the one at Gemmil was fully booked. Ordered the Chop's House Salad, Crab Cakes and Key Lime Pie. The place at Heeren was not easy to find and it was cramped with pretentious people. The waiter got my order wrong even though I repeated twice. The cocktails were nice. The Bill was $315 but it wasn't worth the price tag. Next time just go to Gemmil Lane, it is much cosier and nicer
4
Had a great lunch once we found the restaurant, which is located on the 3rd floor of the Robinsons Heeren Shopping Centre. Cosy setting with a view of the buzzing Orchard Street. We were well looked after by our waiter, who suitably recommended a number of courses. Food preparation was excellent. Rather pricey, but not out of line for similar dining experiences
5
Had a very good meal for my 70th birthday celebration at the restaurant. The starter plate with sea food ala oysters and prawns was great. We also had grilled Pork , Rip Eye Beef and Veal for the main meal. The waiter recommend a red wine, Cabinet Sauvenion, to match the food. Ordered a chocolate birthday cake to complement the happy celebration. Highly recommended for a very good seafood and meat meal showered with excellent waiter service.
4
Overall good food and good atmosphere; in particular the meat was great but the expensive Barolo red wine was very disappointing. Service was homely, and nice but could be more knowledgeable except the fact that the place is quiet busy. Location on the 3rd floor of Robinsons and quiet difficult to find and Brings the fine dining experience down considerably.Overall a very good food experience, some of the best steaks and chops I've had for a while but service and location need to be improvedThank
5
Super lovely dining experience with this location. The Gemmill Lane outlet can get quite noisy when the restaurant fills up but this Heeren location is best for a great conversation over dinner.The food never fails to amaze me - My husband will go for the burgers and I'm also on the crabcakes!Cocktails are superb but they can take a long time to prep, so order them first before considering your foo

But then I guess that's the idea. We want to be amongst our own here and if you put a S$79++ pork chop on the menu, you're pretty sure the lower end of the income spectrum won't breathe on your wine glasses. Joking aside, if you are amongst the lucky people who don't have to count their pennies, you will enjoy Luke's tremendously. Every dish was expertly prepared and deeply gratifying. The Veal Chop (capitals for that one!) was in a league of its own, it has to be said. On the upside, right side of the menu wise, I thought that the wines by bottle had some very decently priced options. We drank 2 delicious bottles of white for just S$100 each, a feat we didn't manage at an Italian neighborhood joint the day after!Yes or No? Definite yes. And you have the added benefit of being able to watch Singapore's upper echelon take out their teenage offspring for a burger without having to darken the threshold of a TGIF.
5
Costly but very good. Great steaks and oysters.
Not easy to find just a simple Black door on level 5 Robinsons.
5
Had dinner last night, had some of their amazing dishes, truly enjoy the tartare, for mains had the pork which is very well cooked! Service wise is efficient and friendly!! Great brownie that is serve with peanut butter ice cream!
4
First and only visit to this restaurant. recommended by family. The mixed seafood: oysters, tuna, lobster, shrimp, etc. platter , a good starter , veal chop delicious, crab cakes were reported to be good,
5
We enjoyed very much the three types of oysters and kale salad. The lobster mac and cheese and the crab cakes were commendable. But the most terrific was the naked fillet which gave the melt in the mouth experience. Amazing how Luke's culinary skill could deliver this. The meal was pricey, but we paid for good food and exemplary service. A classy place to dine with special people.
5
An excellent dining experience in a unique location! This restaurant is located in a leading Singapore department store, but has a genuine NY steak house environment with a menu and food to match. We enjoyed Steaks, veal chops, crab cakes, oysters florentine, etc. along with a great wine list. Outstanding experience
4
Excellent environmentExcellent foodExcellent serviceMenu doesn't offer much in terms of options but they serve well what they offer. And means steak. Good quality steak.Good luck finding it tho, as it feels like it's hidden at the back of the lingerie section. Actually....It is hidden behind the lingerie section.You're better off asking the staff at the mall instead of looking for it.Good joke for the first 20mins of window shopping getting ready for an awesome meal.Food was so good I forgot to take pictures.

Our experience here was really great. This is a small restaurant that, I have to admit, is in a funky location - you walk through Robinson's Dept Store to get to it - but once inside, you won't be disappointed. We sat at the bar for dinner on Sunday and I swear, it felt like we were in someone's very well appointed house enjoying a meal, overlooking Orchard Road as the sun set. The service was attentive. The food, really fresh and excellent. The ambiance was relaxed and you could actually have a nice conversation. Did I say the food was delicious? While spendy - I think it's worth it. We ordered the Luke's burger, the lobster pot pie and the veal chop with a kale side salad and the lobster sliders for starters. And a bottle of wine. Best lobster pot pie ever -- well, my only lobster pot pie TBH, but to give you an indication of the amount of lobster, I took a forkful, thought it was a huge chunk of cabbage but it was lobster. Huge pieces of lobster. Our server had each meal split in thirds so we could each try every dish and it made sharing so much better. We passed on dessert but I'm pretty confident it would have been great. Don't let the location turn you off. Go here ...
1
Do not assume that the restaurant will honor the Happy Hour 'discount' for oysters. We walked away from the restaurant feeling unpleasant as none of our 24 pieces of oysters actually came from the 'selected' Happy Hour special. If there's a difference, the server should have made it known, otherwise, the service charge had been very undeservingly paid. The kale salad, chilled Maine lobster, lobster sliders, crab cakes and desserts were truly enjoyable. The experience leaves a bad taste though I came here knowing I will get fresh tasting oysters

Singapore offers a wide range of food. You can have all kind of Asian, European, and so on food. But sometimes you want to have a steak and then they tell you to go to Luke.You must realise it is American, so forget the European meat knife. Here you get a serrated knife although good meat wonâ€™t need that. We ordered the steak and a glass of wine. It was delicious although not tender
4
This restaurant located at 3rd floor inside Metro Department Store. Very nice and fresh oysters. Nice steak and fish too. I like the coleslaw which went well with the crab cake. Also I like the kale with peanut sauce which really went well with the steak and fish. Service also very good. However, this restaurant is pricey, almost $200 per person without any wine
4
Awesome salad and burgers! Tucked away in the shopping mall and not easy to find, but once inside, attentive friendly service. Pricey!
5
Suitable for chill hand-out with family and friends. My second time here. The first time with the extended family. Both times we were not disappointed in any way by the food or service. Consistency is commendable!
4
i prefer and would try to go to the main branch located near club st - provided you can get a booking. this is more a place i would come to for a drink rather than a meal though,
5
One of the best dining experiences was tonight at the Luke's on Orchard - worth every penny with kind attentive service - enjoyed every minute and longing to visit again
5
This is certainly the best place to eat meat in Singapore. Delicious! This may seems pricey but considering the quality of the food, it's actually a great place to eat! Very tasty!
5
The blue label signature burger is literally the best burger. Having travelled the world and often craving a burger, we still have yet to find one that beats Luke's blue label burger. Though it is not cheap, in my view, it is worth every dollar, and always a highlight of my visit to Singapore! Without listing the entire menu, it is also worthwhile ordering one of the excellent starters and sides with your burger. Make sure you come with a big appetite and try to reserve if you are planning to go during busy lunch hours
4
if you can find this second edition of Luke's then it's a must visit for steak lovers. Hidden at the back of Robinson's dept stop or Orchard Road, with an extremely subtle, nondescript entrance, this place never fails to to impress. Great service and food. The kale salad was impressive as were the sliders and the steak was grilled to perfection. Couldn't finish the fries though. Had been to the original Club Street Luke's a few years back and this one was as good. If you like your moo, then head to Luke's. Never bothered to try the other stuff on their Chop House menu but I am sure it must be all good
5
We ordered the dishes in the title. The food was simply perfect - one of the best meals of this type we've ever had which was a wonderful treat hear in Singapore. Normally the best place to go for this style of food is London, Northern Europe or East Coast US. Luke's is an East Coast US take on the style.The service was unusually professional and attentive for Asia - nicely proactive! We were guided to some wonderful Poilly Fume wine that really complemented the meal.We finished it all off with a mature cheddar - ignore the biscuits and have it on the toasted bread...we liked it so much we had a second serving.This place exceeded our expectations......
4
Craving for steak tartare? In my humble opinion, this has got to be one of the finest in Singapore. Oysters at this place is nice but kind of can find in other locations in Singapore. Veal was a bit too salty for our liking and be ware, portions are American sized.The cream spinach bit to rich.Their Luke's specialty drink was yummy❤️❤️❤️So overall, gave them a 4 star ratings and would definitely go again. Next time, will know how to better order.
4
Went there for dinner on a weeknight and it was pretty busy. Love the cosy ambience and the wait staff was attentive. Had the burger which was tasty and huge. A really cool place for a casual/intimate dinner in the middle of Orchard Road and would definitely recommend it to my friends.
4
Having lived in Boston during college years and loving the food, Luke's is a nice trip down memory lane.The best oysters I've tasted in Asia and seafood done very well.Portions are big so sharing a main course with a few side dishes is recommended.Dessert was just ok.A nice space in busy Orchard
4
Great visit to this restaurant with family and extended family members. Nice ambience and good food. Comfortable seating and great service from Wendy the manager. Steak and oysters were very good. Must visit. Just make sure you don't miss the door which is inside the department store.
4
I used to visit the original Gemmil Lane Luke's for work & biz meals. Now the Orchard one is slightly more accessible. The seats are nice and comfy, although compared to the Gemmil Lane one, this brunch does feel a bit cramped up. I do biz meals as well as personal celebrations here. Food is really good as always. My fave clam chowder in all of Singapore is probably Luke's, and the steaks are always excellent. If you are a fan of the burger, the lunch menu might be more worth it. At this price point, you do get what you pay for, although certain items still feel overpriced. Service is usually pretty good
4
Luke's is located on Level 3 of Robinson's department store- that sounds pretty straight forward. What we didn't realize was that the entrance is a nondescript black door, hidden in a corner, and that you had to walk past the woman's department to get to. Once inside, the ambience is sophisticated and cool, like one of those hip New York bar-restaurants with dark tones, even though the space isn't very big. We were shown the a la carte menu- the prices were not very cool. Prices were mostly above $30- for burgers and rolls. Even the lunch prices felt like dinner prices in good restaurants. We finally settled on the rather reasonably priced roast pork burger ($25) with crackling and jus and exorbitant fries to share ($14!). The burger turned out very good- crispy bun with nicely roasted porky and crunchy crackling, yum! But the salt got a bit too much after 2 bites even though it was tasty. We felt thirsty for the next 3 hours. Fries were nice and crispy but definitely not worth $14, even though it was well presented. Staff were polite and professional. I'd like to go back but seriously, would have difficulty deciding what to order from their expensive menu

Had dinner with my wife and our son and family at Luke's for the first time in April this year. Am frequent visitor to Singapore for business and visit our son. First time at Luke's and it will be one of my first stops next trip. Had the Black Pepper Steak which was superb--the best since they closed the Verandah restaurant of the old Repulse Bay Hotel in Hong Kong many years ago.Most definitely worth a repeat visit. Kudos to the chef! Loved it
1
I took my man here for his birthday dinner and was disappointed. Crab cakes were good but $50 for two pieces. Burger was so salty i was crunching on salt crystals and downing water to quench my thirst. The lobster slides are tiny and cold ( bread not nicely toasted). Only thing is the kale salad and oysters were good. The man thanked me for the thought but vowed not to go back again. Servers were good. But the owner cant put his guarantee on the menu when the food is sub par. I told the manager about the food. He didn't seem to care that much
4
We were told by our KL friends about this place. Yes it is incredibly expensive and as an Australian I certainly would not pay more the $SD 200 for a bottle of wine. Perhaps I would be inclined back in Oz where I know my wines.Notwithstanding this we had an excellent night, two excellent courses each, skipped the wine and sipped on mineral water. Service was outstanding, very professional and certainly nothing could be faulted throughout the evening.Would we go back again next time in Singapore, I say yes
4
We went there for date night a few weeks ago, and whilst the food was excellent, the bill with only one glass of wine ( my partner does not drink) came to $498 which for a steak meal is serious money! Ambience is good, location is weird but adds to the occasio
5
My Partner and I visited Luke's on the 8th April for Dinner. We orders half a dozen oysters for our appetizers and couldn't quite decide which ones to order. Our captain was very friendly and suggested for us to mix all 3 types of oysters that they have for the day so we can taste all of them. A great start to the good service we had throughout the night. We each had a main, tenderloin and burger, and also 3 sides, mac & cheese, fried and kale salad. It was too much food for us and i would suggest perhaps just 1 side to share if you are already having appetizers. We did ask the captain if we over-ordered but she said it was fine. Hmmmm, i wouldn't trust them on that, cause it was way too much food when everything was presented on our table. Food quality was good, no complaints at all. However, some of the dishes are a little more pricey and i am not very sure if they are well worth the price you are paying for. I wouldn't order the burger again actually, the rest was fine. We also had a wine and a cocktail and it was good. The total bill for 2 pax came up to about $315. We had 1 appetizer, 2 mains, 2 drinks and 3 sides. It was way more than sufficient. order a little less and i suppose the bill for 2 wouldn't exceed $300. Restaurant ambiance was lovely, small place with about 50 seats. Which means the service was really prompt and warm. Location is inside Robinsons, and you might need to navigate around a little. Overall, we had a good time with the service and good quality
4
As others have noted, an odd location. But well worth the effort. We dropped in for some oysters and a glass of wine, but decided to stay for a full meal. Staff were excellent, discreet and knowledgable. Pot pie and lobster mac both beautifully done and filling, and the oyster selection erudite and well done. Amazing, but not cheap. You get what you pay for however. Will return.
5
Took my wife here for a mid week bite to eat. Bit of a strange location (hidden away at the back of a department store). Very nice staff, great food. We will be back.
5
The name says it all! Oysters! What an absolute oyster feast this place is! Great variety of oysters and even the oyster happy hour oysters were superb! Anyone enjoying oysters should have been here at least once.
5
From the moment you enter, throughout dining and all the way until the end of the meal, everything was perfect and I always order the same combination of food and to end it off with Warm Cookies and the Milkshake with a hint of stout. Absolute heaven!The attention provided was always just right. Always a favourite spot for dinner
5
Had an issue with my dessert and not only was my bill waved, they let us try different whisky and cocktails which were amazaballs! Never have I ever walk out of a restaurant without paying. After such a pleasant experience, we went back the next week and it was once again - amazing. Freshest oysters I've never tasted
5
Nice little restaurant tucked away in the middle of Robinsons. Rather impressed by the set up as I stepped in through the doors. Not a very big place and it got rather packed towards the end of our meal. The service there was impeccable. The waiter was very thoughtful as he took our orders, offering to give us a sample of all types oysters they had for the day for our half dozen and then proceeded to split our mains into halves, served on 2 plates for my husband and I to share. He noticed I ordered a medium well for my tenderloin and asked if we would prefer our kurobuta pork to be more thoroughly cooked through as it may appear pink in the middle. Really enjoyed the service there. Food wise, food served was very rich and tasty. Portions are good, not too much and not too little. Oysters are a must-have
5
Fantastic svc and ambience. Location wise: not very prominent but it's alright! The burger was awesome, it was cooked to perfection with a little chargrilled taste. The eggs, (which came at an additional cost), were however quite not worth it. Felt like I could cook them myself at home. The crispy bacon was delish though, enough to send the bf and I to heaven haha! The steak was well cooked to a medium and it melts in your mouth the moment you ate it! Haven't had such a great steak in awhile (the last was at Lawry's). OHHHH and their Oysters Lukefellar! It was so yummy!!! I am never an oyster fan nor do I order them. But somehow i did and there's no single bit of regret!! I had an enjoyable time at Luke's.
5
You'll need a reservation... Not a large place but the atmosphere is fantastic, the service is outstanding and the food is very good. It's expensive but consistently good.This location feels like you're in NYC or any equally large US city. Oysters, gorgeous steaks, lobster & outstanding burgers! Great for a treat at lunch with the girls or date night with your honey..
5
Having been a long standing fan of the original lukes i decided to try their relatively new restuarant in the heeren buildingTucked away behind what appears to be the ladies dress section of robinson's department store it is not the easiest to find. The venue itself is great, reminds me of a new york style bistro with really cool booths. Place was packed but service was impeccable. Not the cheapest place to eat but as a dining experience it has the wow factor. I particularly enjoyed the oysters
5
Discreetly tucked away in the heart of Robinsons in The Heeren is this fabulous restaurant serving top grade steak and fabulous lobster dishes. The tuna/tomato salad is divine - the tuna seared to perfection, lobster sliders cute and tasty. My "naked tenderloin" cooked exactly as specified and the sides - lobster mac & cheese and creamed spinach topped off the meal nicely. Next time I will leave space for the delectable sounding desserts. World class food in a very NYC ambience

we are regular visitors to singapore and usually dine at Woolfgang Pak's 'the cut'.(reviewed in 2014).on this occasion we were persuaded by a good friend with local knowledge to eat at Luke's.the restaurant is a long and bar shaped room.more high end burger joint than fine dining.it was full,buzy and well patronised.we were seated immediately on arrival and taken thru what is a fairly limited menu.the special of the day,written on a board was Dover sole and Maine lobster.aptly,our servers name was 'Fish'.a delightful young lady who took good care of us.we chose a selection of the three types of oysters on offer.chef salad.tuna tartare.dover sole.ribeye steak.creamed spinach.asparagus.tomato and onion salad.followed by desert of a beer milkshake with warm cookies.the oysters and tuna tartare were good,as they should be.(fresh raw seafood can only be good or bad).the Dover sole was perfectly cooked,whilst the ribeye was ok,nothing special.it was served on a cold plate,which was promptly changed for a heated one,when I complained.(nothing ruins hot food being served on cold platters).the creamed spinach was a glob of green leaves floating in liquid cream weighed down by a fried egg.most unappetising.awful! my salad appeared as thick wedges of tomato and onion chunks,with spots of blue cheese sprinkled around the dish.poor! our desert order is best forgotten.Luke's is expensive.the sucker punch being charged $28 for a glass of house white wine.the bill for the two of us came to $482 without drinks,including 10% service.its not our kinda place.next visit will stick with The Cut.the staff though,are professional and very friendly
