Needed a place for dinner as other restaurants were full at the time.
Turns out it they have great food.
Tried the trio BBQ ... duck, chicken & cubed roast pork. The roast pork definitely a must try ... very cruncy skin but soft meat.

Huge selection of food, something for everyone. Friendly staff but when it fill up there are hundreds of people vying for attention.

There is nothing to complain about. Nice food, nice atmosphere, nice location. Me and boyfriend had a late dinner here. Pricey, it is acceptable for the location but food was not that stunning if we call it fine dining!

Each night it looked like it was a popular eating place and was full of diners, so that's always a great sign. Stopped in for lunch on our last day at Mariner Bay Sands.We got seated straight away, placed our orders and they were out very quickly. Service was great and the meals were delicious. Nothing was too much trouble and they even offered us a knife and fork

Terrible, terrible, terrible!!!Bad service, bad food and nothing positive to say!!! We should have known. After waiting at the entrance for 4 minutes to just ask for a table whilst watching staff talking to each other. It just kept getting worse. I had to ask for a wine menu twice and then waited ten minutes before anyone came back to take my order. No excuse as the restaurant wAs by no means busy!!!Food is over priced using poor quality. I swear the seafood was frozen for such s long time leaving a distinct disgusting flavour ..... I very nearly gagged!!!Salt and pepper crispy prawns where you cannot even taste the pepper. I have never eaten such a poor attempt of Chinese food ..... it was such a disgrace!!!! Furthermore the service is the worst I have ever received in Singapore over twenty years!!!Donâ€™t waste your time or money!!!!! Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!!!!

Had our set lunch here yesterday lauriat style. First they served the braised peanuts that i loved so much! Then came the super spicy soup, then the dimsum, deep fried pork ribs, stir fried noodles, braised chicken with cashew and lastly dessert-melin bits and tapioca. All these for S$28, not bad
5
Having ordered the set lunch from helpful, attentive staff, we were delighted with the quality, quantity and presentation of some of the finest Chinese food we've had in Singapore. While it may appear pricey, considering the quality of the food we agreed that it was reasonable and good value for money when compared to some of the other restaurants at Marina Bay Sands

Super Amazing Food ..Jin Shan Restaurant at MBSI had earmarked as a must visit restaurant during my earlier visit of Singapore about two years ago. All because I saw they had a very large selection of items in Vegetarian food. We enjoyed here fresh Coconut water which is very juicy and sweet in Singapore. Their Hot and Sour Soup, Tofu and Mock chicken and also Sweet and Sour Vegi Prawns were very tasty. Will come again with bigger group to order more and try other dishes too. Highly recommended. Also not too pricey.

Decent quality dim sum for lunch. wasn't crowded around 2pm. Good efficient service. but the place sure is warm. Is open air for the most part and the A/C in the entire hotels seems to be under performing. Was happy with my dine except for the heat
4
Nice food but expensive wine (not surprisingly). Service was very good but not much atmosphere. Three of us at a table for 8-10 was awkward
4
Chinese, Vietnamese... You get more than you expect from a hotel restaurant at the lobby. Worthed to try if you are around.
5
Really enjoyed our meal here. The quality was excellent as was the service. Definitely worth a try especially if you are staying at the hotel and don't feel like going out for the night.
1
We had send the food back sooooo many times, I lost my appetite. Words that come to mind are , oily, greasy, cold. Rude service particularly from the manager Liew. Not to be recommended. Better save your money & eat in the food court.
2
We went to this restaurant and they were serving food for 70 DOLLARS I MEAN we're ALL NOT MILLIONARES
Also the service was so bad to the point that I left to go to a better restaurant

My wife and I ordered the business set menu for dinner. It was expensive (S$168/px), but delicious and excellently served. We had a seven course meal, served as we like it -- course by course rather than all the food arriving together.Everything was served at a wonderful pace so that we could savor the flavors of each dish, wash it down with a nice pu ehr tea, and await the next dish. Everything was exquisitely served, with all of the attention to detail that one would expect in a fine dining establishment. We wanted excellent Cantonese food and we got it, although the restaurant advertises itself as also providing Szechuan and Shanghai cuisine. The only reasons I did not rate Jin Shan "excellent" are its location and ambiance. One would think that a "fine dining" restaurant would NOT be located in an open air mall space. While the settings, service, and food preparation were all done to a very high standard, the restaurant is pretty much just a bunch of tables set up on the walk between two of the Marina Bay Sands towers -- no privacy, no quiet, no atmosphere. On top of that, the heat and humidity of Singapore flood in with the crowds and open doors, so it is hard to enjoy your meal without sweating

Innovative take on chinese cuisine. Outstanding preentation. Their fresh crab meat corn soup and seafood soup in a pumpkin were a blast of layered flavours. Jin shan special fried rice and their chilli crab, beans with mince, chicken with red chillies were a treat. Friendly staff. Easy to locate at the lobby level of Marina Bay Sands

Food is average with typical Dim Sum menu with higher than Average prices. Siew Mai is like $8. The porridge is nice and tasty. Other than that. I feel the food is overall average. If time permits, I think walking over to the Shop pest area, Imperial Treasure Dim Sum is much better in term of taste and price

Going for Tsai Chin concert a friend wanted to try jin shan luo food.Reach there was full house, happen someone book half the restaurant for event.No choice got to call Chef Huang my friend. He told me wait a little there be table. So wait, but next minutes Chef Huang show up and told the staff to provide us a table. I felt bad cause I normally call for reservations first. So I thank chef & told chef please cook for us something quick as we run out of time going for concert. (we there 6.15 concert 7.30)Just after we got sitted food arrive. I was impressed. In less than half hour we got 5-6 course meal. So well presented and so tasty. Chef personally brought out the last two dishes. I strong recommend their tim sum .Is who you know and not what you know

You have much better choices than eating here with the same amount of money. Food is nice but all mood of eating are spoilt by the lousy service. They used to be so good.1) probably cost cutting, u see lesser staff now. So you re fill your own cup of tea now. The whole dining, not once they check if the pot of tea needs a refill of hot water.2) maybe due closing time, the 4 or 5 staff were all busy with closing chores.3) dessert was served without clearing the main dishes. Not served in front of you. Just put at corner of our table. 4) they asked us pay bill while we were still eating. Stating due their closing.If you want a pleasant meal, have it elsewhere, cannot be worsed

Fantastic food. The baked cod, the fried chicken with Sichuan peppercorn, both were star items. And my colleagues raved about the sauté beef cubes with black pepper sauce.
Very capable and prompt service. Highly recommended.

We celebrated our fifth anniversary here and we couldn't be more happier we did. Everything was perfect from the second we arrived to the moment we left. Excellent service, delicious food and superb atmosphere. We Absolutely love Jin Shan!

Delicious Beijing duck, great crab dumplings, very friendly service in an exclusive venue. On top of all this, good value for the money (S$110 for 2). We recommend it!

i love the food a lot. this place has the best waiters. they serve the food with a smile. they are so friendly to all. I love them.

Great service, beautiful food
Even in the hustle and bustle of Marina Bay, this is a relaxing setting.
The small dishes are great for two but go for medium size dishes will ensure you roll out.
All the food is great

We ate here for lunch. We started with the vegetarian hot and sour soup, which was very good, at $8 per bowl. We then ordered the ginger and pepper chicken,which was small and quite ordinary. An order of bok choy was $20! The meal started with pickled green beans on our table (we did not order it and thought it was complimentary) and we were billed $3 for it. Extra charges for rice. By the time we were done, we had a bill of $72, and had ordered soup and essentially one dish, plus a side bok choy dish. I have also, relunctantly become a believer in tipping. The service was slow. The main dish and the vegetable dish did not arrive at our table at the same time. We had to ask for the check and did not even receive a fortune cookie! The atmosphere was good; I just think it is overpriced for what it delivers
1
First off, the deal for high tea was misrepresented, and turned out to be WAY more limited than what they visually portrayed it to be. Next, the duck noodles (ordered by another family member) shown on the menu had twice the amount of meat compared to the actual plate, which was tiny and miserable. The cost was far too high for this small amount of food, and for the quality.The 'downlight' of the experience for me was when I asked the waitress if the dumpling do not contain any meat, and she said yes. The menu also did not state that any meat was in it. Turned out that 90% of the dumpling was filled with pork. I did get an apology for that, well, just an apology and that was it. For someone who's vegetarian, this was an unpleasant experience. Will definitely not eat here ever again

The meal was good although I didn't like very much the Shark Fin Soup. Our host recommended it as a treat but after a bowl at the Marina Bay Sands Restaurant the previous night ; I felt I might throw up if I attempted another bowl. Otherwise; everything else was good

Every single item on the menu is overpriced. The food are just average and definitely not worth the visit. Seems like they only cater to tourist and gamblers who are willing to spend money. Nothing much on the menu to recommend.
5
The food here as wonderful and so quick in service. The staff were friendly and helpful. Wine very expensive

Nice food but the price is on the high side. I went abit late (10pm) for dinner and I think the airconditioning is lousy.

Jin Shan is Restaurant on the Marina Bay Sands. It serves only chinese foods as like other chinese restaurant. Nothing special
3
Jin Shan is a modern and elegant Chinese restaurant designed to excite and create an interesting dining experience it has an awkward narrow configuration as it occupies one strip of the hotel lobby's prime estate within the hotel lobby area. The restaurant is decorated with uniquely designed lantern pavilions and private dining rooms. The cuisine presents the best of Cantonese, Hunan and Szechuan flavours. It is a fashionable blend of taste that delights the palates of demanding gourmets. , so packed up with many tables in small area, hardly to move around. While the food was average it was distinct and tasty, wine service was not coordinated and the presentation of food, were the service was terribly shambolic. We had 6 to 8 people attending us constantly and repeatedly asking us the same questions over and over, and yet they weren't attending to the nitty-gritties, Service seemed well meaning but not professional.At the end of the meal, we needed to indicate we were finished for them to clear the dishes. Not what I expect from a top hotel, Expensive but average food, I found the place somewhat confining .Personally, I wouldn't recommend this place for a fine dine dinner

Went here on my staycation. Based near Tower 2 we were also lucky to see some fireworks from National Day parade practice on the Saturday.The ambience is a bit diluted by being in suc h busy hotel and service to match. However, the food was nice enough. Soup of the day was very nice, herbal based so cannot say exactly what was in it, We also had some very nice roast pork and scallops in yam nest basket with veg. Also some chicken in ginger soup, ok but not my favourite

First night in Singapore Marina Bay Sand Hotel had dinner here not very good food very plain ordered 4 dishes only ate one, the rest is not so good disappointed in the taste, However service & time frame waiting for food is really good & prompt.Won't eat here again

You cannot miss this Chinese restaurant opposite Tower 2 of Marina Bay Sands, at the Hotel side. - a must go in my opinion. For lunch/tea, they have char siew (chopped up barbecue pork) puffs with bak hu (pork floss) sprinkled generously on the top. The crust is flaky and delicious, the meat is soft and sweet, the crispy and slightly salty pork floss just creates a divine mix of flavours. A serving of 3 costs just $8! Also, under the dim sum menu, do order their carrot cake - very authentic and goes superbly well with the sambal that the dish comes with; abalone siew mai; mango prawn roll. We just could not stop!I had dinner there the first night, and then lunch the next day as we enjoyed dinner so much. The black pepper beef was fantastic, tender and succulent, just melts in your mouth. It was about $58 for a plate, but well worth it. I think we were lucky to select these dishes that pleased us completely. The service from the wait staff was also to be complimented, efficient and prompt. However, you might just find it a tad too warm in the area

we were there as a group so first thing we didn't like was the space there, so packed up with many tables in small area, hardly to move around to get food filled. The staffs were helpful, good service and attention. Food is delicious with small choices
