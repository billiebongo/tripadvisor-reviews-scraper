The restaurant has a nIce ambience. Serves affordable and interesting spanish cuisine. Great service. Overall a great experience!
3
Staff are attentive but the foods are expensive with small portion. This is my 2nd time tried Spanish foods, I find the food rather tasteless.
5
Came here on a Sunday night and had the squid ink paella, crab croquets and the padron peppers. All delicious. The smoky old fashioned is amazing too - a big thanks to the bartender that looked after us!
4
Nice atmosphere and above average food. The octopus was similar to foc standard and aircon was slightly too cold

I’ve had many meals at Pim Pam - all of them enjoyable - so it’s really sad to write that it’s no longer a recommendation. The tapas is definitely better in many places, and certainly in their flagship Hong Kong street is definitely better. Whilst the food is ok, it’s terrible when cold. Pim Pam has done itself no favours by serving all the tapas immediately in one go... allowing all the food to go cold. The unthinking device makes Pim Pam difficult to recommend, and certainly not a place to entertain anyone

This is a spacious bright informal restaurant off Orchard Road. Service was good, staff was knowledgeable, and the meal experience was pleasant. Most of the dishes were good, but the highlight of roasted suckling pig outshone the rest by a mile! The Mushroom and Crab Croquetas was moist and delicious. Grilled Cauliflower with pine nuts was refreshing with a good crunch. The Paella with squid ink and prawns n squid had a good bite, was tasty but a tad bit too salty. We tried another paella with pork and mushroom - this was lacking in taste and not well received as the pork was tough. The Roast suckling pig was excellent. You need to order at least half a pig. It was moist and delicious, and sufficient for 12 female adults. For Desserts we had lemonchello with merengue - this was zesty n refreshing. The Yin Yang crepe was most creative : Light crunchy wafers with creama Catalan filling - the portion was large, sufficient for 8 persons, if you are watching your waistline. Altogether a pleasant meal experience.

PIM PAM by FOC is a truly hidden gem tucked away at the top of Orchard road. The dishes are all marked with allergy information on the menu, and there is a large selection to sate any appetite: vegetarian, kosher, halal, omnivores, etc. The wines aren’t inexpensive, but they do have a selection that is reasonably priced. And the staff (Justin, at least) is very good about recommending something suited to your taste. Note: if taxiing over there, best to be dropped off at the Orchard hotel lobby then walk the two doors over from there.
1
I would expect food from FOC to be somewhat authentic. However, Pim Pam is not. Dish after dish served, built on my disappointment. Spanish tapas? I don’t think so...authentic it is not - a truly poor attempt at Spanish cuisine. Maybe Pim Pam should consider reconsidering it’s classification of cuisine from Spanish to bar food. I will definitely not be back until this restaurant changes hands.

Pim Pam on Orchard road, at the turning of Tanglin Road is located in the Orchard Hotel. It had the option of both indoor and outdoor seating. Inside seating is quite nice with options of big family tables and some high tables next to the window where you can gaze at the Orchard Road traffic. The wine list was extensive but to have only two white and three red options by glass did not make sense. I ordered for the Malbec which was good. For the tapas I ordered bread toast with tomato and olive which was good and flavourful of fresh tomatoes. I also ordered for bread crumbs with chorizo and egg which was also good. The goat cheese with peppers and toast was good too. Overall good place
4
Our family love Spanish Food and they make great Spanish food. The branch at Sentosa is very relaxing but this Branch is accessible and parking g I. Hotel is convenient (though expemsive)
5
Everything we had was wonderful - traditional gazpacho, cheesy me!, crab croquettas (this is da best really), patata bravas, pork and scallops paella and a homemade lemondessert. Thank you for the experience of fresh, honest and great food that we’ve thoroughly enjoyed!
5
Great ambience to chill out on a daily basis...great food!! Love their octopus and ham croquettes, along with their meat balls.. recommended!!
3
the staff there were friendly and nice. however the food portion the taste of the food is not to my liking
4
Had a nice dinner with a friend on a weekday at Pim Pam. Liked the food - we had all veg dishes and was not disappointed by the selection. Service was friendly, but could have been more attentive -- I felt like I had to really strain to get someone's attention when I needed to even though there seemed to be a healthy number of staff. I'll return with my husband sometime and try the non-veg dishes
4
The food that afternoon was as good as the last time we were there for dinner. Although a little quiet for business, it was good for an easy afternoon lunch date. I would recommend the octopus dish and also the scrambled eggs, the latter of which you can have with a choice of mushrooms, chorizo or Iberico ham.
3
I am a big fan of FOC in Hong Kong Street and enjoyed my one trip to Sentosa but my visit to Pim Pam was a little underwhelming.It was lunch time and half of the restaurant was closed so there was little vibe. I had the meatballs with baby squid which were very good. I also had gambas al ajillo and the patatas bravas which are unfortunately the same as those served at FOC and are really just fairly tasteless style over substance.I shall give it another go one evening when hopefully it will be a bit busier but on today’s showing it was no more than OK.
5
Having been in Singapore for some time, you get use to some pretty average service. Therefore I was blown away with the service I received at Pim Pam by FOC. The staff were super attentive, and must have overheard me saying I’d want the vegetarian paella for mains, and popped over to advise that there would be a 20 minute waiting time – in case I wanted to order it early. 75% of our party was vegetarian and there was plenty of choice for all. The Patas Bravas, Mushroom Croquettes and White Chocolate Covered Churros were particularly worth raving about. I was also told the Barramundi was melt in your mouth amazing. I would highly recommend it! The only dish I was slightly unsure about was the vegetarian paella (ironic, given the above), but just found it a little too salty for my taste. Overall, amazing service, great recommendations and very attentive and thoughtful waiters
4
We made our way to Pim Pam by FOC for lunch hoping that they served padron peppers. They did and we were very happy with dish, just as good as we experienced in Spain. I also had the Patatas Bravas and the Pump!kin chicken followed by the Classic Churros (very nice). The service was good and staff were friendly but seemed under pressure and didnt give off a really happy atmosphere. I would go back for the peppers and churros
4
This is our second time here and with a toddler in tow. I had a reservation made through the chope app and requested for a high chair. We were very pleased that someone actually did take note of that request and had a high chair prepared with children cutlery and plate. As for food, it’s was a remember. Good quality and tasty. We had the scrambled eggs, trinxat and barramundi. All were well cooked and promptly served
4
Love every dish we ordered. Squid ink paella so so so good... rest of seafood tapas, pork rib were all to die for.
4
Taste of the food is great but portion kinda small for sharing. Remember to pre-order for the suckling pig! Wonderful staff services too
5
I have been to this place many times, and it never disappoints! Apart from a great selection of food and wines, this places is often buzzling with events promoting special dishes and premium wines. Strongly recommend this place for dinners and business/quiet lunch.
1
I had such a horrible experience here I would never ever wanna go back to this restaurant again! We ordered a big tapas where we were told it’s a serving portion for 3-4 pax. After waiting for more than an hour, we were informed that the kitchen did not prepare the food and asked us to order others. This is totally unacceptable and it caused me to have gastric pain! Firstly, tapas are small dishes that couldn’t have taken so much time to prepare; why were we only informed after waited for such a long time and the manager could not give me an answer! He somehow managed to get the kitchen to prepare our food after we made noise and we waited again another 20mins. I was so unwell and in pain and we asked for some bread in the meantime and that took another 10mins to come. Oh come on @pimpambyfoc, are your staff not trained to handle such situation at all? Finally our main dish came and it was such a disappointment. The big tapas was served in a big plate with 3 small pasta rolls which I can easily finish myself, not to say 3-4 pax serving. Food was not that fantastic too. This was meant to be my birthday celebration and Pim Pam ruined it all, thanks for that and we shall never return. If you are really sincere about it you shouldn’t have even bill us for this super unpleasant horrid dinning experience. Would advice all folks to avoid or dine here at your own risk
5
Staff prepared a complimentary birthday cake as I was celebrating my friend's birthday. Friendly and knowledgable staffs, they were able to assist in recommending wines based on our preference and also food. On a side note, I was caught in a jam and arrived later than my reservation timing, they were nice enough to hold the table for me. Definitely highly recommend this place!:
4
I've eaten in the FOC in Hong Kong Street and thought I would try this branch just off Orchard. Food was similar to the original one in Hong Kong Street, still good and tasty. The decor of the place is playful and colourful, unlike the Hong Kong Street one which is probably more simplistic yet sophisticated. The concept of manifesting the key players of the restaurant into the decor is repeated here as Japanese giant kokeshi dolls. My table was unfortunately served by a hispanic looking guy who spoke English with an american accent. Stern face without any warmth or smile. We thought it was his personality until we heard him laughing and joking with the table of white guys behind us. Not going to make judgemental comments here.The other (asian) staff are politely friendly though. While I was waiting for my friends who needed to use the toilet, one of them came over and explained to me the design of the special hanging lamp and kokeshi dolls.Overall it was a pleasant experience
5
Dinner time can get a little crowded so I usually like to go for brunch/breakfast on Saturday/Sunday. Plus it opens at 9AM during the weekend, perfect when you have kids waking up early... the place is not crowded before 12 and the service very efficient. The food is always good. My favorites are the Cheese Me tapas, the squid and the paellas. Best seats by the window.
4
A fan of FOC, I was excited to try Pim Pam. Food didn’t disappoint but I found the service underwhelming - kept trying to clear our dishes even if we weren’t done with our meal. The restaurant wasn’t full so it wasn’t like they need us to eat quickly to give up our table to other patrons. Would’ve been a better experience if we didn’t feel like they were rushing to get us out of there
4
I love the decor and vibes. And the food was great, served promptly after taking our orders. Highly recommend the Pork Balls, if only we had some bread to "drink up the sauce"! My friend loved the Pork and scallop paella, nicely seasoned and tasty. And also thank you for the surprise birthday dessert for my friend! That was so sweet, really nice touch guys. Will be back soon!
5
We went for weekend lunch with a child, and the experience was fantastic. Food was great, Food quality matched FOC, although I am not the best judge of taste when it comes to Spanish. I was delighted to find a bright and colorfully decorated tapas bar that I could bring family in a casual setting, but maintaining style and vibe.
5
Excellent ambiance! Exciting flavors! We would love to come back again and try out the breakfast menu
5
Will definitely be back - this is fantastic food. The pork shoulder was stand out. Lovely service and fun decor.
5
Pim pam was a fantastic experience for my friends and I. The squid ink paella was to die for, as well as the octopus. They have pretty great happy hours deals too
5
nice ambience, awesome food, particularly the octopus. would definitely go back again. drinks a bit too pricey though, esp for average beer, so i won't be drinking there.
5
Great presentation and great food over all, really good dessert and coffee too, will visit again for sure
5
Not to be missed - BEST Tapas on the planet. Staff were so friendly and prompt. We eill fefinately eat here again this trip.
4
It didn't look very promising at first. The music is too loud and the menu wasn't enticing but some friends had invited us while we were in Singapore and we trusted their food taste. To my great surprise I found myself enjoying food that I had never encountered before and it was delicious! Living in Hong Kong we tend to have great food but the ways in which the dishes were prepared was new to me. The octopus was great, as was the unexpected squid ink paella. Next visit to Singapore we're going back to Pim Pam

I have always been a big fan of FOC by Nandu at Hong Kong Street. But I gotta say this establishment needs to be more consistent in the taste department. On 2 different occasions, the food quality is fairly inconsistent (first time was awesome but second time really disappoints in a big group setting). Serving is fairly small for iberico ham and doesn't come with bread (need to separately order). Grilled Iberico Pork (main course) is well executed but the very expensive Pan seared Beef was overdone although we asked for medium raw. Chicken cantelloni was a clear failure as the chicken stuffing was simply too dry.Kids love the churros and we ended up ordering double servings
3
Decent and cosy Spanish place for after social gathering.Colorful and vibrant interior design & furnitures are Spanish-like, which is actually quite unique. Restaurant can get pretty noisy with back-echo during peak hour.Dishes are close to authentic Spanish flavor. Servings are typically small, and diners could easily order more variety for sharing.Vegetarian Paella was a little sweeter and more soupy than expected.Traditional Gazpacho is not as rich nor smooth.PIM PAM Croquetas are nicely filled and tasty. Churros and Pan Con Chocolate were excellent.Crews were pretty attentive and explained the dishes patiently
1
While food was good, service was sub-par. Servers were unfriendly and unattentative. There were ants on our table and servers hastily cleared our table and dropped a dirty knife on my son and almost dropped a plate. We waited for our Churros for more than 30mins after finishing up our mains and decided to cancel it. No apology from the server despite our long wait. Very disappointing.
5
always a good space for food and drinks. never fails with each order :) Lovely service. I feel that the service is absolutely impeccable.
4
Having the recommended items off the menu, the Croquetas and paella was superb. Not too heavy, I would certainly recommend sharing the paella with 2 or more. The other tapas like Octopus Galician Style and Migas was also two thumbs-up.
5
I visited with my wife and a friend. We order the happy hour of 1/2 bottle redwine and small platter first. Then continue with tapas andour highlight was the roast baby pig (seasonal) and a bottleof red wine.
5
Good food, value for money, nice ambience, friendly staff. Love the numerous vegetarian and vegan options. Will definitely go back there again!
4
Ambience was good. Food was nice, be it main dish or side dish. Will come again. But week end seems crowded
5
Service staff was attentive. Food was done in small portions, good for sharing even for 2 pax. Menu items were delicious, exceeded my expectations.
5
Casual atmosphere but impeccable food, great wine list, cocktails and attentive knowledgeable staff. Can't fault this place!
5
Food and service is excellent. Only gripe about the place is that it tends to get too noisy when it gets too crowded.
4
This space has such fun vibes. I especially like the pepper mill lights hanging above the bar. Food is very good and quick to serve. I recommend the octopus Galician style and the squid ink paella.
5
This was certainly the best Spanish meal I have had in Singapore. I went with some friends and we all raved about the food. Having had some great Spanish tapas over the years (my husbands family are from Spain) I can say PIM PAM by FOC certainly are doing a wonderful job at providing excellent tapas at a reasonable price. Not as cheap as Spain obviously but I understand that. I am crazy about croquetas and the mushroom ones here were really good. I also preferred their version of patatas bravas compared to the traditional style. The staff were also good, very polite, one guy was particularly sweet, he may have been new but you could tell he was trying really hard to provide great service. Definitely will be going back
5
Com a Casa. I'm Catalan, this place tastes just like home. Amazing food. There's nothing else I can say. Thank you.
4
Went for a quick and light dinner. Food is really delicious! Although we were hoping to be able to order the yin yang cookie dessert that is available in the sentosa outlet
5
First visit to PimPam and I must say the food and service were great. Every order was served perfectly and tasted great; paired with brilliant service made for a great long lunch!
5
Food was different from other brunch places and service was fantastic. Fish was done perfectly. We will be back.
4
The food isn't quite as special as FOC on Hong Kong Street, but this is a good family-style restaurant with solid food and great service
3
Orchard Road can be a challenging place to find good food at fair prices. Pim Pam is an attractive space, and the staff are very helpful. The service was all quite good.The food is, well, like a lot of tourist traps. Paella with squid ink (SGD 26) is some black risotto with four (4), yes four (4), shrimp and no other seafood. The wines are not good (Malbec tastes like Merlot, e.g.), although at SDG 12-14/glass not so overpriced as at some nearby hotels (think SGD 20-30/glass).But it's a fun atmosphere if you are after some drinks and snacks along Orchard Road
5
I love the space and the environment n the interior lighting of the place. It's is like dining in a museum. The food is really delicious especially the Spanish tortilla. Pare w bloody B is a great way to enjoy Spanish tapas. Will definitely be back again. The rest room is very clean n I like the hand soap. Staffs are really attentive n they clear the empty plates to make sure we have space on our table.

We highly rate other restaurants under this company portfolio (FOC group) and were keen to try Pim Pam. On receiving promo collateral regarding the restaurant offering limited edition 2009 Vintage Joselito Jamon in a special menu we took the opportunity to book. The restaurant is a lot more casual than others offered by FOC, it's probably suited to the Orchard Rd crowds and passing tourists and pedestrians. A great size and suitable for groups. On ordering we were told they were out of the Joselito Jamon which came as a shock considering it was only day 2 of a 3 day promotion. After applying a bit more pressure and advising we had purely booked to try the promotion, it was finally made available to us. Was definitely worth it. I'm assuming they were controlling the portions per day to Ensure they had enough quantities for the entire promotion duration. We did have a late reservation but wasn't impressed with the way it was handled at the start, although kudos to the team for their resolution of the situation. The above aside, the rest of the menu was great, mouthwatering croquettes and small plates, a stunning fish main dish, complimentary wine offerings all of which made for a really enjoyable night. Overall was great food in a casual colourful setting. Not sure if we would return given so many other options and favourites out there, but if anyone is looking for a more informal dining experience in Orchard then I would recommend as an easy crowd pleaser
4
The food at Pimpam is awesome. I dined there a few times during my stay and tried quite a few menu items. I really liked the barramundi fish, gazpacho (which actually tasted as rich as a salmorejo), the braised beef cheeks, cauliflower steak.But the best was the Galician Octopus appetizer. Do not miss it.Unfortunately the service does not match the food awesomeness. I ordered wine and cava by glass. Seems those bottles were uncorked long before, or were left open. Cava had barely any fizz left, wine was oxidized. The wait staff also mixed up the sequence of the dishes I ordered (appetizer after main).I paid with (a foreign) credit card. It seems they automatically charge in the home currency, rather than Singapore $, resulting in an overcharge of 5-6%. They clam they have no control, however the credit card company tells me is their choice. I did not have this problem in other restaurants/stores in Singapore.Go for the food, lower your expectations on service and pay cash
4
Within short span of 6 wks have been here 3 times....their tapas are delicious and unique in its in its interpretation... hope they make the bikini sandwich available in Pim PamThe only dish that was that didn't wow me was the grill cod fish... i think is bacalhau.. traditional Portuguese dish which has a traditionally blend taste. Also wish they gave a little bit more for their house wine like IO Osteria
4
Lots of small tasty bites. Food hot, drinks expensive. The atmosphere was buzzing and it seemed like a trendy place. Service good.
4
the squid ink paella was superb, so was the churros dessert. our waiter was friendly and attentive. we would definitely love to come back :)
5
The food is really good, from the ham croquetas to the arròs del senyoret. Bread with tomato is really good using toasted bread.
The Spanish onelette was also great, in the perfect point of cooking.
4
Lovely place with cheerful deco. Spanish tapas were excellent, especially the meatballs and croquetas. Squid-ink paella was well cooked but didn't like the burnt under-crust. Churros were average. Excellent service provided. Price point was decent. Worth a return visit.
5
Fun restaurant with very good food. The service was friendly and very efficent (unusual in Singapore) The gin based cocktails were also a highlight.
3
The atmosphere was roudy with a group of youngsters who were not able to keep their voices down. The paella was miserably small in portion where we can see the bottom of the pan when they served and it was not what we expected. It was our second visits and probably the last. The sitting position was also not ideal as they placed us next to the clearing station where we can visibly see the left over from others next to our table.
4
Serving was pretty small, but otherwise the overall dining experience is wonderful. They patiently explained their recommendations and asked for our preferences. The octopus with mash potatoes is a must try!Was there to celebrate a friend's birthday & they made sure the cake was sent to the right person (it was supposed to be a surprise). They took the initiative to ask if we need "Happy birthday" words as deco on the plate. I love the personal touch when the staff wished my friend a happy birthday. Pls keep up the good work - you have made us feel very welcomed and valued..
3
Tried 2 types of paella with meat and seafood, quite disappointed as they are quite dry and not as delicious compared to my previous experience tasting this. However the tapas of meat balls, squids and mash potatoes are quite good for sharing over drinks. Churros are great for desserts. Ambience and service is great for large groups. Prices are on high side since Spanish food in Singapore is considered to be unique.
4
Referred by a business colleague I reserved a dinner reservation for a group. The decor is fun and funky. Quite colourful. The atmosphere is alive. The vibe is fresh and alive. Food selection is slightly different tapas than I was expecting but interesting enough to experiment. Wine selection is from various wine regions globally which is great for pairing experimentation. Customer service and vibe is alive and buzzing. Located close to the Orchard Hotel ... bonus.
4
I was impressed with their staff calling to remind me of the dinner and details of their location including carpark charges; even sending an email of the same.The ambience was cozy albeit a tad nosy and tight between tables. Waitstaff were attentive and knowledgeable about their wines.A flavourfully curated dinner by 2 chefs with interesting texture and taste in non-frou frou presentation.
4
Good food at this casual version of FOC. The croquettes were great. There seem to be decent happy hour specials. The menu has a lot of overlap with FOC at Hong Kong Street.
5
Easily one of the best restaurant experiences in Singapore, with first class food, wine and service. I actually rate it better than the original FOC at Hong Kong St, with a couple of different menu options and even more casual atmosphere.
4
Nice atmosphere, good service and attentive staff. Food was definitely tasty, well prepared and fresh. Visited with a Spanish friend who did the ordering for us. Everything was delicious. Definitely end your meal with the churros with chocolate sauce.
4
Great service and attentive staff. Just a minor hiccup at the end with an item included in check which was not ordered. But they immediately acknowledged and rectified the error.
4
The service staff was warm and friendly. Food was tasty, but on the pricey side. Ambience of the place was nice!
2
I visited the restaurant twice last week and the food quality is so inconsistent and the fried potatoes were soaking in oil. Very disappointing as the second visit was to celebrate my friend's birthday.
4
The food was really good especially the octopus and paella (pork and scallop). Churros was yummy ... stuffed churros was too sweet for me though.
5
First time here trying their set menu which don't happen often and am very impressed with all the dishes. Can't pick a slightest mistake on them and the service they provide is also very warming. Definitely will recommend this place to anyone that have a crave for Spanish foo
5
We stayed at the Orchard Hotel and visited Pim Pam's twice. Once on a Saturday night-which was really busy-when we met with one of the partner's, his son and his father. The food and atmosphere were great, Our second visit was on a Wednesday night which was busy but not crazy. We recommend the paella with pork and scallops-which was as good as anywhere we have eaten, the goats cheese and pimento and the octopus. This restaurant is well worth a visit
5
We had lunch at Pim Pams and enjoyed the tapas menu - a delicious, high standard range of foods that we couldn't fault.It also one of only a handful of places that got the tick of approval from our coffee aficionados (who had searched far and wide)
4
Good place for a casual date or for groups. Food is good , don't expect the quality of ingredients like FOC. Overall good experience
5
Food: Good choice and delicious.
Service: Warm and friendly. Happy to make recommendations when asked.
Atmosphere: Brilliant - even on a Tuesday night.
4
Very nice and friendly staff, just that music was a little too loud for conversation. Recommended to order suckling pig!
4
Experience was good, food great quality. However, portions are bit small. The service and atmosphere is really great. I was surprised through that the kitchen closes around 10pm.
5
Mouthful after mouthful of the most delicious dishes ever! We ordered a wide range of tapas and loved everything. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in Singapore.
4
Service is superb. The drinks are just perfect. Food is nice but can be improved. But as a casual dining and Tapas bar you can't get better especially on busy Orchard road. Good seating options and quite.
4
Pim Pam by FOC’s name apparently means quick and easy. Their food is indeed quick, not sure if that easy to cook but food and service are certainly good.The restaurant is very pleasantly decorated and there appears to be several seating areas including a bar seating and even a private dining area when the curtains are drawn.Quick and easy probably refers to them serving tapas. Their Patatas Bravas is a very interesting potato dish made into a mille-feuille with squirts of salsa and aioli. Leek It is a healthy serving of leek roasted with rocket served with a soya cream, almonds slices and slivers of anchovies. I was very impressed with the chef’s special that day, the Cauliflower Steak: cut horizontally with the “flowers” intact and then char grilled. It may have been blanched as the cauliflower was unusually soft. The Barramundi was pan fried served on top of yummy confit potatoes: yet another clever preparation of the humble potato. The Octopus was cooked gently sans the chewiness and served on top of potatoes, this time simply mashed. Did we really have so many potato dishes? But I wasn’t complaining. We rounded off our lunch with the quintessential churros dipped in thick chocolate.Service complemented the food and ambience: very nice, from the maître d’, waiters and waitresses to the managers. The kitchen is open so you could see how the sou chef checks each dish and plating before they are served. When coming around for the last order, the waitress took the trouble to see what else was in the order and reminded us. Nice to know that they are watching out for us versus having to remind them.If you are in the mood for sharing – family style - a western meal of small dishes, you must try Pim Pam. Speaking of which, I now wonder if Pim Pam rhymes with (and inspired) by Dim Sum
5
Approachable and friendly staff! Celebrated my friend's birthday and we enjoyed tasting the cocktails; even learnt what goes into each concoction. And we got the octopus and crab croquettes which we really enjoyed! Paella was good... But I concur with the other reviews that there wasn't enough of it :
4
i've been wanting to try FOC for a while since hearing good reviews from friends. haven't yet but tried pim pam and will certainly go back. tapas restaurant in a bright happy space - nicely located on the corner of orchard and orange grove road, bright decor and large glass windows looking out. the sangrias were good and so was the food - especially the barramundi, the prawns in garlic and olive oil, the leek salad with anchovies and the simple flavourful padron peppers. overall a happy experience, one that i will replicate to try other items on the menu.the paella was interesting - spread thin on a baking tray but the squid in it was a bit chewy and i wasn't too keen on the pork belly and octopus skewers but they weren't bad - just not as nice as the other dishes
3
Went to Pim Pam for the second time after having a pleasant experience the week before. This time the overall experience was poor. We had a waiter who was more insistent on describing what he liked rather than soliciting the tastes of the group before making recommendations. Maybe this was youth and inexperience but never the less, slightly irritating. The biggest issue was with the paella. The squid ink tasted OK but did not have the coveted "socarrate" but rather some al dente rice bits. The vegetariana was in a word disgusting. The vegetables were not what one might ordinarily find in a Spanish paella - celery, fennel (?) a bit of carrot and limp, overcooked brocoli all in a soupy, gloppy mess. Nowhere to be found were brightly colored vegetables like capsicum , tomatoes, peas.on a bed of cheery safron colored rice. Instead this was a brownish-grey rice with overcooked vegetables in a soup More risotto (and not a good one) than paella we all agreed. To add insult, our waiter insisted that what sadly lay before us was authentic and that one would never get socarrat (crunchy carmelized rice at the bottom of the pan) with vegetarian paella because of the liquid in the vegetables. I might add that he was consulted on whether the paellas had the crunchy rice bottom prior to our ordering and he explained that the paellas in the round pans would yield this type of result and not the rectangular paellas that Pim Pam also serves. Oddly enough, other venues in Singapore are able to manage it. The horrible flavor of that bizarre vegetable combination lingered in my mouth well after leaving the restaurant. A very bad memory that lasted for hours..
5
Food was great especially the croquettes. Pricing are not too expensive either and most of all, staff were very pleasant and on the ball. Excellent service and great experience!
4
great food and great service! Highly reco the squid ink paella and must have the sangria. Went on a thu night and was impressed with the live band that performs there on thu. Will def go back again!
3
Came here on a sunday night and was very chill. Menu is small and simple and easy to choose from. Dishes came quickly and were rather tasty. Nice decor
5
Food and drinks were excellent. Must try -Sangria. Tapas - vast selection and portions just perfect. Some very unique dishes. Staff are highly engaging and attentive enhancing the whole dining experience starting from the point of reservation. Highly recommended.
4
Food was good and service exemplary. The service staff were attentive and were able to provide good recommendations.
4
the service is great , the food is excellent, the drinks are awesome. What else do you need to have a great time. Time to party. Great band too.
5
Excellent selection and quality of tapas! With the kinda crowed the place can get pretty noisy though.
4
Besides the chicken fideua being a little too salty, the other dishes were very tasty yet balanced. Loved their sangria and cauliflower steak! Big eaters might be put off by the small portions. So be warned.
4
Good food. Went in a big group so got to try lots of different things. The squid ink risotto deserves a special mention - not something I would have ordered myself but it was delicious and not at all fishy. The croquets were very good too. The only thing that wasn't good was the churros. Too thin and small and no longer hot by the time they reached the table and served with a chocolate dip that tasted like it was made from cocoa powder rather than quality chocolate.

So we went with my husband for a sandwich and a beer for lunch on a Saturday. We sat at the bar and placed our order. This was our third visit to Pim Pam. Our first dish arrived, and it was nice. Beers were nice and cold and we were just having exactly the kind of lunch we were looking for. Then The sandwiches arrived.... my husband's order was the right one and mine was far from it... I didn't realised until later, as I was quite engrossed on our conversation and quite hungry, but suddenly I noticed that the sandwich, described in the menu as chicken thigh, avocado and pim Pam sauce, with a chilli sign to it, was far from it... it was chicken thigh, check, boiled egg..???? Loads of ... and a sauce that looked like mayonnaise. When asked where was the avocado, why is there egg, the first person couldn't give us an answer, the chef came and still no explanation, and then someone who we presume was the manager, still couldn't give us an answer. He said they could bring one with avocado, but that they don't put avocado but guacamole... finally we gave up, lunch was ruined and just wanted to leave. Their explanation is that it is not avocado but dots of guacamole on the egg, which by the way doesn't feature in the menu, and the spice is on the bread that is home made... to this point, we still don't know why the egg was there and where the avocado went. We felt like they didn't have the ingredients and they just made it up they way they pleased. To be harmonious and kind, the gentleman we thought was the manager deducted both sandwiches, my husbands and the erroneous one, from our bill, so we appreciate that; however, it does leave us with a feeling of disappointment that we still don't know what went wrong..

Waiters were helpful and churros were great. Could have done with more ingredients in the paella. Also salad portions were very small.

Lovely service and all dishes and cocktails were great . Dishes we tried include paella , croquettes , squid
5
Food and service exceeded my expectations and the staff are well trained and friendly. Highly recommend the pumpkin salad with chicken! Paella portion is a little small for sharing, so do order more items for group meals.

As it was an open kitchen, the restaurant was filled with a strong oil and seafood smell. The food was so-so, some dishes e were too salty.

Pales in comparison to its first sister outlet, FOC Restaurant at Hong Kong Street. Yummy squid ink paella and octopus, sad anchovies, even sadder desserts. We finished our food, but there is no reason for a return visit.

Food was better than I expected. Portions were nicely sized with about 2 dishes per pax being plenty. Sadly though, the drinks were very disappointing. While I can appreciate the "cute" presentation of their cocktails (mini bottles) they were premade and tasted like it. For the price point you are better off sticking to the wine and beer list.

Have a delightful dinner with a friend two days ago. We are treated with great service from the word go. Our waiter is excellent in his recommendation and attentiveness. My friend is impressed with the quality of the food served as she is very familiar with the Catalan cuisine. I am particularly impressed by the cocktail he recommends, which is taking part in a competition. Hope it wins and go on to represent Singapore in the international competition. I love the squid ink paella and churros too. Thumbs up!

I've enjoyed several meals at FOC in Hong Kong Street so I had fairly high expectations of the new Pim Pam concept. Whilst the location and space are not my cup of tea, the outstanding service we experienced, the excellent food and the value were all excellent. We had a few different waiters and all stood out. One listed the six or so specials off the top of his head, displaying actual knowledge of the dishes he was speaking about, another picked up that we had been double charged on the bill and rectified the situation and all looked after us well. Very rare in Singapore. The food was all good but the beef cheeks special and the well reviewed octopus were utter stand outs.

My husband is Catalan and he is usually very picky about eating out in Spanish/ Catalan restaurants outside of Spain. But Pim Pam is definitely a place he would chose and recommend. He loves the tapas and paella there. We usually go for the croquetes with ham or mushroom, the patatas bravas, the garlic prawns and the bread with tomato. You also have to try the squid ink paella. Everything is delicious, the service very friendly and the atmosphere is very warm and inviting. Thumbs up

A good food place with friends. Good atmosphere to enjoy a good meal. But the portion are small. Plus the staff knows what's good on their menu.

Had the squid ink paella and thoroughly enjoyed it! Flavourful and with enough wok hei to give it some kick. That and the impeccable service made for a beautiful dining experience. I'll definitely be back to try the other paellas!

Food was delicious. Servers were keen to sell cocktails and consequently were passionate and knowledgeable about them. However decor was a bit odd and the atmosphere was lacking-felt like a chain restaurant.
3
the service was great. but most of the food we ordered that night were bland and for the price we paid, was just ok. if you must order one thing, order the “Torrija” with Vanilla Ice Cream. came highly recommended by the server that night and it was awesome indeed. lovely ambience, though

This is our second visit. I was against coming back but my wife insisted we try it again. What a mistake. Took way to long between dishes. My son waited one hour for his main, had to send it back twice and it was so under cooked we had to ask for it to be removed from the bill. They suggested they would do it "complimentary". Uhm. No. It did not get served so it's not complimentary, it's just not served!!! The pork ribs were very fatty and should have been cooked more. The "patatas bravas" are too "re-imagined". You'd be hard pressed to find anything similar in Spain. The same goes for the weird paella dishes. The "huevos estrellados" were good, really good (minus the weird long potatoes). The service was too eager to serve out our sparkling water to get a second one in. We will give this one a pass next time.

First time at this place (though I visited FOC at about Hong Kong st when they first launched ). Love most of the dishes I had at pimpam - Tried almost all the tapas and here are the favourites:- patatas bravas- octopus Galician style - prawns al ajillo- pim Pam migas ( a pretty interesting dish which integrated bread crumbs with runny egg, potato foam and chorizo) So-so tapas dishes: I also had the pork & cuttlefish meat balls for tapas - however, felt that it tasted quite oriental hence I wouldn't recommend that. As for the crab meat croquetas - it would have been great if the crab meat is not so mushy - but I Guess its personal preference. And for the paella - must order: pork chop scallop paella - though I feel the pork chop may be better off de-boned and of larger pieces (coz couldn't taste much and the bones overwhelmed the meat).Overall - it has been a great experience at pim pambyFOC. Go for it

the octopus Catalan style is a good dish and original taste.but this about what i found attractive in the dinner.plate of cheese for 20$ is rather limited (although served with an interesting chutney. croquetas were gooey, the dough likely missing cooking or starch. but worst is the patatas bravas re-invented as a re-fried stack of chips - hence greasy - with alternating blobs of garlic mayonnaise and some sort of ketchup.service is way too overwhelming, refilling half empty glasses, jumping to remove plates as soon as empty yet the last spoon not swallowed.the comparatively high price, maybe consistent with orchard, could be forgiven with interesting dishes, but in the context... not to recommend

Night out with my 2 girlfriends, didnt know much about the place but decided to be adventurous. Wr attempted their cold cuts, paella (scallop one), octopus galatian style and their pork (still pink!). Omg so good. Everything was delish. Never had to ask for my water cup to be refilled as well. They were that attentive

It was not a good experience at all. The waitress, assigned to us, was terrible and all she was interested in was whether we wanted to order somemore. Dinner was at $104/head for 3 of us. Portions were extremely small. Towards the end, I think the senior waiter noticed our irritation and tried to pay more attention and gave my wife a free chocolate mouse with a candle because it was her birthday. By then, damage to our evening already done. Bad "after taste

It was an awesome night of fantastic food and drinks. The 1kg steak was medium to our liking and sharing did not make it lethargic for all. The lovely Sangria came in nice little bottles where you can manage your number of drinks.I had two portions of the squid ink paella, authentically done with a bit of charred below. The staff is attentive to us without overdoing it. Dinner was pleasantly ended with tasty desserts. Will come back again for the steak and paella, and everything.Thanks Pim Pam
