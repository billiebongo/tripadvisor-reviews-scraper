Loved this Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore's Little India. Felt very authentic and had an extensive menu. Loved the dosa and the ginger tea. A great cheap-eat in Singapore!
4
The South Indian food is good here... they have some thing called dosa meal which comes with three vegetable dishes apart from usual chutneys and sambar. The bhaji for poori reminds me old time tamilnadu
Enjoyed
1
Non smiling crew; pathetically tasting vada ; tourist crowd; decent taste food ; tissue paper for foreigners and only spoon and folk for Indians; avg tasting coffee ! Price is good for Dosa, idly and Pongal !
5
While friendly to tourists, make no mistake, this is a local joint. The food is delicious, cheap, and vegetarian. I highly recommend breakfast at the Komala Vilas Serangoon Road location (one block away). It opens at 7am and the dosa are to die for!

Located in Little India (close to the Metro station). There are three premises, all serving excellent purely vegetarian food, we visited two of them and found the same quality in both. Specialising in South Indian cuisine but also offering North Indian too. They are extremely busy with mainly local clientele and offering a wide menu of choices, idlis, dosas, uttapams, etc. Itâ€™s not fine dining with food served on banana leaves or patria plates (you can eat with your fingers if you wish). We particularly enjoyed the Rawa Mysore Masala. Large and filling and rather hot. The bill coming out at $12 for two people, including tea. Great
5
I viistd the buffalo road location but all sites have similar menus. The dosai is nice and crispy. I enjoyed the rava dosa which was perfect. Rustic seating but for S$7:50 had 2 filter coffees, rava dosa vada sambar. Wish I could have tried the bhaturas which looked delish but had no foom in my tumm

If you are a vegetarian and looking for south indian options, this is the place for you. Its always crowded - difficult to get a seat as they are bang in the middle of Little India and visited by locals too ! We had most of our lunches and dinner here during our stay in Singapore. The food is awesome and prepared well - but the only downside is that as tourist - you will need to pay in 'cash only' they accept the local debit card tough. Surprising for a restaurant with so many customers. I suspect that the margins are low and want to keep the CC charges away. This apart - the food was awesome. On the day we arrived in Singapore - I went to this place and took 2 rice meals as parcels to our hotel as the kids did not want to come post travel. The quantity was huge and was enough for close to 4 people and too many items (curries, samabar, rasam, etc) - had to throw out lot of stuff. Highly recommend this place - don't miss it
5
It's been around 13 years since I last visited this restaurant. I ordered only a simple Masala Thosai (a wrap with potato fillings) the last time, but this time round, my dinner mate was equally adventurous and appreciative of Indian food that we ordered several dishes which we had no idea what to expect...Everything turned out to be delicious! (See pics) My favourite was the Gobi Manchurian. Looking at its name, I believe it's a fusion innovation. It's a special item on the menu and available only after 6pm. Made entirely of vegetable, go try it and figure out what it is. Hoho
5
Absolutely delicious vegetarian Indian food . We ordered a selection of dishes mainly by pointing, including the Rawa dosai with dips which we ended up ordering twice. I washed my dinner down with a cup of sweet milky ginger and cardamom tea, which I can't imagine drinking at home but tasted perfect with the meal. Loved the authentic taste and feel of the place and wished we had had time to make a repeat visit . Definitely a highlight of many delicious eating experiences in Singapore. Nice story of the founder of the now chain arriving in Singapore from India in 1936 with just a suitcase.
5
Wiah you had infinite apetite to try their dishes. Authentic south Indian dishes. Must try their wada-sambhar. Dosas are excellent too. Must eat place.
5
Very good food I recommend. One of the best Indian restaurant I had except for the mango Lassi too much yogurt.
4
We visited the outlet at 76-78 Serangoon Road and sat upstairs. The staff were friendly and helpful although some have only rudimentary English. The kids loved the thick mango lassis and fresh coconuts. We tried the peas masala and aloo gobi masala - the grown-ups found everything delicious although the food was generally a little too spicy for the kids (this is not the establishment's fault, of course). Prices are very low. A great place for cheap and tasty eats
4
This vegetarian restaurant has been renovated recently. The service is quick and the food is tasty. Just love the dosai that comes in various form. The cone dosai is particularly my favorite, crispy outside and moist inside. It's perfect to end the meal with a bru coffee. Highly recommend.
5
This restorant was full downstairs and they told us to try upstairs. Upstairs we had to wait for few minutes for free table. Behind still was long cue.We ordered 4 smaller vegeterian foods but they have run out of 2 already. Likly we shared our table with kind Indian gentlemen who suggested special rice meal which was delicious. Good was reasonable prices and I can say one of the best I ever had. Would love to come back to taste more delicious food
4
Hi,I have been to this restaurant couple of times and found the food to be very good.This is a south Indian cuisine restaurant.I usually order dosa meal and marsala dosa...Price is on the lower side. Staff is very polite.Do try it once.Regards,Prakash Matuwan

Hi,Been here last week with my wife for lunch. Ordered "thosa meal" and "poori set". Thosa meal was around 7+$ if i remember correctly which was nice but expensive for its kind. Oil usage was bit high compared to other komala vilas restaurants. Overall a decent restaurant
1
We visited last sunday about 16.00hrs and waited few minutes next to the cashier at second floor. As there was no one to guide us, I asked from the man who is appeared to be like chief waiter "can I order?" Then he angryly shout back to me commanding to order from the cashier. Then, without arguing with him I asked from the Cashier " why he is shouting?" and left from the resturant as we wanted to enjoy our meal not to be humilated. Whole evening was spoiled. Will not visit any Komala Vilas again
5
You will get amazing south-indian dishes (I tried only south-indian dishes), mostly better than what you get in India. Authentic Tamilnadu dishes, very good taste and quantity. If you like South indian food, I would say this is the best you can have in Singapore. Just go for it.All dishes are tast

We visited this very busy Indian vegetarian restaurant for an evening meal. Arriving at about 8pm we were shown straight to a table but by the time we left at about 8:45 pm customers were queuing to wait for a vacant table. We chose a Vegetable Biryani and a Gobi Manchuria ( lightly battered cauliflower in an Indo Chinese sauce.) It was a good meal and we enjoyed all the different flavours. This restaurant does not serve alcohol but we had a refreshing cold lemon drink. The bill came to S$20for two. We feel that this is a restaurant to go in, eat and leave rather than spend time chatting over a relaxing drink following the meal
5
A nice and famous restaurant with great indian food, many options and they are plenty. Staff was fast and helpful.
5
It's very old restaurant in little India Singapore. Serves excellent n delicious south Indian food.
It didn't miss my home Mumbai to have authentic food here.
4
Two of us visited and we chose from the "light meals" menu. We had Bhattura and Paper Dosai, plus a cup of Teh Tarek each. Meals were delicious! Total bill was under $14!! What a steal!
5
We come here frequently as the food and service is very good. My children love the masala Thosai here. Great value and great food.
3
The food was absolutely delicious! Only thing that let it down was the service. The staff were quite rude and forgot my meal, I had to ask them for it which was a shame. The food really is good though.
4
We have dined in this restaurant many times whenever we visited Little India. The food is awesome and authentic South Indian. You will get good hygenic, tasty south Indian food here.
5
Coming here has become a pilgrimage every time my family visits Singapore. It is reliably cheap and delicious :-) Don't expect anything fancy or well plated, just go in thinking of the authentic flavours of South India and that's exactly what you'll get. Good hearty, well made and delicious. Couldn't ask for more.
4
Sometimes you get a dish and you are in awe of it! The sambar that came along with my Kidâ€™s Dosa was out of the world. Probably the brinjal was nicely cooked and all its flavour were part of the sambar. It was full of flavours. Though we tried north Indian this time, I had two bowls of sambar just to drink. Drooling again as I am typing!We tried - Tandoori roti (okay type), Panner Butter masala (amazing), Dal (nice) and Allo gobi (nice with low texture). Jeera rice was okay, I did not like the texture. I also did not find Cheese Dosa interesting as it was not crispy and less cocked.It is unusual to eat North Indian cuisine in a South Indian specialty restaurant, but we tried it on recommendation. It was good.The food was surprisingly cheap. Servers were courteous. No frill, basic ambience, good for casual eating out
5
Ive been eating here with my family since i was a kid.Though the prices have increased and the standards have dropped slightly, we still do visit when we are in the mood for south indian vegetarian food. I would recommend the rice set meal though the other tiffin options like bhattura and thosai are yummy too.I love their vadais! Can be eaten with or without chutney.Give this place a shot if you are looking for cheap south indian vegetarian food!
5
We've been visiting for over twenty years and I'm happy to say it's still the best South Indian food in little India Service has improved, ambiance and decor are the same. It gets the Narendra Modi tick of approval-praise indeed. Good alternatives are MTR1924 and Woodlands
5
An excellent South Indian vegetarian restaurant inexpensive.But can get very busy. Masala Dosai and Samosa is outstanding.
4
Lovely location and excellent food..
Vegeterians delight and quality was amazing..
really enjoyed our dinner...
5
I tried their chole Bhature masala dosa idli vada Perfect taste. Very nice masala tea One tea / coffee can b shared by two people
5
Great place to go for south Indian fare, not too expensive and clean. The only drawback is standing in a queue for the payment and also for the self service ...
4
I first tried Komala Vilas several years ago when I was staying in Little India for a couple weeks. I was immediately hooked and go back whenever I'm in Singapore! The fully-vegetarian menu is pretty simplistic but has plenty of options. This location in particular gets very crowded, but for good reason. The food is delicious, the service is quick, and the prices are right
3
The legend of Komala's reaches everyone and you would eventually end up there. However it failed to live upto the name. Service is pedestrian but thats not the major concern. The dosas were ordinary and had to contend with Coffee to feel better about the place.Hope its a better experience for others
4
The Komal Vilas Restaurant has a few outlets centered around Little India. The food is authentic Indian vegetarian, All the outlets are always crowded, The managers are extremely helpful and the staff courteous and efficient. Best place to get the favouirite soth indian IDLI/DOSA. Value for money. Great food for my family consisting of children and senior citizens . Would certainly recommend it to all Indians visiting Singapore who prefer indian food
5
This Resturant is part of the same Komala Vilas onwers which have main resturant at Serangoon Road and where recently the Indian Prime Minister Visited with the Singapore PM and made it famous. Pure Vegetarian and very reasonably price resturant. The Race Course Branch is usually quiter and a table is easy to grab during peak hours. The place is located right outside EXIT D on the NE Line (Purple Line) of MRT and is therefore very convienient access. The South Indian fares are remarkable with must try IDLI + DOSA and DOSAS.. The Chutney and Sambhar are exceptionally good and understand that all the food is delivered from their central kitchen at Serangoon Road hence quality is always consistent.They also have a North Indian menu which has excellent Bhindi Jaipuri (a fried Bhindi dish) and very nice Yellow daal.The Rice Meal (Sappad) is the most exceptional Indian Thali they have which has 3 vege, raita, sambhar, sweet dish and some condiments making it a complete meal for $8.50
4
Best place to go for South Indian vegetarian food! What more can you ask? But I'd say, it's time to move up the convenience scale. Many Indian restaurants back home offer more space and convenience. Standing in queues for billing and then again at the food counter for self service takes time, especially when you have a bus load of Indian tourists landing at the same time as you. And then you don't have enough clean tables to sit and have a peaceful meal. Food is alright, but space and service can be improved
4
The Race Course location has A/C and is a welcome relief in Singapore unlike the original branch on Serangoon road. Tried breakfast and elai sappadu (banana leaf meals). All breakfast items are tasty - not too oily or salty. Elai sappadu is heavy/filling. There is a reason Komala Vilas has such high ratings and that is consistency - we tried eating several days here and food was consistently good
5
We visited the place number of times during the trip to Singapore and we felt the place to be an assurance of availability of authentic, good and tasty food at any hour of the day.
5
We had our breakfast and dinner in this restaurant in Little India . Authentic South Indian food especially Pongal , vada, dosa is very tasty here . Small restaurant and always crowded but food at reasonable price .
5
Very authentic Indian restaurant with very little tourists.
I was brought there by an Indian Friend and we had nice breakfast.
Good food and very cheap.
4
Had been here twice to have my lunch. You get good South Indian food including Dosa and filter coffee.
4
Great service from the manager himself. Very pleasant guy. But the food was just amazing. I don't usually eat at vegetarian restaurants but if I lived in Singapore I'd be here all the time especially for the banana leaf meals and dosas.
3
Unlike other South Indian Restaurants in Singapore, the setting here is just ok and If you're looking for a great dining experience it may not tick all the boxes . If your are looking for typical South Indian food , this is a good place to visit . If you are hungry and would like a proper meal , the plain dosa meal is a must have . It has a good combination of curry and chutney and a payasam. Vadas are ok not as crispy as one would expect as they are made and stored in traditional style wooden boxes with glass windows. They could do a better job with th Mysore masala dosa. Idli is good with chutney. The onion chutney needs a bit more spice. The chola batura is awesome, must try!Other goodies are filter coffee and gulab jamun.EnjoyV
4
If you want an authentic experience you can't pass Komala Vilas. Had read about this in a AA Guide City Pack book as to the best Indian Vegetarian restaurant to visit and can see why. Wandering down Serangoon Rd to find this place the brilliance of colour, smells of spices, fruit, vegetables, and so many lights like a fairytale. Have visited at Diwali, even better!Nothing fancy inside, do as the locals do, great choice of food, much of this never seen before, friendly, reasonable, quick, and so tasty. Served up on banana leaves.Love the fact we were the only ones who weren't Indians here!To end the night wandered round Little India, talk about a sensual experience
4
Komala Vilas on the Serangoon Road is an absolute must for us whenever we are in Little India. The thali - the meals they serve are heavenly and a must for anybody who wants to have authentic South Indian food.For a first-timer, the thali could be a bit overwhelming (wish they could cut down on the portion size a bit) but every single preparation is worth a try. Their dosas are also wonderful and the filter coffee is great to wash down your meal or snack. Do stick to having their south Indian fare and avoid their north Indian or chinese preparations. Komala Vilas should be a 'must visit' while in Little Indi
4
Komala vilas once again shows that it can make the consistent quality food that it serves for years. The Sunday vegetables are a great selection in the South Indian meal and coffee as usual excellent The service at the race course road outlet is exceptional/ being a regular they remember all the small needs of their returning customers and anticipate them without asking - to me that is a pinnacle of customer service and must be commended.
5
While shopping in Little India and enjoying the Indian atmosphere there, we stopped by at Komala Vilas for a bite. We were served perfectly authentic South Indian snacks like Rasa Vada, Rawa Dosa, Idiyappam etc. It was as authentic as say, Chennai in India would offer. Priced very attractively, we noticed that this fully air- conditioned vegetarian eatery was drawing patrons of several nationalities including Europeans, Chinese, local Singaporeans & Indians of course. Service was prompt, the supervisor pleasant mannered and the whole ambience welcoming! Strongly recommended. We will definitely return
4
Very nice place to have vegetarian food in little India, Singapore.. Had Dosa combo etc over here, good quality and good taste, specially for Indians..
3
The food was good. The service was great.
Masala dosai was stuffed full of mashed potatoes and onions, while garlic naan went nicely with aloo gobi masala.
Mango lassi was rich & scrumptiously filling.
No-frills restaurant perfect for a simple vegetarian meal.
4
Try the Idlis, Dosas and south Indian meal and enjoy it. Skip everything in the North Indian and Indian Chinese Menu.
5
Amazing little restaurant in Little India. Lots of locals, crowded, the ambiance is all part of the experience. The prices are great. But the food would be worth it at any price.
5
Fantastic vegetarian food. This restaurant is apparently the original one. Very, very busy and popular with locals but cheap and amazing food. Must go just for the experience and taste. The staff are excellent the food is even better.
3
Very good south Indian vegetarian food - very reasonably priced. The filter coffee and the dosas and idlis are very well made. Great value for money.
4
As a tourist I like to eat like a local and when in Little India I like to try places like this. I was the only westerner in the restaurant at lunchtime which tells me the food is good. All vegetarian, the food is varied and tasty, but maybe on the cool side for me. I had the dosai meal with masala dosai, 3 veg dishes and samber. Very filling food. The mango lassi was thick and full of fruit. A little rough around the edges, but I was made to feel very welcome. Worth a second visi
5
This is a vegetarian aircon restaurant, bright and airy, sinks to wash you hands in, and lots of tables. The people are helpful and friendly. They helped my blind friend home when I was out. Masala dosai and rassam soup are my favorites. Clean wholesome servings. Highly recommended
2
I would like to admit that we were misguided by the overall high ratings given to this place. Komala Vilas on Race Course Road is no great shakes. It's just another restaurant that offers cheap Indian food. We ordered a chapati thali which had sticky elastic chapatis, and cold dal and veggies. The other dish we ordered was rawa dosai and gratefully this serving was hot - but the taste was ordinary.While the meal was super easy on the pocket and costed sub $20, overall it was not at all a good experience- totally avoidable - I presume we can get better food at any of the hawker centers around
5
If you are in Little India and want to have a sumptuous South Indian Meal at a budget price, step into Komala Vilas.They are omnipresent, the good ones are in Buffalo Road and Serangoon Road. Don't miss the Ghee Paper Roast, Sambar idly, Idiyappam and Filter Coffee :) Yummy
4
We visited this place for almost all days on our visit to Singapore. They serve authentic South Indian food at affordable price.
3
Nice food for breakfast
Idli Wada Sambhar,Filter Coffee and dosa are tasty
Value for money restaurant.
5
Have been here every time I have been to Singapore since 1994 with both friends, family, and alone - the food is always great and the staff pleasant.
5
Went past lunchtime to buy some ladoo & milk burfi..they sure still tasted as good after so long since I last bought them! Despite the increase in price now, it doesn't really bother me as long they still AWESOME as always!!
4
Located in Little India, Singapore.
Tried Thali good value for money
service was good even though the restaurant was crowded.
4
Had a very nice food in this Restaurant. Good value for money. South Indian Coffee is unforgettable. Even the Lunch and Masala Dosa...
4
Nice enjoyable meal over there coffee was excellent and quantity they provide of each thing is more worth than we pay
5
Try to go there during off peak hours and try their authentic south indian stuff (idli and dosa) We ate here 5 times during our 1 week trip.
5
This restaurant has been there for a long time and is frequented by Indians who are visiting Singapore and also by people who stay here.I will not write specifically about any food (South Indian) because everything is just nice. The waiters are very polite and attend to every need with a smile.Most of the time i have visited, I have not been able to go away from the rice meals that they have. Absolutely delicious.Beware of the long queues if you end up at the peak hour.
5
This restaurant is very nice to eat in a real traditional indian way. They offer all kind of different meals with rice, flat breads and sauces. The meals either come on banana leaves or big plates. You can chose to eat with your hands or with fork and knife. Friendly service and delicious indian food!
4
Great place for South-Indian meals. Customers are mostly locals. Feels like being back to Tamil Nadu. Do not miss their delicious Dosa.
5
Good south indian fare at very reasonable cost. Worth a visit. Also located in the old quarter of little India. Minutes from the MRT
3
The restaurant is overcrowded during peak hours.
Its overhyped. However if you have been travelling and in want of Indian Food , please try. The food was served preety fast.Taste was also good.Just the waiters messed up with my table. Might be an exceptional case.
4
as i m vegetarian when i came to singapore i thought it will be difficult to find vegetarian food but when you go to this restaurant you will find so many dishes that you eat.
5
I had the best experience of having hot, fresh breakfast at komala vilas. Hot, soft Idlis with sambhar , chutney, concluded with hot cuppa of coffee. A must have for all those who wish I eat in little india on son early morning. It may be a bit crowded during peak hours with long queues hence one must plan to adjust their timings accordingly.
5
If you are home sick and want to relish vegeterian Indian food this is the place to be go to. Very reasonably priced you can have a full meal at less than S$10 (about Rs. 500/- in INR). Clean and hygenic and tasty hot food . what more can you ask for . It is far better than most other Indian restaurants that are more pretentious and pricey. all in all likely to become your regualr eating joint if you are an Indian with an extended stay at singapor
4
Warning - There are a number of Komala Vilas Restaurants in Little India. We went to the one in Racecourse Road, so I can't comment on the others. This one was reasonably clean, busy & the food was really. really good. Service fast, down to earth but helpful. Portions well more than enough. Great flavours, good food. Fantastic Dosai. Would go back anytime I'm near Little India - AND cheap as chips! Fantastic value
4
I had lunch here and enjoyed it a lot for quite little money. The place was full of locals which I took for a good sign. staff was really friendly and helpful and the service incredibly quick. The food was tasty as well and as far as I can judge quite authentic. It is all vegetarian so no meat, but all the tastyness does not make you miss it at all
5
Great place for snacks , lunch and dinner conveniently located on buffalo road offers 100% pure vegetarian delicacies, Specialize in poori bhaji , Utthapam and steaming idli with generous serving of chutney and sambar the typical south Indian favorite.. Good place for lunch with rice plate offerings: must try are poori lunch plate .
4
I and a friend went here for breakfast. We ordered one order of Puri and one order of Uttapam. Our order was quickly brought and the food was cooked well and very tasty. The South Indian filter coffee was superb. We asked for extra decoction and it was well brought.
1
The restaurant is marked as one of the must-visit restaurants in little India Singapore. However, much to my dismay it is dirty! I wouldn't eat there.
4
This place is not fancy, but always full of locals, a good sign, and the food is very tasty, and cheap!
4
The best south indian food in Singapore. I had visited the place several times during my stay in singapore. Tasty and yummy idlies, crispy dosas. etc etc. Best south Indian food in Singapore
3
One can enjoy south indian food at Komalas very closer proximity with good variety always little busy plan to visit during weekdays for higher attention
good pricing of food
4
This is supposed to be an inexpensive South Indian vegetarian place in Little India that reputedly serves one of the best dosas in town. I ate dosas every day for almost a month in India, so I am a huge fan. The place is small (upstairs reserved for those eating rice) with simple wooden tables and chairs. Half the clientele were tourists that day. Service is lackadaisical - it gets done but they're not overly prompt. I ordered the cone dosa (which is really a paper dosa set up like a traffic cone - traffic stopping but flavour wise same as paper dosa) butter paneer masala and mango lassi. The dosa was good and the 3 accompanying sauces were typical. Most of the locals ordered the paper or regular masala dosa (thicker and filled with cooked potato and veg). The mango lassi was not great and pricey at $4. Someone had raved about the mango milkshake so I ordered this too ($5!) but it took awhile to make so I'm assuming it was fresh mangos. It was delicious but too expensive! The butter paneer masala was very good and even though expensive ($8) it's one of those dishes which almost converts me to vegetarianism (paneer is cheese). If you are in the area looking for an inexpensive meal, definitely head on in. However their dosa isn't necessarily something I'd ride all the way to Little India for. My meal cost $25 but if you stick to dosa or thali plate and water that's kept in a pitcher on the table, you can eat for less than $10
5
Great vegetarian food at a good price. Not a fancy place, its all about the taste. Ive sampled different things and all have been soo good. Only word of caution; the rice meals are really big and so tasty that its hard to stop eating, so you should only have them if you are prepared to roll out sideways... The dosai is my favourite
5
I stumbled in because I was very hungry and it smelt good. Inside it was pretty packed and I was asked if I minded sharing a table with another line diner. This turned out well as he was able to guide me on what was good.I had a poori with chickpea curry and a mango lassi. The poori was the biggest I've ever seen and it was all so delicious, and it cost $9 in total. Can't say fairer than that really
4
Komalas is a great place to grab authentic south Indian food at a great price. The set meals are excellent value, you will not go hungry. My favourite is masala dosai (about $3) followed by a cup of tea (about $1.50). The restaurant is relatively clean - at least compared to many hawker stalls. This is not a fancy restaurant and it is not trying to be. Just good food at a good price.
1
Dont even bother to try the north Indian dishes at this place. I was there to eat the no onion, no garlic food (Jain food) and they offered a choice on the menu. I picked an item - Bhindi Jaipuri and the bored waiter told me that that was not available. Instdead i should try the Bhindi Masala. I did try it ... gosh were th ebhindis raw and some were so hard and fibrous..... The sauce/gravy was really coloured orange.... horrible.... This rates amongst the worst meals I have had in Singapore in tha last one month
5
These days - It is difficult to get this quality of vegetarian food in cities like Bangalore, Chennai or Hyderabad.The food is delicious and the Set Lunch / Dinner is a must try. You get the pappu, vegetable curries, Sambhar, Kozhambu, Rasam, Majjege, Curd, Appadam. Rice with Puri or Chapathi. All for 7.5 Sin Dollars. :-) Go to Little India and ask for Komalas - and anyone will tell you the way - even though there are numerous other Tamil and a few Telugu restaurants in the same place
