lively bright convivial setting for a friday lunch gathering, waiters were very obliging, taking our photos whenever we asked. food platters were good for sharing, food was tasty and fresh
5
This restaurant offers very good food at reasonable prices. You can order also all kinds of beers. Service is very fast.
4
Good lunch with old friends. The sausage platter is fantastic and the pork knuckle is amazing. Both are must try. The beer is great too. Good food, great Company and wonderful service staff. What more can you ask for?
4
I went here for a dinner and the food was really good. The place is nice and the service was ok, in the overall, my experience was positive. I suggest this place if you are looking for German traditional food.
5
Have a wonderful dinning with family on Christmas day, the ambience is good and will visit the restaurant again.

After 6 months living in Asia, we were so desperate for a European roast dinner! We had done a little research and couldn't really find anywhere that seemed to offer what we wanted, then we stumbled on this place and it seemed perfect! We ordered one of the Christmas Special Platters - Lamb Shank, Crispy Pork, Mash, Veg, Red Cabbage.... And two big pints of German Beer.We had a lovely dinner at a reasonable price.We would recommend if you are craving something German or if you fancy trying European cuisine

Many Singapore restaurants seem to fall into the same trap to maximise profit and that is: employ servers from countries that will work for lower wages than Other countries and forget about staff training. It’s a mistake that Brotzeit Vivo made last night with us and I won’t visit again. Yes the service was lousy to say the least but the last straw was the quality of food preparation. We each had pork knuckles and they had dried out so much there was very little succulent meat on them, the Rosti potatoes were drenched in cooking oil, the potato salad was lousy, the sauerkraut was insipid the waitress was brain dead and clueless.The price was almost as much as a meal for two at Mortons steakhouse. All in all a rubbishy meal, overpriced and I won’t be back
3
The ambience and food was great. We had done a reservation for 7:00PM on 25 Dec 2017 a week before. However, to our surprise we were told all Chicken options were already out of stock for the day(at 7:10PM). Being a holiday night, I felt the restaurant should have been more responsible in terms of calculating the amount required to cater the needs, as the booking was made much earlier. We were about 11 pax and out of these only 4 were open to pork consumption. And rest of us were left with just the option of Chicken Sausage. That was quite disappointing, as we were looking forward to this dinner for quite a long time. Apart from this, the platter was good and service was also good. In future atleast, I hope the restaurant has enough supply to cater to the festive demand
5
Atmosphere was nice, good for couples and friends celebrating new year or Christmas eve cause the close later than most restaurants. Their coctails and beers were well crafted and will surely give that subtle kick... food serving is just right ... and the staff are nice and accommodating. We entered a few minutes earlier than the reserved time but we didn’t have any issues getting our seat.. We enjoyed i
4
Quite a consistently good experience, the beer of course is awesome, the pork knuckle is good to share, we often have the cold cuts and cheese but also the fladen. Our kids for some reason like the fish and chips, is it the beer batter? Hopefully not of course haha. But have to say also when you want to go watch a soccer game it is a good place with plenty of beers and excellent German inspired foods. A well done restauran
4
I have been here at least 4 occassions.
The food never failed to impress us.
We have always ordered their platters.
Worth the calories and money .
Service can be better.
4
Stopped by here to have a break from shopping at Vivo City, its thirsty work! Just had a couple of lagers and some pretzels which were served warm and came with salted butter. Also had some nice views of the river and Sentosa island.
4
lots of fun!
Conveniently located at the Harbourfront Walk in ViviCity this Resaturant serves German food at its best.
5
well we had a great time catching up with friends over a few beers while enjoying this massive meat dish whole chicken, large roast pork, ribs and German Sausage
3
Here's a nice German quiet corner with a nice menu.Stick to authentic German dishes and you should be fine.Everything is well served and presented.I made a mistake of ordering s steak. It was clearly frozen and defrosted incorrectly.It had no taste and was rubbery.I was surprised none of the staff asked what was going on with the food left behind.They didn't care to notice half a brick of a beef left behind.Beer is excellent.So stick to beer and pork knuckle
5
My family and I enjoyed Brotzeit Germsn Restaurant with a picturesque harbor front and the Sentosa Resort. We ordered several huge platters of the various German sausages, German salads and the Weiner Schnitzels, chicken and also the various cheeses. We also ordered a barrel of the beer. Food was good but the service needs some improvement. It was our 2nd time to Brotzeit
2
I’ve enjoyed the Brotzeit restaurants in Singapore since they opened; good German beer, relaxed atmosphere and some authentic food choices. Maybe they’ve expanded beyond their ability to maintain consistent quality or just don’t care. My Saturday night visit to the Katong branch was the third time in a row for disappointment. Customer service was nonexistent, I had to go up to the bar 3 times to get attention (1x for first order, 2x for fresh drinks, 3x to get the bill). Simply, they didn’t care if we were there or not. my wife and I agreed that the food is no longer well prepared and has little flavor. My favorite go to dish, the wiener schnitzel, was dry, tough, and had little taste. Even the potato salad lacked - basically cold potato with mayo. For beer and sausage, it’s probably still ok. But keeping your repeat customers is about more; warm,welcoming atmosphere, and friendly attentive staff., oh...and consistent food quality. Get it together Brotzeit, I’d like to come back.
5
Tasty Food and Welcoming Staff. Sits on the edge of Vivo City with beautiful scenery of harbour front pier and Resort world Sentosa Brotzeit the German culinary experience one should not miss on your visit to Singapore. Well balanced taste and the presentation well over the expectations price wise much reasonable too. On our visit while the Octoberfest they had offers with happy hour and more. The friendliness and the welcoming attitude of the staff should be highly appreciated. We tried Fladen with smoked Salmon, spaghetti with meat balls and Cheese snacks which were presented nicely and tasted great too. It's for sure time to remember when you relax having a beer selected from their great and adequate beer list.
4
Made this our final meal before heading back to the airport and what a good shout it was. It's close to Raffle City and we happened to be here around the start of Oktoberfest so the perfect choice. Very nice food and I was very happy to find somewhere to serve a Stein of lager without thinking that I am crazy
4
Premium grilled tenderloin: must try. The mushroom sauce is simply amazing. Definitely worth trying for steak lovers.Only downside was they missed one of the orders despite repeating our orders and then the person who took the order seemed to have disappeared. A great food experience was spoiled by poor service. The staff didn't even offer an apology. Be ready to wait for your meal if you visit on a weekend.
4
If you are craving for good German food and Weissbier, it hardly disappoints.Good ambiance and good variety of food.
1
The Filipino staff is not friendly, not helpful and very rude.This is the worse bar and restaurant service I've ever experience.
5
The crispy pork knuckle is always cooked to perfection. That is one of the must try dish beer. The service is fast and efficient even though it is crowded most of the time.
5
Just left this place absolutely stuffed! Great sausage and sides. Food came quickly and the waiting staff were very efficient and attentive.
Prices were pretty good too.
5
Amazing German food in the tropical heart of Singapore.
Enjoy a chill Bavarian beer with delicious Signature dishes such as Nürnberger,
pork dishes or some quality pastas and cheese on German bread...
5
Me and my brother try their signature dishes Pork Knuckle.
The skin very crispy and they big portion.
The taste is very good...worth to try.
Sorry i'm not take a picture of it because we were very hungry..lol.
4
Very rarely eat at chains when traveling, (especially in Asia), however on advice came for dinner with only the one night in town and not disappointed at all. Shared the "Essentail Platter" and way, way too much food. The staff was a mix of Indonesian and Malaysian and all had average English. If you want something NOT Asian in Signapore then this is worth the $
5
It was a birthday dinner for 3 and we ate at the Katong branch along East coast rd.The infamous crackling German trotters is to die for...crispy skin and yummy succulent well cooked meat sold at S$39. With pickled cucumber and sourkour it balanced the oiliness of the trotter.Luved the mixed platter of German sausages offered at S$36 firm and juicy to be dipped in horseradish and mustard. At S$32 you get plumb fresh mussels and deep fried fish cooked in white sauce served with potatoes carrot and garlic bread.To enjoy our meal we ordered dark beer and it was a dinner well spent.Broitzeit lived up to its German fare
4
Was at the Westgate branch. Open air restaurant but the huge fan did not make one feel warm at least at dinner.. not too sure during lunch.We ordered the meat combb for 6 pax which consists of sausages, beef ribs, a large oven roast chicken and pork knuckle. Some side dishes of sauerkraut, potatoes and thin fries. Great if you are a meat eater.The restaurant was crowded so service is lacking. Our side dishes did not appear after we ate up our main dishes though it was partly our fault we ordered subsequently.. but how hard it is to dish out german bread, garden salad and rosti? Probably not enough kitchen staff... However, they were gracious enough not to charge us for it,Service staff also not attentive enough to top up water. When we mentioned we were there to celebrate a birthday and if there is any birthday special, we were answered by a curt 'no'. Hey a birthday wish to the birthday girl won't cost the restaurant anything.Seems crowded for a weeknight so be sure to make reservations
5
Probably the best wurst I have had since Germany and the Rosti was to die for. Portions are so generous that two of us shared the wurst with sauerkraut, mashed potato, crispy onions and onion gravy and had a side of rosti and it made the perfect lunch. Great outlook to the harbour as well and very good service. Wish we had found it a couple of days ago because the Wiener schnitzel looked great too and the person on the next table was really loving a huge plate of ribs
5
Crunchy pork with German sausage.
Wowowowo.
Keep that good job.
Serving speed is fast.
Environment relaxing with the the choice of indoor and outdoor.
4
One of the classical places to have german food and beer. Can try the sharing platter that offers a sample of each of their classics.
5
The iPad ordering system is great and the service is superb. This is a great place for breakfast as well as an afterwork drink and dinner.
4
We have eaten here many times over the years and it is always consistent.Snitz and potato salad was our choice this time, and it was delicious The prices have gone up though.Staff good, and because we ate earliesh we had no trouble getting a table.Well done, this is a good model
4
I stopped in for a quick meal and it was just that. After I placed my order I barely had time to sip my beer before the schnitzel arrived. Very big (plate size) and nice side dishes too. Normally I'd go a much bigger meal here but time was of the essence. It's a nice location with a good view and well worth a visit
4
Went Hereford dinner as was close to hotel. Glad we did, ordered the whole roast chicken which was amazing. Probably the tastiest roast chicken ive ever had. Prices are reasonable and is located just by Raffles. You order your food and drinks through a tablet at the table and for us the service was quick. Would recommend.
5
What a great place to eat dinner with the kids. The food was amazing and great prices for the food size. The pork Knuckles are sensational. The kids enjoyed themselves and treated so well by staff even though the restaurant was packed out for a Tuesday night.
3
The food quality is still good here. It's not superb, but decent food. I've been here 5 times over six years and it seems that the menu has become more Asian than German. I happened to arrive on a day where they were offering their once a week schnitzel menu, but without that the menu, as a whole, didn't give off a full German vibe. The sausage platters were about the only other thing that felt German-ish. Outside of that, the service has gone down. This was my first time going there since they implemented the iPad ordering system. The service, in my opinion, has gone down due to that. I had to flag people down for every bit of the process (have a question, get a refill on my water, get my check). No one ever stopped by to check how my meal was. The restaurant wasn't even a quarter full when I went there, so it's not like the servers were overly busy. While these electronic menus offer some benefits, the trend I see at most restaurants that use them is that the service suffers
5
A good location, outstanding service and great food - what more could you ask for? Oh... a good German beer? Sure! This dining experience rates as one my favourites. Having waded through the Pork Knuckle and the fine selection of flavoursome sausages I was more than full but it's hard to stop when you're enjoying yourself. I'll start my diet next week
5
Im actually writing this while im having my meal here XD today they actually having an event- CrisCosmo tour. The band is playing such amazing music even though i dont understand german XD It is a wonderful place to hang out with friends, really recommend it. The service is good and they're polite :
4
Great German and Austrian dishes on Singapore's riverside. Tasty pretzels, draft and bottled beers and good selection of sweets.
To recommend the Mixed board, which comes with three kind of cheeses, cured and cooked ham, speck, pickles, grapes, walnuts, bread and butter.
5
First time in Singapore & this place was close to our hotel. Very helpful & friendly, food good. Order your food/drinks on iPad at your table, very civilised. This restaurant was busy busy busy & a wonderful atmosphere, very casual & trendy, loved it.
4
Great food, cooked fresh. Excellent Service. They can accommodate Gluten free, and any other non standard menu requests too
5
Bringing family there ones a month for a good fix of German / Austrian food. Love the goulash, obatzda and Wiener Schnitzel.
I'm not much of a beer drinker but husband is, therefore always a good time with the whole family.
3
Good beer, reasonable sausage, pretty good pork knuckle in a typical mall location with reasonable service/value
4
Brotzeit is quite a good German themed restaurant in VivoCity, offering some German specialties and beers, service is better than in the other restaurants in this mall and food, although a little pricey, is also quite nice and the servings are generous.
4
We joined a friend here for a late afternoon beer and snacks. They have a decent selection of imported and locally brewed German style beer and somewhat authentic German dishes. We had the meat and cheese sampler plate which was good quality and tasty.You have the option of inside (aircon) seating and outside seating on the deck. Out of the deck you can get some views of the causeway, monorail and sky chairs linking the main portion of Singapore to Sentosa island, and the local ferry terminal. No problems with service
5
We always go to Vivo City for the big bowl of Goulash Soup.. and sit and watch the little Colourful trains go across to Sentosa And the Pork Knuckle meal is excellent alsoand the German beer Paulaner from Bavaria is just what you need We will be back in about 6 weeks time...
1
I dont get why this was busy when we went but the food is simply appalling... badly cooked and badly prepared. Not good value and taste. Nice location thought if you sit outside with a view. But overall experience is not good. Will not go back
4
This is a reasonably good South German restaurant. It provides a selection of more common German dishes. I had eaten here before (3 years ago) and at that time was amazed by the quality of the Wiener Schnitzel. On that occasion I would have rated 'excellent'. This time 'good' only, marred by slightly old/burnt oil. Their chefs need to take another look at German Kartoffelsalat as it was only marginally authentic (eg. lacking in onion. Still deserves a visit, with generally good service and food, generous servings, excellent German bread
5
Despite its shopping mall location it is a nice place to be and offers good Bavaria meals. Due to its smaller size service is easy and attentive. Will repeat.
5
Good German beer....Good choice of food and high quality.... Soups salads and pizza like snacks... Delicious deserts and coffee.... Always busy with families weekends always an indication of good food. Freindly and attentive staff.
5
The food and beer are very delicious. Staff is attentive and responds quickly. There is even outside seating for the smokers with a nice view of the harbor and Sentosa island.
5
I simply loved the food and drinks at this place
It was packed , but service was awesome and location was great
4
Especially if you get a table outside, the views are great, the beer and sausages are amazing. Worth the calories!
5
A platter of awesome meats and sausages. So good. Staff were brilliant too always smiling and helpful. Feinstein a place to visit if you like pork knuckle.
2
I come to Singapore very regularly and have often intended to try the magnificent looking oven roasted crispy Schweinhaxen at Brotzeit. Strolling past this evening, I spotted someone enjoying one and it looked very appetising! When mine came I immediately thought it looked slightly overcooked and, sadly, my first mouthful confirmed my fears. The 'crispy' skin, whilst not chewy, was certainly not crispy, and the fat and sinew, that characterises this dish, seemed to have mostly been overcooked away, resulting in a very poor imitation of the European original. The underlying meat, of which there was plenty, looked palatible, but had little flavour. I expect better of food, and cooking, in Singapore. Very disappointing
4
This is one of my favorite places in Singapore. It combines nice view of Sentosa Island with an extremely good European (German) food in South East Asia.All times we are sitting outside and could say its clean and quite despite the people moving around.The staff it is extremely helpful and always available to serve (Just above the typical Chinese way of serving) They also aware their catalog and ready to clarify all questions in this respect.They dot afraid to stop us from ordering by simply telling us that the plates are big and in the end if we still hungry they are available to order more!!
3
This used to be one of my favourites for a meat feast. But I will think twice from now on as the food quality and service level has deteriorated, especially the latter. Probably the business has been good lately, I am seeing arrogance amongst some of the servers. It is a pity. Furthermore the quality of the dishes has obviously dropped
4
Ordered the pork medallions wrapped in bacon - taste was nothing to shout about. Desserts were however quite good. I ordered a choux pastry stuffed with ice-cream while my galfren ordered ice-cream.Only disappointment was that the Ocktoberfest beer was not available when I ordered at 7pm. Felt that they should have catered for the high demand for this special yearly event
4
Fine food , good service and yes it is German. Usually you don't travel from Europese to Singapore to fine yourself but this is worthwhile.
5
The food was great, had a really good mixed pizza, and the draft beer really hit the spot. Will definitely keep this on my list for future eats!
5
We ordered platter meal for 4. Their sausages are the best. It is good combination with the white beer.
5
Had a business meeting here and was blown away by the great food and beer. Enjoyed the sampler platter with ribs, pigs knuckle, roasted chicken, and sausage. Good lager beer and lively ambiance. Come and enjoy!
4
Great restaurant! Fairly simply description but what a find. Great staff and awesome menu. The share plates are fantastic! Pork knuckle, sausage, ribs......say no more! As for sweets, fairly simple really.....beautiful!
4
Great place right in a busy shopping centre, staff were friendly and service good, food was served quickly and well cooked, reasonable prices. Would certainly recommend
4
If you like German food, this is a nice place to get that fix. Service at VivoCity is really nice and efficient, atmosphere al fresco is really nice with wonderful views. We had the seafood salad which was delicious, succulent seared tuna, smoked salmon, really generous portion; the sausage plate with mashed potato and sauerkraut (pickled cabbage) was quite big too, so was the currywurst (sausage in curry sauce) with potato wedges. The only disappointment was the pretzel (but I being Bavarian, I am spoiled), but otherwise a good place to go for those who are homesick and crave some rich food. Prices are not cheap though
4
Beer selection is great, the food is consistently high quality, the outlet at ViVoCity has a nice atmosphere, the service is pretty consistent and responsive... If you like beer and sausages, you really cannot go wrong... Only issue is the price, this place is not cheap! 2 people, a few beers and lunch, easily over S$100. Welcome to Singapore
4
'went there two times, because one time is not sufficient.first time i had the (must) pork knuckle and the second time the pork ribs. good quality. as i am not drinking alcohol the veltins non alcoholic beer was a good choice so was the geroldsteiner apple spritzer (some kind of apple juice with soda).our service was excellent. there is in particular one funny, attentive waitress who is not only doing her job
5
Wanted an early lunch and went into this restaurant just as it was opening at 11.30am. Been to several Brotzeits previously and the menu is essentially the same as the rest. However, additionally, there are set lunches at this restaurant at S$ 22, which I don't see for example at the Joo Chit outlet in Katong.I love the food here - was very happy with my choice. Good friendly service and comfortable bench seating. I asked for an especially cool table when I arrived, and I was put directly under the air-conditioning - so kind of them - loved it. Managed a quick lunch and off to my meeting. Highly recommended
5
I really like brotzeit. Pork knuckles, sausages are superb. Beer options are good. It's a little pricy but really enjoy dining there.
4
Really nice place. German restaurant with great food. Great place in Vivocity shoppingmall. AC inside and also tables outside. Nice view. Service was good.
3
Nice and easy German bar lunch , good all round effort and what you expect from a good German beer and food perspective , friendly staff , good background music
5
Yes, delicious German food in Singapore! Thought that was pretty amazing. The Nurnberger sausages I had were very authentic tasting. A very enjoyable casual dining experience and the beer was excellent, too.
4
We had a meeting with a client here in the evening. Great waterfront location and hence nice and cool. The place wasn't overly packed so we were able to continue our discussions but the service was a tad slow as we head to remind them a couple of times. Great ambience and variely of drinks.
5
After being in Singapore for almost a week and trying various local and asian-inspired cuisines, we wanted to look for something more European - a heavy and hearty meal. Luckily, Brotzeit was just next to our hotel and it was already around 10pm, but many people were still dining. They had a nice outdoor area facing the street and Raffles hotel. Of course not a single german feast can be without beer and they had a good selection! Since we were so active that day, we were super hungry and between four of us we shared their summer specialty - roast chicken with corn cob, and a more traditional crispy pork leg with classic german gravy and pickles. It was so delicious that we actually finished it all! Such a wonderful service and the waiter was always in high spirits to chat with us and accommodate our needs. In this restaurant you should forget about counting calories, but probably a good idea to start dieting after though.
4
Located by the waterfront this is a place to relax and unwind. Sit outside or in Ac inside Place has a pretty good range of German beers and a range of wines.The sausage platter and pork knuckle good Vaule .so are some of the puddings .Service good to
2
We struggled to find much in the local area at around 11pm on a friday night. This place was one of the few options. We had the fried camembert, which was quite good, and also the pizza for main course. The pizza was really poor. We ate half, paid and left
5
I love their pork knuckle its crispy on the outside, succulent in the inside and well seasoned. its simply the perfect pork knuckle served with german roast potatoes, and i always like to have some mustard on the side as well... they do have brunch as well and i like their salmon benedic
3
I've been visiting Brotzeit for years - it's a really great place for families where you know you'll get hearty food and some terrific beer.My favourite dishes have to be the pork knuckle - provided I can share it with some one. I love their Cheese Spatzle and their banana beer.However, I had a terribly disappointing experience last month at the VivoCity branch which I can only put down to a change of chef.One of my favourite dishes there is the veal goulash which comes with buttered spatzle. But this time it didn't resemble what I've had there before (as well as at their Glorietta outlet in Manila) The meat pieces were fewer but larger - and much tougher. The buttered spatzle lacked the butter and the crispiness on one side. I ended up eating less than half of it because it was too tough. My wife had a pork escalope which was very average although our guest had the currywurst, which she thoroughly enjoyed.Please give me back my old Brotzeit
5
Excellent food, the portion are copious which makes the place perfect for students and groups of friends. The place is a little bit noisy. Do not forget to book in advance or to arrive early.
4
Always a great place to take a break from Vivo, cheap good wine, caters for kids, outdoor and indoor space and excellent food and service. Always a great break from the hussle and bussle of Vivo. The view is excellent too.
4
Generous serving, great beer selection, nice ambiance too. Consistent from branch to branch but vivo offers a better vibe and options 's for seating
5
Thank you. Lunch box because there are big portions ! That's all very nice.
And it was not too hot at the terrace.
The view on the waterside is nice but smoking...
4
A busy restaurant with regular customers from offices and families, along with tourists. Wide selection of beer with a good promotion, other drinks are fine as well. Food taste is good with reliable variety to go well with the drinks and an ambience atmosphere.
3
A busy restaurant is a sign of a good restaurant. And it is the case here.I was drawn by the thought of an ice cold beer, then decided to have supper of steak. It was absolutely awesome.So, top marks for food, drink and service.The bench tables all seem to be for 6, which inevitably means you will end up sharing, but if you're a social animal, it's fun.Good menu, good value. Great atmosphere.
4
Just opposite Raffles you'll find Brotzeit. We stopped because they were advertising white asparagus which is usually only available for a short period of the year. We ordered the asparagus with roast beef, ham, poached eggs and hollandaise. The beef was cooked to perfection as was the asparagus. Washed that down with a good German bier and you won't go far wrong. Slight downside is there are only fans so not as cool in temperature as some places but otherwise I wish them luck. Their food is certainly worth a try
3
Visited the outlet at Vivo city and my bf and his mum.We ordered pork ribs, chicken and salmon this time round.We were amazed by the size of the pork ribs!!! It was huge and immediately we knew we over-ordered! Yes, we could not finish and had to takeaway. The chicken was okay only and there were a lot of potatoes. The salmon was over-cooked and it was very hard and dry! :( The dish was also filled with potatoes. We were very very full after that
4
Great selection of beer and very good food, all served with a smile. Serving sizes also way bigger than found in most Asian establishments. One of the group ordered a pork knuckle and had to take home a doggy bag. In fact when ordered we were asked by the manager, who took the order, if the rest of us were going to assist, with eating the knuckle
4
Been here a few times , first time I was here the food was incredible! Had a chicken dish that blew my socks off along with the pork knuckle ! However time has changed a lot of things, the dish is no longer available and the prices have gone up by quite a bit! Prices are around 50sgd per person! That only includes one beer! Recently went and had the deep fried camembert cheese which was really good! Ribs and schnitzel were tasty too but were served in pretty big portions so we couldn't finish and had no room to try the dessert which looks pretty good! the menu is constantly changing and my friend who had a very good cream based dessert that was served in a jar was very disappointed to learn that they had changed that too! A little consistency would be great! Will come back again for sure (:
2
Menu changes regularly, portions get smaller and prices go up. That's not how you score better in my book... Used to be 5*... Well, there are other options...
4
We really enjoyed the pizza and sausage. The Pork Knuckle and Ribs were a bit disappointed, lucky we went there for the sausage. Service was hit and miss
2
Food is pretty good. Specially main courses. Floor staff quite arrogant and lazy.
Will return to check improvements.
4
We dinner with friend.really nice please,the food is is really good and super.
I will come and recomend this place.
Great
4
If you are looking for simple German food with good beer selections, you cannot go wrong here. The outdoor seating is nice in the evenings.
5
I really enjoy the Brotzeit German Bier Bar & Restaurant in Singapore, and I have been to three branches of the restaurant. I love the knuckle and ribs, which are must tries!
4
the dark lager is fresh and delicious. i downed 2 pint. ordered the platter for 5 of us, enough to make us full. pork knuckle really nice. crispy outside and soft inside with the porky flavour. assorted sausages are just good, i mean no german bar can screw up the sausages one. the breaded pork chop is no good. when i sliced it, the bread crust and the port was separated. no elegant and the taste is bland. come with 3 sources, chilli and hot mustard is good. the sweet mustard i am just not a fan.floor staff service is fine
5
Start with German beer! Then move to the meat and cheese tray, and finish with a Schweinshaxe. The place always has a wait. Never been disappointed once seated. It is open air seating............so in the heat order the 0.5 litre beer so id does not get warm. Of just drink quickly
3
Arrived in Singapore late in the evening and popped into restaurant for drink and something to eat. A good selection of beers and we hit 'Happy hour' which was good for us. My wife and l both ate there and it was distinctly average., perhaps we ordered the wrong things but our dishes did not have a wow factor and service seemed very slow.If l wanted a good German beer then yes it is good but my experience of the food made it average
5
This place is always good whenever I have a craving for sausages and sauerkraut. Service is also friendly. There are both indoor and outdoor sitting areas but I personally prefer the outdoor area as you get a view of the waterfront, which is nice for a relaxing happy hour.
4
At 7 and 8 Jan Good to go there twice with my parents at around 10:30pm All of us enjoyed their beer and atmosphere was great ... Location is very nice as close to our Fairmont hotel, definitely will go again.
5
Sounds funny - but yes i am german and yes i went to a german restaurant in Singapore...It was the last day and this restaurant was soo close to our hotel :)It is really good! I must admit some food was better prepared than some restaurants in germany...as usualy asians, loads of decoration on the plate. large beer assortment as well (obviously expensive)Give it a shot :) it is good
3
We enjoyed the wonderful German beer selection and food overall, however, you are not able to expect the high level of service because the staffs are so busy, but we highly appreciated their assistance during our meal. We will come back and enjoy other foods and beers, though
4
I'm here for the pork knuckle with my friends and it is a great place to sit down and chil and chat. Rare to find crispy pork knuckle in Singapore. Taste great as usual but not as my expectation somehow. My friend share it is good to try once the german style pork knuckle as experience. overall it is a decent meal and it get crowded at weekend evening
1
The worst customer service I have ever experienced, which was a big surprise seeing as Singapore is renowned for its excellent customer service. Then the food came out, stone cold. Let the manager know and she didn't charge us for it which was nice, also told her she needs to get new staff. Very disappointing

We ate at the busy Katong branch last week after a visit to the cinema, the TA reviews are good but I was not very impressed. The fish dish was not great and straight out of the freezer, you will love it if beer/sausages/meat is your preference. Staff were doing their best but even at 10pm could have done with more help
5
Having a German husband I gave in to having dinner here. Not everything on the menu is sausage and sauerkraut. After three days of dumplings it was nice to enjoy a well cooked steak and veg and have a great beer and Austrian red wine. Good service and good buzz
4
Our second visit to this fine restaurant. The atmosphere is great and the location. It is always full, so if you do not have a booking you might need to wait for a bit. Good German food. But today the lamb sausage dish with mash potatoes and sauerkraut was just average. The menu states it comes with mash, sauerkraut and red cabbage but today was two portions of sauerkraut and the lamb sausages was not really good, quite spicy and with sinews, so not that good. Other family members had the fladen, the one was really a bit boring. The beer though is good. Our first time was for lunch and their are dishes on the lunch menu which we prefer. Be willing to pay $200 for a family of four. But still oka

Had supper at Brotzeit in Raffles City during a 2 day stopover. Had noticed it was always busy when we walked past so decided to try it out. My husband had the pork knuckle which was tasty, and a huge portion. I had the ribs, which I found very over-spiced. Unfortunately couldn't taste the rib at all, just the sauce. Pity. Very nice chips.Would have given it a better overall score had the ribs been better. A number of people sitting near us has sausages, which looked good.Service was prompt
3
nice ambience, good beers but average foodgo for platter for valuefeeds 4 pple well but its more for fixing hunger than any real culinary pleasureas usual nice selection of draft beersbut overall not cheapaverage hangout placesausages are good but still they are sausage
5
Whenever in Singapore this is one of my stops! I love the sauerkraut and sausages that they have available on the menu. And there is a good selection of German beers. Service was good and once ordered the food came out reasonably fast.
4
Brotzeit is always full house and people waiting in line outside. It's a good restaurant, I like Germany food, always in big portion, we tried the rib and sausages. Sides were of high quality as well, even the complementary ones.
4
I had a pork knuckle hear about a week ago and washed it down with 2 pints of German brew. The food was very good, service also very good, prices Ok and beer was also good.
5
They got all type of beer here a good bog glass is around Sin$ 8-9. Good good too and nice view of the street for people watching :-)
4
Nice location, good food and friendly stuff!
Really worth it to visit.
Prizes for the food absolutely ok - for all beverages too expensive I think...
That's the only thing complain.
4
This is a nice bar with good service, the food is good quality and not too expensive. Over all i would recommend this bar as a quick bite to eat
5
You can enjoy nice German beer and foods. It is perfect taste as in Germany. but a bit expensive but reasonable in SG.
5
Excellent German food! The service is quick, the staff is friendly. The location of the restaurant is excellent, just opposite of the Raffle Hotel.
4
It might seem strange to go to a German restaurant while in Singapore, but the food and the beer selection are fantastic. There are more than one location, but we went to the Brotzeit at Vivo City down by the water and sat outside with a view of Sentosa Island, which was great
5
Visited this wonderful joint post office hours and was quite happy with overall experience. It's bit expensive but definitely a high quality. loved their selection of fresh beers and food we ordered was just so delicious, my personal favourite were sausages with potato wedges, do try the msg too it's so goo
4
An OK German experience with all the typical beers, sausages and sauerkraut. Staff were attentive. Catered to the kids with activity books and safer cutlery.
5
Never never missed my pork knuckle and my 1 litre mug Bier .Yum to the max!!
Love the atmosphere at the Vivo City outlet, as its overlooking Resort World Sentosa. Cheers!
4
Yum, Yum, Yum......great food, great service and beautiful beer.
Was totally unexpected in the middle of busy Singaporean shopping centre!!!
The red cabbage was so yum!!!
5
Love the cheese pork sausages with cabbaged you must try!
#friendlywaitingstaff#delicious#quickservice#niceview

I never go to Brotzeit without reserving a table. This place can get quite crowded - and why not - the pork knuckles are out of this world. Wash it down with their speciality lagers, and call it a merry night.
4
I stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. I had the special which was a cordon Blue Weiner Schnitzel. The food was tasty and I had never had a cordon blue style Schnitzel before and I did enjoy it. However, It was a little dryer that I would have liked.The German bier was excellent though!
4
We had dinner here as a group of 5 + 2 kids and we ordered a platter to share. Been there for meals on numerous occasions, and I must say the standard of the food has been constantly good. And the pork knuckle is always a must-order. A wide range of beers to choose from as well, it is definitely a good place for gatherings with families and friends
1
My husband and I have been going to this restaurant for 2 years. My husband is German, we found the food very authentic and taste was good.However, 3 out of 4 times, whenever I went to this restaurant, I had stomachache and slight diarrhea. I stopped going there for a while and only returned again last week. I had the same problem and my husband who was there few days ago ate a seafood salad and had upset stomach for the whole day.I usually have pork dishes and some salad. I think it is not a coincidence. I strongly recommend the management to look into the hygiene or food distribution standard because we love German food and the taste was good.I have also been a couple of times to the other Brotzeit branches in Singapore and I did not have this problem
2
Dropped by for lunch last weekend. Food and beer was good. But was surprised at the bad table manners of a service staff. Granted, it was only that one guy. All other staff were courteous, and we also had to understand as there were quite a few diners around. This one guy was terrible though. Hard to imagine in such a well-known chain. He couldn't be bothered when we asked about our beer, even looked away and seemed bored. After that, he hung around the counter and ignored other diners, preferring to chat with the bartender. When he walked past, I raised my hand to call for the bill, and he glanced at me and went on his merry way. Such a shame for a place that has such potential
4
So, my friends who live in Singapore suggested this venue. We sat outside and had a very nice vista over the water, just a shame they allow smoking in the outside area where people are eating (something Australia have got very right, no smoking where eating food). Anyway, we ordered awesome ribs for starter to share, they were spot on. Nicely flavoured, not drowned in some sugary sauce either. Spot on. Then I got my pork knuckle with sauerkraut, potato salad and a side of green beans. It was nearly great, just let down a little by the fact only half the skin had crackled. The meat though was moist, fell off the bone and was well done. Service was attentive, and my friend had the sausages which were great as well and assorted flavours, similar sides. he had wedges, which were really good, and I dont usually like wedges. Condiments came with all the food, all up give it a go if you have a hankering for Pork Knuckle
4
The pork knuckle was well roasted with crispy skin like that of suckling pig while the meat remain moist and juicy. The assortment of sausages were distinctively flavoured. The sauces enhanced the flavour without overpowering the basic taste. The Dunkles was riched and malty.
4
Been to a couple (Somerset and Raffles city) nice food and a consistent standard, with a menu with something for everyone. Good selection of German beers, draught and bottled. Always busy, but never waited too long.
1
Have been here for a beer before but this time I had a meal. Selected the mixed cold platter in the photo there was brie and camenbet cheese but when it arrived there was cheddar and some cheap hard cheese and the meat was cheap cuts of ham.The beer was not that cold either
5
We went with friends who had booked an outside table at 7pm which was perfect. If you want such a table then book ahead as everyone seems to want the same. The meal choices were many and of course Bavarian mostly. The Pork and Cheese sausages were fantastic and the Pizzas interestingly good with their bases made from Rye Bread thin. Beers were nice and cold although as is usual in Singapore you need to take out a mortgage if you want to drink a lot at $25 a litre. Not a cheap place as overall with drinks it was S$250 for 4 people the food prices seemed reasonable though but was a lovely night and we would certainly go agai
1
Went here and ordered Schnitzel and my wife had a sausage plate. Sausa were old and not tasty, like they have been heated up. My Schnitzel was deep fat fried. I don't know what people post here but if this food is good... then I must be in heaven when eating in Germany. Don't know where they get their cooks from but obviously not from Germany. Any mid aged German knows how to cook these basic foods. I'm not a cook but my cooking which I learned from my grandma is way better than this. Ihave bbeen to 3 German places to eat and not one made it above 1 star. Guess Singaporeans and other foreigners who never had a decent German meal will consider this good but for me as a German, I can only tell you... it's not!! Bad food, high prices, unfriendly staff and long waiting times for ordering as well as getting the food is the worst place I have been to in a long time

Seven of us had a midweek lunch here , not very busy. Vivo restaurant is in a great location , recommend sitting outside with the good view of Sentosa. Staff moved fans to keep a nice breeze going. Specific Vivo location gives a lot of different mid to high price restaurants nearby all offering indoor / outdoor sitting , so a lot of menu choices.We all really enjoyed ourselves. Service was good and friendly. Varied German food on offer . If you are looking for meat ..heaven..The platter for 3 , pork knuckle and sausages was excellent. The curry werst and schnitzel also recommended. Big portions and well cooked.Prices high but quality , location and service made it worthwhile
1
We are from Germany and wanted to try this restaurant! Be cautious, it has nothing to do with German quality!Went there in order to try the Black Forest German type of pizza:- was terrible, not fresh crust, over cooked, obviously cooked in advance, low end quality cheese without flavor- the waiter did not want to refund and cancel the order though it was obviously not eatable if not a scam as not as advertised on the menu- as an unacceptable alternative, he suggested to heat it up again in the oven in order to try melting the cheese again, just not professional!We left without eating and will never be back to what was the biggest scam in town since we came to Singapore 5 years ago. At the same time, we will cancel our company corporate event planned at this restaurant for Oktoberfest.See attached picture, it speaks by itself
4
The food is like in germany. So i mean the food is very delicious. The staff's are very friendly to. But just one thing is the price. The price is very high and even one glass of beer is really overpricedBut as said the food is fantastic
5
its been a while since we spotted this restaurant and finally got the time to try.... we shared our table with another party and was limited till 20.00 because the table is already reserved (i really recommend you to reserved first)we ordered the brotzeit platter (pork knuckle, sausages, beef goulash with 2 side dishes) for 3 people and turns out it can feed a company! hahahhaha the plate was sooo big it makes us full just by seeing it.... the pork knuckle is very crispy and juicy, i think its one of the best pork knuckle ive tried (trust me i tried enough to judge) we really didnt know how generous their portion is so we also ordered few more dish, the service is not so good, the waiters didnt have enough knowledge about the food and it took a long time just to order some mineral water refill....
4
The Brotzeit is the place to go if you need some good German food in Singapore. The Leberwurst is very authentic, the curry wurst couldn't be better in Berlin and the service is great - even with some German service members. The only reason for only 4 points is the price but the prime location and quality of food makes up for it. So go there and enjoy some German hospitality, great food and good German beer when in Singapore
5
Great food, great service and so much food that its worthy of a repeat visit, but with more time next time
4
German dishes and beer served outside on the terrace with a view to Sentosa - or inside in the air-con.
Well prepared and nicely served concept food of German style.
Highly recommendable when you need something else than rice and local dishes :)
4
Haven't try the food yet, but always taking the time for a tasty pint of Münchner Lager here every time I went to SG.
4
Very happy that they have opened an outlet in Katong. Food is always good. Good German beers. This outlet normally has a good crowd. Love the pork medallion and the pork sausages. Actually you would love most of it if you were a meat eater.
4
We were a party of ten, five adults and 5 children age range 4 months to 8 years. Furniture was moved to accommodate the baby's buggy. One of the four year olds, normally very fussy, devoured her sausages and mash. The eight year old, not used to adult salads, enjoyed her meal and the other two justified what was on their plates. The vanilla ice cream was the best ever according to Grandma! The adult portions are over generous, thank goodness we didn't order starters. The food was tasty, well cooked and presented. A great family meal and venue. Pointers: children's food ordered first and brought while the adults enjoyed their drinks. An activity sheet filled in time for the children, though we could have done with a few extra pencils. The only downside was the children ordered their ice cream at the start, the two year old wanted hers at the outset! Staff very accommodating of little children making a noise and spilling water etc. Certainly recommend this restaurant, adult only groups kept apart from noisy families
2
We came here for dinner after several recommendations but we were so disappointed! We ordered the pork Snitzel shich was large enough for sharing but very tough chewy and not good quality meat. Ordered the spinach on the side and it ended up being green pasta!! At the end of the meal the waitress asked if we enjoyed the meal and we told her the faults.... when we got the bill they didn't charge for the green pasta. Don't bother coming here, don't be fooled by the inticing waiter outside luring people in, go somewhere else! The pork Snitzel was bad quality. Not recommended
5
This German Beer Bar and Restaurant is right next to Marche on the corner of Bras Basah Rd and North Bridge Rd but you could tell the difference by the patronage.Beer in both places is good and well chilled but the food makes all the difference.Be careful as the meals are large and very tasty so you can order too much, but it will be worth it
5
Again we found ourselves on a Sunday dinner at Brotzeit Katong branch .... Given a table immediately and was served by courteous friendly YK ; DWe ordered the mixed platter that comes with goulash beef ... @ S$72 g. o. o d. Value for money ... On top of this is the wonderfully well cooked CRISPY succulent tender pork knuckles drowned with the well brewed dark bier you find yourselves in 7th heaven forgetting about dieting if we want to enjoy this specialty. This comes with the new side dish of green pasta and spinach. Another side dish was also given. To complete this platter a mixed variety of sausages are added to our hearty meal
4
The food is really good almost like your eating in Germany. The staff was very friendly because they gave the kids free ice-cream. But the only thing is the price. The price is verrrry high and some cant even stand it!!! If you dont mind the high price then i would highly recommend you brotzeit if you want to eat good german food in singapore

My friends and I ate here for the first time last Tuesday at the Somerset branch. We asked to be seated at the second level for a more quiet environment. We should have gotten the hint that the dishes they serve come in big portions and are meant to be shared from the plates that were set on the table. Each of us unwittingly placed our orders and were subsequently overwhelmed by the amount of food that arrived. Their seafood salad is one of the most balanced-tasting salads that I have ever tasted. Their side dishes are very reasonably priced at the portion that they come. The sausages are great. My friend was so impressed by their very simple and smooth mashed potato. To me it was just normal. (I prefer the lumpier, herb-infused kind). I was way happier with the buttered spÃ¤tzle. :)My only two complaints are that 1.) The salads are too generously drizzled with olive oil (maybe that's why they're so tasty!) making the greens turn soggy in no time; and 2.) the sauerkraut is not sour at all, as I'm normally accustomed to. I suppose these are subjective complaints as each customer prefers dishes in different ways. Overall, it was a good experience
4
Although seated as a beer garden this little bit of Germany is styled to the Singapore/Australian taste. Food is good and the beer is even better. Staff know their food very well and the international menu has pictures……
4
Good fun to experience. Nice nibbles, good array of beer and small selection of wine. Bit on expensive side but over road from Raffles, Chijmes and Carlton so great location and good for a beer after shopping and in th hot weather.
3
Food quality is not very high. Beer did sometimes taste strange, probably due to detergent used for dish washing.
For value for money the prices are too high.
4
If you like German nosh, this place is the place to go to. German bier and themes to boot. Priced nicely as well.
5
Ask for a table outside facing sentosa if you can. Be prepared for lack of attention from service staff and wrong beer orders
4
This is a place I always turn to when I run of ideas as to where to eat. It serves good salads, good meat dishes and a good beer selection.
I love the cosiness of this restaurant.
4
Very good austrian and bavarian food, munich beer from the tab, very good austrian wines, lively place, watch F1 or football if you wish, in and outdoor sitting available
4
What I loved most about Brotzeit was the view. The restaurant faces the Singapore river and at night gives a perfect view of the bejeweled Sentosa on the other side. We were among the last ones to leave and therefore had a calm, silent dinner by the river. The food is honest, greasy German fare. The iced latte we ordered with it was underwhelming.Overall, a beautiful experience
3
I like to go from time to time to eat some of my native cuisine. So I went to the newly renovated/opened Brotzeit at VivoCity. The food is still consistent but not really great, especially if you are from Germany. Tables were packed and it was a good mix of people there. The view towards Sentosa is really nice. The food was not as good as it was before. A bit smaller portions (that is important for us;-) and less tasty. The worst thing however was that they forgot one dish completely and later had to run it out of the kitchen fast. Unfortunately, they served this pork dish kind of medium rare. The manager apologized and offered us free coffee that later was charged in full. I have the feeling the place was better when it was still a startup. Now it is too commercial.
5
We stayed in Singapore four three nights and eat our dinner at Brotzeit all three evenings because:* When we came there the first evening when the restaurant was full and we asked the staff for vacant table it did not take long before they had managed to get tables for 18 people.*All the food that was served to us was extremely good and quickly served*Very helpfull staff, spesially Anisa
5
Comfort food the german/ Austrian way - my favourite branch is raffles city,they just renovated.
My top favourites are the Gulash with additional napkin dumpling and the Wiener schnitzel with potato salad.Also the kaisersschmarrn is very delicious.
4
Love the place for its wonderful location , awesome food and great beers.
They serve authentic bavarian dishes.
Love coming back to this place.
5
Definitely I am going back to this place which serves a good variety of German draught beer, my favourite pork knuckles, sausages and pork ribs. Everything that was ordered was perfectly cooked. Quite surprised with portions of food served.
5
having had many holidays in Germany and enjoyed lots of amazing food, we went here with low expectations, however we were blown away, perfectly cooked authentic dishes, great range of unusual German beers and warm and friendly service, we will be back often!
4
I'm not a beer expert first of all. For me, beer is beer. I had 3 kinds of it here starting from the most popular one to the darker blends. Then a glass of wine.I forgot the names, sorry, but the most popular beer blend would probably agree best with "beer-ginners" (beginners) as it has a very light, refreshing taste to it. Much like soda. The darker blends are quite bitter but my friends seem to like them more.To each, his own, I say. The good thing with this place is you can pick whatever suits your taste and you won't run out of drinks to order.Cheers!
4
This place is a must for meat lovers ! The service was friendly and helpful and the wait staff even advised us against ordering 3 sets for each of us. For $100 ( including taxes ), the table was almost overflowing filled with 2 set meals of Pork knuckles and Honey Ribs, each with generous side dishes. The spicy thick goulash is acquired taste but goes well with sauerkraut. Service can be slow with staff but friendly always. I was glad I made a reservation because the beer and restaurant section was packed on that Saturday night
4
Brotzeit is one of my favorite go-to places to eat in SG, with my favorite branch being the one in Vivo. (I'm not sure how many branches they have, but tried out the one in Star Vista and Somerset). I would say the one in Vivo not only has better service, but also much better ambiance. I would say the portions are rather big for SG standards, so it may be quite a value for money. My favorite would be the BBQ pizza and the dumpling appetizers
5
Thought Harbourfront has the best view, I prefer this friendly branch which does not required long waiting even on Friday nights. Though the main highlight is the German beer but food is the reason I go back for. Go with 3 friends and order their signature platter which comes with German sausages, pork knuckle and 2 side dishes. That will be enough for 4 & leave some room for dessert. For better deal, join their Reward card member which include 10% off total bill, complimentary birthday treat. Now they service breakfast from 9am -11:45am on sat & Sun @Katong branch. Can't wait to tr
5
Who is longer time in Asia and misses European food, especially german food. The service is great and fast, the food tastes great. For a asian level of course not cheap, but it is worth it. As a top on you will get a cold german beer
5
Probably one of most authentic German food restaurant in Singapore. Sausage and Schweinshaxe were must-have. The size of dishes was absolutely more German standard, not local standard. Don't order too many dishes. $80 for dishes of goulash soup, salad, sausage with sauerkraut, Schweinshaxe, and beer. And it was very too much for 2 persons
5
Very authentic, even if a bit expensive. Here are some more characters to fill out the rest of the required number of characters.
4
If you want to get away from Asian food, then this could be your choice !! Lovely German food accompanied with German Beer and Schnapps. What is there more to wish for. Enjoy !!
4
The Ripper Platter of knuckle, ribs and sausages with 2 sides (our choice was the sauerkraut and roast potatoes)served up the right variety of popular German fare and portion for 4 of us. Accompanied by biers which were on the light side. I would give our main a 4 rating.The Nachspeisen Teller Platter of ice cream on crepes, strudel, chocolate fondant and fruits was a 4.5 out of 5 rating treat. Despite being quite stuffed after the main and the beers, we cleaned out the platter. The strudel was fresh and warm, and none of the items was too sweet.We had a table outside which offered a magnificent view of Sentosa lights across the waters. The weather was perfect, not at all balmy.The place was packed with diners out with family / friends on a Friday evening, heralding the weekend - there was almost a festive air about it.The service crew was friendly but in the bustle, we had to ask three times for some ice water. Overall, we enjoyed the evening very much.(We arrived at 730pm and had to wait for about 20 mins in the queue for a table - so I reckon it's best to make a reservation, esp on weekends)
4
Really cool varieties of German Draught beer! Pork knuckle is one of my favorites. I have tried all KL and Bangkok branches also. "Should go" place if you crave for German Draught and nice food. Good service and a little high price in Singapore but fair in KL and Bangkok
4
I had one of the daily dinner specials. It was described as "sliced roast beef with fried potatoes and tomato and spinach salad". What came out was effectively two minute steak sized slices of very tasty and tender Striploin roast (entrecote if your old fashioned like me) with a very tasty salad and a not so great interpretation of Bratkartoffeln (roasted potatoes with onions). Had they put the potatoes on a hot pan for 2 minutes before serving they whole thing would have gotten 5 stars but they didn't so I've marked it down. The staff were friendly and very accommodating even when I decided to make my own Affogato rather than choose one of the house desserts. Total cost for dinner dessert and a large bottle of sparkling water was $54 or 36 Euros .. You could go a lot cheaper here if you opted for Pizza but I didn't and I'm happy about that
4
You will not be surprised by the menu and yes, they are goos, even though the servera were a bit gloomy,maybe from being hectic, the pork knuckle was good, but onion soup was salty,the portion was huge even for the small size, good choice for big eaters
4
as we were in the Katong district we saw the Brotzeit and decided to go in. it was about 930pm or so and it was 3/4 full however the service was prompt and we ordered two wines , an entrÃ©e snd a main meal. all very well served and very fresh and tasty the white wine was perfectly chilled service was good and for slightly over $100 wbich included $44 for two glasses of wine so a little pricey for a house pour no name bran
4
Long business day I was honestly not looking forward to the invitation for dinner to a place called Brotzeit in a busy shopping centre.What a pleasant surprise to have comfortable outdoor seating close to the Water very friendly, cheerful staff great selection of not only all kinds aof beers, but good wine and food. All that is priced reasonably and of high quality.I would definitely go bac
3
Walking thru Singapore when shopping, you see all the great foodcourts with all kinds of fastfood and deliscious asian food. As a european you have to try them. Everything is great. Then I was verry pleasant surprised when I saw brottzeit. Immediatly we went in I wanted to experiance a german restaurant in Singapore. It was nice, but not as good as in Germany. The schnitzel was a bit dry, the frites tasted ok. But The veggie's were super nice. This was first time in my life that I ate Brussels sprouts and realy liked them. All and all a surprisingly pleasant experiance
3
We got seated outside with the kids who found the heat a bit much to handle over a hot meal. Service wasn't anything special considering other eating places in Singapore.Food was nice, nothing special compared with our experiences with other German restaurants we've visited.Probably wouldn't go back next time we are in Singapore would try a different German restaurant
4
The food here is fairly good with an excellent Holzfaller steak at a reasonable price.
The view across the bay is great
The only downside was the beer. Having drunk Paulaner beer in Germany this was not that good
4
There are several Brotzeits in Singapore and all of them share the same great menu with generous portions and reasonable price. The service in Singapore is always included and the waiters are very quick. The Brotzeit in Vivo City is the one with the best view from Sentosa Island. The Curry Sausages with Sauer Kraut are super and so are their huge salads, and their selection of beers are superb! When coming during happy hour be prepared to wait for a while. It's a great place with family and friends
4
As a family we all generally love going to any outlet however stopped going as frequently when they raised their beer prices by about 30% overnight. Was enticed back when they started a new HH 1 for 1 deal which was great only to later find out that they had ceased the offer without a replacement offering. Now again one of the most expensive beers in Singapore. Not a good customer experience
4
Was in Singapore for a week for business and a colleague suggested we catchup with partners at Brotzeit in Vivo City. Great spot looking across to Sentosa Island across the water. I hadn't figured on German food in Singapore but it didn't take long to get into the beers outside on the verandah, and the sausages, schnitzels, salads and more beers just disappeared. After we discovered the centre was open til late we shopped til evening and then did a return visit for dinner. If you are a "westerner" hankering for some European food in a sea of rice and pork you'll find Brotzeit a comfort food refuge :-
4
colleagues brought us here for lunch treat. was not crowded but no indoor seats. we ordered the 3 in one combo porkribs, knuckles, etc. quite big serving, think order side dish like the german vege & potatoes, enough for 6 of us. if you like german food, this is not bad
3
This must be one of the few German restaurants where you can find all over the sunny island of Singapore. Brotzeit has built a name for itself by being easily accessible with many branches set up in 6 locations in various parts of Singapore, most of them located near MRT stations; offering good quality German food and beer. This particular branch of Brotzeit is located at Vivocity on the ground floor. Here you can find a good mix of locals and foreigners. Ambience wise is rather similar to a typical restaurant you can find in Germany. We had quite a number of people in my group that day, so we occupied a few tables. Our appetisers were made up of Bavarian Cream Cheese, Crunchy Bacon and Apple Spread, and Smoked Salmon Tartare with chives, all served with German bread. This is quite heavy by itself and if you’re hungry at this point of time, be sure to control yourself as the main courses are what will be worth waiting for. Next came the Mozarella salad to ensure a well balanced diet with some fibre in our digestive system. What meal is complete without a pizza? So next came the spinach and vegetarian pizza which we kind of regretted as they were not as tasty as we had expected them to be. We had the sausage platter, which came with sauerkraut. Not to miss out the pork knuckles. Because of our large numbers we could order a few to share. The sausages were fairly decent, with various kinds ranging from spicy chicken, grilled pork, pork cheese, pork and veal and garlic pork. My favourite was the spicy chicken, which was tasty and didn’t have too much fat or tendon content in it. One portion of pork knuckles will be too much for 1 person, but sufficient for 2-3 people. The pork knuckles was a tad little disappointing. I’m not sure why but the meat was a little too dry compared to the pork knuckles I had before in Germany. The meat was also tough to cut despite having a meat knife. However the pork skin was crispy like it should be. Perhaps this particular dish was left too long in the oven or not marinated well enough. I didn’t drink beer that day but my friends who did commented on the lack of variety of German beers. The bill didn’t come up cheap for the food we had. However we did fill our bellies to the maximum with dessert which consisted of apple strudel, chocolate cake, crepe and ice cream. Overall 3 stars for this experience
5
Excellent German crispy Knuckles juicy inside n w every bite I get that crunchy crispy flavorful grrr grrr sound - yum! Mixed with their own secret spice served with sour kraut n eaten with djion mustard, it is really satisfying with their German dark bier. If u want to have t view o t sea u can dine alfresco.A few tables inside also have a good view o the sea. Waiters n waitresses r attentive n food s good.Money well spent
4
When you want good meat and beer, you can always count on Brotzeit, tried ribs at several outlets and only Katong made the cut for the best ribs ever, juicy and delicious. For the less carnivous personalities, the seafood salad will be a good fit. The fried cheese is so good, do not remove it from the menu! All good meal must end with desserts, and Brotzeit dessert is not for the faint hearted, it is like CHristmas that came early! Served on the signature log-like platter and you get fruits, cakes, crepes, and ice cream! Always very happy after that! Definitely go back again and again

Met up with friends last month for a meal n drink. The portion are huge for just 3 of us with beer. Love the just enough chilled beer choice. The pork knuckle is roasted till the right crisp. Sausages are nice too! Dont order the platter if u are less than 4pax. (Even thought the price n variety are just great, as u would hv prob finish it up. Saw pax of 3 struggling to finish it.)

I first visited the Katong branch this August for my birthday celebration with my family. What impressed me most was the succulent pork knuckles and the juicy bratwurst sausages that we ordered. We also had a nice accompaniment of their orange flavoured draft beer, which was smooth and light. It was indeed a hearty meal for all of us and is truly one of the highly recommended places to dine in
3
Beautiful and fresh German food for an average price.
Check out their (lunch) specials on the table as the staff doesn't always refer to it!
5
As usual i stopped in the vivocity location and it was great. nothing like good german beer and food. I highly recommend the pork knuckle which was prepared perfectly. Crispy on the outside and falling off the bone soft on theinside
4
Try to get a table outside. Don't order the MAss (1 litre) unless you are a fast drinker because otherwise the beer is getting too warm
4
After 2 weeks of being in China, this was a welcome sight. Simple German food and beer.
Good service, cold beer and good food
5
We had steak and pork medallions plus generous helpings of chips mushrooms etc. Meat was tender and juicy, chips tasty, sauces tangy. Alas we were too full to go for the sweet menu. The beer was cold and foaming. You will not be disappointed
3
The servings are quite large by Singapore standards and typically we would order 1 main dish and a side for the both of us. I have tried just about every type of beer they have and I like all of them. Service standards are average in the VivoCity branch, though we've encountered terrible service in their 313 Somerset branch on several occasions
2
As always, German beer never disappoint. I ordered Weissbier and it's so smooth and still nice even after it gets warm.As always, service is Singapore is terrible. We were sitting at 2 tables (combined) cos there were 6 of us. Different waiter and waitress kept coming to us and saying that we can't sit till 6, cos the table is reserved. Huh? We're paying customers and treated like beggars. Finally one of them come by and said it's ok to stay, they'll give the guests who booked the table another table. Duh!When we finally ready to go and called the bill, we had to wait half an hour to actually got the bill. Asked 3 different waitress and all of them just walked us by.Maybe I just catch them in a bad day. But still, it left a really bad impression.As for the food, it's meh. Ordered Ripperl (?) Platter and it's nothing special (especially seeing that's it's German)
3
Both the food and beer was good (when it arrived). We had to track down a waiter to take the order and waited a long time for the drinks to arrive. It was good to sit outside and watch the world go by with Sentosa in the background. The food was very good although on the expensive side which seems to be the norm in Singapore if the place is frequented by expats.We had to track down a waiter to order fresh drinks and again for the bill.Maybe we caught them on a bad night but they definitely could do with more staff
2
We were a group of 12 and initially requested for indoor seating. It's a Friday night and was told outdoor seating are the only one available. The aircon is not working neither is the outdoor fan and with the humid weather it's get very hot. The gave us 2 tables for 12 people which can only seat 6 small size women in a squishy manner. Like what others would do, we ask for additional seats. The waitress immediately became defensive and insist we squeeze ourselves together. We insist to get the chairs so we can eat properly but the waitress apparently called her host. The host acted in a very annoyed manner and asked us to put out our bags so we can squeeze. I mean you expect us to put our bags on the floor? What a horrible service. They eventually gave us bench for our guys to seatm i mean they are just chairs, had they explained why they cannot give extra chairs we could have understand but to instruct your customers to dont make the bags sit, so how do you expect people to eat? The waitress serving drinks are spilling it all over the place. While saying it's self service. Kindly pass around. What? I thought we are paying service charge? It's not even worth to pay service charge for a horrendous poor service with staffs with horrible attitude towards their customers! Food is expensive for such a lousy service. Will never go back!! On a bright note, the ang mo waitress is commendable. Probably the only person who understands the meaning of service in a service industry.

Had a good meal at Brotzeit recently. I am amazed how sausages could taste this good, particularly love their spicy sausages and cheese sausages.... Its really very good! They also had a set lunch deal when i visit so ordered a set of pork escalope and comes with a ham roll wrap with potato cheese salad. Pork escalope is normal, nothing to shout about but love the ham roll, the potato cheese salad is very creamy. We sat at their outdoor seating facing sentosa and love the view. Even though its 1pm in the afternoon but the breeze is great and dont feel the heat at all... had a good dining experience.More pics and review:http://eatplaycook22.blogspot.sg/2014/06/play-and-eat-day-out-at-vivocity-and.htm

I recommend to try their pork sausages. The taste is great! Will back again for dinner on my next trip on July 2014.
4
If beers, sausages & pork knuckles rock your boat, this is one of the better, if not best dining places for German food.
4
Love this place for breakfast but can get very busy at diner time. Great food and beer. Atmosphere is good and the staff were friendly and polite. Cheap too
4
I like their locations in Singapore and ambience. Tried pork knuckles and sausages that come with big platter which can serve 4-5 adults. Very yummy and tasty. Food servers are friendly and attentive.
3
Therefore I am not sure if I visit again. Venue: 5/5 - lovely wood finish and benches to sit on with inside and outside seating. Good views of the lights and water.Service: 4/5 - was good overall. Took long to get the billFood: 3/5 - obasda was creative and enjoyed with a pretzel and free basket of breads. The cod fish was nice but lacked flavor and served in narrow plate. Lamb shank was lacking flavor also. Value: 3/5 - priced on the higher end. Really felt I spent lots for an average experience.
3
Visited this restaurant on a business trip in Singapore. Atmosphere is lovely and we sat on the patio. Food is good but nothing amazing. Actually fairly expensive for what we got but it isn't the worst business meal I've ever had. Service was also quite slow for a not very full restaurant
1
I have been coming here for 6 years. Always had great service, from the predominately Filipino staff. But the company has gone on a big expansion program and all the good staff have been plundered to the new branches. We have gone from great service to no service. The female manager was totally out of her depth. Did not have a clue. We made a fuss about getting seated, we had a reservation at 5pm, other people were looking to get a seat. She was the only one seating people. So she was able to take our drink order as we were seated. I ended up having to going to get the drinks. After finishing my drink 500ml beer we had been there for 25 minutes. The guy next to us , came after us, had got his order taken and had got his food. The main difference was he had to flag down a waitress. Decided that we were on a hiding to nothing and chose to pay for the drink and leave. Very sad, I have been here at least 30 times , and always rated this place A1, but the last 3 times have been a disaster.. Sad. sad. Not recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Six of us had dinner here, ordering a Brozeit platter of pork knuckle, sausages and ribs. This came with 2 side dishes (we ordered braised white German cabbage and spicy potato wedges) and a spicy chicken salad. The food was great and enough to go around. The waitress that took our drinks order slipped up in not bringing the beers ordered earlier, with the later orders getting their drinks first. This was made up by several other waiters who cheerfully helped to take group photos for us. The atmosphere was good. We were surprised that thee was a crowd on a Thursday evening. Overall, this was a positive experience
1
Brotzeit 'Raffles City' , I have eaten here on several occasions but my last experience was enough to keep me away forever. I went in for lunch just on 12.noon , no greeting from staff members and found a table without being directed to one. Only a hand full of guests at this stage, after waiting 15 minutes I had to grab the attention of a staff member.Placed an order for set lunch, soup came in 5 minutes which was good but main meal came 35 minutes later, no apology at all. Extremely bad service here, with the manger not even looking concerned, The barman took my drink order and he forgot to bring the drink as he was busy just talking opposed to looking after customers. Manager was not in control and his two staff members looked flustered, arguing with each other over meal orders. The manager here could learn a lot from their 313 Orchard Road location, the service at Somerset is excellent ,

Went over to this restaurant on a typical Sunday for lunch with my partner, I have been to this place once before and feels that the food was good and I came back for the crispy pork knuckle as it was one of their signature...on my disappointment, the item ran off, and it need an hour to wait for the next batch, but however, as I am also in a hospitality industry, it is acceptable for me as this is a high demanding item in their menu, I then approached to order other items instead.Everything was quite well until even there are some minor hiccups on services that seems to be reluctant but it is still bearable as the place seems to be short handed. Disaster struck during the billing time, as I first approached an Indian lady by flagging her with my hands as she is out at the alfresco dining area, she came by and acknowledged the request and went off but did not came by after 15 minutes, I am still patient by that and flag for another assistant and he came by with a charming smile and acknowledged, but still he did not came by again, no problem on this at all yet until the third person I flagged on, which is a lady, I am sorry I did not get hold of her and also her name BUT i definitely will recognize her if I get to see her again...seems to be either a filipino, or a myanmar nationality or either a vietnamese, to be in her middle age, holding an electronic ordering device, came by and while I said "can I have the bill please", to my wonders and to my surprise! She just walk off with a look on her face like 'huh!'ceih", I mean it is NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT at all, whether she get my question or request!? She just walk off to serve other tables and to take on other patrons orders....never even care to bother what I said...Brotzeit management, Singapore city is a place where customer service is very important as it is an island which Tourism industry plays a big part, correct me if I am wrong, it is a Hospitality industry where you need passionate people, we as the hospitality industry does not expect 100% perfect services from our staffs, as we knows that nothing is perfect or vice versa, service industry now are in need of manpower, therefore we or I know that there are much critical place to look at or to cover the crucial manpower part, but still, deliverance need to meet the basic criteria. What your staff (this typical lady) is not what a hospitality industry need, rude and shows no respect to a customer! I am writing in not to demand for anything, but I am just trying to let you know that this staff of yours, is ruining the image of our hospitality world. The standard of service in Singapore lately has been struggling, and yet, me myself as a hospitality management in my own career has personally experience the rudeness and negligence of your staff in public, against a paying customer...At least, you should acknowledge with a Yes, Sir, let me check on the bill and come back to you in a minute, our apologies to keep you waiting... What is the nuisance of just swaying off with the look of not happy
5
After coming back from the Island my partner and I did some shopping. Located on the ground floor, looking out over the river to Sentosa this place is excellent for some German food! Be prepared to queue for your table though, it's popular!
4
Located near the MRT station. Good range of beer, there are special promotions sometimes.
Perfect for a afternoon beer and some pizza.
5
A superb place to start the evening.
The food is excellent. And the beer, well, lets just say the German beer with a shot of vodka and lime go down very easily... Too easy!!
4
The German food and beer were very good and we were able to sit outdoors and watch the world go by. Very relaxing and fun to enjoy a busy part of Singapore!
5
Good and tasty breakfast options, had the crepe with fresh fruits and strawberry along with egg and bacon toast. Value for money and great service too
4
We had a business team evening at BW and the food & drinks were pre-ordered for us before we arrived. It was the only restaurant that was that busy on a Wednesday evening at VivoCity. We had a good service (probably helped that our German colleague knows the manager) and the food arrived pretty quickly. Food was good too. I don't quite remember all the names but remember the pork knuckle. It's definitely worth having.
1
Despite being at 50% capacity, it took 20 mins until I could make my order .. Staff busy talking amongst themselves most of the time rather than ensuring a great experience for customers ... Don't bother , this is the second time I have experienced this and now learnt my lesson
2
While the food is still as good as ever, it feels like there has been a change in management or some sort. It used to be that their extremely efficient electronic ordering devices combined with cheerful staff me German efficiency led to an excellent experience. Now it feels like a clown's taken over and figured out some way to gum it all up. No more cheerful staff, no water until I went and got it myself, wrong size beer, and the completely forgot the spaetzle despite the electronic ordering devices. The bad service ruined the experience
5
We had the Sharing Platter - variety of meats! Crispy roasted pig knuckles, pork chops, crispy pork belly slices, tender beef, mashed potato, braised red cabbage served with a two gravies, one of them mushroom. The crispy cracklings were delicious. Great selection of drinks, plenty of German beers of course and a good selection of cocktails.The place was buzzing and a steady flow of people queuing to be seated - ambience great with a good selection of music too.Staff were very efficient, friendly and attentive. Location is certainly attractive too as just outside a major shopping centre - definitely a place worth going too with comfortable seats as the benches are padded
4
Had try the pork knuckle last time when we were there during lunch time (2pm ish), the meat quite tough. The skin were crackling good, just the meat inside, Im not sure what went wrong, it just tough. For the price that high (SGD $) I expect perfection. Many local food offer descent meal with their individual value. My partner had chicken sausages, which was good.The beer was good, like any German beer, always good with their pork. The restaurant was in the middle of Vivo City mall, facing the ocean side.Couldn't post picture due to poor internet connection
4
Nice to have a place where hubby can relax while I went shopping! Once I joined him, though, I think he got a good deal! Apart from the inflated singapore prices on alcohol, still not too bad and a great drop! Staff very friendly, too!
5
I love this place as it sells proper German beer and traditional german food. If you want a change to your diet well worth a visit
4
Don't hesitate to come to this place if you like a good variety of great tasting German beer, tasty German food, friendly and efficient service. Yes, it costs you a few dollars more than in a hawker center but I felt good after our visit: value for money! We were there on a Friday night and it was packed. But they controlled the crowd, we didn't have to wait endlessly for food and drinks. Great experience. Multi-ethnic people, a couple of Germans around there, so it seems the restaurant must be authentic
3
I've had a lot of German food in my life (including a stint in Germany) -- and after 5 days of great Asian food wanted something a little different for lunch one day, so since I was staying near Vivo City -- decided to try this place.The inside is nice, nothing great -- but towards the rears are some nice high tops "semi outside" overlooking the bay/Sentosa island that are very nice. Started with the bread and bacon spread, which was very good. I then had the Nuremburger sausages with potato salad and sauerkraut. They were good representations of what they represented -- nothing to die for, but decent and certainly tasty enough (especially with the spicy yellow mustard, maybe Lowerbrau?). Beer selection was very good -- I tried both the Dunkle and the standard Munich pours, both very good (and authentic being they were both Paulaners from Germany). I saw a table order some meat platter with a ton of meat on it, including Swinehaxen (roasted pig's knuckle - one of my favorite dishes) and I dare say it looked very good and a lot of food, good for sharing -- so next time I may try that if I can find some more people! Tip: If you plan to stay for a while, take a table NEAR the outside -- the seats are padded and more comfortable than the high top wooden stools after an hour .
4
I have dine in this restaurant several times and now decided the write. Mix feeling with service as this is not consistent throughout.Must say that the good - sausage and pork knuckle were excellent! Got to try no regret!Special of the day made available and food is very consistent. Not the service. I will dine at this place again and be sure to gap a pint of German beer
3
Lousy service, food though yummy took ages to arrive. The manager even asked me as I was having my tea whether I would be leaving soon so he could take the table! Excuse me, I will leave when I am done! If not for the delicious huenwerst, I would not return
2
We know Germany since many years and especially the typical bavarian kitchen we are in love with. We were first really positively surprised to find such a restaurant in that area and with all positive attitudes we went in. Unfortunately all the enthusiasm was gone after we have seen the menu and especially the price list. Just one example : they promote Wiener Schnitzel (which is by the way not german at all) for 32 Dollar!!!! A standard beer is 16 Dollar!!! Sorry guys I know Singapur is expensive and you take advantage of it , but definitely not with us again. This is not worth the money.
3
We have eaten at Brotzeit a few times and have to say that the quality of the dishes at Raffles are far superior to the ones at VivoCity. The atmosphere at both are equally as good.The last time I dined at Vivo I had the Seafood Salad and was a little disappointed in the fact that my salad only had 2 thin pieces of seared tuna 1 piece of smoked salmon 2 olives and 1 prawn. The lettuce was dripping wet and sitting in .5cm of water. I had paid mainly for a bowl of lettuce. The one I recently had at Raffles City was much better, It had 4 lovely thick slices of Tuna, more Smoked Salmon, 2 lovely plump prawns and a good scattering of olives. a really enjoyable salad. Love the atmosphere at Brotzeit and the Beer is pretty good also
4
Conveniently located near our hotel we stopped in here for a snack and a beer. Everything was really great but we were slow to be served and had to get the attention of the staff to get our bill. This seemed a little out of character with the rest of our Singapore experience. But being German beer lovers it's hard to complain when you can get Paulaner "Frisch von Fass" in Asia
4
Very good food and excellent value for money. Had an office event there and our German counterpart ordered for the table. Service was prompt and helpful. This restaurant was the only one which was full although there were many more in the area surrounding it.It has a very good selection of german beers and wine. The pork knuckle was the highlight of the dishes we had on our table. I will definitely recommend it. The Brotzeit Platter is enough to share between 2-4 people depending on how hungry you are
4
Had a family dinner here. Great environment. Service is okay - cam improve.
Food is good. We ordered an apetitizer to share, soup, two salads and pork knuckle. The five of us were full.
5
Had the platter just the other day.
It was very good, huge portion! Just for $88. Actually it's enough for 5 people. 4 of us couldnt finish the whole plate. Generous portion.
4
Excellent authentic german food in the heard of vivocity overlooking sentosa.
The complete paulaner range on tap, a variety of generously proportioned tasting plates, entrees and mains are on the menu as well
5
Went with 2 other friends to celebrate Boxing Day and it was one of the most memorable experience.The food was delicious; especially their Breaded Camembert with Cranberry Sauce, Sausage Platter, and Pork Knuckle. Each serving was huge and it took the 3 of us to finish them up. The drinks were refreshing with beer mixes; we had Affensaft and Bayrischer Longdrink
4
The restaurant is on the ground floor of Vivocity. Food is very good. My pork steak is very tender. The place was packed at weekend with families. Decor is tasteful and modern but most seats are benches and air conditioners are blowing cold air on your head so choose wisely where to sit.There are outside sitting as well and it is overlooking the sea
5
One sentence :If you think like you feel homesick with Deustchland then you're home baby!! Beers, food, appetizer, salads even snacks are really served with the hometown taste and flavours. Oh please do pick a bar side or just hittin up the sidewalk while waiting for food to come you can enjoy the Sentosa view
4
I have visited this outlet and more often the one in 313@Somerset, I have yet to have a bad experience the food is always good and the service prompt and friendly. They seem to be expanding into other South East Asian Countries and rightly so.The only thing I always suffer from is i always order too much, the portions certainly in Singapore are on the large side so be careful when ordering
5
Authentic and very good German food, especially the sausages and the grilled dishes with potatos of various preparations, and complete with German and other brands of beer in a tall glass!! Excellent and smiling service and helpful staff. Location?... superb, with the tall glass frontage overlooking the bay with Sentosa right across. It is an extraordinarily likeable place for a Sunday brunch after a hectic shopping in the Giants supermarket in the basement or for that matter any shopping in the cavernous interiors of the Vivocity Mall. My wife and me, during our years in the city, hv been to other brotzeit restaurants also there especially the one on Clark Quay, but the Vivocity one has always been the favourite. Even now, whenever we go to Singapore, a visit to Brotzeit Vivocity is a must
5
I have been to Brotzeit at least 30 times over the last 5 years.Their food and service, as well as value for money has always impressed me.In fact so much that I looked at the cost and availability of getting the franchise for New Zealand.Whew! it is not cheap, outside of my budget.If you like German food , German beer and good service this is the place.Make sure you book if you are going on Friday, Saturday or Sunday night.And if you cannot handle Snapps don't talk to the Manager because he will offer to have a free one with you
5
A German friend invited us for a dinner at brotzeit, a German Bar and Restaurant located at Vivo City. It's my first time to dine at a German Resto and I am somewhat curious about the foods. We ordered a big platter of assorted sausages, pork knuckle and beers. The place is full of diners inside and outside wherein you could view the harbor and Sentosa Island. The foods are great and of course there are different types of beers to choose from. Like what they said, "where the best sausage platter in Singapore are served". 
5
Absolutely amazing restaurant!!! went with family and friends and evrybody enjoyed the whole experience.. the food and the ambiance and their quality of service, everything was really really good! would definitely recommend this place for a nice weekend dinner.
4
This was a great sidewalk restaurant. We arrived late and ordered some sandwiches - presentation was fun and the quality better. Friendly staff. It was the perfect spot sit outside and people watch.
5
Found this restaurant on Orchard Road the last time we were in Singapore and made sure we returned this time. They do have other restaurants around Singapore as well. The food is amazing and definitely worth a visit. The restaurant has a great ambience and the prices are quite reasonable. Staff are incredibly polite and professional which make it an overall great experience. Definitely worth a visit, even if for only a great German beer!!
2
Went there 2 days back for lunch at the Vivo City outlet, to seek refuge from the Haze. The place was relatively empty or a comfortable crowd which should allow waiters to be able to perform their jobs up to expectation. To cut a long story short, service was not too good, but I could see that she was quite new to the job, so I let it be.But what I found disappointing was the portion of the food and the quality. I initially ordered the steak, she did not ask how I would like it done and proceeded to relay the order to the kitchen. Only after about 10 minutes, did we received the message that our order could not be done because the sauce had 'finished'! In my mind, I was thinking that they are a reputable restaurant and they cannot make the sauce? Is it because they pre-make it or will making a new batch take too long? In the end I opted for the meat patty, which was tough, slightly brunt on the outside and accompanied by a salty sauce with lack of flavour. Thankfully the 2 patties were small so I did not have to endure too much. This is not my first time there, and I do know they do a mean pork knuckle but just because it is a lunch set, doesn't mean that the standard of the food should drop
3
After spending the day at Sentos, we decided to eat at this German restaurant at the mall where the monorail lets you off. We elected to sit outside & the view across the water to Sentosa was great! The "grown up radler" drink I had (consisting of beer, vodka & lime juice was perfect after a long hot day. I had a pork chop with veggies & potatoes that was good, not great, not bad, just good. My husband had weinerschnitzle with potatoes that was just ok. The service was ok. Everything there was "OK". Granted, you dont go to Singapore to eat German food, but, for a place that is world reknown for its food, you would think it would have been better than just OK
4
It is a very nice place for group gathering, esp. when most in the group enjoy a nice cold beer. There are a few variety of draught beer to choose from, and non will disappoint you. The food menu consist of a wide variety of platters and sides to choose for the gathering. Staff and great and they anticipate your needs promptly even when the place is pack with diners...Very good place to people watch as well. Worth visiting again and again for gatherings and dates
4
I have organized dinner at Brozeit Bier Bar @ Vivocity branch on 30th April 2013.We have a special package (buffet) for big group due to budget constraints.We have more than 30 people.Price was affordable. Colleagues were pleased with the beer esp Paulaner MÃ¼nchner Lager 50 Litres $ 950++Pork knuckles were awesome (we have at least 8 rounds). MUST TRY!Staff were very focus and attentive although it was a holiday eve on that day
3
We had tried to eat here previously, only to find that by 6pm there is a queue and a long waiting time.So, we eventually came with friends and booked a table. No doubt because they are busy, we were told that if we were more than 15 minutes late our table would be released.I have colleagues who will always eat at Brotzeit, so I was interested to find out why. Actually, it was a little disappointing. The menu is heavily biased towards pork (and one of our party was Muslim) and there was little for the health conscious, likes salads (one of our party was watching what they ate). Having had the white sausages, I wonder what all the fuss is over. The hole dish was rather bland and there was nothing remarkable about it or anything that our party had.If you're German / Swiss and missing home, then I'm sure this is the place for you. Sadly, it wasn't for us.Overall the noise level of the restaurant meant that any conversation was very limited and the service was just a little slow because of the sheer number of people
4
From my birthday celebrations to many small unplanned visits to this place..I have enjoyed it all times...we prefer to sit outside and like the pizzas served..beer is good..coke n mango mixed beer is a bit unique and out of the way but we enjoy these too.Good place to relax n chit chat with frens
4
Undoubtedly the best sausage platter available in Singapore - easily be shared between two. Also try their pork knuckle and variety of salads. The beer is fresh and has lost of variety. Be prepared to queue up during peak hours (about 20 mins wait should get you a table) - speaks volumes of their quality..Outdoor is a slightly warm - but offers the best view of the Sentosa harbour any time of the day. The waiters are polite but very knowledgeable - ask for specialized help if you need to drill down to a flavour of a specific beer
3
Gives you a taste of german flavour.
Large food portions. Thus, order conservatively.
Budget $20 per pax for a very full stomach.
Try out the beverages. Not something you'll get at any restaurant.
4
A very conveniently located place for lunch or dinner with beer. The schnitzels (veal, pork, and even chicken, no less) are enormous, and the goulash and Spätzle are excellent. Welcoming, friendly, and good service.
4
i went for lunch with 5 girls for a friend's farewell. the restaurant's sitting arrangement enabled us to chat with one another easily. the food was great. we had salad, pork knuckle, sausage and beer.
5
I went for a meal with my father and was recommended this restaurant because of its good atmosphere and great Bavarian dishes. We arrived around 8pm and there was a queue of around 4-5 tables waiting outside. This is understandable for dinner time in a very busy shopping mall. We were seated at the bar and quickly had our drinks order taken along with a couple of pretzels as a little something before our main food.We both went for sausage dishes, one spicy chicken and one pork and cheese. Portions were good and food came within about 5 mins of ordering it which was very impressive considering the restaurant was at full capacity!! Air con is OK but nothing outstanding. Sitting outside was an option but in a tropical climate was something we were interested in.Overall very impressed!
3
Nice ambience, though it didn't have air conditioning. Very strange for a restaurant here, with just fans. If you're the type that perspires crazily like me, then you might want to think twice.Food was generally good, with goodly sized portions. We had the platter, and the knuckles were good, with skin that was crispy. The sides that came with it were very small, considering that the platter was supposed to be for 4-5 people. Also had the sausage platter, and this was only average. Would have been better if they had traditional German sausages like bock wurst instead of what seemed to me to be Italian-style sausages. Pizzas were nice, cut into squares. We ordered 3 types, all were nice but I only recall the spinach one.The other thing that puts you off is the atrocious service. Requests to fill up water glasses had to be repeated a few times. Trying to get eye contact for service was equally hard. I really don't understand how so many staff can deliver such bad service, when in Australia, you would get far better service with half the number of wait staff
5
My friends and I visits Brozeit every other month just for chilling out and meeting up sessions.The weekends are busy and it's always good to book in advance for your spot. The price is good for the beer but the food is a little on the steep side. I like their salads which are really good.I would say good for casual friends gatherings and couples who just want to grab a drink on a friday night after work.. Not exactly the place for first dates.. :
1
The service was very bad . Had to call the staff many times and there was no respone . Even when the staff finally came , the waiter gave a very unhappy face and just walk off . The food was too sour . The chicken breast was one of the worst I have eaten . Overall this place is bad . Over price no value for money .
5
Well i worked quite close to this place. I almost always ended here after work. I did not want to be disturbed.I just sat on the bar and had some really nice chilled beer. The service was always fantastic.. The beers are fresh and well served.. I recommend this place
1
A glasss of beer is $20. This is a riff off. Day light robbery. Go to coffeeshop and have a glass of beer for $2.90. almost 8 X higher. The food no need to talk about also expensive. 4th floor food ripublic, can have 1 meal for less tan $5. This is a expensive place to avoid

The food is very good. Its unfortunate that we don't eat pork, as this is what their specialised with. But the non pork meal are also good. My mom loves the mash potato, its very tasty and creamy. I love the ice coffee. love love itâ€¦ its very goo
4
This place sits right beside the sea and so the atmosphere is pretty good. Lotsa of people during the weekends. I love the sausages they serve here. But think the price is slightly on the high side, but nice service and environment.
4
Went for a quick lunch. Set menu just under S$ 20 but with tax and service, added soft drink the total is more like S$ 27.Very nice pumpkin soup as well as Schnitzel. Money well spent, sadly the 20 $ mark means it is more like a one off treat
5
I used to be a regular at other restaurants that attempt to offer German food but ever since Brotzeit opened its doors, I simply have no other choice but to come here. The food simply tastes like home starting with my favorite, which is the boiled beef, to the Kasespaetzle and the sausage platter. Whenever I have guests, I bring them to Brotzeit and we typically order the pork knuckle as it's too big to be eaten by one.What I also like is the fact that Brotzeit offers seasonal specialities like the white asparagus, which they have in tandem with the season in Germany (May/June). They also have seasonal beers like Maibock and Oktoberfest beer to complete the annual cycle.Expect to find me there regularly, preferably on Fridays for a long beer lunch ;-

Dined in Brotzeit for a several times, several branches. I am pretty sure i deserve to write a review about its popularity and its courses with my experiences. Ambience of the restaurant is nice, seatings are well organized with its lovely surroundings. Wouldn't say it is a quiet place to dine, but not as loud as a market place. Wouldn't be right if a place that serves beer turns out to be quiet. Environment is just enough for a relaxing dinner.Had always been a regular at "happy hour" loves the German beer offered by Brotzeit. Always had the Brotzeit platter for a couple of times and never seem to disappoint me. Its schnitzels & sausages always taste amazing.. However, try avoiding the knuckles as it is rock hard and overcooked leaving it dry as well. Not so good with the knuckles as they promoted it. On the bright side, some may love it maybe its not up to my taste of it. Getting a platter should costs you reasonably $90 up to 4 or 5 person depending on how much of a big eat you are. Adding on your sides, the breaded camembert is just amazing and highly recommended!! Try it out and you will know what I am talking about. Pizzas are also a way to go, not too bad and recommended to have it shared. Always start and end your meal with a pint of beer. Definitely taste better, at least for me. The original lagger had always been my favorite or maybe you can catch the Winterbier during the winter season to go with. Will definitely return again but will avoid the knuckles unless its further improved
1
Ok, I don't usually get angry with restaurant experiences but this I gotta share. I had heard about the popularity of this chain before and came here to meet a friend. First off, lines....seems like its unavoidable anywhere in this city. The waiters and staff weren't very friendly and it took a long time before somebody came to get our orders. My friend told me the chain was famous for its pork knuckles so we ordered one.I gotta say, this is the absolute worst crap pork knuckles I've ever had. It looks like something out of a nuclear reactor with its puffy browned out crust which, by the way, unless you have canine teeth, is hard as rock and impossible to chew. The meat itself was dry, stringy and hurt going down your throat. The rest of the salad and desert was just bland generic stuff not worth even writing about.Bottomline is, probably one of the single worst dining experiences ever. For those craving pork knuckles, word of advice, go elsewhere. There is some nice place in Joo Chiat that I went to later which was absolutely delicious. Otherwise, avoid this place like a plague
2
Made a reservation and were seated at 7:30pm on Christmas. While we were waiting like fools for the rest of our family members to arrive, they treated us as fools. None of the staffs had the decency to alert waiting customers on the status of their all time favorite pork knuckles. Their informing system does not go by the standard first come first serve basis at all. 10 mins after everyone has arrived, they decided to take the initiative to proudly tell us the pork knuckles had just sold out. Time was 8pm. I am not sure what to make out of this. Poor stock management for the occasion? Or have we been neglected and discriminated for 30mins? On a positive note, water was automatically served. On the flipped side, not even beer was offered. It was automatically assume and decided water was for our best interest. Perhaps this place is too fancy for a family of 6 ordinary folks
3
The ambiance is nice. Located in an alley behind a mall with an awning and a giant fan above. The beer is good as are some of the beer cocktails if you can call them that, Shandy etc. The food is mainly sausages of different kinds served with sauerkraut and potato salad. What was more interesting was the dinner specials, different for each day of the week. Mondays and Tuesdays more so, serving Honey Bavarian Pork Ribs and Roast Duck. Desserts however weren't too interesting
5
And the beer is anyway. Always liked to drink Paulaner here. They also have illy coffee. This restaurant is usually busy as Brotzeit is a popular restaurant in Singapore and they have many restaurants throughout the city. They have proper (and popular) outdoor seating for smokers @ vivocity. I can recommend the "pizza", the chanterelle mushrooms (seasonal) and the mozzarella salad. The price value atmosphere is quite good here so we had several meals here throughout our 5 day stay. Service is friendly and professional
4
Went to the 313 Somerset outlet for lunch. Not too much of a crowd, so we got to choose our seats. We ordered a pork knuckle and some pork sausages and beer (Winterbier).The pork knuckle (Schweinshaxn) was quite generous, so maybe 2 person can share it. Sausages (Nurnberger) was also done in an excellent manner.What we dint like was the saurkraut, and thats because sadly, we dint know how to really appreciate this German dish.Location wise, the somerset outlet has no aircon, but there are giant fans overhead
4
Visited Brotzeit @ Vivo in Dec 2012. Fantastic food esp the tasty pork knuckle. The serving portion is big ! The sausages are quite salty to me. I would recommend just order the pork knuckles at SGD30+ and some side dishes like potato wedges, napkin dumplings. Ignore the set that cost SGD88 as the "chicken fillet" taste average and the sausages that are too salty. The original Paulaner beer is a must-order ! Smooth for a person who doesn't really like regular beer like Carlsberg and Tiger.Overall a good experience and will definitely come again for special occasion
5
The Pork Knuckle is a must try and i would recommended the dark lager. Place is at a premium, so you have to be prepared to wait to be seated. But the wait is worth it.
5
Good Value for money. We love it as a family restaurant. Good selection of beers and wine. The grilled salmon is lovely.
4
One of my regular spots in Singapore. Good German food and beer. They have some menu changes through the season that keep you coming back.
5
There is not much to add to the headline. This German restaurant serves authentic food, mainly from the southern part of Germany. It has a good selection of draft and bottled beers, very friendly and quick service, and the portions are big enough. It isn't cheap, but the prices are fair for what you get. I will come back here again.
4
The food is superb, the staff is very attentive and your never left wanting for good, cold beer in your hand. The menu selection leaves you making some hard choices since they all sound so good. I had the Boar and Venison Ragot and just loved it.The only down side to sitting near the sidewalk was the two panhandlers that came by but the staff shooed them away immediately. Get there early for a few drinks and then order dinner or make reservations because they fill up fast at dinner time
4
One of the best European restaurants in Singapore serving authentic German dishes as the name suggests. The atmosphere is good as well as the sea view, if one desires it for a relaxed meal. Service is efficient. Staff will assist in selecting a suitable dish by answering questions about the menu
4
We found this place by accident on our way back to the Intercontinental. It's on the outside of a shopping mall with an open front, so you are practically sitting outside. I saw that they offered Paulaner Dunkel Hefe Weissbier, I was hooked. My wife ordered a Muenchner Dunkel Lager, you get the picture, we love dark beer. For food we shared a Press Sack, which is pork in aspic and for the main course we chose the Kartoffel ( potato ) Goulasch and the Schnitzel. Being from Europe I found the dishes close to the original in taste, which surprised me. Also, later I found out this is a chain restaurant with locations all over Asia. Who would have known that German food was franchiseable? The prices are very reasonable, the atmosphere was good, the service was acceptable, no German girls serving, though. There are many many more tempting dishes on the menu well worth a try. When in Singapore we will definitely be back and will also look for them at other destinations in Asia
1
There are lots of other food options in Vivocity so skip this place.They accept reservations but everyone in your party has to turn up within 10mins if not they will remove the table. I understand the policy as it deters people from hogging the table but there should be some flexibility as we are a group of 16 and it is difficult for everyone to arrive at the same time due to work commitments. Moreover, it is on a weekday and the place was half empty! So why the urgency to release our table?The waiters will keep coming to bug you to order more food and drinks even when you have not finished your drink or food. It seems they are either concerned about pressuring you to finish up quickly and leave on time or they are really concerned about the company's profit margins.Each of us had ordered 2 rounds of beer and lots of food and they couldn't leave us in peace to chat! Terrible terrible.Each of us paid around $80 but we are not satisfied with the service at all. The food is quite good, but the prices are expensive
2
It is pricey - a meal for 2 here can easily come to SGD 200 including drinks, which is poor performance given the average quality. Despite this, it is popular and can get very crowded. Having already spent a tidy sum, I asked for tap water to refill my daughter's glass but was told it had to be mineral water. I think this sums up their poor attitude to providing value to customers. You could do much better in Singapore
5
I would highly recommend this restaurant Brotzeit, it's a German restaurant and bar and there are a few outlets here in S'pore, conveniently located. The food is great, and the beer is good if you are a beer drinker. Overall, I enjoyed the food. Go early or make reservations for a group, early as it's really popular and there's a long queue especially on fridays, and the weekends for dinner
5
We are regular customers in all their branches and it simply stunning how they manage to keep the quality and taste of the food at such high and consistent levels. Ok, prices are not cheap, but you get what you pay for, simple and clear.
5
Food was good with reasonable price if you liker German food. Quite authentic also. The one at Vivo City has the best ambiance as it is overlooking to the sea and you can choose to have outdoor seat if you like sunshine.
5
A very high standard of classic German cooking, speedy and attentive service and a good location, all at reasonable prices. The Paulaner beer is well worth it on its own.
4
Well.. you will find this place relaxing.. A place to chill out and have a pint of beer or two.. with some finger foods to nimble.. And also, perhaps, cappuccino?
5
The sausages were brilliant, the beers were excellent, service was great and the setting was amazing. Need I say more?
5
Have been there several times. Food excellant. Late afternoon/early evening view/atmosphere great. Staff good.
5
Went to Brotzeit this week, wasn't intending to eat but started getting hungry so ordered up some sausage, some salad and some sort of potato dish. All the food was superb, well presented and the service was super friendly.
4
Overall, the food is nice, but kinda pricey if ordered ala carte. If any travelers happen to be in a group of 4 to 5, then the 88S$ pork knuckle platter is highly recommended. The knuckle is equally roasted, the skin is crispy, the sauce is super. There can be a variety of side dishes to choose from such as potato salad, mashed potato, roasted potato, braised vegetables. The german wurst that comes with it are just pure gourmet. Not only they are nice, in fact, it makes one think that they are eating sausages in Germany. Do not forget about the beer, especially the weiss bier, the taste is refreshing almost on par with hoegarden. That's all
3
My husband and I ate here in August last year as the place seemed to be incredibly well patronised and we thought we'd have a change. The place was packed but we got a table without much trouble. The clientele seems to encompass many young expat business people (particularly male) and you understand why as the beer is free flowing and the meal serving are huge. It was actually the size of the servings that put me off as I can't stand plates piled up to their limit and just the nature of German food doesn't lend itself to attractive presentation. That said, my husband had the pork knuckle and loved it and I had sausages & sauerkraut which I hardly made a dent in. Passing Brotzeit several evenings this year nothing has changed, it's still packed and still attracting the young and hungry. It's seems to be a good place to go in a group and wind down after a week at the office or for tourists wanting something that will really fill them up
5
I live in Zurich and was hanging out for something European to make a change. Some friends took me to Brotzeit at VivoCity and I really love this place. A good selection of European beers, good hearty Bavarian fare and great service. I still find it a pleasure to get friendly table service even in a bar :
4
Long Q and crowded did not deter us. We waited and managed to get seating
Orders was done just nice and portions are more than sufficient for all.
Wines are served nicely
Friend and attentive staffs.
Thumb up
3
They have very good offers during lunch hours but are a bit overpriced for dinner. Very nice and relaxing atmosphere at Vivocity, overlooking the water and RWS.
5
Very good German food! Paulaner restaurant taste like SHOOT compare this one. The only thing that you need to worry about is that you have to wait for a table.
2
Pros
(1) Tasty beer
Cons
(1) Not that much choice for beer
(2) Food is poor.
5
Lovely food and great beer! Nice atmosphere. Absolutely worth a visit.
5
Their Sunday brunch are the best in town. The layout is as extensive as it can get. That topped with free flow of the best German beer in Singapore makes it wonderful. Ask for warm freshly prepared Pretzels and you will love them.
4
The schweinehaxe was delicious. I like the ambiance, the staff is nice, the menu has something for everyone and the prices are fair.
5
If you want to drink German beer and eat Bratwurst this a great place to go. Pretty relaxed feel and there are other things on the menu if you don't like the above. Anything with spinach is especially good.
5
This resturant is aptly located facing the sea towards sentosa. You get nice view while enjoying your food. Sometimes it can get fully occupied and you would need to wait (actually that shows how much people enjoy the place here). German beer at the best is available here. The food is awesome. Being with friends, enjoyed the Schnitzel, Sausages, Pork Knuckle, Pommes fries, German Breads. Being myself in few years in Germany, the beer and food reminded back the good old nostalgic days
5
That's what my Australian husband loves there. I like very much the plate of good bread with cheese, ham, pickles and their pizza...They have different sausages, reasonable cabbage, good choice of beverages, inluding, naturally, several types of beer. It's on the corner over the street from the Raffles Hotel. On Friday evening, it's better to make reservation
4
great place to hang out with friend before next stop
1
Poor quality german food. Even Sauerkraut was too plain. Tasteless! They add service charge into my bill but service was poor.
4
Sausages, mash, sauerkraut and beer. Great concept! The menu options are a little limited but the food, service and beer were all great!
5
love this place. Great value for money, fresh ingredients, perfectly prepared. I find the one at 313 Sommerset the weakest in terms of food; Vivo is best and Raffles City a close second. Love love love their wiener schnitzel.
3
This is a chain that serves German cuisine. The sausages are OK but not authentic. There is always something tasty on the menu. The draft German beer is the real thing.
5
Friendly staff, good beer and some really good snacks to go with it. What more can you ask? Try the sausages!
3
Ive been here before and the food is pretty good. The staff is sometimes slow due to understaffing. They handed a menu that had food not available. I was a little disapointed to find out that i can only have a jagerschnitzel on sundays. The price was 88$S for 2 people. Beer is goo
4
Went here with a business colleague who lives in Singapore but is German. We had a sausage sampler plate along with the Monday night special which was pork ribs. Sausage was very good as was the sauerkraut although not the same as you'd get in Munich. The pork ribs were good and had a very different type of sauce - almost sweet. Very hard to describe but very delicious. Beer was good - a requirement for a good German restaurant. A nice take if you want something different from Asian food while in Singapore
2
It's past 10pm. We should have a good time. Unfortunately kitchen is closing and staff in a hurry. Didn't get to order my favorite dish. We made do with a few drinks and called it a night. Hope I have a better visit next time. My take is that it is probably better to go on a weekend night.
3
Went with a colleague to Brotzeit @ Vivo city in Singapore. . Being very partial to Duck, I was absolutely delighted that their Tuesday Special was Duck with Red Cabbage and Mash.The ambiance was really nice. Although it was crowded, my colleague could have a decent conversation at normal vocal tones. Our orders were taken very quickly and the duck that I ordered was served all withing 25 mins of us being seated.Presentation on the plate was nice but when I started eating, I found that the duck was really not what I expected. The meat was really tough and I had difficulty using my knife and fork to cut up the meat.Sawing that, the meat was tasty although the toughness presented it's own challenges.My colleague has the sausages and it really look nice. According to him, it was great. Then again, everything taste great when it is drowned in tomato catchup.Would I go back there again? Most certainly, even if only to try the platter which the table next to ours ordered. Looks really good........
5
Trully wonderful pork knuckle,great staff,lovely beer-Thx to Raphael Adolph! Go ther you will not be disappointed.City Hall MRT is the stop
4
Unfortunately the only beer they serve is Paulaner. Was expecting a range, but there wasn't. Pork Knuckle was huge and very tasty
4
My husband and I tried Brotzeit after some friends who had visited Singapore had recommended shopping at Vivo City. We were shown to an inside / outside table by a very nice young lady, ordered some delicious German white wine and a sausage dish. We have been to Germany many times and this was pretty authentic taste-wise. A very pleasant way to spend an afternoon
3
Hubby loved this place, the beer was good and he would have stayed for another litre or two.The menu was not too exciting, but then it is stuck on the side of a shopping mall and does not really have the ambience of a proper Bier Kellar.I did have a marvellous chocolate pudding with vanilla ice cream accompanied by a nice cup of good quality coffee
4
It was around 100 meters away from my Hotel . One early afternoon we stepped into it and had a highly enjoyable fill . They have three options of fill , 300 ml , 500 ml and 100 ml . And plenty of German beers to choose from . We opted for a table just beside the pavement and watched idle world pass by . Good food , better beers and lovely ambiance. There was a sharp shower in between which prolonged our stay ( and fills too ) . Regret not making it in the evening , watched a couple of times while walking by. Long waiting list unfortunately ....
4
This place is definitely a must in Singapore to experience high quality German/Austrian food. All the classics are served and the portions are really generous. The only downside is the service which sometimes isn't very friendly.But well, judging from what I had in my plate, I was more than happy and returned three times already
3
Visited with friends on an early Saturday evening food was well cooked and arrived warm, atmosphere within the area was good and the beer was served correctly. Attentive staff who looked after us well but just not enough selection to make me want to visit agai
4
Good location in Orchard road are just above Somerset MRT. It is always busy on weekend evenings( some have to wait for tables ) but not during happy hour afternoon. Food served are mainly German dishes. The best ones are the sausages ( there are a few choices ) served with sauerkraut and french fries. I personally like the garlic sausages.-around $15 perplate. I was not happy with my Hungarian Goulash meatt- although some friends do- my meat was half grizzle and the Goulash is not that tasty. ( $26 ), a friend had a dry snitzel. Lots of beer choices and wine. They serve pizza as well but did not try. Had an interesting desert- like a fry cut donut. Dinner for three was $ 170
5
Well-managed restaurant with very good food, friendly service and really nice ambience. Our party of 6 shared the Large Platter : Pork Knuckle, Assorted Sausages and Schnitzel (Pork, not Veal) with sides of Sauerkraut and German Bead. Added Seafood and one other Salad to make a satisfying lunch. For desserts, we enjoyed the delightful Apple Strudel. Good Paulaner Beers on tap. Prices are reasonable, given the overall excellence of this restaurant and its prime location in VivoCity
3
If you're looking for a quick casual meal and a cold beer this is a great place to stop. You probably would not go out of your way to get there but if hungry this is a bettr place to stop than the other places around it. The pretzels are excellent (but dangerous for a low card diet
4
Brotzeit serves one of Singapore's best pork knuckle.
4
Pork knuckle... you need to have one...
end of review!!
4
Simple, just love it, great service good German meal
4
Vibrant and good service at the bar in Vivocity. It gives positive energy throughout!
3
Good pork knuckle and salad fix for when I need a meat fix
5
We have visited all the Brotzeits restaurants in Singapore as we live here and highly recommend everyone.The food, drinks and service are always consistently good and I like you fact you can change your sides on any meal, my favorite is the boiled beef.It gets very busy so it might be worth booking unless you are eating pretty early

Brotzeits German Restaurant and Bar at "RAFFLES City"252 North Bridge Roadhttp://brotzeit.co/rafflescity/Please note: CLARIFICATION on LOCATION:- I am actually talking about the bar at the Raffles Location, and NOT at VivoCity! I have NOT been able to locate the Raffles one on TripAdvisor for review.- Brotzeit at "Raffles City" is a charming, very popular German style bar, great for lunch, happy hour and dinner, located in an upscale district near by the City Hall MRT Station. It offers tasty, "traditional" German cuisine and beers, among others.Its menus are in both German and English. The lunch menu has a large selection and is very reasonable for ca. 15 SD each. Its most popular dish is perhaps the delicious pork knuckle (32SD for dinner), large enough for 2 people! It offers a variety of wonderful German draft beers, of course! My wife and I met up with two friends there for happy hour and dinner, and we all enjoyed our dinners and drinks, as well as its cheerful bar ambience, of course! Â The service was excellent. The servers all speak excellent English (not German, however). Its cuisine and beers (not to mention its menu in German) reminded us of our good times in Germany, although, strangely, we had never found Roasted/Fried Pork Knuckle dish in Germany over the years, where we only had the traditional boiled type. [By the way, we did find some German restaurants/bars in Bangkok and Hong Kong also serve roasted/fried pork knockle.].Peterskis, Feb, 201
4
My first trip to Brotzeit last week would be only the first of many if I come to Singapore again. My best friend, Laurentia Fany is a German food lover and she recommended it, so I knew it was going to be good. Amazing food, huge portions, great service and nice atmosphere you will find in this restaurant.The Backhendlsalat / Crispy Chicken Salad and Pork Knuckle were huge hits at my table, as was the Apfelschorle. I had enjoyed German food at some restaurants in Bali, but nothing could compare to Brotzeit. This an excellent restaurant. The service is great and the food fantastic. Do yourself a favor and experience it for yourself
4
My boyfriend absolutely loves the beer here! mainly because the Aussie in him can't get enough of beer off the tap! Haha. I'm not a beer fan, but I must say, it's pretty good. For the ladies, if you want to skip the beer and try something else, I'll recommend trying the Spezi. Its a german soda with a tinge of orange. YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST SQUUEZE THE SLICE OF ORANGE INTO YOUR DRINK!It really taste VERY different. Try going to Brotzeit at 313, for a different expeirence. People-watching's good whilst drinking (:
2
Used to patron for their pork knuckles but the quality and the taste of the food is no longer as nice as before. The service is slow as well and waitress are not energetic at all. If you want to chill out and food quality is not an issue, here's probably a good place with good selection of beers.
4
The Pork Knuckle is fantastic - crispy and filling. Their sauceage platter is also another must-try. All goes well with beer.
5
First we tried a "small"lunch (Nürnberger Rostbratwurst),because we didn#texpect something authentic.But it was great,like a lunch in Bavaria.Then we had "Wiener schnitzel"and the "Haxe"Heavy load,but wonderful.The beers were very tasteful and original german.Great experience in far east.A must-go.
5
Better German food than you would get in Germany! Curry wurst, schnitzel and all the other sausage dishes highly recommended
5
Great food and plenty of it, quick service. We only ordered for three of the four people and still had plenty.
5
We have been a couple of times with friends, colleagues, clients, and as a family. We always enjoyed the atmosphere, however the food could improve. To bad they do not have non alcoholic beer, such as Erdinger Weizen Alkohlfrei
3
If you like German Beers, this is one of the place to go.
Most of the time it is very crowded, so if you don't like crowds, stay clear. ;p
4
We have visited Brotzeit many times in the locations Vivo City (waterfront, nice view and some air), Raffles City (if you like watching the traffic) and 313 Sommerset (good alternative sitting outside). The service is, mane perceived, best at Vivo, attentive, pro-active and fast. Food is good, some items better than others, recommend the Gulasch, Schnitzel and the Currywurst. The Pork knuckle is maximum average and was not great at all today, maybe the pig had a bad last day. Drinks, what else, are a good selection of beers from Bavaria and some of them can't be found in other places (Hacker Pschorr Kellerbier, my favorite). Casual dining with some quote authentic German food
4
i know the highlights of the restaurant should be the pork knuckles, german beer etc etc. those taste fab too, but i just gotta rave about the potato wedges that are most often forgotten about. they are the best that i have ever had! and at a pretty low price for a pretty large quantity. must try
4
I had a post christmas celebration dinner at the Raffles City branch and ordered the platter which comes with pork knuckles, variety of sausages, pork schnitzels with 2 side dishes. There's a variety of side dishes to choose from but my friends and i ordered the roasted potatoes and sauerkraut which was pretty tasty. The platter cost S$88 and is good to share for 4-5pax. I am glad that the food did not dissappoint. For german food, i personally think my best experience is still at the Hofbrauhaus when i was in Munich. As the place is quite popular, it is best to make a reservation in order to get a table. Nice place to dine if you are craving for german food
5
Well, being german I had to kill some homesickness. Very good german beer and the alcohol-free version especially for me. Food is very good. Just what you can expect about german/bavarian food. Typical sausages, sauerkraut, etc.Nice interior and furniture. Bit of a beergarden atmosphere: sit next to strangers and maybe even start talking to them. Love the location. You can sit in- or outside and watch people passing by - business people, shopping addicts, tourists
4
Food is good esp the wurst and beer!! of course.
But skip the White Asparagus Soup - its like hot milky water
4
Carnivorous? Then enjoy! Chunky portions to be washed down by a good selection of german beers! Simple formula, good execution! Bottomline: Good food, good beer!
4
Good beer. I had a fifth of very yummy meat until my friend told me it was pork knuckle. Am not supposed o eat pork, but it was very very good!
Good beer,had the pale one. Service is so so as anywhere in singapore
4
When we are in Singapore, we frequently go to their 3 outlets (at vivo city, city hall, 313).
We like very much the Weiss beer and the food.For dinner on Friday's/Saturday's a reservation is a must if one does not like to queue up.
4
The vivocity branch has very good views. We went on a Friday night and even caught the fireworks from resorts world sentosa. All our dishes came quickly and taste great as well. Huge serving as well. Recommend the pork knuckle, sausage platter for sharing and salad. We queued for about an hour for a table on Friday evening. Understand from the waitress that they accept reservation but you have to book at least 3-4 days in advance
4
Have been to both Raffles City and Vivo City outlets. The food is definitely better than at Paulaner's ; ..finally a good selection of real Bavarian beers in Singapore ... Service at Raffles is only as good as you organise things yourself . Service at Vivo City ..very good.Well done Brotzeit ...be back soon agai
4
Brotzeit offers a "German" experience, with German beer on tap, and a menu with tasty German favorites.The signature dish is the ample pork knuckle.0.5 litre draft German beer costs SGD 13.We had a fun afternoon here, soaking up the atmosphere in this busy establishment, which offers both inside and outside seating.The food is very tasty, and authentically German. I thought the pricing was reasonable for the quality offered, the size of the servings and the premium location.The service is friendly, with prompt food service, even when they were very busy.Brotzeit is located near to the Fairmont and Swisotel Stamford, as well as the Raffles Place shopping center.It's a great place to go with friends to spend a fun afternoon
4
Germans are known for their beers and this place doesn't disappoint. Their choice of beers is extensive. The view is beautiful and you should pereferably sit outside after sundown. The only issue is that the alfesco space tends to get very noisy beacuse of the Indian restaurant that shares the space right beside and it tends to get a little smoky sometimes because of the sheer number of people lighting up! Although this is more of a place to just hand out over drinks, the food is quite impressive! For starters, I tried the breaded fish fillets and they were yummy!!! Their sausage platter was delicious and you must try the pork knuckle!! I highly recommend it! However, prices are quite steep! Service was mostly rather indifferent
3
On Monday night I met two friends for drinks and dinner at Brotzeit in Vivocity. I was satisfied with the food (I am not an expert on German food and so I can only rate my satisfaction and not the quality) but the servers (the hostess that walked me to my table and the server) deserved a solid "C" grade. Here are examples of their service- unemotional- lacking in graciousness- robot-like- mechanicalUnfortunately this is the kind of service that I have experienced in Singapore, a city that I have visited at least once a year for the last 20 years. My recommendation: if you value your money then avoid "high end" restaurants of this type in Singapore. Instead enjoy local foods such as pepper crab and lobster at hawker centers and similar places

I have frequently gone to Brotzeit in Raffles Place. The service was usually bad and the staff sullen, however the food always made up for it. The menu was varied with good traditional german specialities. Unfortunately that is no longer the case. Apart from the fact the staff seem unable to take a correct order, the menu has now changed. Now I'm all for a seasonal change in menu, however when did pizza become a 'german speciality? Gone are the platters for 2 , instead you only get one choice which is the 'best of brotzeit''. Since when are honey pork ribs served with wedges a german dish? Ahh right..when you add a spoonful of sauerkaraut to the menu and when did a sausage plate come with chilli sauce in any traditional german restaurant. Gone is the black forest gateau and any remnant of the dishes that made it worthwhile.Paulener Brahaus for me from now on..

I went there and had few beers and sausages plater with my friend. food was not bad but service was sucks.... Since I am driving, after the few rounds of beers, I asked for ice water and continue to chat. I want my alcohol level to drop before I drive back home. One staff brought us the bill, I said later. After 5 mint another staff brought us the bill which I never asked for. I said later and I asked to fill in the water. The staff disappeared and my water never delivered until about 10 mint. We were pissed off and settled the bill and left

Brotzeit has several outlets in Singapore and I frequently eat at the one at Vivo City. The setting is rustic, service so-so but the food is quite good on average. You won't leave that place hungry, that's for sure! And without a glass of German beer, your meal won't be complete

Beer + shopping = awesomeSwung by here after catching a movie and can see the appeal, trendy location and the atmosphere is definitely busy. Didn't try the food but the beers kept us for a few hours, can even smoke if you're lucky to grab one of the outside tables.Nice spot to unwind from the chaos that can be Singapore

I loved this place. Having spent years in Germany, I can tell you that the food is at par or better than anything you can find in Germany. I loved the Tafelspitz, the huge salads, the best frech fries I have ever eaten, and the beer was fresh and great. Most impressive was the service and the atmosphere. It is rare in Singapore to have such excellent service. This place is a total WINNER

http://thechosenglutton.wordpress.com/2011/02/17/german-brotzeit-as-in-bro-zai-t/A commonly mispronounced restaurant name, Brotzeit (bro-zait) German Bier Bar & Restaurant, got my friends and I to actually ask the waitpersons themselves what exactly the pronunciation is, and, voila, case closed. Before I went there, I’ve always wanted to give it a try, just because it looks so cool from the outside.I still remember the first time I stepped foot in (the VivoCity outlet). It was after a long day, and thankfully, the ambience just made it better. It’s definitely a place for friends to chill over a table of german beer, sausages, platters, and well, maybe their famous pork knuckle. First time there, and not exactly for a main course, we ordered the Fischplatte.Fischplatte ($36.50++) :: It’s a seafood platter, with a variety of smoked / pretty rare / raw fishes and seafood, and from what I know, not a lot of people out there are fans of these kind of platters. But for me, I am quite a huge fan (likewise for cold platters and the likes). It has smoked salmon, tuna, prawns – all of which are, I must say, pretty safe choices of fishes. The only more exotic one is the anchovies. I feel that it is a love-it-or-hate-it affair with the anchovies, particularly because of its saltiness. First bite down, second chew in, it might still be tolerable. But as it goes on, one might find it too salty to taste it independently. I was pretty much licking off the plate until half the anchovies were gone, then I couldn’t really go on anymore. But it was a good dish I must say – good for sharing, what with the basket of bread that comes with it. If you’re a gigantic fan of german sausages, you’re in for a treat, as they have a sausage platter, with basically, ‘all’ kinds of sausages.Pork Knuckle :: This signature dish of theirs isn’t on their menu (I really have no idea why though). It’s in the mid-thirty price range, for a delectable, big portion of pork knuckle (it’s bigger than your knuckle, for sure). I shared it with my friend, and if you’re planning to have some desserts after the meal, I think it’s probably sufficient. I’ve tried Pork Knuckle at Brewerkz and Marche, I thought this is the best of the three.Now comes my favorite part of the restaurant, weirdly enough. Haha – it’s desserts!Schokokuchen (Warm Rich Chocolate Cake with Stracciatella Ice Cream) ($12.50++ ) :: Very ordinary cake, very ordinary ice cream. It was enjoyable as far as a dessert goes, but nothing special.Kaiserschmarren (Shredded Pancake with Rum & Raisin with Plum Sauce) ($12.50++) :: I tell you, this tastes SO much better than it sounds. It doesn’t appeal to me at first because of the plum sauce, but little did I realize that the plum sauce was actually the best thing that happened that night. My friends and I ordered the previously mentioned dessert on top of this. After finishing both, guess what, we were so addicted to this (I bet they sprinkled some-, I mean, a lot of MSG over the dessert) we ordered another plate of it. That is after our main course & these desserts, mind you. I don’t know, but the pancake, rum & raisin and the plum sauce go SO well together it’s like they’re made for each other from the day they were born. No exaggeration. But of course, this is my very personal opinion. It’s just, surprisingly good. I know that I’ll definitely not be giving it a miss the next time I give Brotzeit another visit (probably to get a taste of their german sausages, as it should be for a german restaurant).Impression on Brotzeit? Very nice, unique though confusing restaurant name. Always somewhere nice to chill after work, after a long day, with your date, with your friends. Dim lighting. Very neat and furnishing – the benches, the high stools. And at least an average to above average food. Worth trying

Having just returned from a week in Bavaria where we experienced the real deal at a fraction of the price, returning to Singapore where all of the alternatives for this type of cuisine offer equally uninspiting menus , is galling.Brotzeit is probably at the better end of the Bavarian beer and food market but the prices are rediculous.Portions are way too large and I always leave feeling uncomfortably full. I would gladly pay half the price for half the portion.Despite the poorvalue, sometimes you just need to eat some proper food and this is one of the better 'high-street' offerings

I had the best "Schweinsbraten" ever there, and I am from Germany, so I know what I am talking about. The food is simply excellent, no wonder the place is crowded. Still, the staff is very attentive, always keeps track of everything and never neglects their guests. Note that there are 3 Brotzeit in Singapore, I would recommend the one in Vivo City, better location/view and more space than Raffles' City, and the one on 313@Somerset can occasionally get very loud from the "music" (or what they call music) from the Bar on the opposite side

Food was really disappointing. Weiner Schnitzel was dull - supposed to come with a cranberry sauce - there was less than a tea spoon of it. Pork salad seem to just be plain salad with chopped ham in it. If you sit on the tables/stools at front they let people smoke and I was constantly having smoke in my face from other diners. Beer only positive

Stayed at the Fairmont Hotel which is right around the corner and found this place on my first venture outside the hotel. Not only did we love it but we went back the next day as well. Don't worry people, I did try the famous chili crab also. But, this was an awesome beer garden type place. Loved it, loved it, loved it. A definite must try

We decided to give the German resto/bar a try since I haven't been to one and the specials blackboard was beckoning us to partake of the pork knuckle nirvana. It's one of the al fresco restaurants facing Sentosa Island where you can get a clear view of Resorts World.Inside, the ambiance is casual and lively. There's a long bar and the tables were larger than usual and there were leather upholstered benches instead of chairs.First up, we ordered 2 types of wheat beer. The darker one (Weissbier, SGD 12.50 for a half-liter) has a full-body and almost no aftertaste -very similar to my favorite beer, Erdinger draft. The lighter one (Lager, SGD 11.90 for a half-liter) has that after-taste similar to that of San Miguel Pale Pilsen. Both beers were superb.The meaty pork knuckle (SGD 36) was good for two adults. The gravy was sweetish but not too empowering and it blended well with the meat. The crispy skin was well, a cardiac delight! Eating the juicy pork knuckle with the sauerkraut (braised white German cabbage), mashed potatoes and salad was indeed a unique experience. And it was so filling.We also ordered smoked pork sausages (Knoblauchwurst, SGD 16.50) served on a bed of roasted spuds and again, sauerkraut. What I really love about these pork sausages are their firm and crunchy skin. Together with some honey mustard and a bit of ketchup, they were heavenly... and it really went well with the beer.The only downside was that when I ordered a small basket of bread (Brotkorb, SGD 3.80), I got 4 or 5 slices of bread that I'm sure wasn't freshly baked. However, considering the prime location, the cheerful ambience, the decent service and the high quality of meat and the fresh beer, I would say their pricing is reasonable. Total bill amounted to SGD 94.95 including the requisite 10% service charge and 7% GST. If you're looking for some authentic Teutonic fare, Brotzeit is worth trying.For pictures visit:http://www.cardiacdelight.wordpress.com/2010/02/14/brotzeit

Their seafood salad is loaded with lots of salmon, huge chunks of tuna, and sweet sun-dried tomatoes. However, there were only 2 prawns. Light but filling, good for sharing. The pork knuckles are nearly as good as crispy pata and just as fatal.

lousy service

great beer choices!

tried their galansalat, currywurst, camembert, kasekrainer. wow they are delicious! However, the restaurant can be very noisy. The service staff is very friendly but needs to be a little more attentive.

Good beer to chill out

nice to gather and have a beer with colleauges or friends

lovely beer (I had the weissbier) I had to drink it and eat my salad in ahurry but they were both delicious and the serivce was good. The place was busy in the evenings and had been recommded by friend. Well worth a visit if you like speciality beers

I'm a big fan of Brotzeit and have eaten at both the Raffles City and VivoCity restaurants on several occasions.There is a good selection of German beers, bottled and on tap, to wash down a plethora of typical Germans dishes. Sausages galore (currywurst, bratwurst, nuremburgers etc) as well as pork knuckle and schnitzel are all favourites. They also do tasty salad bowls that come in huge portions. But it's the amazingly delicious potato salad in this place that keeps me coming back time and time again. If it's not served as part of my main, I'll always order a side portion ;-)The food is good value for the ample portion sizes and Brotzeit has a buzzy feel to it - both outlets are always busy. A great place to stop and fill up when you're out shopping or catching a movie

Service is great (unusual in Singapore). Food is delicious - can be indulgent or healthy - your choice. Good pre-movie meal (they can move you through quickly if you ask for it).

Great pork knuckles, huge salads and low-key place to hang out

Good solid German food, especially the breads. Great beers though doesn't come cheap. Best to go during happy hours.

Excellent sausages and the fish dish for our daughter was a hit! Came with a mushroom ragout that was a good serving and absolutely delicious.
3
Not bad actualy, but not superb

actually run by germans, but the sausages are not as good as in good old germany. but despite that something like the best german food u can get in singapore. beer is ok, something else then bavarian beer would be nice ;-) bavaria is not gemany!!

The kind of place you can go with a group or friends or by yourself. German food has good quality meats and seafood and Brotzeit has a refreshingly modern approach with their menu. So don't go here expecting a tradtional german drinking haus. Do expect urban simple decor, and fresh meats, breads and seafoods.I tried the seafood salad which has king prawns, seared tuna, calamari and orange and currants among the fresh lettuce. I had the bread basket as well which is worthwhile for the multiple types of fresh german breads. I had a late lunch on Sunday after shopping and the only thing that was a downside for me was the amount of kids running around the outside tables. THe solution is clearly to dive into more beers
