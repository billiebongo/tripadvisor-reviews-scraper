I have been having their seafood soup from Woodlands centre, Marsiling Dr and now Old Airport road. I must say their soup base is very consistent, maybe from a central kitchen. Prawns were big and fresh while the meatballs were flavorsome. The fish slices were of cheap quality -Mekong catfish. The only downside is the pathetic amount of soup.

This review is for the stall over at Old Airport Hawker Centre (not Woodlands stall) which I suggested to be listed. The seafood soup is priced at $6, $8 and $10. I was feeling extravagant and ordered the $10 bowl. It was so good. The seafood were very fresh and the minced meat has a lot of bite. Needless to say, you get a bowl of robust and flavourful soup.
