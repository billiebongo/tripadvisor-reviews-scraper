We both thoroughly enjoyed our food here. The service was attentive and friendly. We shared the rocket salad which was OK. I loved my ravioli burrata and my partner gobbled down his meat lovers pizza. One of our best dinners in Singapore.
3
The promotional set menu was value for money. The starter was absolutely delightful but the main course needs some improvement. Great service.
5
Second time I came: after rework, the restaurant is even cosier, with pretty good Italian quality food.
Service was very attentive all the time, always keeping the right discretion.
Overall, a very good experience.
Well done, Limoncello staff, and thank you!üëçüèº
4
I personally have quite a lot of food requirements, and the restaurant was happy to assist and made sure I would have a choice of food. the desert was lovely - sorbet in a lemon.
great value for price and well located to our hotel.
5
I thought the ambience was very nice and so was the food. The service was also good. I would go back any time.
5
I have been here a few times. And my experience with it is always good. Seems to be my default Sunday lunch place now.
4
Very good pizza, fresh ingredients served hot outta the wood fired oven. Doesn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t get any better than that. The only thing I would like to see is a better selection of beers. (Belgian) The wine selection is very good, and the staff was fantastic, will definitely be back again for sure
5
Found this gem of a restaurant in a random lunch when we had no idea what to eat. Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and impeccable service. Will certainly be back again. If I had to mention some cons it would have to be the air conditioning (or the lack hereof)
3
The food here is pretty good (but is not the best Italian in Singapore). However, the service leaves much to be desired. And unless you REALLY need to use the loo, do not visit the public toilet next to it. It was disgusting. The restaurant does not have a private restroom. Not the best experience and will probably not go back, especially if I'm entertaining a group of friends.
4
Good prompt service, excellent pizzas and starters. Didn't expect it to be so crowded on a Thursday evening. Space is a bit cramped and noisy. Access to restaurant is the funniest and very inconvenient if you're driving as parking space is difficult to find and minimal though we got lucky.
5
The food was really good. I has the crab pasta and my fianc√© had the ravioli. We got dark chocolate profiteroles for desserts. Thank you! :)
5
This restaurant is very good! The atmosphere is great, and the food is amazing... I recommend this place for dinner.
5
great meal - highly recommend the lobster pasta as well as the pizzas. also great variety of wine and beverages!
5
Was here several times and had always a great experience from food to service everything was fantastic.
Will come again :-)
4
Great location on the river; great if you have kids as they can run around; lots of space outside. The steak was surprisingly good; the pizza is excellent and the service very efficient.
5
We came across this restaurant as we were walking around the Quay area. And we were grateful that we did. What a wonderful meal. Not cheap but was most enjoyable. The staff were very friendly and professional. Would highly recommend
5
Visited on a busy Friday night. Staff appeared a little harried and service was a tad slow. BUT the restaurant more than made up for these minor flaws with really really good food, sincere service and a nice ambience. Affordable too. Will def return!
5
Tried 3 time this trip, very consistent quality, excellent pizza, pasta, and you gotta try the portabella mushrooms, will definitely go again, beautiful setting
4
Was there for lunch. My 2nd time there.the lobster pasta was to die for. They were very sweet to allow me to change my spaghetti to homemade fettuccine. Wine was decent n they allow byo if you purchased too. The place was roomy so u see many families relaxing around kids having room to wander. So it might work for those with family The area that they could improve would be to have more servers
5
Last Monday we went to this place for dinner and its kinder busy place. While we waiting for staff to attend us, There was a small boy who bring food for tables. He saw us and grateful enough to offer table for us. Even he take our order immediately. Pizza and Pasta was on our table within 10-15min. Our food was very good. Price was fair compare to other places in Singapore. Highly recommended for other who like to try Italian foods in Singapore
4
We had a very good time with the food serving and the recommended wine was delicious. Good ambience and the service was prompt and attentive.
5
I enjoyed a very well-prepared late night Italian meal at Limoncello. I had the special, which was fresh linguine with sirloin and a brown sauce, and my companion had a simple bolognese. The pastas were al dente and the sauces were uniquely and expertly seasoned. Looking at the other pasta plates being ordered, it was clear that each had its own distinctive sauce, giving each dish its own nuanced flavor. The portions weren't huge, but they were more than adequate. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some quality Italian food
4
Limoncello is located in Robertson Quay which isn't as busy as Clarke Quay. They offer indoor and outdoor dining and the night we went there for dinner we sat outside which was very pleasant.The service was good although perhaps a little slow but not enough to irritate and the waitstaff were friendly and helpful.The food was nice and the menu was quite extensive, we had pasta and the veal scallopini. There was a good selection of drinks, we opted for a light Moscato which was delicious
3
While we did enjoy the food that we had, the service wasn't very good. The portions weren't overly generous but the quality was very good.We ordered two pasta dishes and asked if they did garlic bread, which they said they did. However the garlic bread was not delivered and nobody came over to check whether our meal was OK or not. The staff were quite busy but it was difficult to attract their attention so we didn't bother in the end. After we had finished, we sat there for some time so we ended up going to the till by the door to pay. They removed the charge for the garlic bread from the bill before we paid.We were somewhat disappointed with our dining experience at this restaurant and probably wouldn't go back as a result
5
I'd definitely be back! The crab meat pasta was so good! Service was attentive, and the ambience was perfect.
5
I was impressed by the service that staff gave. They were attention to details. We were seated at a corner of the restaurant and an apparent blind spot. Service staff came on and off specially to make sure our food, water, and etc are managed
5
We like it a lot and will definitely return. They are giving $7.50 nett price for a glass of house wine or draft beer. This already won us over. The food is well prepared and tasty. But I like their Sister restaurant La Braceria better. Prices are reasonable and their service is thoughtful. Overall, it is a great experience.
4
After a busy work day I wandered along Robertson Quay and ended up sat outside at Limoncello. A nice, simple, straightforward Italian with friendly staff, an approachable menu and the usual mega expensive Singapore wine list! Had a delicious whole meal base anchovy pizza and 2 Singapore priced glasses of decent Italian wine! Good
3
The food was good but portions quite small. My husband and I ordered pasta.The real issue was the attitude of the waiter. We wanted a pizza for our two children to share but asked for a variation on one from the menu to accommodate their tastes. The waiter (strong Italian accent) turned his nose up at our request and was very rude and patronising. We weren't asking for anything outlandish but he made us very uncomfortable. I'm not sure what his problem was. He also seemed to have a problem with taking my order. Seemed to think it was up to my husband to order on my behalf. If it wasn't for the waiter it would have been a good experience
3
Ok. Too crowded went on a Friday night. Indoor and outdoor is pack with diner. Pizza abit salty. Pannacotta is average. Overall food average ambience ok.
4
Staff is very attentive and friendly. They introduce us on new items to try and patiently explain to us the ingredients.
4
food not bad... service was good. seems they are too busy & no time for house cleaning... could do a good organising clean up to enhance consumer experience... will still visit again, their cooking is tempting...
5
Pizzas and lasagne were absolutely delicious. Lovely atmosphere and very nice seats outside. Would recommend it!
3
This has always been a regular dinner venue for us since moving to Singapore. Unfortunately the last few visits have been slightly disappointing. On our last visit both entrees and mains were served at relatively the same time instead of leaving a period of time between servings. Felt very rushed and not able to enjoy the experience at all. The food was nice, but nothing outstanding. Dessert, the Limoncello cake which as always been a favourite was served with half a plate of chocolate sauce which was completely over the top and not necessary
4
This is a great place to take the family sit outside and enjoy the setting. The menu has something for everyone and the wine list has a few gems. Enjoy the surroundings and your food. Don't miss this one. Enjoy
4
Went for dinner with a group of friends at this restaurant at Robertson Quay. A good location and a good place to chill. As for the food, the starters were great - Portobello & Calamari. The pizzas, 4 Cheese & Seafood were good too. The seafood spaghetti was so, so. Dessert were not too bad either, cheesecake & Tiramisu. Not a cheap eat but can consider for a small gathering occasionally
4
I walk pass this restaurant at night and it feels quite romantic for dinner.During the day it's bright and calm, perfect for a business lunch.Menu is easy and prices are fair.Food is well served with good service.Not bad among so many restaurants in the area.
3
It is a lovely and nice place. However, service was poor. To long to wait for dinner. Although I like what I ordered (pizza and desert), however friends were complain about the spaghetti seafood
4
Very good Italian food, I particularly recommend the pasta with truffle.Good wine too, and very good service.The meet, imported from Australia/NZ, was a bit disappointing as a bit tasteless
3
The pizza was nice in a real neapolitan way. Pasta was so so and steak was bad. Service was poor unattentive and lacking for the high prices they charge. Not a friendly place to enjoy dinner. Each dish cane at a different time...some overcooked..
5
... in our favorite Italian restaurant in SG where we went quite often over the last years. Time to thank the team for many nice and yummy evenings with our kids and friends. Looking forward to coming back to SG.....
5
The restaurant is cosy with indoor and outdoor sittings. Staff is attentive and very polite. Highly recommended.
5
Wonderful kind service also for the kids! They walk the extra mile for you! Room outside for the kids to roam
1
My family and me went there on a Sunday evening. The only thing good about the restaurant is the location. Everything else is horrible. The staff and especially the lady who sits inside was very rude when we tried choosing our place or requesting for anything. The waiters seemed to be totally distracted and not at all accommodating. We ordered gnocchi, pizza and grilled mozzarella and then tiramisu. Everything was so average. The Cold Storage frozen pizzas taste better than this. The tiramisu seemed so store bought off the shelf. When we presented the Amex dining card she said the discount was only for main course. What ????? U mean pizzas and gnocchi is not main course. Anyway the whole experience for a Sunday evening dinner was so disappointing. I normally never rate restaurants unless the experience is really miserable. Go there purely for the location and nothing else. Lots of other good restaurants. Stay away 
5
My family and I really love Limoncello for the authentic Italian food and the lovely atmosphere. The owner, Mr Fabio, never fails to make every meal we've had there, a special and memorable one. The staff are equally attentive and warm. Special thanks to Mr Gopal who is very efficient and friendly. A wonderful restaurant that we look forward to dine at again and again
4
Typical Italian expat restaurant, offer good quality traditional food and service, I enjoyed the fish which was very pleasant
5
Great food with professional service staff!Nice recommendation from the Italian Manager regarding food and wine!we will back
2
Disappointed after having read all of the positive reviews. Had business dinner in private room, service was ok but the food was tasteless, one dish wasn't even edible. Won't be going back.
5
Love the food the ambiance and the service. Great value for money which is very unusual in Singapor
4
We ordered the burrata - which was so creamy that it melts in your mouth. Paired with Parma ham and cherry tomatoes - divine. We also had the lasagna and 2 pizzas - which were such generous portions that the 5 of us could not finish and had to takeaway! An awesome experience with down to earth realItalian food
3
Nice setting by the river and decent enough food. Slow service and not very welcoming were the negative points. Pizzas were ok, seafood pasta was good, kids bolognese was a good sized portion.
4
THis was an imprmptu decision and we went to Limoncello with two other friends. It was a busy Sunday evening. We still got a lovely table. The staff were veery kind, attentive and courteous. The food was divine. The service was excellent. All in all a wonderful evenin
4
We really love to eat here. There are option for gluten free & vegetarian food so both us could eat properly. What a pity i couldnt try their pizza because its too big for 1person. Because of my sickness,i couldnt finish drink wine although my bf chose a very good wine please consider to make pizza in very small portio
4
Tried this place on the recommendation of the hotel. Had the crab linguine which WA very good. Lots of crabmeat and in a light bisque sauce that was tasty without being overpowering. This place is also rated highly for wood fired pizzas which looked really nice,but as a lone diner I couldn't have both ! Also WA stage busiest restaurant in the vicinity which is usually a good sign.
5
Every time we visit this restaurant gets better and better. Last month we stayed in Singapore for a week and went for lunch as a family and ended up staying several hours. the food is really delicious, beautifully presented and well priced. The standout this time has to be the fresh spinach hand made ravioli but from the beautiful antipasto to the simple Margherita pizza, delightful crab linguine pasta and beautiful veal, not a dish was under 10/10. Absolutely perfect. The children were able to stay indoors and enjoy the air conditioning and run outside on the wide terrace when they needed some space while the parents enjoyed their lunch. the service was friendly and efficient and spot on.Would definitely recommend trying a bit of everything if you have the time! the flavours are amazing and this restaurant is now the best we have ever known it to be, having been visiting for many years. Keep up the great work Limoncello
1
The worst service we experienced in Singapore. Low quality food, terrible tasteless pizza, low quality ingredients taste more like fast food than quality Italian ingredients. And the service was simply bad beyond words, especially from the guys who seem to be perhaps the owners. They make the guest feel unwelcome. It is one of the wrost Italian places in Singapore and demand high prices. We will not return to this poor quality establishment with such bad service
4
Nice ambience atmosphere environment. Pizza very fresh and moist and pasta good.Satisfying meal and experience
5
I go here whenever in Singapore, there are always plenty of food variety in this area of Singapore but this is consistently great food and service. A must try if you love Italian style foods like me
4
Great food. Atmosphere was lively though.as a result waiters were kinda busy. Food was delicious and presentation was good
4
It's my repeat visit to this restaurant. Loved their food from previous visit but they seem rather short handed this time so service was not great.
5
After many visits and noticing some abysmal ratings on TripAdvisor had to write a review with our thoughts. In brief:- Way better burrata than senso (skip ham and ask for grilled vegetables)- Great pizza, seconded by many takeaway orders at the counter (the limoncello white base pizza is eye-opening and very good. I used to hate white base pizzas for being generally tasteless)- Pastas, because the crab meat pasta was so good we haven't wandered far from it yet. Can't recall if they have risotto but go to senso for that.- Mains, red snapper is always very fresh. The Italian sea bass is served whole and will not disappoint. Lamb and beef mains were always well executed and havent failed to disappoint
4
Had a birthday celebration there. Seated at a nice quiet table near the cellar. Menu was pretty good but they got our orders mixed up and one of our mains arrived very very late. The pasta mains were average to good depending on what you ordered. Desserts were generous. Would probably try sitting outdoors if weather is good
2
Their aircon has a life of its own! It creeps to the food quitely & cools it so fast u won't realise till you are halfway into the meal. Would be better if they knew how to manage the temperature in the room.
3
a must try dish: fried calamari.The texture of linguine is al-dente (thumbs up)advice to make reservation in advance for weekendSome service crew will pretend they didn't see you, but few of them are quite friendly and attentiv
3
This place was very busy. Ordered pizza and Penne Bolognese. The pasta was cooked al-dente, but the bolognese was very plain. Ordered extra topping for pizza, and got it confirmed. However, right before serving I was told they did not have the extra topping. Too late to change my mind. Staff seems overworked, but try their best. Friendly.
3
The place looked nice but it didn't live up to expectations. The wait staff were just too busy and service suffered - no water , slow to order, answered questions incompletely. Half the food came out but didn't come out enough. Truffle pasta was too little. Uni pasta was expensive but too little uni. Pork cheeks had a lot of fat and some mashed but no other sides. Was just disappointing for what should have been a great case.
5
We visited Limoncello for 2 days in a row on our last visit to Singapore! The place might not easily found but it's rrally worth a visit. Good view by the river, kind service and great foods.Try the 30 months parma ham pizza which was so so good and I would love to come back for their freshly made gnocchi. It's so different when the pasta is freshly made and you can really tell the difference. Also dont forget to try their homemade gelato. So good
4
This is a unassuming cafe which serves authentic Italian pizzas like what you can find in Naples where pizzas were born and are taken very seriously.It is right on the river across from Grand Copthorne so a nice walk to Clarke Quay after is possible.Park at M Social Hotel. Order the classical Naples pizzas, marinara, margherita and diavola for the best authentic taste.The limoncello and chocolate cakes were excellent too
4
We wanted pizza and our favorite place Bella Pizza was being renovated so we liked the look of Limoncello. Sitting outside on the deck near the river gives any restaurant a head start and we enjoyed that. We were eating simply just a pizza but most around us seemed to be enjoying the pasta etc. Management should have a look at their menu's - in plastic and looking tired. The pizza was good and their prosciutto was good quality. They have one beer on tap and other wines and bottled beer. This place is between a 3 and a 4. Good pizza, friendly staff, nice location. If Bella Pizza is open consider that as well
5
The place is not easy to find but when you find it, the food was good we forgot about the hassle of looking for it. It's not exactly difficult but it's not near any drop off point so will require some walk. Part of the place was under repair but no problem. I think we'll come back when the place is fully done, the outdoor area.We ordered some pizza, pasta and the buratta. The buratta was oh so good!!! The cheese was creamy and tasty, and perfect for other the sweet tomatoes and yummy prosciutto. Have to have this again!The pizzas were really good. We loved the crust, chewy and tasted good. They clearly use top class ingredients.We definitely will come back but expect difficulty on trying new dishes or have the dishes we already liked the first time around. So, maybe we'll come back several times
4
The food was good and very authentic Italian style and the service was prompt and friendly. This was my second time back there.
4
After a drink at Beast & Butterflies nearby, we spotted Limoncello.Turned out to to be a good choice for Italian food.As the veggie in the group, I was happy with the Linguini Truffle that I ordered. My carnivore colleagues seemed equally happy with their food.And good service as wel
4
Lovely place to have dinner, and then take a stroll along the Robertson Quay river.Food was good - burrata cheese with ham (appetiser), rocket salad (appetiser), Lobster Pasta (main), the seasonal Truffle Pasta (main), and lemon sorbet. However my gf found the truffle pasta to be too creamy and oily so that's why we had to order the lemon sorbet to cleanse our palette
4
Would prefer for the bread to be warm when served. Other than that I highly recommend this place for the food.
5
I had a bit of trouble locating the place and almost gave up looking for it. Fortunately, I decided to try my luck and finally found it. I was glad that I did not give up as the food was fantastic. The braised pork cheek was soft and melts in the mouth and the pizza crust was wonderful!
5
Had a very nice evening here with great pizza, delicious wine and awesome service. Very friendly wait staff. Will be even better when the renovations have been completed! Will be back for sur
4
Nice ambience with good food. Ordered the rib eye, portion was big and was delicious. Jus slightly salty. Ordered the grilled seabass which was recommended by the staff. Taste was good, abit messy when eatin as is a whole fish on the plate. Also ordered the calamari. Nice and crispy, goes well with their sauce. Overall food was good but pricey.
2
Average food and poor service. Took 15mins of frantic waving to get the attention of a server to take orders. Orders were slow and pizza was very dry. Won't be back
5
Amazing Part of Singapore in Robertson Quai... best Pizza & international wines in town... Great Service.. a Special thanks to Alessio
3
Mosquitoes abound outdoors. Our order was missed but waiter gave really poor excuse. Not honest. When it arrived, the pizza was decent
4
Diner with 2 colleguages. although we arrived late (9 pm), we received an excellent service. The food was well prepared and very tastefull, nice riversite location for ouside eating.
5
Good Italian service, however they not understand what ristretto is.
Parmigiana was good and risotto con porcini also. Good place for dinner next to the river.
4
The place is perfectly located for a chilled night watching people run and creatures swim in the river. The food was good and reasonably priced (for Singapore) and the staff were greatly helpful. Would recommend for sunday pasta dinner.
5
If you're looking for Italian food in Singapore , I would recommend Limonocello. From fresh pizza's to everything , it's all fresh, flavoursome. On weekend the place is very crowded hence make a reservation, but on weekdays you will find a table without reserving. Service is really great adds to the dining experience
5
Ask for Alessio, Great Guy that takes care for everything! Great Food and Drinks! Great place to visit with Friends, Business and relatives !
2
When to this restaurant as it was near the hotel and had good reviews. Not ue if it was because we were early in the evening but was not impressed. Ordered two Pizzas both were undercooked resulting in a very soggy centre. Neither of us finished theirs. Dissapointin
4
Love the cheese... the food was good....was surprised by the cold platter as the cheese was to die for..
4
I have been visiting Limoncello few times during my Singapore trips. Every time really great service (even tho the are always full!) , good food and great athmosphere.High recommendation also for take-a-way food. I will definetly visit again
5
We had been recommended this restaurant and were not disappointed after our Sunday dinerSquid ink linguine were perfectly cooked and tastyKids pizza was generous with a good thin woodfired doughAnd the fresh burrata was creamy enough and served with good parma hamPrice was very reasonable in comparison to similar restaurants already tested in SingaporeAnd last but not least, the service was attentive despite a buzzy nightWe will go back 
2
Considering foods, it's a little bit expensive option to have meal here but, it's located at the fantastic part of city which is the only one thing making this shop better. One western guy was very rude while other guys were very nice. Recommend only when you stay near Kim Seng park and don't have other option
5
Lovely restaurant with excellent staff and food. Have had both pizzas (real wood ovens) and pasta dishes and never been disappointed.
Highly recommended in Robertson Quay area!
5
excellent food - wonderful lobster linguini and homemade ravioli coupled with great service equals a wonderful meal plus beautiful pannacotta for dsssert
5
I enjoyed the dinner with my Friend!the food was very nice and tasty,specially the Ravioli and Pizza.!Professional and attentive service.!We will come back!
5
Booked Limoncello as a surprise to celebrate a brithday and it didn't disappoint.Excellent Burrata!!!!!!We all had lovely meal
5
Had their burrata cheese with aged ham and Limoncello pizza. Both are superb with great service. Will definitely be back
5
The location is one of the best on Singapore river, big patio facing the river and elegant indoor with the water feature.The service is fast in seating you and polite, the food is excellent.The sea urchin pasta is divine as well of one of my favourite Angus tenderloin.I love the place and how they treat you in a friendly way don't becoming to pretentious. The restaurant is one of a kind in Singapore. We will be back
4
Had dinner at evening time with the family and it was relaxing time. The food served looks presentable and the food tasted just as good. The staff were attentive and it is important that we highlight what we wanted/not wanted during our course of meal because it makes our dining experience a pleasant one! Definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a relaxing and fuss free dining!
4
We took advantage of the CHOPE EXCLUSIVE: 1-FOR-1 SET LUNCH (MAR) promotion for our cousins group lunch. I had the Starter - Burrata cheese with ‚Äû San Daniele‚Äú ham 30 month and tomato which was tasty. I loved the texture and taste of the Burrata Cheese. I also tried a little bit of the Oven baked mushroom with sauteed spinach and parmesan cheese cream sauce. I preferred the Burrata. For the Main course, the whole group of 9 had the Cotoletta alla Milanese / Veal cutlet. I thought mine was done very well as it was crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside of the cultet and was flavourful, but a couple of others felt it was a little dry and needed some sauce. The Dessert for the day was Profiteroles - Homemade custard cream filled choux pastry topped with warm chocolate sauce. This really hit the spot for me. My only comment was the amount of sauce differed greatly between each serving. Some had a lot of sauce while others only had a drizzle. The service was good and the staff did offer us additional helpings of bread. Just a note. Currently there is some construction work outside of the restaurant which made finding the front entrance a little hard for a new diner.The washroom is not located inside the restaurant, so diners need to ask a staff to unlock the gate if they need to use the facilities. It can be a little inconvenient at times. It is a great place for those living along the river, but not that easy to locate parking close by. It is either at Studio M hotel or on street parking opposite.
5
The quality of the food is top. From the creamy burrata cheese to the tender Italian calamari and my favourite lobster pasta.We enjoy coming back because we find great service, smile and friendly environment.Well done, keep going!P.s. Love your music background
4
Quality of food was excellent - the grilled scarmoza cheese, parmaham, home-made ravioli, pizza crust was light and made to perfection. All dishes were extensively complimented by my guests for the night and we even ordered additional portion of the fried calamari (the price was justified by the high quality baby squids). Staff were friendly. Overall great time and will be back again
4
Great atmosphere located by Robertson quay. Service and food were excellent. Definitely recommended!
3
Serving for the 1 for 1 lunch was smaller than kids meal. In the end, my kid ate a larger portion than me. Bad.
3
Gone there because of a promotion and at the same time gauge the quality of food.Not much of an ambience because of an ongoing renovation but the service staffs are quite attentive.Food portions are too small and lack of food presentations (the veal was placed on top of the fries,no sauce ,looks home cooked).Certainly not worth if there's no promo
2
My friend and I tried the 1-4-1 lunch at Limoncello on Robertson Quay. The starter and main course looked like they'd literally been halved! Half a caprese salad each and 3 small pieces of spinach ravioli as a main course. I went home hungry. This restaurant wasted an opportunity to gain a new customer, and shouldn't do a 1-4-1 lunch if they resent it
5
the service crew provided great service. the food was delicious. the atmosphere was casual and yet nice. love this place
4
Visited Limoncello on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.Good food, great pizza, good service and all at a reasonable price.Nice location next to the river.Worth a visit.
3
The restaurant is nice, but lacks a punch. Went there on New Year's eve. The food is OK. There were four of us, and we ordered ravioli with ricotta and spinach, ravioli with burrata and cherry tomatoes, linguini in squid ink sauce with mixed seafood, linguine in bisque sauce with crabmeat, and a pizza as appetizer. I have posted pictures of all four pasta dishes. Nothing was bad, but nothing took me back to Italy either. Maybe I was expecting too much.For drinks, we ordered a bottle of sparkling wine, and after that a beer and a glass of red wine. Surprisingly, the red wine was served chilled. Our waiter did take it back when I complained.The restaurant does have very nice outside seating by the river. We were not able to sit there because those tables had been reserved by other guests. If you plan to dine at Limoncello, I would recommend calling ahead and reserving one of these tables
3
We are glad that we showed up at 5:30pm as the place became crowed after 6pm. There is obvious shortage of labor at 7pm.Some of the dishes are decent, such as the pasta and seafood soup but others are just so so. The deep sea calamari is not bad but the $26 price tag is outrageous.The deserts are a bit disappointing. The cream used for tiramisu and profiteroles is not fresh and too sweet. As we visited on weekdays finishing before 7:30pm, we got 30% discount. Not sure if it is still worth it though ..
4
Always love coming to this place! The food is very tasty and the waiters are always kind & thoughtful
5
We return to Limoncello again. Love the ambience of this place. Cosy, lively and simply unpretentious. Lots of excellent dishes to select. Spaghetti bolognese is a favorite, so is US prime ribeye. Do try their fresh clams with white wine sauce. Limoncello will certainly be one of our go to places for Italian dining.
5
During last night with our Italian starstrucked son we had dinner on Robinson Quay. The food was brilliantly spiced. Sevice was super. We really enjoyed even if pizza chef was cheering on Roma and G on Lazio. What a great lasr nightüëç
4
Simple place but serve good food on a consistent basis. Reasonable priced.
Nice ambience and Friendly staff
4
We used to live in Singapore and always enjoyed going to Limoncello. Now every time we go back to Sing we try to get to Limoncello one night. It's along the river, but away from the crowds at Boomerang and others. The location is great, the service consistently good, the prices reasonable and the quality of food and wine excellent. Try the scarmozza, the pizza, but also the lamb, pasta's and gelato! Only the coffee is so-so, which is a pity for an Italian
5
We wandered in expecting a Pizza joint but encountered a full menu and great Italian wine list. The monthlong special was linguine with Alba Truffles (and quite a lot of them!). The veal ravioli was excellent, too, followed by very flavorful gelato
3
The visit started off well with reasonably good service. Most of the table ordered the lobster fettuccine which was really delicious. But after the main course, the service started to go downhill. It was New Year's eve and it wasn't even that crowded, but the waiters would walk by without looking at our table, it took us forever to try to order dessert, and also just as long to get the bill. Not asking for too much - all we want is some reasonable service when we need it
4
We had our new years eve dinner at limoncello. The food was tasty and the service good, considering it was a busy night. For appitisers we had the portobello with spinach and cheese which was amazing, alongwith the buratta and grilled veg and ham, which was also pretty good. Mains were pizza with a crisp crust, the tenderloin and pasta. The pizza and beef were good.We tried 3 items for dessert and loved them all - tiramisu, panacotta and limoncello cake.Good place to revisi

Had a very appetising meal, the burrata was the best we've ever eaten, the ravioli was scrumptious, and the crabmeat linguini was just right. For dessert, we had pana cotta was totally authentic.Would love to go back again.Only challenge was locating the restaurant, since it's tucked inside a condo and behind the car-park
4
One of my fave italian restaurant.love their pasta & tiramisu.would be better if their tiramisu serve in big size & more option for vegetarian.heheh
4
Nicely located on the river with attentive staff and a good menu of authentic italian dishes and wines. The gnocci was delicious and the veal was great and beautifully presented. Good desserts and a nice relaxed atmosphere without being over expensive as some hotel eateries are.
4
Even with reservations we were seated outside, but before we could order, I felt raindrops and jumped up to ask for indoor table. No such luck but Alessio whisked our table to just under the glass eaves where we stayed dry all night.We had octopus and clams and a salad for starters - all pronounced very good, Then bank ink sauce over linguine plus wagyu entrecote. A great bottle of white washed it all down. Profiteroles, limoncello torta ended the meal with shots of limoncello.All great.... including staff and service....very personable team. "We'll be back
5
A restaurant you can enjoy visiting very regularly. The food is great and you don't have to worry how to cover the overdraft. Very relaxed.
5
Limoncello has become the place to satisfy my Italian food cravings. Great food, price is fair and prompt service.

We have just come back fom a trip to Burma with 2 night stops both ways in Singapore, staying at Sheraton 4 Points (see separate review). Really glad we discovered Limoncello. Perfectly situated for us acrossd the bridge over Singapore River opposite our hotel. Limoncello is a traditional Italian Pizzeria with wood fired ovens, consequently we had pizzas on both visits which were superb. The waiters were friendly and efficient, and dining outside had a quiet ambience, made all ther better from some lovely rich egg shaped battery driven latterns which changed colour (will certainly go on line to get one or two). We are back in Singapore in March next year and will certainly try for a return visit. Thanks guys..

Returned and not disappointed Good choices food and wine. Good value. Good wine list .. but most importantly great food and good service.Value for money but while not expensive it's not cheap.Will return
4
Love this place..their pasta taste so yummy..love their tiramisu too.. they put much coffee powder on top which i like it. The italian waiter was so friendly. Would be better if their tiramisu have bigger size. Heheh
4
Celebrated my birthday with friends and thoroughly enjoyed the food. We had "cheesecake" served with parma hams as appetizer which was really good! Boston lobster pasta is indeed a must try and the tiramisu melts in your mouth. They recommended white wine chardonney whch goes really well with our food. I would love to go back again.
5
Had a seafood spaghetti lunch and it was very good indeed. Lots of different types of seafood and good value for singapore.
4
We booked the bigger private room for a birthday celebration. The room was very beautifully decorated and very cozy overlooking the river. Everything we ordered was done perfectly. Very delicate, good presentation and of course the taste was yummy. We loved every dish from the vongole, air dried beef, salad, ham, risotto, beef, lamb, ravioli, calamari etc. there was. Othi g we didn't like. Wine selection was good too. Would definitely return
4
I was craving some Italian food, hence the suggestion by friends came in handy. Limoncello provides indoor and outdoor seating. Food is mainly pizza and pasta, but also offers a variety of Italian starters and typical mains. We all ordered different dishes, everybody was happy. Plus: Service is very attentive and recognizes locals/ regulars. Prices are moderate. Why not 5 points? I was missing napkins (none were provided) and a bit more Italian style to the porcelain, etc
5
We were four adults from USA and visited the restaurant and must say it was absolutely FANTASTIC!We ordered two pizzas and the spaghetti bolognese and were so full after eating. Huge portions, fresh toppings on the pizza and reasonably priced.The spaghetti bolognese was probably one of the best meals I have ever had in a restaurant even in my journeys in Italy. If you are visiting Singapore and want some authentic and delicious Italian food, I highly recommend stopping here
5
Very good quality Italian food at a beautiful setting with lovely service all at a reasonable price.
4
Been coming back countless times, needless to say that this place has the best food and service given the fact that I am not a western food person but chose to come back many times, go ahead and try.
4
Took the carb meat linguini offer. Just right for lunch time. Great venue. Central location yet quiet ambience in the day time. Good for discussions.
4
As almost every week it is a pleasure to go Limoncello for an easy pizza with the kids.Staff is friendly, food is good and kids can play in the patio or in the pedestrian area of Robertson Quay. Recommended to families with young and active kids
4
Had the quattro formaggi pizza and tiramisu. Good value for the pizza as the portion was big, around 13inch at $25++, but tasted rather bland, with only the gorgonzola bringing more punch to the dish.. TIramisu was excellently soaked in aromatic, strong espresso while the mascarpone cheese was delightfully fluffy yet structured, Expensive at $12 a small pop.Very good service, generally friendly, flexible and quick-witted
4
I've tried the Limoncello restaurant on the advice of an Italian friend living in Singapore. As expected the insight was right. The management team is Italian and it assures that the culinary experience is authentic. It all tasted just right:- Aperol Spritz- Burrata with cherry tomatoes (wow with real tomato taste!)- Pizza Margherita with Bufala mozzarella- Espresso coffeeOn top a cozy al fresco terrazza by the river. If you are in Singapore and you want a real Italian experience, just hit here.
4
I'd like to eat apetizer and pizza,good music,good service and great location,also like the waterfall inside with the glass wall,very charm
4
Limoncello prepared a cake and birthday wishes written on a plate, and served it to my friend after we had our meal. It was beautiful. Really appreciated it
2
This is probably our first and last time dining here. Service was next to non existent. Took us quite a few promptings to get our order taken. Our server was supposedly senior but didn't know the promotion that they are running. After which he forgotten about our drink order. Our main course came before our appetiser was finished. Bread wasn't served to us despite a saucer of olive oil with balsamic vinegar was on our table.
4
Food tastes excellent. Portobello highly recommended. Service could be a little happier but overall still a good experienc
4
Great food. Great location. Great service. Singapore is not known for great service. This place is great! The limoncello shot at the end was a delightful delicious surprise.
5
Great service , awesome food & Super selection of wines to go with it . Authentic Italian and friendly staff servicing us ! What more - a perfect place with friends , family and even a romantic date !
3
As authentic as you can get in Singapore . We orderedPizza and Bolognese spaghetti (kids portion) . Honestly , it's not one of the best I've tried in the same price range .
4
We had another great meal with family, sitting outside on a balmy Singaporeanevening with excellent service and fabulous food. The gnocchi is "to die for" but all dishes including the pizzas are phenomenal. Great value, great location 10/1
5
My husband and I spent a lovely evening here while on stop over in Singapore our waiter Deepu was great company and very professional a great asset to the place we wish him and his family all the bes
5
Limoncello serves great Italian fare. Try their calzone. The dough is soft, fluffy and chewy. For starters do try the thinly sliced squid carpaccio. We finished of their homemade limoncello cake. Great place. Make sure you make reservations in advance.
5
We enjoyed a lovely family dinner. Service was attentive and efficient on a busy Sunday evening. Love the riverside ambience. Prices are reasonable. Salads are yummy and the pasta dishes are tasty. Desserts are great but the tiramisu could do with a bit more alcoholic kick !Overall, a delightful evening
4
What do you do when you crave Italian food and you are not in Italy. Limoncello was the next thing my partner and I found at Robertson Quay and we had a great dinner- the atmosphere, food quality, service and pricing was great. I highly recommend the outdoor seating and the CALAMARETTI DI PARANZA - deep sea fried baby squid. We had a lovely date night and would definitely be back again
5
first visit with my family and really enjoyed..It would have been better if we had ended the dinner with Lemoncello drink
4
The ambiance of this place is quite nice. Perfect for a cost date night!  Food quality was alright. Excellent experience altogether-- will definitely return soon!.
5
Great location, great food , friendly service... Excellent experience altogether-- will definitely return soon!..
5
It was a lovely night great services and excellent foods for sure I will visit the restaurant again.
5
Great location in the city. Its a gem by the river. We love the indoor seating. Service is attentive and adequate. We love the clams with white wine, lasagne, squid ink pasta and seafood stew. There's a house wine on promotion but too bad it wasn't available so had a bottle of pinot grizio instead which was great. Will definitely return soon!

As a couple we stopped in for some dessert and one last drink before heading back to the hotel.The place out the front has both inside and outside seating, and a good place to people watch as they walk along the riverside.The staff here had no clue and they were hard to understand. Although the entire place is rather fancy, and the bar looks well stocked, they're unable to do cocktails which was disappointing! We were wanting a Mojhito or Espresso martini, but no can do!Upon ordering a bourbon, the guy came over with the drink and it was incorrect and had to go back to the bar to amend the order. The Tiramisu was a ripoff! It was pretty much a small cup of whipped cream! Terrible for what you pay for! Worst Tiramisu i've had! Called for the bill and this took longer than it should have, and the lady apologising for taking so long.Everything at this place just didn't run to plan. I am glad we didn't have dinner here, and i feel sorry for the people that did, as i don't think the overall expectations would be what you expect.Plenty of other places along the boardwalk .
4
The ambience of this place is quite nice. Perfect for a cosy date night! We ordered fried baby squids, burrata cheese ravioli, crab meat pasta, tiramisu and wine. The squid was supposed to be a must try dish but turned to be quite average. Really liked everything else especially the tiramisu which is one of the best I have had in Singapore. Slightly on the expensive side but a good option if you want to have Italian food
3
Perhaps it could be a friday night, the entire placed was filled. Service staff could hardly cope.. We ordered a few pastas, pizzas and salads to be shared. Fod quality was alright. The ganchio pasta was nice. Everyone was satisfied. It was a bit hard to get the attention of the service staff. Otherwise, for the reasonable price and location, worth visitin
3
I really wanted to give this place a decent review as I have heard about this place from many people over the years. Let me start by saying that this place is not all that bad really if you like eating basic Italian food without real flavour and texture and at what is a reasonable price for singapore. We had pizza, pasta, risotto and the veal so I think we can base this on a wide selection of food. Out of the lot the risotto was the best and the veal the worst (go to Oso for great veal Milanese ). The bright spots are that the staff are very friendly.
5
It was difficult to decide what to order! Delicious food, from the Burrata with fresh tomatoes, Ravioli, and Tiramisu....start to finish. Add a crisp glass of white wine to the meal and great company and you have a wonderful evening. The service started out a bit curt, but the servers apologized for the attitude and made up for it with attentiveness and a few shots of....Limoncello! My friend and I came back a few times and the staff was very attentive and remembered our faces-and kept the goodness coming. Fully redeemed
4
This is definitely one of our favourite Italian restaurants. My favorite is the lobster or seafood pasta, T-bone steak, fried baby squid and Burrata. It has a nice ambience with indoor and outdoor seating and a bar which serves happy hour 1-1 for selective drinks. The service and food quality has always been great. Highly recommended
5
Limoncello is a GREAT recommendation by a close relative, and I am paying forward to just about EVERYONE not to miss out!It's exclusivity, strategically located away from rows of restaurants and bars, presents the perfect ambiance to every occasion. Well suited for gatherings, romantic dinners, chill-out drinks, solo, as well as family with kids and even pets(:Huge credits to the friendly staffs to make my dine-in hospitable.FOOD! - Appetizinglyy crafted to make your belly satisfied! Personal Favourite - Fried Baby Squid!I had Alessio who attended to me and my boyfriend during dinner. His knowledge on food with the right beverage pairing, has proven excellent. That definitely took less decision making time, and did not leave us disappointed with his recommendations.So, in whatever mood or occasion you're in for, give this place a try
5
Excellent food! Everything perfect! Location wonderful, service good! Price not expensive; a Lit off chimica in the men√π. I recommend it to all! Go eat there!
5
Very nice place.....pizza very good
Food very fresh
Ambient friendly
In my opinion perfect for business diner

all very nice italian calamari and pizza amazing...location wonderful... finally a professional manager...good job

Reviews are always difficult as often people's experiences can be different, but Limoncello is definitely worth a try while in Singapore. The choices are infinite in the Garden City and often individual experiences are down to the staff, and how well they execute the restaurant's brief. I often visit Singapore on business and I must say that the Robertson Quay area is fast becoming one of my favorites as the pedestrian area along the river is really quite enchanting. Having said this even this can change depending on the day of the week, whether visiting during the day or at night with low tide or high tide. I visited on a Thursday night and the restaurant was quite busy. Perhaps I over indulged a bit by ordering too much but all the dishes were great. Having plenty of time, I was able to enjoy them all slowly, from a simple tomato and buffalo mozzarella pizza, to a melt in the mouth octopus carpaccio and an equally delicious bresaola, both lovely with some of the freshly baked thin bread, same as the pizza dough I think but sprinkled with herbs and olive oil. The Grilled seafood plate was excellent, with very sweet prawn which I had with a salad. Dinner for two really... The staff was mainly not Italian which is expected to be so in Singapore but the food was really very authentic and generous. The Italian manager told me that the owners are Italian and very involved in the business, always a good sign. Judging from other reviews it looks like maybe the restaurant has some issues to resolve but based on my visit I can certainly recommend it.If you are in Singapore and staying along the river, visit Limoncello even for just a pizza

Walked to this location from our hotel and found out we needed reservations; however, they agreed to seat us (family of five with three small kids) which was a nice gesture. We sat outside and enjoyed the busy and scenic location. I'll have to say that for being the only table the service was a bit disjointed and the manager‚Äìwhile passing our table a number of times‚Äìdid not stop once to greet us. Additionally, what apparently was the "head server" seemed to spend most of the time barking orders to the other servers while not doing anything himself. One server was excellent: Christian. If it wasn't for his attentiveness and positive attitude, I would be tempted to never go there again, such was the smugness of the managerial staff. The pizza, while good, was nothing to write about‚ÄìI do it a favor by mentioning it at all in this review. Having worked in the restaurant business myself for a number of years, I would simply point out that there is work here that needs to be done, the food being the least of their worries
3
My niece and her husband had been previously to Limoncello's and told us it was a good place to eat, so we decided to go there as it was close by and they decided to join us with other family, They were disappointed as were we, the service was fast but not friendly, the food was nice but nothing special, and my glass of SSB tasted like vinegar.My niece said it may have changed hands as she remembers it being much better on her last visit.The outside area is nice but a bit dark, that maybe to keep the bugs down as your near the river
3
Dinner at limoncello was ok.Expectations where a little higher especially for the type of dishes served and variety of typical recipes from Italy/I tried the Linguini Nero di seppia and not very satisfied with the outcome, the dish needed better cooking of the sauce in terms of fish and garlic taste and a little more of white wine.Pizza seems to be ok few of the friends got different ones but the cooking was not to the point and the red sauce was a little dry not sure if the oven is electric or is wood cause the taste seems neutral.This is our second time at Limoncello ok for the price range and menu but as good Italian I would raise the bar a little more for more fine dining experience.Will look forward to another visit and review.Giuseppe
5
Chose this restaurant purely because we were passing by. Modern in design and also an outside eating area if you can stand the heat ! Air conditioned inside for comfort and that's where we chose to be. A good selection of Italian food which was served promptly, hot and tasty. Staff, all very welcoming and friendly, provided a good service. Excellent all round and we left well satisfied
5
The real italian genuine food. After many visit at limoncello i have enjoy mostly of the dish in the menu and i decide to put up review than they deserve.Limoncello offer nice variety of antipasti from burrata fresh octopus veal tuna and more to home made pasta and the real pizza moisture soft and light,beautiful steak from around the world to air flow italian fish,you can finish your dinner with almond limoncello cake or tiramisu' limoncello is must try for italian food loversThanks‚Ä¶:)ÔÅäFrancecs

My family and I visited Limoncello for dinner, as we were in the Robertson Quay area and we saw positive reviews on TripAdvisor.We sat outside on Limoncello's large terrace, which accommodated quite a number of tables. This made it the ideal family-friendly place to eat (as was evidenced by young children at the majority of the tables). The location and space meant that the kids could run around the quay-side area, without making too much of a nuisance to other restaurant goers.Both my wife and I had a pizza (procuitto di parma and rocket) and my daughter had a pasta carbonara. The pizzas were typical thin-crust Italian style, albeit not the best crust I've had in Singapore (in my opinion it was a little too chewy). Aside from that, the ingredients were fresh and tasty.The wine list is not extensive, but there were some good choices. Expect to pay Singapore-level prices, however. A bottle of the house wine ran SGD 54, with the better wines starting at around SGD 80. But this is more reflective of the alcohol pricing situation in Singapore, rather than any reflection on the restaurant.I have to comment, as well, on the inclusion of children menus...this is great! So many restaurants in Singapore don't have any kids menus, which is highly annoying when you just want to feed your ankle-biter with a meal that doesn't cost SGD 25++. In any case, the meal was very reasonably priced at SGD 10, which was much appreciated.Service wasn't bad, but wasn't great either...I felt the waiters could have popped by a little bit more throughout the meal to check on how we were doing. In summary, Limoncello wasn't a blow-my-mind concept restaurant experience. Rather it was a solid, easy and reasonably priced family place... In this context, we were happy with our experience and will probably return again
5
Excellent Italian food and well supported by ex-pats who live in the apartments close by. They cater for young children as well and large open area in front to play while adults eat. Good selection of Italian dishes and home made style gourmet pizzas.
4
Visited with my friends for dinner. Took pizza, lasagna and antipasti of cheese. All of them was very nice. Ambience and service is also nice!
5
We decided to take the gamble and try a new place. It turned out to be well worth the money and effort.
Limoncello is a lovely place with very friendly staff. Prices are very reasonable and the food is just good and tasteful.
5
Really good carpaccio that melts in the mouth.
Lobster with linguine - yummy al dente pasta and succulent lobster.
Nice ambience and great food
I will be returning soon!
4
Had a nice evening here. You can sit inside or outside. Nice view over the river.Location is good. There are a lot of cafes and restaurants in Robertson Quay. We had a quattro formoggi pizza and the grilled Angus tenderloin. Both good. As a dessert the limoncello cake. This one was really amazing! Ambiance is good. Waiters were friendly
3
We were staying in a dull hotel nearby, had dinner here twice, pretty good pizza good to share, the next time we both had pasta,not quiet cooked ,still tasty ,good coffee all at a reasonable price (as Singapore has gotten very expensive)We would go back her
4
I had the gnocci and they were simple but quite good! All my friends had the pizza and they were not dissapointed. Good sized pizza at an afordable rate
5
I brought a friend of mine from Naples whom was visiting Singapore for business and was missing real Southern Italian food. Limoncello hit the spot!!!Relaxing environment with genuine rustic Italian dishes which brought back memories of Sorrento and The Amalfi Coast. We had linguine on a delicious white sauce with an incredibly sweet meaty Boston lobster on it. The pizza we shared was the "Limoncello" with nice tenderloin beef (white base fresh mozzarella, fresh rocket, porcini) followed by an excellently salt baked live sea bass. All accompanied by a bottle of chilled Prosecco della Valdobbiana. We rounded up the meal with a delicious and abundant portion of Tiramis√É¬π which had the perfect balance of mascarpone cheese, chocolate, espresso coffe and no liquor as I like it!Definitely worth going back for a real experience, especially for the pizza as the dough is leaven, soft and how you will eat it in the Amalfi Coast in Italy.For the quality you get, prices are very reasonable
5
I would says it was an authentically great Italian food I've ever tasted in SG..It was busy night when we were there but service was very accommodating and they try there best to give us a great service.We had a fresh mixed grilled seafood, it took just a right serving time for us, even though it was busy they managed to served the food on a perfect time. And the pasta was the best, it was a fresh lobster pasta, the sauce was amazing.The dessert was a boom, it was a lava cake with a beautiful flaming effect on it, if you are a chocolate fanatic, it was heaven.Totally it reflects the genuinely hardship that they put in to the food and service in order to give an unforgettable experience.I will absolutely recommend this restaurant, with great food and service,it's a total superb package, nothing you can ask for..we really enjoyed it and we will definitely will come back as soonest
5
Limoncello just reminds me so much of Italy. Hearty and unpretentious food, lively and vivacious ambience, that little roughness around the edges, the easygoing vibe that beguiles a slight undercurrent of frenzy (especially on weekends) and earnest, sincere feel of the place all make Limoncello a really authentic Italian restaurant. I couldn't help but feel transported to Naples or the Amalfi Coast!For starters, we ordered the Le Vongole Saute (clams sauteed in white wine, garlic and parsley), a classic Italian dish that Limoncello does very well. We couldn't help but slurp up every drop of the savory sauce using the shells as little ladles. We also had the Calamari Fritti e Gamberoni alla Griglia (deep fried battered calamari and grilled prawns), another classic Italian fare. The prawns were really fresh and the squid was surprisingly tender!Then came a Pizza Frutti di Mare (seafood pizza) and a Ravioli della Casa (ravioli of the house). The ravioli, filled with porcini (a highly prized mushroom) and ricotta, and cooked in a cream sauce, were delicate yet flavourful, elegant but robust. The seafood pizza came generously covered with chunky scallops, squid and shrimps, mozzarella and tomato sauce with a really thin crust.A bottle of nice Pinot Grigio accompanied and complimented the delightful dishes really well.We were so full by then, we could only share a Tiramisu for dessert which was a very nice end to a wonderful dinner
2
Food was normal. Tenderloin took more than ¬Ω hour to arrive. Nothing to shout about for dessert. Quite inconvenient. Service took quite some time before anyone notice you.
5
Nice restaurant, good service. The Limoncello was real good. Had Lasagna for dinner. It was real good. I heard no complaints from the other ~10 people we had there either. Place was clean, prompt and very good.
4
We have been to Lemoncello many times and it is like a second home. Food always consistent and very good. Enjoyed each and every time. Service too was good last time
5
Definitively one of the best pizza in Singapore. Ingredients are just great and the base it's the closest to the italian one. The atmosphere is extremely friendly for families :)! Top pizza in Singapore!
5
I was looking for a place for a late dinner with nice wood fired pizza and searched online. Read some reviews for Limoncello and decided to head there. Arrived at almost 9:30pm and was surprised at the ambiance that the restaurant had. Being a late V-day dinner, the nice ambiance added brownie points to the place selection. As it was a cooling night, we thought of sitting on the outside as the inside was quite crowded, but the boss of the restaurant told me that he had a table reserved for us at the inside private dining area which was quiet and intimate. Ordered a Limoncello Pizza as we never tried beef on a pizza and it was interestingly nice. As a Risotto lover, I could not resist trying the risotto as well and it was very good as well. Surprise of the evening came when the boss suddenly came up to our table with a plate of Seafood Pasta and said "this is on the house, try it!" Boy were we blown away! Not because we were offered a free pasta, but because we the Seafood Pasta was generous in the serve of fresh seafood and it was very yummy. Will definitely head back there again for more
5
Having stayed at the Copthorne Grand Waterfront last week before boarding a cruise ship, we noticed this lovely restaurant whilst having a leisurely stroll in the morning. We decided there and then we would visit on our return from the cruise.......and boy, are we glad we did! The food was very good indeed......we didn't feel like much and they kindly provided us with homemade minestrone soup which really hit spot and beautiful pizza which was cooked in a wood fired oven........tasted as good if not better than the one I had in Florence!!!!! Finished off with the Chocolate Lava souffl√É¬© which is a must.......please leave room for it! The service was outstanding......we sat outside and soaked up the atmosphere......the waiter who served us( I think he was the owner) could not have been nicer and took the time to have a chat with us. We are coming back to Singapore in March 2017 and Limoncello will be definitely getting another visit from us..........if you like Italian food served in a very relaxed atmosphere, then you really must try Limoncello.....you will not be disappointed!!!!
4
Yes, so far I tell: this is the best pizza in town ! And I have tried a few as my hubby is italian ! Can it compensate the service ? The night we went it was pretty long, apparently due to a breakdown of the automatic system... Waiters are not italians, that imply a "touch" is missing. The terrace is nice, but could be improved... But I can't wait for the next time I'll go there 
4
Was in the mood for pasta but not in a noisy environment. Came to this restaurant with a friend as she is a regular. Only had pasta and dessert as the portion is quite substantial. Server is friendly, price is slightly high but quality is good. Location is not very accessible but restaurant seems to be busy with regulars. Outdoor seating is quite popular since the regular crowd seems to be expats
4
Just been here - waiters very attentive, typical Italian food with genuine taste! Wine bottle at SGD 58 Chianti, pizza quattro stahioni SGD 25, squid carpaccio SGD 27 - wow! Restrooms could use a makeover but not dirty. Very good alternative to Wine Connection, much nicer seating, view on SIN river, vety relaxing atmosphere. Inside and outside seating, all non smoking
1
We ordered 2 take away pizzas. It is understandable that by the time we get to eat them they are a bit cold. But we didnt pay $50plus for 2 burnt pizzas. We were told that the chef was not aware of the overheated oven. I am sure he was aware the pizzas were burnt unless he doesnt care and continue to serve us with it. We cannot tolerate being served food that is not even fit for the garbage bin. Will never visit this place agai
5
Best pizza I ve had in Singapore!..The service is wonderful.The pizza is authentic.Well worth the money! Reminded us of the brilliant wooden oven pizzas from Florence,Italy!
4
The food is good with the pizza tasting that of a good wood fired oven, it gets soggy after a while though. Al-fresco dining is the way to go if the weather permits, especially in the evening.
5
I got nice simple wonderful Italian food. Rugula salat and Pitza. The Pitza was one the best pizzas I have got in Sing.
The service was great and the restaurant has a nice quite location.
Very recommendable restaurant.
5
Limoncello, it is a nice restaurant sitting in a wonderful location of Singapore , called Robertson Quay. The food was very good and the service as well.
4
We frequently eat here when in Singapore.
Usual high standard of food.
Service much better than previous visits.
Good variety of food and drinks.
4
The pizza was good. We ate Margharita, the simple one. Only thing we dont like is the lights. There isnot enough light and very hard to see your food :)
4
Well, I have to say this is one of the best Italian restaurants outside of Italy. My most favourite dishes are the risotto and the ravioli. My family loves the food here and we visit this restaurant on a very regular basis. Last night I was recommended to try the Linguine con Zucchini. A summer dish which brought back memories of my summer in Italy. Spero che continuino a invogliare me con buon cibo e servizio! Grazie
4
Our family of 5 really enjoyed dinner last night at Limoncello! I need gluten free food and they were very accommodating. The prices were average for Singapore as were the portions but the food was very good. Our kids could scooter while we enjoyed a glass of wine as well which was fantastic! Will definitely go back. :
5
Excellent service and great food. Definitely coming back in the near future. We where offered the private dining room which was excellent for our company dinner. Even being tugged away we where never forgotten by the staff and had a truly enjoyable dining experience. Thumbs up Limoncello!
5
Whilst in Singapore we found this little GEM. We were that impressed by the food and service - we went back again a few nights later. Menu had options to suit most people - prices were very reasonable for the quality of food. We were very impressed by this outstanding restaurant we stumbled upon whilst strolling along Robertson Quay! If ever in Singapore again - we'll be heading back to Limoncello Pizza and Grill
5
I felt to be back home in Naples during my stay in singapore.Fantastic antipasti with fresh ingredient burrata home made pasta pizza and more. Thank you and see you on my next visit in singapore
4
Nice ambiance and good courteous services. Spacious area with several tables for group of 6-8 people. Good for meeting with friends. Food are OK.
4
The ambiance was quite nice and the food was good too. Our favorite was the seafood pasta that we ordered. Appreciated that our request to cook the beef tenderloin in 2 ways was granted.
5
Ate here twice whilst out for the grand prix. The Italian Waiter cannot do too much for you, anything that you ask for they will do. The food itself is excellent. I would recommend sitting outside and watching the world go by whilst eating.
5
I visited the restaurant after a business partner recommended it. Only had 3 hours layover in Singapore and made the most of it. Could not deal with another airline meal...Any international cuisine served in Asia is a challenge: when it come sto Italian food there is who wants pasta al dente, who wants it like Asian noodles, who wants it spicy or with more sauce... The reality is that whatever is provided has to be as close as possible to the restaurateur's ideal of perfection. I was off to a good start when a beautiful wood fired focaccia showed up at my table, to which I politely asked to add some freshly sliced prosciutto. It was delicious. The chef recommended a lovely meat ragu that has just been made in the morning and the al dente penne were better than in Italy. If you like your pasta a little more cooked I would suggest asking the server in advance. Al dente is the way it should be, but not to everyone's liking, so just ask them to make it the way you like it! My dessert was heavenly, recommended by the pizza maker who happened to walk by: Limoncello cake with ice cream and chocolate sauce. So moist I could not believe it, and the chilled shot of limoncello that came with it ensured I had a beautiful sleep on my 9 hour international flight. Will be back for sure. Next time I will have some salad and vegetables and make sure I am not alone, ensuring that I can share the conviviality that this restaurant seems to be able to offer! I notice quite a few tables sharing platters, enjoying conversation and making the most of a friendly relaxed environment. What a shame I was in a hurry and alone... Grazi

Is been awhile since I last visited Limoncello. Was there on Sunday night with 2 friends for dinner.Food was good as always! Staff was friendly and courteous.The Fish Carpaccio was fresh. Tenderloin was done to perfection (medium). The pasta, was well executed (Al Dente). We will definitely come back more often
2
Had been looking forward to a pizza, but this is not the place in this area. I've had better pizza and service along Robertson Quay at lower prices. Indifferent service, hard to get their attention or interest, outdoor so poorly lit you couldn't read the menu or see your food. Pizzas were very average, hard to cut and the crusts burnt. Wine overpriced compared with the competition. Registered our disappointment to the staff, but they didn't seem to care. Won't be returning, as there's better value and friendlier service in the area
3
We enjoyed the food but the whole dining experience was hindered by how warm it was in the restaurant. We asked the staff to turn the AC higher several times but honestly, I don't think it was possible as the aircon units were not blowing out cool air. It's a shame it was so uncomfortable as I would not go back at lunch.

As I am writing this review, I am still thinking about the wonderful night I had at Limoncello just 2 days ago. There is a kind of "at- home feeling" as you enter the restaurant and I was greeted warmly by the crew and even the restaurant owner Fabio. To talk about the food would probably take me hours, but to sum up the culinary experience- it was pure delight! The ingredients used for every dish is like fresh off the farm amazing. It is sure to please your palate. I will not hesitate to bring my loved ones over to Limoncello to share in the delightful experience that I had this week! Thank you for the memories

Very close to Singapore River you find this Italian restaurant - outdoor seating overlooking the river is also possible, but I had to stay inside due to the haze in Singapore.I had a splendid (and big!) Vitello Tonato - absolutely perfect. The pasta with black ink and seafood fine - but more in the normal range. I found beverages relatively expensive
4
Hearty Italian food done well. Did not leave hungry and a pity we didn't have space for dessert. Atmosphere was decent, and staff were attentive.
4
We had pizza. Really nice! It was a bit too busy though. Good for them but a bit noisy for us. Had too wait a while.
5
In spite of being located amongst the dross of Robertson Quay eateries, Limoncello is excellent. The food is very Italian. The pizzas are as good as any I have eaten in Naples. Its a find.
5
I dined here twice for convenience. The service and the food was of a high standard and reasonably priced, a few too many kids at times though.
5
Really good value for money and excellent dishes.
All the pasta dishes and pizza are really nice
Would also recommend the antipasto limoncello and the tiramisu, one of the best in Singapore
4
Usually I don√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t bother writing reviews if a place already has a lot, but I feel like I need to in light of some of the bad reviews here. No, Limoncello is not the ultimate experience of Italian cuisine, but it provides tasty food in a lovely, relaxed setting. We live nearby and this is often our default choice when we√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢re after something easy & reliable. Our √¢‚Ç¨Àúgo-to√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s are the Sophia Loren salad, baked eggplant entr√É¬©e, margherita pizza, and the crabmeat linguine. I love sitting outside by the river in the evening as the temperature finally cools down & the breeze picks up. The service is not the most attentive (I personally find Singapore to have lacklustre service in general) but well-meaning and friendly
4
We just 'discovered' this place so close to where we stay. Had a really good time enjoyed the caprese salad ravioli with cheese and a superb dessert of limoncello cake. Service was very good and ambience is superb! We will return! We are vegetarians and had some choice.
4
Quite a good surprise, cozy place in Robertson quay with amazing food. Their antipasti are fresh and good, could have done my dinner with that only but I would have missed the best Osso buccoi had in a very long time.Will definitely return and I highly recommend i
5
I would say one of the best Italian dinner we had in singapore,. Good food, good ambience, good service. The pizza served was outstanding quality. Restaurant located near the river side is awesome ambience. I had a fantastic dinner with my lovely wife...!!!. We will be visiting again soon.!!
3
In a nice area away from the crowds, this restaurant is nicely tucked away from the roads, offering a nice option for riverfront dining. Popular with diners from the neighboring hotels and residences, it offers authentic Italian fare at reasonable prices. Pizzas are average but there is a good selection of cold cuts and cheese
2
Over zealous service. Watch the extra unrequested wine glass refills and if paying by a mixture of cash and creditcard, make sure the cash amount is verified before it leaves the table. The menu is extensive and tasty.
4
Difficult to find. No entry to taxis. Try getting off at Riverview hotel, go to the back of the hotel, cross the bridge and the restaurant is directly in front. Pizza base a bit disappointing. Otherwise reasonably good italian fare.
4
Visited here twice as staying just across the river
Good quality food in a lovely alfresco setting with attentive service
5
Had a good experience in limoncello..awesome food and very good service..must try the chef's specials..good ambience and great food ..i can recommend to u with full of confidence..cheers ..
5
Sitting outside overlooking the river waiting for the rest of our party of 7, the staff were polite and served us with bread and oils while we waited.Excellent choice on menu and lovely wine. An error occurred in ordering but quickly rectified with an apology and handled well. Will definitely be going back
4
Despite the location at the back end of Robertson Quay, across the river from several major hotels, this restaurant caters to both locals and tourists in an indoor/outdoor ambience. The food is reasonably priced, consistent quality and attentive staff. There are regularly changing menu specials. Have been in a couple and large group setting and had the same excellent service no matter the size of the group
5
A restaurant my wife had brought friends to a month ago, I was wondering what all the fuss was about. There are lots of good Italian restaurants in town so another along the Singapore river? We decided to go tonight and had a good mix of antipasti and main dishes. And what a revelation!Even before the antipasti hit the table, the bread basket came with slices of the chewiest Italian bread. Then the Aubergine came out, a most delectable creamy tomato based fish!The pizza marguerita was amazing, so simple but so difficult to get right.The pasta scialatielli, home made was wonderful. Perfectly al dente, and complimented perfectly with a porcini based sauce.The Osso Bucco was yummy as was the tenderloin. Meats executed well, medium rare doneness was to our palate
5
Very beautiful restaurant in suggestive area of Singapore.Great ospitality, i celebrated my birthday here and I felt like home . Delicious real Italian food and Classic Italian pizza , pasta and gnocchi with Gorgonzola cheese are just amazing . The owner is one of the most friendly guy I ever met . Singapore Limoncello restaurant ....you are welcome 
4
Family birthday dinner of five. We ordered many dishes to share. Had a hearty dinner. Camalari, baked portobello, clams in white wine, seafood linguini in black ink, Fettuccine with mushrooms & wagyu beef, grilled lamb chop, rositto and 2 pizzas. Each of the dish was delicious. Especially impressed with the limoncello cake and lava cake. Service was good
4
Now after a dismal service in January 2015, I was in two minds to make a return trip to Limoncello. It took me 4 months to muster my courage to visit Limoncello again this year. Firstly it was my cousin's birthday & my nephew loved their risotto. Finally we decided to give it 1 more shot. I was most happy with the service and the awesome food. I have to say that I am in love with everything on their menu. Appetizers, main course and dessert. I am in love with it all. I love the limoncello cake and profiteroles. The risotto is the best outside Italy. I visit italy on a yearly basis and know authentic italian food. I have to commend the owner of Limoncello to have a very good and trustworthy manager to run this efficient restaurant, The last time I visited the restaurant and was upset by the disappointing service. I am happy to say that the owner has taken my feedback into account and upped his service staff's standards! Thank you
5
Great food, service and ambience. The Burratta was amazing so was the fat free Parma Ham. My favourite was the grilled lemon sole. Thus was my second time having it and I've never been disappointed. The staff are very accomodating. Will definitely go back again.
5
I am Indian and I love to eat veg food only and its very difficult to find good choice of food in Italian restaurant expect Limoncello with value of money.Italian chef will make special veg food on request for veg lovers.Here staff are always in attention & helpful with great service.I love to eat Parmiggina baked egg plant,veg pizza and Spaghetti veg in tomato sauce..Thumps Up!! with good choice of wine selection.Great Ambiance for couples.I always like to take my romantic dinner in Singapore, but Limoncello is the best memorable romantic dinner forever !!!!!!!
5
I went to Limoncello last week with my friends to have a lovely dinner together. We made a reservation to have a seat at outdoor as we prefer the ambience at outside, it is more relax outside and you can enjoy the beautiful view along the riverside here. The service staff here is friendly and attentively, they greeted us politely and enthusiastic, after they guided us to the seat, they offer us the menu and water. We ordered the Scamorza as the appetiser to share. After we finished the starter, the waiter served us the main course we order, that is 2 pasta, penne aglio olio and seafood spaghetti, both is nice. Other than that, we had ordered 2 pizza too.!! I never ever got the friendly and amazing service before. After finished the main course, the waiter offered us again their dessert. We decided to have a larva cake as dessert before we leaved here. I find the price here is very reasonable for the food I had. A good try!
1
This is the worst restaurant for service in Singapore, definitely go somewhere else for Italian food, plenty around this city. We booked to celebrate Mother's Day with all the family from overseas and after seated we waited 20 minutes before giving us the menu or being offered a drink. After ordering the food the dumb waitress brought all the entrees and main courses all together at once!!! So the table was covered with plates, obviously the mains got cold as we ate the entree....what were they thinking??? They need to train their staff, be attentive to the customer and bring entree first followed by the main course. In fact the silly waiters avoided eye contact, never engaged and avoided us all together. Don't eat here!!! The worst service ever! It's an expensive restaurant and for the money spent here you can have a much better experience at Oso restaurant in china town
5
I am italian, from Naples, the best city for italian Pizza and Mozzarella cheese.I'm living in Singapore and i go everyday to eat in Limoncello Restaurant and i can say that i'm not missing my italian food.The location, the atmosphere, the staff are fantastic. I feel like at home.LIMONCELLO FOREVER!!

After reading and hearing from a few people that this place does great pizza we went to try it. The staff were very friendly and polite. I love a little spice and so ordered the Diavolo pizza - spicy salami. The chef must have put the wrong salami as there was nothing spicy about it at all. So I asked for chilli oil to remedy the situation. I always love an Italian restaurant that plays Milli Vanilli from 1989 to get me in the mood. Add to the experience, the plastic plants (do people really still use plastic plants!) inside and after one glass of red wine we were happy to get the bill and move to somewhere that was really Italian. The lasagne was apparently delicious. But Milli Vanilli
5
The relaxing and comfortable ambiance of the restaurant goes without saying, but I do have to commend the service and food at Limoncello!Best dishes to have at this place are the Calamari (freshly flown in from the Amalfi Coast every week!) and Lasagna. These may be typical dishes that other Italian restaurants have but none do it as perfectly as Limoncello does. The calamari were soft to the bite, melting almost instantly in the mouth unlike the chewy and tough textures you get in typical restaurants. The lasagna is SUPERB, bringing me back to the days when my Italian neighbour served me my first lasagna in the warmth and comfort of her home.The manager Mohan is also a dear, checking in on our table every once in a while to ensure that we're satisfied and taken care of.All in all, it's an amazing experience there and I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for authentic Italian food in a quiet and comfortable setting
3
Went with friends for dinner:Setting:Very pleasant setting close to the River and lots of space between the tablesService:Average quality of service, relatively swift, but we were at the tail end of the evening, so it was quite quiet by the time we ordered (last to order)Food:We had Grilled Barramundi: average quality / average preperationPizza Diavola: good quality and good executionPenne alla Bolognese: average quality / average executionDrinks:Just water ;)Verdict:Average place, but the setting is quite pleasant and not a bad choice if one finds oneself at the far end of Robertson QuayAverage rating well deserve
5
My discovery of Limoncello was rather serendipitous. Ever since I returned from Italy I have been looking for Italian food that could live up to the true Italian standards. Limoncello came the closest to that. It was great food coupled with great ambience at a rather reasonable price. Thank you
4
We have just moved to Singapore so getting used to the restaurant life here. Visited Limoncello because it was close by and looked like it had plenty of room for the kids to run around. We were not disappointed, being situated at the bend on Robertson Quay adjacent to a bridge the kids had plenty of room while we sat back on the spacious outdoor dining deck. We had a friendly Italian waiter who was patient with us so we could not fault the service. Most of us went for seafood dishes and found the salmon salad superb! The bolognese was to be expected and the pizza was pretty authentic. Limited wine choice was one let down but we got by on the selection they had. Overall, a great venue for mixed family dinner and we will be returning, no doubt when the next visitors come
5
I always enjoy the atmosphere at this restaurant, sitting on the beautiful terrace and enjoying great food and very special wine. Service is fast with a lot of attention. Food is SUPERB, and bill is always reasonable. For me ONE of the Best In town.
5
Real italian product directly from Italy on daily basis. The owner and the chief cook are real italian and the cousine is excellent.
Never eaten a so good pizza outside of Italy.
Great variety of italian wines.
5
Friendly staff, beautiful surroundings but most of all great food! Amazing pizzas and Italian Dishes. We were even provided with chips and HP sauce which really reminded us of home! Excellent service!
5
wonderful location and setting, Truly lovely Italian food. The staff are also amazing. The menu is very good with some amazing desserts. the wines are also extremely good

I'am Italian leaving in Singapore for 7 years i have never experience high quality and authenticity food like in limoncello served by 2 Italian chef.. after many times been there i decided that they deserve this write up...I enjoyed antipasto limoncello include burrata ,cold cut ,mix grilled vegetables home made ravioli and t-bone. i felt to be in Tuscany pizza as in Naples.service friendly but not the best (but i understand and accept that because the restaurant is full every time have been there)ambiance one of the most relaxing and cosy to chill out..

Limoncello is a nice Italian restaurant in Robertson Quay. It is hard to review this place as it is a bit inconsistent. I love the pizza and they definitely deserve 4 stars. But the pasta are just good, nothing spectacular. I have also tried the meat there: perfectly fine but not amazing. The service is good and location is quite nice. Price wise, it is not cheap but also not crazy expensive (especially if you go for the pizzas). Overall, this is a place that I would recommend for the pizzas mainly (note that you can take the pizza away, a great option if you leave in the vicinity).

I had read a few online reviews praising the quality and authenticity of Limincello Pizza. After strolling past the venue last balmy evening and inhaling the amazing aroma of the wood fired pizza, my heart was set on trying it.I had such high expectations of what was to come, but after the first few bites I felt my heart sink as it became painfully apparent that not only was this pizza lacking flavour and authenticity, I had just paid $70++ for two barely there mediocre pizzas, and two overpriced lacklustre deserts. I'm not often given to writing reviews about where and what I eat, but I'm honestly so disappointed, dissatisfied and downright sad that this foodie experience didn't have a happy ending
1
We waited almost 15 minutes for the table to be cleared so we could sit. Had to ask to have our order taken, the food was very bland, service very slow except when we wanted to pay then the bill was brought after asking 3 times for it and waitress hovered over us until we checked it and paid. We left after paying and the plates were still on the table we were not offered sweets or coffee. We have eaten in many restaurants in Singapore and this is by far the wors

It was my sister's birthday today & we wanted to try Limoncello. It was highly recommended by my friend. It was about 8pm and we wanted a table indoors. The waitress brought us to our table. We placed our orders. My sister wanted a glass of white wine and there was only 2 in the menu. We asked the waitress to recommend and her reply was that she doesn't drink but she would let us try both so that we could choose. Now when she brought us the deep fried Calamari, we were shocked by the way she placed it on our table & scurried off. The table was not aligned and the plate was placed in the middle with one side sliding. She left a plate of balsamic vinegar & olive oil with no bread. When I asked her what was it for and if bread was to be served, she said oops that they were busy & scurried off yet again. There was no bread. Instead she was very eager to serve another table who complimented on her service. Now after 10 minutes, my sister had to speak to the manager. He apologized and gave us complimentary profiteroles and limoncello cake. I am heartened by his service. I truly enjoyed my handmade Amalfi coast pasta with mushrooms & prawns, risotto & baked cod fish. The food was palatable but I wish the service staff can get their act together. It is such a pity. Friendly service by the manager and a black face by the waitress. I think it will take me a while to go back to limoncello. What a way to celebrate my sister's birthday. Sigh!

We have been many times already to il Limoncello, it is always a pleasure to come back. Fabio and the service is good, the location is really pleasant and the food is very tasty. I recommend the starter with the cold cuts , the gnocchi , and the pizzas. Dessert are also great, I recommend the tiramisu, the lava cake (chocolate cake ) and the lemon sorbet. Overall a great restaurant in a great location.
4
A fairly frequent visitor here
Disappointed to see it now closes Monday & Tuesday lunchtimes ‚Äì even through the sign on the door said open.
Always good food.
Still sandard Singapore service.
5
This is place is amazing if you are found of real Italian pizza! Ate 2 times, and the food, especially pizzas were outstanding! Service staff was attentive and nice. A must try restaurant if you are in the area!
Ciao!

Nice terrace and setting on bank of the river. Good menu. Food good and delivered promptly. Would go back.

Limoncello Pizza & Grill is a rustic Italian restaurant and bar situated at the ground level of the Rivergate in Robertson Quay. It offers favorites of Italian home style cooking that are prepared with the fresh ingredients imported from Italy. The Service is Impeccable it has one of the very best pizza in the Singapore area that I have eaten, The rucola prosciutto pizza was a meal in itself, crisped-to-perfection dough, stacked to the heavens not just with rocket So too the calzone which, even when folded in half, threatened to topple the table meaning we had to get through it fast. it‚Äôs a perfect setting for an Italian meal we sat outdoor which has a nice view it sets the mood for the delicious food that they serve. You feel very welcome. The staff is terrific, and truly appreciative you visiting their establishment. There is a warm hello when you arrive, and love the sincere thank you when you leave. The place is run by Fabio Iannone, he of popular Bukit Timah eatery La Braceria, and Capri Tratoria. Having enjoyed an outstanding Italian meal and pizza it‚Äôs certainly worth a return visit
3
Location is great for families due to open deck space & path area for kids to ride their bikes & play. Service was very average - manager not interested to b there & any questions re menu were an inconvenience. Waiter for drinks very friendly but not too knowledgable. We had barramundi fish with mash. Tasted fresh but very much like a bland home cooked version ! Mash was lumpy & tasteless.
4
This was our first dinner on our first day in Singapore. We sat outside and although the evening was warm and a little muggy we were quite comfortable.After kicking things off with a glass of Prosecco, I had the Baramundi and my wife the Pasta Pescatori. Both were very good. (Be aware that the portions are just right, not American style overloaded plates.) We accompanied these with a New Zealand Pinot Noir. Just what we needed to round of our day and celebrate our visit
5
Been in limoncello for dinner with my wife, the restaurant was clean and nice, comfortable sitting, and quite full, but the service was pretty fast. Ordered 2 pizza, and mine with fresh slice of prosciutto di Parma was exquisite, and we share a slice of lemon cake really delicious. We'll be back on the next stop in Singapore. Recommended!
4
Food was quite good. We had pizza and it was very nice. My personal favorite was the Ravioi del Casa. Service was good, but could be improved. Both times we visited there were gaps in the service. The food was good, so we did come back.
2
Went there because the reviews were good. Food is not bad. Which annoyed me most was the atmosphere and service. When you‚Äôre dining at an Italian place you would expect hospitality and warmth. At this place none of the staff smiles at you. The main dish came even before we finished the starter. If it was crowded, we would understand. But this particular day was not that crowded, so why rushes the customer
4
Visited this restaurant in the middle of a torrential rain storm. Outside deck not in use and the inside dining room is not very inspiring but the staff welcome made up for it. We enjoyed quality starters, pizzas, and grilled fish . All pretty good and well presented. This area of Robertson Quay is well supplied with restaurants and if you are seeking basic Italian cuisine this is a good bet
5
Excellent pizza and other Italian dishes. Located at a quieter part of the river. Service can be poor during peak hours.
4
Loved these pizzas as they are not heavy at all. We had the capriccios and hawain, very tasty, thin crust no oil at all so no after effects after. Definitely come back here again. They do take away but you have to go and collect.
4
The set lunch served from Tuesdays to Fridays is value for money
The chefs are Italians and food authentic and well presented
There is also outdoor dining by the Singapore River in the evenings
5
Outside seating by the Singapore River at Robertson Quay. If you are into people watching while you enjoy a good meal, this restuarant is for you. Food was quite good (we enjoyed fish of the day). Family friendly restaurant and good for couples or gropus too - menu is broad and will keep everyone happy (pizza, beef, fish, pasta). Dog friendly too. Good selection of wine. Service was very good - we were not rushed at all and the waiters are friendly. Nice bar area if you just want to enjoy drinks. We'll go back for sure
4
We'd walked past many times for restaurant rendezvous nearby but never stopped here before. An open platform in front of two dining rooms looks out over the Singapore riverwalk. At 9:30 pm the dinner rush is quietening down but there's still a passagiata of families, night-clubbers and ex-pats to watch as you dine. We both had rucola and prosciutto pizzas accompanied by Peroni beers poured from their bottles into frosted glasses in front of us. The pizzas were big and loaded with cured ham, the rucola hiding beneath. They were very good. Service was cheerful and polite. After the pizzas we were too well satisfied to ask for dessert; we'll try next time. Definitely worth returning too.
4
I really enjoyed this restaurant, right at the riverbank. Lovely food. Theu want to serve quickly. But if you tell them you are going for a longer time they take care not to place everything together. So you are informed. Lovely to eat outside with this temperature. Place to go
2
This the probably the part of Singapore river i like most, a little meander flanked by Grand Corpthorne Riverfront and eatery like Ba Ba Black Sheep and Limoncello that looks promising.... onlyWe arrived at about 10pm from a staycation at GCW to have some desert and ordered Profiteroles (Homemade Custard Cream filled Choux Pastry topped with warm Chocolate Sauce) & Lava cake (Molten Chocolate Souffl√É¬© Flamed with Orange Liqueur)The Profiteroles arrived straight out of the fridge in a small glass container with SOLID chocolate sauce, looks like an extra desert they kept but brought it out when we ordered. Taste ok thought but disappointed they didn't bother to warm the sauce.Lava cake was OK, with the right sweetness, richness and chocolate taste. The flaming orange liquer gives it a dramatic finish both visually and taste-wise.The staff looks quite disorganized and uncoordinated when I stoood near the pizza counter to show my kids how they make the pizza. Did they all have a one tim bad day? Such a pity, the location is so good and this is a place I would return... if the food and service were bette

The restaurant is placed right in Riverside, which in my opinion is one of the most pleasant walks in the evening you can have in Singapore, either as a couple of as family.The dishes are real Italian taste, at least the ones i've tasted, and surely the pizza is comparing with a good one you would eat in Italy. The dishes are not over-elaborated (take the Barramundi grilled for instance), hence the taste of the good quality food.being in Singapore, where NOTHING is cheap and restaurants are at exorbitant prices, Limoncello compare rather fair with most of others of same class and surely is a lot cheaper than Otto, for example.An happy return over
3
honestly, i have been eating here for the past 1.5 years because we stay right above there. there's 10% discount if you just quote youre a rivergate resident ( you need to show your card though)these are the only things we stick by: -mozerella eggplant stuff-seafood black ink risotto-seafood spaghetti pasta- (tried once) wagyu beef egg pasta thing.... (wasnt that good)All in all, this place has good and bad days. There's a time where they messed up my fcuking bill 3 times in a row. They take better care of whites (i'm asian but i eat there all the time, so my service is decent to say the least
4
This is one of my go to Italian restaurants in Singapore. It's in a good location, by the river with a nice outdoor sitting area. Very family friendly - if you go around 6pm on a weekend you will find lots of families with young children eating here. The food is good and consistent. I like their Burata as a starter to share, the pastas and pizzas are always great. A nice place to spend an evening with friends
4
Have walked past on numerous occasions but today I walked in and had a great pizza. Authentic and very tasty. Service was good (by Singapore standards!) and it wasn't expensive. So not only great pizza, but good value too.
5
I love this restaurant, i've had the best pizzas of Singapore. The location is amazing by the river with the huge terrasse. You can go as a group, for a romantic dinner or event with a familu, I highly recommend!
5
Pizza is very very good.crispy and will seasoned. Service fast and right price. Back with friends......................

This is the place for good authentic italian food. The ravioli is definitely the best I have tried. Besides good food, lovely ambience and friendly service. Will surely go back for more

Horrible service. Made a reservation for 6 for this restaurant to celebrate my friend's birthdday upon getting to know about it on Eatshopplay book. They were having a 1 for 1 main course and it stated clearly on the book that it was only not available on eve of and on public holidays. I double checked this promotion with the lady whom answered the phone and she assured me that this promotion is available on Saturday, Upon reaching the restaurant, we were told that this promotion is not available by the staff after checking it out with a female manager. And even after showing them that it wasn't stated in the T&Cs, the female manager went on to say that it's only for Mondays-Thursdays and she was pulling a grumpy face the whole time. Clearly, they are not aware of their own promotions and they were putting the blame on the publisher of the promotion book (which they should have checked before allowing the publisher to go ahead with print). With no sort of apologies, we were totally turned off by their service and left the restaurant. Thanks for ruining the birthday dinner
5
I had lunch here on my last day of my last trip and I can't speak highly enough of the food and the service. It was so good, I had three courses when I only intended to have one! I was well attended but not pestered. I'm only sorry I didn't go here earlier as it was right across the river from my hotel. The prices were excellent too - great value
1
We came to this restaurant with our 2 kids to enjoy a pizza. As we reached the restaurant, we had to wait outside for someone to attend us. 1) A 1st woman waiter came to ask if we had made a reservation, which we hadn't. 2) Minutes later, another waiter, a guy this time, came to ask the same question. 3) And another one few minutes after. During that time, the 2 first waiters did not seem to consider trying to arrange a table for us. 4) Subsequently, the first lady waiter came again and asked us how many people we were ! Strange that she did not notice that, or even asked us the question, the first time. She proposed to wait at the bar while they would prepare the table. At that moment, 15 minutes after we had arrived, we thought : "yes... we are going to have a nice pizza and enjoy a glass of proseco".Sad to say that we didn't !!! As while we were waiting at the bar, a couple who had arrived while we were waiting at the entrance, has been proposed a table... of 4 ! Obviously we went to request clarification and explanation why we were not proposed the table of 4 before the couple. We have been given a non-sense answer and no apologies! In view of this, terrible service quality and lack of respect we decided to leave, enjoy a pizza elsewhere on Robertson Quay, and never come back to this place
4
I had a candlelight dinner (with my Brother ;-)) on a nice Thursday evening there and both of us had a Pizza. I was positively surprised about the good quality of Pizza, the size of it, the flexibility of the waiters and they even served Perroni beer (felt almost like at home :-))
1
We ordered minestrone, antipasti limoncello and calzone. There is some sand in the soup, I hope it is because of the wind on the street. We request to have antipasti and calzone to reach together, but we had calzone reaching first. The bread is so burnt that I can only taste the bitter burnt. The ingredients inside seems like being combined together without thinking. The tomato pur√©e on top taste like canned pur√©e. I almost vomited that I can't finish it even a quarter piece. The table was unstable that we weren't able to cut our food nicely. My bf an Italian said its the worst calzone he ever tried in his life. The antipasti has very strong pork smell, very salty. (I don't blame them on this as I personally don't like pork smell) my bf thinks its fine. We finally couldn't take it anymore, so we didn't order dessert and left. It's our first and last visit
5
...Good Italian food...Nice Ambience...Having been dining at Limoncello for the past 3 years, every visit has the element of surprise! Their homemade ravioli is a must try. Pizzas are already the talk of the town, have it thin crust or True Napolitana style, you decide. Personally i opt for the traditional.Thanks Limoncello ...See you soon !!
1
We arrived for dinner at 6.30 without a booking. They offered to seat us on wet seats. Seriously. We left.
5
We walked along the river to Robertson Quay to build up an appetitie for this restaurant. So pleased we did. If you love Italian food, I would definately recommend paying a visit

My quest for an authentic, simple and tasty pizza Napoli style started one year ago when I moved to the Lion's City. Today, I have finally found it at Limoncello! The newly arrived chef from Naples can make a very tasty pizza with simply and fresh ingredients directly flown from Italy. As an Italian expat since more than 20 years I felt like I was eating it in my own country! Go to Limoncello for this amazing experience

While the Caprese was ok, for the main course We ordered pasta with duck , and the gnocchi. The gnocchi was bland mush that was over cooked and then reheated with a flavourless sauce, and duck was far too salty to the point of being in edible and served with basic egg noodles that appeared to come from one of those cheap packet on the supermarkets it definitely wasn't pasta.. They were sent back and we left... The manager made the comment saying he tried the pasta and it was a bit bland... Considering it wasn't pasta and the salt levels were off the scale, I suspect that either he knew that it was egg noodles or he hadn't tasted it... It's a shame as we live nearby and always thought that it was a nice location to dine, we will walking a bit further down the river in the future..

Return visit based on previous good experiences and not disappointed.Lunch time visit, 3-4 tables in use.Excellent quality food, good value. In particular the lunchtime menu for $24 is very good value, three course and glass of wine or soft drinks.Will defiantly visit again as quality of food makes up for service

Generally there's not a lot of fine control of the accelerator pedal of restaurant service in Singapore. Either it is non-existent and you hardly see staff all night, or it is over-the-top and they hover over you while you are eating. Limoncello fell into the "hovering" category the night we were there. Before we'd turned a page in the menu, someone was standing over the table with pencil poised to take the order, and as we were finishing the courses, staff were at the ready a "discrete" 5 meters away to swoop in and clear the table. It wasn't that they were full and needed the table back, it was just a misguided idea of what "good service" was. So, what is actually a fairly laid-back location, alfresco by the river at the very far end of Robertson Quay, felt a bit rushed. I guess a bit of over-service is a lot better than under-service, but this is such a nice, mellow spot... it feels uptight when it should feel relaxed. The staff do seem incredibly professional and friendly, so I think it is more to do with coordination between themselves (we had at least 5 different people serve us through the night) than anything else.We started with a great pizza, and if you were looking for a spot to share a pizza and beer then I'd recommend Limoncello whole-heartedly. The alfresco area is very pretty, and if you can get the staff to stop hovering then this would be an intimate spot to chat and enjoy the company.Unfortunately it went downhill with the main courses... an overly dry duck confit pasta and an overcooked cod dish. The pizza guy knows what he's doing but the rest of the kitchen team let him down. Dessert was pretty to look at (lemon gelato inside a lemon, with berries on the side), but the berries weren't in season and were flavourless... probably frozen or overly refrigerated. It would have been much nicer if the chef had thought of seasonal flavours rather than appearance. Mango or pomelo or whatever else is fresh in the market would have worked just as well with the gelato.Coffee was excellent and the restaurant is dog-friendly, which is fantastic. I'll go back for another pizza and coffee but I think I'll skip the rest of the menu

We came here on a quiet Sunday night - just walked in and we were lucky that there were still tables available. Service was very fast and efficient and the food came out quickly, but the food could have been better we thought.The caprese salad we ordered was well-seasoned but the tomatoes seemed unripe and not quite as tasty as we hoped. I had the ossobucco which was not bad and fell right off the bone, but the presentation was very lacking - just a pile of meat in sauce dumped on top of some insignificant mash potatoes. The lamp was also tasty, with lovely mint sauce and much better presentation. The chocolate lava cake was very yummy though! So at least dinner ended on a high note. Lovely ambience and atmosphere and a great area (Robertson Quay is by far our favourite place to eat in Singapore) - just a pity that the food wasn't quite as authentic as we had hoped

I‚Äôve never left a review on Trip advisor however when I saw the sticker 'Recommended by Trip advisor' in the restaurants window I felt compelled to.Every restaurant has good days and bad, which is fine, however when they refuse to take responsibility for their actions, well this is the reason for this review:We went with two young kids as its close to home, and close to their bed time. After asking for water 3 times as well as the wine we had ordered 3 times, we were wondering where our entree was which we had ordered about an hour before. Obviously the task of filling a glass with water and wine was a strenuous activity and the staff had to recover before sticking some Burata and cold cuts on a plate. When we finally managed to nail down a staff member who obviously were extremely embarrassed by their previous mistakes ( this is the only reason I could think of why they rushed past our table while avoiding eye contact, or maybe we are an extremely ugly family!!??) they told us we hadn‚Äôt ordered this. How silly of me, I must have had an out of body experience where I asked for Burrata cheese ( as well as the wine and water). I re-ordered the cheese and double checked the rest of our order just in case I had the same out of body experience. I also informed them our kids were past their bed time by this stage and we would need to eat soon so to ensure they did not become any uglier than they already were, otherwise we would cut our losses and go to Ba Ba black sheep.Sure enough the cheese came out which was pleasant enough if you enjoy food which tastes like the chewing gum you peel off the bottom of your shoe, and we passed another 30 minutes waiting for 2 pastas and 2 medium steaks. Given the amount of time it was taking, I was really looking forward to a taste and visual extravaganza, this could be the only reason it was taking so long as I reckon 8 minutes is probably standard to cook what we had ordered. Heston must have been in the back there adding his touch.Well the visual extravaganza was a couple of steaks plonked on a plate and some cream which had a few bits of pasta in there. The mind bending devices I had consumed earlier had also kicked in as I could only see one bowl of pasta rather than the two we had ordered and double checked.After scraping the top layer off each meal (in case of added spit) we didn‚Äôt bother asking for our other pasta dish as our ugly kids were now in full devil mode and we had to hit the eject button. I made sure I paid my bill first (so they didn‚Äôt think I was angling for a freebee) and then politely informed them of the horrendous dining experience we had.We my polite must have been their version of some crazy person foaming at the mouth as there was no apology from the manager (as well as the owner listening intently in the background), and all they offered was a refund on the meal which I thought I had ordered, double checked but obviously had one of those out of body experiences which happen so often in Singapore. When we finally managed to nail down a staff member who obviously were extremely embarrassed by their previous mistakes ( this is the only reason I could think of why they rushed past our table while avoiding eye contact, or maybe we are an extremely ugly family!!??) they told us we hadnt ordered this.

Lets start with the most important thing- the food! I'll admit I was not expecting much, thought it would be an overpriced tourist-trap, but YUM.. It was pure italian deliciuos pizza.. One of the Best I've had! Fresh ingrediens, crisp and the size is huge.. Could easily have shared with an adult. They offered me a doggybag, Nice of Them but stayed in the hotel just across the river. I would go again if I had more time here. Price was ok - size of the portions taken into consideration.. But smaller portions and a smaller price would have made this review a pure 5! Location and the view to the river is absoluty perfect!

My husband & I are from New Jersey where we were spoiled with the availability of the best, authentic Italian pizza. We were disappointed when we found that it was hard to find decent pizza here in Singapore. Last week we were pleasantly surprised to find this little place and even more thrilled when we tried the pizza. It brought us right back to our favorite pizzeria back in Jersey. The woodburning stove and fresh ingriedients are the key...we'll definitely be going back!

Huge decking area that was hardly being used.
Pizza was large but not much choice for veggies.
Looks very interesting from above as there is a serpentine swimming pool on the roof.
5
The food was excellent, reasonably priced, staff very friendly and attentive. Never felt rushed, we could have sat there and watch the world go by all evening,went twice in 4 days!

Has to be one of the best places to eat in Singapore at this price. Much less hassle than at the Boat Quay too. I've been a few times in the last few months and always enjoyed it. Off again tonight.

Nice restaurant by the river eat inside or out. The pizza is thin crust and on the large size but if you want to share its not a problem.Pizza is not all there is as they have a lot to choose from on the menuThe staff are all very friendl

Limoncello was right over the river from the Grand Copthorne Waterfront Hotel. The gnocchi were light and the Bolognese sauce was extremely tasty. The scallopini limoncello was very sollid. Wines, as usual in Singapore, were expensive, but decent. Service is slow and sitting inside one night was very hot, as it seemed that the air conditioner could not keep up. We ate there a second night because of the proximity to the hotel, sat outside along the Singapore River and had a much more pleasant evening, with very attentive service
3
quality of food, athmosphere and price same as last visit (a few month back), but service was really poor. One of us had to wait for one hour for his main course to arrive and the waiter pourred wine all over the table.Will probably not retur

Was expecting so much more from website. We went here for Saturday lunch and the place actually looked like it was closed. There were a couple of other tables occupied but we were treated like they were staying open just to serve us!!! Mains arrived before we had finished starter and then my husbands plate was removed before I had finished eating my main and he was asked if he wanted dessert and when he declined the bill was presented and I was still eating!!!!Nothing wrong with the food and good value but the service really let this place down. Much better places to eat in Singapore.A minor point but the toilets were outside the restaurant; we were told to use the disabled toilet which could have been used by anyone walking along the river. It was dirty and not what you would expect for a restaurant

My wife and I had dinner at Limoncello Pizza and Grill today. We had a very nice evening and a good overall experience. The food was above average and reasonably priced. The service staff was attentive and friendly. The ambiance was good and enjoyable. Some minor flaws in food (Slightly under-cooked risotto, Cold Bread) could be easily overlooked

Mozzarella was first class iro taste and texture, pizza thin and crispy, ravioli and other pasta had real taste and cooked al dente, service on a busy evening was slow, mixed up one order.We sat outdoor, casual but decent setting. Good for family: kids can play in traffic free environment.Would we go again: YE

The restaurant offers a large menu. Pizzas are large and juicy,... Pasta dishes are also generous. It also offers discount for residents at Rivergate condominium, plus an outdoor area if weather is not that hot. You can enjoy a different atmosphere depending on whether you visit for lunch or dinner. At dinner time, lighting is just a bit too dark, however pleasant all together.The outdoor area is quite as it faces the river and there is no road. However I would avoid sitting outside during weekends as there are so many kids playing around,... Food is good

We have been here twice in the past week as we were so impressed the first time.
Bread with Oil and Balsamic are served to start.
The Rocket salad was lovely and perfect to share alongside a main
The tiramisu was amazing.

My wife and I went here for our anniversary dinner while in Singapore - DISASTER! Only the barman and head waiter seemed to have a clue and rest of staff were useless. My wife's meal arrived as ordered with the fish well over-cooked. And, she had almost finished her meal before mine actually arrived at the table and this only after 2 separate complaints to staff. The only good thing was that the wine dampened the pain. We left as soon as possible and I will definitely not eat here again

I am totally in love with Limoncello! And I am Italian so you can trust my advice :) I go there often and I always enjoy the delicious food and the al-fresco dining atmosphere. Pizza is great: it's probably the only pizzeria in SIngapore that provides fresh dairy mozzarella, imported directly from Italy. Besides pizza, I would recommend Antipasto della casa, wich includes all the best Italian cold cuts and fresh burrata (if you have never tried burrata before, Limoncello is the place to go!), and Gnocchi alla Sorrentina, a simple but very tasty traditional Italian dish. Desserts are amazing as well: Tiramis√É¬π and Limoncello Cake are definitely a must-try. Prices are very honest, considering the high quality of the ingredients

Limoncello is the best Italian restaurant in Singapore, and by this I mean that they have the most authentic ingredients and taste. Being Italian myself, I look for the quality of the food and not for fancy sophistication that has nothing to do with Italian cuisine.In particular, their pizza is the only one I found in Singapore to have true fresh Italian mozzarella, imported to Singapore daily by air transport. This makes a big difference. I understand that non-Italians, used to plastic style pizza, may not appreciate the authentic taste of real mozzarella, but that is the real thing, and it is delicious.Desserts are amazing as well, again with authentic and simple tastes, which is what Italian food is about. The owner is Italian as well as the chef, making this place really unique especially at these prices! They have nice al fresco seating, making Limoncello very nice for couples; in fact I went back at least 10 times with my girlfriend

it's a minute walk from home, however I only went there once, and I am never going back! the service was a disastrous experience, even by singapore standards: they could not find the reservation i made by phone the day before - the service was awfully slow - they messed up what we ordered - my main course came after my friend had finished his - the wine arrived with the check! - one of the waiter stepped away in the middle of the service to smoke like 10 meters away, under the glare of all the guests waiting for their meal. I felt relieved when I left this place. Terrible.A shame because the food quality was actually ok - but there is so much better in singapore..

Ordinary faux Italian food with incompetent service. Half way through eating our starters the waitress asked can I deliver your main courses now? Actually no, she seemed surprised. We then received 4 of our mains and waited another 20 minutes for the final main course and lastly we were overcharged on the bill. My advice don't bother.

My boyfriend and I are real Italian food lovers. We went to Limoncello after a friend warmly recommended it to us and we just loved the place ! Beautiful terrace overlooking the river, friendly and professional staff. The food was delicious though I was a bit disappointed they didn't have their Pasta della casa this night. It was a bit expensive but honeslty, it's worth the trouble. We will definitely go back

This is a nice place, a little out of the way in Robertson's Quay, further away from the main action. Nice big deck for the kids to run around on.I had the veal with risotto which was nice, my wife had the Ravioli which was excellent. The kids' pizzas were ok, but nothing special. Restaurants really should check if the intended recipient of a pizza is an adult or a kid, and dispense with the 'wacky' stuff for the kids (blue cheese, rocket/arugula etc).But all in all, a nice place
4
This place is alright for pastas (though not impressive), but their pizzas are a let down and so are their meats. The manager is very knowledgable about wines and can pick out the ones that you like - full marks for that. Bottomline: come here for the pastas and the wine. Skip the pizzas - you're better off at pepperoni's or something

well, it's not the first and it will be not the last time I go to Limoncello. I tried some other pizzas in robertson, but still i prefer this one. and it's not only my opinion. The italian pizza maker, the ingredients (really nice mozzarella) together with the pizza' dimensions (it's hard to eat all after a starter) make the general impression very good.Despite of some other reviews, the service it's always nice and available, at the end of the meal sometime they offer limoncello or digestive. If you have to wait for seating there is a bar area next to the main room. Maybe the main room would need some sort of "noise reduction" system because sometimes it's noisy. Not cheap but it's in line with the average prices, nothing expesive if compared with the service and, again, with the quality of the ingredientes
