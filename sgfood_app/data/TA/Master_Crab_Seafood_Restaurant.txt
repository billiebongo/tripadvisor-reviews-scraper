Many people patronise this outlet which is a franchise of the main store but it is not exactly too crowded. Food wise on par with the main branch but speed wise, I had mine ordered and served within 30 mins, so I am impressed.

My Wife and I went here to try the hot plate tofu and spicy chicken (although I yet to try their crab).We felt it was just mediocre, and perhaps we expected more since we had better hotplate elsewhere in Punggol. Will comment on the crab if we ever try it.

I like to call to take away dinners. Their business is good. So if u call earlier you need not wait that long. Like their Mee goreng and sinchow Mee hoon. Dry hor fun also nice! Fried rice has that wok hei taste! Their chefs quite good. Price average 4.5 onwards for take away. Else go there for Zhi char but always packed.

Master Crab has a branch in Punggol which not many customers may know.. Quality is as good as their other outlets because their seafood source is the same. The only negative side of the outlet is sitting is limited as it is located in a Kopitiam outlet
