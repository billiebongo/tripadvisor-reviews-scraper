We had a great time here. Huge 1 for 1 Asahi beer at happy hour from 6 to 8pm. The skewers were great. I loved the bacon wrapped asparagus, beef, air dried puffer fish, grilled squid. Really great service too! Will definitely be back.

The location is definitely a plus. My guests were very excited about the cathedral courtyard. Food and drinks are reasonably priced and tasty.

Very nice Izakaya at Chijmes. Prices about what you would expect in Singapore. Good appetizer menu. The service was excellent.

Was here with my buddy who recommended this awesome place. Service was excellent and there was also a beer promotion > 1 for 1! The food was very nice and fresh!

Visited this restaurant a few times over the years and the food is great (much of it made in nearby tatsu anyway. )The service tonight was terrible maybe if the wait staff spent as much time looking after all the other customers as they did on the table of eight men drinking copious amounts of sake it might have been better. Not just myself but other tables were having to wait and asked to be served It was happy hour and they didn’t even offer my two for one ..... very poor

We were meeting a friend for drinks and food and decided to go to Izakaya. We didn‘t regret our decision. The staff is very welcoming and friendly, the food was great and we had a great time. We ordered mixed sushi platters, some potatoe wedges and edamame - everythind was very yummy

Desperately looking for tasty food that was not too heavy as we've been in Europe for a few weeks.The welcome, service and ambience, with quiet background music, was perfect. My husband loved the happy hour (a free beer with a paid beer). Food was delicious. As an Australian, I can say the lamb chops and vegetables were exceptional. My husband says his mixed sausage meal was fantastic and the quality of the friendly service is unsurpassable.

This place is amazing! The ambience is great with good music, not too loud you can't engage in good conversation, but not too soft either. The food is wonderful - a consensus among many of my friends. The service is the best I've seen so far as well. I've been here a few times and every time the wind blows the napkin from the table down, the waitress will immediately replace it for you! :) lunch is great - the Dons are very value for money. Dinner is lovely - cheap drinks with good Yakitori & sushi
