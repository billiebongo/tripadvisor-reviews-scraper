Green tea soft serve was not very matcha-y and the staff was not skilled enough to make it a proper shape. Durian gelato was good though.

Loved the sesame and matcha cookie bits ice cream. It was so good I came back here twice on the same day!!

Decided to have some ice cream here after a short afternoon visit to Clark Quays. The very tasty ice-cream was overshadowed by very unfriendly staff who behaves as if we were a nuisance. Worst food experience for me in Singapore

The ice cream tasted ok but the staff was very unfriendly and not very flexible in taking orders. Mixing small portions of different tastes in small box not possible.

Right on Boat Quay outside the Clarke Quay Central mall.
There was a continual stream of customers - I enjoyed a two scoop cone - Lemon and Coffee - just right.
Enjoy a cone while you walk on the boardwalk.

Delicious Hokkaido ice-cream served in a cone in a unique fashion. The person will 'stretch' the ice-cream on top of the cone to form a pyramid shape. Be sure to eat it quickly before it melts in the Singapore heat!

Looked nice as ice cream in Hokkaido, Japan should be milky and tasty.Hokkaido is a big island of northern Japan having lots of milk cow farms.Mango ice cream was ok.But, vanilla...I expected thick texture, but it was too much of water...I hope it improves to keep up with the reputation of Hokkaido

My son's favourite ice cream place. He will always ask for Vanilla flavour, which I love too because of its rich creamy and milky taste. Other than Vanilla, Azabu Sabo has huge varieties of other flavours which customers will definitely be spoilt for choices. My usual choice will be Vanilla or Redbean.Price wise, it is quite reasonable due to the location.Single Cup: $4.20Single Cone: $4.9

This ice cream place was on my list for awhile. Yesterday I went for Ramen in the same shopping mall and had a chance to check it out. Mint Chocolate for single cup 4.20$ ice cream start melting right after I got it. The taste of mint was really weak. I was disappointed. Most of Japanese ice cream shop here I really like but not this one. Eatable but not enjoyable.

This outlet offers a range of ice-cream flavors at an affordable price. Some of the flavors are odd combinations such as maple and walnut or green tea ice-cream. As long as you choose a flavour that you like you will love this place I love chocolate so i chose milk chocolate flavour I was not disappointed
