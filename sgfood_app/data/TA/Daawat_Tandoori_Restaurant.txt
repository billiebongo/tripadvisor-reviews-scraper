Wonderful and authentic North Indian food. Its family run restaurant with great service. Highly recommend Panjabi samosa!

First time here. Politely asked questions about the menu and response was condescending...not ever
coming here again.

A repeat visit. Great butter chicken, fantastic prawn masala, a cauliflower dish (could have more cauliflower instead of potatoes) and delicious kashmiri naan. The kashmiri naan never failed to satisfy- lots of nuts and dried fruits in it. Spent abt sgd54 for 3 of us.

Stopped in for a quick lunch after an appointment nearby. I was the only customer in the place at 1400h. Friendly owner and waiter, the restaurant is pretty basic inside, no frills at all.....plastic tablecloth etc. The samosa was very good, the chicken karahi was extremely oily and rather bland, it definitely needed a bit of a kick. Pulao rice was ok. Overall for a cheap quick lunch or dinner it’s ok but it’s certainly nothing special.

FoodLoved the Aloo gobi and Palak paneer. Definitely a must try when visiting for the first time. Might be one of the best Aloo gobi I've had in Singapore. We also had garlic & butter naan. Loved the garlic naan. Another hit was a the mutton keema. Although we usually have it with chapati, it's a family favourite and we ordered it. Everyone loved it. It wasn't too oily and it was fragrant and tasty, not too overpowering for a mutton dish.The chicken tika masala & tandoori chicken were average though, definitely had better. Papadums were also really yummy, a hit with the kids especially.ServiceOur experience with service was good. We went as a large group; 14 of us. We kept ordering more and asking for papadum, and were served rather quickly. Waiters were also polite

Lunch with family who used to used to live nearby. Classic choices, classic good taste. We had a wide variety of naan , onion bahji, rogan josh, aloor mutter, masala tea. The masala was more bland than I like. The naan and mains were good. The kulfi , cardamom and pistachio ice cream was delicious

Visited this restaurant on 17.Jan.2017 for a late lunch at about 2 p.m. Ordered both the mutton set and the chicken marsala set. From a Chinese person's viewpoint, everything is great ... from the garlic and butter naan to the main course to the dessert, everything is just 'yummily' prepared and awesome in taste. The best is, all the food & beverage are consumed in an atmosphere of great ambience, coziness and tasteful decor. Plus the price is not prohibitive! The only thing I didn't quite like is the toilet as I feel that even though it is clean, it can certainly use a fresh coat of paint.The service is exceptional, especially when the owner is around. Overall for me, this is like a fine-dining restaurant with a 2-star price. Look forward to returning and ordering the mango lassi which is a 'must-try' if you dine here for the first time

Visited Daawat Tandoori Restaurant with some friends but none of us was really a fan of North Indian food... but after a meal here, we changed our mind towards North Indian food. We will return to the restaurant to try other north Indian dishes.Daawat Tandoori Restaurant offers a wide variety of delicious North Indian dishes.Try their naan that tastes so nice especially the paneer naan.The butter chicken & curry fish head with yoghurt are simply awesome.Don't forget to order the mango lassi which is so refreshing. Friendly waiters & waitresses always quick to serve you.

I love this place, the food, the simple decor, the friendly people and the regular customers... They all bring out the happiness in me. We tried almost all items in the menu and have not had any disappointment so far, and we had visited this place too many times. Love the paneer naan most, samosa and onion ring are good, the masala tea and mango lassi are awesome, dum biryani is good, kulfi as dessert is great... ALL IS GOOD! And their price is very reasonable....We brought friends and relatives here and they all love it too.This place is always full at dinner time, better make reservation..
