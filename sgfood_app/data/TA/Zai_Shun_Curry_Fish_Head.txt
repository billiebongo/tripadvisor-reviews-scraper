Zai Shun steamed fish always are the best in town. The stall are serving during till afternoon. The fried Qing long cai are very tasty and price are reasonable.

The steamed fish are the best in town and the prawn paste chicken wing and bitter gourd fried egg are very delicious..

A bit far from downtown, but it is one of the popular hawker stall places, a good place to see the local lifestyles. we tried steam fish head, can be customized in Curry, Teochow.... good for the family. Boss recommended bitter melon with salted eggs, also vey yummy,

Was here for lunch with my customers on their recommendation. Whole coffeeshop was owned by this stall. Very delicious steamed fish and their fried eggs with bitter gourd is highly recommended as well! Pig trotters was very nice too! Do try if you are around the area but please go early like 1130am for lunch. It will be full packed by 1230p

After winning the bib gourmand they got even more busy during lunch time. But quality of dishes and the skill of steaming the fish is still perfectly done! I hope they can still keep up with their food standard though the outlet is very crowded now

Come here for the steamed fish, my personal opinion...this is the "go-to" place for steamed fish..simply fresh and the steaming skill to perfection! Other recommended dishes: (1) braised pork knuckle, (2) stir fried bitter gourd with fresh and salted eggs, (3) braised 金针花（citron daylily), (4) steamed fish cake, (5) blanched 西洋菜 (watercress)...pair the dishes with rice or plain porridge.If still not enough, buy their sambal balachan which can be used as condiments at home.To avoid the queue, come before 11am

We drove more than 20kms just to visit this place in Jurong East. It isn't easy to find from the street as it is located within a compound of residential buildings. Place was almost full, probably from regular clientele. There are other stalls beside it but Zai Shun is clearly the main draw. Here are my recommendations:Curry fish head - contains lots of fish meat, sauce is actually soup which you can eat (or slurp) during the meal. Crispy chicken wings - this is coated with some seafood paste, giving it a distinct flavor. Kangkong - veggies to balance the meal.Overall, meal was very good. Wonderful first experience with fish head in curry. However, I find the place too far away from home, between 30-40 mins of driving.I intend to come back but not often maybe

2 of us decided to have lunch. Ordered salted egg bittergourd, hae bee hiam and shovel nose.Good was good but was disappointed that some of the dishes are 1 size (fit for 4 or more people).Bill came to almost $60 which was quite surprisingly expensive for 3 dishes. Won't be back soon.
5
Definitely a must go for fresh steamed fish! Super yum! And i love the ngoh hiang! For all fish lovers out there, this is the place to visit. However they are not open at night, only in the day.

You got to be prepared to wait for your dish. It's a worthwhile wait. It's good and fresh, you won't regret it.

Superb fresh steamed fish and once awhile you can get Empurau here. Empurau is the most expensive freshwater fish and easily cost $200/kg. Steamed Giant grouper is another highly recommended dish.

If you're going on weekdays , either you go early before 11am or after 1pm, otherwise the queue for table n food can be very long. Busy is brisk as usual when we arrived just after 1 pm . We ordered steamed fish , minced fried dry prawns , 青龙菜,... Delicious as always !

5mins for table (lucky), 10mins queuing, 10mins for small dishes to our table & 15mins for our fish head to be served.. Ultimately, Worth the wait! And definitely going back again for the super fresh fish, tasty handmade fish cake & bitter-gourd egg! So addictive, Yumz :

Tucked away in the heartlands, this is a rare gem. We came for dinner and it's set up differently from the lunch kitchen. With a much smaller menu concentrating on its specialty - fish. Choose from a wide variety that changes depending on its suppliers. There's 4 ways of preparing the fish; we chose the steamed with bean paste. Simply excellent. The other dish of bitter gourd was competent.
5
Their signature dishes are steam fish , fish maw,sea cucumber. Will suggest that you need to be there around 11.30am or else difficult to find a carpark lot!  A popular gathering of business bosses in Jurong! Recommend those who love good quality food with no air con in this run down kopi Tiam

We visited this well-recommended place at around 9am, and I was hesitant in ordering steamed fish so early in the morning. As it turned out, almost every table occupied had order one. We managed to get a table for 10 quickly, and we understand it gets crowded quickly. It was about 60% occupied then. We ordered quite a few side dishes. Worth mentioning are the sliced fish cakes and pork trotters, and of course the steamed fish. Available choices include the usual grouper, pomfret, wrasse, snapper, etc. The large fish we ordered was steamed perfectly and was deboned by us
5
Don't miss the big plate, fresh & good steam fish everybody is ordering. Try the big grouper tail, head, or fillet Hong Kong style or fermented soya or many other fresh fish choice.Besides for big group, there are many variety of other good food to enjoy

We had shark cartilage, steamed sea bass, pomfret. The quality that came out is restaurant standard and steaming hot. So fresh and thick. The fried bitter gourd with egg is out of the world but you realise the amount of lard which went in. Put your diet aside.The hei bi hiam and chai buay or salted veg as any Teochew knows is comfort food is cooked to perfection. So simple it's outstanding. Book in advance. Parking may be a problem. We were told that in the evening is a curry fish head stall. So come at 1030am to lunch time. At night it's operated by the brother
