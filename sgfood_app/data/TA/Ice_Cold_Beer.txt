This is a good drinking hole right at beautiful Emerald Hills. Good choice of beers and spirits. Nice interior. Attentive service. Cool place for a late beer.

Lively bar with good atmosphere, good location just off Orchard Rd on Emerald Hill and good happy hour until 21.00 (decent pint of London Pride for S$12).
However after happy hour, it is expensive so stock up before HH closes.
2
I thought $18 / £10 was a bit steep fo a pint of London Pride until I ordered a half of London Pride and got a bill for S$13 / £7.

It has been more than 10 years since my last visit, and It’s the same attractive as before. The chicken wing and pizza are really good while we enjoyed the little creatures pale ale....
It’s worth a return trip !

One of my favourite hang out place in orchard road.
Decent happy hour prices and I AM IN LOVE WITH THEIR CHICKEN WINGS AND HOTDOGS!
a fantastic place to eat dinner and a beer.

super good beer but gintonic is poor and has no gin. staff is ok, but not overwhelming. so its ok to sit out there for a view and the beer during happy hour that starts at 5PM
4
Yes the beer was cold..but...pop in here to snack on their chicken wings. This was a great treat to find.

I'm not a massive bar person but we visited with friends and decided to try some bar snacks - and I must admit I did enjoy the Spam fries! Guilty pleasure which I probably won't repeat but fun on holiday! They have a good selection of beers and drinks in general here and I guess it's a good pitstop if you're shopping on Orchard Road, it's also in a nice old fashioned part of the town with traditional buildings in this particular street

I’ve good memories of this place and went back today. Ordered a pint of beer with some chicken wings. My first sip of my beer was different from the usual. Usual of this place. Usual of everywhere. I couldn’t describe the taste. Stale beer? But my friend’s pint is not the same. So it’s the glass?It has this stale and faintly smelly sewage taste. I couldn’t ascertain it till I exchanged with my friend. We left the place then. Forget about the chicken wings too. It’s just ain’t the same.

Always great atmosphere, good choice of beer, great people around, perfect place for good time with friends in a really relaxed place.Chicken Wings are awesome, don't hesitate to ask for the spicy sauce too ! Would be perfect with some Blue Cheese Sauce, please add some :-)Great Pizza and Mini burgers to

The name carries the quality of the beers served, great games offered such as pool and speed beer opening competitions. Chicken wings are to die for!
4
They have different type of beer. I like their Hoegaarden. I love the way they decorate their bar counter where they put ice inside the glass counter.
5
I think this is so far the bar with largest beer options i have ever been to. Quite a good variety. Two floors here and pretty popular, both floors are packed with people.
2
By all accounts there's a worthy choice of beers which one would expect given the name!
Standoffish staff is a blemish unfortunately as well as the bog standard food on offer..
4
Followed my business friends to the pub and sat outside to enjoy the cool evening (it rained earlier). Great place with good service and no formalities. View was great as it's along Emerald Hill Road with the renovated historical shop lots.
3
Came here for beers after getting gouged at #5. Here it's only $25 net for 3 beers versus $19 for a single beer at #5, and they're really not too far apart. The beer, indeed, was ice cold. Good vibe inside and efficient service.
1
Defiant staff, offering me a complimentary drink to stop me from writing this post. Absolutely diluted!
Beware of Marilet!

A pretty place to hang out with sister! Came here many times till we refuse not to visit because of the ambience for relax and soccer!.. Friendly staffs too :)
2
This is a cool looking shophouse on charming Emerald Hill Road and is very inviting from the outside. Once inside it's dark and seems like a guys place with pin-up posters of women pasted all over the walls. The food was basic pub grub (nothing local) and marginal at best. They have plenty of beers to choose from so go to have a nice cold one and sit outside in front on their very inviting patio from which you can people watch.

I have visited this place several times. Being right in the middle of orchard rd (old conservation 2 storey shop houses), it is a popular place to hang out for drinks and food after work...Usually, the place is pretty packed, so do head down there early or make a reservation if possible. Prices of drinks and food are reasonable, but most importantly, the wide range of beers available is a big plus!For food, they have lots of choices e.g pizza, beef stew, buffalo wings which are all my fav there.Beef stew tops my list as it is really very very very good! The beef is cooked till soft and tender, sauce is rich and flavorful. It also comes with a few slices of bread which i usually will dip (more like soak actually) into the stew and finish off the meat last.Pizza crusts is thin and crispy and they are quite generous with the toppings.Buffalo wings are well marinated and fried to perfection. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.Entertainment wise they have a pool table upstairs and a dart board on 1st floor. They have both indoor & outdoor seats, but outdoor seats are quite limited
3
Nice atmosphere, lively music and a few "specials" for happy hour and bundles three for two and the likely. Bizarre on the bundles since it has to come all together otherwise you pay individual price. Food just ok.
5
Good ambience and good location for bonding with colleagues after office hours. It has some old look of pub and singapore
4
Great beer and good food too - I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and depth of the food menu. The bar has a good atmosphere and good for post work drinks, and also has pool tables and dart boards!
4
I went here with my husband for my birthday. We didn't feel like anything fancy, just a casual night out, which is what we got. We had the chicken wings and played some pool - chicken wings are as good as everyone says. The staff were friendly and the atmosphere nice and chilled. We'll definitely be back
5
It's loud. It's noisy. It's full of beer. Eh, must say some more meh? Lai lah, Lai lah! Mai tu liao! Every day got bottle beer deals on 2 for 15 nett, 3 for 20 like that. Shiokadoos!!!! Some more I kena the london Pride on tap I mabok already. The bar grub is power... Don't waste time planning for dinner elsewhere. You must kena the chicken wings and the salami and capers pizza. Confirm foodgasm one leiiiiii. My char bor also love.... Hooray! Shiokadoos man!!!!
4
Cool place to hang out with friends. People can play darts & pool while downing a few cold ones. This place is a little bit off the usual tourist spot places which is good in a way. Loved the Hoegaarden beer glasses (they have it on tap). Try their spareribs, it was the bomb
4
A favorite joint, always pretty busy, always a reasonable crowd. And it being in Emerald hill just off Orchard Road there a couple of options next door. Oh, and if you say the secret words "And a large Harricante please" then they take out the large African Parrot from beneath the bar who will pop your beer caps with its bea

A nice little bar tucked away...this is the last one in the line of Bars at Emerald Hill going away from Orchard Road. Has a great ambience to it, and the location is such that you would almost think you are far removed from the hustle and bustle of Orchard. 6 to 7 small outside tables, allow you to watch the world go by, and have a smoke if you need to.The Place has a ground floor, and another floor above. Pool table on the ground floor...weekends it gets pretty busy. Prices outside of the happy hour (which is until 9 pm) are not so great, so its recommended to get there early. Snack food type menu - chicken wings and Pizza options can be good.Ice Cold Beer does the music thing..and with the crowd plus the music, you will need to strain the vocal chords, and not good for the hard of hearing if you want conversation. Good mix of people there..not just a blokes pub. Worth a visit I would say..

Atmosphere was inviting, waiter instantly approached us when we entered in, quickly seated us and handed over menus. Great selections of Belgian best beers as well as with any other bottled beers. Chicken Wings is definitely worth to be said the best in Singapore! Ask for garlic dip to the waiter, it pairs perfectly. The fish and chips is also very nice. A very good place to wind down with friends for sure. Even if you just visiting the city, it's the best place to end the day after a long day roaming around the tropical weather
4
Great for chill-out after work on weekdays. Go for the happy hour deal on the drinks!! Was introduced to the fried chicken wings by a colleague, thumbs up! Shiok+++ to pair with ice cold beer. try out the pizza as well. A popular bar in Somerset. This place gets crowded easily. Do come by early to get a table
5
Been visiting this place for years! The best chicken wings in Singapore and fantastic crowd even on a Monday night. It is open pretty late and service is friendly. Prices are reasonable, overall a good combo.
4
Happy hour prices are good and the atmosphere is nice. Good place to go for a few well priced drinks before hitting other nightliife
5
Good bar, great happy hour from 5pm to 9pm each day. Lots of fun locals and expats, super friendly staff and awesome pizzas. A must do in Singapore.
5
Stumbled across this place whilst staying on Orchard Road and instantly liked it. Cold beer, good Happy Hour Prices and superb staff. Located up past a couple of other bars, this is less brash but more fun. Recommended.
5
A true Singaporean experience sitting out the front amongst the old shop houses - Orchard Rd seems miles away but is only 100m!! Inside the counters are loaded with bottled beer covered in ice - truly very cold beer. When paying Singapore beer prices why not make sure it is at its coldest it can be! These guys deliver in a fun and friendly environment
4
Been coming here for the past decade. Once a month at least to enjoy the best wings in Singapore. The burgers and pizza are awesome bar foods as well. Our comfort food. Beer prices are good, but not the cheapest HH around. But despite the bar name, we come here for the best bar food in SG
3
Visited this place with 3 of other friends yesterday July 17,2015. No. 5 were too busy and didn't any seat for us to sit down to hv a drink. So, we walk further to this place ordered 3 sapporo beers 3 bottles for 25$,glass of wine and perrier plus fish balls. All turn out just fine. Fish balls is tastes as the same as the one I normally bought from fair price (local supermarket in Singapore). At the end of the bar near restroom have 2 standard Dart boards for you to play.
4
We met with one of our Singaporean clients here and had a great time. We tried the pizza and the chicken legs, both very tasty and morish. The drinks were pretty expensive, but that seems to be the going thing in Singapore, so we just enjoyed the company and the atmosphere and enjoyed the visit. Staff were very good, prompt, friendly and the food service was fast. Located close to Dohby Ghaut MRT so easy access and there is a taxi rank next next door at the Centrepoint Shopping Centr

This is a good, casual bar after so many years. You just can't go wrong with coming here for a drink and simple bar food.The chicken wings are a must try! Never leave Ice cold Beers with trying the chicken wings!Pizzas are also good. It gets very crowded after 6pm
5
This bar is great and the atmosphere is really lively. The location is great and just off Orchard road. The beers come from every region so there is lots of choice and they do the usual happy hour offers. The wings here I would definitely recommend
4
A hidden treasure at orchard! You have to know where you are going. They have a lot of beers in bottles and London Pride on tap. Just take a stroll up Emerald Hill Road and you will find it !
5
traditional tropical.run more than 15years,I think.ever green,nice location,I love this place!
3
It's not a trendy bar but a pub.. reasonably priced snacks with good selection of beverages. well deserved to be a place to stop by !
2
The crowd at ICB is now ah beng central. Gone are the casuals. The music awful. Very loud dance music. This place used to play classics. Not now. The beer is warm and offers nothing you can't get cheaper at a supermarket. Saving grace is the chicken wings are still amazing
3
This is in a nice spot just off Orchard Road. We were meeting friends who were already sitting outside but when we pulled up seats from another table a waiter came out and told us we couldn't take up so much space so some of the party had to go inside. The waiter then stood over us whilst we chose drinks which we had to pay for immediately. At 10pm he came back out and told us we would have to either leave or go inside. A poor experience, which is a shame as it's a nice bar
3
I am not really sure how to define a good bar. It is not that crowded on a Thursday night. We had the famous chicken wing and pizza. Tastes quite good especially the chicken wings. Probably one of the best I had in Singapore. A good place for business gathering even with friends
5
Brought my overseas friends here for a few beers. The is fantastic and all my friends love the place very much. We have a few beers and the crowd is just keep coming in. I will definitely recommend this place if you have not been here before
3
Overall beer price is OK and service in the typical Singapore fashion - average to not so good lah. Warning: if you order beer bottles on promo make sure you drink them all at once since they do not provide ice buckets to keep the rest of beers cold...So weird
4
Nice place to hang out with a bunch of friends . Beer is cheap . For those beer lover sure will love this place . They also have a lot of choices for cider as well . Sure I'll return . The only thing is for me more to a pub than a bar ....
3
First time to try spam fries and i got addicted to it! Their chicken wings is also great! I will never forget how one pint (500ml) of Hoegaarden draft is 20SGD! Wouch! It was busy when we went..on a thursday night but we still got a table
4
Just off orchard road - great place for Beer and Wings - where the local execs hang out for a beer after work - just good pub culture ! and great beers !
4
If you are looking for a casual place for a good beer selection and some comfort food, this is the place. Just off Orchard Rd its a good escape in a cool atmosphere, one of the better beer selections in the area.
4
Always good beer with reasonable good food. Never failed to satisfy me for the last 6 years. Their Chicken Wing is very nice.. Leffe is awesome.. Strongly recommended. Will I go back? Yes like always.
4
Met some expat friends from Singapore and had a great evening. Happy Hour price are good and the pizzas are the best in town. We drunk too much and had a good time. But I guess that's what you want in a bar
2
I've lived in Simgapore for 10 years and used to go to ICB weekly. Now most locals avoid it. There's plenty of other good bars in Orchard. On our most recent visit Yeo Hui Ying was our server and was slow, incompetent and rude.
3
Nothing to write home about, but it does the job. Not that large of a beer selection, but it covered the basics. If you are in the area, it's worth checking out but I feel like it was more of a "see and be seen" place instead of a bar where people go for good beer.I went on a Thursday and it was packed

The last time I visited Ice Cold Beer was at least 4 years back, just once. Not a usual fan of drinking beer, but tonight I decided to chill out here with some new friends.The interior is dim but bustling with happy crowds indulging in their light bar snacks and over 60 types of bottled and draft beers. The beers were served icy-cold from unique ice tanks. Music was a tad loud, but that was the purpose of bars / pubs right? So that people could lose themselves in the music and drink, and not having to talk much to each other maybe.We were a large group and had our cozy corner on level 2 - converted into Stellar Bar - a showcase bar complete with warm earth tones, soft lightings, long bar counter and large mirrors. We were seated on comfortable black couches while some of us took turns at the pool tables or mingled over drinks and nibbles.The Chicken Wings (SGD $18.00 for a dozen) were what I heard people talk about constantly - we had a few baskets of that, taking turns to order and contribute. The skin was crispy, and the chicken was well-marinated so it tasted delicious.Next, the Top Shell (SGD $16.00) - rather succulent and chewy textFinally, the Fish Balls - big in size and rather crispy skin, served with slices of cucumber - another nice snacker to pair with drinks.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/06/chilling-out-at-ice-cold-beer.htm

Nice place in a quaint location, however very crowded so getting a table was a mess. They have a couple of pool tables which were nice - but again hard to get a game as there were many people. Beer was good, but a little pricey. Overall an average place
5
Ice Cold Beer is situated in one of the most beautiful roads in Singapore. Take a little time to go back in the day to explore the wonderful Chinese Shop Houses on Emerald Hill.Back to the review...Ice Cold Beer is a real find. It is renowned for providing its namesake, and has an ice filled glass bar, just to make sure its wares are to the correct temperature! Bar snacks here are fantastic. I believe it is renowned for hot dogs, but we didn't venture further than the Chicken Wings, which are the best I have ever sampled! Hot, crispy and absolutely delicious! The bar has quite a high number of regular ex-pats and there are even a couple of dart boards and streamed football to keep people happy. Staff are very efficient (even when the bar is heaving) and freindly.A great experience and we will (without doubt) be back

Ice Cold Beer, thats also the name of the bar, great place to down a beer with friends,its conveniently located right in the heart of Orchard Road, though its always crowded.
