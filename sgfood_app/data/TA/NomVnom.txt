Had lion mane burger set meal with truffle fries and fresh lemon passion fruit tea. For the first time, do not feel guilty eating fast food as is not junk food. Yeah!!

Amazing how good these burgers are. Really tasty and moist, the bun is really soft but still toast on the inside. I like them more than the meat burger!

Huge menu and something for everyone. Unfortunately there was 8 of us and this seemed to throw the kitchen into chaos. Vegan members of our party were very happy coming across this hidden gem.

it is juicy and yummy burger. It can come with a set meal with drink and side dishes. The food is served fresh and delicious.
5
The food options are a lot. Great vegan options and still healthy. The food pricing is worth the food . The staff are friendly too.

Great-tasting vegan-friendly food in a equally awesome location that is The Central at Clark Quay. You'll never imagine crispy burger patties made out of different kinds of vegetables. The pasta taste great as well. Absolutely love the Sweet Potato fries.

I would agree with everyone here who's had positive things to say about the food. As a veggie Singaporean, I love supporting local veggie businesses like this.I visit the Clarke Quay often (maybe 1 - 2 times per month in the past year) either alone or with different friends for lunch or dinner. I have some regular favourites from the menu (eg: carb-free Bonsai Burger, Tempeh Burger, QQ Cheesy etc), & have not managed to work my way through all the choices.However, most times when I order from the cashier, I would be greeted with a glum face instead of a smile or hello. I really don't know why. As a matter of practice, I always greet serving staff with a "Hello, may I have a....". On my most recent visit (at 11am on a weekday, 1hr after the advertised opening time), this happened:Me: Good morning! (pause)Staff taking order: Yes?Me: May I have a ____ tea please? Staff: We don't have ____ tea. (pause)After I sat down with a different cuppa ___ tea, I decided that enough is enough. When my friend arrived, I finished my tea told my friend about the poor attitude and we went somewhere else. I will not be returning again. Much as I want to support a local veggie restaurant, I also don't think they need me to support taking their customers for granted in this way. Not cool

Words can't describe the joy while having dinner at Nomvnom. I had tears in my eyes. I have never eaten such a delicious plant-based burger in my life before. One of my favorites is the Temptation Satay Burger. The burger is made from all-natural ingredient, and it is soft, tasty and freshly packed with veggies that will leave you craving for more. All combo set meals are also paired with a small glass of lovely vinegar drink to be consumed prior to eating the burger.The amazing thing about Nomvnom is the wide variety of burgers available for selection, and you would definitely find one of the burgers you like on the menu. Some of my favorite sides are Goro Balls, Golden Rings, Mushroom Fritters, Vietnam Yam Rolls & Yam Fries + date dip. I personally like the fresh lemon passion fruit tea and avocado smoothie to go along with my combo meals, but you could also opt for the hot drinks at the same time.It's really one of the most creative plant-based and guilt-free fast food restaurant that you can find in South East Asia, and it's right here in Singapore! This is definitely not the usual burger joint that you can find in Singapore. I will be eager to come back for more, and try all the burgers they have on the menu! Keep it up, Nomvnom! You're the Best :

In the food court, so can be busy at times. There’s a pretty extensive selection. I went for one of their top selling burgers and purple potato fries. Unlike other reviewers mentioned, ketchup and other condiments were freely available in the side. I enjoyed my meal although I could not quite figure out what the pattie was made of so wouldn’t choose that particular one again.Not bad if you want some fast ‘junk’ food

Their burgers are even better than those non-vegan burgers. Wide range of burgers to choose from at affordable prices. Best of all,they care for our well-being.. there's a small glass of cider vinegar on the side which we were told to drink it before eating our burger so as to help aid digestion. Ain't that awesome. A must try...'Jacky' Burger. Surprisingly good and unusual
5
I tried the Central Clark Quay location. Not much ambiance, but great food. If you are vegan and want a burger, this is the place for you. They have fried and non-fried options. I also enjoyed the dessert.
5
Plenty of vegan burger options, but gluten-free veg's don't despair -- the bunless Bonsai is there for you (and great value for money). Worth the trip into Clarke Quay Central's lower-level food court.
5
Very unique burger restaurant, they have several types of vegetarian burgers, salad, and some interesting fruit drinks. Nice and neat!

Went to have lunch there. Although the staff were friendly and helpful, the food quality was sub par and tad bit expensive. The customer base was mostly young student travellers and I felt that charging 6 Singapore dollars for a smoothie was very expensive. I had the dal Fusion burger although it tasted good but I believe I could have had a better meal elsewhere. Plenty of choice if you are a vegan/vegetarian and struggling to find food in Singapore.

I’m here again because someone has been telling me how delectable the burgers are. Plus, it’s a guilt-free fare. And diner is spoilt or choice from the wide array of burgers, with at least 16 creative burgers on the menu. Randomly, I order nomvnom burger @ $6.9. That’s just SUPER! Gourmet Burger. The burger comes with bun made from all-natural ingredients, is soft, tasty and fresh. Packed with fresh veggies. Patties is of high quality and crispy. This burger is paired with a small glass of lovely vinegar drink to be consumed prior to eating the burger. Innovative! A great place for tourist who wanted to taste burger with a local fusion twist. Also a guaranteed eatery that keep food lovers and hip youngster happy

On holiday in Singapore I came across nomVnom in the basement of Central Clarke Quay. Being a vegan it was great to find a burger joint that has numerous options and all are vegan, I tried 7 different burgers during my stay all delicious. Even my husband who is a meat eater also loved the burgers

I can't say enough how much we enjoyed the food at nomVnom! We ordered 2 "meals" as they give a couple of dollars off when you order 1 burger, 1 side and 1 drink together. We ordered:1 Nom Nom burger, 1 QQ Cheesy burger, 1 mushroom fritter side, 1 chocolate muffin, 1 fresh carrot juice and 1 cinnamon cocoa. (All sharing between 2 people as we wanted to try them all)They also gave us free vinegar-y palate cleanser shots with the food- delicious and a nice touch. I can't decide which burger I preferred! The cheesy sauce was nutty and tasty and the tartare sauce on the Nom Nom was fresh and delicious. Both burgers had soft real bread buns and weren't dry at all (some burger places don't give enough sauce). The mushroom fritters were pretty great, although breaded, not battered like on the menu photo. Juice was so good and the cocoa was amazing- rich and not too sweet. The star of the show had to be the cakes! The chocolate muffin was WARM! Light, fluffy and chocolately, I could not get enough. So after we ate we bought another one to take away plus a slice of the banana bread (equally delicious and freshly-baked tasting). Nice atmosphere and quick to get to from the local Clarke Quay MRT. It wasn't busy when we went but I hope if it is next time that they have enough cakes for everyone (we only saw 2 left after we bought our 3). My only complaint is that is wasn't close enough to our hotel (in Bugis) so we couldn't make it there more than once. Please consider opening more branches (one in the airport would be the best!!). Lovely, friendly service from the woman there, who kindly described and recommended burgers to us. Food came after 5ish minutes (but we were the only diners at the time).

I bumped into this place while I was wandering around Singapore late at night trying to find some sort of filling vegan meal to consume. This place is a bit pricey, with burgers costing $6-15, but a yummy side salad came with mine and there is a wide variety of vegan burgers to choose from. The passion fruit juice was very tasty as well! It advertises itself as a fast food place, but it also has a nice dining area to eat in as well

This place was close to my hotel so I decided to give it a try as I'm vegan and after researching a few places nomVnom had great reviews. The staff get five stars, they are so lovely and friendly and make coming here worth it. The sweet potato fries were delicious and the beetroot burger I had was good, though a little on the mushy side for my own preference. I asked for it without the bun and they kindly put it in a lettuce wrap for me instead. Good food on the go

Went there for an earlier Christmas during year end period, the food is nice. The price range is ok.The only not so part is they mess up the combo combination, where they mix up my girlfriend burger with my drink and vise versa. This is the part where I gave overall 4 star
5
Vegan fast food in Clarke! The burgers are delicious. Tried both Nom Nom and QQ Cheezy and they did not disappoint. Same can be said for the sweet potato and Japanese potato fries. Love this place and will definitely come back here.

The vegan hamburgers are amazing, maybe the place is not that good because is inside a mall, and I really think this place deserve more and a better location, because I was very impressed with the food.

We stumbled upon nomVnom in basement of Clarke Quay building, knew it was vegan fast food (burgers mostly) from doing our pre-trip research for vegetarian/vegan Singapore restaurants. Decided to give it a try, but the burger we had (the one that included beetroot) was so so and the fries tasted a bit strange (not what we're used to). Have eaten much better vegetarian burgers elsewhere, so would not return. We ate at several other Singapore restaurants (some multiple times during our 2 week stay), and this is the only one not worth writing home about, unfortunately. Good on them for trying - offering all-vegan burgers (it is not obvious though, that the food is vegan, we only knew from previous research), but flavour / quality needs to be improved

Read their story first. Saw the ad online and here I am sinking my teeth into this succulent burger. The patty tastes so good! The truffle mushroom soup and the fries add a good side kick to the burger mania. Tried the local flavour temptation satay and qq cheesy burger. Both five stars! Vegans if u are in clarquay drop by this hidden gem. U ll love the flavours and textures. Nom Nom.
5
This place is in the basement of the building, so it took me a bit of time to find it.My burger and fries were great, and very nicely presented. I had the Vila flora burger which was very nice and had 2 potato patties rather than buns.The price was reasonable and the staff were very nice and helpful.

So much choice food-wise in singapore.Why not go for something different?Quirky little place in the basement of Clarke Central mall.Helpful staff,very interesting menu.Delicious,fresh pattie and salad,soft toasted bread bap, tasty fries on the side..lots of options ...I didn't really know what to expect but was very impressed.So much choice. Very interesing and enjoyable visit

My second visit at this joint and it was amazing. I tried the Beetroot Hummus and Umi Teriyaki burger so far and they were both delicioso! The beetroot hummus was the best burger I have ever had. It really exudes the mediterranean feels. The umi teriyaki was super juicy so do keep your tissues out for all the sauce thats gonna be dripping down your hands after the first bite. Servive is pretty quick, upholding its status as Vegan fast food. The place is really nice and with really good seating. Thumbs up for awesome food and good service. Definitely going back again!
5
This place was a lucky find, but I'm glad I found it! The burger was so delicious and the house iced tea along with the fries just completed the meal perfectly. It's a great stop as you're passing through from the MRT to the mall above at Clark Quay! I am always excited when I can find good vegan food away from home! There are so many burgers to choose from and the whole menu is vegan! If time allowed, and it weren't so far from where I was staying, I would have gone back a second and third time! Great vegan fast food!!
5
The burgers were amazing, had the chips with the date dip as wel, it just keeps you coming back for more. I highly recommend you to go back for a dessert as wel, been here a couple of times now and it's seriously unbelievable. The chocolate muffins are to die for, oh and the banana bread yammie! Try out there recommended drinks, they're pretty amazing to. I really like this place, the service is also really friendly

It is hard to find vegan places and harder to find good vegan places. The burger was excellent (I got a cheesy mushroom stem burger). I got a combo of 2 types of sweet potatoes. The orange colored one was very good but the yellow one was very dry so don't order that one. Price was reasonable
