The food, ambience and service was excellent. Even though I used the Chope system to make my reservation, the restaurant did not receive my reservation. This was not the restaurant's fault.

This place is fantastic
Great bar area to start the evening offering all sorts of drinks. They offer speciality gin and tonics, which are delicious.
The restaurant is very Thai in style and the food amazing. Very courteous staff. Highly recommended.
5
Was completely surprised that a gem like this was in the neighbourhood. Classic beauty and understand why this is a heritage building. Would be great for private functions and the food is very satisfying too

Been there a few times for dinner and most recently for the Sunday brunch. The black and White House in the lush environment is really nice and peaceful (on the terrace...it can be quite noisy inside), and the food is really good. It is therefore really unfortunate that the service is quite poor (in general and in particular given SIngapore standards): hard to get a smile from anyone nor real attention. We were left waiting for 30+ minutes for a fruit platter... When we said we give up and asked for the check, well, no apologies and certainly no rebate (desert was part of the $60 brunch menu). Too bad, I don’t think we’ll go back and can’t recommend the experience

Amazing birthday celebration! We arrived early and sat in the lounge and had a couple of gins. Their infused gin is unique and delicious, with many flavors to choose from. The black and white house has a very interesting history, ask to speak to Mama Helen and she will give you a detailed history of the property from a personal perspective. We had the poached prawns wrapped in smoked salmon, Burmese-style beef, minced chicken with basil, and stir-fried broccoli with rice. Everything was delicious. All food is served together in traditional Thai style. If you ask, or order staggered you will get things in a more western order; starter then main. I can not thank the staff enough for making my birthday (Big FIVE - ZERO) special and memorable. The prices are reasonable for Singapore and you can not beat the venue or service. We will be back
5
A must to visit in Singapore and please reserve! During the weekends might be occupied with weddings, etc. For drinks - reserve the table at the bar (beautiful room with candlelights). For the dinner I would go for a terrace - beautiful space in nature. Great customer service and the atmosphere!

The location is very nice while food is just okay. Most annoying is, they are very secretive with their menu and prices ( which are all around $20) and when i asked they said that this is their policy and the only thing they could share was the Christmas menu (served from the 1st of December). When we went for dinner and asked for the Christmas menu, nobody had a clue!

4 of us have dinner there. We are looking for something romantic and authentic. Tamarind Hill has what we are looking for. It fits into our requirement.A nice romantic place for a quiet dinner. Good food and ambience. Service is good too. Very nice authentic Thai Food topping up with fantastic dessert
4
We went to Tamarind hill as a group of 4. On arriving you are confronted with a stunning villa like setting. This would be a great place to impress out of town friends or a new date - simply lovely surroundings. We arrived at the mainly "foreigner" filled venue and sat at the bar. The non alcoholic cocktails were good, the alcoholic were maybe a little less attentive. My first negroni had to be sent back due to the addition of sparkling water, a subsequent correct negroni and a whisky sour were ok, but not great. In fairness the venue addressed the issue with the first drink quickly and efficiently, so I won't hold this against them. Sitting down to dinner everything on the extensive menu sounded great. Prices were a bit high, but I felt very reasonably given the venue. When the food came we all loved every dish. I would say this errs on the side of very good westernised thai food rather than authentic Thai, but this should not be held against it - it was delicious food in a great setting. I would happily go back, probably not for a weeknight meal but any sort of special occasion or group gathering would be suited. I hope they can up the game on the bar just a little bit - at the end of the day this is an "Atas" venue
4
There is almost nothing I can fault with our evening here. Service staff were friendly and attentive. Food was super yummy. Atmosphere was so laid back yet cozy at the same time.Thanks to Mama Rose and Helen for the lovely chat too! They made me feel so at home. Love goes to Tamarind Hill!
4
We went there for Sunday brunch with free flow of items from a menu. Portions were large, and great quality food with good service.
Cocktails though were way too sweet, they really made a mess even of the simple classics like Old Fashioned...
5
If you would like to go somewhere nice. this is the place. Only downside, it might get a tad cold inside because the Air-Con is set very high.
Food is just perfect and the staff is very friendly.
Perfect place for an romantic dinner.
5
Lovely food and cocktails and staff very attentive and knowledgeable. A very special thanks to the lady behind the bar (previously from Scotland) who as well as being very knowledgeable and helpful also shared her secret with me regarding keeping mozzies at bay.
4
An extremely spacious restaurant where your table is far away from other fellow diners making it ideal for those who want privacy and space! Good food. Fantastic service.
5
Enjoyed Sunday brunch on the veranda of the former British officer's club which is now a restaurant. Located in Labrador Hills, a historic park overlooking the ocean, this Thai-style restaurant offers an unlimited number of dishes off its menu. Items are small - designed for one or two people - but you can have as many as you want. We had a massaman curry, rice, fried pork, fish, fish cakes, accompanied with a bottle of red wine from South Africa. Very good food. We ended with a dessert of sticky rice and mango. Service is prompt, the food is great, and the veranda offers nice breezes and a view. You can also en- in air conditioned comfort inside the tastefully decorated restaurant

First thing first. This place has an awesome ambiance! It is absolutely delightful to look at and probably one of the best places to have a quiet dinner with a fine dining feel.However, we didn't have a great experience as first timers, and my friends who were quite regular at this place were highly disappointed with the food and service.The food was just average. The only standout was the tom yum soup which was the best I have had in Singapore so far.The staff was so callous, not at all attentive. We had to wait for so long to catch their attention and it doesn't make sense if the restaurant is almost empty! They even managed to make mistakes with our drinks. One of the servers was whistling while serving us food. Not expected from a fine dining restaurant.Would I give it another chance? Probably yes just because of the ambiance and hoping that the service was just a one-off and they are usually not so careless. There are other things on the menu I would like to try out
4
The restaurant is in a very old historical building, with whitewashed walls and lots of lovely dark wood. There is a large welcoming bar and several rooms and alcoves. However, there is never a "closed in" feeling. All the areas are open to the next area. There is also extensive outdoor dining. While I have found service overall to be excellent in South Asia, I was particularly impressed here that they tailored the service to our desires. We like to have a cocktail before ordering, and they were very good about not rushing us. The food is authentic regional cuisine, and ours was very good
4
This is a Thai restaurant that will really impress your friends. It is situated in an old restored bungalow. The ambiance is amazing. It feels like going back in time. It is a feast for the eyes. Parking is available at the back of the restaurant.Service was excellent and the food was great. The papaya salad is a little too spicy for me but I am sure it will nice for people who like spicy food. The fish cake was tender and delicious. The fried egg plant was not too oily . The fried pandan leave chicken was also tender and just the right size. The fried prawns were crispy on the outside but soft inside, There were very fresh, The mango sticky rice dessert was as good as those in ThailandReally like this place as it is simply a joy absorbing the nice ambiance while dining the great food
5
We took some friends visiting us to this restaurant for dinner - it's set in an old black and white house in Labrador Park (a large and beautiful nature reserve) this has quickly become one of our favorite restaurants in Singapore.There is a nice, quiet bar on arrival where they serve various infused gins with Fever Tree tonic water (a winner for me) - the bar staff are great. We moved into the dining area, you can sit inside or outside on a deck overlooking the gardens. The food is incredible, mix of Thai and Malaysian dishes on the menu - my husband had the Lamb shank rendang which was incredible and definitely worth a try. Great wine selection too..Can't wait to go back again soon, everyone should try this place
5
I had a group of friends over for dinner at Villa Samadhi with food served by Tamarind Hills. The food was fantastically delicious and they were not overly spicy so my friends who can't take spicy food were able to enjoy the meal. Service was very prompt and attentive and i should have tipped the waiter but I was too distracted sending my friends off after the dinner. I will definitely return to dine at Tamarind Hills again.
5
We visited this restaurant to celebrate shedding anniversary and loved the colonial period building and the food lived up to the recommendation we had been given. We will certainly return for a further meal on our next visit to Singapore.
5
Have came to Singapore quite number of times but this restaurant setting is quite unique and relaxing. The Thai foods we ordered are good and well served by attentive staffs.
5
We enjoyed a wonderful meal.
Staff very attentive, good wine and very very good food.
Enjoy cocktails in the great hall, then eat out on the beautiful verandah looking at the stars
4
A very beautiful place, far from the crowd. I have been there a few times. Food is so so in my opinion.
2
I was looking for a place to enjoy a Friday afternoon lunch outside with a friend. I called for a reservation. Despite all the tables outside being fully set up, when we arrived, we told told there is no outside seating at lunch. I inquired with a staff member who was not very polite several times about seating outside, and told no. When I told them we were leaving as we desired to sit outside, she then appeared to care and mumbled about asking a manager. No one returned promptly and left a few minutes later. To boot, the table cloth was stained in several places and the table was highly unstable with the same staff member trying to shimmy paper under the feet
5
We were pleased to enjoy a wonderful dinner at Tamarind Hill while staying the Villa Samadhi.The menu comprises many different Asian cuisines -- Malay, Thai, Burmese, and Chinese -- all with the chef's interpretation. We started with a Laotian larb, scallops, and steamed fish with Jasmine rice. The portion sizes are quite large and this was easily more than enough for the two of us.The ambience -- a restored 19th century warehouse building with wide verandahs and wooden floors -- is very pleasant, and the staff friendly and very helpful in explaining the menus.Highly recommended, and we'll return
5
Colonial mansion turned restaurant atop Labrador Nature Reserve, Tamarind Hill was perfect in every way. With great service, absolutely fabulous food (the steamed sea bass was to die for) and even a little surprise dessert for our wedding anniversary at the end (their rightly famous pink diamond) we had an unforgettable evening there and will definitely be going back.
4
Proper welcome when we showed up at the entrance.Large selection of beverages at the (splendid) bar where it's great to chill out in.We decided to have our dinner outside on the large wooden terrace. No mosquitoes spotted and didn't feel hot at all thanks to the fans. Ceiling fans would be better though, quieter and nicer than the wall-mounted ones.The dishes we ordered were served quickly and All of them were excellent, and portions bigger than I expected. Indeed the recommended massaman curry was exquisite.Our young waitress was available, polite and helpful. However I couldn't help being distracted by the other 2 always chatting and giggling (not so professional although there were only 2 tables with guests).Overall it was still a pleasant dinner, price in line with expectations

- Food: fine Thai dishes but no originality in flavors nor in display. Portions are also very small. The papaya salad was very good though.- Value: poor value because prices are very high for small portions. Example $38++ for 4 little river prawns. On top you have to buy rice extra :-(Duo of Thai dessert was the only good surprise in terms of quality, originality and quantity.- Service: very average. Poor English and very limited knowledge about the menu and the ingredients. But nice waitress : quiet and efficient.- Atmosphere: very charming ambiance especially at night (lush surroundings lit up by candles). Inside is freezing cold with aircon set on 16degrees!! but the settings is thai minimalist/chic. We sat outside (prefer the left hand section of the terrace, more intimate and nicer view). Be ready for mosquitoes also. We got bitten so many times by mosquitoes than we had to leave earlier than planned.
2
A couple of hiccups during our experience here. The SautÃ©ed Beef came with all asparagus, no beef. Waitress said she'd order another one for us, but it never came. We had to order the Stir Fried Assorted Mushrooms with Sweet Basil twice. The entire appetiser menu was nowhere to be found? Even though we were told we should help ourselves to the appetisers & pad thai from the outdoor stations ourselves. (The only outdoor station there was for Pad Thai, salads, beef noodles & meat skewers.) We also waited 20 mins for our 2nd round of dessert; only after we enquired about it did the 2 desserts arrive. Something is wrong somewhere in the supply chain if the restaurant cannot deliver timely & adequately even when the restaurant is not completely full!Oh, & we were all quite thirsty after our meal I'll be honest, I was only here because I won a contest & the prize was the Thaim-less brunch for 3 pax. Thankful that I won, but no I won't be back.Truthfully, the food isn't bad, although I am not sure how authentic it is. But $60++ per pax is STEEP, & the food wasn't amazing nor was the variety astounding. & this is at a pretty inaccessible (though rustic & is lovely in that sense) location. Maybe the a la carte menu would give you better value for money
5
I was hosting a guest of 10. Everyone totally enjoy it. Excellence Ambience, good food and friendly staff. One thing to improve is that there is no shelter, hence it will be inconvenience during raining and without umbrella. This location is accessible by car only.
5
even if you're not staying at the Villa it's worth the visit for great food and cocktails in a luxury setting.
4
The location is special. Very atmospheric. Interior was lovely, as was the food. Exquisite taste and presentation, but be prepared to splurge.
5
OMG if you are visiting Singapore this restaurant is a must! It gives you the feeling like you have stepped back to the colonial days. You wouldn't even think you were in Singapore! Food and cocktails were amazing would definitely come back again!
5
My parents went for Mother's Day buffet lunch and the hospitality was amazing! They loved the food and the atmosphere so much that they took a 2 minute video and sent it to me.. Thanks for the awesome service!
4
It's a little bit of a drive out of the CBD and our Uber driver struggled at first to find the restaurant. We sat outside and it did feel a little like we had travelled back in time to a more relaxed world. The food was good without being great. The service was attentive. I didn't pick up the bill so not sure how expensive it was but I suspect "very". Curries were all good
5
We've been to Tamarind Hill a few times now and have never been disappointed. The restaurant itself is a beautiful setting, a colonial style building hidden within Labrador Park. The interior is spacious and the tables are far enough apart such that you can have your peace and quiet. It is a comfortable noise level, not so silent it is uncomfortable but plenty quiet enough to have a conversation.The food is upscale Thai, you won't find your Pad Thai and Fried Rice on the menu, but the Massaman curry is excellent. The menu is extensive with a number of appetizers, soups, every type of meat, vegetarian options and desserts. Even the pickiest eaters should be able to find something delicious they want to eat. The dishes are great for sharing, one main is generally enough for 1.5 people. Also, make sure you ask for their gin and tonic menu! They have a great selection of gins and various garnishes to personalize it to your taste.
5
We had a fantastic weekend lunch . We thought we would go for brunch, but that is only on Sunday's. So Saturday is just a la card Thai menu. We had the appetizer platter, duck salad, red Tom yam soup, green curry and fried fish. All was delicious. The lemon grass juice was delightful
5
A party of six, including two very well-behaved 9 year olds, had a truly lovely experience. Welcomed by a charming and enthusiastic staff, we discovered treasures in the wine list. Old Bas---d shiraz by Kaesler - spectacular! And went well with a varied Thai menu. The staff were vary attentive to the two children and went out of their way to make us feel as if we were dining in someone's home. Speaking of which, the restaurant was once a home - it's dramatic and attractive
4
The Mother's Day brunch offering was a wide selection and had plenty of the standard Thai favourites including pad Thai, multiple, salads, curries and soups. The dessert fare could have been a little more wider and refilled faster. One of the chefs was Super helpful and attentive. The same cannot be said of the wait staff who did not look pleased to be there and gave mixed messages. This is the second time I was here and both times I was told the bar tender was on leave and so they couldn't do drinks and then later I saw other patrons being served drinks. When I asked I was told they were doing some drinks but not all. The restaurant itself is in beautiful Labrador Park and offers a break from the crazy busy restaurants in the city.
5
During my stay in the Villa samadhi i could try this restaurant but only for the breakfast because they work together for the breakfast And I could appreciate the tranquility of the place
5
Set in a heritage building building in a forest. Very unique environment. Very high quality service. Plenty of space between the tables. Delicious food.
5
Quality of food was excellent and staff were very helpful, particularly as we were unfamiliar with some of the food on the menu. Had two very enjoyable meals here.
2
Great service but food is not up to standard. Curry dishes still has strong coconut milk after taste. Laab Gai was very water and taste sweet instead of sour. Fish cake was very bland. Compare to the price, it is not worth the money.
5
If you are a looking for a place that takes you out of Singapore, this is the restaurant for you. The food was divine, the cocktails delicious and the service staff excellent. Try the different cocktails as they had a different one for different palates - soothing to spicy. The duck salad was my favourite so don't miss it. Great for a romantic or just a relaxed night out with a group of good friends
4
This beautiful restaurant is located within the 22-hectare Labrador Nature Reserve, and as such is surrounded by lush green. The old colonial building has been lovingly refurbished and it's worth a visit even if only for a drink as the location is so pretty. Cocktails are good, and so is the food. We started at the bar and had a great conversation with the very amicable staff. Later we moved out onto the terrace for dinner. It's nice to experience both settings
5
I begin my dinner with a lemongrass lychee cocktail served in a bamboo container! Every bite of tiger prawns is full of the most amazing flavors. I also enjoy a clear Tom Yam soup with generous pieces of seafood, the platter of various appetizers, beef curry, pink diamond dessert served in a coconut bowl. The service was great and attentive. I feel like a royal princess .. the grand old bungalow and the long staircase lit with candles.
2
The venue has the atmosphere of a dining hall. The service was mixed. The food was weak. We had three entrees: satay chicken skewers were boring; foie gras was served cold and was somehow wrong; the mixed platter was ordinary. The massaman was fair. The tom yum soup was pretty good. The drinks were awful. My champagne was flat. I sent it back. Next, the Chardonnay was flavourless. I sent it back. We ordered a full bottle to get something fresh. Much better. At the end we were charged for, and paid for, the lot. I did not want to make a fuss on our anniversary night. About 15m after we left three of the staff rang our bell (we were staying at the attached hotel Villa Samadhi) to bring us a cake for our celebration. A nice sentiment but given they forgot at our dinner they should not have rung our room bell at 10pm to catch up. A comical experience - but not funny at all.
4
Went for business lunch here recently. It is tucked away in Labrador Park so a bit difficult to get to and from unless you have wheels.The gardens and the grand entrance up some steps lead to a classic colonial building which is in beautiful condition inside and outside.There is a beautiful bar and then the dining room off to the side. Lots of atmosphere to soak up.The restaurant was not busy, very attentive service and a great looking menu.As it was lunchtime I simply had a chicken pad Thai, very authentically done and extremely delicious.Would recommend for quiet gatherings family, friends or business. Will return one evening and enjoy a more thorough exploration of menu
3
We choose this restaurant based on some reviews that we read. We celebrated a family's birthday there. The restaurant is secluded from the busy city scene and more of a villa away from city. From the carpark to the restaurant is about 2 mins walk but it is quite dark. We have to turn on the hand-phone flash light to guide our way. The ambience is quite cosy, The mixed appertiser platter is nice - both in taste and appearance. The recommended green papaya salad did not meet the usual Thai standard. The pan seared foie-gras is excellent and generous. The famous duck curry and steamed sea-bass in Thai style is average. Their after meal tea selection is quite good. Service is quite attentive.
4
The setting in Labrador Park gives the restaurant a quaint and relaxing feel and the old colonial architecture definitely adds to the cosiness. Food was fresh and the taste strongly resembles the ones in Thailand itself.
5
love the ambiance and decor, definitely gives the romantic feel. tables are well spaced, and service was prompt and friendly. good for a walk in the surrounding lush greenery as well on a cool evening.
4
Authentic Thai cuisine in wonderful surroundings makes a dinner at Tamarind a great experience. Especially Tom Yam and the curries are excellent dishes and can be recommended to future diners.
4
Service and ambience was outstanding, would visit again. The food was good and had wine too. The overall setting was comfortable though the chair was a little wobbly but we got used to it after a while.
5
We went for a family dinner to celebrate our daughter's piano success.
As soon as we entered the premises it felt like holiday. Food is exceptional. Ambiente is wonderful.
Loved it.
4
The location is on top of the Labrador Park. The restaurant is inside the old black and white house, with a strong heritage atmosphere. They serve authentic Thai food. Food was just ok and pretty expensive. Service is good.
5
On 2 April 2017 was my daughters birthday and at the same celebrated my belated birthday at the Tamarind Hill Singapore by Samadhi. The ambience was very welcoming and the staff were very attentive, helpful and very friendly. The food was awesome specially the deep fried grouper, soft shell crab and green curry . Most of dishes go with the garlic and scallion rice. Not to mention my Favourite pomelo salad and the spicy tasty sumptuous Tom yam soup. Thai food is not complete with it. Will definitely go back to try the other dishes
5
Had lunch there to kick off my partners birthday month. Relax & peaceful place. Staff polite & friendly. Had Clear Tom Yim SoupChicken & Prawn SkewersMorning GloryBasil ChickenSeabassAdded plus. They have a proper bar!!!!Must try for locals & good spot for tourists to have a meal here & later take a walk at Labrador Park. Love it. We will be back.
4
This wonderful old building gives the guest a feeling of grandeur. We often take guests here. It is a special location with delightful Thai food that matches. Worth the journey. If you do, I suggest a restful approach. A cocktail stacking up the atmosphere before going to your table for some great food.
3
Had dinner there this week with a business group and was a little disappointed in the quality of the food. The ambience is lovely and the service was efficient and friendly, including taking care of the allergies and eating preferences about which they had been pre-warned, but the food itself was not as good as expected. The mixed starter plates were tasty but the beef satays were very thin and flat, and the accompanying peanut sauce lacked bite compared to many others; the red curry chicken was more bland than fragrant and flavourful, and the prawns were similar. Mango sticky rice dessert was good, but for the price and reputation I was hoping for much more memorable food at Tamarind Hill. I don't think I would recommend..
4
Dinner for birthday... on the terrace !
The place is very nice, the food excellent and portions generous !
Only 4 stars because the desert was not very tasty...
Anyway we will come back fir sure and skip the desert ;-)
4
it's a very good dining experience but e sparkling water is overpriced. Loves e dessert. Will revisit

The restaurant is set on a hill in Labrador Park, a lush nature reserve close to the sea. I had dinner there with colleagues on a Thursday evening and it was well patronised for a week day night. We order some appetisers like crispy calamari, fish cakes and even foie gras plus both the papaya and pomelo salad. The pomelo salad was much better than the papaya salad. The appetisers were nice but nothing to shout about. For the mains, we had beef masaman curry, chicken green curry, deep fried fish and morning glory fried with Chilli. The mains were much better! There are about 6 to 7 rice dishes and ordered 3 to try. They were good and goes well with the curry dishes. All in all, a good dinner in a nice setting. Service was good and relaxed. Recommended if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the restaurant scene and relaxed over a nice meal with friends
3
We had dinner this evening (5th March). The booking had got lost and no one had heard of us which is never a great way to start an evening. We arrived ahead of our friends who had booked - and emailed the confirmation to us - and did not want to make a fuss. The setting is lovely although this place is quite hard to find. Starters of fishcakes and a prawns were delicious. Red curry chicken became green curry - ordering wasn't easy and we seemed to be at cross purposes - but anyway it was good. Other dishes were enjoyable. Puddings were well made. The food here is interesting and well presented. Service was very poor. Bordering on rude. No one had any idea about the wine list. They didn't even know the types of wine on the list. Or even if there was Singha beer. Drinks came at all different times. We were ignored most of the time. As we were finishing dinner staff started doing a major reorganisation of furniture right next to us which was noisy and spoiled our conversation. Tables were being carted around and furniture dismantled. We couldn't believe it. It was as if we weren't there. We moved to the quieter (very nice) indoor terrace to finish our drinks. No one seemed bothered. No one said goodbye as we left. Not sure they even noticed. The bill was about 250 Singapore dollars per couple. This is not a cheap place.I don't recommend this place.
3
We had been there before and it was a favorite. But it seems to have dropped a little. The atmosphere was not a alive. The food while varied and good was not as excellent. The service was attentive but servers did not look busy and did not seem particularly engaged. Not bad but not the best. It is worth a try but I hope next time it will reflect our memories of times past. With a little work management could up their game.
5
This restaurant is really really exquisite. The villa is refurbished very nice making for a special atmosphere. The food is extremely tasty. Staff is very attentive in a discreet way. Superb experience for any special event or whatever you want to feel like it's a special event

Latest discovery!Tamarind Hill in an old Colonial house with a big garden. Nearby is Villa Samadhi, a 20-room boutique hotel also in a Colonial building hidden in the Labrador Nature Reserve.Saw a peacock on the grass on our way down the hill!Choice of brunch with or without free flow of beer, cocktails, wines etc. Choose whatever you want and as much as you want but don't waste.Small servings but actually not that small.Outdoor and indoor dining areas. Indoor 120 seats. Indoor, outdoor, bar and lounge more than 200 seats.Bar in the middle. Nice ambience.Good service.Poached tiger prawn wrapped in fresh salmon - goodSteamed pork with peanut in sago dumpling - I like this. It's different.Pomelo salad - yummyDuck with lychee salad - very nice but need more lycheesGalangal with coconut soup (choice of chicken or seafood) - this is like drinking coconut milk. Don't like it.Minced pork in clear soup - stock is quite good.Chicken in green curry - no breast meat! Otherwise, not bad.Steamed seabass with lime Chilli sauce - like thisDeep fried garoupa with sweet spicy & sour pineapple sauce - so so, think it's because it is not piping hotGarlic (with scallions) fried rice - ordinaryCoconut jelly - not the transparent jelly I was expecting, more like agar agar with blueberries and one raspberry and 2 green blades that look like grassPink diamonds with ice cream - this is what we normally call red rubies - they served two when we only ordered one. Good.Sunday brunch menu - see photo. Reasonably priced brunch
4
Thoroughly enjoyed the meal, i actually felt it was more Indonesia than Thailand but both work very well.The table service was excellent, the noise levels were just about right. Enough to give the comfort of sociality but not loud enough to prohibit conversations.Good chow
2
Expensive , cold , quality of food not great at all. Such a shame as the good here is normally great!
5
Atmosphere, food, service, ambient, cocktails, interior design, tasty exhibits everything is so well combined into perfect merge that will feed not only your taste buds but your soul too. One of those restaurants you'll never forget. Team of people who work there are every owners dream - to share his/her passion about the project and talk only in superlatives about their "family" at work dedicated to every shared dream, absolutely amazing. Very hard to find in copy paste industry of various franchisee. Bon appetite and big thank you everybody not to mention you one by one. We will come back
3
Good Place to have business meal. The lo hei salid is good & unique. Value for money. Just that the deco is more suitable for western food than asian cuisine
3
Went there for a family dinner. we got a table outside. the ambience was beautiful and the menu is extensive. loved the dishes we selected although some dishes were extremely spices despite the waiter telling us different.the only negative were the waiter. they hardly spoke english and could not really answer our questions nor did they make good recommendation. we ordered far too much food and forgot to add condiments like rice and vegetable, which the waiter could have recommended. other than that we had a nice evening
5
An amazing approach to the Thai style restaurant, nestled near the Labrador rescue park in Singapore.The bar is central to the grand entrance and once there, friendly staff greet you and offer drinks. Tamarind Hill make their own Gins, and these are truly sublime. Flavours range from lemon, orange, ginger, vanilla and many more!The food is one of the most authentic tastes outside of Thailand we have ever experienced. Tamarind Hill is a must visit for any visit to Singapore
5
The restaurant is not easy to find, but then when you get there you don't feel like you are in Singapore anymore. It is situated on top of Labrador Nature Reserve in a beautiful colonial house. It is perfect for a very nice romantic Thai dinner. We enjoy the food very much. The service was good
5
3rd time dining here n still feels great! With the nice ambience, nice fragrance lingering in the air n excellent service crew who attends to our need before we ask for it. This will always be a place I'll come back to. Food very fantastic too!!
2
Food - 9/10Ambience (outside) - 9/10Ambience (inside) - 8/10Service - 2/10For a singapore restaurant, there seems to be ample number of black-pyjama clad people 'serving' there - running around but forgetting to take your order, delivering it, messing it up. Given the A grade on other fronts, this expensive restaurant should give a better service
5
What a treat! I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner at Tamarind Hill and have been recommending it to my friends and coworkers. Very much a hidden treasure and I was pleased to have been introduced by a friend. It is not dreadfully expensive and a nice place to get away from the bustle of the city. The restaurant is tucked away in or by Labrador Park and located up a small hill from the parking lot so the walkup involves a lot of little stair steps (lit up with candles on the ground in the evening, lends a nice, romantic feel). We were greeted by staff at the entrance and walked into the bar area with a row of simple black chandeliers - the restaurant is dimly lit in both the indoor and outdoor patio area. We chose to share our plates and while I found the portions ran a little small, each dish was flavorful and we enjoyed the food very much. I thought the papaya salad was pretty decent but the appetizer sampler was a bit disappointing for the price. I would not go as far as to say they serve the best Thai in Singapore but I thoroughly enjoyed the food. Drinks wise, we shared a bottle of white wine and our server made sure we each had a tasting before pouring. We finished with digestifs and overall, had no qualms about the food/drinks or service

We have visited this Restaurant mid January with 3 other couples for a dinner - come together. Since we have not seen each other for a long time it took us a while until we were ready to order food and we stuck with drinks. The service was a bit impatient, forgot to pour me wine despite I was the one trying it. I wanted to order Tom Yam soup, usually it is spicy but the service told me that this is not the case, they recommend something else spicy. Unfortunately this was not true at all, it was probably the most unspicy Thaifood I ever tried.So far so good, the location is truly wonderful and most of our friends were happy with the food. After finishing our meal we wanted to order some more drinks, it was around 9.30 pm but they refused and said the bar is already closed. So we ordered the bill. While waiting for the bill they switch on very bright light and started to cleaning around us!!!! Incredibly rude and we felt like they wanted to literally kick us out. What a shame for such a nice location

Attended a business dinner here. The British colonial style restaurant is tucked away in Singapore. Upon entery they offered us a complementary tamarian juice and a house cocktail. I also had a gin and tonic. They have an amazing array of house infused gins and top shelf brands. I chose the lemon infused house gin. It was very good. We had a set menu because we where a large group. The meal was great we had chicken currant, satay, chili prawns,and stir fry veggies. They also had a large wine list. Defiantly the best restaurant I have been for a work dinner in Singapore so far.

A lovely, off-the-beaten-road restaurant in a restored Colonial house. The decor was impressive and welcoming (on a smaller scale than Alkaff Mansions at Telok Blangah Hill).We were there for a company dinner and had two long tables for 20 persons. The restaurant was almost full on a weekday dinner!Service was quite prompt and the food was excellent. However, we felt that the price-point was too high for the food served. Wished it was more reasonably priced.However, still worth a visit and great for a romantic dinner
5
Beautiful surroundings and restaurant - an oasis in busy Singapore. Food was excellent with authentic spice.
5
Was there to celebrate the wedding anniversary with my wife. The nod was romantic and the space between tables was big, that allowed for lots of privacy. The Thai food was great too, and in good portions.
5
It was an enjoyable evening with excellent service staff who is quick witted. Our needs were anticipated n met without us saying.
Thank you very much.

Great calm location, delicious food, friendly staff. Plenty of vegetarian options on buffet. Very recommendable for Sunday brunch.

This restaurant is a hidden treasure in the forest of Singapore. Had excellent Thai food with some friends. The chicken green curry was better than in Thailand. The service is just superb..
A must place to visit when in Singapore.
5
Wonderful ambience and food; amazing service and kitchen crew! Steeven, Sarah and Adrian were helpful and accommodating thruout. Kudos to Sarah for the effort and coordination while Adrian was away! We thoroughly enjoyed the evening and highly recommend Tamarind Hill as the go-to wedding venue!

I love this restaurant, beautiful setting, delicious good, excellent service.
And I'm thrilled to hear they're opening up a hotel next door in January/February.
Will be back...

In August 2016, I had suggested this restaurant to my friends who were visiting from India and about ten of us had a superb dining experience at Tamarind Hill at that time. Yesterday was my wife's birthday and we decided to take three of her friends to this restaurant for what was supposed to be a 'grand' dinner. This time, however, there was no warm welcome, the waitresses didn't seem to be well versed in English and two of the wines we wanted were not available even though on the menu. Even a simple thing like prawn crackers were not available due to a 'big event' the previous night. The food was very average and served lukewarm. I had specifically informed that the dinner was to celebrate a birthday but was told that the restaurant 'only served Thai desserts' and no cake would be served. A rather sad looking dessert cut into small pieces was brought with a candle instead. It was about 10.30pm when we finished and at that time there was no other diners in the restaurant. We asked the waitress to organise a maxi cab for us but when we went out, albeit a few minutes late (one of the guests went to the washroom), the cab had left. I tried calling the restaurant back on my cell phone from the steps (to get them to try and get the cab back) - got through once but got cut off and then when I tried calling again my call was not accepted. It had been raining heavily and all of us, senior citizens ranging from 62 to 81, had to carefully trudge to outside the main gate and wait for sometime before we got two taxis to take us home. We really came looking forward to "wonderful food and even better service" but in vain
5
We had a fantastic time at Tamarind Hill for our wedding. My husband and I were initially worried about the non-traditional programme for the wedding, and how our family would take it, but Adrian and Steeven were lovely and always helpful. We have received nothing but compliments on the celebration and the food, and it was very gratifying that we could leave the logistics to your staff leading up the day - it took a lot of stress off our shoulders. From our very first chat with Adrian and then with Steeven at the tasting to the wedding day, we've had a great time
5
Set back into the Jungle in a beautiful old Black and White, you'd have no idea that the hustle and bustle of Singapore was just a stones throw away!We've been here twice, and have walked away both times thinking that we'd had a special night as the setting adds a special quality to the food and service (which is also very good!)Worth chatting to the Manager about the interesting history of the buildin
5
Expensive but the service and food were both immaculate. Thoroughly enjoyed the ambience as well! The lady owner was Thai and was extremely hospitable :)
5
I don't mind great Thai food. Tamarind Hill is out of the way and secluded on beautiful grounds. The food is tasty and authentic!
5
romantic and lovely! i would recommend for couples! food and service was great! will definitely come back soon!
4
A variety Asian menu in a Colonial setting. Away from the tourist areas, this is a great place to take Singapore guests that enjoy Asian food in an interesting setting, that can be both in doors and outdoors. The wine menu was good and the food varied. The quality and service was at or above expectations
5
Visited Tamarind Hill Restaurant for a company event few days ago and it was awesome! Gonna be a long one so bear with it. First let's talk about the location. Hidden well on top of Labrador Reserve Park, a sweet break from the city. They managed to keep the charm of the original building and keeping it classy but friendly. LOVE the decoration around the bar area (the big mirror and the elegant chandeliers!) The sweet tune of nature buzzing all day long, a great way to escape from the traffic buzz for an hour or two. Second, the hospitality. Adrian and his team (Abdullah, Bobby, Eddy, Mo, Ramesh, Rose, just to name a few) were amazing! Thank you so much for saying yes to our requests and helping us in every possible way. For serving us food with smile and being more like an old friend. The team works well together and it actually helps creating the warm atmosphere for the house. Third, the food! We had canapÃ©s and pretty much tasted everything that Chef Pin has on her sleeves for that night. Love that they've catered for the different dietary preferences on the night, well-balanced flavor, altho some said not spicy enough but I think it's perfect considering people can actually enjoy the flavors and carry on with their conversation instead of breaking into sweats.So much good food, both sweet and savory gotta be one of the highlight. And not helping when their team make sure you taste every one of it. Typing this now makes me hungry! Been reading review on their drinks selection too. Ramesh, their alchemist showed me the infused gin collection. Love a place that encourages their team to experience and be creative. He showed me some of the collection he has; Lemon, Calamansi, Passionfruit, Ginger, Lemongrass, Pandan, the not so appealing capsicum and the sweet vanilla. Had the chance to try the Vanilla gin and tonic and man, IT WAS GOOD!!! So smooth and not overly sweet, it's the right drink to have when you want to unwind after a long day. If you prefer non-alcoholic beverage, their lemongrass water is refreshing and addictive. I will go back to Singapore and visit them again! Thank you so much, guys!

The food is very balanced and they serve some original variations of Thai cuisine. My favorite was the egg plant. The food is not as spicy as in most Thai restaurants, a bit adapted to Singapore taste. The place is extremely suited for large parties such as conferences, that they handle efficiently.
1
The ambience of Tamarind Hills was nice and welcoming, but it was disappointing that the service level was unsatisfactory due to the following experiences: 1. Order was served incorrectly.2. The staff were more interested to mingle amongst themselves instead of displaying attentiveness to the diners.3. I made a prior birthday cake request during the reservation but disappointedly, the request was missed out by the restaurant. Overall, should Tamarind Hills strives to be an elegant and impressionable dining place, I really hope the attentiveness and overall service levels of the restaurant staff can be improved vastly

My wife and I recently held our wedding lunch at Tamarind Hill and we both felt it was a resounding success. Our event proceeded without any glitches, and we both received very positive feedback on the food, despite most of the crowd being older and hence probably more used to the traditional Chinese banquet dishes. Planning was a 6-month process and through the months we communicated with Adrian Yuen, who remained very accommodating and understanding of our requests all the while. He was also very proactive with his suggestions but never ever pushy in any way. For our cocktail reception, he arranged for a snack bar to accompany the cocktails. This was particularly important as our tea ceremony was running over and so the guests had something to fill their stomachs with while they waited for lunch to commence.On the day of the wedding lunch, Adrian was flexible and on last minute notice, managed to cater for changes to the demarcation of the drop off point. This was important for the older folk amongst our guests. The service attitude of the staff, led by Steeven Nicnat was another plus point. Service was very personable and the staff got you whatever you wanted in relatively quick fashion. I believe this is due to the waiters being full-timers, as opposed to the archetypal banquet waiter one faces at a hotel wedding. Through the course of the lunch the service staff also proactively kept my Wife and I informed of any special requests from our guests, to make sure we were fine adding these items to our bill.Steeven provided really good suggestions during our food tasting and was very clear in communicating how our dishes would turn out on our wedding day. All in all, if you are looking for a cozy, personable and alternative venue to hold a wedding reception, look no further than Tamarind Hill

Not every taxi driver will know where it is, but it's fantastically located on top of a hill. Very nice house and great ambience. We have been here many times already and last time we took a friend. Really classy Thai food, maybe one of the best Thais in Singapore. It's a little on the expensive side, there's definitely cheaper Thai places with similar quality of food, but still it 'has' something. Nice place I could recommend
5
It is a nice location, but have to walk a bit from the train station if you do not drive. Nice ambience and the staff are friendly and pleasant. Although there was a hiccup in one of our dishes, the staff acted promptly and we appreciate their efforts in handling it.
4
Love the desserts especially the coconut with jackfruit, red rubies and ice cream. The fried banana fritters with rum and raisin was yummy too!
4
We ordered mango salad, seafood tom yum soup, wagyu green curry, garlic rice 3 glass of white wine. Abt 225 sgd. left v full.

Beautiful black and white bungalow surrounded by greenery , good service and food . We will definitely go back .

This is a quaint place tucked away at one corner of Labrador park. Generally, this is not where you would look for a restaurant. Therefore, unless you know about this place, chances are you will not discover it. I would recommend lunch here since you will be able to enjoy the lush greenery around. The menu is well spread out. This is mainly a Thai restaurant but they do offer other cuisines as well. A very quiet and peaceful ambiance and not many people around, at least on the day we went. That way the charm is maintained. The decor is something to be admired as well. Try the money bag for starters. It was sumptuous. For the main course, if you plan to order from the lunch menu then don't expect a big portion. If you are really hungry I suggest you order from the main menu and not the lunch hour specials. If in a large group it is better to get a reservation before you turn up. Afterwards, if you have a car, you can always drive up to the Labrador park beach front to enjoy the lovely view and the sea breeze
4
I wasn't disappointed with the food at Tamarind Hill, just underwhelmed. The wine list was good, until they didn't have what I requested. I suspect detailed things like this might test the management of this group of restaurants.The location is good, effectively in the jungle, and with the building and decor matching that theme, our party found it a very enjoyable evening.Take time to have a drink on the patio, and look forward to a relaxed dinner, without too much efficiency, but good friendly service
4
Food was of high quality and fresh. Highly tasty, no complaints at all. Knowledge of service staffs could improve - especially on food allergies as the chef has to speak to us a number of times to take orders. Service staffs could be better equipped with interest and knowledge on such topics in a very well established, top quality restaurant.
5
Tamarind Hill is a Favourite. I first when as a guest and have been back many times. The settling of a grand old "Black and White" from the colonial era set in lush gardens makes it stand out. It has been restored and fitted out so you can sip a cocktail and bring your heart rate down to a very restful pace. When you are ready you can move to one of the dining spaces to enjoy some great Thia food. Having lived in Thailand I am rather sensitive to Thai, I really enjoy what I am served at Tamarind Hill.
5
I was not very sure if Tamarind Hill could serve some non-spicy dishes. Called to enquire and was glad they could 'tailor' to my needs. They could separate chilli for dipping. They could give me a nice table, indoor, for 8 pax on a Sunday night. Three of us arrived on time. Five pax were pretty late. But the staff seated us at the indoor foyer (waiting lounge), gave us the drinks menu, served us nice fruit punch with & without liquor. When everyone was here, we were led into the dining hall, nicely arranged table & cutlery, pretty away from other guests. I loved the cleanliness & serenity. My guests 'wowed'! The lafy staff helped us made a few wonderful choices of dishes for my guests who were just 'okay' with spicyness. We were glad all dishes turned out well, especially the fried fish, asparagus, egg plants and many more. They ckear soup (tom yum) was tasty! They recommended us 2 plates of dessert platters to end the evenjng & for our guests to try, true enough, they were yummy. We got to taste every piece of Thai handmade dessert! The kids had yummy coconut icecream, these Taiwanese girls loved it so much. We had a wonderful time, staff were patient & service-oriented, ambience was perfect. I even checked with them if companies could organise functions there, they showed me the place & explained what they could do! Yes, I have given out your cards to my friends too. My guests left with great smiles, a stomach full of great samples of yummy Thai food, not spicy, not oily! We will be back again!Thank you to all the staff who made our evening a memorable one

The steep walk through the Labrador Park is well rewarded by the warm welcome, the spicy and generous Thai dishes, and the unique atmosphere of the Tamarind Hill restaurant. We enjoyed the culinary experience which felt authentic and rare, especially in contemporary Singapore. The restaurant is spacious and mystical, almost magical
4
The restaurant is set in a charming colonial mansion among the greenery of Labrador Park. You need a car to get here. There is outdoor seating under shade but we sat indoors. All the dishes we ordered were yummy, including the clear tom yam soup with assorted seafood, Pork neck in red curry, morning glory and stir fried beef with asparagus. Non-vegetable dishes are around $30 or more, very pricey compared to most Thai restaurants in Singapore, but the quality is high and given the surroundings, this place is good for special occasions. The Thai waitress who served us was enthusiastic and smiley. If not for the high prices, I would rate it excellent.
5
Excellent dining experience, perfect ambiance and superb food without breaking your budget! Perfect choice for date lunch/night. :)
4
I never heard of this restaurant until my friend recommend to me. It seems many business people come instead family guest. The house has charm and very quite. Of course they have good food~.
4
This place is really amazing. great selection of wines and other alcoholic beverages. wide variety to select from the menu. we were a large group of around 15 but still the customer service and speed of getting food on the table was excellent.
5
My partner recommended this place. The restaurant is tucked inside the labrador nature reserved.I was pleasantly surprised and impressed at the same time. The restaurant was packed when we came yet the service was good. They have great food too with wide variety of choices.The restaurant have indoor and outdoor tables. I like that the table arrangement were far apart to enjoy a private conversation
5
Such an atmospheric setting in a beautiful spacious building with lovely garden outside. One of the best thai meals I've had in Singapore, perfectly cooked vegetables, fish well cooked with subtle spices and we loved the okra rice. Service was good and the atmosphere was very relaxing. We also enjoyed the bar with its skilled bartenders who made a fabulous g&t. We will return
5
In a huge refurnished colonial bungalow atop a hill in secluded Labrador Park is this most amazing restaurant. Ambience is elegant and second to none. Privacy is guaranteed. Service is first-rate. Free parking. Food is a cross between Thai and Myanmar food, served in small portions. Flavours are exquisite. Discreet -- to entertain important guests or a quiet tete-a tete
5
Love the ambience of this Restaurant and the delicious food is an added bonus!We dined with our parents this time - our second visit, and they were also impressed with the food.Service is excellent also. Staff are very friendly and helpful and my mother doesn't eat Coriander - which is a big ask to ask for omission in a Thai Restaurant - but nothing was too hard for them and it was taken on board with a smile We were also given a delicious dessert as complimentary (4 people) when they found out it was our Anniversary

Nestled near Labrador Nature Reserve, the restaurant is located in a refurbished colonial bungalow. The dÃ©cor is in black and white coloured theme; the rustic wooden flooring and windows are largely retained throughout the premises.Thai artefacts are displayed in different parts of the bungalow. The house music played was the type usually found in a spa. The wait staff are dressed in casual black t-shirt and bermudas with slippers.Whilst the restaurant was not crowded, there was a mini-party held which did mar the otherwise quiet and peaceful atmosphere. There were other patrons scattered near where we sat. Due to the structure of the bungalow, conversations over the table can be heard - unless it's the outdoor dining area.Not having a big appetite, we decided to order only a few dishes and add-on if the portions were not sufficient.For starters, it was the green mango salad and pan fried foie gras. The salad was fresh, juicy with salmon bits. The spiciness of the salad does not linger. It just "hits" you, then dissipates.The foie gras, browned on the surface, and its tender texture tasted perfect with the mango sauce. The accompanying fried sweet potato strips were crisp but not oily.Next came the flash fried squid with tamarind sauce and clear tom yum seafood soup. In the former, the freshness of the squid made it chewy. The tamarind sauce added a twist with its mix of sourness and spiciness, but it was not overbearing since we had jasmine rice as well.We have had similar tom yum soup where tom yum paste is sometimes used and were oiler. However, this soup was a clear broth, with various types of mushroom, fish and prawns. With an excellent blend of various ingredients, the soup was very appetising and made us yearn for more.My husband was already filled after polishing the soup and did not want dessert. I decided to order the pumpkin custard and coffee jelly with chocolate ice-cream. I liked that it combined the sweetness of pumpkin custard, bitterness of coffee and refreshing ice-cream. This is not a signature dessert but it was good.After lunch, we went outside the restaurant to wait for our taxi. One of the managers asked us to wait within the premises instead. He cited the still-pouring moderate rain and possible mosquitos as reasons for us to re-enter the restaurant, which is a thoughtful gesture.It was our first visit to Tamarind Hill and we are not disappointed. The relatively casual atmosphere, lush surroundings and delectable cuisine made it an memorable experience
5
The location is in the Labrador Park of Singapore. It is nice and isolated villa. The brunch was various and tasty. There is a good variaty of drink to accompany your food. The espresso is very good. I took two. The staff is kind with the childrens and the manager is very friendly. All this in a wonderful villa
5
Wow! This is truly a first class restaurant. The decor is to die for! A wonderful old colonial building up on a sloping hill with fantastic views. We were very warmly welcomed and invited to choose a cocktail, before taking our places in the dining room. I started my meal with soft shell crabs, followed by spicy squid and mixed vegetables. My husband started with squid followed by duck. We finished with banana fritters for me and 'pink diamond' for my husband, which was a combination of fruit and ice cream. Everything was mouth-watering and utterly delicious. We were fortunate enough to meet our charming hostess, who explained the house's history - soon to be a hotel! This is for special occasions or a crazy splash-out, as in our case
4
Love the ambience & the scent when we first step in . Wasn't expecting there will be such a place to dine !! Will come back again :)
4
Interesting Thai dishes with ingredients you don't find commonly used in typical Thai restaurants. And with nice greenery outdoor environment if u choose to sit outdoor.
5
One of our favourite restaurants in Singapore, especially when out of town guests are visiting! Great place!
5
Great intimate setting and delicious food. The infused gin and tonics were a very good predinner start.
5
Tamarind Hill is a beautiful historic building amidst the green foliage of Labrador Park. It is decorated beautifully and evokes the feeling of being on a leisurely retreat away from the hustle and bustle of the daily grind. It’s the perfect place for Sunday brunch. They offer an extensive spread for a very affordable price. The food is authentic and very flavorful. The staff are wonderful and are very knowledgeable about the property and its history. They are incredibly attentive and make the experience all the more delightful. Would definitely be going back for more amazing food and ambiance
5
Tastefully decorated this mid 1800 building is complimented beautifully by the impeccable service and attention to detail. The food itself is great and overall experience is perfect for a romantic dinner or even a brunch with friends. Sunday brunch is very reasonable for he selection of food and quality. Highly recommended for a great experience
5
Despite returning from Bangkok recently, the food here is as authentic as it gets! And the ambience is a perfect location for a romantic evening out or even with friends and family!Beautifully housed in a colonial property, service staff are attentive and overall ambience is calm, serene and peaceful.Definitely would love to try out their weekend brunch which is the only time kids are allowed to dine there.Must try for good Thai food
5
It was an absolute retreat nestled in lush greenery. Tucked away from the hustle and bustle of busy Singapore. The manager Helen made our day remembering my birthday with a lovely dessert platter. She told us about the history of that place and it made it even more special....thank you.
4
Modern Thai restaurant and the location is beautiful. Went on a Sunday and was warmly greeted by the hostess. Gave us a quick tour before settling us down to a table and explained that they were having some sort of a Sunday buffet menu. Food took a while to be served and we noticed that there were other tables who arrived later than we did, but being served first. Could just be of the type of food we ordered. Nonetheless, when the food was out, we were not disappointed. Good service that wasn't too intrusive but were available when you needed it.
4
We were very impressed with this restaurant.There was a choice of an a la carte menu or a set dinner,we chose the a la carte as there were certain dishes we fancied,The Tom Yam soup and the red duck curry were perfect.The steamed red snapper was okay but a bit dull in the way it was cooked.The pandan creme brûlée was delicious.The wine list was extensive,with a lot of choice of wine by the glass,good when you are driving.In general the service was helpful and friendly,and the ambience in this old British Army colonial house is unique
4
Brought a friend to celebrate his birthday. Nice food, didn't quite like the Steam Bass. Desserts were the best.
4
beautiful ambience, and rare service for Singapore! Food was good but not particularly unique or innovative.
4
I was there few weeks ago for a wedding reception. The food, thai fusion, and the service were good, and the wine selection was interesting. Lovely location and atmosphere.
5
I love the location of the colonial set-up restaurant on a hill surrounded by nature. The food was good with exceptional service. Ambience was very romantic and exclusive. Would definitely dine there again!
5
First of all, the location of Tamarind Hill, just inside Labrador Park, is second to none in Singapore. The old black-and-white building is extremely picturesque; the inside oozes character and an understated cool sophistication. The restaurant is surrounded by lush vegetation, especially copious amounts of pandan leaves, and serves as a surprising antithesis of the concrete, steel and glass that exists just a stone's throw away, heightening the sense of seclusion once you're here.Secondly, the food is Thai. It's really good food. I could reel off numerous dishes as recommendations, but here are 2:1. Soft Shell Crab tossed with kaffir-line flavoured sea salt and tropical fruit salad 2. Steamed sea bass served in lime & chiliThirdly, the service is impeccable. This is the best service I have ever had (globally!), and not just from one or two of the restaurant staff; I mean the whole team. We have eaten here a couple of times, and suffice to say the service has been spot on consistently across both visits. The service is akin to being greeted by hosts more so than waiting staff; they are laid back, accommodating, sincere and simply augment the overall experience of eating at Tamarind Hill. Lastly, I got married at Tamarind Hill. We were there for the whole day and, in the interest of brevity, this is my comment: everything I said above multiplied by 10
5
My Wife and I got married in the beautiful and unique setting of Tamarind Hill last month. We chose the venue having eaten there a few times, loved the food and enjoyed the 'escape' feeling from Singapore City life. The building is set in a quiet oasis in Labrador Nature reserve and wonderfully no other building in sight. The owners have the highest interior design taste, taking advantage of the unique heritage building.We were not let down in the slightest for the big day itself.As much as a review, this is a thank you to Adrian, Steven and team for making our day so special. They were highly professional and accommodating in the build up, knowing all the little touches to make it an evening to remember. Our guests absolutely loved the Thai food and it was as good as when we have dined their privately, which considering 130 people were served at the same time that was quite some effort. The Pimms and Singapore slings were a hit with both those from Singapore and those who had flown in from England. Adrian also gave us excellent advice on the wine and his recommendation was conscious of budget.We would highly recommend the Sunday brunch for a more regular visit. We look forward to going back soon.Tamarind Hill team - thanks again for everything. It really was the perfect venue on our perfect day.

Tamarind Hill is a wonderful experience as it combines nicely presented and good Thai food, discreet service and a relaxing atmosphere in a beautiful colonial black and white house.The restaurant has never been very full at lunchtime on the 3 occasions I was there, which may be due to it's out of the way location. It is set in lush vegetation and has been renovated to a charming rustic colonial style. The waiting staff are helpful and attentive, the ambient music is conducive to a calm atmosphere and the sticky rice and mango dessert is not to be missed! I imagine it is lovely in the evening and hopefully a bit fuller. We ate indoors, but there is a lovely wide veranda outside, which is very pleasant too.Definitely worth the trek up the hill
3
Was dragged for a surprise dinner here a few weeks ago. Place wasn't packed but it was a challenge for us to get the waitress' attention. Ambiance and view of the place is okay, but come on, people go here not only for the ambiance but for sure of course for the food as well. I've had better Thai food at Golden Mile

1) Massive errors with reservations:My reservations was done last week when the dinner was confirmed, for 7 pax. Then I had amended the booking with Chope.com to 8 persons’ booking on March 3 and confirmed with their staff again 30 min before the guests arrive in the restaurant on Wednesday and I specifically reminded their staff to prepare a table for 8 to be ready before my guests arrive. To our disappointment, none of all these efforts worked. Their staff were unable to first find our booking for 10 min, and when they finally found, they insist that I had booked for only 7 persons and my guests had to wait while they prepare. After they brought my guests to their table, their service staff approached them 2 times more, to confirm who had made the reservation, whose name is the reservation booked under, and reiterated that we only booked for 7. Utter embarrassment. To make things worse, their service staff directed another guest to our table, saying that our table is for him, that made the customer as puzzled as my guests. 2) Inflexible Orders and Inexperience staff/ captainMy hosts asked for recommendation, your staff said, “nothing, all our food are good.” Is this how you educate and train your staff to take orders? Absolutely no recommendation? No house specials? One of our guest is an Vegetarian. Hence, during ordering, we asked for some of the dishes to omit fish sauce, as that is the only “non-veg” ingredient. However, their staff insisted it cannot be done, and they can only select the very limited choices of vegetarian option. Are we listening wrongly? Is this really, a 5 star standard restaurant or worse than a zichar stall’s flexibility? Is your kitchen really unable to omit the fish sauce, or your service staff can’t be bothered to ask? 3) Long waiting timeOur guests arrived at 6:30 pm sharp and ordered at 6:45 pm, it took 30 min for the first dish to arrive, and another 1.5 hours for the 2nd dish to arrive. By the time they end the dinner, it was later than 10 pm. This was a disappointing experience. For the price we paid, we'd rather visit a normal Thai restaurant
5
We had my wife's birthday dinner here, dined alfresco (you have a look on genuine jungle from the patio :) and enjoyed ourselves _very_ much. Quite in the middle of the Labrador Nature Reserve, kind and attentive staff, great food (both Asian and Western options) and a good selection of drinks. Probably can handle large groups, very spacious
4
Amazing restaurant in a beautiful setting, great food and drinks though service was a bit slow. Highly recommend for a special occasion.
5
We went for dinner on a Friday evening. Food was superb. We are light eaters - had mango salad, Apple and herbs roll which was amazing followed by red curry and sautéed vegetables with jasmine rice. Great ambience on the balcony. Loved our evening.
5
Real gem in the middle of nowhere. Great ambience and food. Special thanks to Helen the manager who was fantastic with our 4 year old
5
Great place to have a cozy lunch wedding event over here. The place is nice and able to handle a big group of people.
1
We received confirmation for table for 4 pax, 2 adults and 2 children ages 12 and 14, followed by a call from Tanarind Hill staff that children below 14 are not allowed. This is indeed disappointing and rude!
5
This is one of my favourite, if not my favourite restaurant in Singapore. Its isolated position on the top of a hill gives it an air of tranquility which is difficult to find in Singapore. If you walk up to the restaurant you can see the old British gun placements from the 19th Century which adds to the colonial atmosphere.The building itself is an old black and white which has been superbly restored to give it a modern yet classic feel. I would highly recommend taking your time and enjoying a drink in the main bar or entrance hall first where you will experience fantastic service and an introduction to the homemade drinks.The staff go out of their way to give you a special experience and will try and cater to all your needs. The food itself is fantastic as well. Modern Thai food with some old classics thrown in. Everything I tried was delicious and you certainly won't leave feeling hungry.Whilst it is not cheap, you pay for what you get and I feel it is worth every penny

Feels like your are not in the busy Singapore, as soon you enter you are in another world. Calm, quiet, serene, almost a SPA a Sanctuary for your soul. Talking about the food, basically one of my best Thai dinner including my monthly trips to Bangkok :-

brought the missus down for an anniversary dinner - and as always, am not disappointed! Started with their complimentary lemongrass drink, followed by exquisite gin cocktails. The food was so so good, and unlike other more 'artisanal' places, actually filling! It's more than a restaurant - the surrounding area is a hidden gem of natural beauty, perfect for sitting around chilling. Perhaps that's why someone was having a marriage proposal there while we watched, and that is also why one of my best mates had his wedding there

outside the city, only accesable by car of taxi, is this restaurant located. We visited it in a very large group (80 people) and the restaurant was able to handle that adequately. Often is in big groups the quality of the food not at the same standard as when served for a table of 2. Nevertheless managed the restaurant to put up a delicious vietnamese tasting salad and starters; some well prepared dishes as main course in an enjoyable atmosphere.

My wife took my young son and I here for my birthday. Normally, they don't allow kids but brunch is the sole exception. The location is fabulous as its in an old black-and-white house, nestled away nicely from the regular hustle and bustle. The minute you arrive at the place you forget that you're in a busy city. Once we were seated we were presented where you could order any amounts of food from the menu at a fixed price. Some dishes were outstanding and some were decent. The salad bar also had a small but interesting selection with the usual mango salad, and a basil chicken spread for rice crackers. For appetizers we had spring rolls, dumplings and the massaman chicken burger. The dumplings and the massaman curry were quite good. Then we ordered mains and we inexplicably had quite a wait, so I couldn't understand why they didn't take the entire order in the first place. We ordered green curry chicken, pad thai, pineapple fried rice, mushrooms in basil, stir fry beef. The green curry was good, but I've had better. The stir fry beef was very good and probably the standout dish. The rest were good, though the pad thai was ordinary. I was hoping that some dishes would be truly fiery, but perhaps it was my fault for not requesting that they spice it up. The service was good but a bit slow, which seemed slightly out of synch with the overall elegance of the place. My wife reminded the wait staff a few times that it was my birthday but other than offering a confused confrontation they didn't seem to have any protocol for such a situation. Luckily for us the manager Helen heard about this and she sprung into action. For a while we had been wondering who this charming and elegant lady was graciously accommodating my son while he was running around exploring the place. Helen immediately whipped up a small complimentary dessert platter with sticky rice, mango pudding and coconut ice cream. All of it was good, the unexpected surprise made it great. Even without this, we would have been sure to come back, now its practically guaranteed. In the crowded Singapore restaurant scene, Tamarind Hill offers a somewhat unique experience. If they improve their service and dial up the quality of their dishes a bit, it would be absolute heaven

Came here for company dinner. The property was quite impressive - very high ceiling, nice decor in a colonial compound. Many foreigners there for drinks. Food was Thai but it was not as impressive as the property, just average.
5
Gorgeous black and white colonial building. Good Thai food. Excellent service from Steven and his team! A lovely experience every time. My Favourite Thai restaurant in Singapore!!
4
We were really late for our reservation. And they had almost closed but kept the kitchen open for us.
4
Good food and lovely venue. Nice place for celebrating an occasion. Service was quick and food was good. I would go back ...but with some mozzie spray.
I wish they did something about mozzies though...
5
Was here for my wedding anniversary. Price is on slightly higher side, but friendly service crew, nice food and the great ambience make it all worth it..
4
So, I was just here last night for a good friend's wedding dinner reception, and I must say, the thai food here is really nice! The lamb curry and pandan chicken was my favourite! Followed by the chicken Tom yum soup! I'm not one for spicy food, so I was a bit apprehensive. But I was pleasantly surprised by how authentic it taste yet, I could handle the spice level! Quite a romantic location as well
5
We just held our wedding lunch on Saturday, 5 Dec 2015. We had booked this restaurant last year and the sales manager, Mr Adrian Yuen has been patient with us throughout by replying our enquiries and providing alternative solutions. The floor staff's service and attitude were excellent too and all my guests enjoyed the food and the ambience. Will definitely recommend this place to my friends
4
This is a very good place for a dinner with family or friends, or for a business occasion. It has the look and it has the atmosphere, with tasty decor and little candle lights around. It will wake up your senses and sharpen your palette:) The food is varied, with a number of dishes to choose from: meat lovers, fish/ seafood lovers, and vegetarians will all find something to suit their tastes. The food is light, with a lot of spices and inspiring mixes of ingredients, and nicely presented. Altogether, an interesting fusion between Eastern and Western cuisine.However, having been there a couple of times, I find this restaurant a bit inconsistent: The taste of the food does not always catch up with the overall elegance and ambience of the place. Also, the quality of service can vary - senior staff members are dedicated and have a great attitude, but others are just sloppy, which puts the service below standard. Definitely worth trying, though. Book a table in advance, and bear in mind that this place hosts closed events on some dates
4
Since our last visit here, the food quality has improved considerably, both in presentation and quality. I would definitely recommend a visit here.The place remains a little pricey, but I believe it is justified.The location is superb - away from the hustle and bustle of town
3
We went during lunchtime and had the pad Thai, tom yum, steamed chicken with peanut dumpling, honey dew with sago and pandan pudding. The pad Thai was not too bad but the steamed chicken with peanut dumplings had too much peanuts. The desserts were freshly made so it wasn't quite cold yet. Service was prompt though uncomfortable cause they are waiting jus right next to us. The location is interesting so it's worth visiting
2
Jasmine rice for 5 bucks per head? That's stupid. The food was not bad but it certainly wasn't fine dining nor can or a should command these sort of prices.
3
Had dinner there this week.
This restaurant could be so much better.
The location is excellent, especially if you eat outside.
The food is good Thai food.
The service however is unbelievably slow.
Please fix this, because we would like to come back again sometime.
4
If you are looking for a Thai Fine Dine, Tamarind Hill is a must do. The food quality is Excellent and service is correct. A Wonderful cadre ideal for business meetings or couples dinner / lunch.
5
We loved the place. All was very tasty and beautifully served. The place design is beautiful and the service was great. Certainly looking forward to come there again some day when we'll be in Singapore.
4
Servings are large and food is very nice indeed. Lovely spot to experience old colonial Singapore.
Staff were great with the children too, following them outside with mozzie repellent!
Wasn't cheap but not much is in Singapore now.

Tamarind Hill is one of the most fantastic Thai restaurant in Singapore with nice docoration and delicious Thai foods. We went there for business talk and felt so relaxed for the cozy atmosphere. We enjoyed all Thai cuisines especially green curry and Pamelo salad.
4
Awesome ambiance, great service and staff. Bartender was lovely, he kept offering us suggestions for cocktails. Overall the food was excellent. However a few things they could improve on include the papaya salad, the fried prawns and the sticky mango rice desert. Chicken red curry was outstanding and we really enjoyed the grilled fish.
4
arrived in the evening to what was obviously an old colonial house and as we walked up the steps the doors were opened by the waiting staff. Super building and the restaurant is organised so that most of the tables have a semblance of privacy. Menu was very interesting and the food was very tasty but not as I would have expected. Therefore my message would be to go there with an open mind and ready to enjoy food rather than to expect a particular dish to taste exactly the same as you had elsewhere. i really enjoy Massaman curry but over the past 6 weeks travelling Asia I have had several 'taste' versions - and not like I get in the UK. Here it was different again and who is to say what is the right taste - all I can say is that this one I enjoyed it a lot
4
The property is tucked away in a lush green corner of Singapore, and upon entering the big white doors, you are transported into Singapore's unique past - colonial black and white, and the mood is almost surreal. Greeted kindly by the welcoming staff, you are seated at a table set away far from other patrons, letting one enjoy a private setting to remember. The hardwood floors, high ceilings and cool lighting, make a romantic ambiance. We took a table indoors, because we were afraid that the mosquitoes outside could ruin our moment. The service staff are kind and friendly, offering to keep our cake, and to bring it out later for our own private celebration. There is much to choose from the menu, and we enjoyed the sea bass very much. The portions are quite big. We also had apple/cucumber rolls as appetizers, kai lan and kaffir rice. After our meal, we explored the porch outside, and enjoyed the peace and quiet, away from modern Singapore

We went as a party of 5 for dinner recentlyIf this was a school report it would read ' Tamarind Hill is full of promise but lacks attention to detail, and despite much promise really must try much harder'To explain the location is wonderful in a beautiful old black and white perched on top of Labrador Park. A stunning location. The bar is welcoming and the barman was very good advising cocktails and twists and a traditional G &T!Once at the table the menu offers such promise , a wide variety of Thai fusion and traditional delights to satisfy any taste Starters were very good ( Thai fish cakes, calamari, salmon cubes) but from here it went down hill The service was very poor with the staff forgetting things, no attention to detail and even grimacing when we ordered chilled water instead of buying bottled waterThe meals were very tasty but all except the red snapper arrived tepid at best (the veggies and rice were warmer) and rapidly got coldSo in conclusion worth a visit , do not expect good service and expect a hefty billA pity as this Resteraunt could be fantastic with better attention to detail , customer service and a strong front of house lead
4
Wonderful combination they have for these 2 types. The duck breast served with grapes and lychee in red curry, interesting and delicious. Lamb chop is great too. Well done chef. Am enjoying this evening.
4
We went in a group of ten and were welcome at the entrance and went straight to the bar for a drink. Good service there and all the evening. The ambiente is colonial but modern and exclusive. We sat at a large table inside and had great thai style food, seafood and of course the usual curry. All tasted great but expect prices on the side.Parking is easy at the back of the building as the restaurant is in a nature reserve and no other traffic is around
5
We got married at Tamarind Hill earlier this year and I count ourselves extremely lucky that it was available on our specified date with only 11 weeks to the BIG day. Everything was perfect - the amazingly delicious food, the set-up, the service and as for most brides, the level of communication and flexibility leading up to the wedding. Big thanks to Adrian and his team for making our wedding day very special and we can't wait to go back for date-night! They've done so well to accentuate the beautiful old and charming black and white colonial building it is and don't forget to have a sun-downer so you get a peek of the ocean. Do yourself a favour and have a meal there - I guarantee a wonderful experience
3
Decided to try this place for dinner with my wife. Was impressed when we first walked in. Ordered 4 items off the menu. However, despite the prices, the food was not as fancy as the place and was quite a letdown because we didn't feel that the quality matched the prices charged.Would we visit this place again? Not anytime soon
5
It is so roomy. this is an Old Colonial House set amidst greenery and the fragrance the minute you arrived is relaxing fragrance like a SPA in Bali. Immediately one already feels relaxed and ready for a wonderful meal. There is a bar area so you can sit there, chat and have drinks first. Food is modern Thai and its good but its really a destination dinner place that takes your breadth away
5
Thai food lovers should definitely visit this restaurant. The service in this restaurant was outstanding.. Every dish was very well cooked, served properly. This place is perfect in every sense. I am a fan of its clear tom yum soup with assorted mushrooms, papaya salad and thai style minced chicken with basil leaves. Never had the same flavour anywhere else so fa
4
A good business dinner from the Gin and tonics on arrival to the exceptional food and the wine selection. All tastes were surprised and the food was of exceptional quality, it is always difficult entertaining overseas guests but all had only positive feedback for the restaurant and staff. A great experience and we will be back both for business and a private dining experienc

My husband and I were on our regular Friday date for lunch. We were the only customers for lunch on a Friday afternoon and it felt rather weird to have a few waiter standing around as we ate. We had called ahead for reservations and there was a group of 3 ladies that left just as we entered but the waiters seemed surprised that there were more customers.The food was very fine and tasty, plated beautifully. An upmarket take on Thai food, using premium ingredients with equally upmarket prices. The restaurant is in an old colonial house in a park with teak floors, tastefully decorated and tables are set far apart so it is a nice place for a romantic time, if only the waiters did not hover so much!We had a lovely walk in Labrador Park after that to round off the date
5
Tamarind Hill is a real hidden gem with a lot of character. Set in the Labrador Natural Reserve far from the hectic city life but still easy to reach, is the perfect spot for your relaxed dining experience in a unique setting! I’ve taken a few friends there and also organized a company event there - it’s a great mix of the best of Singapore (nice architecture, nice setting) plus yummy modern Siamese food (mix of Thai & Burmese.) To try for sure
5
The location is beautiful and very impressive, it's like entering an elegant resort. The noise of the creatures in the foliage is so lovely! Greeted with a warm welcome and went for a few drinks at the bar first. The tables are really well spread out unlike many restaurants. Each group has lots of space, the menu is beautiful, we chose a selection of Thai appetisers, the prawns wrapped in salmon were particularly impressive with lovely fresh and fragrant spices. I chose the snapper with chilli and lime and husband had a bee curry. They will refill the rice for you which is good. We spent at least three hours here and enjoyed every minute, had a delicious and well priced Sauvignon Blanc high was served beautifully and kept really cold throughout, husband had a well-priced Pinot noir. We will definitely return and recommend bringing visitors here as it is a special setting
5
This is an excellent Thai fusion restaurant. The ambiance and the quality of the food set Tamarind Hill apart from any other Thai restaurant in Singapore.
4
Very unique Thai selection! Every item came out well presented and had good, fresh taste. Desserts were awesome! Location is very peaceful and segregated from the fast-pace City life.
3
... this restaurant was so busy mid-week. Food was average, service was average, price isn't cheap and the location isn't convenient! Still it is very attractive and a nice break from the city.
5
Arriving at the stunning old black-and-white building housing the visually beautiful restaurant Tamarind Hill, you're greeted with a short but dramatic staircase, with flickering tea-candles on each stair and a smiling hostess waiting to greet with you a complimentary glass of tamarind juice. Listening to frogs and night insects droning outside, it's a cool oasis in the lush greenery of Labrador Reserve, and everything about this dining experience was enjoyable. Staff were extremely polished, well-trained and enthusiastic about their work. Rashmi, the bar-tender, suggested we try some of his own gin and tonic mixes with unusual aromatics - as gin afficionados, were were thrilled with this suggestion and the results: London 43 with cracked black pepper and star anise; and Monkey 47 with dried blueberries and a cinnamon stick were just two of the standout mixes we tried. He was really great, and even brought out some of the bottles of the gin brands we weren't so familiar with to let us take a look. So hospitable and helpful! The meal was delicious - mussels, a yellow curry with good variety of seafood, stir-fried pork with green chillies, spicy and sweet pomelo salad - everything we tried, we enjoyed. Service remained attentive, careful and very professional. The ambience is outstanding. I warmly recommend this as an outstanding Singapore dining experience. Easy parking right behind the old house if you're driving yourself
5
We booked a table for ten to celebrate a friend's birthday. I had enjoyed dinner at the Tamarind Hill but it was the first time for all the other guests. The setting of the restaurant is very unique in an old black and White House set up on a hill. We were given a lovely room with two very professional staff to guide us through the menu and lunch. Steveen and Heng Heng were extremely helpful and very patient as friends decided between the lunch time menu and the full al la carte options. The red and green curries were a hit and we each enjoyed a mango sticky rice for dessert! Everybody declared they would like to return and enjoy the delicious Thai food another time
4
Again, recommended by a friend living in Singapore. Beautiful old black and white on a small hill top in a reserve - take a map as the taxi driver may not know where to go. Sit outside on the hardwood verandah and listen to the barking Gecko's. Food is very good and the location is really still and quiet, apart from the breeze through the trees. Great spot for a quiet meal away from the hassle and hustle
3
Restaurant is in a beautiful spot and the Thai food is very good. When we arrived we tried to order cocktails and were told it would take too long because a group ahead of us had just ordered cocktails- we should order wine or beer. Very odd and not what we were expecting from a top restaurant.
3
We had dinner yesterday night at Tamarind Hill. We chose to sit outdoor. The terrasse is very nice and we enjoyed the atmosphere. Perfect for a romantic dinner. The tables are large and spaced from each other.Food wise, it was good but a bit pricey. We paid SGD 150 for only 1 appetiser, 2 main courses and a glass of wine. It is maybe a detail, but how come charging $5 for 2 small spoon of steamed rice !!But the worse side of this place is the staff. I was expecting a minimum for such a beautiful restaurant, but unfortunately the service was so bad that I’m not sure to go back soon. We can feel we were annoying the guys, just being there. And our waiter was just speaking to my husband, not to me (I don’t know why ?). He barely listen to us and was jumbled with our order (especially with the wine).When we left the restaurant, they just said good bye but on a tone meaning “we are glad you’re leaving”. And I promise, we’ve never been unpleasant at any time.It is a real pity because the place is very beautiful, especially at night with the lightings, and the food is tasty and fine. Hope this kind of review will not discourage clients to come but make the owners realise they have to improve on the quality of service.I wanted to rate "Good" instead of average, but the system doesn't allow and for me it was not "very good" 
1
We went there for a farewell lunch for our colleague and was expecting much more than just a nice setting. We had booked tables and opted for the set meal seeing that we had a big group of 18. From what I could see, we were probably the only customers in the restaurant, and yet our food serving took a long while in coming. Imagine our surprise when the portions turns out to be even smaller than what I usually have from our local hawker centre's mixed rice stall. All the guys were commenting on how "big" the portions are. The only "big portion" was the free flow rice, and even then they took ages to serve that. As expected, nobody was belly-full from the meal. The total bill adds up close to $60 per pax, but it was the one meal nobody was satisfied with
5
We moved to Singapore several months ago and this has been our most memorable meal thus far. The setting is beautiful, we sat outside and thought it was quite special. Cocktails and wine list are top notch and the food is delicious. We loved every dish and we had many of them! Very good service and an excellent evening.
3
For the rather posh decor, the Thai food was not much more than what we get at our local Thai restaurant back in Australia. Our friends treated us but I'm sure the bill was doubled what we pay at our local.
4
Beautiful restaurant in spacious old colonial-style building on a hill. Lovely menu and great Thai/Malay food. Service was a bit scatty but friendly. Good selection of beers as well as wines.
5
We recently dined at Tamarind Hill and highly recommend it. The setting in a beautifully restored black and white colonial house in a tropical park is incredibly romantic. We knew we were onto something special as soon as we approached this exquisite restaurant. Everyone in my party was impressed. The décor is extremely evocative and would be perfect for a romantic dinner. The food and service were great. Try and sit on the covered veranda if it’s not too hot. Slowly whirring fans, a cool white wine in your hand and aromatic aromas from the well prepared dishes – what’s not to like
3
We came here for lunch. Only two tables. Us and another expatriate family with young kids.Huge place with high ceiling set in the Labrador Park. Tastefully decorated in East India company fashion. Is it because of the Christmas/New Year lull plus the inconvenience of transport. Food wise, its passable. Service is good but there's only 2 table of guests. Can they cope if more guests. I would love to come for drinks and dessert and maybe try the evening dinner menu which looks western with thai condiment. He, whom I came for lunch with, and who suggested this place, said he wouldn't come back. Sometimes because of the low turnover of food and customers. Food not fresh.
4
With a Groupon promotion, we had the opportunity to venture off the beaten track to Labrador Park and have Thai fine dining experience in the midst of lush tropical forest and nature park. The restaurant is a few meters walk from the outdoor car park but it was a pleasant stroll away from the hustle and bustle of the concrete jungle. A well decorated Christmas tree greeted us at the entrance and our gaze went upwards to the beautiful high ceiling and wrought iron chandelier. This colonial building is best utilized this way as it is open and spacious. Tables are spaced out nicely and there is adequate privacy while dining. We were pleasantly surprised with the three course grazing menu starting with an interesting plate of three appetizers. This was quite substantial and the main course was pretty ample with garlic rice, pandan chicken, green curry (either beef or chicken), sea bass and steamed vegetables. The green curry was tasty with tender morsels. The fish was well done and everything was well balanced in taste. However the pandan chicken was slightly salty. The sea bass was superb! The final course did not disappoint. It was the Dessert Trio comprising grilled banana, red ruby shooter and sticky mango pudding which were in appropriately small tasting portions. Truly well worth the wait. At the end of the meal, we had a good idea of the standard of cooking and the varieties on the menu. Definitely a lovely afternoon lunch. We enjoyed taking photos of the surroundings and would recommend friends and family to visit as a good alternative to Alkaff Mansion

I with my husband had our dinner on 30.11.2014 to celebrate our 2nd anniversary. I requested them to decorate the table for us little bit and I was so happy to see their arrangements. They decorated our table so romantically. I loved it. Special thanks for this. The ambiance was awesome.Staffs were so friendly .the only thing which bothered us little bit was very limited vegetarian options as we are fully vegetarians.Else every thing was very nice...
5
An old friend surprised me and took me here for dinner last evening. Helen was wonder in helping us to choose from the almost too large menu. Lovely soup, white fish with just the correct amount of chile and a lamb shank with gravy that made me feel as though I was in the Middle East. Very nice elegantly simple dinner.
5
I took my wife to the Tamarind Hill for her birthday, and we took another friend their for their birthday as a result of that. The restaurant is a little off the beaten track, so some cab drivers have a bit of fun finding it, but once you are there, the peace is wonderful - almost no traffic noise at all, and very few people around. On arrival, there are steps up to the huge front door - after dark, they are lit by candles.The restaurant is in an old colonial bungalow, with the central bar area under a vaulted roof set with two huge chandeliers - a spectacular space. Tables are set far enough apart to give an air of intimacy, and the extensive Thai menu has something for everyone. The mixed dessert platter is excellent! :)Although we love the warmth of Singapore, both times we sat inside as we have heard previous reviewers mentioning the mosquitoes in the area, and although we didn't experience any problems going into and out of the restaurant, I can imagine that there would be plenty of them out there. As you might expect, the prices are not cheap, but the food is excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed it both times. The staff are attentive, but not too attentive, and the atmosphere is calm at all times. An ideal place for a romantic dinner for two
4
Went there for a friend's Wedding. Colonial style restaurant surrounded by greenery. Thai food was pretty good. Some with a modern twist. Big bar area and terrace. A bit hard to find because it is located in a park in Pasir Panjang. A good place to dine and to hold event
4
This place is not the kind of place that you just happen upon. It's a stunning old villa you only get to after going to the end of the road; then through the gardens; then up the stairs; and you ask yourself: "is it open?". I first came her for a conference dinner a few years ago and when my sister announced she wanted to come to Singapore to celebrate her fiftieth I thought of this place for dinner. The ambiance is great and the food is excellent. Generally a Thai menu. We tried both the signature curries, the duck, lam shank and tiger prawns in a chilly sauce. Starters were a selection of Thai tasters - so good I could have eaten only that for dinner. Selection of wine was good and reasonable priced. A great place for a special occasion
5
Great restaurant in fantastic setting. We ate outside on the veranda, which I though would be a mistake, but was a great experience. Large table of us and waiters were attentive and food good. No problem to go back next time I am in Singapore
5
The ambience at Tamarind Hill is among the best (if not the best) in Singapore. Surrounded by lush greenery, the well maintained colonial building really impressed us during a romantic date. The interior is impeccable, service quick and food absolutely delicious ! It was fully booked for weddings every Saturday from now till December. As I wandered through lovely wooden deck floors, I could understand why there were so many groups checking out the place to host their events. Groupon currently has a worthy lunch promotion for almost half the price, valid till 14 Dec 2014 if you would to try a delectable selection of appetizers, mains and desserts from this charming place. You may be lucky to get the whole place almost to yourself on a weekday
5
A beautiful setting, with first rate food and excellent (pleasant and unobtrusive) service. We sat outside ...quieter than inside the building.... My husband loved it so much he is looking at the Tamarind boutique resorts. An unexpected treat was Magic Hat beer, made in Vermont where we used to spend a lot of time... This was a Date Night for just the two of us but I shall be booking a table for 8 at the end of the month too! BTW if you want a stroll by the waterfront afterwards, you will have to use a torch.... It is pitch black walking through the trees of Labrador Park! I cannot believe we have lived in SG for 2 years and not tried this ...... I start a lot of sentences like that.... Singapore is full of surprises! I love living here
5
Dined here last night and it was fabulous . Setting is in an old Singaporean black and white colonial house with huge wrap around verandahs .Decor is gorgeous - especially all the light fittings and quirky chandeliers .We ate out on the verandah in delicious solitude overlooking back yard .Service and food were both faultless .Need a cab to get there .Pricey but worth it Highly recommend
3
Location and setting is quite nice. Spacious dining area in and outside. The centre of the house is a nice bar with a stylish atmosphere and a well skilled barkeeper. Good choice of drinks is offered. The design is classy and reduced. The staff is friendly a bit stressed out when busy. The food is rather expensive and is not as good as the scenery. On top if it's bit to expensive. The dishes we had were of good quality and taste but not as extraordinary according to the high price.
5
We arrived at this restaurant about 6.30pm without booking a table, and were told that the whole place was fully booked for that evening. However they had some tables around the back terrace where we were able to sit and enjoy the stylish architecture, lush vegetation and glimpses of the sea through the trees. The cocktails we tried (King of the Hill and Lemongrass Lychee) were delicious and the food was equally so. I was pleasantly surprised to see sticky rice on the menu, which is sometimes hard to find. My only (very small) criticism was that the tofu in my red curry was quite bland tasting and seemed like it had been added to the sauce late in cooking, but the sauce itself was delicious. Staff were attentive and called us a taxi at the end of our meal. The whole place had a lovely atmosphere that made us feel like we could unwind and enjoy taking the evening slowly. I can't wait to return
5
The manageress/host of this restaurant is absolutely lovely. We went as a family of 8 and booked a table outside in the garden area. Was fantastic, can hear all the wildlife. Service was quick friendly and informative with regards to the menu items and food arrived quickly and the presentation was fantastic.I had the soft shell crab as a starter which was beautiful and had the Beef Tenderloin with Foie Gras which was also incredible.Over all a great experience and genuinely the best 2 meals I've ever had in a restaurant before. Keep up the good work
4
My boyfriend brought me to Tamarind Hill for a celebratory dinner. I had never heard of this place before, but was pleasantly surprised when reaching the stairs leading up to the restaurant. It has a very tropical/jungle feel and you are instantly put in a romantic mood. We were greeted warmly by the staff, who were very attentive throughout the dinner. There is a great atmosphere in the restaurant, and you feel very welcome and relaxed.The food was very good, we can recommend the salmon and foies gras as starters. The only complaint is that the staff did not have any knowledge about wine or which selection to recommend. This is perhaps something you expect from a place like this
4
I was invited to diner at tamarin hill by some friends and had a good time. The place is hard to find if you don't know where it is; they are in the natural reserve and are not allowed to put some signs. They are in a very typical black and white building, an old colonial house full of charm. High ceilings, many rooms, old furniture, Buddha statues. We had diner on the terrace despite the threat of mosquitoes, and the staff put some coils on the floor. Their menu is extensive and could be a little shorter in my opinion. I never trust long menus...The food was good and tasty. We had a platter with spring rolls and also a spicy beef salad (not so spicy, but garlicky). Followed by a whole sea bass and rice as well as a chicken curry. The fish was delicious but we had to cut it into filet as the staff disappeared...No desert for us but what they had sounded nice. In general a lovely evening but very empty place and it was super hard to make a reservation as nobody picked up the phone..
5
Having had dinner here, it was a no brainer to choose this place for my recent belated birthday brunch. It was wonderful to discover that they serve a splendid Sunday Brunch feast which was priced reasonably and super value for money!!!!.The location of the restaurant in the lush Labrador Nature Reserve and away from the hustle and bustle noise of the city gives it an ideal step back in time feel. You can even catch a glimpse of the sea on the outside surrounding deck of the restaurant.As I stood at the entrance to receive my 25 guests as they throng up the steps, it almost feels like being the Madame of the mansion! The staff were extremely helpful, courteous and friendly. We were given an entire corner with 2 long tables set up for our party. The place is also kid friendly and my friends' young kids had an enjoyable time playing hide and seek. The service was fabulous. Payment was fast and organized even though we were paying individually (much thanks to one of our waitress Jelly who had a system going which noted down what each diner had!). And although our requests for dishes were fast and many, our servers were efficient in handling our order and were unfazed. The food was awesomely amazing. Kudos to the chef! Our favourite cocktail will always be the lychee lemongrass.My guests and I had a wonderful afternoon, and I would like to thanks Adrian, Jelly and the rest of their team for making my birthday fabulous, fantastic and fun
4
The restaurant is in a very nice mansion located in a park (take your repellent). The place is really nice as well as the food. Service is good as well.
A big expensive for Thai food but great experience.

Beautiful location and tastefully done up inside.Although there is outdoor seating, I would not sit there due to not only the warm weather, but too many insects as the area is wooded.The vegetarian food was really good. The meat dishes, both for starters and main course, were terribly over cooked. Inedible is the term that comes to mind. In fact, the main course was returned to the kitchen.Not particularly over priced either. And that too with a couple of bottles of wine
2
Avoid sitting outside (atleast at night).... as there are lots of small insects (even on tables that you can't see in such dim lights). Decent food & services but "unreasonably priced" . We were obviously wasn't expecting a cheap price but what they charged was no way connected to what was delivered.In short , NOT RECOMMENDED ...especially when you plan to make it special for someone ;

Hard to fault. We had a duck and pork curry respectively and a great NZ Pinot Noir. The food and the service were impeccable. The waiter was very knowledgable about the menu and assisting with our choices. Interesting, the only place in the world that has turned down a tip, insisting it was build into the service charge in addition to the comment "just come back again sometime". We're sure we will
4
Service, venue and food were top notch. as was the wine. Definitely a place to bring a date or a client....however call me a cheapskate, I am used to Thai food being fairly inexpensive so some of the prices for thai dishes made me think twice about ordering Thai......We decided to do fusion and were not disappointed....great food, happy with the choices.Would go back, but only for a special occassion or with a clien

We have recently held our wedding at the Tamarind Hill Restaurant.The staff were attentive to our request and helpful in ensuring that the day went on well.The ambience was spot on for a wedding and it was thoroughly enjoyable.We highly recommend Tamarind Hill to anyone who wants an intimate and chilled out wedding or events.Thanks very much again, Tay Ye

I really loved this restaurant. Housed in an enormous Black and White in Labrador Park it is excellent in design, quality and value. This is surprising for Singapore as one normally gets great design but very little else. The friendly and attentive staff look super cool with great outfits and they get the level of service just right. The food (for my palette) is just sensational. We started with the Tamarind Hill platter which held stunning spring rolls, delicious fish cakes and a type of dumpling that was really, really good. We also had the mango salad which was the best on I have ever had. Serviced with salted salmon flakes rather than dried shrimp it was a lot less spicy than a traditional Thai mango salad but it had everyone fighting for the last spoonful. For main courses we had Beef Massaman (to die for), lamb shank in massaman curry sauce (spicy and with meat that fell perfectly off the bone) and garoupa in a sweet and sour tamarind sauce that worked very well. Mixed vegetables and brown rice were the accompaniment and cooked very well. Price wise I felt the restaurant was great value. The staff made our meal feel like a special occasion and that is something very rare in Singapore. Is it traditional street style Thai? No, of course not. It is very good Hi-So Thai style food made with exceptional ingredients. If you haven't been, then go - you'll enjoy your experience. But you'll have to fight me for a table!

This is one of the most romantic restaurants in Singapore. An old colonial house out of the CBD was packed on a Saturday night enjoying great ambience and wonderful food and wine at very reasonable prices compared to most fine dining in Singapore.Great choices and a great take on Thai that is very creative and very tasty and very reasonably priced. Great service too and there is literally nothing i could have them improve everything was just simple fantastic

Recommended to us by a friend living in Singapore. Make sure you have the address written down as the taxi drivers don't all know it. The setting is lovely amongst the trees and the old black & white building is reminiscent of days gone by. Be sure to request outside seating on the verandah, don't sit inside in the aircon - you can do that anywhere! Crickets singing, gekko's barking, a beautiful evening location. The food is fantastic; we had the platter for two to start and then Groupa and Snapper mains. The portions are very generous and the quality is top-notch, and significantly better value for money than many high-end restaurants in Singapore. The wine list is very good, with something for everyone's price range. The waiting staff are delightful and attentive, maybe a bit shy but lovely. There are so many great places to eat in Singapore, but this one is really memorable. Strongly recommended if you want to change gear one night and go somewhere quiet

We were visitors to Singapore and dined with friends who live there. Gorgeous 'black and white' in quiet green location. Maitre'd welcomed us at the door and already knew I was gluten-free and took good care of my needs. Huge applause for her - she has a wonderful personality and added that little extra touch. Unusual but good cocktail recommendations pre-dinnera and all round solid thai food. Wish we lived in Singapore - we'd be there regularly
5
Shout out to Steeven and Helen! Their service together with the other staff are gracious and full of warmth. Dishes not to miss would be the deep fried soft shell crab, Tom yum soup and green curry chicken. The ambience is beautiful, perfect for a romantic dinner, gathering among friends looking for good food and a place to chat or to celebrate a special occasion!Looking forward to the next visit

Tamarind Hill is one of the first restaurants I went to on my arrival in Singapore.The staff are amazing, so friendly and welcoming, we have become friends and nothing is too much trouble for them. The ambience of the restaurant and its surrounding second to none. Food is delightful and delicious.This is an old colonial house set in the jungle but minutes from the city. I absolutely adore going here and its a real treat

My husband and I had dinner here on a Thursday evening. The restaurant was practically empty which was a shame as it's a gorgeous looking restaurant in an old colonial style building. The service staff was attentive and friendly. We had 1 entree to share and 3 mains, 2 glasses of wine and 2 beers. We thought the food was excellent and tasty although on the more expensive side for Thai food. It cost approximately SG$200 for the both of us.It was a nice meal but would have been better if there was a bit more atmosphere. We felt like we were almost dining alone

The bad, first, because there is a lot more good.1. The food felt a little westernized, kind of Thai-lite. The deep fried grouper with sweet chili sauce, for example, was not a whole fish, and was served in equal sized pieces. My chicken larb was not spicy, and our friend ordered a steak with some foie gras (the fact that it was on the menu at a thai restaurant was a bit strange).2. not bad at all, but Service was a little off (except for the bartender who rocked it, making me a watermelon chili martini to order!), but not bad, just had to wave or motion a few times, but they were mostly on the ball.The Good1. Location and Ambiance - wow, stunning colonial style home with massive green yard, glowing lanterns on long pathway leading to home, we sat outside on a beautiful wooden porch, but inside was drop dead gorgeous, too.2. The bartender made a watermelon chili cocktail to order. Nuff said.3. The appetizer platter was awesome - chef's whimsy, we had shrimp cakes, some kind of rice dumpling with nuts and a few other items, awesomeness.This is a very cool restaurant, great ambiance, you feel like you are in the jungle of thailand somewhere, not in Singapore. Very private, romantic. Will go back with my fiancee and also for biz meetings
4
I am a big fan of Thai food but I have always struggled to find a good place in Singapore! However now the search is over, this will certainly become my new 'go to' place. The food was excellent and set in the lush greenery of Labrador park makes it the perfect evening getaway
4
We came here for Saturday lunch on a recommendation from a friend and were not disappointed. The setting is peaceful and beautiful and yet still easily accessible from the city. The food is authentic tasting and delicious with generous portions sizes. A wonderful way to spend a lazy weekend lunch
5
I was truly taken back when a colleague took me here. The building is in the middle of a jungle (so it would seem) but not very far from the city. Such a beautiful venue for a restaurant, is the first impression.Singapore suffers a lot from bad service. But this place is an exception. And finally the food - very authentic and spicy (at my request). Will definitely come back
5
A beautifully decorated hilltop restaurant a few minutes by taxi out of the downtown area.Authentically cooked and prepared Thai food, as spicy as you request, lovingly prepared and presented.Good for a romantic dinner out on the terrace enjoying the view, or a party or corporate event in one of the several private dining rooms inside.If you are looking for good Thai food in Singapore, you should not be disappointed

The restaurant is located in a beautiful colonial style building amidst the jungle greenery of Labrador Park. We arrived after dark and were shown our table on the verandah. As my husband smokes we were at the opposite end to the other diners and had a section all to ourselves, this would have been fine but being alone made it lack ambiance a little. However that's our fault and we could have sat with the other diners if my husband didnt smoke! We had just ordered when I felt a thud on my back, I though a gecko had dropped from the ceiling but no... It was a frog! It jumped over my husbands head and landed on the floor the other side of the table. The maitre d was great, she explained there were frogs and asked if we wanted to move inside, we declined and spent the rest of the evening frog watching :) the food was superb.. I love this place and would recommend for a romantic dinner. The inside of the restaurant is equally as elegant as the verandah and I think if we had been at the busier end of the restaurant we may not have encountered so many frogs

My husband and I were invited for an event here, so I cannot comment on the prices, unfortunately.Ambience: This was quaint, as the restaurant rests on the top of a small hill, ample space, and in a converted colonial house. Design complemented the surroundings, and because we went at night, the lights of course made everything quite magical.Food: This is where the mediocrity was. With a five star setting, the food was definitely not five star. A shame. This restaurant serves fusion Thai. I've had better. Service: Service was good. Would I go back to this restaurant? Probably not too soon. Perhaps for a special occasion. Then again, there are so many good restaurants in Singapore. I am not sure if I want to go back just for the ambience....
4
On that day, the KL chef was there supervising the kitchen. The food/ambience - at par with the one in KL. Now, if one is relying on taxi...well, this could be a real challenge. Print out a map in hand!!!

Tamarind has a magical colonial setting in a 19th century hilltop black and white mansion. Food was delicious, must be one of the top Thai places in Spore. All furniture is made by Thai hill tribes. Highly recommend the experience, we will go back.

I was back after my first visit in January 2013. In January, this was a newly opened restaurant and we would forgive many of the issues as they were still going through teething period. The service remained mediocre. Serving staff appeared unmotivated and were just doing their job serving with no desire to delight their customer. Our ordering staff rushed through order taking with no desire to explain the menu adequately to help us order the right dishes. All these were fine if this was a fast food outlet but not for such an elegant grand restaurant, We had a poor dining experience. We sincerely wish them continue improvement and to become an excellent all round dining GEM one day
5
What a fantastic restaurant! The old colonial house is surrounded by beautiful green nature. If you chose to eat on the terrace and hear the sounds of nature you forget that you are still in Singapore.The wine list offers many great choices, just like the food menu. The food was absolutely delicious and served in a beautiful way. For starters we shared salmon loin cubes which pretty much melted in our mouths and we also shared tiger prawns wrapped in smoked salmon which was really nicely fresh. In both dishes the Thai spices used made such wonderful combinations, really special.As a main course we ordered a whole sea bass steamed in garlic, ginger, lemongrass, lime juice, etc in typical Thai style, really superb. We ordered some morning glory as a side which was just what you expect and the only dish that was nothing special. We were too full to experiment with desserts. The service is good and I like that there was good time in between the courses so it really was a night out. The other great things is that there is a lot of space between the tables so you really can enjoy a private experience. It helps that the restaurant does not welcome young children.This was our first time which will be followed by many more

The ambiance and general setting are the big selling points here. I came here recently for dinner with some friends, then again later for a wedding reception. Both of these occasions were momorable, but totally different. The tables are nicely spread out, so unless completely full, the place doesn't look busy and you are not forced to listen to the next table's conversation. This does make for a peaceful dining experience. When we visited as a small group, we chose the terrace outside, where on a weekday, we were the only table. This was wonderful, enjoying some food and a chilled glass of wine surrounded by nature and the sounds of the "jungle" at night. The food is nominally Thai, although has been moderated for Singaporean tastes. If you want an authentic (hotter) level of spice, then you need to tell the chef. Some of the food items are execellent, such as the duck red curry and some of the appetizers, Others, such as a beef curry and some fish in a tamarind sauce were not that great. However, it is the atmosphere that is the overall winner.On the other occasion, we took over the whole venue for an evening wedding reception. All the elements of a classic reception were there, but in this historic and picturesque setting. I have been to a few weddings held in hotels, but this takes it to another level. It's simple really, where would you prefer to celebrare tying the knot with the love of your life? In a faceless hotel ballroom, or in a beautifully restored colonial era house surrounded by nature? I haven't been here for brunch, but I look forward to doing that another time
4
Restaurant ambiance is stunning. Service is very good, although waiters are still learning the dishes. The menu is VERY long, so whatever Thai dish you like to eat, you'll find it. There were many wines by the glass offered, but that's not why you come here, come here for wonderful ambiance and romantic setting in midst of Labrador Nature Preserve
5
Nature enclave in busy singapore. Superb black and white house.Week days, not many people, service was very good very attentive. Food was great and original. Wine list ok with reasonable prices.They use recycle material, have plates hand made by orang hasli in malaysia. Eco friendly place.Great for a wedding, reception, and a romantic dinner. Portions of main courses are huge. The chef waggyu foie gras with green curry reduction works very well. I asked to change the waggyu with tenderloin cause i thought i would be too rich, and it was perfect. Manager is very nice welcome guests and said goodbye, and spent time explaining to us the origin of the house and their eco concept. I dont agree with comments mentionning it is soulless... It is quiet for sure but has lots of charm.Highly recommended

Tamarind Hill was the chosen destination to celebrate my birthday this year for Sunday brunch, and we were not disappointed. We were a large group of 26 split over two tables. On arrival the free-flow began with cocktails and wine before we sat down. The staff were incredibly helpful. In fact, I'll go out on a limb, they were the most helpful and professional f&b staff I've encountered in Singapore. They managed the large group well, and looked after our needs. It was a Thai a la carte buffet (cold buffet and selection of mains from menu), which was really tasty. The cold starters were great, followed by Tom yum, which was too spicy for me but others enjoyed it. We then had a selection of mains and accompaniments. When a dish ran out the servers were on hand to take an extra order or remove empty plates. The only difficulty we had was that the bar closed at 3pm, even though it was advertised for a post-brunch drink, to stay back and have a cocktail in the surroundings. This was achieved after some negotiation and pointing to the advertisement. Even though there was this teething issue, the staff were reasonable and sorted it out in an amicable way. It is set in a truly well refurbished colonial "black-and-white" house in Singapore, and while brunches can set you back a bit, this one was worth it for a special occasion. The staff were able to cope with a mix of free-flowers and non-alcoholic brunches, which made for smooth sailing. They also managed the bill well at the end allowing people to pay in smaller numbers than the whole table which made everything much more pleasant. Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable brunch and I will definitely be going back. The first time I've said it and meant it for a Singapore brunch

I was actually quite excited about this one after reading some reviews online. The walk up the hill to the building seemed promising and the old building looks magical from far away. Unluckily, what welcomed us on the premises was a rat. However I tried to forget that in order to enjoy this evening. The restaurant was quite empty, maybe just two more tables. Tables are scattered in different rooms and corners of the rooms with very little light, which gave it an odd atmosphere. As if there was something to hide. Service was ok, but not overly helpful. Bottom line, we did not feel comfortable to begin with. We then ordered starters first. A papaya salad and a seafood bisque. The papaya salad was well below expectations, completely underseasoned. The bisque was just ok. So we decided not to spend any more money at this place and did not order any main courses. Maybe it was just a bad day, but I would definitely not go back to this place. It feels like they are trying to be fancy and exclusive, but actually they are not. And too little light cannot hide that

I had a strong impression of the place when i was searching for an "out-of-box" Wedding Venue we want to hold in June this year...My husband and I went to recee Tamarind Hill and we totally fell in love with it...We set it in our hearts that this is gonna be the place. No other restaurants/hotels then was never in our list!It had such a beautiful fusion of asian and westernised ambience created from the entrance to the whole interior, furnitures, lighting etc to the Alfresco section. Of course not to forget, my favourite was the Chandliers at the Bar counter area:) Living up to its standards - we were very pleased with the customer service of all the servers and definitely, Adrian who assisted us alot in the whole preparation to make it a very smooth flow event and catering to our needs and requirements. The cuisines presented and taste of food was great (our guests kept giving us good reviews of it :) One of our guest told us that "it was the best wedding ever!"Try it to experience it yourself :)We'll be back again Tamarind Hill, you left a beautiful experience in our hearts and Thank you!
5
The restaurant goes on my list of great places in Singapore that I will be recommending to friends. It's a bit pricey, but still within reason for what you get.Really good Thai food and wonderful atmosphere, absolutely beautiful setting and location.The restaurant doesn't need a long review. It is good, go and try it

When my wife and I first chanced upon this place, we decided almost immediately to have our wedding carnival here. Private, cozy and romantic were the first words that will come to anyone's mind. Our wedding carnival was above expectations. The immaculate service and the impressive thai-fusioned food was well received by everyone. Some of my friends returned the following week to try out other food on the menu. On a cool evening, I recommend that you should try sitting at the outdoor portion of the restaurant, which is really romantic and different. Although it is situated pretty close to town, you will not experience any sort of noise and crazy lights from the busy shopping malls. I've tried the ala carte food on a separate occasion and fell in love with the kaffar lime flavoured rice and the green curry chicken. The restaurant manager Steven and his staff were always around whenever you needed something. I will also recommend this place for product launches or cocktail receptions.Big thanks to Adrian who coordinated my entire wedding preparations and was very professional and careful with lots of attention to detail. Will be back

I and My wife recently held our wedding reception at the Tamarind Hills. There is so much to write about the place itself but to put in simply, it is absolutely stunning. The service offered right from the time the guests walked in to the restaurant till the time they made their way back home was immaculate and very pleasant. The cocktails served to us was great with attention to detail. The food served was sumptuous and very tasty. Adrian and his whole team did a fantastic job of making sure that our wedding reception went off without a glitch and it was great to see everyone rave about the place even days after the wedding!!!! Thanks a lot TA for a great job and a very special memory...We will be back soon...AK & S

Made an reservation for 2 at this hilltop place with date.Very nice ambient but what was excellent was the service. Was meet at the door by one of the staff name Ah Kiong? Who found a got table for us, recommended the food, which is a first to have a 3 course thai cuisine. Also recommend glass of wine for each course of the food. Very good service
2
Atmosphere on arriving was great. Stunning setting, lighting and internal decor. Greetings by staff all v good too. We ordered the platter, fish cakes and spring rolls as starters. Starters on the whole were good but nothing to write home about. Then our main course arrived: soft shell crab curry, duck curry, crispy duck and 2 sides + rice. Everything was lukewarm and to be frank pretty tasteless. The waiters took our food away on complaining and promised fresh, hot plates. Second time around was a bit better but still the food was tepid. The head waiter said that the food is served cold if the dishes take different amounts of time to cook! I did not have the energy to point out how ridiculous that was! Best thing about this restaurant is the atmosphere, but don't expect a first rate Thai meal...
4
I had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while and it lived up to all my expectations! The restaurant is a gorgeous bungalow perched atop a hill and getting here by public transport would be a bit difficult but once you do, you'll be glad you did. We were given a lemongrass welcome drink before being shown to our table where the wait staff continued to impress with their knowledge of the food and menu as well as service. No problems with their recommendations - try the red curry duck with grapes and lychee as well as the grilled pork neck. The asparagus with prawn paste was also tasty. The cod loin sounded interesting ( and was yummy ) but was not very value for money as it turned out to be two small pieces of battered cod for $38. The place is lit p with candles outside after dark and very romantic! An excellent place for a date or special occasion
5
We went in Tamarind Hill twice and loved the overall atmosphere of this beautifull black & white house. We really enjoyed the food as well, discovering Thai dishes. The set of sarters for 2 persons is really good, and we especially loved the soups and fishes we tasted.Average bill for 2 persons without wine is about 170 SGD
3
Had my dinner tamarind hill. Atmosphere was mind blowing and I was greeted like a VIP by the staff. Being greeted by every single staff whom I walked past. Had a great welcome drink and then it went downhill. Food was utterly disgusting. Any dish with seafood had a bad odour and I clearly understood it was not fresh. Fish dishes were all fillet and nothing in the menu had a whole fish which was sad due to the nature of Thai seafood. Overly priced and disgusting food is my overview.
5
We went along on a Sunday night, and by 9 o'clock were the only people in the restaurant. We were sat in the outside dining area, which is very smart, but less formal than indoors. We ordered a good variety of dishes, but I was most taken with the mint and apple herb rolls. It sounds odd, but it's a great combination of different flavours. The service was good. They were always close by, but not too close, and not in a hurry to close up as we were the only customers left

for the celebration of my girlfriends birthday and her twin sister who was in town, i made a reservation at Tamarind Hill. during the process of making this reservation i mentioned that it was a double birthday, which normally is enough "signal" for a restaurant to make it special.Arriving at the restaurant, our reservation was not known (not something you want to have when you are celebrating) but thankfully they had a table available after a 30min wait. unfortunately it took also 30 minutes before we got our cocktails served so the start was disappointingThe lack of good service was unfortunately an eminent part of the evening, and even the good quality of the food did not let us leave with satisfactio
5
Great dinner at Tamarind Hill! Service, food and location was first class. Felt like we had been transported to Thailand. We will be back and recommend to our friends.
5
Great place to meet family or friends. It is a wonderful place to enjoy a nice evening or Sun brunch.Probably one of the best Thai fusion in town in a stunning property which provides a heavenly like ambient. Still not that popular which is a plus since it is never easy to find a quiet place in Singapore
5
the service was excellent, as was the food. the tomyam soup that they serve was extremely well prepared. im sure lots of people hate getting their hands dirty when eating, especially in a restaurant, so at tamarind hill it's great because the prawns are prepared in a way that is easy for you to deshell it without much effort, allowing you to keep your hands clean. all the food i tried was fantastic. dessert is amazing too. i wasnt a fan of their alcohol drinks - but maybe that's just me being unadventurous with alcohol. they do have a wide variety available with very interesting concoctions!if you do select to have your meal outdoors, i would suggest that you ask them to burn some mosquito coil for you as that was the only annoying thing about my time there. otherwise, choose to sit indoors if possible and you wont have this problem altogether
5
what a wonderful surprise.....this colonial building was HUGE with amazing lights (photo attached). The service was very good for Singapore and the food was amazing (but not the pineapple curry with seafood - very watery). It was expensive but hey what isn't these days - you get what you pay for...loved this place.OUR waiter was experienced and charming - we could not fault the service - and we are fussy about it..
5
We had a wonderful meal yesterday. We found the food the best Thai fusion we have had, with an incredible menu which made it difficult to choose. Their duck red curry amazing. Setting is out of a luxury colonial film set and the service was just righ

Lots of good comments on this stunning property and I agree that it is one of the rare jewel in Singapore in terms of ambient. Kitchen is helm by chef Thiti Thammanatr and I was told he had cooked for Bill Clinton and Chow Yun Fat. The food was indeed very good. I was also very impressed with the wine list which was thoughtfully put together that blend well with Thai food and at reasonable price. Sadly, with such wonderful combination of ambient and food standard, my dinning experience was bland, dull and disjointed. Server staff tried hard but they simply lack the service aptitude to complete the icing. The service quality is good for a fast food restaurant but total mismatch for his grand setup. It badly need to upgrade its serving team and instill some soul into this beautiful restaurant. The kind of friendly, charming, knowledgeable and efficient service passion that we find in Ristorante Da Valentino
3
The ambience at Tamarind hill is truly beautiful . it does not feel like you are in a bustling city like singapore. However, the food was very average. Given the hype of this restaurant and the fact you need to wait a amonth to get a reservation, I expected a more authentic experience but that was sadly lacking
3
Tamarind Hill was previously home to a Chinese Restaurant but now is home to Thai Restaurant, Samadhi. Only good thing is the ambience - like eating in a lodge within a forest. A good place for private gathering if food is not top priority. This was a return trip to Tamarind Hill for an event but first time since it became a Thai restaurant. The staff were polite but not anticipatory like asking guests if they want drink when sitting down. The food was average in taste and presentation. Not sure if it's due to 'mass production' of food because there were over 40 "seated" guests at the event. The wine (a Pinot Noir) was average. Since it's an event, I don't know the price so unable to comment on the value of the planned menu. Ample car parking spaces within compound and also just before entrance to compound
4
We have just eaten our second meal at Tamarind Hill. The arrival at dusk to the candlelit walkway is an impressive arrival for visitors. We booked a table on the terrace but being a week day evening we were the only customers to eat out there and was just like having a private restaurant. We found the starters to be a little sparce on our first visit so skipped these this time. The Masaman curry is amazing, the meat is so succulant and there is a perfect balance of flavours. The lemongrass rice is a perfect compliment to the curry. We also ordered the red snapper fillet and the salted egg prawns which were equally as good. For desert the tamarind platter was a little dissapointing but only because we found we are not overly keen on Thai set deserts. The rum and raisen ice cream with bannana fritters was a winner with my family. The service was prompt in bringing the food, the only issue was there was one younger member of staff who was hanging around who had to get another member of staff everytime you wanted to order a drink or turn the lights up so you could read the menu... over all we will be back for the food and the venue

Went with 2 friends to check out this place for a friend's upcoming 50th birthday celebration. The reviews and photography made this place look promising but alas we were quite disappointed, really. The interior deco was very sparse, to the point of minimalist. I must add that the website photography was overly touched up, creating some expectations. The place felt very dim. The bar was empty and the service staff made no attempt to ask if we would like Pre dinner drinks. In fact, when we left 2 hours later, the bar was still empty. Service was lacking in attention and below par. Asked for refill of water 2 times, but they were not busy on a on day evening, just maybe 5 occupied tables and about 6 staff. We asked the staff what's Tom yum martini like and his response was "oh, just cold Tom yum in a martini glass". We then asked about the yellow curry and he said "its like a soup". Definitely some training is needed here to better promote the dishes. Menu was not extensive but had enough choices. The green curry with grilled chicken was very good, best dish of the evening. Soft shell crab was tasty, as was duck with lychee salad. But the sautÃ©ed squid with garlic chips was very ordinary, and had no garlic chips. Dessert was absolute let down. Don't even bother to order Mano with sticky rice. Rice was hard and chewy, perhaps becos it was brown sticky rice but that is a wrong choice of rice then! We order the "tamarind sundae" and was eagerly awaiting to try something different. Imagine our disappointment to be served a banana split style Choc, strawberry, vanilla ice cream minus the bananas! I think they can be more specific on the menu or at least the service staff could have educated us about our choice. Bill for 3 of us came up to $187. I thought it was daylight robbery to be charging $4 for a serving of rice. Needless to say, we won't be repeat customers
