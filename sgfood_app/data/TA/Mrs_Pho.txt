You can get nice pho and other soup dishes. The location is also quite nice. Many locales as we’ve been there.
5
This place serves good decent Vietnamese food. The soup is full of flavor. Pork chop is grilled to perfection.
5
Located along beach road and opposite Concourse building, this Vietnamese store serve authentic Vietnamese street foods such as Pho, spring roll both fried and non fried version. Great place for a quick lunch or dinner!

I called before going as I had few questions since it was my first visit and the girl was very quick to hang up the phone.The place is really small with small tables and stools. Interesting decor interiorly. The waitress wasn't the most talkative or nicest esp that this is my first visit here.You write your order on paper then they come pick it up. It took very little time to get my food.I decided to go with the suggestions online and ordered the Beef Pho and I also got the spring rolls.The Pho was good...i wished they had other condiments on the table that is typical at Vietnamese restaurants...some of the chili they had was too unbearable...and I like spicy food.Spring rolls were good but very small in size. Not typical size.The other thing I didn't like is they charge for a wet napkin And there's no napkin/tissue at the table either? I had to go to bathroom and get toilet paper to be able to wipe my mouth and wipe my fingers.The price can't be beat...of all the places I've gone so far in Singapore.Def a place to try out...

This wasn't the place that we travelled across SG to eat at - it was closed and this was nearby. Going from good to bad, prices were reasonable, service a bit too relaxed and ambiguous, and the food very hum-drum. The beef noodles dish I had was luke-warm, the meat was chewy and not very tasty. The yoghurt drink was just yoghurt in a glass with ice. Once here was plenty
5
As soon as you walk in you have the sense of discovering a small part of Viet Nam. The tables are full and close; there are electrical wires looping along the wall; diners are coming and going and when we sat down the person next to us was so positive about their experience and the meal. The meals come very quick and are tasty, could perhaps more fresh herbs but I enjoyed the spring rolls, chicken wings and the Pho! The prices are amazingly good for Singapore and with no alcohol served you are there for the food and service which is excellent and the tables turn quickly
4
The food was really good and authentic. We had the beef pho, lemongrass chicken rice, dry vermicelli as mains. They were authentic, tender beef, well marinated chicken and very good sauce. We also had the spring rolls and fried chicken. The spring rolls were ok. Not too thick and the sauce was good. The fried chicken was a little hard and kinda stale. It wasn''t the cheapest and the place is kinda small but very highly recommended
3
My first virgin dining at Mrs Pho. The store is cosy and has a nice ambience but extremely squeezy bcos how the table is lined up so close to one another. Service was another bad point. Food was not too bad. Would give it another chance to to revisit
3
Went to this shack with the officemates of my wife when I went to singapore. Two of the coworkers were Vietnamese and they highly recommended this place, so i figured, it must be really good.We went to the Bugis branch and ordered the house specialty noodles, the springroll, and the fried chicken. the food was great, especially the chicken and the dips. very much recommended.the ambiance of the place was really nice, seemingly authentic resembling a local food stall in vietnam
3
The food and the service fell short of expectations. A few years ago, I travelled Vietnam for 3 months and loved the food so I was looking forward to evoking those fond memories. Sadly, the spring rolls, the papaya salad, the beef pho and the chopped chicken and rice failed to ignite a spark. It was a reasonable meal at a reasonable price in a pleasant enough setting but, when eating out, I'm looking for a bang not a fizzle
4
Is hard to find nice pho in Singapore, this restaurant can consider the TOP 3 nice Vietnam food in Singapore. Especially their chicken pho is one of my favourite.
5
Really yummy pho, food service was really fast too. Spring rolls were good, fried one was more average. Though the restaurant is quite small. They also only accept cash.
5
Food here are great! It's like east meets west! I always love Vietnam food especially deep fried roll and the pork chop.
5
Last night my first visit in this Restaurant... authentic food, fast service, lovely ambience. Prices very reasonable and sure i will come back
Highly recommend
5
I am a frequent visitor of Mrs Pho and haven't been disappointed once. I love the authentic Pho, the Bun Bo Hue along with an avocado smoothie. It's absolutely delicious, would recommend it anytime!
4
The chicken wings with fish sauce is a MUST TRY. The combination pho is a bowl filled with goodness. Vietnamese iced coffee is awesome. The restaurant is rather small and the seatings are very close apart. A quick eat and go dining option.
1
We intentionally brought our friend to Mrs Pho quite often because we enjoyed the food here and recommended to our friend who new here. But today we all encountered a very bad service. And right from the start when we came in, this man who served us wasn't very friendly and he was very rude constantly to us whether is before or after we ordered the meal. He also gave us wrong ordered (they changed to the right item afterward) and he talked rude to us which make a us here very unpleasant. It's quite annoying when we received this treatment repeatedly during this meal. I hope it won't happen next round again.

This place has almost reached cult status with Singaporeans; it often runs out of phở in the late afternoon/early evening, so we wanted to try it out. The phở broth is pretty flavourful, but it is NOT served piping hot as it should be; the 'special' version only has beef brisket and beef balls, but no raw beef or tripes; and the beef brisket is rather chewy. The mini clams are cooked with a delightful garlic sauce and served with sinful but scrumptious lard. The chicken wings are below average. Venturing to the toilet shows how unhygienic part of the back section is. Next time, we would try newly-opened Phở Cô Hai Bánh Mì on the same block of Beach Road. Or stick to Long Phụng in Joo Chiat which is much better, more authentic and with a more diverse, longer menu
4
recently dropped in for a quick bowl of Pho at the weekend. decent quality , hugely popular with a young / student crowd .. need to get there early. the place is quite packed with small tables, and it isnt a place to linger ... but pretty good for quick vietnamese food.
4
Trip advisor you have come through again. Outstanding meal served quickly and at a great price. This restaurant is a small venue but it's seating is not to tight and it's comfortable. The service was good but the meals were the standout. Papaya Salad starter, Beef Pho main and Vietnamese Iced coffee to finish. I'll definitely come back if I stop over again.
5
My wife and I visit Mrs Pho its always a pleasure to say their outstanding food. Its fast, efficient and simply hits the spot overtime we dine...............
Staff super friendly and helpful.
5
Mrs Pho is a great place to get a tasty meal that's quick, healthy and great value. Every mouthful is really fresh and flavoursome.
5
We asked Google Map the location of Vietnamese Restaurants and selected this 4.5/5 Star rated one.
To my astonishment, this is probably the best in Singapore.
Highly recommended.
4
Food is amazing...a must !! Service is ok but worth the downside ;) Owner seemed a good guy....would come back for sure !!
5
The food was very good and full of flavor. We tried 4 dishes which were all nice and the drinks too. The service was also good and fast. The atmosphere is also nice, with tables and chair like in Vietnam. Definitely a must try, in a good neighborhood and affordable (around 8-9$ for a dish
3
This place has no service. They're constantly speaking to themselves in Vietnamese maybe (might be a sign of authenticity but they really don't like serving customers and missed the order. Nothing like extreme rudeness but they just zone out the whole time.Food is ok but not the best pho I have had. I personally thinks the one at Tanglin Mall food court is not bad. This place is reasonably priced.Warning: the spices are very hot. *it is not easy to find parking nearby.
5
It is located right outside the hostel I was staying in, so I spent my last meal of my trip here. It is visible on Google map so it made an impression on me. The restaurant is small but serves really great food. I went in just a little bit earlier than lunch hour. It was really full then and people queued outside waiting to be seated. The food are not pricey and tasted really great
4
Avoid lunch hour as it is always packed with people who work in the area. Menu and order chit are on your table, select what you want and pass the chit to the staff. As i went past lunch hour, i got my beef pho under 5min. i love to do my own concoction of chili (spicy!), lime and the brown sauce dip. Pho is served pipping hot, the light broth is easy on the palate and the next thing i knew, i have cleaned up the entire bowl. Do not expect restaurant standard of service here
3
busy lunch with a friend. the place is obviously a hot spot for the offices around and was solid packed on Monday noon when we left.boils down to a decent eatery. not much more. i recall Pho at a vietanamese friend's place in France which is a broth with noodles and meat, yey was served with a wide choices of herbs and chili to make the real flavory thing. no such option at Mrs Pho whose Pho remains a thin broth. from all our choices i guess only the pork meat balls were with some real flavor.their salty lemonade is interesting too.price is OK. service rather minimum, but all in all this is a lunch box. so overall OK. not overwhelming
5
This place is just across the road from me and the wife & I go at least once a week.Great authentic Pho, good spring rolls and absolutely totally moreish meatballs.Also recommend their Bun Thit.This is a quick eat and piss off venue which is verging on hipster. Not somewhere to take someone on a date if your looking to linger over a bottle of wine.Only thing I can fault is that you don't have the basket of herbs & beansprouts at the table as you would get in Vietnam.Recommended if you are into pretty authentic Vietnamese pho
4
Mrs Pho at 349 Beach Road is a very traditional Vietnamese Food. Prices are reasonable but the place is small.
4
Was there twice. Food are amazing but their closing time is too rush until kinda rush clients to finish their food asap.
5
Have been in Singapore for the week with my wife holidaying . Mrs Pho came recommended to us both and we were so ecstatic to get there for dinner. Amazing meatballs, spring rolls, beef and chicken pho. Loved the chilli jam on the table so much we must come back for more. Very quaint setting, great service and worth the short wait at the door. Comes highly recommended and I can see why. No doubt we will recommend to our friends that travel to Singapore frequently. Clearly this is a local favourite. In a city where there is so much competition, Mrs Pho star on dinner menu.Back tonight for a second sitting ✔️✔
5
A tiny place along beach road that serves excellent pho and genuine Vietnamese food. The pho is so good and the broth is heavenly. Efficient and fast and clean with comfortable air conditioning. Got to beat the office lunch crowd and it gets extremely crowded between 12-2 pm. The furniture arrangement reminds one of those in Vietnam and every bowl of pho is consistently delicious and comforting. If you love pho, Mrs Pho is it.
2
They are doing good business for sure, i come here very often - sometimes 3 times a week. Recently their Bun Bo Hue is getting super oily and too spicy that I couldn't eat; I mentioned it to the staff they did not care and still charged me while I ordered something else. Clearly they don't care much about loyalty
5
Small place and the interior gives a nice rustic feel. I ordered the dry vermicelli with bbq pork and spring rolls. When I poured the sauce in and mixed it all up, it was very tasty! Missing lots lots lots more basil and greens haha. And was hoping for some rice paper but you're supposed to eat it off the bowl.I asked for more basil. Should have said, give me 3 times more basil! Haha.I'm definitely coming back to try the beef pho soup and seems like their stir fry pho is also a speciality.Very nice. Easier to seat if smaller groups so be prepared to wait if you have a big group (more than 4)
3
Food was good but definitely no wow factor worthy of any mention (especially at that kind of price). There is nothing too exceptional or unique about their food that you can't find in other Viet restaurants in Singapore. Their prices are definitely on the high side considering the food is nothing exceptional, albeit good. Do a bit of research and you will find similar Viet food at a more reasonable price. I wouldn't recommend as your top choices. If you are in the vicinity, there are definitely other better options to go for
5
I'm usually skeptical when a Vietnamese restaurant looks too done up as it usually means that the food isn't as authentic. However this place absolutely surprised me. We ordered the chicken glass noodle soup and the beef stew soup and both were very good! The soups tasted just like home cooked meals by my parents! On top of that they were a very reasonable price too in cool environment. Highly recommended!
4
Hard to find good Vietnamese restaurant in singapore, this was surprisingly good. On Beach Road next to a dodgy looking spa, good quality pho, some msg but manageable, fresh spring rolls good, fried so so. Banh Chnoh was not freshly made but good enough. Sauces a little heavier than should be to cater for local tastes but all the condiments there as they should. Good Vietnamese coffee. Fast n furious service, cannot complain. New Favourite for Vietnamese food in singapore
2
Due to the hipster of this place that I had heard from many of my friends, I decided to visit this place to try their beef noodles. I find their beef noodles was too oily & was not as good as the reviews that I saw. I would not recommend this place to my friends if they want try beef ph
3
Great food, terrible service, the place is so crowded, price is cheap for a restaurant in Singapore, will come back for the food :)
4
They are fast and it's quite cheap. The waiters don't speak great english so don't expect any recommendations. We enjoyed our food especially the green mango and the homemade lemonade!
4
Being my second visit here, we tried the pork chop rice and Vietnamese coffee. LOVE THEM! Note: the portion for the sliced beef pho is big. Hence it's very worth it. Two thumbs up. I am so coming back again.
5
Been here many times. I just returned from Saigon, and the first place I went to (because I missed Saigon so much) was here. Highly recommend any Pho, the meatballs, and Bun Bo Hue. Coffee is amazing.
4
The food was delicious here. Hands down the special beef pho cured my hangover after thirsty Thursday and ladies night at Kyo. However I have one beef with this place (pun intended). I got here around 11:30 am so was able to beat the lunch rush and the food came out in 5 minutes. I like to add lots of chili and hot sauce so that generally causes anyone's sinuses to start flowing... When I asked for napkins, they actually refused to give me any (-1 star). I was honestly so shocked because what restaurant doesn't give out napkins??? I ended up having to pay the 30 cents for the wet wipe when all I had to do was dry my nose. Very perplexing!Overall I'd still come back for the food but now I know to BYON (bring your own napkins).
3
The place itself is quite nice, the food came out quick and was alright. Ordered the brisket pho which was ok but the brisket was too thin for me. Spring rolls nice and fresh. The service on the other hand seemed not very happy to work at all. But if you want that big tip jar on your counter full this is not the way guys
3
The place was really funky to sit in and to order you have a pad of cards, using a checklist system to select your meals.Food was amazing, fresh and was pretty cheap i think for SG.The staff were either not motivated or just plane rude. We got sat and had to wait a while on a non-busy day. And we finally had to wave the girl over to come and serve us.We ordered off the checklist, waited, food came and we ate; but at the end we felt like some Vietnamese coffees and once again no one wanted to serve us!!!If the staff were nicer I would have given 5/
5
Our family when to Mrs Pho for a quick lunch and really enjoyed the whole experience, great Pho, and appetisers. The chicken pho and combination pho were excellent. Fresh spring rolls and mango salad were delicious.Prices and portions were good.It's a small place with basic metal tables and chairs, not for seating long sessions. Highly recommend and would come back with family again
5
Bustling on a Thursday night. Managed to get a table for two. Tiny tables, challenging to fit all our food. That said, everything else was great! Delicious pho dac biet served with a lightly poached egg, shredded herbs and lots of beef($9.90). Pork chop rice ($8.90) was also very tasty, as were the Hanoi pork balls ($3.90) and fresh spring rolls ($3.90). Also tried the salty lemonade. Will be back to try the garlic cockles next. Located near Arab street, and Haji Lane. Nearest mrt station is Bugis.
5
I have family living on beach road and every time I visit we go here. It's always busy and the food is great. Freshly made and tasty. You order by ticking boxes on the little paper menu, avoiding any confusion. You can also get takeaway. The spring rolls with peanut dip are fab as is the papaya salad with pork and prawn
4
Whilst they don't promote anything vegan they are happy to accomodate. We had the vermicelli salad and the rice paper rolls. They don't have tofu but the salads were really nice and fresh with some soy and peanut sauce. Very fast service and nice people
4
Nice and cozy restaurant. Be prepared to queue during the weekends. Besides the pho, the garlic cockles is highly recommended!
4
My family and I are foodies. It is difficult to find good and authentic Vietnamese food in Singapore. Mrs Pho is now our favorite viet haunt whenever we crave for a good, hearty viet meal. Waiting time can be about 30min to an hour depending on crowd as the restaurant has limited seating and the tables are small. The appetizers fill up the small table very quickly one takes too much time to eat
5
Staying near Mrs Pho's place and every time I have walked past it is full, that is always a good sign to me. But when I read the reviews here on Trip, I wasn't so sure. So I wandered past again, and as usual, it was full so I entered. Delicious is my take. Very good, efficient service, lots of choice on the menu. You tick what you want on a sheet and your order is taken away. Tables were clean and reading with eaten equipment western and asian along with condiments and wet wipes. The food was really tasty and nothing to fault here - top marks
2
I live across the road and eat here almost once a fortnight. It's cheap and usually easy, food not too bad also. The issue is the service is horrible (and not just tonight!). I arrived at 9.33 PM, service stops at 9.30 pm to for take away. I asked if there was anything the kitchen could do for me and they didn't give a hoot. Told them I'm local, I'm there every fortnight but it didn't make a lick of difference. Pretty sad when a little customer service would go along way. Sorry Mrs Pho... you've lost a loyal customer. I get you don't need the business as you are always busy, but this sends a really bad message to your loyal patrons.
1
Food is good but service and politeness of staff is terrible. My last time. We asked to sit at a bigger table as we will order a lot, but one lady refused (there were plenty of empty tables) worst of all they spoke in Vietnamese very badly about us unfortunately for them I understand everything. You can't address your clients that way in a service business. A manager is Vietnamese and shouldn't be accepting your staff like this. Really reflect badly about us Vietnamese !!!
4
Overall food was very good - we had the house special pho, papaya salad, spring rolls, iced coffee, and lemonade. The drinks were surprisingly good. Place was a little small as were the tables, but this did not detract from the taste of the food and drinks. Only complaint was that they charge you per wet napkins you use; first place we've been to do this
4
I am a Vietnamese pho lover and it is quite difficult to really find a really nice and tasty pho in Singapore. I have been introduced this place by a friend who knew I would love it and to my surprise it was really tasty. I'm usually going to another viet restaurant to get authentic pho at an affordable price but this place is definitely matching that one. Well located at bugis area, the restaurant might be a bit tight and small table but you will for sure enjoyed the food there. I have tried the pho dac biet and this is one of the best I had in SG. The staff are nice and had check with me if the soup was tasty for me. The staff is also quick to clean the table and serve you the food. I will for sure come again and try the other food.
1
The place was not very clean and dimly lighted with uncomfortable chairs and smallish tables. I ordered the Assam noodles with seafood. The soup was not very tasty as it was very sweet. Assam should be a bit sour. The too soft noodles came with 3 small slices of fish and squid, rather minimal for what they are charging. Pass on by to Bugis junction where there are better eateries with more delicious food
5
Itâ€™s impossible to get hungry in Singapore. The only danger is becoming Buridan's donkey and drown in your saliva while failing to make a choice. If you craving for some Vietnamese food, I can help. Go to Mrs Pho. Yummy delicious! We went there for lunch. The place was packed, and we were asked to wait. Luckily, after just 5 minutes, a couple who came before us agreed to share a table. We ordered good old Pho. It was simply delicious. Next day, we came very late (about half an hour before closing), and they run out of most of the menu items. Too sad
5
This place serve delicious Vietnamese food! The place is small & tight. Service is efficient. Vietnamese staff speak mandarin too! Portion of food here is big for the price. Highly recommend this place!
5
I love the Vietnamese food that Mrs Pho serves. This is a great place for a quick lunch or a leisurely dinner at very attractive prices for Singapore.
4
Mrs. Pho in Beach Road is an authentic Vietnamese Cafe and serve variety of noodle and others. Prices are reasonable
5
I was there for lunch and the lunch crowd wasn't too crowded nor noisy. Ambience is awesome, just like what you will typically see in Vietnam. The food served taste very authentic and served quickly. 👍🏻 will visit again for their coffee the next time
2
We were pointed to a table and when we sat down (still after no conversation) the waitress pointed to a menu and walked off. We understood that we had to write down our order but not through any conversation from the waitress. We were then told that there was no Pho was available. No Pho at Mrs Pho.......??We decided to order noodles and meat instead but after waiting for over 10-15 mins for a waitress to collect our order sheet we wondered if we had to go go the counter to order the food. On the way to the counter the waitress snatched the paper from us and just walked off.Our food arrived in a reasonable time (15 mins or so) but was cold. We had ordered Mrs Phos iced tea -- it was truly revolting.Since there are so many wonderful places to visit in Singapore we wont be going back here
2
Sadly one dish (Pho Bo, a signature dish) and one drink we wanted weren't available but staff seemed to laugh it off rather than apologise. But a 50% strike rate doesn't seem great at 8pm on Tuesday. The dish I got instead was pretty average. Decent prices & good spring rolls though
3
The food was good enough, but the service was a bit strange. They sat us down at a table and pointed to the menus and walked away. We figured out that we needed to actually put our order on an order sheet and hand it to the server. The food came quickly. It was above what I would consider average, but I woudn't call it very good. They did not offer napkins, only wet wipes in individual packages, which I thought was really strange. There were people in the restaurant who had brought their own packets of kleenex that they were using for napkins. The bill came and I paid it, but as we walked out the server came running up saying we needed to pay for the wipes. Whaaaat? Yes, 50 cents a wipe. Was that written anywhere? Did they tell us that before the meal or after she gave us the bill? No! And it's not that I care about paying the money for them, it was just weird that they didn't tell us or put it on the bill, and then came running out the door to tell us to pay. This is our first day in Singapore, and maybe this is a normal practice, but it just took us a little off guard. I would not go back again, but if you are looking for a quick relatively inexpensive meal, it wasn't bad
5
My usual order would be beef combo pho soup, their signature pork ball skewer and the salty lemonade. My beef bowl came with generous serving of beef and soup is tasty. I love the pork ball texture, I can really taste the meat and the spices and not those meat paste that is full of flour in it.The salty lemonade is very refreshing as well.Very good!
5
Did not have to wait too long for our table even though it was lunch hour. Our orders were delivered quickly, the spring rolls were freshly fried and crispy. The staff are extremely fast and efficient especially when clearing tables, perhaps so we don't dawdle about and delay their patrons in waiting. Loved the food and I definitely recommend it
5
Yumm! Yumm! Yumm! Fresh. Tasty. cooked to perfection. The place is small, the prices are very good so they rely on turnover of tables. if the waitresses ask you to do something to facilitate the turnover, do not argue with them as they are fierce!!Great place - will return often and work my way through the entire menu
3
You must reach there before 12pm otherwise you have to queue. The food are nice, place is too narrow. Especially the price is a bit high.
3
Unfortunately, this place can't handle success well. Lunch is hurried and that does the food no good. The spring rolls were soggy and tasteless. Service is aimed at efficiency instead of prividing a good experience. Such a shame...
4
Mrs Pho is a revolving door of hungry patrons. The clear broth of its pho is light and aromatic, not as msg-ladden as other viet pho places (including nam nam at suntec). For $7.90 a bowl, that's a bargain. For the cockles lover, try it's cockles with stir-fried garlic and lard - extremely tasty and portion just nice for two. The restaurant is not large group friendly (no more than 4 pax) and not a place to linger to muse over life - get in, get fed, get out. Parking can be quite painful, go before 6:30pm on weekends
5
Anything in soup is very nice but recommended to go for beef ones. The dry ones are very nice too. Spring rolls fresh and fried must try. Salty lemonade for those that likes it fresh. Or Vietnamese coffee are very good choice as well. Very crowded usually so to avoid disappointment go early.
4
The best thing to do is to arrive early. Mrs. Pho is a Vietnamese restaurant serving pho & other dishes. It is run by Vietnamese people and service here is brisk & efficient. The combination pho of beef slices, beef balls and beef brisket really hit the spot as I was craving some comforting soupy goodness. Also ordered the rice paper rolls and green papaya salad. Both were excellent. I paid and left just as the lunchtime crowds descended
5
Arrived right at 12 Noon and by 12:15 not a table available in the shop. I had the beef Pho and the Vietnamese pork / shrimp rolls - both were outstanding and arrived fast. Staff, although, only a few - met every need in the restaurant! Will definitely go back for great reasonable extremely tasty Pho
3
The menu offers a great choice of Vietnamese dishes. The restaurant is decoreated nicely and brings cozy atmosphere to customers. Portions of noodles and some others can be a bit smaller than expected comparing to the prices we pay. The quality of food, however, used to be better and tastier when they were first open. Despite of that, if you're a round Beach Road neighborhood, it's worth giving a try
4
Went here recently with a friend and enjoyed it, I had chicken pho which was light and full of flavour and tasty and I would highly recommend it. We also had free spring rolls which were also great. Its just the atmosphere that I have to say I am not a fan of. You wait outside for quite a while and its not a first come first served basis - its whatever table size is ready. I do have some understanding for it but when you watch 4 other larger parties go in and you are still waiting it gets a bit frustrating. then we were on a table and we had to interrupt our neighbours for our spoons, chopsticks and sauces. Its not an ideal set up. Then there is a noise, the bumps, the constant frenetic activity and then there is the CASH ONLY situation, not ideal in this modern world.. I do understand its a cheap and cheerful place, but you still have to make it enjoyable. I would come back but could only bring certain people here and recommend it a few
4
We went there for a girls night out.. filled the tiny table with loads of stuff. we wish we could try everything in the menu... so far the dishes were yummy, very authentic, and the prices weren't expensive. A lovely experience... (except maybe it was a little cramped! But that also added to the authenticity!
2
Went there for lunch, ordering two bowls of pho, a glass of viet coffee, and stir fried cockles.I'm trying my best not to be too snobbish here, despite the flavourfull soup and decent beef slices, the beef balls were rubbery and a bit bland. The cockles were not fresh. Everyone knows that closed cooked cockles are not a good sign, I forced myself to eat four of them, and those were unpleasant.
5
Been there for a dinner with my wife after reading the review. Ordered 2 Pho and a rice spring roll. Nice food and price is not too expensive. Place a bit small only.
5
Fast and prompt service, did not have to wait long for our drinks or food and our dinner was ordered eaten and paid for within 30 minutes. Food is also good quality
3
This is my second time eating at this place this time the special beef combo noodle spoup the beef ball was so hard like rubber.
5
Very authentic Vietnamese food. Fully run by Vietnamese. Good value for money.
It is opened daily from lunch till dinner
4
I chanced upon this hole in a wall while reading a local e-magazine on where to get good pho. It wasn't too far from my office so I went with some colleagues during lunch. Since then I have been there twice. The place is tiny. Probably about 300 sft of seating space. The tables are shoulder width coupled with round stools. Expect to feel "cozy". The décor was a good imitation of a back alley in Vietnam. The staff I saw were Vietnamese. They work pretty fast so the food arrived in 10min of ordering. The serving is ok for a small eater. I finished my without feeling full. I am not sure if it is enough for guys. But the place seemed popular with expatriates working nearby. My friends who didn't eat beef took the chicken & another took seafood. I took Pho Bo. I'm partial towards beef & I felt it tasted better than the rest. The soup isn't piping hot. So the side bowl where they place the uncooked egg in does not over cook. I know different cooks have their own "version" of pho. The soup here was bordering sweet. Unlike those that I have tasted in Vietnam & other Singaporean restaurants serving pho. If slightly sweet soup is your thing, head over for your pho fix.
5
I come to this place for a quick lunch. Even though the place is quite packed for Sunday lunch, I still can get a table for myself. I like the atmosphere here. The Phở is good as usual. I forget to ask for poached bean sprout rather than the raw one. It's crowded but not noisy
4
Came here for lunch recently with colleagues and we were fortunate to get one of the last tables at around 12pm, after which a long line formed outside. Service was efficient, but there was definite pressure to finish the meals quickly and get out in order to let more people in - this detracted somewhat from the experience. Food was good though and the prices reasonable
2
First of all, we had a lunch there at 13, it was crowded, very noisy. We were disappointed with a quality of the service: a pair of ladies at our table unsuccessfully tried to change the order, after 4th try the ordered extra salad instead of their initial request. Our waiting time was quite long, we received the bill before getting our order. The food was ok.In summary, we were not satisfied with our experience and can't recommend this place
4
A friend recommended we go here after walking past and looking up the reviews. Did not at all disappoint. Was very well priced and so yummy! Fresh and lovely with loads of flavour. Don't forget the atmosphere on those tiny stools. Book or go early because by 6.45, the place was so full you could not move. Don't go if you don't like sitting close to other tables also.

this is a rare find. of the few vietnamese restaurants that i have been to, this is by far the best and most authentic. the menu is wide and varied. the prices are average. food quality is great. we were fortunate not to have to wait long to get a table by the door. the food came quickly after we ordered. it was super noisy though, so if you can't bear with the noise, come after the lunch time crowd. otherwise you might feel the stress of having to eat and run as the restaurant caters to the office crowd, so the feeling of being 'shooed' is there. will return to try the other stuff on their menu next time
5
This is an amazing restaurant - lovely food - a colleague who is Vietnamese rates it highly. The main problem is getting a table as it is always full
5
This is a really great restaurant. The restaurant is simple and the main attraction is simply the food. It tastes so yummy. I absolutely love eating there.
5
I've travelled to Vietnam on multiple occasions and can honestly say this is the best pho I've had. While perhaps less authentic than the beef pho, I highly recommend the chicken with glass noodle. Very satisfying!
5
Great healthy Vietnamese food. The broth is so tasty and everything is homemade and fresh. Value for money and lovely service. Make the effort to find and visit.

Food was great with reasonable price. Simple and unique restaurant with lovely design.
One minus point - the moment you finished your food and put down your cutlery, the waitress immediately came and clear the bowl while there were still other food on the table.

i've been here twice and on both occasions the food was great, especially considering the affordable price range. the food is tasty and made with lots of care. the drinks are also worth a try! i would recommend the avocado smoothie (especially if you're ordering something spicy as it complements really well), and also the vietnamese iced milk coffee (if you're a coffee drinker). i wish they sold their coffee beans because it was just so good! however, i feel that the service from wait staff can be improved because as a diner, i felt very rushed and anxious from the minute i sat down. the waiter allowed us little time to look through the menu before coming to our table twice to collect our orders when we were not ready, and although the food took its time to arrive at our table, the wait staff tried to clear our plates even when we still had food on our plates! lots of unnecessary running and flapping about from the waiters, so if the people working here can just relax and calm down a bit, i'm sure the experience would have been much more pleasant

Very good Vietnamese food, Located along Beach Road probably one of the best Pho in Singapore. The broth is so tasty and everything is homemade and fresh. Portions are generous and so are the condiments. Overall Mrs. Pho food is just delicious at a very reasonable price. The restaurant is rather small with limited space, and it gets pretty crowded, itâ€™s cozy and very homely, Tables and seats are also small. Service is effectual and welcoming; this is a great place for street food style Viet. highly recommended. Definitely will come back

This little busy shop serves some pretty yummy PHO! Even though there's no Chin-Su sauce (it's another brand, same same but different) nor does it taste like the PHOs we had in hanoi, the setting is nostalgic and the bowls of pho are just so hearty and home-ish. The spring rolls had every thing we were looking for in it: sliced pork, prawns, rice noodle, and some veggie. Sauce accompanying it was good as well. Both the chicken and beef pho, and spicy noodles are pretty good!I've been there three - four times in the past month or so now, food is consistent, service is pretty good, and the shop is always busy, be it in the afternoon or evening. Mixture or expats, Vietnamese, and locals who patronise this humble shop. One of the highlights is that this shop is run by Vietnamese, so you can be sure about its authenticity.For the price ($) and quality, this place is definitely worth a visit

I have been here too many times now - in fact I sent my family while I had to work. Not thinking, but they all loved it, including the fussy ones.Lots of noodles, lots of soupy noodles, interspersed with meatballs, fresh spring rolls, salads, lovely juice and end on a drop coffee.In fact, if it was open now (past midnight), I'd go!
4
Located along Bench Road, this is a small restaurant restaurant with limited space. Tables and seats are small. Typical Vietnamese Style. Simple menu with simple food. The noodles are tasty and authentic. Light and delicious. Price is affordable. Typical food court prices. $6 to $7. Try a cup of their Vietnamese hot coffee after your meal. Enjoy!
4
Very good Vietnamese food, probably one of the best Pho in town. Very small so you may have to squeeze a bit. Highly recommended.
3
A nice little shophouse Vietnamese place ... the Pho was good but the soup was a little light in all honesty. The beef combo pho had good meat and the fresh spring rolls were pretty good.
Well priced at only about S$7-9 for a bowl.
4
Reminded me of Pho we had in Vietnam, very authentic! Service was very quick and response and friendly! Pretty crowded cuz it's so good, really enjoyed the buzz!
4
Liked this cosy place a lot. Good food and nice service. But the seats are not good. Too bad, because all the rest is absolutely fine.
5
Be prepared to queue to eat at this little Vietnamese joint which has been really well decorated. The food is great too - we had soft rolls, spring rolls and pho and it was delicious and reasonably priced.
3
This is a pretty popular Vietnamese joint around Bugis area. Offers a good selection of Vietnamese cuisine for meat lovers.
5
The viet food they serve was one of the most authentic and best viet food I ever have in Singapore, other than in HCMC. Have been to the nice and friendly restaurant twice and will keep going back as my viet wife loves it very much. Their service was great too and they are all Vietnamese able to speak Chinese and English. I like the ambience too as it resembles a viet restaurant in Vietnam
4
Mrs Pho serves good & authentic Viet food at a very reasonable price. Way better than Nam Nam anytime. Portions are generous and so are the condiments! Every time my family needs a Viet food fix, we always head straight for Mrs Pho. The only set back is difficulty in finding parking lots.
5
If you are looking for a restaurant that mimics what you get in Saigon, Mrs Pho comes pretty close with its aluminum tables, stools, electric wires and bulbs and even the way utensils and sauces are stored on each table. There is a table with a low stool outside but I suspect it is mainly deco, but if you care enough to know, that is actually how most roadside stall sits their customers in.The service staff and chefs are Viets, but aside from the Pho, you generally get equal or better quality back at HCMC. For hard core Pho fans, they serve their broth South Vietnamese style. The broth is a little light compared to what I had in Saigon. The beef isn't as tender as well but the portions are not lesser. The Goi Cuon is a little dry but the peanut sauce is really good. Speaking of sauce, they have Sirachai (excuse my spelling) for the spice lovers.The broken rice definitely isn't up to par yet with what you get in Saigon. Com Tam dishes signature is the freshly-grilled fragrant protein and the soft broken rice-- both which might disappoint you here. I personally love Banh Cuon but they don't serve it here as well.The coffee and iced green tea are very close to what you can experience in Saigon. Overall good is a tad pricy but fair deal if you miss your Vietnamese cuisine and deco

I usually go for Nam Nam due to the convenience then a friend brought me here. So we ordered our pho and I had the mixed beef pho, which came with an egg soup. We also ordered spring rolls and cockles on garlic. The pho was fantastic, the egg soup was brilliant! We could have ordered another bowl of it if we were not so stuffed. But the cockles was disappointing. It was not fresh and as it was fried with garlic on the outside, the cockles itself have no taste of the garlic unless you mix it yourself after removing it from the shell. Eaten alone, the cockles were bitter as they were no fresh, sadly. Come here for the pho but there are room for improvement for their side dishes.
4
Can be quite packed during lunch time. Nice pho with generous fillings. Cool backlane interior as well. Will definitely come again.
5
My dad and I went here for dinner and back the next day for lunch. Amazing food, great service and value for money. Highly recommend!
5
Amazing little Vietnamese restaurant, don't miss the pho - the best we got in Singapore so far, as good as the ones in Vietnam. Their broth is divine! So good it has become our regular.
4
If you feel tired of strong or oily tastes, MrsPho is a good choice.
U could enjoy light soup full of umami of beef and scent of herbs.
4
There are both North and South Vietnamese food here. You have choice of noodles or rice, side dishes and hot or cold drinks. I like the traditional setting and the noodles that come with lots of vegetables! Though the place is small, you don't feel congested and the staff here are friendly and smiley
5
Delicious genuine Vietnamese food prepared by a real Vietnamese chef. We started with a selection of appetizers and were all impressed on our first bites. You can really tell that the chef has used a lot of fresh herbs and ingredients to pack heaps of flavours into the dishes. Then came the pho and it did not disappoint! It was a taste of childhood, real comfort food in a small bowl. The broth was aromatic and umami sweet, it was not oily like the ones you often found in restaurants, and tasted really homey. A must try if you are in Singapore and craving Vietnamese food with an affordable price tag
4
Whenever I have a craving for pho, I like up head on down to Mrs Pho. It's a cosy joint with a homely feel. Food comes fast and the pho is consistently the same. I'm a cockle lover so I love the garlic stir-fried cockle with dollops of crispy pork lard. Frankly, the lard calls out to me as much! I'm not a food critic so don't expect a detailed description of the taste, balance etc. I like what I like! You may differ. The appetisers are worth a try too n all washed down with the salty plum soda. Yum.Gonna head down soon
5
I went here with a colleague for a quick business lunch. We ordered our food outside while we waited for a table as this little restaurant is always crowded. I'm vegetarian so they made special fresh spring rolls for me and a main dish which wasn't even in the menu. The food was superb and I really appreciated the effort to make a wonderful meal for me at a busy time of day. Can't wait to go back.
5
My wife and i were in Singapore for a short holiday.Found this place on TripAdvisor and it was great. Very fresh, very fast and friendly service.We tried pretty much the entire menu and all was delicious.Will be our 1st stop for lunch, next time we go back to Singapore
4
I have to say this is better than Nam Nam!Before that Nam Nam was good, but apparently they changed their menu, and their new menu doesn't seems good. Mrs Pho's beef noodle is very good! Tender beef and tasty soup base! But i just find that the noodles were too soft. But overall is fantastic!Beef ball is something you must try! it's a secret recipe from the owner's mom!I had Vietnamese coffee, it was up to standard :
4
Phở is quite good. Not the best, but tasty. Beef ball is not as good as the one from Namnam, but soft noodle. Bánh ướt chả is excellent. I will try other dishes next time. I will come back to this place for sure.
4
I have tried many little pho places around Singapore, but Mrs Pho was a real discovery. It is easily the best, most authentic Vietnamese restaurant I have tried so far - and I guess so have many people, because on a recent weekday morning, it was packed, despite its rather awkward location. But it is a trip worth taking. Mrs Pho has great pho (of course), but also some of the best Vietnamese spring rolls, pork balls - and some of the most succulent chicken wings. I am definitely going back again
4
Though its a small little place, tight seatings next to one another, small table tops, this place served a few good viet selections.Chicken meat ball in skewer is a must try. Deep fried vietnamese spring rolls, the original wrap spring rolls are good. They have a small list of food items however the beef noodles are acceptable for the label price. Not the best that i have tastedA place good to check out for a quick bite. Not comfortae to sit for long chats
5
This is my first time at this place. The ambience is nice, cosy & clean. Love the decor. Try the fresh spring roll was great.We order the sliced beef & brisket noodle soup( Pho Bo Tai Nam) & special beef combo noodle soup(Pho Bo Dac Biet) it taste delicious. The soup taste great authentic vietnamese style.The food price is reasonable. Quality of food is high not like those at Joo Chiat the one with the long queue. Service here is good. Staff are friendly. You don't have to wait long for your order it is quick.Would highly recommend anyone who love vietnamese food. 5 stars ****

Vietnam is one of my favorite travel destinations because of the people, food, and coffee. The ambiance of a local cafe and eatery in Vietnam has been re-created at Mrs. Pho in Singapore on Beach Road. The wait staff are exceptionally thoughtful Vietnamese who welcome you and are eager and happy to tell you about the unique dishes on their menu and make a recommendation if you are not in the mood to make a decision.The low to the ground tables and chairs are reminiscent of Vietnam and the wall decor and shelving displays are filled with Vietnam foods, ceramics and coffee.Remember to taste the Vietnam lemonade on a hot Singapore day or night and enjoy the iced Cafe sua dah (Vietnam coffee with condensed milk) after your lunch or dinner.Mrs. Pho is friendly to solo diners, small and medium size groups and is a delightful experience to share with your friends. The simple to read menu also includes some pictures to assist with your selection or simply look around at the numerous dishes being served and inquire into your dish of interest. The prices are very reasonable, especially given the fresh and delectable foods with Vietnam herbs and spices

A hip and cosy Vietnamese restaurant with authentic food at affordable prices. Good place for dates and a good, simple meal with friends.Location - Easy to get to, a short 15 minute walk away from the nearest MRT station Bugis. Easily accessible by car or taxi. It is also in a place where there's lots of places nearby to get a coffee or drink after dinner.Service - Good. Prompt and friendly. Food - One of the more authentic Vietnamese restaurants in town. Atmosphere - The interior of the restaurant is decorated to look as if you're dining outdoor in a little alleyway. Cool ambience.Wait time - Not much of a wait time if you get there early before 7pm. Been there twice before 7pm and didn't have to wait at all. It does get busy after that. Recommendations - For appetisers, I loved the Hanoi Meatballs (very tender and tasty). The Cockles Stir-Fried with garlic was a hit with my friends who were self professed experts on all things regarding the consumption of cockles. The second time we tried this dish, the cockles were not as big and juicy as the first time, so I guess it kind of depends on the luck of the draw (depending on the deliveries from the market). However, the way it was done still resulted in a delicious starter!For the mains, go for any of the pho or the glass noodle chicken soup. The broth was tasty and the ingredients were fresh, what's not to like? If you're more of a rice person, go for the Rice with pork chop, viet ham and fried egg. Do try the saigon salty lemonade. Goes well with the meal and by itself
4
Tried this place for the first time today and was overwhelming pleased. The food is authentic and great. What I really appreciated was that the ingredients seemed to be of very high quality. I usually go to that popular place on Joo Chiat Road, but to be honest that will stop. The noodles, sauces, spring rolls are all much better here. The beef in the pho is tender and juicy not like the chewy rubbery cheap stuff you get on Joo Chiat. The only reason I gave them 4 is because they are not really open for dinner (I thought this would be a great place to bring out of towners and they don't serve beer. Give this place a try, you will not be disappointed.

My better half introduced me to this intimate Vietnamese restaurant along Beach Road. Apparently it's not a well kept secret since it was packed during Monday dinner time and the presence of a few Vietnamese groups (including the vicinity's pretty night workers) validates the authenticity of Mrs Pho's cooking. Patrons are predominantly CBD office crowd and its queuing crowd during lunch hours.Now the delicacies, the Beef Pho is truly Class 1 Div 1 quality and in big serving. Move aside Nxx Nxx, even Pho 2000 in HCM can take a leaf from them. The Goi Cuon (fresh spring rolls) and mango and papaya salads are tops too. Everything here is pure and real Vietnamese fare and with the handsome/pretty service staff/Mrs Pho herself, one will be transported to the streets of District 1 Ben Thanh area street eateries, albeit in a comfy aircon one. In a cheeky gesture to add to the authenticity, even the solitary outdoor low table and stools, ala Vietnam street stalls, were also occupied! Accompany yr meals with the extensive drinks list. The prices? Extremely reasonable with mains at $8, entrees from $3 and drinks from $2!We will definitely be back real soon Mrs Pho, to try the pork chop and lemon grass grilled chicken rice dishes and Banh Canh Cua. Pleasure us Mrs Pho by completing your winning formula with Banh Mi and some Vietnamese desserts
3
I didn't like the food as much as I'd hoped. It doesn't feel as authentic as Lung Phung in Joo Chiat, but if you do not want to hike to the east, maybe it is the best available option.The space is cute though. It try to emulate street eating in an air-conditioned environment. We do see Vietnamese eating there so it may be more authentic than the other Vietnamese chain stores in the city
4
I've only been to this establishment once but vowed to come again. While it's not the most spacious of places (hey, this is Asia!), the menu is authentic and the pho dishes are delicious. There are plenty of other eateries nearby but the crowded tables here are testament to the quality of the food. The furniture is typically Vietnamese cafe style so don't expect to by luxuriating in plush surrounds. But it's comfortable enough and the pho will more than compensate for any discomfort
5
We were there for lunch. Atmosphere very friendly, great tasty food served quite rapidly. Very kind staff. Seems to be known also by locals.
I recommend!
4
Very easy going and very good pho and other Vietnamese dishes. Good prices and in a decent area - only takes cash. Would recommend the chicken soup
5
Real great Vietnamese cuisine. For 13 Singaporean dollars u can have a great great large bowl of noodles and a drink. Super tasty! And if u stay in the Pod capsule hotel so close!!!! I recommend this place to everyone@@!
5
Real Vietnamese dishes! Nice and affordable meal very convenient if you stay at the Pod capsule hotel. Great value .
4
love the fooddd.... finalllly I found one..must tryy!! beautiful and relaxing environment. reasonable price..
come almost every week!!
beef noodle soup , pork vermicelli , spring rolls.. pork ball.. wao.. love itt!!!
5
I've eaten here several times with co-workers. The place is jammed during lunch. Everything I've had has been very good and very affordable.
Prepare to be cramped though.
Will definitely be back.
5
We come here for our monthly pho fix. Food is reasonable priced and of high standards. The usual offerings ( fried spring rolls, fresh spring rolls, beef phos like the special beef noodle combo soup) all do not disappoint. We tend to visit this place on a Saturday evening between 6-7pm. There is an occasional wait for the 2 of us, nothing beyond 10 minutes, and the food gets served quickly. The space is tight so large groups and families with small children will have to adapt, although the restaurant does provide that ubiquitous ikea baby chair. Again, because of the above, it is not quite the place to linger, so we are usually done and out within half an hour or so to explore the rest of Kampong Glam.
5
This is my usual haunt for lunch as I work within the vicinity. The first time I tried, I ended up having both my lunch and dinner in Mrs Pho! And I have stopped dining in other Vietnamese restaurant.The soup is superb but the only reason that keeps me away from the signature noodle soup is the flat noodles, as shown on their menu that i dont like - just a personal preference.My personal favourites are Vermicelli with BBQ Pork and Spring roll, Stir fried beef noodles (vermicelli) with Lemongrass and stew beef noodle soup. The beef stew noodle soup is a great option for a thicker, beefy soup and the noodles are springy to my liking! Generous meat portion in all the noodles :)The meat balls are delicious and the fresh spring rolls are... really fresh!!Cheery Vietnamese servers give an authentic Vietnamese feel to the restaurant.The packed timing is only between 12.30-1pm. Go anytime before or after that, you'll definitely get a seat :
3
The place serves the usual Vietnamese food. We order the beef noodle soup and the dry vermicelli version. Both are very tasty and in large quantity. The downside is the place is very packed hence not a place to chi, relax or chitchat with friends. And there was a queue when we were there. Drop by if you are along new beach road......
5
Been to Mrs Pho for 4 times so far and would come back again & againFood - reliable quality - fresh and i tried most items on the menu - no dissappointmentEspecially like the pho, fried spring roll and grill meatball. Remember to order the very refreshing Salty LemonadeService - prompt and politePrices - affordable n pretty much standard compared to others Vietnamese joints in SGAmbience - good but cramped, so be careful when you moved too much - its a very small eatery but big in qualit
