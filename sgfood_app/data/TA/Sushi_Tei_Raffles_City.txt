It was our first night in Singapore and we needed an easy dinner. Sooooo fresh. Delicious. Definitely would recommend for a single or family or couple. Will go again before leaving
5
Will recommend the salmon sashimi salad and ikura chawanmushi. Cooked food dishes like oyako don, soba noodles and hotpot are not bad either. Their green tea and black sesame ice cream are pretty delicious.
3
standards at sushi tei in general have been dropping, in the face of competition from other japanese restaurants, so this particular outlet was no different. service standards and food quality here are decent, but has visibly dropped since a 5 years ago.
5
Restaurant is decorated with pleasant Japanese style with comfortable seats, no any crowded feeling. High chair is also available for infant.
Staff are courteous and helpful. Food are serving quick.
4
Never fails to upkeep standards - delicious food and good quality. Favourite is the unagi hitsumabushi and kani mentai sushi.
5
Sushi Tei is our family favorite sushi joint. Price is of medium range but the food is fantastic. Be prepared to queue if you go at their peak period like 7-8pm. Itâ€™s advisable to get a membership card if you like their food so that you can get a 10% discount on the overall bill. They have many outlets so you could go to the one nearest to your place. Enjoy

We had not been to Sushi Tei for a while, and for a good reason. We had been increasingly disappointed with the quality of the food, and the service (ranging from brusque to acceptable). It was crowded as ever, and I suppose this is due to the positioning of the chain (menu, price, service) as being geared to the mass market. You could call it the burger king of Japanese food. Still, the so-called autumn menu was disappointing. We had the wagyu beef don ($23.80) which tasted decent, but was not much different from the yakiniku don at less than half the price. The sashimi special from this menu ($36.80) was also disappointing. We got three slices of everything - a better cut of salmon (not a proper fish for sashimi), sweet shrimp, scallops and ark shell. But it was not of sashimi grade.I think if one were to visit at all, stick to tried and tested items such as the saba shio and chawanmushi, which were quite decent
4
We love Sushi Tei for our weekly japanese fix for the extensive variety and solid quality. We live in the East and ever since the outlet in Big Splash closed down, we have been patronising the Raffles City outlet. Service is good and quick, and the food is value for money
3
I had a variety of Sushi and whilst the quality was okay, it was not outstanding. Considering the price point of the Sushi I would have expected a bit more.The service is quick, but not overly friendly. The noodles were blant and reminded me of super-market quality ramen.The Wagyu steak was good and the mild teriyaki sauce fit perfectly
2
The service of this restaurant was pretty good, we didn't have to wait long to be seated, and the waitresses were attentive. That was the extent of how good this meal was.Otherwise, I'll be perfectly honest. I've had better sushi from supermarkets.For the price we paid, honestly, I was disappointed. Never coming back
4
Good quality at reasonable price . Menu really various , with good proposal of differente Japanese specialities .
Nice to stay there we enjoyed the dinner .
4
Took some friends here for dinner. Fortunately we went early for after we were seated, it was fully seated and a queue started to form outside. The food is good but the service staff might need a bit more training.
4
Very convenient location in Raffle city shopping center , just the above the Metro city hall station. Quality of sea food is good. Very suitable for a quick but delicious meal, if you like Japanese food.
4
Affordable sushi restaurants in Singapore. Sushi Tei is one of the famous Japanese restaurants in Singapore
4
Standards are always kept high and the fish is so fresh! Definitely worth the money for some authentic Jap food
2
Waiter can't be bothered to set each dish in front of the correct person. He just dumps them all on the nearest part of the table and makes us distribute them across the table. Service is getting worse at sushi tei - we've got loyalty card and been coming here for 10 years
2
There was a point in time when people grew tired of terrible faux Japanese cuisine served up by some local joints and turned to Sushi Tei as a place where they could enjoy some decent Japanese fare at relatively reasonable prices.In the recent years, with real Japanese restaurants springing up all over the place, Sushi Tei has fallen far behind and this can be seen in the tired and worn out decor and menu when you first walk in to the restaurant.We had a Kaisen-don, an inconsistent bowl of rice which is sometimes topped with a seaweed furukake and sometimes missed out. It normally comes with a single slice of salmon, a single slice of tuna, a single slice of tamago, and a slice of octopus, a spoonful of ikura.I usually order the Kaisen-don since it's one of those dishes that require very little skill in preparing so it minimizes the chances that it goes wrong. In my most recent visit, I took a closer look at the ikura and noticed the "yolk" was not whole but broken up into smaller globules causing my dining partner to remark that some restaurants, in order to cut costs, would use artificial ikura that was made by some molecular gastronomy technique. I'm not sure to make of it but I wasn't impressed. The service was quite alright, typical of local standards. Some parts of the restaurant can be a little warm so request for one of those darker cooler places.I personally don't enjoy dining here, there are much better kaisen-dons out there for the same price with heaps of fresh fish rather than the sad looking slices you'd get here
5
One of the rare eateries at Raffles City that does not look like a fast food outlet (even though it almost is given its turn around) but one never feels pressed, the selection is amazing, the sushi as well as 30 other dishes superb, the service efficient ... And the prices more tha affordable for the quality
4
Fab Japanese restaurant on Level 3 of Raffles City. Ate dinner there two days in a row. The menu is very extensive, more so than any other Japanese restaurant I've been to. Both nights there was a queue of people lining up to get a table - which is a good sign.Second night we were offered ice water to drink, but not on the first visit - not sure why. Maybe they were too busy. Choose carefully from the menu - 2nd visit we left fuller and the bill was slightly less than the first visit the day before and we had more food the 2nd time around. Grape sherbet ice cream was very nice as well
2
Was in town (bras basah road).for a church service, after which the families said let's go to sushi tei for dinner in raffle city just a stone throw away, cause kids love japanese. (4 adult 6 kids)Oh mine, overall food was very disappointing. The hokkaido ramen was so so salty, my grandson couldn't finish, my oyakondon chicken has a frozen taste and salty. My daughter ramen was luke warm also never finish. Never check on the kids meal as all were hungry is almost 10pm.When the mgr came round to collect the dishes as they close at 10.30 I think, I told her verbally how bad was our dinner. Her respond.The hokkaido ramen very very salty. REPLY miso is salty, well we know we cook miso at home too. But this is far too salty to stomach.Told her oyakondon chicken taste frozen, REPLY we feed back to supplier already.Ramen was luke warm, REPLY should have tell us we warm it.But surely that's no way to serve food with a well established food outlet. These foods are really not suitable for consumption and we pay good money for it.Surely the management has to improve do spot check and make sure food standard is good in such a busy outlet. Very very sad very very disappointed
5
This was my 3 rd time enjoying my sushi tei! Reasonable price, fresh and delicious japanese food, friendly staffs!!
4
Popped into Sushi Tei for lunch. The service was friendly and prompt. The food was fresh, tasty and reasonably priced. Loved the rainbow roll.
5
Great variety of food, fresh with consistent standards and speedy service. Good for large groups. Sunday lunch is usually not crowded.
3
I had lunch at Sushi Tei's Raffles Place outlet. I ordered gyoza and garlic rice. Both very average. And they have a limoncello-tasting kind of sake. Avoid it like the plague. The service is friendly though. There are better places in and around Raffles Place.
4
I was in Raffles City, hungry and it was lunchtime and I saw the Sushi Tei sign. I love sushi, so I went in and I didn't regret my decision.Although, there was the ubiquitous sushi train going around, the place was a bit more special than that, with an excellent selection of dishes. I ended up ordering from the menu, rather than raiding the train, even though I was actually sitting there because I was alone. The place wasn't totally full but close to it and the staff wanted to keep the tables for the families and other groups. Fair enough! They asked me very politely if I didn't mind sitting next to the sushi train. I was quite happy to do that.Everything I tried was delicious and nicely presented.The key ingredients were good quality and fresh but perhaps the roe was a little too fishy, although still within the acceptable range. I probably wouldn't have noticed if everything else weren't so good! ;-)There was a reasonably good choice of drinks but oddly, a very narrow selection of teas. Right, it's a Sushi place, not a Japanese tea house but still... If you are in a sushi restaurant, drink the customary green tea, I suppose! They didn't hesitate to refill my cup, as soon as the tea level was falling too far. Luckily, there was a reasonable selection of good sake.Service was good. I wouldn't call it exceptional but nothing to complain about, either.When it came to the bill, it was a bit on the pricey side but on the other hand, I did not order from the cheap end of the menu and everything was very enjoyable. What would be the point of cheap, if you didn't enjoy your meal?
3
Okay, so sushi is generally expensive but I found this place to be a little bit overpriced for the food you can get. Don't get me wrong the selection is beautyful, the edemame and all the makis and sushis we tried were nice but nothing special. Service is fast but not too nice. Staff is almost a bit rude. The restaurant is extremely cold and dark, I'm not sure if I'd ever go back, simply because there are other better restaurants in Singapore. Well, it's OK though if you are in the neighborhood and fancy some Japanese food.
4
Sushi is ok but the other dishes seem better than their sushi. I had the mini dragon roll and another random roll off the belt. Both were average. It was cool in the restaurant so the rice seemed a bit hard and old. But service was good and very attentive and oddly they charge if you use their prepackaged wet tissues. Singapore itself has no paper towels in the restrooms and like most Asian places the restrooms are seldom ever in the restaurant no matter how big the place is. Very annoying in Asia. Guess its a poor urban planning plumbing issue. Be ready to go about a half kilometer away to find the restrooms in almost all of Korean and Singapore restaurants.
4
Visited the outlet at Vivocity. Was given a table for 2 which looks across to Sentosa. Have always loves the Garlic Fried Rice here. The Udo and dessert are not bad too. This place starts to get crowded after 6pm on weekends so we had an earlier dinner here so that we don't have to queue
4
the salmon sashimi here is always fresh and tasty. My next favourite item is the aburi salmon sushi ( lightly seared by fire). menu was updated recently. Green tea is no longer free. not an issue.. sushi and food on the belt were limited. Order from the menu if you do not want to wait. Service is rather prompt.It gets very crowded close to 6pm. if you want a seat fast, get in before 6p
5
I went to the restauarant after lunch. It was quite nice and quiet. I ordered the Asama with 3 different types of fish (4 slices each). It was heavenly! Then I ordered Rainbow Roll to wrap up my meal. Service was prompt and ambience was great
5
If you want something more than the food court experience, this is it. Cute secluded booths, great menu, good prices, terrific service, excellent food.
5
Extensive menu, with some interesting choices. Service is very fast, so don't expect an evening out.
Reasonable price.
5
An extensive menu, with sushi, sashimi and a varied menu of Japanese favourites. Noisy, busy and frantic....
3
First time in this chain restaurant and sat at the sushi bar which had no sushi on it just the occasional picture. Whether this is a sign of the quality or the taste is to customers liking I don't know. The pork katsu was tough and oily. The sushi seemed dry. Ichiban Boshi is much better. Paul's Restaurant Rating Rating 1 - 51. Disaster will never go again2. Poor, likely will not eat again3. Average, nothing exceptional4. Good, will come back5. Excellent, love this restaurant.

My family decided to try sushi Teh at Raffles city since the queue is not so long at raffles city outlet on weekend. Our birthday celebration there was well served by the staff Ms Wai Lee, very cheerful and honest staff that recommend quality food to us. My family enjoyed the good ambience and the fresh food served to us. It was worthwhile paying the 10% service charge and better to spent here rather than paying high price at Mandarin hotel triple three cafe and get only normal sushi and simple sashimi (if you are looking for Japanese food standard).
4
We decided to head to Sushi Tei on a public holiday for dinner. We got there early and asked for a table for 5. As the air con is directly above quite a few of the tables, we asked for 1 that is away from it. While the host was pleasant in obliging, the faces on the service crew weren't pleased. It was a chore for them as we asked if another table is free. When we spilt our tea, the service staff although had to be called over and we had to ask for a cloth, she did do a really good job in assisting us to clean up. Food was good, and even though the place packed up, the service staff who was attending to our table was friendly and cheerful. Kudos to her!! (Shame I didn't get her name
4
I ordered yakidori don and I found that the chicken pieces were chopped slightly big, but the sauce and portion given saved the whole dish. What interest me was the design of the restaurant and the seating area. It felt like a maze when I entered and the dining area had a cosy sofa
5
Really enjoyed the setup of the place and the variety when it came to the menu and the sushi belt. The taste was very authentic and delicious. The staff are not friendly, and if you go at non dinner or lunch times you get to skip the waiting and payment queues.
4
Sushi Tei is another chain of reliably good Japanese restaurant. The sushi and sashimi freshly made and the fish were fresh. The Golden Roll and Dragon Roll sushi were delicious and so were the other sashimi dishes. Not so sure about the chawan mushy nor the yaki soba, the noodles were too cooked though a generous serving. Service was attentive and prompt, better service than another Chinese dumpling restaurant chain
4
This restaurant was very busy and this encouraged us to have a look. The food was good if a little rushed but one look at the line waiting showed how,popular it was with the locals.Tempura and sashimi were very good. Gyoza's were excellent and better than some very expensive places we have eaten at. Salmon tataki was a surprise as this was a western themed Japanese dish that really worked.Prices were reasonable and the place was full of locals enjoying fresh Japanese with a twist
4
Sushi tei is affordable and consistent quality. While the menu has a huge selection, I prefer to grab from the conveyor belt. Today's selection was quite minimal. That said, I will go back but probably to a different location.
3
Food is average, ambience is quite nice. Service is ok. Price is affordable. For local standard, this is average... There are other better and high end Japanese restaurants around.
5
Quite long waiting queue, but it's absolutely worth it. Once you're seated the service is fast. And the food is excellent. Huge choice of japanese tasty fish dishes, sushi and sashimi. Great quality. Prices are really reasonable.
4
The food was wonderful and fresh and was one of the best meals we had in Singapore. Service needs to be improved, this would improve sales as nothing happens when staff stand chatting.
4
I'm a fan of sushi tei and i have tried their food in most of the outlets in singapore. They are very consistent in their food quality in all their branches!
3
There're lots of sushi and other food to choose from, sashimi, sushi, salad, udon, etc. We've tried Dragonroll, Avocadoroll, Potato Croquette and others. Food is averagely good, ambience and service is good. And most importantly it's not expensive (average spend is Sing $ 50-60 for 2 persons)! Overall speaking, I think it's worth trying
5
I've been a card-carrying Sushi Tei Loyalty Program member for the past decade so I suppose this review is tinged with a bias.I've never had any negative experience in any Sushi Tei. Quality is consistent across branches, even when the place is packed with the lunch and dinner crowd.While they attempt to add variety through a seasonal menu, I generally skip these and go straight to the standard menu.Two thumbs up
4
It was a popular outlet on a Friday night. Despite the 30 mins wait, I was impressed by the efficient operations with rather attentive and courteous staff. The team definitely deserved a round of applause. The tuna sashimi melted in our mouths. Frozen strawberries were interesting. We enjoyed our meal.
5
Really yummy sushi. Very authentic and delicious. We ordered from the menu as there was not much in the sushi train (5pm). We also had great waitresses who were attentive and delivered the food very fast. This is a must if you love sushi! Especially at affordable prices!! Will go again.

I stayed at the Fairmont in Raffles City and this restaurant was a convenient place to grab lunch and dinner being on the third floor of the complex. There may be a queue when you go, but it's quick and the staff are efficient in seating you. I sat at the bar, because I like the conveyor belt that you can pick and choose your sushi from. I also ordered on different occasions from their extensive menu including miso soup, tempuras, ten don, chicken teriyaki, a sushi platter and green tea ice cream for dessert. The menu is a bit overwhelming, because it has so many choices, but I guess it caters to everyone who enjoys Japanese cuisine. Knowing that it is a chain, I will look out for others around town
5
Really good variety, good quality sushi , very good value for money . The service is very efficient too . Trust the staff for recommendations , they do get it right on e you tell them what you are looking for
4
Ordered approximately 8-10 items off the menu with a friend and all dishes were consistently good across the board. Very good standard for the price, which is fair, in my opinion. I would visit again.
4
I really enjoyed this evening here the food was absolutely wonderful beautiful delightful and any other words to describe such wonderful delights.... I willlllll be back.
4
Located in Raffles City and next to my hotel made it a very convenient but good place to grab a late dinner after long day(s) in the office.Queues can be quite long but don't take too long to go down.Food is good, choice also very good. I prefer sitting at the belt in Sushi restaurants but the choice isn't always that extensive here so probably best to stick to menu options.If UK folks want a comparison then this is way better than somewhere like Yo Sushi but perhaps not as high end as other sushi houses (also not as expensive though) but it is in a shopping mall so which even in Singapore means something..
5
There are several Japanese restaurants on the basement floor of Raffles City, and it is a bit crowded. If you want to have lunch or dinner in more quite Japanese restaurant, then this Sushi Tei on 3rd floor (next to The Food Place) Raffles City is a good choice .. most of the meals are very delicious, salmon sashimi with sesame dressing, wakame salad, dai dai roll, Salmon/scallop Mentaiyaki, garlic fried rice, fried udon etc...It is a good place for lunch meeting as well... don't forget to try the black sesame ice cream as the dessert..The service is very good, only you have to queue up a bit to get the table..
5
We had a meal in this restaurant during our recent stay in Singapore and wish we had found it on our first evening there. The food was delicious and very reasonably priced. Being English we are not used to eating with chopsticks, but it was an interesting experience and we managed to eventually finish our meal, much to the amusement of two local ladies who were seated next to us. Ask for a booth rather that sitting at the counter as its a bit more private and I'm sure if you asked, they would provide something other than chopsticks. Still when in Singapore, eat like the locals - it is fun!
4
Maybe it s one of the best sushi chain in Sin. Good and fesh Japanese food. I dont know how the restaurant served other customers, but the service was always good for me. However, the restaurant is small and there are so many customers there. Therefore, you should book a table in advance, otherwise u must wait for the restaurant to arrange a table for you
1
Wanted to have dinner here with my boyfriend. Nobody received us at the front, we had to walked in. Then a waitress gave us a look (didn't even as or say anything). My boyfriend then said "for two". The waitress just walked in, so we followed her.We walked, and walked and kept walking. I was expecting a seat near the window, but there's no windows in the restaurant at all. It was dark and scary inside and the lighting didn't help. After walking inside for a while, I kid you not, the waitress brought us to the furthest corner of the restaurant, with a 50x50 cm table that is facing the wall. The table had exactly 2 seats and both seats are looking at the wall.I told waitress "is there no other table?"She didn't say anything and just turned back. She brought us to the other corner of the restaurant with equally sad table and lighting. I told my bf I don't have the appetite to eat there. Then we just left. All the waiters and waitresses we passed didn't even say anything, moreover checked what's wrong. Will not even consider to eat there ever again
5
I would say this is one of the best restaurant if you want sushi for your meal in Singapore. We ordered their special rolls, which are tasty and fresh. If you are Salmon lover, you will definitely like Aburi SalmonRoll ($12.80). Their rainbow roll ($13.80), which contains Yellow Tail, Bluefin Tuna, Salmon, Squid and Eel is great as well. My kids like the taste of mango on top of the large prawn sushi of their Golden Roll ($16.80). The Jumbo Yakitori ($6.80) here is a bit dry perhaps due to lack of soya sauce used - I preferred the more aromatic and flavourful version with generous amount of soya sauce at their i12 Katong and Takashimaya branches. The fried rice with crab meat ($13.80) was strong with garlic flavour and tasted really good when eaten while still piping hot! Services are generally okay and the food will be served relatively fast after the order has been taken. In order to offset the price premium for dining in this restaurant, you might want to consider signing-up their customer loyalty membership - you will get direct 10% off and use the membership vouchers straight away to offset the cost of your meal. You will also get to enjoy membership points, where you can accumulate and redeem for dining voucher everytime you dine with them. A good deal if you are a frequent visitor to this restaurant
3
I have eaten here countless times. The food is fresh but rather expensive, especially their noodles. This stuff is cheap in Singapore! But the absolute worst is the service. The person who seated me was abrupt and unfriendly. When I tried to place an order, I was met with the face of a hand instead of "I'll be right with you". I wasn't offered a drink. The person who tallied my plates up was downright rude. And don't get me started on the cashier. The only word she spoke was the money I owed
4
Food was really nice, staff very friendly. The items that were not at the conveyor belt could be ordered.
4
I went there twice during my last stay in Singapore. I tried the Lobster salad, different kinds of sushi - mostly different rolls of which I can definitely recommend their special rolls - and some variations of beef. Everything was really good. I went their both evenings around 9PM and still had to wait for about 10 minutes each time to get a table. The place is busy and at times it feels a bit like a fast food restaurant. Try to get a table instead of sitting at the conveyor belt - more quiet and more relaxing
4
I've enjoyed the food until the very last bite. It's my first time eating salmon sashimi because I'm not into raw food but it changed my mind when I've tasted the salmon sashimi that the serve it very delicious and fresh you can feel it on your tongue. I've tried also the fried rice, the soft shell crab, tofu, and sushi it was very delicious. One suggestion to make the food more affordable :) I will be coming back over and over again because I fell in love with the service and the food. Thank you. Keep it up.

Was there on a Sat evening for dinnerWaited about 30mins for a tableFood served was up to standard Price range acceptableBut when the last order came for us at 930pmWe ordered a plate of horse mackerel but when the food came it was the usual mackeral being served to usBy then, the kitchen was closed and the staff took back the plate of wrong order and cancelled the order for usStaff need to improve on their service such as verifying customer order Overall, worth a visit
1
I was enjoying my meal when, just after 9.30pm, it became obvious the staff were shutting up shop. Not only were the menus removed from the table, but I was asked if I needed any more of the condiments (wasabi, soy sauce etc,). I was in the middle of my meal - of course I needed them - it's a sushi restaurant. It would have been nice to be offered dessert at some point, but as it was 9.45 this wasn't going to happen. Efficiency taken too far!
5
Good:-Choose the tables at the side, they offer an intimate space, cosy for group chats.-Staff are very efficient, even if you are sitting at the tables.-Portions are generous.Bad:-Long wait during peak hours.-Toilet is far away.-During peak hour, the queue for the cashier is long
4
As I stayed and attended a conference at the Raffles city, this place was convenient. Wide options of sushi menu at reasonable prices. The quality of the food is quite nice. The service was fine for me. I looked at the fish more than the staff. My tea cup was always filled
1
landueli's review titled "“The most unfriendly staff”, unfortunately, I did not look at tripadvisor or his review before eating here tonight. Agree with him so much, am writing a review in my hotel right after dinner. Dinner on Saturday, March 2nd, paid a bill for 58.60 for 2 people a little after 8 30 PM. Rudest cashier. Asks for the amount to be paid, hands back change without a single word, let alone any sort of thank you. Low class lady.  And on top of that, the sushi is not worth the price, is under average quality, and sushi not sitting properly on rice/falls apart for the 2 nigiri sushi sets we ordered. Do yourself a favor, stay away from this place
1
A few days ago in Singapore I wanted to have my dinner at Sushi Tei raffles City. The way I was approached while some waiting cue, I decided to leave the place, they look for turnover and not for guests coming back again. I know the quality of the food, it is again not a great deal and rather on the expensive site. There are better choice
4
One of my fav Jap eateries in SG esp this one in raffles city. The other place i like is the City Sq outlet. It serves up fresh quality sashimi items and has lovely seasonal menus which i tried. I love the assort sashimi platters and cooked items like soft shell crab. They are better known for their sushi and sashimi items, not so much their ramen and bentos. There are other better restaurants for those in SG. Service is usually warm and friendly even when i have my toddlers with me. They do try and make you comfy. Can be abit difficult to get attention of servers esp when its weekends and lunch rush hour
