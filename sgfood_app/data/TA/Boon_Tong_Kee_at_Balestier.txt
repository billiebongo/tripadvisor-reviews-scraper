This place was full most of the time. Looked comfortable and nice, and had nice food for sure! Will be back.

This restaurant is always busy and often has a line at peak hour. The chicken rice is divine and so is their menu. We frequently come here as we live nearby. The staff is busy but still helpful.

Every time I go to Singapore. The MUST eat restaurant is Boon Thong Kee at Balestier. The food was very nice. I love chicken so much.
Highly recommend!!!

I ate here with my daughter because it's close to my hotel and after reading the review. I'm disappointed with this restaurant because the lady that served me was very impatient and want me to choose the food quickly although I'm not ready to order yet. I ordered their signature dish Hainanese Chicken rice and the chicken was cold. The other dish that I ordered was sweet and sour pork and prawn roll both taste ok only nothing special. They also charged me for a glass of warm water. I will never come to this restaurant again when I visit Singapore.

I must say I really like this chicken rice for a few reasons. One, the chicken is really tender. Two, it is extremely economical. The chicken for two people costs only sgd 10. Each bowl of delicious chicken rice costs only 60 cents. It is really rare to find such economical food in Singapore. This is one of the main reasons why I gave this a five-star rating. There was a queue when I went there at 6 pm. The queue system is well-organized. The restaurant though not a fancy one, puts in effort to make the place nicer by placing a gingham table cloth. thanks for that! There are other dishes you can order. We ordered kai lan with pork liver and steamed egg with minced pork.I cannot speak for other Boon Tong Kee outlets but the one at Boon Keng fell short of my expectations. This is a much better one. Skip Yet Con, come to Boon Tong Kee instead

One of the more popular Boon Tiong Kee outlets. Somehow, I find BTK's chicken a bit too oily compared to those serving kampong chicken. A bit pricey for chicken rice but given their relative fame and following plus semi-restaurant setting, it's ok if you want to spend a bit more for chicken rice and other side dishes
4
The Boon Tong Kee outlets are famous for its award winning chicken rice with homemade really spicy dip. My wife prefers the restaurant in Balestier Road and its welcoming hospitality. The Kailan with garlic is fantastic too. I wish they offered more options for vegetarians. Despite the restaurant is open from morning to late (4/4.30am) it s always pretty full. Reservation is highly recommended

Was there earlier today understanding that it's busy there as its 2 days before new year but the services there and the food was awful suddenly because of this Been here many times but this is the time which I felt the food wasn't that nice at all and so dry the chicken. Requested for more soy sauce on the chicken they just simply pour a little and said they ran out of it if you're going to be so stingy and charge $15 for chicken I suggest u don't even serve. Order an egg but tasted burnt , soup wasn't available when other days I visited at late night it's still available. Food don't seems to taste nice at all today I would say tasteless. ☹️

Boon Tong Kee at Balestier Located at 401 Balestier Road, Singapore. Boon Tong Kee Supposed to be of the top 10s most famous restaurant for Hainanese Chicken Rice in town ,and also offers some of the best Chinese cuisines in Singapore, serving a tantalizing collection of dishes that are suitable for group gatherings and casual dining, so there is something for everyone on the menu. I must say that I've tried most of the famous chicken rice in Singapore, and this one tops my list! It’s absolutely tasty, tender and juicy even for the chicken breast. The tze char, Braised Pig's Trotter and Fried Scallops with Seasonal Vegetables, are also amazing. Pitfall is that it can get quite pricey. But if you ask me, it's definitely worth it! On the other note the service staff were friendly and thoughtful, making our dining experience a memorable one. A very enjoyable lunch experience. Will definitely come back. Very soooon. Awesome!!
5
My friend recommend this restaurant as one of the top 2 chicken rice in Singapore and he is right. The chicken is tender and taste nice, especially with the sauce. The rice itself is superb, really tasty but not too oily. The Sambal Kangkong is really good, and not too spicy. Pricing is reasonable, ambience and services are basic. Be prepared to wait and queue for some time if you come during peak period of lunch and dinner. Highly recommended.

These place is very populair for turis. They favorite menu is chicken rice. But unfortunately they service is very unpleasant. No smile at all. Sorry
3
Just a quick dinner with the family. Busy but did not made a reservation. They speak poor English. A lot of choice on the menu. Unfortunately the duck was sold out. Pork was also great. Real quality for money.
4
We are in Singapore for a convention and our guide showed us this restaurant where they served traditional Chinese and Singaporean food. Their Hainanese chicken is very good and their beef tenderloin Chinese style is very soft and tasty. Must try!
5
A much-beloved national dish, the Hainanese chicken rice is made of three signature ingredients: fragrant pandan rice, roasted or poached chicken chuncks, and the unmissable chilli and ginger condiments.
4
This is one of the branches from which to eat their famous chicken rice. Worth a visit when you are in the area.

前回は、マックスウェルフードセンターの天天海南鶏飯でチキンライスを食べましたが、今回はこちらへ！1979年、チャイナタウンの屋台から始まった文東記さん。現在はシンガポール国内に8店舗を展開しています。こちらが本店のようですね。本店と言っても、チェックのテーブルクロスが敷かれたカジュアルな雰囲気です。お店への行き方は、店舗情報にGakuchiさんが詳しく書かれてますが、やっぱりタクシーが便利だと思います。ただし、帰りはなかなかタクシーが捕まえられなくて、ちょっと困りました。夕方の営業時間は17：30~。予約ができないので、18時までにはお店に行くことをお勧めします。17：30少し前に付きましたが、すでにお客さんが入っていました。確認すると、そのまま入店できました。ちなみに18時過ぎには満席でした。席に着くと、小鉢がのったトレーを持った店員さんが回ってきます。お通しのようですが、いらなければ断って大丈夫です。1つ2S$くらいみたいです。ちなみに卓上のお手拭きは有料です。チキンライスの有名なお店だと思っていたら、チキンライス以外のお料理もたくさんありました！メニューには番号が振られているので、注文はしやすいと思います。あと、おすすめ料理や辛いお料理もマークがついているのでわかりやすいですね♪●No.101/signature boiled chicken2人前 10S$￥830くらいです。多分、2人前だと思います。骨付きなので、少し食べにくいかもしれませんが、本当にしっとりしたやわらかい身に感動！黒い甘辛のソースより、辛口のチリソースの方が個人的には好きでした。●No.801/chicken rice 0.60S$￥50くらいです。小さなお茶碗なので、男性は2杯は食べられると思います。パラパラのご飯は、チキンライス独特の香りがしてたまりませんね♪●No.212/braised chinese cabbage with dried scallops 15S$￥1245くらいです。干した帆立、キャベツ、干しシイタケ、中国湯葉を蒸して、上から熱々のあんをかけたお料理。見た目は地味ですが、優しい塩味と帆立やシイタケの風味がとてもおいしいです！●No.403/stuffed bean curd4個 10S$￥829くらいです。4個からの注文ですが、追加は1個2.5S$でできます。見た目はお肉だけですが、下にお豆腐が敷かれています。これも、味が濃すぎなくていいですね！●No.102/Paper wrappad chicken4個 6S$￥500くらいです。友人がガイドブックに載っていたと言うので、注文をしてみました。味付けした鶏肉を紙に包んで揚げてあります。紙に包まれているので、肉汁が閉じ込められるのですね。照り焼きチキン系かと思いきや、かなりアルコールの強い味でした。●カールスバーグ640ml 11S$ビールがあってよかった♡本当は土鍋御飯（Claypot rice)も注文したかったけど、注文は18：30~でした・・・。仕方がないので、土鍋御飯の素をスーパーで買ったみかりんこでした（笑どのお料理もおいしくて大満足！物価の高いシンガポールでは良心的な価格だと思います

I have frequent very often to the Boon Keng branch of Boon Tong Kee and yesterday I went to the main shop at Balestier which was as usual fully packed with diners. It was a short wait for the the 2 of us. When I browsed through the menu was delighted to find a different version of zi char dishes and more choices are served. We had their signature Chicken, braised cabbage with dried scallop and a steam black mullet (Teochew Style) which I highly recommended, were simply delicious and reasonably priced. I definitely will go back to this main shop to try more of the other ‘complement ‘ dishes and of course their signature Chicken and rice which I found more tender and less oily respectively. Well done and do keep up the good standard 
4
The steamed chicken is great and tender. The crispy skin tofu is nice too. The steamed egg is perfect while the seafood bee hoon is one of the best around. Service staff is mostly attentive but the food took awhile to come, otherwise it will be perfect
2
This used to be one of the best place in town for Hainanese chicken rice and is a favourite amongst locals. Took a foreign visitor plus local friends out and it was a mistake: the famous chicken was half cold / half warm. No fish that night and the other cooking was forgettable. Will not go back again...

Singapore is famous for the legendary chicken rice. Competition is stiff and neck crunching.After years of tasting various cuisine, self cooking and studying, chicken rice can be broken down in 3 key areas:1) the rice. Soft, wholesome, and tasty. Not too oily, but fragrant enough to smell the whiff of chicken oil residue.2) the chicken. The litmus test is the breast meat. Too tough is means overcooked. Skin too thick means wrong chicken used. Too much oil on it means chicken is too fatty3) The chilli. Must pack a good short punch. Must not be too watery that it cannot coat the chicken, and must be of constant viscosity to mix with dark soy sauce for the avid.Boon Tong Kee surpass in all 3. Needless to say. The best white chicken rice in the whole of Singapore (for less than 7 USD per person
4
One of my favor restaurant in Singapore . Great food , excellent service , and reasonable price .
Highly recommended for people travel to Singapore who wants to try local specialties.
5
We ordered chicken rice, it tastes similar with the legend Mandarin chicken rice. Big portion, fast service. We're very satisfied
5
We discovered this stretch on one our casual aimless stroll. You can start either at the Thompson Road end or the corner of Jalan Raja Udang (King Prawn Road). Boon Tong Kee is one of the better known eateries serving excellent Singapore Chicken Rice. There are many other options for various Malay and Chinese fare. The place is also famous for the Art Deco shophouses dotting the entire stretch. A highly recommended evening walk ending in fabulous dinner
4
Very crowded place but don't have to wait long to get a seat. Noisy as well. Food is nice but not much service.. It took us a while to get our additional rice. Typical Traditional Chinese restaurant.. Just go for the good food! Pricing is on the high side
5
we were 4 non-Singaporeans (myself a Filipino, 2 Indonesians, 1 New Zealander) and our Singaporean friend. the restaurant is everything you'd expect from a neighborhood Chinese restaurant: noisy surroundings (i really believe Chinese restaurants intentionally have acoustically reflective surfaces), quick delivery of your order, very tasty dishes. parking was available behind the restaurant
4
Steamed white chicken is a favorite in this restaurant but the roasted chicken to me as tastier and perfect with the hiananese rice and dipping sauces, the Kangkong with Sambal was very good and I loved the fried crunchy on the outside and soft inside tofu bites! Wonderful lunch
4
Went there at late mid-night 02:15hrs after check-in at IBIS HOTEL NOVENA as local food market has already stopped for ordering.Escorted by waiter to table, waiter presented a small dish of an assorted vegetable to table for me but I rejected; read from the menu that the vegetable was cost of SGN $2.00.Started to order, checked with waiter that the white steam chicken is similar to Hanna Chicken style so order a small portion of SGN $10.00 for half portion was SGN$15.00 and a bowl of rice of SGN $0.60.Chicken was delicious with soy sauce and oily steam rice were delicious it was good for two people for late supper.Restaurant also provided wet towel and cost of SGN $0.3 per pieces as a small tips / income for the restaurant.Tea price of SGN $2.50 for table. Finally, it cost of SGN 13.70 plus 17% service charge for the bill of SGN $16.10 since service charge and tea price had already added so no extra tip was needed to be given for dining
5
Was recommended by a friend who has lived here before and the chicken rice experience did not disappoint! Air conditioning, open late and the menu seems quite extensive. Really well attended by locals and some visitors, very busy, and a line up to get in so was very impressed
4
After speaking to some locals about food they said you must try the Chicken Rice they said Singapore is the only place to try it along with Chilli CrabSo we found the best place for Chicken Rice and gave it a go well don't waste any time if your in the area of Mr Thain Boon Hua place drop in but be patient they don't speak English All part of the fu
3
Just went there recently for a family lunch, I have pretty high expectation for the famous Hainam Chicken Rice after a close relative recommended how good this franchise was, but after meal I was a little bit disappointed about the chicken tenderness, smoothness and savory, I personally think this restaurant is overrated by media and social websites.
4
Boon Tong Kee have lot of outlets by only this one at Balestier have the best tasty foods. just don't know what the reason. And I like the environment here too.
5
Everything is so delicious. The roasted chicken is worth the 30 minutes wait. The crispy beancurd and hainan rice is also excellent.
4
Vegetarian food is available if you look carefully at the menu. Portions are generous. Not exactly economical, but great value for money.
5
My friends took us there, really delicious. Yummy. Suggest order the white chicken with chicken oil rice and prawn roll.
4
Had dinner on a sunday evening for 5 pax. Was not aware that the restaurant has 2 flrs and since the ground floor was quite full, we went to the 2nd flr. Turned out to be a big mistake as there are 2 large tables seated with guests from a foreign country that were drinking beer and making a lot of noise. They were clearly oblivious to the frustration created to diners seated on other tables, despite our frequent stares directed at them. The waiters also did not do anything about it but just kept shaking their heads. Thankfully, this unpleasant situation is compensated by the great food that was served to us. We ordered their signature white chicken, lotus root soup, spinach with 3 eggs vege, fried green beans, frog leg with onion and the yam cake with seafood and of course the chicken rice. Very satisfied with the quality of the food. Bill came to $150/-, which is reasonable.Will be back, but will be careful to ensure that there are no rowdy diners around.
3
Delectable Singaporean food - Hainanese Chicken with rice on the side, creamy bean curd, fried spare ribs, salted egg-covered shrimps, glutinous mochi etc. Place a little tight. Not much elbow room when it's packed so best to reserve a place at the back of the room or near the door
4
There are two famous chicken rice places along Balestier and we picked BTK as it was nearer to the hotel we were staying at for our staycation. The place was crowded when we went there for lunch. I saw several tour buses bringing in bus loads of tourist who dine in the private roomsUpstairs of restaurant. The restaurant was clean and strong air conditioning. Food was presented fairly quick and served pipping hot. We ordered chicken/prawn rolls/ salted fish with beansprouts and 4x rice and barley drink and 2 tea which costs us $44. The chicken rice and meat was yummy but the prawn roll was too floury for me and the sprouts too oily. But still satisfied with the main of fragrant chix rice and yummy chilli sauce. Bring a visiting friend I am sure they will enjoy it.
3
1 of 4 most recognize CHICKEN RICE in Singapore, but i feel it was over estimated for it.I don't find it worth for what i paid for.Yes, the services is good, the environment is good, but i'm here for the Chicken and the Rice.The chicken was serve in cold, and the rice is not really warm while i put into my mouth.Sorry, i will never come back again for my own preference
5
I can recommend BTK very much. I love their very fragrant rice. The chicken, too, of course. And the chilli is house-made.It can get a little noisy when it's full and you're sitting by the door close to the street but the food is worth it
5
Im a typical singaporean and i love my chicken rice.If you're a visitor to Singapore and want to try authentic chicken rice --this is the place. Just hop into the cab and say " Boon Tong Kee at Balestier Road".Order the white chicken, roasted siced pork (we call it "Char Siew"), and go with the chicken rice (not plain plse). Dip the chicken with the red chillie) --trust me it's heaven!A meal for two, with the chcken , char siew, plus two other dishes will cost about SS$70 to S$100
5
Had a late night dinner here in Feb2017. Awesome quality on chicken rice and special soup. A must try for any chicken rice lover. Great price too.
5
My go to place for chicken rice.
Rice, flavour & taste very consistent.Chicken soft and smooth. Their 3 types eggs with spinach is yummy, Steam fish gravy appetizing
5
After spending 9 days in japan, the first meal I had was our Singaporean comfort food chicken rice. Service was extremely warm and food was served very fast. Nothing can go wrong with BTK!
4
I was recommended to come here by several friends. The steamed chicken rice is nice. It's meat is very tender. The dish is accompanied by it's fragrant rice and condiments. There was a slight queue when I came but it seemed to move quite quickly. If you're near the area, it's not too bad. Don't think I'd return for a repeat visit as the neighborhood does have a lot more stuffs to try
3
Famous for chicken rice and ample parking at the carpark behind, as opposed to the river valley branchOrdered the chicken rice, plus ngoh hiang, crispy beancurd and sweet/sour soup. The chicken rice and ngoh hiang were good, the beancurd blah and the soup disappointing$31 per person so pretty moderate pricin
5
I can't resist the dishes there - chicken rice is a must and the other local dishes are great too! The staffs are nice and make great recommendations! It is unusual that we have 2 out of 3 dinners at the same restaurant for a short leisure trip but it is too good to give it a miss. We will definitely come back again even stop-over for transit!!
4
I am not the chicken rice lover. However, I would like to recommend this place to all the chicken rice lovers. The rice and chicken are cooked just about right. So you don't need to add anything on. The other dishes are also very tasty. You don't need to believe me, but you should try it
5
Was in Balestier and decided to have chicken rice.... so naturally came to boon tong Kee.Place is very clean and the service was very prompt. Taste and quality of food are excellent. The space is quite limited though and had to wait for a while to get a table... about 15 mins.My wife and I had the steam chicken, braised soya sauce pork, bean sprouts, kangkong sambal belacan, fish maw soup.Highly recommended
2
This restaurant is reputed to have one of the best chicken rice in town. Thus it was no surprise that I brought my overseas visitors there for chicken rice. Our intention was to have a simple chicken rice meal. But the waitress kept asking us to reduce the steamed chicken portion and order other dishes, as if she wasn't convinced that their chicken rice would satisfy us. However, we still insisted on a whole chicken and 2 other vege dishes.The 2 side dishes were served and we had to wait quite a while for the chicken. Considering that the chicken was cold (chilled), I was surprised on the wait. We were disappointed with the rice, the rice was poor quality broken rice, not befitting that of a well known brand. The rice was also a bit hard, not fragrant or fluffy like the other chicken rice stall just down the same road. Furthermore, we had to request for ground ginger sauce which should be part of chicken rice package.A good chicken rice consist of 3 parts, chicken, rice and its accompaniment. I would say the chicken is okay, but the meat temperature too chilled. The rice is below standard, chilli/ginger combination good. So I will give this restaurant a below average rating, should improve to live up to their brand
4
Have been eating this for years, since I was young, and the taste has largely remained constant. The 白斩鸡 is a must try, the chilli paste and ginger paste are some of the best I have ever eaten. Price-wise, it might be slightly costly - more expensive than some other restaurants/ahops specializing in hainanese chicken rice, but surely worth the money
4
The good was good but you better go there before 6pm as the line is quite Long afterwards especially weekends.
4
All the dishes are recommended by the captain. Surprisingly, they are so delicious, each with its own unique flavour. I would say the chicken is the best. Cooked to perfection, smooth and juicy.
5
It was in 1991 that my boss first took me to this restaurant. He made it a point to stopover in Singapore for a couple of nights on our way back from Perth to Bangkok. His only reason to visit Singapore was "the" chicken rice at Boon Tong Kee @ Balestier Road. It must have been the only branch they operated back then. I had never eaten Hainanese Chicken so juicy and tender. I was hooked since then. No one cooked chicken rice the way they did.I had literally just landed in Bangkok from Singapore after our 3 days trip. Twenty-five years later, I found myself taking my son to this place. He seemed to have enjoyed the Hainanese Chicken Rice at this place even more than I do. Boon Tong Kee -- you have won hands down
4
I went to Balestier market around 11:00am and there were already full of local ppl. I found one seat available luckily and had this soup. The taste was good but needed more salt to make it tasty. However, here Balestier is a good place to feel Singapore and you can choose one plate from all those kinds of Asian food. 10 mins taxi ride to the city, but here is a local place that you would enjoy
5
Waited in line to be seated, but it was worth the wait. Service was prompt and friendly. The prices were reasonable. We enjoyed boiled chicken and fried long beans with beancurd cubes & nuts immensely. The surprisingly delicious dish was the Cantonese chicken rice -- order it, and you won't be sorry
5
Boon Tong Kee has been around since I was a child. It has become a cult food that has spanned four generations of my family. It is definitely the best chicken rice ever around. We've tried virtual every other but Boon Tong Kee's consistency and uniques also held its own. A must try, must go to
4
Still at Balestier Rd and now at a more upmarket Chinese restaurant having their signature disk boiled chicken. Extremely tender and fairly priced for a portion at $5. I had lovely small portion of pork, great chicken rice and a fantastic bean sprout salad with nuts. All enjoyed with a few Tiger beers. Only downside was my ex wife texting me and questioning how many Asian women I have had. No comments
5
Their chicken rice, cod fish with fungus, venison, duck are out of this world. It's open till very late and the quality of food is always great.If you are new or old or visiting, this place is a must to experience the real Singaporean delight
1
We were told that this was the world famous chicken rice place by our Uber driver so we thought we would give it a go, big mistake, the food was very average and the staff were rude, they tried to charge us for the paper towel we did not use and they have a mandatory 10% service charge, what a joke. Our advise is to go next door to the 24 hour food market
3
Boon Tiong Kee Chicken Rice started as a small store and I must say the food is really good. However, ever since they renovated a couple of years back the price went up a lot for the same dishes I ordered. They have since increase the number of dishes in their menu but I felt the price is too steep. If you really want to taste Singapore's chicken rice, I would recommend that you hop over to the food centre which is located just beside Boon Tiong Kee. The taste is just as good but the price is what any average Singaporean would pay... Less then SGD 6 !!!
3
The restaurant could be said to have average food court, hawker food but overpriced bills when it comes to adding total of titbits and tea. Overrated !
5
Price quite premium for a chicken rice but kinda tasty compare to other chicken rice. Ordered a full set of chicken rice the price around $5-$7 but pretty good
5
We had a meal here at 3am after dumping our suitcases at the hotel. We had a great meal with fried rice, chicken rice and some vegetables. Very nice food!
5
Not only do they have one of the best steamed chicken in town, their dishes are also very good. Try the Spare Rib and Deep fried tofu, they are my family's dishes.
4
Great place for tastin Singaporean food.
Chicken rice is amazing.
Basic service but extremely efficient.
5
The best chicken rice in singapore. This outlet has very good dining environment, air con. However, sometimes can be quite crowded and need to wait for seating
4
The best dish is the chicken rice! The rice is fragrant and the chicken succulent. The chili sauce, ginger and soya sauce which accompanies the dish is great! This is what makes the chicken rice good. The other dishes you can eat are the kailan in oyster sauce and tofu among others BUT the chicken rice is what you MUST eat.The drawback at this restaurant is that you MUST be prepared to wait. At peak hours three quarters of an hour is not unusual. The ambience is like any Singapore coffee shop, although this place is airconditioned, which makes the place more bearable
5
Soft chicken and aromatic chicken oil rice of exceptional quality. I love the checkered table cloth! Although boon tong kee is famous for chicken rice, the clientele are mostly locals who order cantonese dishes instead of only chicken rice like the tourists. I hope a branch can be opened near orchard road.
1
I have visited this place several times for take always and the staff (middle aged lady) was always attending to the cashier and unfriendly. She would always chat non stop with the person chopping chicken and mess up the orders.Every single order of requesting to be boneless would be ignored, and upon enquiry she would not reply and simply ask the person to debone the chicken that had already been chopped into pieces (with bones).End up I will always be eating minced chicken drumstick with random crushed bones
3
The kitchen standards have declined since our last visit. There wasn't even the faintest whiff of wok hei to be found in the bean curd in crab sauce. The spinach in 3 eggs stock fared slightly better. Worst of all was the pork braised with mooi choi. That was so dry and tasted like jerky.
3
The chicken part of the famous "Chicken Rice" was good. Not satisfied though with the rice part, can be cooked and served a little bit better. There are lots of competition offering the same dish better.
5
All the food we ordered tasted really really really good. Especially the steamed chicken. Avoid rush dining hour to avoid long queue (really long and tiring)
2
Employees don't smile don't talk and gives sulky face. You order you eat you leave. What is happening to BTK? If you like chicken rice, this is the place. Don't expect service.
5
Just visited last night. The place was crowded. Went with my wife, had to wait about 15 mins to get in. Ordered Chicken Rice, Tofu and Spinach with 3 eggs.
Loved the food.
5
I was brought to this restaurant while on business; Had lunch at Boon Tong Kee, Balestier Road.We had steamed "kampong" (old village) chicken, steamed Hong Kong style Carp fish head, braised abalone with sea cucumber, fish maw, prawns, and shintake mushrooms, tradisional spiced seafood soup, stir-fry kailan and chicken rice.The food were exceptionally delicious and flavourful. It was truly a wonderful treat.I particularly loved the chicken rice, the "kampong" chicken, and the steamed Carp fish head. They are among the famous signature dishes from the restaurant.Be sure to make reservations as the restaurant gets filled up by 12:00 pm
4
I wasn't able to visit this place even though it is very near to where we are staying - ibis Novena. However, my husband went there and had a take away. One order of chicken rice. You can hear Boon Tong Kee from almost everyone and read it from almost everywhere as one of the places you have to visit and try their food. However, I was not fully satisfied with what I had. I have tried Chicken Rice from other restaurants during our stay in Singapore but some are better. Theirs is just normal for me. Nothing so special in what they are offering
4
They are best known for their chicken rice. I can't dispute that as I still relish their fluffy, fragrant rice.But what makes the Balestier branch special is the wide range of dishes on their menu - from chilli crab to yam ring.It dawned on me that this is actually a good place to bring visitors. Not only do they get try the famous Singapore chicken rice, but also a host of other delectable dishes. Balestier is also an interesting area for the jaded tourist.
3
We were introduced by locals to try out the famous boon tong kee chicken rice as they said it was really good, but turn out to be: it was quite an average chicken rice to be found in singapore as we have found better ones. The price is slightly higher than the outside ones but the portion was reasonable. The chicken is averagely smooth but can be done better. The chilli paste was the winner though, a great combination with the dark soy sauce and ginger paste. Overall, i won't be trying out twice for this. Hawker stalls still taste better.
4
This is the main store of a chain of chicken rice restaurants. Well managed, clean and tidy. Aside from chicken rice, they also have a good range of chinese/local dishes. The deep fried bean curd is very popular.The chicken rice is quite good standard. But there are lesser known stalls that cooks a better chicken rice, like Seng Kee at Mei Ling market. But this is probably easier to get to and most taxi drivers will know it.Recommended if you are looking to sample a Singaporean dish. If you are more adventurous than a bit of research may find you something even better
4
Well presented restaurant more upmarket than some in the area. Not the cheapest food but very well cooked. All facilities were very clean. Initially we thought the service was poor but then realised there was a buzzer on each table to call the waiter ! Big choice of traditional food including frog if you like ! Expect to pay $20-30 plus alcohol.
5
I had an excellent dinner here when family took me to celebrate chinese new year. I had my first taste of raw seafood salad with abalone! Great Hainan chicken. You can reserve a table on the 2nd floor by booking ahead. Worth a visit.
4
Taste good but not fantastic. I prefer the Bukit Timah branch that serves rice in pyramid style and fried tofu with wasabi tartar sauce. Not as good here but still generally not bad
5
This restaurant serves the best chicken rice in singapore. Not too expensive. It is air conditioned. Nice enviroment for business lunch or dinner
5
This is one of the must visit list on your next trip to Singapore, although you must take a cab to visit. The chicken rice is phenomenally good, tender, juicy. You gotta try it. Highly recommended
3
They offer chicken rice and bak kut teh and others favorite family dishes. Their flavors are great but prices are higher vs others.
4
been here yesterday for lunch with colleagues....ordered chicken rice...sweet sour pork....spinach with eggs...house blend ice tea....
price is ok.
3
There are not many good chicken stall in Today's Singapore! The main reason are either the good one closed down due to high rental cost or demised of founder of the stall or simply no one taking over the business or skillOld name stall still surviving like Boon Tong Kee already passed down to younger generation, thus the taste also changes. On top of this stall that turned into a restuarant, not only chicken rice is served, you can order other dishes from the menu which I find, distracting.Personally, I think the taste have changed, is no longer as tasty as it used to but for foreigners who like to have a taste of "Singapore" chicken rice, you can still try Boon Ting Kee. As for the locals, we have better place to go for true taste chicken rice - nicer and cheaper but may not come with airconditioner
4
I will always bring my foreign friends here to try authentic Singapore's chicken rice. Reasons: air-conditioned place (comfortable enough for elderly to enjoy their meal), yummy chilli (we all have very high expectations for chicken rice chilli), good value for money and a wide variety of other Chinese dishes. Location is convenient as well, with bus stops nearby.Must try: char siew appetizer, steamed egg, sambal kang kong.PS: The service is really slow

Very Good Restaurant with very good taste and reasonable price. I Love it so much when i come to singapore i'm trying to have time to come to this restaurant. They also serve many kind of menu. But the Chicken rice taste is very delicious for me. Must Try Restauran

Chicken Rice is a dish that can be found at many food courts around Singapore, but Boon Tong Kee, is known as one of the pioneers of its success in Singapore. There are a number of stores around Singapore.On arrival it was not very busy and crowded as some said it would. To be honest, I've been past the restaurant a few times in the past and haven't seen really big crowds waiting for tables. Was shown to the table politely and shown the menu, and given today's special offer of the daily pork soup. I declined but saw the staff were pushing this quite hard to other guests too.Chose the iconic Chicken rice and added a side dish of fried tofu. It wasn't too bad, but I couldn't see how it was anything special. It tasted like any other chicken rice I have tried around Singapore. The fried tofu was done quite nicely. thin crispy outside with very soft inner texture.They did have stir fried venison rice noodles that I wanted to try also, but couldn't really as I was on my own.A little on the pricey side for chicken rice, and even regular water is charged, although I know its like this in other places around Singapore. Service was fair and was as expected

Will come every time in Singapore. Love their hainan chicken, deep fried tofu (crispy out & soft inside), the BBQ pork is free but too fat & too oily.
The hot pot chicken rice taste good & need 45 mins waiting time.
3
I had a dinner with my friends at Boon Tong Kee on Balestier street. We ordered some dishes, and the chicken rice was good at such competitive prices. The staff should be more friendly with guests in the queue.
4
No wonder why people think this place is a must for chicken rice lover! the chicken is so juicy and tender with a great taste! Also the fried tofu! you should order that too!
4
My Singaporean friend brought me to this specific one because he said not every Boon Tong Kee is same. The chicken especially leg was so good but other dishes were fair.
4
Tasty food, good without being amazing. Popular at about 8:30pm, both upstairs and down was full. Enjoyed our evening
5
Good restaurant and Good chinese food. It's located at balestier road and it's quite famous for its chicken rice. I particularly love the claypot rice and the chicken rice, I guess thats because i have not tried all of their menus.Their service time is also accomodating since they are open from 11AM right through to 4AM. They basically cover all meal time except breakfast. So, if you are a night owl and good for non halal food, must try
4
Very famous restaurant, go for the chicken rice and the fish head other dishes average. Service average, they tend to push you to order other dishes. Can be very crowded. No booking allowed even when restaurant not crowded, go to the restaurant and they will give you number to wait for tabl
4
Chicken rice was good, fried rice was ok.The chicken rice is really the star in this restaurant. They are famous for it. People are queuing during dinner time, expect to wait minimum of 15 minutes. We decided to get the take away, since the line was quite long.
4
We came to this place on the recommendation of a taxi driver. We ordered the famous Hainanese chicken rice. The chicken was very smooth and tender, and all the bones have been removed. The rice was cooked with chicken broth. It was very rich in flavour and we loved it so much. The service of the restaurant was fast and the servers were friendly. We will come again
4
The staffs are so friendly. They guide us though the menu patiently and make recommendations. There is queue outside, but we didn't feel any rush from the staffs. They serve us professionally. The chicken RICE is so delicious. Full of flavour. The chicken, eggplant, tofu m, etc are all good. In Singapore for short trip, three days. Been visited this shop for two times.
4
i found that the menu was average
but...the taste was amazing
hahahhahahahahah
and suit for the price
you must try the rootbeer
superrbbb
2
This place serves average chicken rice. Other dishes ranges from fair to average. With more tourist coming to this place, I try to avoid as it may be difficult to get a table.
5
Boon Tong Kee is a Chicken Rice Restaurant in Singapore. The Food Is Great And Must Try. Try to avoid busy times in the resaturant
5
I enjoyed having boiled chicken with rice here! The chicken is sofe and tender with a good combination of the rice...makes my mouth water!!!
4
You have to fight the tourists who descend on this in the busloads. Best to have sn early dinner. The chicken rice is unmemorable. But the other items on the menu are great. Good Cantonese chef at the helm.
4
Original boiled chicken is a great taste. BBQ pork and Oster sauce vegetables are so so. Very recommend for chicken rice.
3
We came here after reading so many reviews about this place. However, I was a bit disappointed to see the slow service (the auntie who served us was very polite, but the chicken took 15 minutes to arrive). When the food did arrive, I noticed :1. The portion is really appropriate for the money spent. (I ordered the $10 portion for me and my wife) 2. The chicken is a bit on the bland side. I'm sure it's very subjective, but I must say that I prefer Tian2's. 3. The chili is very fragrant and very subtle. It is one of the best chili I've ever tasted. 4. The rice. Oboy, this one is really delicious. It is so fluffy and tasy, yet it is not soggy or mushy. 5. The soy sauce poured over the chicken was very good also. All in all, I would return here again. Not for the chicken. Next time, I will try their sweet and sour pork instead. ($12 as of this time of writing)
3
Just getting seated will set you back $5+ from the obligatory boiled peanuts, pickles, and wet towelettes. Came for dinner and found a queue waiting to get in but later found many were picking up their takeaways. We sat on the 2nd floor dining room and the service was very good however, the food arrived at our table sporadically making the dinner awkward as we waited in between dishes, especially the last dish which came as we were about finished. Ordered steamed eggs (3 different kinds of eggs), side pork with mui choy, stuffed tofu, and famous steamed chicken. The stuffed tofu never made it out to us. Was later told that it was not available ... okkkkkay. We didn't originally ordered the chicken but the waitress was shocked that we didn't and convinced us into adding it, and was glad she did - juicy, flavorful and good portions. Menu was easy to read and catergorized. Will be back to try the many other dishes
4
We had early dinner at this restaurant in a large group and we were ushered to the first floor. It was pre-arranged and the menus were chosen based on the popularity. As the booking had been made earlier, the foods arrived quite fast. The sought-after chicken did not disappoint and it was as good as expected. Other dishes were good as well. Judging from the waiting crowd, it can be assumed that this is a highly popular restaurant especially for its Hainanese Chicken Rice. It is worthwhile to give it a try if time permits.
4
Being a Hongkonger, there are so much that I love especially because I don't live in Hong Kong anymore. We went with a 4 year old and a 1 year old, have to say not the best combo. The staff is all very nice and friendly to the children. Now let's get to the food, all food we ordered was yum. We had some chicken (of course) and chicken rice, sweet & sour pork, veg with golden & silver eggs, fried egg with prawns. Sadly I couldn't get more special stuff because of my companies. Definitely get there as early as you can to beat the crowd. We got here at 5:40pm and by 6:15pm there were so much people outside waiting already! And there were 2 floors in the restaurant! Would love to go back with more people.
5
As usual my favorite place for Hainanese chicken rice and was not dissapointing service was much better than my last visit.Open till late night
4
One of the most authentic (and tasty) Chicken Rice you can have in Singapore.
Fast and attentive service. Polite and friendly staff.
5
Wow! What a place, what an institution! Service + meals were fantastic. Very well presented and lovely meal.
4
Boon Tong Kee is a well established restaurant famous for Hainanese Chicken Rice. It does serve many other dishes including steamed fish, Cantonese roast meat etc. It also have a simple wine menu with some supermarket type of wine. It is not cheap ( nothing is cheap for visitors due to strong Sing dollar ) but good quality...
5
Another authentic and not to be missed Singaporean restaurant. The food is awesome and you'll never have enough of it. The hainanese rice is perfect with the combination of those juicy steamed chicken. Add another melted froed tpfu and piched spinach will add to your satisfaction. The place is packed all the time and it has a nice atmosphere to dine with family. Worth to go all the tim
5
One of the must try chicken rice restaurant in Singapore. For half chicken is only SGD$13. The chicken oil rice is so so so so good. I open till 03:00. I would come back here again when I have chance to Singapore in the near futur
4
I heard about this restaurant for many years, but I just had a chance to try. It was a bit far from central area, so we took the cab there. We did arrive the restaurant at noon and found that we were lucky to beat the crowds.The chicken and rice were good as people said. Anyway, it's probably not the best chicken rice for me. I will have try other places to compare and I may know how good it is here
5
Since I bought Singapore Explorer Pass thru Silk Air, and it was 50th Anniversary of Singapore. Thus, I got special benefit for a complimentary dish of Chicken Rice and Barley drink. However, my 3 friends and I ordered some more food like Peking Duck, vegetables soup, fried green vegetable and a few more dishes. I wanted too order more but the waitress was nice enough and suggested us not to order too many dishes because the dish was quite big and we could not finish them all. And, that's true.. We could not finish them all. The portion was big and food was delicious. I would come back here again when I have a chance to Singapore in the future
1
2 times in a row within one week i visit balestier last week with friend and my family. First time was good. The senior aunty with fantastic service. She recommend to my friend so call 'the exercise and non exercise chicken ' even joke with us around. Second time is totally disaster. The heavy make up auntie stop me from ordering half chicken when i just did my order of small portion of normal chicken. And when I test her by asking suckling pig at 1pm. She even told me to look at the menu with timing (which nothing stated there). She did not do any recommendation at all and only like robot take ordering. This actually spoil our mood totally and I absolutely will not visit again
3
It has been a long time since I had it, so I decided to travel a bit for it. The service is fast and good, but what happened to the taste? Nothing like what it used to be. The chicken is tasteless and a bit too hard and the rice has no fragrance at all. I think some coffee shops in neighbourhoods serve better chicken rice. I hope it's my bad luck yesterday that the food is not nice ,if not, there is really no reason to go back
4
My wife and I ordered boiled chicken and one soup (could not remember the name) with chicken rice for our lunch, all are so tasty at reasonable price
5
One of the best restaurant to serve the chicken rice. Very tasty, it was amazing how the order taker, a lady, did take job very efficiently, and gave us some other food recommendation. Keep the good works !
4
I stayed at Ibis Novena, and you need just walked to reach this restaurant. Good Food, tasty chicken rice. And I think the service especially the order taker, the lady, did her job efficiently. Definitely will be back
2
I always visit this outlet for about once a week. However, On my this revisit, I felt that the service had dropped quite a lot. There are different waitress wearing black and white uniform. Those black uniformed waitress are mostly all with very 'blacked face and unfriendly at all. Seeing their face would make you think that you owe them money... However, on the other hand I would like to praise those slightly 'Elderly' waitress in white uniform. They are very very very friendly and attentive and did all their best in service and with all smiles. Thumbs up for the white uniform waitress! and also their trainee staff is also more friendly than the main staffs. Food wise the standard is still very good. Was just very disappointed on the service
4
My family had a craving for chicken rice and we headed here for lunch.It was a Saturday and there was a queue of customers. We took 20 mins to get a table. We had:- Half White Boiled Chicken: $15. The chicken were chopped up into good sized chunks and the chicken was succulent and tender. It came with sliced Japanese long slim cucumbers, not the kind you get at most chicken rice stalls. A good surprise and it was crunchy and nice. The chicken was drizzled with their chicken rice soy sauce seasoning and came with chili sauce and dark soya sauce. The chili sauce was spicy and piquant.- Deep fried Handmade Prawn Roll: $3/ piece. Min 3 pieces. This is a spring roll with prawns in it. My children and I liked it. The filling is tasty. Will definitely order this again next time.- Chicken Rice: $0.60 per bowl. The rice is fragrant and delicious. I can eat this on its own.A satisfyingly good meal.We spent $30. Highly recommended
4
I visited this place repeatedly since 2010. My favorite dishes here =>No.1 Rice which full of herbs smell such as Ginger, coriander roots, coriander seeds and pepper. /No.2 Roasted chicken which full of flavor and skin crispy /No.3 The Imperial pork ribs always excellent. The veggies dishes tried a few different of them and turn out all Good. Tips for first time visit : steam nut they put on table is Not a complementary it's 2.5$ /Wet tissue 0.5$ per each. The nut taste wasn't justify for price and wet tissue charge kinda silly in my opinions.
4
When I was only spending one night in Singapore before I would fly to Indonesia I ate in this restaurant. They are very popular with locals. I w2as already sitting and eating, but in the meantime there was a line of people outside waiting to get a table. The staff handled this very efficiently. Constantly when a table became free they walked outside and asked how many people were in the comapnies waiting and people were seated accordingly. The food is good value for your money, Nice asian food, tasty
4
Their Balestier outlet is still the go to place of this joint if we want to have chicken rice. They have a good spread of other dishes to go with the rice. However, we do find the standard drop. On that night, we had one whole roast duck, the skin was crispy but the meat was rough, not sure is it due to the wrong cut of the meat. The white chicken was fat, tender & smooth. This time round, the rice not fragrant. The mixed platter was not too bad. Spinach with 3 kinds of eggs was good, vegetables very soft. Koo luo Yok this round was not so tasty, not enough sauce. Fish Maw soup diluted not thick, not enough Ingredients. Need improvements
4
I went to Boon Tong Kee on my first day in Singapore. It was known as one of the most delicious chicken rice in Singapore, well, at least that’s what my friend told me. So, we went there. Around 700 meters walk from Hostel Lah where I stayed. It was near to dinner time, around 6ish and the place was full! Lucky us to get an empty table.We ordered Chicken steamed large portion (for 5 people) and rice. What I like with the rice in Singapore of course because it’s different and more oily (we usually call it Hainan rice). The chicken was so soft! I really like the taste of the rice anyway and the cucumbers were so fresh and crunchy. I recommend you to give a try if you visit Singapore
4
Chicken rice is one of the bestChicken is tender, fragrant & tasty at a reasonable price.The vegetables are also recommended due to its taste and value. Both the spinach with 3 egg and the sambal kangkong is good. Loved the cereal prawn. Big fresh, juicy prawns and the cereal is yummy. A bit pricey though. I see a lot of locals in the restaurant, must be good.
5
Service great, food awesome and prices were very reasonable. Popular place so book or be prepared to wait. The chicken rice was one of the best we had so a definite when you visit.
2
I have had better Hainan Chicken, local people tells me they dont use fresh chicken, and there is no taste of chicken at all, its not worth the price.
4
My second time here and I can't have enough! Food is really delicious and worth waiting and so be prepared to as it is very popular amongst the locals. You're having the Chicken Rice if you are here. Many other dishes are also noteworthy but their names escape me. Fried meat rolls, a spinach in broth with salted eggs to name a couple. I can't wait for the next time
4
We had a family gathering recently, and my relative went to packed food for the He bought lots of food from Boon Tong Kee:- Whole White Boiled Chicken: The chicken were chopped up into good sized chunks and the chicken was more than enough for our group of 9 pax. Chicken was succulent and even the breast meat was tender. It came with sliced of cucumber, which I came to realised were Japanese long (slim cucumbers), not the kind you get at most chicken rice stalls. A good surprise and it was crunchy and nice. The chicken was dressed with their chicken rice soy sauce seasoning and came with chilli sauce and dark soya sauce. The chilli sauce was spicy and piquant.- Golden Tofu: 3cm x 3cm pieces of tofu coated with batter and deep fried. The batter reminds me of the batter of ‘Agedashi tofu’. It comes with a mildly tangy mayonnaise sauce which pairs well with the tofu. Nice!- Braised Pork Belly with ‘Mei Cai’ (Preserved vegetables): There was about 3 pieces of 0.4cm thick sliced of braised pork belly sitting atop a palm-sized amount of braised preserved vegetables. The pork belly was a little dry, but the preserved vegetables portion were generous and it was tasty. - Stir Fried Kang Kong with Cuttlefish in Sambal Sauce: Kang Kong is water spinach and it has a hollow stem. The kang kong plant is plucked into 6cm size and then stir fried with cut pieces of cuttlefish and sambal (shrimp paste chilli). Its not bad. - Spinach with 3 eggs: Chinese Spinach cooked with chicken egg, salted duck eggs and century eggs in a broth. Easy to eat and the soup was also nice to drink.- Chicken Rice: The rice was bought on its own, so we could help ourselves. The rice is fragrant and was ‘individually-separated’ and didn’t lump together. Its good.Overall, it was a good meal, where the chicken and rice hits the mark. This is a place where I would come whenever I need good chicken rice and I would bring overseas guest to sample chicken rice that’s good.Highly recommended

Was running errands among the scores of lighting and bathroom shops here and dropped by lunch. Been here a couple of times before. Service was fast and somewhat cheery. Ordered the standard steamed chicken with rice, plus pan fried egg with prawns. the chicken rice was ok and met normal expectations. The prawns were suprisingly large. At about $18 per person , it was ok valu
3
The place was recommended by our local driver, we went there for dinner and we just waited for 5 minutes before we got the seats.The oily rice was very good but the chicken was average when we compared with the salted chicken with Malaysia, the texture was too soft as the chicken was kept in cages and lost the special chicken flavour
2
We visited this place on last minute arrangement during lunar new year period.Like most chinese restaurants, crowded as usual during lunar new year. So unless you make reservation in advance, otherwise like us queue at least 30mins.The Lohei is pretty good but the service staff is not well trained to present the dishes with the wishes together. For who are familiar with Lohei, you know that there are meaning of th type of vegetables, fish sliced and sauce placed into the dish.As its kind of mass production, so avoid going to such restaurant during peak period ie festively periods or PH.There is no doubt on the taste of the chicken dish, but the rest are really just average.Compare it's food and price, I will prefer Soup Restaurant over it. In terms of price. Both are close at par, but food wise, I will stil prefer the other
5
Forget what you read on the internet or see on YouTube about the best place for Chicken Rice in Singapore. Always ask the locals for their favorite and the same name will pop up more often than not - Boon Tong Kee! The chicken rice here is one of the best in town - the chicken is so tender, succulent, fragrant and tasty. But the best part of all is the rice. Yes, the rice! That is a meal by itself. Don't bother to ask them for the secret ingredient. They'll probably give you that "If I tell you, I'll have to kill you" routine. Go try it for yourself. Definitely worth it. It's very very good. The locals think so too
4
This place was recommended by our taxi driver (arent all the best recommendations by taxi drivers.) asthe best chicken rice in Singapore. It did not disappoint. We had take away twice. The first time was fabulous and we could not fault it. Tasty rice, juicy tasty succulent chicken, a freshing side of pickled veg and a meat ball. The second time we went the rice disappointed - the texture was as if it was undercooked or not enough water. But the flavor was still good and the rest (chicken etc) was good. For SG $4.50 per serve it is not only the best chicken rice but the best value also. There is a great food hall next door "Balestier food court
5
There were 4 of us in Jan 2015. We went there because we saw the queues as we passed by taxi. It is worth the wait.We ordered mainly the courses they highlighted by a full page picture on the menu including the deep fried prawn, claypot rice with chicken & slated fish and fried bean curd which were silky. The presentation was superband the prawns were the best we had throughout our wks in singapore, vietnam and cambodia.Two other issues to be aware of is the service charge of 10% and GST 7% and the pre-laid appetizers on the table are also charged. The final cost was SGD104.50
4
If your looking for excellent chicken and rice... don't miss this place.. its so good it will keep you coming back.. service is fast and friendly and the cost will not break your budget.. i'll be back from more on my next trip in
4
I tried many chicken rice before and definitely this one I consider as the best. 4.5 sgd for 1 portion chicken rice with veggie and generous portion of a melted in your mouth chicken. I am in chicken rice heaven.
5
One of the best Chicken Rice I've had in Singapore. The special ribs,and spinach were awesome to say the least. Beer was COLD which is a good indication of the "heart" a restaurant has for what they serve.
4
We had the chicken rice, spinach with 3 kinds of eggs, fried tofu and hot sour soup. Loved the spinach and fried tofu. Veggies were fresh and the tofu was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Overall a good meal.
4
We ordered half boiled chicken which is the significant dish here. U gotta try it, the best chicken rice i've ever had so far.And one spicy stir-fried veggies, sweet and sour pork, and century eggs. The bill was about S$60 but it worths every cents. Great experience
4
I was on my business trip in Singapore and my colleague bought me this chicken rice. I know for a long time that Singapore is famous for their chicken rice, but this one tastes so good. The price is cheap as well :) I also recommend this to my friends who often go to travel to Singapore as well
5
Came here around midnight to soothe a budding cold. Their fish maw soup was heaven-sent and the signature boiled chicken and chicken rice were just great. Love how they are open until 430am. No queues when we ate there, but the ground level was still nearly full with a good sort of crowd (families, travelers catching red eye flights). Service was very fast and surprisingly friendly. Can't wait to eat there again
4
Boon Tong Kee is, and always has been my favorite place for a good chicken rice meal, because of the excellent service, good variety of food, quality of food and comfortable ambience. Hence, when *Faye and the hubby were in town, this was the place to bring them for some local delicacy.Then each had a bowl of fragrant Chicken Rice (SGD$0.80 each), with their signature Soft-boiled Chicken (SGD$15.00). The chicken was well-oiled but not greasy; it was succulent and juicy in its freshness. The pairing with fragrant ginger-garlic infused rice was good comfort food but not in-your-face impressive (could it be because this is Cantonese style instead of Hainanese style?), but nonetheless it was delicious enough we finished every single grain.Next, we had the Spinach with Assorted Egg (SGD$10.00) dish for some balance. The spinach was cooked soft and tender, the gravy well-flavored with 3 types of eggs - chicken egg, century egg and salted egg.Last but not least, we had the mandatory Crispy Fried Beancurd (SGD$6.00) with a gorgeous golden outlook, a very crispy exterior and melt-in-your-mouth interior, like molasses literally. The palate loves it - imagine biting into something that literally crumbles and melts in your mouth in a heap of deliciousness; the sensation was simply amazing.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/12/lunch-at-boon-tong-kee-chicken-rice.htm

Chicken rice is a very popular local delicacy, you can get it from almost every coffee shop or foodcourt all over the island. But the best one of them all must really be Boon Tong Kee. Tourists like Singapore's chicken rice, the locals like Boon Tong Kee
4
I visited this place recently when my property agent helping me look at houses insisted that I try this place out. Like every popular place, this place had large groups dining in droves. They are known for their Chicken Rice (rice cooked in Chicken broth and garnished with shredded chicken).And they are VERY GOOD at it! Even for a person having local Singaporean flavour for the first time would love it!And reasonably priced too. A meal for 2 with non-alcoholic beverages would cost you ~SGD 30
3
Reservation not need if you do not mind waiting, which can take about 15 minutes. The famous chicken, well, that is. Quite standard.
Try the clay pot liver. It's seriously excellent.
5
Me and my family are falling in love with most of the recommended food from this restaurant: Singapore Chicken Rice, Fried Prawn, Tofu, even their boiled peanuts.... the rice is self is bloody nice and smells good.
4
We order chicken, spinach with 3 types of egg and claypot rice with chicken,sausage and salted fish. The chicken is soft and tender but cpuld be better if its hot. Spinach is the best among the 3 dishes. Need to wait around 15 mins for the claypot. Smell very nice but not salty enough
4
Boon tong kee has alot of outlets in singapore and balestier is my fav outlet. It is best known for it's chicken rice. The meat is very tender, juicy, fresh. And the meat is done very well as there are no more chicken blood in the meat. Note that it is better to order their fragrance rice instead of porridge for better combination with the meat as the porridge is quite bland. They have also quite a number of side dishes which is very nice too which I recommend the Spinach with trio egg. I have also met a Japanese tourist once, that he told me he specially flew over to eat their chicken rice!!! Wow
5
Had the world famous chicken rice at the suggestion of some colleagues who frequent the place and it did not disappoint. Just a tip to anyone heading there, they don't accept credit cards if the bill is under 20$ so be sure to have some cash on you just in case.
3
Actually, they don't serve the best hainanese or white chicken. But the rice was good and tasty that compliment well with the chicken. I don't recommend the Lotus soup. I don't remember the taste of shrimp and the vegetable we ordered. I love the fried pork cutlets, scallops and the calamansi juice. The server was not smiling. We were not allowed to sit anywhere, she designated to us a table for 10 but we were 11 pax. When one of my companion ask for extra glass, she shouted that the table was just for 10. We just took her attitude lightly.
5
They are famous for the Hainan Chicken rice, but my Singaporean host ordered crispy prawn, Chinese bbq pork, a vegetable dish. Everything was excellent. We enjoyed he small plates of appetizers (boiled peanuts and pickled vegetables) that they provided with your order. For drinks, we ordered water chestnut tea, it is slightly sweet, very refreshing
5
This is a local restaurant with a few locations. The patrons are most local. Chicken rice is a local Singapore specialty and this restaurant is known for it. We found out after our first visit that we could order it with no bones which made it easier to eat. This restaurant is walking distance from the Ramada Singapore Hotel at Zhongshan Park.
4
We were recommended to try the chicken rice at Boon Tong Kee by 3 separate taxi drivers, so we gave it a try. Our waitress was a little pushy and tried to sell us the duck and I had to insist that we just wanted the chicken rice! Anyway it arrived and we were very happy, washing the tasty steamed chicken down with a fresh coconut juice
4
This is the famous chicken rice place in Singapore and surprisingly the main branch is located near Days Hotel at Zhongshan Park where I stayed. They open until 5:00am, and you can still find long queue at night. :P Price for chicken rice around SGD10.00 incl. VAT
4
Chicken rice is good but I prefer Kang Kong stir fried.
The restaurant is open at 10 am till midnight.
4
Still not accustomed to eating cold chicken but it was very moist, the rice was very fragrant. Very easy to hail a taxi from the street as it was pretty busy.
4
Had a great chicken rice but had to wait for a table . worthwhile waiting was just good as usual.Service is still not great otherwise would be 5 star rating.
4
The chicken rice (white non roasted) is absolutey recommended. Its their specialty. Chicken is exceptionally smooth and tender. MUST TRY.
4
This is my favourite Chicken rice shop in Singapore.. Always a long queue to get a table.
Fast service and many choices of the food. Their Crispy skin tofu is recommended as well.
4
Order at least half a chicken to enjoy the full flavour, other lesser portions not very well presented and will affect your appetite. Dip the chick into the chilli sauce with dark soy sauce and your can finish a few bowls of rice, must admit the rice itself is not the best but the chick is nicely cooked and shiok. Also recommend the 'Hor fun' and claypot rice available during dinner time, coupled with double-boiled soup, nothing much more you can ask for.... reasonably priced for a restaurant set-up, opens till 4am everyday but i aways try to avoid weekends.can be excellent if the improve their service further
2
After having read heaps of praises onto this establishment we decided to try it out on a short visit to Singapore. Service was quick enough but that was not the prime intention. The chicken (steamed) was overcooked, the meat being dry, non succulent. The rice, which is supposed to be the star, is of poor quality grain, tasted more like broken grains, and had a hint of butter instead of the ginger, garlic, pandan flavoured type. The chilli sauce, again a requirement of chicken rice, is gummy, just like that poured from a bottle instead of the limey tangy chilli sauce that is so part of the chicken rice set. Not impressed
4
This place has always been one of my favorite for nasi ayam (chicken rice). The service is awesome and pakcik (uncle) who usually serves us always throw great jokes. Fish, pork, and veggies dishes are great. To think of it makes me drool. I'll be back Singapore. I'll be back
5
I used to think chicken rice tasted quite ordinary, until a friend brought me to Boon Tong Kee. Just amazing amazing chicken rice. The taste & tenderness of the chicken, along with the rich taste of the rice itself, just incredible.Other food were also great; this may sound strange but I had the best broccoli I've ever had here.The roasted duck strangely tasted too salty and pales in comparison to chicken rice
2
We got the sweet & sour fish which was good & tasty. I didn't like the spareribs we got - too sweet for my taste. I've always thought that spareribs should be salty or spicy to bring out its natural flavor. They failed in this dish. The hakao tasted alright. Mr. Choi's hakao's are way, way better. Boon Tong Kee's serving's are too small (but they said that each dish is good for 2-3 - did they mean 2-3 children or 2-3 adults? ) & the service takes too long. We've had to follow up our orders & requests 3x. Though they redeemed themselves with the coffee almond jelly which they served up for 2 of our birthday celebrants for free

The chicken rice at Boon Tong Kee is so tasty that I do not need the sauce. Kailan with oyster sauce is another dish I highly recommend.
3
We struggled to get the attention of the staff the whole time. The food was nice but a bit expensive. Wouldn't bother recommending this place to anyone
3
Worth it to try only for Hainan chicken rice and deep fried tofu but pricey. This restaurant is located near great world city.
3
I found the food okay but not spectacular (we ordered the chicken rice and hor fun) but there are a few issues . It is crowded and sometimes due to the crowds, the waiters are slow to respond. Also, it is not near the MRT. Plus, we found it hard to get a taxi after eating. There doesn't seem to be any allowance for large groups so our group had to split into separate tables. The plus point is that it is a place to find a meal at 3am in the morning
4
Well at 3am you want chicken rice la , you go to Boon Tong Kee - no frills , no fuss just good food - just good ole food in belly and keeps you happy - this outlet to me at 3am was really nice and friendly

a good friend had a S$10 boon tong kee voucher to use & invited us for a 3pax lunch at the balestier branch. this a restaurant with 31 years history. :-) the stall at chinatown was started by a thian boon hua in 1979. and the very first btk restaurant opened at balestier road in 1983. my friend wanted to book btk at 1pm (as we were all watching world cup soccer opener brazil vs croatia) but it was fully booked. we decided to go early instead at 11.45am, also there were limited kampong chicken so better to be early. there is a huge carpark just behind balestier food centre which is adjacent to btk.we got ourselves a table. the place was full & a queue soon formed outside. about 3 tables were reserved for tourist busload!my friend ordered 4 dishes.#1 kampong chicken was very good, though my friend the connoisseur felt it was not as good as usual. for me it was very good, smooth, sweet & not so fatty. chopstickchopstick& the rice was very good, flavourful & not too oily. the thinly chopped ginger oil dip was excellent! #2 the chicken liver & gizzard were ok. i am partial though to chicken intestine which was not offered at this btk branch.#3 the bean curd with jing bai (津白) chinese cabbage was very good too, especially the beam curd!#4 the hk steamed cod fish with wood fungus (木耳) was excellent, the best. chopstickchopstickthe meal came to S$84 for 3pax including 3 barley drink (S$2.20 each) before using the S$10 voucher. it was not cheap but it was really a very good meal for me.btk is more like a zi char than just a chicken rice stall. i don’t take so much chicken rice these days but this was really good relative to many good neighbourhood chicken rice stalls like the ones i had at tanglin halt & 6th avenue. i will certainly come back both for the chicken rice & also the zi char dishes.

They have very good chicken rice but honestly i have to give it up to Wee Nam Kee for a better chicken. BUT, what is amazing the crispy tofu. It's just a simple deep fried tofu served with mayo dip, but it tastes really good together and find myself craving for it again the day after I ate it. Would totally go back to Boon Tong Kee when in Singapore - good food, nice staffs, nice place
5
Very crowded restaurant during weekday lunch. Have to wait about 20mins to get table. Staff are attentive. Tried their most famous chicken rice, along with kangkung belacan, pork ribs, deep fried tofu, and steamed fish. All were nice although very pricey. I have tried other chicken rice : wee nam kee, tian tian maxwell ; in my opinion Boon Tong Kee is better than those two. But everyone have different taste so let other people judge on their own
4
Clean and comfortable restaurant which is air-conditioned so diners can focus on enjoying a meal without being distracted by traffic noise or the notorious humidity of Singapore.I ordered one whole boiled chicken with rice, deep fried tofu and char siew (sweet roast pork).All in all it was a great meal. The rice was of average quality but very tasty. Good quality succulent chicken and the roast pork was divine with very good caramelization of the sugars used for the sauce.Will definitely visit again
5
I went there for the first time and i have to say it was one of the best chicken rice i have ever had. I was there during lunch time but didn't have to wait long at all. The food was excellent and the service was super.
4
Amazing chicken rice!! Everything else we tried was ok, but the chicken rice is amazingly good. Good value for money. We had a short wait before being seated, but it was worth the wait.
4
Went there at around 8:30 pm - a not so crowded time - as it was just 5 min from hotel. Got a table in 5 min. Food was good as usual but of course a bit more expensive than average.
4
It's just few step away from the hotel, if you don't want to walk far just eat this local food, nice chicken rice although you have to queue a bit while but worth
4
Great atmosphere, tasty food, excellent service! I ate less than the required $20 minimum for visa card, but they graciously let me use it anyway. The chicken was tender and juicy and the fried bean shoots were delicious!
5
This place is great for introducing non-Asian eaters to the culinary delights of Singapore. There is enough 'quasi chinese' food (sweet and sour pork) to calm down any qualms and there is enough Singapore specialties (chicken rice!!) to tempt the taste buds. The service is excellent with our waiter laughing and joking with our two teenage boys and gently coaxing them to try new things. We all agreed that this meal was one of our Singapore stop over hightlight
4
My boyfriend who hails from UK thinks that this is the best chicken rice he ever had in Singapore. The steamed chicken was flavoursome and the chili is spicy enough to taste the fragrant rice at each bite ( it is not for faint hearted though). Sambal kang Kong is delicious too - a must side dish.Overall, it is recommended if you want proper chicken rice and dont mind spending more
3
Boon Tong Kee; been told this is the premier place for traditional chicken rice. We arrived there at 1900h (30/12/13) and there was a decent queue, for a table of three it was 30 mins wait. When our number was called 98 we got ushered in to a table, the waiter bought out some boil peanuts and then that was all the service we got. After 15 mins we waived a waiter and proceed with our order. Average dish was $14SGD. The size was rather small and the taste was so so. We ordered 6 bowls of rice, Chinese tea for 3, a clay pot, two served of soya chicken, a served of honey fried pork all of this come to $88.40SGD.If you expect service from this place, I don't think you get it. The waiter was too busy arguing among them-self and the one at the door was too busy on his Galaxy to notice any customer. We have to call them for extra rices, tea and even for the bill.Overall I think the food is good but over priced. I would not recommend this place
4
We ate here on weekend and the waiting was reasonable. Not cheap I tell you, around SGD 25 per person, but well worth it with aircon, good service, clean place. Try the grilled chicken one. The veggies dishes are very good also but a bit overprice
2
Service staff not friendly just gave a curt nod to acknowledge one's existence. When paying the staff did not speak but instead point to the cash register which showed the amount due. Food prices for takeaway are pricey $6.40 for drumstick rice but rice portion is little and chicken very cold. There are many other chicken rice stalls/restaurants that serve better food and service
4
the food is very delicious, and surprisingly inexpensive for a very popular restaurant.we were lucky to get seated before it was crowded, but the line after us is overwhelming.the only bad thing is that their employees are not at all fluent in english, while we dont speak chinese, so the lost in translation is making us harder to order the dishes we wanted
5
This is the place to go to. Fancy, air conditioned but great service and food. Not the cheapest chicken rice around though. Stay focused on its chicken rice. The other dishes are only ok
4
I visited them for lunch and I csn easily say it wad one of the best chicken rice I had.Be prepared to wait a table.I will recommend this place to all those craving for a good chicken rice.
4
a friend suggested this place when i was in singapore, had good chicken rice which was all that i was eating in singapore.
other dishes were also very good for the price, really help knowing someone that frequented the place.
5
The restaurant dÃ©cor is plain, but the place looks clean. The neighborhood is nothing special. But I would definitely come back to this place, versus the Chatterbox, next time I'm looking for Hainan Chicken Rice. Every dish we had was flavorful, fresh, well prepared. And the price was very reasonable
3
We went there for the famous Hainanese chicken rice, a bit disappointed, first is they do not remove the bone, second is the chicken has no taste, different from what we had tried a few years back. They now serve other food other than chicken, there are several kinds of chicken too. The place is full of people, not too comfortable, but the staff is very efficient and friendly, price of the food is reasonable
3
This isnthe place to go to for authentic hainanese chicken. Place is jampacked, which is proof enough of the quality of food served there. I espacially liked their fried tofu, so juicy and soft. Our group ordered a bunch of other dishes like steamed fish, glazed pork strips, other vegetable dishes, but I was sold on just thr hainanese chicken and the fried tofu already
5
Ordered a $10 portion but sent us a $15 portion. It's half a chicken. The meat was very tender and juicy. But too much for 2 (coz' you got to have it with chicken rice)!!Also ordered sweet n sour pork. The sauce was nice. Pork was juicy and crispy!Bit expensive with tax n service charge though
5
We were taken here for lunch by relatives as they are know for their prized steamed chicken. We were definitely not disappointed as the meal was very tasty. They also sell some of their various sauces used to cook many of their dishes for a nominal fee
5
Very lucky the taxi driver that drive me from airport told me about this place.Amazing chicken rice!also had prawn cake that was great as well.Had to wait 15' as it was very busy - although Thursday night.Will visit again and recommend for sure
4
It's my second time to Singapore, and I still want to go to Boon Tong Kee for dinner, big fan of Chicken rice(not the chicken itself, but the rice!) it's great, every time i'd like to try something new. Last time I had Bak Kut Teh, not bad. This time we ordered pork ribs with yam ring, it's wonderful. like sweet and sour flavour but better, and I love yam! Crispy golden look, but smooth inside, yum! Compare other chicken rice place, it's a bit pricey, but worth a try, also order their home made water chestnut drink, good friend with nice dishe
4
A good place to have your chicken rice fix :-) Their different dishes are good too. Prices are not cheap though.
5
I go to boon tong kee so much so that I know their menu by heart. Chicken is fantastic, tofu, veggie with century egg, technically everything is great for my taste.
4
Great food...great price.. it's there to serve people with food and does it well... one of many famous chicken and rice places on Balestier Road !
If you're there..stop and have a bite
5
try the chicken and rise! you may need to wait to get a table but it is worth the wait. good food and good prices. very popular place.
5
Order the Tasty Imperial Chicken when it's available, the waitress will gladly inform you and suggest it, even if you just came there to order the Signature Boiled Chicken. You won't be sorry. We got there ten minutes before their opening time on a Sunday, to beat the crowds, and had the best chicken ever
3
As a local, who have had Boon Tong Kee and Loy Kee chicken rice while still as a streetside coffee shop decades ago, I sorely missed the original taste and food quality of the old days.Among other dishes, we ordered a half chicken, that was missing the chicken wing and drumstick........and the disappointment on us upon tasting the chicken. Just as the city and its multitude of coffee shops has evolved, the Boon Tong Kee today sells many more dishes then just its signature dish - chicken rice. Other than its namesake and signature dish, everything else is like stepping into a localized version of a fusion chinese restaurant. The place is now supposedly chic, with queue numbers being given due to long queues. An on-the-table electronic button system for "service", "drink" and "bill" and a large screen showing the table who has pressed the button. Unfortunately, when we tried pressing for "Service", our table number 53 became '35' on the screen, and no one attended to us, until we literally pulled a passing waitress. This was done twice with the same results! In my opinion, the coffee shop Loy Kee Chicken rice just diagonally opposite would taste better. However, I reviewed it as "Average", as the generations who have tasted the Boon Tong Kee after it has changed would have felt the taste and food quality is very good. It is only for those of us who have had the original version while it was still in a coffee shop, can relate to what I meant about the "original taste"
3
Many people said the chicken rice here was sensational, among the best in Singapore. I disagree. The food here, for me, was just average. The chicken rice was bland and lacked the wow factor associated with some of the smaller places on the same road. Other dishes were okay but not memorable. Two weeks after the meal and I cannot remember anything else but the average chicken rice. That says it all.The service was okay and efficient. The tables were just too close together in my opinion, and could get pretty uncomfortable for large groups like ours. The location on Balestier Road was convenient but no parking nearby, of course. Getting there by taxi or public transport is recommended
5
I go to this place every month and I always enjoy it a lot. I also use it to bring guests here as I think it offers a true local experience, and they are always very happy to visit. The staff is friendly and makes lot's of fun, and the dishes are always great
3
I rated average is because you still can get decent chicken rice ...it started as a chicken rice stall and grown into something else ...price can be very expensive if you are not CAREFULL ...this place now serve other dishes which to me ...well it gone expensive and it's no longer the place I use to love ...can I re rate it the POOR
5
I went with some friends who lived near by. The place may look ordinary but believe me the food is sensational, the lady who runs is place obviously cares deeply about the quality of her restaurant and experience provide to her guests. I cannot recommend the place highly enough, love it
5
The rice that comes with the chicken rice is the best that we've experiences in Singapore. The roasted or boiled chicken (and everything else for that matter) is excellent as well.
4
The chicken is overrated, so plain and the meat is like just defrost from the fridge. The rice is delicious and what surprise me is the soup of the day.
4
it may be overpriced but no-regret place to eat. personally i prefer BTK, rather than another famous chicken rice shop on the same street. signature white chicken is tender & juicy, comes with superb chicken rice. other dishes such as famous fried tofu or veggie are also tasty. my only negative comment is no chicken soup accompanied with chicken. this visit, i was impressed that 'soup of the day' was served with a big cray pot at SGD6. Jared ginger chilli sauce may be a nice souvenir for yourself or friends at SDG3.5/jar
4
If you're looking for some casual chinese food with moderate pricing, this is the place i recommend to you.. The restaurant is most of the time crowded, so its better to come earlier. Very popular among the locals, staffs are quite friendly and it doesnt take long for the food to come ou
4
Frankly speaking i prefer Boon Tong Kee than another famous chicken rice ..there are several reason why i prefer Boon Tong Kee ,firstly, because their Chicken Rice tastes super good, and they are open till midnight .secondly,from the plate, spoon, fork and their attributes i can see they are very clean and i am so glad they are. you can even see the difference from another i usually order half chicken for 4 person, vegetable, and their fried tofu. i suggest to copy what i ordered !BOON TONG KEE SUPERBBB 
4
On our recent visit to Singapore, we mostly ate at hawker/food centres but gave this restaurant a try due to the good reviews - which were spot on.The food here is great - although more expensive than the centres. We ordered their chicken rice, which was tasty but we've had better and a few other dishes. The highlight of our meal was the braised pork belly buns. You receive a basket of buns and a plate of braised pork belly and build them yourself. The pork was soft and succulent and the sauce was sticky and perfectly balanced with the sweetness of the bun. I recommend trying this dish
4
We had our fair share of chicken rice shops. After trying Boon Tong Kee (BTK), it is definitely in our top 3 chicken rice restaurants in Singapore. We had the steam chicken, it was adequately cooked and the taste was just right. We did not have soup which comes complimentary in other restaurants but in BTK, maybe they expect us to order the specially boiled soup in the menu. We skipped the complimentary boiled beans.All in all, we enjoyed lunch. Worth the ride over to BTK for the real chicken rice
4
The food was above average and is considered one of the better tasting Chinese Restaurants I have tasted in Singapore. My friend and I ordered a set of chicken rice, a claypot toufoo and a deep fried prawn with breadcrumbs. Out of all the dishes, the claypot toufoo is the most disappointing - bland and tasteless. The chicken rice is awesome, especially the rice! OK sounds weird, but the rice is really fragrant and well prepared.Definitely worth a visit if you are craving for good chicken ric
5
The food was incredible, and the restaurant was very clean. I really enjoyed my local experience eating chicken rice with the chile sauce. I went with a local who ordered for me, but the line was out of the door on a Sunday evening, so I'm sure everything is very tasty
3
i was there with my mom to treat her so called one of the best chicken rice iin singapore. The price is expensive. Taste is not bad. To my experience, the taste is as same as tian tian chicken rice. To my disappointment, thereis no chicken soup serving at all which is very important to me to finish my meal.
5
Smooth and tender would be the best way to describe Boon Tong Kee's chicken. The rice fragrant and not lumpy (A common problem with some other chicker rice sellers).
4
Ate at the East Coast Road outlet. Had monster prawns, spicy pork/aubergine, deep fried chicken - was very tasty. As with most restaurants in Singapore we were charged for the appetizer and wet towels.
4
This is the place that many people will tell you is the best Chicken Rice in Singapore. I agree. It has good rice, and great chicken. Even so, you should not stop your hunt for a good Singaporean chicken rice here...
4
uually do take aways as the place is way too crowded in East Coast and Balestiar outlets. Nice chicken with rice and equally tasty chilli.
4
As I was staying down the street, this restaurant was recommended to me. It was an easy walk and we got in quickly although our timing was great because there was soon a queue. Their famous dish is chicken rice but they only sold it by 1/2 or whole chicken so we ordered other things. All our dishes were excellent, particularly the Yam Basket with Seafood. The prawns were big, fresh and very tasty! The service is attentive, the restaurant clean, but very busy. Not a restful place but I will return with at least one more person and try the chicken rice
3
I am a regular Singapore visitor due to my work. I have always been a fan of Hainanese chicken rice, so I was referred by a local to one of the 'originals' of this dish.The restaurant interior was nicely done, clean, and service from mostly Filipino staff were great. I ordered the roasted Hainanese chicken and chicken rice. They recommended sauteed tofu with vegetables and I gave it a try too.The chicken was very tasty, juicy, and they maintained the crunchiness of the skin. It always amazes me how they cook the chicken perfectly and keep the meat moist. The rice was fragrant, but not as soft as I want it to be. The tofu dish was dissapointing, it tasted like its about to go bad in few more minutes. I recommend to stick with Chicken and rice, and maybe their meatball soup which other tables were ordering.If not for the good tasting chicken, I'd say to pay $20/pax for a chicken meal was pricey. But I guess being one of the 'originals' in Singapore's chicken rice craze do has it's priviledges... to charge you more 'lah
4
Went to Boon Tong Kee near Boon Keng MRT based on the reputation that it has as having excellent chicken rice.There were three of us and we ordered: ½ Chicken, 3 Chicken Rice Bowls, Fried Tofu, Coffee Ribs, and a soup.All dishes were excellent, the chicken of the chicken rice was on par with other very good chicken rice places I have been to, but the rice was far better. The rice was soft, moist, and very fragrant. The Fried Tofu seems to be very popular and I can tell why. The tofu itself was good, but the outer fried shell was amazing and when dipped into the white sauce they provide, can be addictive. The coffee pork ribs did not have too many bones and the amount of coffee flavor was just right.We also ordered lime juice but I found this to be too thick and sweet. Service at the door was okay, but in the restaurant the staff was quite pleasant. The restaurant itself has a nice interior
4
Order half a chicken, vegetables, congee and chicken rice. The chicken was tender enough and well cut up.. The vegetables was a little salty. So, you need to ask for less salt. The congee is good though, again, a little salty for my liking. The rice was good.The best part is the black sauce, the hot chillies and the exceptional ginger purée. Very good indeed.
5
When you think about Singapore and chicken rice, Boon Tong Kee is the name that will appear in your mind. This place is an old-time favorite and even though there are some new chicken rice places that people say taste better than Boon Tong Kee, I'd like to be loyal to this dear restaurant. The chicken rice is fragrant and well flavored. It's not mushy or too hard and is not too oily. Next, the chicken is tasty yet the texture is tender. Therefore, A for the chicken rice! Another dish that I like to order is the fried tofu. It goes well with the chicken rice and you eat the tofu with a wasabi mayonaise, yum! Don't worry the wasabi is not too strong and is just nice. Sometimes I also order the kangkung (I think you call it "water spinach" in english). Boon Tong Kee has several branches and it's not a fancy place. So girls, don't come here with your heels and prepare yourself for a comfy meal. Some of the branch don't have ac I think.. Clubbers, there's one in River valley and it's near Zouk. Enjoy the chicken rice after a night of clubbing and the food taste even better :D Another perk is that chicken rice is cheap! Yayy I think one chicken rice is about 4 SGD
3
I don't know why the rice has to be fragrant but to me I can't finish it since there is too much ginger in it and the rice isn't cooked well. If it wasn't for the juicy chicken, the signature dish would be a complete disaster, but the sauce is very ordinary and so is the chili
4
Had a good chicken rice. but little bit expensive had a good taste.
Try near to this hotel. walking just 10 min away.
5
The best Chicken rice i had so far in Singapore. Not only to my expat opinion, but also to the one of many Singaporeans I know. Definitely worth a try!!
4
We went a group of 3 people and all of us took the clay pot rice... it was fantastic! The only reason its not a 5 star is because its a bit pricey...
3
Tourist prices but food is not bad. i just feel you can eat the same local speciality foods at a cheaper price with the same quality.
3
Taste is a bit better than standard chicken rice at hawker. But price is bloody expensive. 2$ for bean. Plus towels and service charge. We just ordered chicken rice for 2 persons. It costed 18$. Which can buy from nice hawker one around 5-7$.
3
tried it some times back, the food are so so only. you can find even better chicken rice somewhere at neighbourhood.
3
The rice was perfectly cooked but the chicken was a bit on the tough side. Too much MSG in the soup which made me very thirsty after the meal. Personally, I thought the chicken rice was overrated.
4
Been many times and always consistent in good food being served. If needing low fat diet dishes just ask for assistance with no skin chicken, steamed rice and vegas...the staff always been helpful
4
When in Singapore, eating chicken rice is a must. Heard of boOn tong kee, so we tried, not the best but it's okay. They also have a lot in their menu. We tried their cereal prawn, pig trotter, ngoyong, vegetable with century egg. It was a nice experience
1
We went there on the strength of advice from Tripadvisor. We ordered the signature dish - chicken rice plus a claypot of venison with ginger and garlic. The venison was obviously treated with a tenderising agent and the taste bore no resemblance to the taste of venison at all. We have eaten venison on numerous occasions in the past. As for the chicken - what a disgrace. The first time it was presented to us we saw that it had remained on the serving counter for 30 minutes before being presented to us. We sent it back as it was cold. The next time again it was presented cold, and, on this occasion it was very pink and clearly undercooked. We sent it back a 2nd time only to have the same dish presented to us again, cold and undercooked. We again, sent it back. Not only this but we were also charged for rice and pickles which we did not request and we did not receive. Big disappointment
3
standards have dropped since the last several years which is disappointing for one of singapore's most famous chicken rice institutions. Service is also rude especially at Balestier, I'm much happier at Wee Nam Kee.
5
My family and I would always visit the branch in Balestier. Loove the bbq pork (char siew). The things are nice and relatively clean.
1
Normal taste but abnormal price.most expensive chicken rice ever.
4
Anytime my guests are satisfied !! Clean food good taste
4
If you ever get tired of eating the Katong laksa, drop by this place. Aside from the chicken, I was blown away by the sambal kangkung and cereal prawns!
1
I went to buy chicken rice for 20pax at 5pm. However, the customer service person told me they are closed, as their cooks and helpers are having their dinner. I was asked to come back at 6pm. No, thank you!!! Cooks and helpers were still working behind the counter, not having dinner. This is not the only joint to get chicken rice from
5
the first thing they serve is the bean. i think u should expect this on every Chinese Singaporean restorant. then chicken rice, and the fish with the bean and the fried union. oh this dish is superb.. i will come here again. then a soup with vege and thousan year old egg.. just beautiful.
5
We were visiting last week the Boon Tong Kee @ East Coast Road and enjoyed the chicken rice as well as other specialties. A real place to go, you get perfect food for fair prices. This outlet is placed in a more traditional area of the city and so you can combine the peranakan experience with good food. At the other side of the road is Peter Wee's Katong Antique House, another place to be. Enjoy this area
3
One of the famous chicken rice in Singapore. I am not a chicken rice fan, but I like their rice more than the chicken. It could be me always ordered the roasted chicken, my colleagues said the white chicken is nicer but just dun really like the white chicke
5
Chicken rice is a "must try" in Singapore. It is one of the staples for locals, and not to be missed for visitors and tourists. Chicken rice is sold in almost every food court and hawker centre but the best can be tasted at Boon Tong Kee. There are many branches and they frequently receive busloads of tourists. However, the quality is not compromised. the chicken is always succulent, the gingered-flavoured rice fragrant and the condiments (black soya sauce, ginger sauce and chilli sauce) mouth-watering
3
only chicken rice stall that has so many franchise and air coned. Chicken rice is a common food, we have it near our neighbourhood.. this is a good place to bring overseas friends to try The famous chicken rice. that's all
4
This is an all time favoruite chichen rice place for Singaporeans and tourists alke. They have a number of branches around the island. You will never go wrong with this choice if you are introducing to your overseas friends chicken rice for the first time.
4
One of then best chicken rice i tasted in Singapore. The place operates 24hour a day and many locals dines here.
1
it used to be very good, but now the chicken is of poor quality, a far cry from before. very disappointing.
4
This place is forever crowded. So service is not great. And be prepared to wait.
Good for late night supper. You can still eat here at 4am!!
5
Chicken rice is a food icon of Singapore. Originally a Hainanese dish, chicken rice can be found at any food court or Hawker centre.Boon Tong Kee is a great place to savor this famous local dish. Located in Balestier, this is just one of their outlets on the island but the most famous. The interior, after a recent makeover, emphasizes the retro look of the sixties.As for the chicken rice, whether you choose 'bai ji' or 'sao ji', the white or roasted skin, the chicken is tender and the rice is very tasty. Eaten with chilli and dark soy sauce, it makes for a sumptuous meal.www.trackpadder.blogspot.co
5
I was told that Singapore has four 'kings of chicken rice' and which one comes first will be your call. but Boon Tong Kee gives you not only the perfect chicken rice which is tender, juicy, but also the rest of everything on the menu! butter prawn, fried rice just to name a few. I could simply stay in this place and eat for 3 days
4
We met our Singaporean friends for dinner there. It's a short taxi ride from our hotel on Orchard Road. The restaurant is famous for its chicken rice and it's packed with local diners and tourists. We ordered the half a chicken and a veg with garlic to go with rice for the three of us. The portion size was generous and the quality of food lives up to the hype that we thoroughly enjoyed our meal
2
My overseas relative was here to visit and suggested that we bring them to have chicken rice for supper. It was already late night. Most of the good stalls are already close. Thus, decided to drive them to Boon Tong Kee as it closes after midnight. We ordered half chicken and vegetables. It was awfully disappointing. The chicken wasn't really tender. Chili tasted like what is sold in other regular store(mass factory made). The last time I ate there(more than 3-5 years ago), it was still not so commercialised and remembered it to be good. Didn't went back there then as I moved house and found a better store at Tiong Bahru. Anyway, the meal was pretty much a disappointment to my family and relatives. They told me that they had way better ones in hk. Had to explain to them that there is better stores, just that they were closed at that time. Felt that BTK is way too overrated and OVERPRICED as well.
4
Boon Tong Kee is the place to be if you're looking to enjoy Singaporean cuisine at an air-conditioned, more sanitized environment. It serves a mean version of chicken rice as well as other favorites the Lion City is known for.There are several branches of Boon Tong Kee but we chose to dine at the original branch in Balestier Road upon the recommendation of locals.The Balestier branch was still full of diners even late at night so we were relegated to the "al fresco" dining area. I didn't mind the on the street eating as it somehow made the experience more authentic.Here are the food we had:Deep Fried Crispy BeancurdI hate anything soy related but miraculously got convinced to try this chicken nugget looking dish. I'm glad I did because it tasted heavenly! Every bite was smooth as silk and I'm sure the touch of mayo helped in making me enjoy the dish.Crispy Cereal PrawnsSweet, spicy, salty, and everything nice. This is one example why I love Singaporean cuisine! The huge prawns were also perfectly cooked.Chicken, Salted Fish, and Chinese Sausage Claypot RiceThey didn't scrimp with the ingredients and it was seasoned well (read: not salty).Signature Boiled ChickenThough not as splendid as I remembered it to be, Boon Tong Kee's chicken still deserves to be considered as one of the best chickens in all of Singapore. Boon Tong Kee certainly didn't disappoint. For pictures on the food, do visit: http://gluttonanonymous.blogspot.com/2011/09/dinner-at-boon-tong-kee.htm

There are so many chicken rice places... some better some worse... but if you are a visitor to town, this chain of chicken rice restaurants are relatively consistent and will offer a good sample of the dish.
4
I would recommend this place for some good Hainanese Chicken. They also serve other dishes, great for the experience....
4
Every combo set they offer promise the experience of enjoying the chicken rice not only with the chicken. We can choose the fried fritter, shrimp or sweet n sour fish fillet and enjoy it with their special chili sauce...slurrp..

Chicken rice alone for dinner can be quite boring. @ BTK, Balestier, you can order delicious side dishes to eat alongside your chic rice. Almost everything on the menu is cooked to perfection. Simply a must for those who are visiting Singapore.

again, highly overrated chicken rice. standard has dropped with the increasing number of chains & too highly priced for hawker centre standard food. Many hawker stalls do better chicken rice these days

My wife and I decided to walk down Balestier Road to find dinner and came across this place. The restaurant offers tables inside with air-con or outside on the pavement, near the roadside. We chose outside and because of the lay of the land, the restaurant sits on a slight hill and sitting in chairs, you do get a bit of a falling sensation as you lean back (or lean forward, depending on which side you're sitting on).As soon as you sit down, the staff put down your cutlery (on table-clothed tables too) and also some char siew pork. It isn't free and is added onto the bill, along with your refresher towel and service tax. One thing you must remember that if you're getting table service in Singapore, then there is almost always GST, service tax and a few other charges on the bill, like peanuts and refresher towels to name a few.We ordered chicken rice with a $10 serving of chicken, which was a generous serving of chicken for 2 people and also a big plate of seafood hor-fun, both which tasted fantastic. We also had a bottle of tiger beer and a coconut drink and the bill came to about $45.The restaurant also had an 'A' grading from the local authorities and with the steady stream of people coming and going during the hour or so we sat there, we knew it was a very popular place the locals loved to dine at. And so did we

Located at River Valley with limited tables. The Chicken was steamed or roasted. If you choose a roasted one- you cannot have a single serve. Half roasted chicken about $ 13.50 . A single serve steam hHainan chicken rice costs $ 5- Rice is extra served in a piramid shape and taste really good.The green bean with scallop with XO sauce was a winner ( $ 20-s ).Limited choice of drink( a barley drink or lemon lime juice ) beer was in the menu. If you are looking for an upgrade from Food court food to an out door eating experience, I recommend the place. I do miss the chicken broth in a bowl traditionally served at other Hainan Chicken Rice establishments

Definately my favorit restaurant in Balestier area. Indeed, chicken rice is a signature dish, the 5 dollar is excellent as a starter to share, dip it in de chili... it's excellent. As a starter, try the grilled pork as well. Usually, I never eat pork, but this is really good! Mains - go for the seafood

I like walking a lot and see the heritage buildings on Maxwell Road, China Town, old town and place near Marina Bay.Recommend to walk and take train. It has a lot of fun and touch real Singaporian culture..Shopping a lot of brand name products. Don't forget to drink nice tea at TWG tea restaurant at the Marina Bay Shopping Mall. Nice and rela

the older folks would tell me it is not the original steamed chicken. but I love the tenderness in the meat and nothing taste raw and no blood would flow out to signify it's not well cooked.The fermented vegetable with braised pork is awesome too. Not too salty
4
I may not agree with what people say even though I find the food acceptable - Unlike some of my friends, I don't necessary crave going there just for the sake of having chicken rice
1
My singapore's friend told me that the foods at this shop taste good. However, I feel it's normal. The famous chicken not as smooth as Lou Wong Ipoh Bean Sprouts Chicken. The most terrible was their service. While I placed order, the waitress show their impolite faces to us, we are thinking want to order more foods for tasting, the waitress told us enough for you all, don't order so much. Is this the matter to treat customers

We ate at the Boom Tong Kee in balastier road for dinner. Chicken rice with 3 dishes for 4 pax. which comes out to be S$70. It is very expensive for chicken rice. The rice is good and fragrant but chicken although tender but dont justify the price they charge. The Bentong chicken rice in PJ Malaysia knocks it totally off the ring.Service is swift but dont see why anyone should queue for this. Can give it a miss and the chicken rice in food court of Takashimaya beats it in a heart beat when you factor in the price
2
We sat outside, along the side street part of the restaurant, next to the kitchen where the dishes were done. Not so nice, but hey, give us a good meal and we don't care. The meal was plain at best. The bill was huge. We regretted having visited the place, and will not repeat the experience. Boon Tong Kee was recommended to us, but I will not pass the recommendation on. It was absolutely not worth the money. I'd rather have some chicken&rice at any of the local food courts and at a tenth of the price.

I have been to both outlets, Balestier and River Valley, and I personally find the River Valley outlet much tastier. Very casual dining - however there is always a queue. Quite a gem for late night dining as well (although past 3am, they have usually shut as a result of running out of chicken). There is just something about their pyramid-shaped rice! Their other token gems are: the deep fried tofu in wasabi mayo sauce and the prawn noodles. These noodles actually rival their chicken rice. Amazing! Must try if you're in Singapore! The prices have increased over the years - but definitely worth it

This restaurant is just 7 - 10 mins walk from where I live.I like to go there once or twice a month.My favorite dishes is hainan boiled chicken with rice (the rice is full of ginger smell and nice taste,chicken is chunky) and imperial pork (tasty pork ribs-very tender).Every time I been there,I always ordered 2 main and some other fried veggy.Tips : they charge for steam nuts for 2 s$ which I did not like the taste...so if you dont like it just sent it back when they try to put it on the table / wet tissue on the table cost 30 cent..little money but since I got charged it took it back home :

Every time i'm in Singapore, I will go to Boon Tong Kee for the Chicken Rice. I always order the Chicken drumstick including the upper thigh. Also my favorite is the Rice Flour Roll, baby kai-lan, and the deep fried tofu.If you feel adventurous, tryt he deep friend chicken feet. Yums

As I consider myself as a foodie, I had to try so famous Chicken Rice and the place I chose was this restaurant. It is not a beautiful place, but the food was exactly an Wow!. Delicious Chicken Rice, Pork Rib and all the delicious meals I ordered were fantastic. The staff at this restaurant was helpful but I would appreciate two more waiters. Very good impression. I dream to be back the next time I am in Singapore.

I have been to two branches, the one in Bukit Timah and the one near Outram Park. The Chicken Rice Recipe is delicious and the chicken is great especially with the soy sauce. The service is good and works at a respectable pace. The Kai Lan with the salted egg white is very nice because the Kai Lan is very soft and goes very well with the century egg as well. The fried tofu is my favorite with the mayonnaise. The recipe is very nice. The hospitality of the staff made us feel right at home. I liked the fact that in the Outram Park outlet they put T.V's on the walls so we can see how they make what they serve. Even though the queues can be very long the food is worth it. Chicken Rice fans i recommend that you visit Boon Tong Kee
3
Dining in cost us $30 for two adults and one child. Ordered chicken portions for three persons and 4 bowls of rice, Kai Lan and Deep fried beancurd. Serving portions significantly smaller than take out. Think it has to do with size of rice bowls. Would have save about $5 if ordered take out.Btw, found hair in rice bowl. Gross. Server was pleasant enough and changed out rice

Try 5 stars chicken rice in Katong and you'll know!
2
From bad to worse...
4
This is my first time to try. Food was good, but the price is little bit expensive. They also charge you on the napkin.
3
Very nice hor fun, good wok hei!
3
Nice but way too expensive for chicken rice
3
good but expensive
3
good chicken rice
4
A coronary waiting to happen but sinfully good nonetheless!
3
This chicken rice chain is very popular with the locals but has never been my favourite.To begin with the chicken is over cooked and too soft. The rice is just too oily and the sauces used lack fragrance. This is a far cry from the original Hainanese chicken rice. Try Yet Con for a taste of true to goodness Hainanese chicken rice and you'll know what I mean
4
I never go the branch at Balestier Road but I frequent the one at Boon Keng MRT almost weekly! (under Block 34 - Exit B of Boon Keng MRT station)SIN$3.50 + 7% tax for simple & good chicken rice - if you take away - you can get away with all the dine in surcharge
3
Really rich chicken rice.. and great garlic prawns
2
nice chicken but rice disappoints.
4
Porridge is really... smooth and tasty. chicken, fish.. good!
3
Chicken rice are served fast. But one thing is the chicken is not fleshy. Perhaps the server pet it too hard on the meat to flatten it. He shouldn't do that. Overall the food is good.
5
Excellent chicken, garlic-chilli, raw fish and deep-fried tofu.
4
Excellent chicken rice!
4
One of the more famous chicken rice stall in SG.
5
"comfort" food. Not just for chicken rice but you can order other dishes from their ala carte menu. Packed on weekends.
4
small bowl of rice with big pieces of chicken
3
OK for its Chicken, Rice, Oyster Sauce vegetable, chilled boneless chicken feet. Will leave a good after taste, which will keep customers returning back to eat again. Car parking is a challenge to me at Balestier though.
3
this seems like one of the better BTK branches with better standards. gd quality chix rice here
3
Should try as it is one of the local food in Singapore.
5
The Chicken Rice is simply delicious! BUT very expensive!

I wish they let us focus on the chicken and stop cross selling. But chicken is quite good
4
One of the best, if not the best, chicken rice in Singapore

4
Best BTK outlet!

overrated
3
Chicken rice is chicken rice. Still like the Serangoon Gardens one
3
Anytime favourite dish...Chicken Rice

Their hor fun is really good. Try also their deep fried beancurb, steam slice fish with "caipoh" and of coz their chicken rice.
4
Definitely the mothership for hainanese chicken rice, but apparently not as good as some others lately.
3
Somehow its part of my childhood memory...

One of my family's favorite. We love the hainan chicken rice and the boiled chicken. Also, we always order the fried tofu with mayo and lemon juice that comes in small jar.

over-rated and expensive

Okay chain dishing chicken rice with strange choice for table top covers.
3
Just order the chicken rice. Everything else is ex. They have take- away set meals for $5.
2
Used to be great. Since the renovation and expansion, it's somewhat sloppy.
4
They have fragrant Rice and nice Mayo Deep Fried Toufu. This is a must to eat in Boon Tong Kee.... Delicious, especially after clubbing~!~
4
Great chicken rice; one of the best I've tried.
4
Rice is fragrant and chicken is tender. Now they have zi char also. A bit to ex though.

Great steamed chicken but quality of other food has gone down somewhat over the years.

Best Local Food - Must Try

When I was in america, i did not miss my parents, or my comfy room in singapore as much a s i missed CHicken Rice, and especially the CHicken Rice and Fried Tofu in Boon Tong Kee..I think the cravings r because they use more coconut milk in their rice than usual which makes it hyper tasty..but then after eating it several times, i felt it was too thick and fattening and switched to FIve Star Hainanese in River Valley Road, which is also very nice but healthie
