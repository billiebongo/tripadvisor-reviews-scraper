We found Whisk by accident after walking around a local food centre looking for a Western style breakfast. Enjoyed the eggs on toast, croissant and yoghurt but most of all, just loved the delicious, professionally made lattes - very welcome after 2 weeks in Asia!

I took a break with cappuchino and croissant. Interior is quite unique and sense but sound was too noisy. So, it was not for reading book. chating with friends will be ok.

We found Whisk by accident when my kids were after some western food after 3 weeks travelling through Asia. Whisk was a great stop. The croissants were flaky and buttery, the coffee and tea were amazing and the shop was well maintained.

Lovely clean cafe with scrumptious cakes and pastries on offer. Coffee was very good and owner friendly and helpful.

I stopped by for a coffee, although they offer various sweet pastries, cakes and lunch/brunch items too.
Coffee was really good and it is a very modern looking cafe with nice and airy feel. Nice place to chill out.

Food is good but I still think food at Kith is better.Service needs improvement. Why? Because there are so many cafes around Tiong Bahru.Order and pay at the Cashier.Service could be better. On first arriving at the cafe, the Cashier not very politely asked the person in front of us to return the menu. His attitude needs improvement.Then we asked for the menu. It took him a good minute or two flipping through some pages to pull out 2 sheets - one for food and one for drinks. Really it should be better organised. Cashier did not ask for return of menu at the time he handed the 2 pages to us. I suppose we are supposed to know that automatically. Definitely not a good first impression.They have some nice 19th Century original Japanese woodblock prints hung on the wall for sale from a nearby gallery called DEGOSART.Served ice lemon tea. Never asked if we wanted the sweetener and never bothered to send it to the table. Grrrr....For some unknown reason, I canâ€™t seem to upload the photos today

Honestly don't really ever care about service unless I'm spending a lot of money somewhere, but our barista was absolute trash. Seemed like he could careless about us ordering or cared about the coffee he was making us. The coffee wasn't bad, don't get me wrong but this was disappointing. I expected more from the aesthetics of the cafe.Note: also, no wifi... come on, Singapore

Been here 4 or 5 times. Pleasant service; Good atmosphere. Clean white fresh feel to the cafe. A lot less frantic, noisy and cramped than Tiong Bahru across the road. Flat white coffee is one of the best I have tried, although a little cool in temperature. Carrot cake was good as wel
5
I have been searching for good buttery, flaky scones. So far, this is the best I have found the scones are good as is the coffee. Even better, the place is not o e of those pretentious "afternoon tea" places where you have to purchase a set of other things.

Whisk is a lovely small cafe owned by Patissier Tricia Lim with a nice white colonial look at the store front with glass panels that gives you a glimpse of the inviting interior. The clean white theme and natural light makes the interior look and feel spacious. Read more about on experience darrenbloggie.co

Trendy cafe in this interesting neighbourhood. Good coffee and delicious gelato with some interesting flavours.

At whisk cafe you can have the best espresso coffee that you can find outside italy... and better than many italian ones.
Cakes and croissant are excellent and staff are super friendly!
Absolutely great

Our saviour for great coffee while in Singapore, and their granola yoghurt was pretty darn good too!

The strategic location helps - a corner store in the middle of Tiong Bahru. Its all white exterior and interior gives an inviting air of comfort. While waiting for a haircut appointment across the street, enjoyed good cappuccino and orange loaf/slice to complement. There weren't too many patrons - which is good for someone looking for peace and quiet. Service from the young crew is friendly and polite.
5
I remember the first time I visited this cafe was last year, and they were short of employees, so the service was good but needs to wait for a while, especially in the peak hours such lunch time. And after the first visit, I keep coming back to this cafe, even it is not located in the city center.Whisk cafe offers a range of dessert and coffee, and my favorite is their carrot cake!!!My suggestion is to enjoy this cafe after lunch time for dessert or early evening for a coffee break.Very clean and neat interior makes you want to stay longer there

After checking out the shops and eateries in the Tiong Bahru markets we did the heritage walk and viewed the Art Deco architeture. We were looking for somewhere cool, comfortable and inviting. We also wanted a simple sandwich and a great coffee and we found all of this at Whisk. Friendly staff and a great place to chill, in more ways than one
4
Decided to try Whisk since the cafe across the road disappointed us. Good chocolate chip cookie and brownie...one of the better brownies I have had in some time now. Decent mocha as per hubby. Tables are a bit too close for comfort and the noise levels get quite bad if the cafe is packed...hope they can do something about that. Will return if we are here again

We came here for breakfast on our second day in Singapore and both ordered the breakfast croissant and cappuccino.The breakfast croissant was nice, but it would of been nicer if it was proper cheese and not the processed burger slice cheese, apart from that it was very tasty & fresh.The coffee was the best we have had in Singapore & to make it even better it was decorated with a bear/panda face!The cafe is decorated beautifully, it has lots of sunlight, very clean and relaxing.I would highly recommend coming here, and make sure to try their Bostock
4
Nice ambience place for chit chat with friends. We were there near 10pm and was told that they closed at 11am. There wasn't many people in the cafe around that time.We ordered, mocha, latte, cappuccino, English breakfast tea, ice chocolate (no hot chocolate) my cheese cake and carrot cake.For drink wise, I think it tasted fine. I like their cheese cake but not the carrot cake as I find it too sweet. They greet us and say good bye to us too. P/s: they have clean and nice toilet!
5
Nice designs on the coffee, with tasty ham cheese croissants for breakfast. The latte coffee had taste, not too milky
4
This cafe has a variety of pastries. I like the brownies with ice cream. The drinks are pretty expensive though. Good place to hang out with friends and family.
4
I had a cup of tea and a croissant for breakfast. I thought the croissant was really good. It was flaky and chewy, which is hard to get. The place is nice and modern. The service was friendly.
3
Came here for a croissant and coffee as I'm still looking for the ultimate croissant in Singapore. Coffee was okay. I ordered my usual mocha and it was fairly pedestrian. The croissant was too crispy and not buttery. I think this is due to Singapore humidity (we ate at Joel Robuchon and if his kitchen can't turn out a great croissant....) Overall, I'm still a fan of the other cafe in Tiong Bahru so won't be back

I stumbled across Whisk last week with my son and brother-in-law on the last day of our holiday in Singapore. I so wished we found Whisk (and Tiong Bahru in general which we loved) earlier in our trip as this was the best coffee shop with the best coffee we found in Singapore. This is the sort of cafe you would make your own, especially on a lazy Sunday morning with a newspaper and one of their great macaroons (the cakes looked fantastic although we only had coffee and macaroons) and a couple of cups of coffee.The young woman who I think owns the shop was also so welcoming and infomative of the area and obviously has a great passion for what she does.I hope this continues to be the success it deserves and I look forward to another visit next time I am in Singapor

Great coffee and bread is OK, but it's really offensive to have crappy processed cheese and ham in a breakfast for 28$Â°All other bakeries in Tiong Bahru serve real cheese, real ham and mostly fresh baked bread. Making these small changes might stop this place from going bankrupt.
4
I love the out of the way places. Go here. Coffees are good the desserts are good. Having the carrot cake is a must. If you're lucky enough to get to talk to the lady owner, I forgot her name, do so. There's a nice little story to this place. Bright, easy to find and easy to stay all afternoon. I'll be going back for sure
4
We visited for a coffee and cake mid morning. The coffee was good, but only warm. The food selection was quite good. The place was over cooled, to be almost cold. The man behind the counter was obviously very tired as when not actually serving, had his head on his arm on the counter. Not a good look for a cafe/ restaurant which is modern and clean. One of th better ones in Tiang Bahru
5
Can't help talking bout the carrot cake n toilet. This is a really great cafe to go for brunch or a light dinner. The carrot cake is soooo delicious, pairing with a bottle of blue berry white tea! You will not feel bored when u visit the toilet as there are mirrors. A great cafe for photography too ^

I visited Whisk last week on my first day in Singapore. Had a wonderful coffee and cheese and ham croissant for breakfast. The young lady who owns the establishment couldn't be more helpful, even spending time suggesting plenty of places for me to see on my first visit to Singapore (I will definitely be back). I cannot recommend this coffee more highly
4
I enjoyed their ham & cheese croissant and coffee deal several times. Coffee was decent, other items seemed a bit pricey, but this is Singapore...
3
The place is cozy & comfortable I should say. Their carrot cake is really a hit👍, not much choices from the cake displays.
Suggestion service to be improve, more choices to be offer (cake counter)

I tried this place with some of my friends, it's small place in the corner , opposite tiong bahru food market, hmm... My opinion : the place is nice, small, cozy , , serving kinda dessert or afternoon tea kinda stuffs , love the CARROT CAKE, i think it's one of the specialty , but overall, nice, but nothing special
5
Whisk is a cozy cafe right in the heart of Tiong Bahru. The staff are nice and you can tell that the owner/chef takes a lot of pride in her work. The atmosphere is warm and inviting so it's a nice place to relax with a cup of coffee, but the star of the show are the desserts. I first tried the cheescake which was amazing... hints of citrus which I quite liked and a smooth, creamy texture. Another time I tried the carrot cake; now I'm not really a carrot cake person, but this was damn good. Not too sweet with a nice, nutty flavor. Will definitely go back to try other pastries :

My husband and I were in Singapore for 4 days and we stopped in every morning for the $9 set: ham&cheese croissant with beverage. The latte art alone is worth the trip, hearts and peacocks and bears-oh my! The owner is the sweetest, seeing us with our map and recommending places to go on our stay. We learned that she studied culinary abroad and you could certainly taste it. We tried new pastries daily: the salted caramel eclairs were superb and the macaroons were better than what we tasted in the Marina Bay Sands hotel. I highly recommend a visit

I love this place! The staff is friendly and the selection is outstanding. The food, by appearance alone, is incredible. Coffees come with designs drawn into the foam, and the pastries look as though they were flown in from France. I love the food in Singapore. But being from America, I find it hard to do shrimp and noodles for breakfast! Whisk offers ham and cheese croissants and a variety of excellent breakfast options that got me going every morning. The owner will also gladly give you advice on where to visit if you are new to the area or are a tourist. This is a great stop..

Away from the busy strip of diners impatiently waiting for a table at Open Door Policy and Forty Hands is Whisk. The cafe is tastefully decorated and has great windows to people watch from. We were told that the pastries are all baked in house and it does taste like it. Between my dining companion and I, we had two scones and an almond croissant. The scones were lovely although the one I had spent a little too long in the microwave when I asked for it to be heated as the centre was dried out. The homemade raspberry jam that you pay $1 extra for is worth it as well. The little biscuit that came with our coffee was delicious. Light and so crisp, we felt sad that there were only one for each of us. Coffee isn't spectacular but acceptable. If you are looking for somewhere you can have a conversation and to just enjoy the weekend, this is it. We'll be back

We ate breakfast at this cafe twice during our week in Singapore and would probably have been eating there every day if we had discovered it earlier. The staff were really really friendly (gave us great tips about things to do in Singapore), the coffee was good and they had delicious almond croissants. If you are staying in Tiong Bahru, this is the place to be

This place has some of the best coffee in Tiong Bahru be closes when most people go to work.As someone who has lived in TB for years its nice to see a new cafe once in a while. But it even closes on a Monday, the day most people need good coffee. Such a shame no wonder overpriced TBB can survive the rental rates.

This little pastry cafe is a must visit if you are in the area. Actually, if you aren't in the area it's worth making the trip and then explore the quaint surrounds. The quality of the food is, quite simply, exquisite. We had orange and cranberry scones, croissants (with a heavenly strawberry jam) and Bostock (a brioche with almond butter). All three were light, full of flavour and delightfully buttery. We WILL be back
