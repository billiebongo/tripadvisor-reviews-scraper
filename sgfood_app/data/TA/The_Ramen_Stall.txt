Good and wide selection of foods, but instead of using tea bags for the green tra, it could've been prepared normally.

Unfortunately the vegetarian options are very few and far in between. Even the vegetable and mushroom ramens used chicken broth. I ended a spinach garlic dish, which was not very satisfying.

Having late dinner(supper) around 11+ found this restaurant online.
Ramen not hot, Curry rice average, Cola wings too sweet.
Only Fish skin & Salmon delicious.
Food are costly 6 dishes cost us $70+.

Lovely food, but the place is always pack. Be sure to make a reservations during the weekends. Tried their Wasabi prawn taste different from the rest. Something different for a sushi lover. HALAL too!!!

Had tried few plates over couple of visits. We really like the food but we believe it is over price. Restaurant is average size and can be slow to serve you the food. Like the scallop.

Bad service for waitstaff. Restaurant opened late when opening time indicated 5pm-6Am. One Staff was not baby friendly. I was wearing hijab and when asked for a spoon to feed my baby a cake, she said no outside allowed. And again she said make sure food is halal. Spoon not given. $10 charged for service charge. First and last time for sure

Was with a Muslim friend so we headed over to try the Japanese food.Many chicken soup based ramen so you will have plenty of choices. Apart from that, they serve seafood as well aside from the usual sushi and ramen so I was quite confused if it was a Jap restaurant or it sells a little of everything. Ordered the dry ramen and it was surprisingly nice. The sauce was good, still gave you eggs and chicken meat just like how you will have it when you order a soup based ramen. Decent pricing too. Will recommend if you have Muslim friends

2 of the many items we ordered were not available but was not inform before hand. The service staff China could not converse in basic English so ended up like chicken and duck talking. The food were also not up to our expectations!!! Overall it sucks!!

We had a car on this day and were around this area. My friend's boy likes mee soup while I am craving for Japanese Food, It is not easy to find a halal Japanese restaurant in Singapore, so why not?My friend ordered some dishes which I have never think of ordering before. Beef Sushi and Cheese Squids and they tasted superiorly delicious. I told my friend not to order Sashimi here because I found the sashimi was thin and expensive. The kids enjoyed their Char Siew Chicken Ramen. We had a fulfilling and enjoyable dinner

So I decided to take a late night foot massage after a long day, on the North Bridge road, which is 30 mts from the hotel I stay in everytime I visit Singapore. Felt a little hungry post my massage and saw just this place open along the entire street at that hour. This place wasn't around when I had previously visited in 2014. So I checked in and realized it was a Japanese restaurant, and I'm not a big fan of Japanese food as I like my food with lots of chillies. But the menu looked interesting and I was hungry too.So I ordered a Beef Ramen bowl with some fried rice. Surprisingly everything was extremely greasy and tasted much like the oily Indianised version of Chinese food that we get here in Mumbai. Whatever happened to the 'Japanese' cuisine!And the food wasn't fresh. It seemed the food was quickly prepared with pre-cooked ingredients. This place is avoidable

It is a nice place to have a fast dinner on a busy day. The food is good and the prices are reasonable.

Service is extremely disappointing. instead of telling us that we are required to wait outside, the staffs scolded us 'bodoh' thinking that we do not understand Malay. After we provided feedback to the manager, we can hear the girl saying 'complain la' instead of being apologetic. We were very interested in trying the food here but because of the bad attitude of the 2 waitresses, the adults just lost our appetite. I really hope the management takes action on how the staffs as I can see there are many bad feedback in the TripAdvisor or company will run out of customers

Always seen a LONG LONG queue every time i past by the stall, just couldn't understand why.So, i make a visit.As the Signage highlighted for this is a RAMEN stall, so i assumed it should be at least good with the Basic RAMEN in Plain soup, but i'm sorry to say.It actually insulting the name for RAMEN, it will make people who never try RAMEN before had a bad impression with RAMEN.Sorry, please change your shop name to Japanese Foods Stalls, don't spoil RAMEN from me. I Love Ramen

Ordered the volcano ramen but it tasted just average although the menu stated that it was their signature ramen. The good thing is you are able to choose the preferred spice level. Serving took quite abit of time too. The side dishes were only served one hour later, when we have all finished our ramen.
4
Visited the place for the second time. Crowd was as usual and had to wait a while before we got a table. Tried the volcano ramen and chose mild for spicy level which I thought was spicy enough. Too much and you would be just tasting Chilli. Ordered some skewers too. Not the best we've tried but it's not too bad.

The place is not big. You need to wait outside the restaurant before they assign you your seat. I've been there twice lunch hour. I don't have to wait long. Food is not great. As it is not easy to get halal Japanese food in Singapore, Muslim still patronise the place. One caution. When you order, please make the waitress/waiter repeat your order. Ask them about your food after 15 minutes. My first experience with the waitress was bad. I've read few reviews on their bad service. I believe the management are working very hard to train their staff. We didn't get our food until we reminded them a few times.Many months later, we went again (we look Japanese food and it is not easy to get halal Japanese food in Singapore.) definitely service has improved the 2nd time we went

I ordered a late night snack to takeaway at past 11pm. However to prepare a couple of plates of sushi and sashimi, they took more than 30 minutes. When I arrived, I still had to wait for 15 minutes. I think the service speed should be worked on
4
Had the level 3 volcano ramen and Hokkaido chicken strips. Food is tasty and portion was sufficient. Most importantly, the price is affordable.Due to a mix up, our food came only 30 mins later which is not awesome considering we were very hungry. However, the staff waived off the service charge and gave an additional discount as service recovery. Guess that's how you retain guests. Will recommend this to those looking for halal eateries

For those who are particular about eating Japanese food, this is a good place to go for Halal Ramen and Halal Sushi. Great service. It could get busy, especially for dinner service on a weekday, if you think you can't wait for your food, best not to go, or to go at a later timing.Opened till the wee hours of the day, convenient for those who would like to catch up for supper or simply just chilling out

10 minutes walk from Masjid Sultan, their website states that the restaurant is opened from 5PM - 6AM on weekdays so do note in case you are hankering for some ramen during lunch. Menu was pretty extensive, my boyfriend and I had the following: Chicken Cha Shu Ramen ($11) We thought that it was pretty alright. The menu did not allow us to choose the done-ness of the noodle. Soup was okay, understood that the base was from chicken bones boiled for 30 hours - but there was no "kick". Maybe it lacked chicken oil. Noodle portion was enough for a small eater, though I felt that they should be more generous with the cha shu chicken seeing that is the main attraction of the chicken. Salmon Sashimi ($9.90) We counted 8 slices and it was laid on ice and served in a box that is shaped like a boat. Very cute ! Sashimi tasted creamy and the slices were not too chunky or thin. Shishamo fish ($2 per piece) I was suprised they had shishamo and had high expectation. Fish wasn't crispy enough - in fact it was slightly soggy and oily. Would not recommend. Drinks - Fruit juice ($3.80 each) We had green apple and watermelon - which was avaerage. Expect to pay more if choose to not have ice. Total damage : $43.50 ($51.15 after 10% service charge and 7% GST) Ambiance & service: Fast service, ambiance was Japanese themed - they had pop music playing the background. We had a table for 2 and it was rather squeezy. Suggestions to The Ramen Stall: - More condiments perhaps mayo on the side? - Batter up your shishamo to have a crispier taste. - Serve you appetizers first before the ramen

Those who crave for ramen in the middle of the night; its the best place to go to. Nice place, pretty good services and also friendly servers. I would definitely go back!!

The only thing I can say about this restaurant. It so Amazing and I love all the food there. Couldn't get enough of the Soft Shell Crab Maki. I recommend this restaurant for those who are looking for halal ramen!
5
A lot was said about this quick service ramen place and I must say its good.
Was back for a couple of days and my wife brought me here. Enjoyed the meal so much that I would definitely come back when I'm in town again.

Had a late work day and caught a quick supper here. Was impressed with the quick service of the staff and the noodles I had - Kimchi chicken noodles and the vegetarian special. I've passed this corner shop many times at North Bridge and its always busy. For a first time, it did satisfy my midnight tummy rumble and the need for comfort food :) well done!

A Halal Japanese Eatery? It is rare for such an establishment in Singapore for the Muslim community. We ordered Ramen, Tempura, Sushi & Scallops. Their Teppanyaki Giant Hokkaido Scallops were fresh, tender & flavourful. The Vegetable Tempura was crunchy and importantly not oily. California Roll was ok. Volcano Ramen was indeed spicy. There was service recovery when they missed out on my special request. Complimentary Yoghurt Soft Serve was served to us at the end of our dinner. Overall pleasant dining experience

We visited as we love Ramen. We had some sushi to start which was delicious , I had the Chicken Cha Sui and my husband had the kimchi chicken, they were both very good, loved the soya eggs, we had fresh carrot juice and melon juice, which oddly the couple sat next to us order which got us chatting, they live in Singapore and recommended another restaurant Zam Zam, review to follow!! I would definitely recommend this place though very good food and service they open at 5pm and close at 5am

Went to ramen stall for the first time, total of 3 pax with one infant in a stroller. I must say this place does not even deserve 1 star from me. And I will tell you why 1) We were waiting outside the stall before another couple but they were given the seat first, YES i understand cause it's just both of them, but your staff should have the courtesy to say " hi ma'am, sorry they're couple so I gave them the seat first, if you don't mind, give us about 5 more minutes and we will get you a seat. But no! WE WERE NOT INFORM TO WAIT OR ETC 2) Upon entering the stall, the manager open the door but did not hold the door for us knowing that we have an infant in the stroller BUT did open and hold the door for another family before us.3) We had a total of 2 staff coming up to us asking if we have taken our order. You guys jolly well hand over the ordering sheet to me outside the stall and none of you all know what is going on?4) One of your staff (chinese girl with short hair with specs) just slam my unagi rice set on my table. Seriously? What is up with that attitude?? SO RUDE!!5) Spoke and informed the manager, mr. teck (if im not mistaken) but all he said was ok, ok. What the hell? I went off and say "wow just ok with no apologies? This is bad! And he just smile Bottom story is this will be the first and the last time I will be coming here. WORST PLACE TO DINE IN!! For a $90 bill which is inclusive of service charge, i get this kinda stuck up service?? Damn the manager and the chinese girl are one arrogant people! And I suggest you guys wear a name tag and go for a proper training with a good customer service and procedure, even the manager too! What a shame

Been seeing rave reviews and decided to check out on Fri eve with my girlfriends. We tried the beef ramen and dry ramen together with some sides dishes including unagi, salmon and hanamaki among other things. Their service was great. Very quick. But I think that's about it. The beef ramen tasted like a lighter version of laksa which was agreed by my other gfs. I was expecting a clear kinda soup base. Maybe it was my fault for assuming. Portions of the ramen was a tad small even though we are not big eaters. The side dishes were alright. Price was on the steep side. Not sure if I would return though. For a first time, it's alright. For returns, I don't think so.

A halal Japanese restaurant. Read some good reviews and decided to give it a try. Was terribly disappointed. Ramen was not flavorful as expected. Ordered Stir-fry Asparagus with Mushrooms and was equally disappointed as the asparagus used were thin and hard to chew. The only consolation was the Deep Fried Chicken and the chili sauce that came with it.During the visit, one of the serving staff spilled a bottle of water near to us and we got some splatters. There was no apologies given and there was no urgency by the waitress to mop up the mess too.There were many serving staff but many were caught up in own affairs. Only a few were attentive to customers.Will be my first and last visit

Never thought there will be Halal Japanese food. To my surprise, the ramen are really good. I am a soup person for ramen, and frankly, the soup base is delicious. A little overpriced, but it's still reasonable. Would introduce it to my friends.
4
We had arrived late and went walking for dinner options. Ramen was open when many others weren't. We were pleasantly surprised. Good quality nice variety. We enjoyed everything we ordered
4
The food tastes good and it is not very salty like those typical Japanese food.The staff is quite friendly and the soft drink are refillable except for fruit juices.
4
The rib is a bit small. Prawn taste good and the scallop is superb. The way they display food looks like fine dining. Soft and tender unagi , big portion for the bento set. Noodles is flavourful. Great location.
3
I've been here 3 times and always order the level 3 volcano ramen which is pretty decent.
Went again today and ordered chicken wings. We got 2 small wings on satay sticks. Tasted like nothing but salt. Goodness.....
4
I visited here at night. The food was delicious.. I really recommend Torched Salmon Sushi and Teppanyaki Giant Hokaido Scallops !!! You will love the food!
4
Great menu with sushi, ramen and more. Affordable prices. Recommended. Nice and clean kitchen area with a direct view for guests. Try the ramen and the toasted beef sushi or scallops.

It wasn't easy to find authentic halal japanese food in singapore so I thought we needed to try this out. Place is crowded during dinner. Taste can be further improve but a little overpriced. Variety of japanese food available. Service can get a little slow at time but it's understandable with all the crowds. But our order got mixed up thrice. Still, their service recovery was great. Would definately come here again, hoping they have improved since my last visit

Ordered a volcano level 3 ramen and as advertised it was spicy. Also ordered prawn with roe and mayonnaise. I did not like it. But it's just my fault that I got nervous when I saw a full sized prawn in from of me. (15 cm

We had lunch here and it was an enjoyable meal. We ordered sushi, sashimi and a variety of other western dishes. Love to eat the yoghurt and chawamushi here. They also have juice and Japanese tea. I ordered the honey dew juice. Also, the Unagi (eel) is very delicious. My colleagues ordered the ramen and you can choose the degree of spiciness. Would recommend this place for those who like to eat in the early hours in the morning. The opening hours for weekends is 12 noon till 6am
