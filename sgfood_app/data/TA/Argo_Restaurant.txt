Small but cozy place for a girl's night out. Price was good with no GST charged and food served was delicious especially the pasta and beer fried fish and chips.

This restaurant has become a favourite spot of mine to have a quiet evening with decent food and beverages at awesome prices!

We will visit again..

We liked that they have a simple local snack counter for the children in us to help ourselves to the traditional biscuits they provided. The menu is concise which is my only grip but for the leisurely ambience, price and quality in the middle of the city, this is a good choice

Very pleasantly surprised at their food quality and how good the food tasted with the prices we were paying. Didn't expect to pay such affordable prices for such great food. The cherry on top was the service was really excellent! Attentive and really polite staff. Great place for family gatherings, romantic dates or just a chill place to hang w friends. Do book in advance for groups as seats are limited

Food: The mains were alright. However, I felt that the beer taste wasn't very prominent in the Beet Battered Fish & Chips. Dessert wise, my boyfriend and I felt that the coat of sugar on top of the Crème brûlée was a little hard. Price: Affordable. Considered cheap for a hotel. (Which is good) Overall, my experience was a good one. The concept of the mini snack bar was great. It brought back a couple of good memories of my childhood. I would definitely come here again.

We stayed at the Adonis Hotel for a one night stay in July and decided to try the on site Argo restaurant for dinner. Could not have made a better choice. While the menu does not offer a huge range of dishes, what is offered is fantastic. The ribeye steak was cooked to perfection and tasted great. The lamb rack was also done to perfection. The service was prompt and very friendly and efficient. We enjoyed the dinner so much that we decided to dine here for lunch the next day as well and once again were very impressed with our meals. The atmosphere is very cosy. This restaurant appears to be quite popular with locals which says a lot about its quality. Prices were very reasonable. I would not hesitate to dine here again and to highly recommend it to others

Desperate booking in the middle of the night for a staff lunch the following day led to a reservation at Argo. Despite being a somewhat random choice, it turned out to be a delicious, value-for-money lunch in a nice setting. Not usually a fan of fusion-ish cuisine, but the chilli crab pasta was excellent.

The experince at Argo was a pleasant one. The restaurant is nicely decorated and each table even come with a scented candle. Food is tasty and prices are affordable. I strongly recommend it to anyone who's curious about checking this place out. Oh it's also a great place for date night too!

Love the free snack bar. My children love it.
Food is good and its value for money considering that they are also have a free snack bar.
5
Really love the pastas at Argo. Awesome service by the crew as well. Thank you for making it a pleasant experience.

Menu prices are different from the bill, waiting times for food was long which more than 20 minutes. However, the staffs are very friendly.
4
This is not my 1st time at Argo.
I like that I don't have to fight with a crowd for decent food at very reasonable (dare i say cheap) prices.

I like the ambience and food is good too. I would definitely come back again to try out more of their dishes. Will recommend friends to try out

We ordered a prosciutto fungi pizza and chilli crab pasta with soft shell crab. The pizza was ok, but the pasta was really wonderful! I love the crunchy garlic paired with chilli crab sauce and bits of crab meat, and topped with a soft shell crab. The sauce wasn't too spicy but on request, the chef could add little red chillies for extra heat. The price was very affordable too! I really enjoyed the food.
5
good food i like the rib eye steak how tender and tasty it was and it was complimented with a good sauce they even allow me to swap the fries into rice the pizza was also good they allow me to bring it into the roo

A rare place where we can bring our own wine (at no charge ) to accompany the sumptuous dinner. Though the selection in the menu is not a lot, the dishes and desserts served exceed our expectations (interns of pricing and ambience). The staff has good service attitude too
5
You will be pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food for the very reasonable prices you pay. We ordered the beer battered fish and chips, and the chilli crab pasta. The fish was succulent and coated in a light, crisp batter. The chilli crab pasta had enough zing in its spicy sauce. Servings were generous for under $15 each. You'd be hard pressed to find better alternatives even in the $20 range. We topped the meal off with tiramisu. The mascarpone could be less dense but no major complaints.
5
We had a very good carbonara and a pprosciutto pizza. The pandan dessert was a little bit overwhelming in terms of the pandan flavour, tiramisu was ok. It started to rain heavily and the staff offered to send us to the nearest building in an umbrella. Very kind of her! Thank you

Loved that the food and drinks were value for money, and the service staff were truly good! Good place to go for a relaxing dinner that is quiet enough for conversation.

Place was pleasant . Service was average as staff was lacking in knowledge but friendly overall. Worth going for a try

I would love liked to give it 3.5â˜… but there's no such rating.The Good:The prices are extremely reasonable.They have an awesome Carbonara Cremoso. The Chilli Crab Pasta is the 2nd best I've had (but since the best no longer exists, this takes 1st place now). The pasta is a little soft so remember to ask them to have it cooked a little more al dente.The Tiramisu is good, a little small but at $4 just order another if need be.The Bad:You can skip the pizza, the crust seems like it's store bought (rather hard). The mushroom soup was watered down, the waitress took my feedback and assured me it will be good the next time I visited.The Awesome:They are now a merchant with the Palate card, which means your meal could be could be cheaper then a meal at Food Republic!

Had lunch with my wife. Ordered the Chili Crab Spaghetti and the Argo Goreng Pasta. added a salad. For the portions served, definitely good value for money. The Chili Crab Spaghetti was better than the Argo Goreng Pasta but it could be a matter of taste. The free snacks were a nice touch. Staff were friendly and helpful

Ate here at night as we were too tired after a long flight to go out from the hotel.There was more choice on the menu than last year.Pasta and chicken ,fish&chips,some Asian dishes.Not a huge choice but I enjoyed my pasta carbonara and hubby enjoyed his fish and chips.Both well cooked and piping hot with not a long wait.Also very cheap.Cant complain about the portion size which was just enough

Food was generally good, we tried the beer battered fish & chips & soft shell crab pasta. It was also kind of them to provide free tidbits such as cashew & pistachio nuts, m&m, gummy bears etc while we wait for our food to be served. However it is not really a place to relax & chill - we found ourselves wanting to make a move to another chill out place for drinks almost immediately after we finished our food. Service was attentive, they topped up our water regularly.

We were staying at the Adonis Hotel where Argo Restaurant is located and decided to have dinner there one night. We were hot and tired and were more concerned about being cool and comfortable than about what we were going to eat. We were pleasantly surprised by our dinner choices which had an Asian influence even though the restaurant is basically Italian cuisine The prices were reasonable and the service was quick and efficient. There are a number of restaurants to choose from on Purvis Street but this might be the perfect choice if you are staying at the Adonis Hotel or other hotel in the area. The Adonis Hotel runs the restaurant as well so I think you will find them to be very friendly and helpful. I suggest that you check out there menu and give them a try if you are open to eating something other than the usual but also delicious cuisine found in Singapore

Service was excellent and food was reasonably priced (less than S$20 for a pasta). Decor was ok even though the air-conditioning was leaking a bit. Food was so-so
4
No complaints. Everything was good. Server was polite and friendly. It was not crowded and we were able to sit and chat till late. We ordered the fish and chips and carbonara which was both good. The carbonara was really tasty. Better than some restaurants in Italy. Mushroom soup was normal. Tiramisu is also not bad. Cocktail mango tango was also nice and sweet. Pricing was reasonable especially we had 50% off using Amex card. Will definitely come back again!

We ate here on a Saturday night after looking around the local area for somewhere that looked nice but reasonably priced. It's clean and well presented inside.. Though the first thing we noticed was it is heavily perfumed like a Hollister store (very strange!) and the music was proper cheese (but not unpleasant). We ordered pizza (takes 20 mins) and pasta. Both were very nice and cooked fresh. Service was fine (but I wouldn't go as far as saying attentive). All in we wouldn't hesitate going back, it made for a nice relaxed meal. Recommended
