Everytime I return to Singapore I go to this restaurant...
I simply love thier rame...especially shio ramen!
Their side dishes are also very good... and I recommend their apple/cranberry juice,
I've been to Japan and eaten ramen there...I have to say: I prefer aoba's.

Most ramen places in Singapore are quite, quite horrible. Aoba is one of the few which serves delicious ramen. We are happy that we made the right choice in trying it. At least our option for a good ramen place is no longer limited to those few places. The price is average pricing of a bowl of ramen in Singapore
