We’ll definitely come back. The service and food is top notch.
Call them for reservations, the queue is too long for walk ins.

Normally busy, it is better to make reservation weeks before hand. Love the freshness of the sashimi and and handrolls. Will be back for more.

Great Japanese buffet place! Very value for money and they have high quality food. The small portion allowed us to try a wide variety of food. Awesome!

We were lucky to get a table in the VIP room at a last minute booking (reserve a table in advance). The food was good, the prices were affordable at 38++ per person (adult) and 22++ per child between 3 and 6. I thought service could improve a little, but they could also be short on staff. The main restaurant's design is rather food eateries Japanese style. It's quite crampy, their VIP room wasn't all that big either, but comfortable. All in all, I think the place is worth making a visit too. My family seemed to enjoy themselves, and the waitress assigned to us was probably overworked. She could be a little bit friendlier though.

We’ve come to Ikoi a number of times (10+) and we cannot get enough of the food. The Sashimi is some of the best I’ve tasted, fresh and excellent value. They are unfortunately understaffed but they do make a lot of effort to make sure your enjoying yourself and are always extremely friendly. The tempura and other options on the menu are excellent, a must try is the Ebi Tempura and Sake Teriyaki. I’ve always recommended this restaurant to any friends or family visiting Singapore that enjoy sashimi.

Came here with my mum on Christmas as we missed Japan food after our holiday in Japan.The sashimi was soooo soooo good. It was exactly the taste we had in Japan. OhhhThe service was also very good. They tried their best to attend to everyone.The sashimi and sushi is really good. The tempura was also not bad. But the grill items were a little disappointing.VerdictIf you are looking for good sashimi, this is for sure the place u should go to

This was my fourth visit to Ikoi. They serve Japanese sushi buffet which is tasty yet reasonably priced.I had a poor service experience where the multiple items that were ordered, were not served. The service crew seems short-handed that night.I raised the issue of poor service and missing orders during dinner but nothing improved. So I decided to leave and upon making payment, I raised the issues again to the manager but she appeared lost or unfamiliar with handling complaints. I asked for a waiver of the service fees, instead she offered the missing order to be served to me. I told her that that should have been the service recovery when I was still having my dinner, instead of offering it after the dinner is over. She managed to give me a service charge waiver after struggling with the system but I have to applaud her for at least trying and making the situation better.I would still highly recommend Ikoi Japanese Restaurant for your sushi buffet fix

Jammed into the corner of a tourist hotel this restaurant is frequented mainly by locals. They do a buffet, which is the most popular, but we had a la carte and were very pleased. lots of raw fish, as you would expect, excellent miso and other delicious stuff I couldn't identify!Make sure you book. It is very ful
5
One of the freshest place to get your sashimi was recommended by your friends to this restaurant which was located right inside the hotel. Their soup in the Teapot is a must try! Don't give it a miss on that one of the best taste soup I have ever had! Most valuable for money on buffet!
5
By 6:45pm on a monday evening, the place is already completely filled. The food is by far the best of any Japanese ala carte restaurant we had tried in Singapore. Despite their business, the service staffs are quite cheerful and helpful. They even served us a free steamed salmon head.
5
The food here is amazing. Pricing is great! Service is great!
No complaints and a full double thumbs up!
3
Came back again after a couple of years and the dining experience was really disappointing. Food was really average, one of the chinese service staff was so rude. Not worth the $38++, won't be back. Rather go Sushi Tei.
5
The price for the buffet is very good for the quality of food served and the variety of menu items, very impressed for my first time. The seafood fresh and tasty, a rarity among buffets here.
5
Fish was SUPER fresh! As a sashimi lover, it might have been the best tuna and salmon I ever had. Lovely all you can eat, you take a seat and order whatever you want. Staff was super helpful and friendly! Serving tea through the whole dinner. We where sitting on the 'bar' area where we could see the sushi chef do his thing! Awesome night, thank you.
4
Ikoi is one of those hidden gems which not many people know of but it is really worth a visit. The food is good and the service prompt. It reminded me of some restaurants of Tokyo, which are compact, always bustling with people, and exude a feeling of warmth. If you are looking for a quite place then you need to avoid it though as it gets really busy during peak lunch/dinner times. However if you are looking for good food at very reasonable rates, then this worth trying
4
I have not been back to dine in the restaurant for about 2 years and I'm happy with the food quality. The service staff were fast efficient though there are obviously short handed. Today reservations has 2 seating. 1st at 5.30pm and 2nd at 8pm. Restaurant was full but food quality stay consistent and food took slightly longer
5
There was a long queue of youngsters outside Ikoi Japanese Restaurant during a weekend visit to Miramar Hotel. We decided to take a peep and were amazed that the restaurant had a beautiful lush Japanese setting and offers authentic Japanese cuisines. Well, good food deserves the wait and no wonder there was a long queue..
5
For non-local food, perhaps the best Asian buffet. Almost 50+ items to choose from, some pretty good quality Sake, quality sashimi and no limits on what you wish to repeat...all served happily with a smile until late evening. Has the spread of a buffet with the choice of a la carte dining. Very enjoyable and truly value for money

I've visited the shop with my friend on a Saturday. The shop itself is popular and need to do advance reservation before going.The size of the shop is not big and we're sitting on the counter seat.A small plate of salmon sashimi is already waiting for us on our seat as appetizer, which I find it quite thoughtful as it rescue my hungry stomach.The space is quite small but you can enjoy viewing the chef cutting and preparing the sashimi.The sashimi are fresh but I didn't consume much because I'm not a sashimi maniac.Both my friend and I shared the same opinion that the MVF (most-valuable food) of the night goes to Salmon Skin Temaki.It's simple yet so delicious. Crispy salmon skin topped with mayonaise and rolled over by rice and seaweed, one bite of it literally cures all my tiredness in work throughout the week.Highly recommended for you to try the Salmon Skin Temaki.Another tip: if you're ordering tonkatsu (pork cutlet), do remember to order more than 2 because the tonkatsu comes with small pieces, one piece is actually one bite size.The price is reasonable, S$38++ per person (around S$45 included 10% Svc charge & 7% GST) and you can enjoy fresh, unlimited sashimi
4
Food was very fresh and delightfully yummy, for both the raw and cooked dishes! Servers were polite and as quick as their feet could have brought them! (All the food were prepped on spot right aft they get your order, so it's bound to take some time to come - don't blame the messenger!) oh yes, that's another plus, freshly prepped food! We also didn't mind waiting 5-10 mins per order bc it's a buffet after all.. :> Ambience-wise, we thought it was cosy albeit slightly cramped. But at least the air-conditioning was strong and it was nice sitting there sipping tea, and enjoying fresh sashimi! In all, a worthy first-time and would def be back again! :)
5
excellent japanese food, and service here, just amazing, got to try out, and eat the food, enjoy the sake, and shochu.
2
Food was bad and no taste. The sashimi can cut into smaller pieces . Soup & steamed egg have no standard . Not following the Japanese style . The service staff are not friendly . The restaurant is too small and no room for movement
3
It has always been my favourite place for sashimi. Food are as usual. Sashimi is fresh. This was the 1st time experiencing service dropped from them even its not full house. Hope this can be improve. Will very much go again in the near future.
1
Service is almost non-existent. Servers tell you the food is coming but it doesn't.. Next moment another server tells you you have no more order
4
This highly sought after japanese buffet has been around for ages, and you will know why it has withstood the march of time when you dine. The cosiness of the restaurant can almost be mistaken as cramp, the endless movements of the servers only means you will have to try harder to get the attention because they are tremendously busy, and the single way to get through your meal with your sanity still intact by the end of it is to order smartly. The sashimi boats are a sight to behold, nobody does old school cool like they do. I enjoy the tempuras, the sushis and handrolls are made upon request and the sashimis are obviously a must order. Be patient and be kind to your servers/ the chef, they will appreciate it amidst the madness! I struck up a conversation with the sushi chef, and it was pleasant for me to know that the person preparing my food asserts more meticulousness when he sees you enjoying it. Bookings are a must.
3
We were at Ikoi to celebrate a friend's birthday, and went for the buffet ($38++ per adult and $22++ per child). The buffet comprised of sashimi, sushi, makimono, yakimono, tempura, agemono, sonota, menrui and gohan mono. The service was quite ok - staff were polite and attentive.
4
At $45 after taxes, think thick fresh slices of salmon, yellow tail, sword fish, tuna and octopus and many more other dishes that you can eat to your heart's desire. The table of 2 besides us a good 40 pieces of mixed sashimi! We also had the other popular items like salmon skin hand roll, grilled mid joints, California Maki and ebi tempura. The batter in the ebi tempura was a little on the thick side unlike the usual light crispy texture. Overall an enjoyable meal as always.
2
Had lunch buffet there on a Saturday and our experience wasn't that great. First there are many items unavailable from the buffet menu. Then garnish (radish) for our sashimi plate was off and old. Then rice balls were absolutely mashy just like think porridge. The only good thing is the sashimi which was nice and fresh. Overall disappointing experience for $45 per head.
5
The food is always yummy, and the quality of the sashimi great. There is always a difficulty getting any last minute booking, so book early to avoid disappointment.They would give us a private room because we always go in a big group. Always a pleasure
3
This was our second time to visit here and this time around service was pretty bad. Our first round of orders was not even served and we were way ahead of the other tables and they were getting their orders already. We didnt bother asking were our orders where but instead we ordered again. They did arrive but awhile later. The thing is in this kind of set up where its a buffet but ala carte style, they take so much time to deliver your order that by the time you have your food you are already close to full.The waitress we had asked who was pouring our tea that she take our orders told us that she will be back and she never did only to take the order of the other table. How can they loose your order when they take your orders on a stick-on paper and stick it on the kitchen thats gona prepare it. The food tasted bland despite the fact that they put too much umami.
4
Clean pleasant good sushi and tempura. Get a booth for full experience. Went on a Sunday for brunch and not too crowded. But hear otherwise during regular hours. Book ahead
4
nice place to eat
small and cozy
may be slightly cramped for the bigger sized people
good value for money
5
I eat Sashimi in this day more than I eat all of my life. The Sashimi bar kept serving me without me asking for anything. The shrimp tempura and the Sushi and Maki and Soup was amazing too.
Only for 32 USD.
4
My friend recommended this place and brought me and 2 other friends to try. We booked last minute so tables were no longer available but luckily we still had counter seating. The restaurant is small but cozy and has the vibe of an authentic Japanese restaurant. Some appetizers and our hot green teas were served immediately when we sat down. Our order for the grilled chicken wings only came after a reminder but they were very crispy and hot. The sashimi was fresh and tasty. I'm glad they had my favorite pickled mackerel sushi. The chawan mushi was also smooth and not salty or eggy. Too bad they don't have dessert included in the lunch buffet. The shrimp tempura and breaded shrimp were crunchy and delicious but the dipping sauce was very bland. The cold soba was edible but bland too. My friend liked the cold somen but I thought it was bland. The appetizers of cucumber, carrot, and celery were served in a cup filled with shaved ice which kept them chilled and fresh. The miso sauce for dipping them was also tasty. Overall I think their service was OK and I wouldn't mind going back except that I would book way in advance to be sure i get a table and go with a group of at least 4.
3
This place offered one of the freshest sashimi buffet albeit limited variety. If you have a big appetite for sashimi and Japanese food, then you will be able to offset the buffet cost. As dinners are always at the restaurant's peak, orders and service can be slow. Coupled with a time limit to your dining experience, with limited seating & table space, dining there can be both stressful and squeezy. However, if you are a regular there, you may just have faster orders and better service
5
Visited restaurant on 30 Nov, 2016. Been there several times with friends. Its buffet spread never fails to impress. Had the freshest sashimi. Serving was generous. Service was commendable. The ebi tempura and maki were yummy. The yuzu sorbet is out of this world. All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our meals at each visit. Cheers to the restaurant for having dished out food that delight most foodies' discerning tastebuds!

Saw the recommendation on hungry go where, and read some review that is always crowded and need advance reservation but it does not turn out to be that fantastic. For $38 buffet dinner sound good deal, but is only just ordinary japanese food nothing to shout about.The sashimi serving look generous, the tempura was tasteless, the shisamo fish not grill/fried enough. (not crispy) I order the oden and they serve me salmon belly miso soup. I was blurr/confused. I order grill salmon portion is small but is alright with me cause is enough only it taste like no seasoning at all. I think I cook more tasty salmon.Well overall is not really value for money, you dont get any quality food at all.and the christmas decoration is so ugly miss match. The place is so cramp and crowded the table are too close that your neighbour actually watching you eat.I'm sure there are many other Japanese restaurant that serve better food.Will never go back again
4
This is the first time we had our regular get together at this Japanese restaurant. It was Alacart buffet. The spread was very good indeed. For the price it really value for money. As all of us were there for the first time, we left the choice of dishes to the manager. All the dishes served were above our expectations. The shasimi comprising a variety of fish including salmon, tuna, yellow tail, etc was particularly fresh. Service may be a bit slow. But the attitude of the staff more than compensate for it.We were also celebrating the birthdays of 2 of our friends and upon request the kitchen was so kind as to make two cute little cakes made of Japanese rice for us.The service really made our day
3
Went for dinner to celebrate my daughter's birthday.The sashimi is fresh and served in big portions. We loved the yellow tail, tuna and salmon. The sword fish is a tad hard for my liking.My girls loved the Ebi tempura, Chawan mushi, satzuma imu (fried sweet potato) and salmon skin temaki (handroll). The tebasaki (grilled chicken wings) is not bad too.Also tried yakitori chicken, tomato bacon maki, cold soba, California temaki, ika tempura (cuttlefish), Saba shioyaki and shitake (mushroom) but are not really impressed.Service is friendly, prompt and good. My girl was given a birthday 'sushi cake'.Overall a good experience. Will be good value for money for sushi lovers
5
The staff are friendly, (especially Pei Ching, the Assistant Manager) the restaurant is always crowded on dinner and weekends. You gotta book at least a few hours in advance. The food is rrally good. Presentation is amazing plus its worth for your stomach. MUST TRY:- goma ice cream- salmon belly- salmon skin handroll- sushi sashimi- onion tempura- paper fis
4
Sushi s are really good and buffet offers a great range of choice.
Would definitely be my favorite sushi place if service was less hectic and personnel more attentive/efficient.
4
U get a great Japanese food for a very modest price - 38SGD For everything that you can eat. A bit overcrowded but the waitresses are very efficient given the number of constant orders they receive. Would definitely visit this place again!
4
The Sashimi was very fresh. Salmon belly is the best. The soup was also tasty.
The service was excellence.
4
sgd$38 for a good variety of fresh sashimi, nice vegetables tempura & grilled food. I didn't enjoy the ebi tempura and chawan mushi though.
5
This is a very popular restaurant. They serve varieties of small dishes which are cooked to perfection. Try their salmon skin rolls, grilled scallops, salted chicken wings, teapot soup, sashimi, roasted gingko and pregnant fish.
5
I have patronised Ikoi over 10 years and I dare say the Japanese food here is one of the best you can get in Singapore and good value for money ! The Sashimi is the Freshest and the portion served is unbelievable large. The reason Ikoi Sashimi is so fresh is because the day supply is always sold out and fresh supply is available for the next day diners. Though it is Buffet free flow order from Menu, the dishes are nicely propotion and perfectly cooked. The ambience of the restaurant is cosy, the staff are all very courteous and efficient in their service. I strongly recommend advance booking because Ikoi is usually fully booked. I have recommended many family members and friends to Ikoi..and all gave top grade to Ikoi! I highly recommend Ikoi Japanese restaurant to anyone who craves fo

A hidden jewel tucked away in Hotel Miramar, Ikoi receives a shipment of fresh sashimi from the Land Of The Rising Sun every morning. Thus, every dish is handmade with one of the freshest sashimi in Singapore. Each perfect little bundle of sushi or sashimi is amazingly handcrafted. This incredible restaurant's reputation for spectacular food has spread far and wide, so you'll have to reserve the day before to get a seat
5
I've made a last minute reservation. The staff informed me that only counter seats are available. After I agreed, I informed her that if there's a way, help us transfer to a table for 4. Alas! When I came for my reservation, they have prepared for us the table I requested. Besides the very helpful person on the phone, I noticed that all servers are friendly and smiling despite the fact that it was really busy for them. With regards to the food, all tasted amazing. All is fresh and didn't taste like how typical sushi buffets do, if you know what I mean. All in all, I would highly recommend this restaurant
5
The ala carte buffet in Ikoi is the real deal. For SGD38++ per person, I almost feel guilty about what they offer at such a steal. For children below ten, they charge SGD22++. The food is fresh and unlike those other buffets where the sashimi is just laid out for hours, Ikoi only serves what you order from their buffet menu. It's always fully booked so I highly recommend making reservations. I like to sit at the counter and catch the chef in action. They're very attentive and while they're busy preparing the orders, I find they actually listen when you're ordering from the waitress and would prepare your sushi order even before the waitress has a chance to put in the order chit at the station. Ikoi is located in Miramar Hotel and is a pretty small place, full of life and friendly chatter. Maybe not the right ambience for a romantic and quiet dinner. The service is good and fast, even when it is obvious they're a bit understaffed. Love this place, and never had a bad experience eating there.
5
Ikoi is a definite favourite of ours when we visit Singapore. The first time my boyfriend and I visited was for dinner last August during Singapore's 50th national day celebrations, so of course was fully packed at the time, so be sure to book in advance, especially around holidays! The restaurant is set in the Hotel Miramar lobby, which is about a 20 min walk or 5 min taxi ride from Clarke Quay, so a bit out of the way but is totally worth it. The restaurant itself is very nicely decorated, a traditional Japanese theme throughout. It's quite small and intimate but that just adds to the atmosphere. If you can, ask to sit at the sushi bar, as its great to watch the sushi chef prepare the dishes. At around $38++ you get unlimited options and servings from the menu. You can choose how many pieces of each dish you would like, just be careful not to order too much and waste any food (you wouldn't want to anyway as its all so delicious you'll eat everything in sight). We were fine with the speed of the service as it gave us time to look for more dishes to try, and savour the ones we had already ordered. Plus there was a lady that came around quite frequently to fill up our cups of green tea (one of the nicest we've tasted too!) They also came round and randomly offered you dishes you didn't order so you can try something different (you are free to decline these if you know you wouldn't like them). The menu was very extensive, offering everything from Maki and nigiri rolls, sashimi, rice and noodle dishes, teppanyaki, tempura, soups and grilled meat. The sashimi is excellent quality, some of the best I've ever eaten, and I don't mean in Singapore, I mean worldwide! We were stunned that we could order as much as we like of that and it all be included in the price. The second time I visited was with my sister in May for a lunch time serving. The restaurant was nearly empty (but it was very early at 11am when they first opened). Second time there and I still loved the food. Altho we didn't eat that much so not sure we got value for money on that trip. But you do get 3 hours for your table so there's no rush to leave.I would definitely recommend booking for dinner reservations as its a more lively atmosphere due to the buzz of activity. The next time I am back in Singapore I will definitely be stopping by once again.
4
Ikoi is one the longest Japanese buffet restaurant around for at least a decade or two! It serves one of the freshest sashimi and delicious battered tempura! Would recommend you to try it!
2
Not worth it..food takes a long time to arrive. 5 pax for $223 I think it's better to eat at a ala carte place...keep serving soup stuff as complimentary..when yr order is not served..
1
From the moment we walked in, the service was terrible. Waitress was rude, unfriendly, unhelpful and couldn't understand us.
The food was gross and way over priced.
4
Probably one of the best if not the best sashimi buffet in town, Ikoi has been around for awhile and has its far share of regulars. Despite the recent scare of individuals falling ill from consuming freshwater fish, the restaurant still attracts a crowd because it prides itself in serving quality fish prepared in the safest manner. There are other dishes on the buffet ala-carte menu (I know this is contradictory but to better explain it - you can order as many items as you want as you would be able to do so in a traditional buffet setting but the items are based on a pre-determined ala-carte menu). The only downside was that food service was pretty slow and you constantly have to require the service staff to check on your order, or re-order. If you're bringing a child along, there are booster seats for them. Space within the restaurant is limited hence you need to call in ahead to place a reservation, and if need be to have them arrange a space for you to place a pram, etc
5
The restaurant is situated inside Hotel Miramar. It is not reachable through walking from Clarke Quay MRT station, advisable to take a cab to go directly to Hotel. Otherwise, you can take bus no 51 that stop right in front of the hotel. Reservations need to be booked one week in advance. When i arrive there, people were queueing up to get in. It is that packed. They serve delicious fresh seafood, and I particularly enjoy the sashimi selection provided. Sword fish is a must try, really succulent and tender and fresh. They also serve maki, sushi rolls, tempura and udon to our liking. Deserts are not included inside the buffet price but you may order if you like. The restaurant also provides 2-3 complimentary dishes which may come in soups or something else. Due to the shortage of servers, we had to wait for some time before food arrives. Otherwise, I will definitely come here again, with the fresh selection of seafood and value for money
4
Having not revisited Ikoi for some 6 years, the family decided to rekindle our acquaintance with the Resturant to celebrate a Milestone birthday. The food came fast n furious and we were filled by good food as well as the return of great memories of past great meals. The empty dishes stood happy testimonial to our satisfaction, also grandson's bulging tummy after only 4 bowls of udon. Whether the prices are justified may be cause for debate as there are many options for good quality Japanese food all over Singapore today, as compared to when Ikoi first opened it's doors. Overall, I think the family enjoyed the experience.
4
We had heard rave reviews from our friends about Ikoi and decided to try it out for ourselves. From reviews on the Internet, it was recommended to make dinner reservations early as the place is easily packed. As it was only 3 days to our anniversary, decided to try our luck by emailing them and was so blessed when they called to ask what timing we would like to make reservations for. We were told that being a weekend, they would be having 2 settings:- 5.30-7.30pm where the last order would be at 7pm for the first seating and 8pm - 11pm for the second seating. We decided on the first timing and as we had gone for a test drive, we were slightly delayed. We then received a call from the restaurant. Good follow up. We arrived just after 6pm and ordered most of our favourite dishes as well as asked for their recommendations. It was a wonderful dinner.Service was fast. Food was yummy especially the sashimi which came in nice thick slices. Overall found the dinner to be value for money. Will definitely be back for more interesting Japanese dishes. We had a pleasant surprise when, upon leaving, one of the waitress asked us to wait as they were preparing a sushi in a heart shape for our anniversary. How sweet! A pleasant surprise...

At S$38 you can have a sumptuous fresh sashimi and sushi buffet on the ground floor of Miramar Hotel, Havelock road.With assortment of fresh salmon, hamachi, sword, maguro, octopus you are spoilt for choice with unlimited servings!Sushi of reversed rolls and handrolls of salmon skin which i always add salmon belly to enhance it further. You can also ask for california roll. Fried items like tempura ebi with no limit at all yes no limit to satisfy your crave together with assortment of vegetables are on the list.Udon with beef, fried shishamo and yakitori are also offered.With many Tripadvisors certificate of excellence it is certainly a place not to be missed with value for money and skill of Charlie, Daniel, Keong and many kitchen staff and loyal servers

We visited this Japanese restaurant for the 1st time on 30 April 2016. IKOI is tucked away in a relatively obscure corner on the lobby of Hotel Miramar which is within the popular food and entertainment enclave of Havelock Road. Modest as it may appear, this unassuming Japanese outlet has a cosy ambience which is conducive for business lunch, and especially for weekend family get-together. Instead of the popular Japanese buffet, we opted for the Ala Carte dishes and were richly rewarded with excellent servings of fresh sashimi, sushi and handrolls; the battered, grilled and fried dishes were cooked to perfection and much to our likings. Even the modest miso soup exceeded our expectations - it was hot, it was delicious! Besides the scrumptious dishes, we were equally impressed by the quality of the service staff - fast, friendly and attentive, despite the restaurant more than half-packed on that day. Our experience was made more delightful and momorable as we were able to watch in full view the top chef's dexterity in cutting and preparing the sashimi dishes. Indeed, this was a memorable lunch worthy of special mention....and worthy of another visit
4
Despite them having a sign saying to bear with their service due to the labour crunch, piping hot food was promptly served and it was delicious! Where would you find this kind of quality? Sure they've removed some items from their default buffet menu and you have to order it ala carte but they've still got a wide range of food available in small portions. Think of it as boat noodles style. Not much pix as we were busy eatingLove the ice cream air flown from Japan
4
Every order freshly made, from tempura to sushi/sashimi and many other dishes. Green tea included. Small restaurant with Japanese vibe to it.
5
This quaint little restaurant has a middle counter area where you can watch the chef deftly create little morsels of sashimi and sushi goodness. The waitresses were very kind and understanding towards my needs as a parent of a young toddler, and quickly anticipated my needs. The range of food on offer is what you'd expect in Japan, fresh and lovely flavours! The teapot soup especially and grilled nasu and miso paste was divine! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great place to entertain guests, have a private celebration or even bring their family to. I would go back again and again every time I go back to Singapore
5
Tucked away on the fringe of the city lies a little restaurant serving one of the best Japanese ala carte buffets you can find that's reasonably priced. Food is served in small individual portions that are freshly prepared and served to you hot direct from the kitchen. Some may appear really tiny but it helps to minimise food wastage and well, it means you get to try more items. The menu is extensive and you can't possibly try everything on it. Slight wait for certain dishes but the wait is well worth it.Seafood like sashimi are fresh. Order a couple of portions at once to get a decent sized platter to share.Stay for desserts, a top up but very refreshing, especially their airflow sorbets
3
The buffet do not have a wide range of choice. 1 & 1/2hr for buffet and we did not enjoy it as it was really rushing. The food came out slow as the staff were trying their best to coup with the masses. The sitting space are tight & uncomfortable and the table next to you could even hear you burp. No more 2nd time, Thanks
5
Introduced to this Japanese restaurant years ago, I look forward to dining here at least once on each visit to Singapore (1-2 years) Combines great service, friendly staff, delicious foods served with exquisite attention to detail and presentation. Japanese izakaya (tapas/small dishes) and hot dishes can be ordered
4
For the Singapore standards this restaurant is very cheap. High quality all you can eat Sushi and Sashimi for SGD 38++ is very cheap. The staff is very nice, the restaurant is nicely decorated and not noisy. Not a high end food, but definitely worth the price. Reccomended
4
If you have not been to this small little shop in Singapore for Japanese sashimi, you should take a trip and test it out. It's fresh and has rather good variety of raw fishes. While Its a buffet the way it operates is more like ala-carte dining and thus food is prepared only after you ordered the item.Freshness is guaranteed but if you are in a rush for time it can be a mistake. So make time to enjoy the food when you can. They had a recent turn over of most of their servers, so make sure your server understands what you are ordering to minimize miscommunication.Reservation if highly recommend to be placed a week in advance, if you don't have any to be disappointed. Great for couples as well as small company dinner as they have a room for those events
3
At above $40 per person for al la carts buffet is cheap but the selection is average. However, if you are a sashimi lover and doesn't want to pay at high price, I koi is the choice. For the last 15 years, the service had been slow perhaps this is the trick of serving buffet. Serve slow,meat slow, full stomach. You have to wait for 25 mins for most dishes so order as many as possible early
5
Ikoi celebrate 15th anniversary they serve more complimentary dishes like snow king crabs, grilled unagi, grilled prawns etc. You don't get these during normal day. Their sashimi is still the best very fresh and thickly cut. They will ask sashimi how many pieces? â˜º Price is still the same 38++ for adult n child 22++. There is 2 time slot to choose when making reservation.

This popular restaurant in Miramar hotel was recommended by our local Singapore friends and we were not disappointed when we went to check it out on this trip to Singapore. The ala carte buffet offered is different as we can choose from a huge menu of sashimi, sushi, tempura, grilled, rice and noodle dishes. They also offered complimentary starters and soup dishes throughout our meal. The sashimi and sushi were freshly prepared by two chefs at stations in the middle of the restaurant. Staff were helpful and friendly and our tea was constantly topped up. We enjoyed our meal and it was definitely good value for S$38. Will come back again

Everything is so fresh and the atmosphere is very friendly. Service is very nice and the prices are acceptable. Recommended!

A wide spread of delicious Japanese food. Indeed a good place to go with friends and family. The food is so fresh and tasty especially the sushi!!!!!.
5
Recently I went there with a group of friends. The buffet spread was so awesome we couldn't stomach anymore. The sashimi was really fresh especially the salmon belly. The sake was good too. Will go there again definitely.

Loved the sashimi! Truly fresh and tasty! Quite a good range of food from raw to fried to grilled. Grilled mackerel was a tad dry and tough, yakitori was sweet and moist.

Good and fresh authentic Japanese cuisine to die for. A place for the Japanese food fanatic, what's more... It's a order to make buffet Japanese restaurant.

it's an all you can eat a la carte buffet restaurant and if you don't particularly care about the quality of the produce and just want to fill your belly with as much protein as you can humanly consume, then ikoi is ok.problem is, they are stingy with the food. you have to order and order and order and you almost always get the feeling that they judge you when you ask for seconds. i was invited twice, and each time i got the same feeling -- and the some of the fish served you could taste the ice crystals in each bite. just totally rubbish.great for army kids though ... a group of 8 hungry soldiers can clean the restaurant out in one sitting

If you’re really into Japanese cuisine, then this restaurant is somewhat of a hidden gem in the Clarke Quay area of Singapore. It is located inside the Hotel Miramar. It is a little out of the way and about a 20 minute walk from either Chinatown, Outram Park or Clarke Quay MRT’s, but it is well worth it! So for around 35 SGD you get a full Japanese buffet with complimentary tasters and free flow of green tea, the menu is huge so there is a vast amount to try. Portions are also quite generous so be careful not to order too much at one time especially because there isn’t a lot of space!The place itself just WOW, the restaurant is relatively small but very cosy and has such a great atmosphere, lovely décor and helpful staff. You can either ask to sit at a table or at the bar. I would say sit at the bar, as it felt like a truly authentic Japanese experience, where you can see the chef preparing Temaki and Sashimi which is good to see. You are not rushed by the staff and have 3 hours for the table and 2 hours to order what you like. (All customers are brought in at the same time either 5pm or 8pm)The food was some of the freshest I have ever tasted and the Tuna and Salmon sashimi tasted like it had just been caught, so I highly recommend it! Everything was presented beautifully and there is definitely something for everyone, Sushi, Sashimi, Tempura, Noodles, Rice, Soups and Grilled Meat.Be sure to put this place on your bucket list for Singapore however, do book at least a week in advance to avoid disappointment. (Also don’t let the appearance of the Miramar Hotel put you off!

This restaurant is serves authentic Japanese food. You have the choice of ordering set dishes from the menu as we did or ordering the buffet. The buffet is not the smorgasbord type - there is a chef in the middle of the restaurant who prepares the buffet dishes. The atmosphere is good and the service was great. Set dishes were about 18 Singapore dollars and the buffet double that. The drink list is very Japanese, and like in most places in Singapore, alcohol is not cheap. Booking is essential as this is a busy little restaurant

First, please understand that this place is a low key, relaxed, small (for about 25 guest) specialized Japanese restaurant. Me and my daughter were the only foreigners there yesterday and the place was packed solid. There are two seatings, one for lunch 11-14 and dinner 18-21. You have to call for booking. Do not expect champagne fountains and Evian water because they don't offer it. What you get us the finest selection of sashimi, sushi, maki, tempura, soups, noodles, green tea, salads and BBQ food for "eat all you want" for about 40 SGD. menu is extensive and for a foreigner 80% unknown. You order from the menu, all at once, do specify how many slices/ pieces you want as they don't waste any food here which I like. I recommend you focus on the tuna/swordfish/yellowtail sashimi as they were the best I've ever had (better than Nobu). All other dishes were delicious too, but sashimi really stands out. If you feel full you simply ask them to stop serving any additional food. Fantastic selection of sake, which we had with our meal, most being sold in 300ml bottles. Some language problems were quickly solved. Kind and effective service. Service charge of 7% and additional tip resulted in manager being called for translation, so it doesn't seem to be a custom. We've had so much fun being faced with lots of tiny dishes which we seem to use wrong, trying unknown tastes and combinations. Western Japanese restaurants just don't offer that. A must try in jungle of star hotel buffet and Sunday brunche

Managed to find this place on reviews and after last night's visit, I wasn't disappointed.Right in the lobby of the hotel, the entrance looks small and non-striking but right inside past the main doors the ambiance is totally different. Feels really like in japan!The food is amazing,. As per reviews the food portion is small so its totally manageable. Sashimi is simply the best - fresh and thick slices. Any other items you order on the menu is made fresh and hot too! Good value buffet definitely!Definitely coming back again soon! Reservations definitely, else be prepared to wait for long
5
Love coming here with friends.
Food is awesome and the ambiance is great. However, expect the food and service to be a bit slow when the restaurant is packed with people.
5
When you walk in this restaurant, it reminded me a lot of the pleasant Izakayas of Tokyo. The decoration, the conversations, the mood and decoration.The all you can eat buffet is just AMAZING. Fish is very very fresh, and the hot dishes are also so tasty.They come in small portions, which is makes it easier to try a little bit of everything.Service is great, and a very polite lady will refill your green tea whenever it's about to end.I've been to many all you can eat japanese buffets, and I can safely say this is one of the best. Specially because of the different dishes, and for the real japanese feeling of it. This place is inside Miramar hotel, ground floor. Just go in through the main door and you'll spot the entrance

It's been some years, since I last dined at Ikoi. At one time it was a regular and favourite haunt. But boredom set in and tastes changed. So, last night's visit was greatly anticipated. Would the food quality and preparation still be good or a disappointment? Would the staff be friendly? Have the prices gone up? What about the ambience? Nothing to fret. It felt like all our previous visits. The food was fresh and of high quality. The staff friendly though you could notice a slow down in service. Maybe due to the shortage of labour... though I thought the work flow and processes could be improved. Prices have gone up but not too high. It was a Monday night and the place was packed. Great place to catch with family and friends over a good meal. The tables are close to each other, so business discussions may not be so private. It's still great value for money and I am going back again soon. Don't forget to make table reservations and turn up on time. If not, your table is gone to the a walk-in. Have a great meal
5
I go to Ikoi whenever I need my sashimi fix. They serve generous cuts of fresh sashimi and the a la carte buffet leaves one spoiled for choice. Excellent tempura too. Despite the occassionally service (this place is ALWAYS full), you will always leave this restaurant deeply satisfied

Within the Mirimar hotel, we stumbled on this right next to the lifts. We were the only Europeans eating there, which perhaps indicated its popularity with the locals. The meal was a fixed price and the Malay couple we shared a table with recommended the dishes to try. Excellent valu

Went here a couple of times for their sashimi and whatnot. Though the time to get our fiod was a little slow, i think it was worth the wait. The salmon and other seafood dishes were fresh and tasty The seafood soup was heavenly. End the meal with yuzuru sorbet. Worth it :
5
Luv this restaurant for its plentiful big cut sashimi that is fresh.With a big following even though the price is around S$50 you have to make a reservation and worst still on the tatami mat you have to reserve one month in advance! My favourite is at the chef's counter where there is rapport with conversation and service. It is a buffet place whereby they are generous, you eat your fill for money well spent. About 4 different sashimi is served with no limit except wastages. 2 soups are served - I like the tea pot one as it is sweet from the broth. Ebi and assorted vegetables are deep fried to perfection. I usually order in advance when my ebi tempura arrive as it is a long wait for the next order. Variety of sushi are on the menu and my favourite is the salmon skin as I can add my individual salmon which give a further plumb crispy taste to it. While waiting a cold salad of celery, cucumber and tiny tomato are served in a tall glass together with steamed peas in the pods. Savouring all these fresh morsels with hot sake is the ultimate sensation that you don't want to miss.A good generous serving is

Japanese food is one of my favorite foods and I always enjoy going for Japanese buffet one restaurant I would recommend for the buffet style has to be Ikoi Japanese Restaurant it’s located at the lobby of Hotel Miramar Havelock road. This place I have been introduced by a very good Singaporean friend and ever since that introduction, I never looked back. The price is affordable and worth it, to me it’s one of the cheapest and best buffets Japanese restaurants in town

Have been visiting this place since university days. The standard of food has never disappoint. Whenever I get allocated for counter seats (due to many reservations), I appreciate how the staff would auto move my reservation to table seats once available. Dined there yesterday and it being a Public Holiday, I went with lower expectations. However, they had enough staff. Every dish ordered came pretty quick, except for the sashimi. Noticed a few trainees, all were alright except for Crystal who never failed to put down each dish noisily. My partner noticed it as well. Hope management trains her well, as I believe Japanese/Japanese restaurants have high food and service standards. Will visit again, for my Japanese buffet fix
4
Come here hungry as the food will be endless ! Unlike many buffet that focus on quantity instead of quality, Ikoi emphasizes on both good quality food with good fresh ingredients and they arrive for as long and as much as you can eat. The sushi and sashimi are fantastic as well as the cooked food like the tempura. There's also noodles, rice , miso soup, maki etc.. The service is quick . Unlike a standard buffet spread, the items here are done ala minute after you place the order. The decor is quite simple but very cosy with a true vibe of a lively japanese restaurant. It can get a bit noisy and the resturant does get full very quickly. Do make reservation in advance 
2
Staff service was terrible as had to face staff with long sour faces. Wasted time waiting for food items to appear at table, too way too long. Not recommended!
4
The food is excellent but they were very understaffed when we visited which meant long waits for everything we ordered. The staff who were be tried their best so we couldn't really complain. Def worth a visit as the food really is good
5
Totally fabulous! Must go again! Been twice. Both great experience. Wikl definitely visit again! However, all diners must remember to call up & make reservations in advance. Walk-ins will either have to wait long time or ... =p

$38++ = $45 per pax for buffet. Order from the menu given. We heard about their slow service, so we tried to beat that by making a 6pm reservation, and it worked! We ended up not feeling that the service was particularly slow at all. There were lots of food to choose from, and we're definitely going back. The sashimi portions were generous, and super fresh. And we loved how the portions given for food can be easily controlled and we got to try a huge variety of food. Recommended

Was craving for sashimi and decided to try Ikoi from the online reviews. The sashimi was fresh but service speed was slow. perhaps it was intentional so we had other food in between to fill our stomach. its obvious that service staff really tried their best to serve everyone as fast as they can. In a buffet ala carte restaurant, they are continuously speeding from table to table. Still, waiting time can be lengthy when its full house. Chawamushi was so-so. The tomato bacon was interesting and a must try. Complementary soup was delicious as vouched by many. Can try if you are looking to eat volume. If you are going for great quality sashimi, best to go to other mid-high end restaurants
4
Friend reccommend me there! Nice interior, and sashimi is so good. Upon request, we get to eat at the comfy table whereby we gotta take out our footwear. While waiting for my rest of my friends to come, there were some complimentary items to start trigger our appetite. Sashimi is so good that we order 20portions of it. It literally melts in your mouth. I would reccomend the curry rice and the bacon with tomato. The rest of the food are pretty average japanese food. Service may be a bit slow during busy period, but would come again for the sashimi!
4
Had patronise this restaurant for uncountable times and got to admit this restaurant still serve the best and freshest sashimi that I ever eaten. Most importanly is you can order as many times you want since its buffet thus is very valuable for money. Price is around $35-$40 per pax. Reservation a few days before (especially dinner) is highly recommended because it will be full house very quickly. Overall its a good restaurant. Do note that waiting time is really really long when the restaurant is packed especially festive season, but their service are ok ^
5
If you are a fan of sashimi, this is the place to go. The types of sashimi offered are more than those offered at other a la carte buffet places: swordfish, octopus, tuna & of course salmon. (There are at least 2 more but I can't remember what type of fish.) The sashimi cut is satisfyingly thick & the fish is wonderfully fresh. And when you first arrive, there's a delicious salmon sashimi starter that's the house special. And all this is on top of the amazing selection. I love the salmon skin handroll & the tempura!Charlie the owner is a warm & gracious host & his team will efficiently get the orders right (& we order a LOT! Lol.) They seem shorthanded at times but that's because the restaurant is always full! We normally make our reservations at least 4 weeks in advance to get our favorite table
5
My 2nd visit here n they have maintained their standard and quality of Sashimi n services!It's quieter here on a weekday dinner time slot. So the services and speed which the food was prepared was a lot faster!As usual we are here for the Sashimi n we were not disappointed! This time only the Hamachi is not available. Our all time favorite is still the Mekajiki (sword fish) which melts in your mouth!Complimentary Soup in a Teapot is always a delight!Will look forward to our next visit

I was first intrigued by the entrance of this restaurant in Hotel Miramar - it is quite unique with Japanese Lanterns adornments. My friend recommended this place to me and I absolutely love it. But beware though because the food is good there is almost always a crowd and you might not have a place to sit. Reservations not allowed during weekends if I remember correctly. But, the food is good, so might be worth the wait. =
4
I finally managed to book seats after few tries on various occasions...
purely went for sashimi n sushi...sashimi was fresh and sushi portion very well made...
when full house expect to wait very long for your food to come...
another value for money Japanese restaurant...

Today, Celine* and I decided to head to Ikoi Japanese Restaurant for lunch in the rain, just to satiate our sashimi cravings. It was a rather last minute decision, and I was surprised that she managed to make reservations in the morning for our noon-time lunch. Anyway, the well-known Ikoi Japanese Restaurant is located at 401 Havelock Road #01-01 Miramir Hotel, Singapore 169631 and the number for reservations is 6887 3788.The restaurant has a rather sleek but simplistic, classically Japanese design - clean white and light brown tones, open concept and colorful tatami seats. Yes, we were fortunate enough to be given a Tatami seat even though there were just two of us, and it was my first time sitting this way - rather comfortable.While browsing through the menu, we were being served the complimentary items such as the sumptuous Salmon Sashimi slices drenched in a lightly-flavored sauce, and the small teapot of Seafood Soup that I have missed since my last visit here years ago. The Sashimi was very fine and meltingly tender, and the seafood soup was tasty as ever, especially with the squeeze of lime wedge into it.Very quickly, they brought us the first items of our order. The Shisamo which I have swo rn off during my last Japanese restaurant visit. This was an order by mistake, and the sinful recollection of its deliciousness when I was here years back - well, it is still delicious and filled with roe. The Agadeshi Tofu was lovely too - meltingly-crispy skin and sweetly smooth insides, floating in a plate of light soy sauce.Next, the dish of Cucumber slices with accompaniment of tasty, savoury Miso beans - a refreshing delight. The lightly-salted and soft Edamane beans which made for a good snack in between waits. And the California Temaki - handroll with cucumber sticks, crabmeat, omelet and Japanese rice rolled in large sheet of seaweed - tasty and crunchy.They brought us our Sake Maki - salmon sashimi with mayonnaise. The tiny dices of salmon sashimi bits stuffed into sticky Japanese rice, rolled into seaweed and sprayed with mayonnaise - was a combination of crunchiness, tenderness and deliciousness all rolled into one.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/03/lunch-at-ikoi-japanese-restaurant.htm

It was my second time at Ikoi and the place was packed, with even every seat at the sushi and sashimi counters fully occupied. Reservations were made two weeks ago by my friends and we were seated at the sashimi counter. The tuna, salmon and marlin sashimi were fresh. There were also octopus and squid sashimi. But that was about all the sashimi on offer. I could not even have a tamago (egg) sashimi. Instead it comes in sushi form, with rice on it. They do not make exception. Everything that is stated on the buffet menu could be ordered if it is available. The shrimp tempura was okay. Ikoi had a special braised salmon head during lunch that day and it was offered to us. It was quite good but I would have preferred it grilled instead. The waitresses were constantly busy but fast and efficient.For big eaters who love sushi and sashimi, Ikoi is the place to be. Otherwise, better head elsewhere. At S$38++ for lunch, it is not exactly cheap for people with small appetite. For those who are looking for quality, Ikoi is average
4
Umpteen visits to Ikoi and i will still recommend this place for friends who are very into sashimi. Their choice of sashimi may be restricted to the main fish types but the freshness is always there. Other choices of Japanese food is authentic and tasty! buffet dinner is at $38++ so if you are not those who can eat lots, it may sometime sound more worth it to order ala carte at a restaurant elsewhere.
4
Went there for the 1st time, tried to make reservations several times but always fully booked... The place is kinda cramp, especially if u are seated at the sushi bar another point to note is that the restaurant is not very pram friendly due to the limited space & huge crowd.All those aside, they serve very good sashimi. The sashimi is fresh & the chef cuts pretty thick slices for you. Other than that, the rest of the food is pretty nice, but for me, i mostly eat just sashimi...Definitely a must go for family/friends gathering. If your body is on the heavy side (like me), try not to take the sushi bar seats coz u will feel cramp
4
One of my favourite Japanese restaurants - a reasonably priced eat-all-you-want Japanese buffet is a dream come true! the salmon and tuna sashimi is my favourite, always fresh - no restrictions on how much you can eat! their special soup is fantastic. This is a restaurant i love coming back t
5
My family & I have always enjoyed dining at IKOI but never thought of reviewing it.The restaurant is in Miramar Hotel, an old but decent hotel dating back to the 1970s (or even older). The restaurant itself is not very big but always crowded, especially on weekends. Reservations is a must (average waiting time is about a week!)Ambiance is that of a rather traditional good Japanese eatery - small & cramped. Don't expect posh settings. Instead the focus is on its food - always fresh & value for money. At SG$38 ++ per head for al a carte buffet of shashimi (tuna, yellow tail, salmon, squid & all the normal selection), tempura, soba, rolls, etc., it does not get any better than that.There is an a la carte menu for more dishes, but we have never tried it.The staff is pleasant but normally quite busy. If you enjoy simple Japanese fare, you HAVE to try this
3
This is a la carte buffet and not expensive, so it's good for big appetites, and childrenManaged to snag the 8pm seating on a saturday (the earlier one is 6pm) and they said only counter seats are available. Actually the counter seats are better, for small groups, as i like to chat with the chefs. The staff just don't know what's better The menu is extensive, minus the expensive items like uni , beef and ikura, hence the lowish $38 price. Another reason is most of the fish don't come from japan. The sashimi is indeed quite good and fresh, but not excellent, which is within expectations. The handrolls, chawamunshi, prawn tempura and other small items average. They have some items like chicken skewer, chicken wings etc. that just comes with 1 pc per serving, so remember to tell them how many you want, otherwise only 1 person gets to eat itYou'll probably have to order as much as you can during the 1st order. It is very difficult to get their attention as they start serving and running around. We told 4 times before we had our 2nd order taken. This under normal circumstances border on rude service but here, they are just super busyIf they add the really good stuff and maybe $20 extra if they have to, i may return to try i
5
I've been patronizing Ikoi Japanese Resturant for years and they never fail to serve me the freshest sashimi each time. The sashimi served is fresh, and comes in thick slabs. If you are a sashimi lover like me, the best thing is that you can order as much as you want as they serve in ala carte buffet style. I also like their handrolls, especially their Ebi handroll and salmon skin handroll as the seaweed is crisp (which means it's freshly made!). The rest of the items on the menu are also fantastic. You really have to try it to know it yourself. Staffs are also friendly and approcable. It is however, best advised to book 1-2 weeks in advance to ensure you secure a reservation as it is usually fully booked. Overall I will still continue to come back for their food as it is money worthy for the great quality of food that they serve. I think it costs about $38++ per person if I am not wrong, not too bad for a japanese restuarant that serves quality japanese food in buffet style ya

We booked a table on Saturday afternoon and managed to get a 6pm table which was fortunate, as we arrived we realised not many diners yet so maybe that is the trick to go earlier. By about 7pm it is very full. The restaurant is small so seating is tight and its elbow to elbow. However the buffet is great value and they have many of the Japanese dining favorites on the menu. Don't expect the food to be cutting edge culinary but definitely worth the buck you pay for. The sashimi, sushi, tempura are of good quality and eating a few rounds of it will definitely give you a sense of satisfaction that you had a good meal. Small gripe is that their menu is still relatively the same after so many years of visiting them, I guess if it ain't broke don't fix it but sometimes wish they can throw in some additional promotional or seasonal dishes from time to time
5
Been to the buffet many times now and it is still great. Didn't book but was lucky to always hav a table. A definite for sashimi lovers.
4
Great Sashimi. The decor is rather 'food-court', but the food is excellent! It can get quite busy so get there early.
5
We have fell in love with this restaurant. Did not have reservation so just tried to walk in and luckily got seated around the counter. Paid 38 ++ per all you can eat buffet. Selection was from sushi to grilled fishes and meats, we have fell for sushi and it was perfect choice - sashimi and nigiris were amazing (in both prep. and freshness), selection of rolls is limited but those they have also did they job :-). Staff was helpful but quite busy and affected their short answers. Place is little noisy but we liked it and its just atmosphere of that place. Definitely recommendationsDefinitelly recommendation

Being a Japanese food lover, for the price, I feel that it is fair enough.Of course, there are more better shops around. I have also seen many negative feedbacks for here, but I do not think it is as bad as what they commended, there are many more other places which are worse.This has been the first time since I went back after more than many years, as I know this place, without reservation, it is real hard to get a table and most Singaporeans like to only decide where to eat quite last min, but this is not a good choice if you have no plans in advance.Of course, I think the sashimi is what everyone is craving for.. but I feel it was not as good as few years back. But of course, this is my personal preference as over the years, I have been eating many nice Japanese food, so when you go back to the first place where you have nice Japanese food, the expectation is higher and you are unlikely to feel that they were better unless they really have improved too.Worth to plan a day, book a few weeks in advance give it a try to avoid disappointment. :
5
Feel like you are in Japan. Meaning that you literally eat elbow-to-elbow with other diners. But the food is very good, if you are lucky you have nice neighbours, and the service - despite being fully packed - is quick enough not to leave you without food. On the contrary, on the tiny table not much food fits. A buffet dinner where everything you order - and you have a big "buffet-menu" to select from - comes freshly prepared, be it sushi or sashimi or tempura or some yaki fish, (I love shishamo, and they are nice and full of roe as they should be).A messy place? Yes. But it is fun. Lots of people celebrating the CNY period, merrily drinking and eating, without the eccesses that you may find in China. This is Singapore. And this is a good restaurant to try. If you have never been to Japan, you will be as close as it can get to it
5
The Ikoi restaurant is situated in the lobby of the Miramar hotel in downtown Singapore. I went with some friends of mine who had been before which not having eaten Japanese food before was a little reassuring. However when we arrived and eventually got a seat (it was absolutely stacked) the waitress very kindly took over and ordered for us. She bought beautifully prepared raw fish. Soup, chicken, cooked fish, bacon, tempura prawns etc, etc served with a variety of sauces, mustard and vinegar accompanied by green tea and I can honestly say I was more than surprised by just how much I enjoyed my first Japanese food eating experience. Very tasty, very satisfying and very different
4
I found Ikoi on Trip Advisor after looking for good restaurants in my neighbourhood. I was surprised to find out that it was actually an all-you-can-eat buffet. The place was pretty crowded, but there was no wait for seats. It had a good friendly atmosphere. All of the food was of a pretty good standard. The only gripe would be the waiting time between orders. But overall I was happy. For the price, I definitely recommend the buffet
5
If you love Japanese cuisine you MUST visit IKOI restaurant located at the ground floor of the Miramar Hotel. Owners Charlie and Judy together with their attentive staff will welcome you on arrival and make you feel right at home. My family and I have been to IKOI on numerous occasions and they never fail to produce the best food and service each time! Freshest sashimi, sushi, hand rolls, teriyaki n tempura items, and many more delicious eats are offered non stop. Reservations at least 1 week ahead are recommended especially on weekends, though they will do their best to accommodate. Great food great value great service! Keep up the fabulous work IKOI!Ida Fred and the Ong family

You would never expect a bustling place like this inside a hotel. Friendly service and delicious food (I had the salmon terriyaki). Regarding previous reviews: yes, service might be a little slow if you don't take the buffet. Yes, small tables, so if you want privacy, stay in your room. And yes, book in advance

For complete write up and photos, please visit http://paotothelo.wordpress.com/Who doesn't love Japanese Food?I dont know anyone who does not have Japanese on their top 3 favorite cuisines - it sits comfortably next to Italian Cuisine on my list.Ikoi Japanese Restaurant offers good quality Japanese ala carte buffet at a very reasonable price
4
Service is slow and erractic. There's no privacy and the restaurant is cramp and packed. However, the food never fails.
3
Loves only the complimentary teapot soup and the salmon belly sashimi.
5
filling buffet! very fresh sashimis!
4
Value for money buffet. I don't like buffet but this place is decent to keep me going back. Make sure you make reservations!
4
Probably one of the few really good ala carte japanese buffet restaurant one can ask for. When coming here, make sure you are a sashimi lover and you'll find that paying $30++ for the meal is definitely worth it. Sashimi is very fresh and well cut, and a good selection. If you are looking at the rest of the menu, it may not boast a good variety but it is of good quality. Service is good and friendly as well! I dont have to think twice about going back there again. Expect large crowds though so be sure to make reservations a week in advance
5
From the moment we sat down, we have the sense that this restaurant is well prepared and experienced to handle the crowd and orders. We took the 5:30-7:30pm slot and booked a day in advance.We are very satisfied with our 6 plates of mixed sashimi order. We asked for a 4 person serving even though it's just me n my hubby. Other things that we ordered was less than satisfactory e.g tempura, sushi and maki.We would be back again for our sashimi cravings
4
Eaten there 3 times. Reservations are a must as the restaurant is always full. Its our favourite place to satisfy our japanese food cravings. The sashimi is always very fresh. Tempuras are great too. There are about 50 plus items on the menu excluding a range of appetizers
4
Must plan and make booking couple of days ahead even for weekdays. It's worth it as the sashimi is excellent. They don't stinge and give you thin slices. The rest of the menu is average but if you idea is to concentrate on sashimi this is the place to go. For the price it's worth it. Sit at the counter facing the chef and you get instant service. What more can you ask for
3
We found this restaurant to be a little below expectations, but perhaps our expectations were too high. The food is good, and the prices reasonable. All in all it is an ok place, but nothing special. What I liked the most was the cozy atmosphere and the homely japanese decor (but only inside the restaurant, cause as soon as you exit, even to go to the toilet, you are in the charmless and impersonal Miramar hotel)
5
Ikoi is one of my top two favorite Japanese restaurants ever! Tey offer an all you can eat option which is in my opinion best choice as you can choose as much as you like from their card. Only beverages is not included. And in case you ordered much to many that you cannot finish they will charge you for it. Which is fair enough in my opnion.And as the staff is vry quick in providing ordered food ts not a problem to order more often instead of all at once. The quality of the sashimi and sushi is excellent, you can taste that its very fresh. Only the place is very crowded (mostly by locals) and therefore a little noisy (it looks as they tried to put as many table in the place as possible), so I would not necessarily recommend it for the first date. But definitively for the second :
2
Not too good but the interior does not seat many and little privacy
3
very good and price reasonable
