Fresh ingredients, authentic tastes and good portions. However, the dining table for 2 is simply too small to hold sharing plates properly.
5
Delightful evening with good service and delicious food.
I tried the lobster with pasta which was very good. Nice atmosphere, relaxed and overall enjoyable.
5
We took a table outside near the swimming pool, with a view over the glorious garden. Our starter of creamy burrata and tomatoes was generous enough to share between us. The racks of lamb were succulent and perfectly cooked. A delicious, nicely served meal
3
the pizza, good, the pasta, so-so, the cost of a meal"ouch".
if im going to have ok then i should pay ok. i guess the top end stuff would have been better, but i dint mix my drinks.....
5
Last visited a year ago, since then this place has really upped its game.
Quality Italian food to rival the best in Italy, had the sausage pasta which was amazing.
5
The food was very good, especially the pasta was wonderful. We really want to vist again. We are so satisfied with their service as well.
5
For our final meal in Singapore we decided to dine on property at The Waterfall. Having pre-dinner drinks at the Origin bar upstairs, they called down and got us reservations. By the time we arrived they had our table set, inclusive of a high-chair for our 2 year old. The server was gracious, solid and helpful in navigating the menu. We got the kids pizza for our little one. For us we shared the eggplant appetizer, a salad, squid ink seafood pasta dish and finished with the profiteroles. Everything was delicious!The Waterfall eatery is well worth a visit and meal
5
Soon and John were absolutely great with their service, very attentive and observant! We were celebrating friends bday and the cake & dessert & drinks were on the house! The food was awesome especially the squid ink pasta and zucchini pasta(?) ambience was great, recommend outdoor seating to enjoy pool view and wind! Would definitely come back agai

A nice restaurant indeed with the option to be outside or inside with the air cond.You also have the choice to eat à la carte or at the buffet, buffet which offers a somptueuse choice of Italian delicacies. The grilled vegetables are excellent.Beyond pizza and pasta you can also have fish or meat.We had the beef sirloin and it was very good, but the quantity was somehow disappointing.Nice selection of sweets, including ice creams.Excellent expresso coffee
4
This is a good Italian place with nice atmosphere just next to the pool and the waterfall. There’s both pizza and pasta - so a great place for kids. And of course ice cream (from an ice cream box). If it was up to our kids we would eat there every day. The service was ok although a bit junior and unexperienced. For example: when we ordered 2 glasses of Amaretto to go with the desserts the waiter brought us two scoopes of Amaretto ice cream..
2
I m regular Shangri la guest and i love the quality and the style but the italian restaurant this year the beginerr was good but now someting wrong the taste is different not good like january.
2
In sorry but this place have nice decoration good service but bad food.
I can feel that the chef here is not Italian May
Be from Malaysia.
The presentation of straccetti manzo with rocket salads was terrible.
The fettuccinewas inside soup of. Tomato.
Better. Forget.
4
Is still nice, cosy, good healthy food choices for a pool restaurant. And a good escape from the new and very unfortunate lobby experience.
5
Made reservation for dinner for 2.
The service was attentive and our favourite was the Caserecci Agnello.
4
the staffs are so kind. The food was fresh and nice. I want to visith with my friends again.
It s really good for worth.
5
It was meant to be get-together among friends but it turned out to be a Birthday surprise for me as friends arranged for the wait staff to bring me a nice piece of cake and sang the birthday song for me. Food was good too! I had a nice piece of sea bass which was fresh, tasty and nicely plated
4
Staff are all very polite and friendly. Some of the newer ones are a bit inattentive and dont pay attention to clearing the tables and topping up of water.This causes the service rating to be 3 in my assessment plus serving the wrong order to the wrong person. This restaurant is excellent otehrwise and my wife and I have recommended it to many friends. top marks to Jodie, Audrey, Adriano and two others whose name I cant rememeber
1
i came to get dinner in singapore last year here same restaurant but the food was much better now the staff told me there is new chef from italy, The presentation is standard nad before was more fine dining and the taste was not attrattive,For sure ill not came any more.To sleep I LOVE Shanglil-la and ill continue to came but not to eat.Thank
5
We love the southern Italian cuisine served here. The seafood stew we ordered for 2 pax made a fantastic meal while our children had a pizza and a pasta aglio olio which they enjoyed very much. The very cozy atmosphere and friendly staff completed the experience
1
i give a try to this place but this is the worst experience i had business meeting with dinner ( vip) customer all went wrong ,service ,selection of wine ,and food really is very far to be 5 star i dont think i will use again this plac
1
I found the manager and the executive chef to be quite cheeky and rude. The food is far to be italian, Quite cheap the environment too. The only thing very expensive is the bill. I would recommend proper italian restaurant instead of hotel restaurants.
4
We enjoyed the evening with the great service staff and ambience. A was perfect except the fish I ordered was little cold when it came to me...
5
great breakfast,lavish spread,healthy to sweet tooth,local to exotics all in one place..cannt ask for better spread
5
The food is fresh and the place mood is peaceful. i want to visit again. The staffs are very kind as well.
5
Every dish that came our way was absolutely delicious! The desserts were tantalizing! The chef's recommendation was spot on!
1
Me and my wife went there two days ago for dinner. After being accommodated inside instead of outside, we have been served bread that was a sponge, cold meat and warm white wine. Horrible! The only thing this restaurant has italian is the name. Never agai
5
I took my wife here for an anniversary dinner. The service was fantastic. The server was cordial and conversational. He was attentive throughout the meal. The food was delicious. The seafood pasta had the most seafood I have ever seen in a pasta dish. The flavor and seasonings were perfect. The server noted it was our anniversary and brought us a rich chocolate cake to celebrate. I would recommend booking a reservation on their website beforehand. Also request the chef to come to your table to make recommendations. The ambience was romantic as well.
1
I wanted to have a change from the noisy The Line buffet restaurant, which nevertheless has very good cuisine. I had to wait for some time at the entrance, asked for a table for one inside or outside and got escorted to the worst possible table for 1 or 2 (either facing the service station or with my back to it but ever closer... some other guests were proposed better tables...), with waiters zooming around and past me, in a very noisy environment. I ordered caponata with mozzarela for starters, pasta and a glass of Amarone. I had to resquest bread and my wine long after being served the caponata, which was sliced far too large btw and made out of a.o. tasteless tomatoes. Pasta was less cooked than al dente, with nothing notable to remember. Only the wine was good. And service was absent, despite the zooming waiters. What a pity
5
With all the marvelous options for food in Singapore, why would someone keep going back to the same place? We did it 4 times. The service was great, the food was 5 star for every meal, and at the end of a busy day, this place was very relaxing. Even when though it is an Italian restaurant, don't just think pasta. I have to watch my carb count, and I easily found items on the menu that were not pasta based. Can't decide which was better...the beef tenderloin with arugula and shaved Parmesan or the branzino sea bass stuffed with tomatoes and topped with chiffonade of veggies. The waitress was especially helpful finding the correct wine for my tastes. A perfect end to each day
4
The Italian food looking over the pool at Shangri La is an easy option especially at the end of a busy day. Food is tasty and a high standard. Service is friendly but non attentive and young staff very little knowledge of the food and zero about the wine. A little more attention and this would make a big difference.
5
Being so far uutside of Europe, this is actually surprisingly authentic. Everything was cooked perfectly, and ingredients in the dishes were not heavily substituted with local alternatives. Service was attentively good. Happy diner!
5
Excellent service from staffs (Jermaine, Jodie, Andrea, Dinesh & Darren) and the lovely restaurant manager, Andreano ! As usual, the food here tastes SUPERB! Thanks to Chef Marco & his team! Thanks for letting us have a great experience here! We will be back again :

Been here several times. I usually choose to write a review AFTER I'd eaten at least twice at any given restaurant--unless the first visit had gone horribly wrong or perfectly well. Never missed to order a pasta dish since they are handmade fresh. We've had their seafood linguine, spaghetti with clams (a few different occasions), and latest cencioni with swordfish. The tuna salad was a refreshing opener. A definite recommendation. We've tried pumpkin & seafood soup; both were delicious. The portions are perfect for me, but may be on the "small" side for those who finish their bowl or laksa at the local hawker centers. There is a consistency that [undeniably] speaks highly for any restaurant
3
I like the Waterfall restaurant for its casual rustic elegance . The Italian menu leans heavily to pastas. However disappointed with standard of food. My seafood soup, & lobster pasta were good average at best. Desserts are standard fare, including tiramisu & gelatoService is patchyPrices are reasonable by Singapore standards.
4
We dined here,celebrating our daughter's birthday. Here they allowed patron to bring own cake- disallowed by many other restaurants.The 3 fresh fish dishes came in good portions. Salads were refreshing and well prepared. We had a very cooked tasty veal cheek which melted in mouth without much chewing.Staff were attentive and helpful. Due large crowd,kitchen had problem to serve on time,so they kept providing bread with tomato freshly pressed to stop us getting hungry. Food came later but were hot,compensating for wait.We liked the warm homely ambience and well behaved patrons. In June,We had buffet lunch which had many strictlywestern only menu. We enjoyed eating here as no kiasu crowd rushing to clean up food which disturbed our appetite.Another advantage is their wide range of wine.For quiet soothing dining both indoors and alfresco, will go back often. Complimentary parking ticket was provided when eating here
5
We had dinner 2 times at The Waterfall and really enjoyed it. The quality of food is excellent. We liked their pizza but also the starters were great. You can either sit inside (which we did) or by the pool as many people (with kids) did. The service was swift, friendly and correct. We will be going back for more next time we're in Singapore
5
Third visit in six months.Love the pizzas, pastas and Parma ham as well as the seafood pot.As my family members are not big eaters, we came only for ala carte than the buffet. Portion is big and we loved the ambience be it seated indoor or outdoor
2
The food is uninspiring and the service is substandard. Went there for a birthday celebration with family. Not only we have to wait very Long for the food but they messed up the birthday cake, served to another table. Even asking for water refill involved 2 or 3 reminders. To TOP off, bill was not cheap. Last time to this restauran
3
My wife and I went to the Waterfall for a birthday meal. The restaurant has quite a nice ambience and the food was pretty decent. But overall we were underwhelmed and wouldn't return.We arrived just before 6pm and that seemed to take the wait staff by surprise. My first impression - they don't want us here. We were offered a choice of two tables and given menus. However, I didn't like the fact that I had to ask for water as this should've been automatic.After about 10 minutes we were given some bread, which has to go down as the most disappointing I've ever eaten in an Italian restaurant. Completely unremarkable cold white bread served with a watery tomato sauce. Ugh! And where was the olive oil? We felt that the starters were only so-so too and overpriced (about $25 each). Thankfully the pasta dishes were much better and we both really enjoyed these. The sauces were authentic and superior to what I could cook at home. As it was my birthday they brought me a slice of cake (nice touch!) which ended the meal on a high.Service was hit and miss. Our main server was friendly (if a bit casual) but some of the other staff were cold. The chef came out to talk to regular patrons but completely ignored us.For a total bill of over $200 I expect better than this Shangri-La!
5
My daughter chose this restaurant for our family to celebrate a special event. The first thing I noticed was the lovely setting with lots of comfortable seating areas indoors and outside. Although our group was seated near a large corporate private party, we could still have a conversation at a normal volume and enjoyed our meal. The homemade pastas and pizzas were delicious and reasonably priced for Singapore, and there were tasty options for the vegan and the vegetarian in our family! The desserts were also a hit, especially the mango sorbet! Looking forward to going back soon
5
Excelent starters salads food bread and at end a salted caramel ice cream . The manager Andreano carbotti makes all difference in this restaurant . I will be back and recommend
5
We enjoyed a couple of meals at this restaurant. Food. Of excellent quality and service quick and friendly. This is a very popular restaurant in the Shangri La hotel.
5
Despite of the location of the restaurant is housed in a 5*hotel, the price is surprisingly the same as many Italian restaurants in town. Food is consistently good and service is superb
5
The flavours of the food are very authentic and the restaurant offers a wide choice of Italian dishes. The service is great especially the lady manage does a great job. Very friendly and efficient.
5
Rita, my wife and Chuo my son (who is a member of the Shangri-la gym) joined us for dinner on 27th May 17. Our favourite are Seafood Pasta, Hawaiian Pizza (pineapple and ham) and Lasagna. We finished with our favourite ice cream (coffee and coconut) and specially brewed coffee.We strongly recommend locals and overseas visitors to taste Chef de Cuisine Marco De Vincentis authentic Italian cuisine. You can also go for their lunch and Sunday brunch buffet. Please make your reservation at (65) 6213 4138 / 6213 4398 to avoid disappointment
5
The food here is just excellent, with a level of service second to none. We were staying on a meal package and requested to eat here all the time as the ambience and quality are just superb.If you are staying at the Shangri-la then this is my preferred option
4
The Manager is Italian and he has brought his flair to his staff who are warm and friendly.There is both indoor and al fresco dining which helps in the tropical heat!2 gal pals came for vino and a little more. The prosecco was refreshing, then sauvignon blanc, closed with limoncelloWe loved the parma ham, burata salad and I had a seafood soup. All good, great service but we were surprised we were the last ones indoors around 10 pm. Al fresco diners were celebrating the new French President Macron and more.....beautiful poolside with breezes, waterfall and green tropical paradise
4
We ate here while staying at the hotel.Very popular,busy and large portions.Starters were delicious - aubergine (sorry can't remember the name) and salad - we both had pizzas for main - lovely base but felt the tomato paste/topping was too rich and the chunks of ham could have been smalle
2
The space is beautiful, offering various "stations" for food: appetizer buffet, soup station, gorgeous dessert display, and an ice cream stand. Food is standard, nothing special at all. Don't expect to be wowed with flavors. Customer service left a lot to be desired. We were there with a private party and our servers were confused, slow, and not very attentive. Not the service you would expect from the Shangri-la. But if you are a guest at the hotel and need convenience, I can see how this place would be an easy place to stop for a bit...like if it was raining outside or if you child was sick in the room
4
A very good "hotel restaurant." The service was outstanding and the meal was good. I had the carbonara and my wife, the gnocchi. The pricing was reasonable except for the S$18.00 salad. Enough for two (if both wish to have salad - I didn't) Only issue that I had was the poor placement of the waiter work stand right out in the middle of everything. I had to stare at it as did others. Silly floor plan
5
Cosy and comfortable. Wide range of Italian food. Good choice of bread, prawns, salads, beef steak, coffee and cakes.
5
I had booked Waterfall Cafe to celebrate our company 20th Anniversary last evening. I can't wait to share my experience and the service of this restaurant to all TripAdvisor readers. The food here is fantastic and service is impeccable. For those who love good Italian food, do not miss this place.The restaurant manager, Mr Andreano Carbotti (of course from Italy)had arranged the food and seating arrangement the way I like. All my guest had given me good compliments of the food and service. I wish to thank Andreano and team for making the evening so memorable for all my guest and friends
3
Went here for a free lunch that came with my spa package. The buffet is...interesting with healthy options for salads or eat alone I guess. There are many options though so I am surprised people eat here. With my package I got a choice of a hot item but only like 4 or 5 choices so I picked the bolognese. It wasn't bad, sort of bland but was filing. The tea was wonderful and the cute packaged tea was a nice touch. The view is nice with waterfall areas all around
1
Dined at Waterfall and ordered 3 main meals. The gnocchi came out first followed by one of 2 sea food pastas - 3rd never arrived!!! We had to follow up for our missing meal and it had obviously not been made!!. We had to follow up a 2nd time and we were finally presented with a dish that had been slapped together. Mistakes do happen but the issue was the arrogance, no apology and poor service ethic. Not what you would expect from the Shangri L
4
Booked through Chope and happy to get the seats near the waterfall as requested. Food was. Nice as usual and Trista was very friendly and attentive. Did not ask me how would I like my veal loin to be cooked though. Overall experience was good. Thanks

We were staying at the Sangri-La Hotel and didn't feel like venturing out to eat, nor were we interested in The Line Buffet, so we thought we'd give the resident Italian Restaurant a chance. Our evening didn't live up to expectations, unfortunately. We should have taken the hint when it took the hostess at least 10 minutes to return to the hostess stand. After being seated, the service seemed to start out well, with several waiters checking on us / taking our orders / refilling our water drinks. All of the food for our party of four was brought out in a timely fashion, except mine, a simple gnocchi with eggplant. My husband and children had finished their respective meals, and the gnocchi was still nowhere in sight. After asking at least 3 different servers and waiting about 30 minutes, it finally came out. Once it came out, the dish needed a bit of salt. One server I flagged down provided salt, but the container was obviously not a salt container, so when I began to shake, the rice inside the container came out instead of salt. I waited another 15 minutes for salt. They did provide some financial compensation, but the service was simply surprising and unacceptable for this caliber hotel. Unfortunately, the poor service overshadowed the evening. And, the food was average - no one had a meal that was spectacular. If this is your only option, I did enjoy the dinner food over the buffet - but if you have it in you, choose to go out
5
I have been there on my holidays and everything was top class. The food was perfect, good presentation and good taste. Mr. Andreano the italian menager was very friendly and very professional.. I wish go back soon again.. well done Waterfall restaurant.
3
Ate there relatively late as plane was delayed so the restaurant is quiet. Service is efficient. Ordered a salad and a pasta. The salad was very good but the pasta which was served on a pan which was supposed to have pesto sauce as one of the main ingredient does appear to have any pesto sauce in it. A convenient place to have a relatively late meal
5
The Waterfall restaurant is a beautiful place to dine in. the staff are very friendly and the food is wonderful. We had a two course meal and everything was delicious.We hope to return one day and would highly recommend going
5
Pleasant setting by the pool. Food was good and reasonably priced; service was excellent. Certainly lives up to the ShangriLa name and standard - would come again
4
My wife and I enjoyed dinner here on two nights whilst staying at the hotel. We both specially enjoyed vegetable soup and lamb cutlets. Good selection of Italian wines both by the glass and bottle. Recommended
4
Pricing was reasonable for a nice ambience Italian restaurant. Great food and wine with very smiley Sandy
5
We had a beautiful Christmas dinner here last night and the festive set menu was very good value at $98++. Every dish was delicious and tasty but a little too salty for me and I felt a dry mouth after the dinner. Service however was impeccable. The service staff were working on a Christmas night but everyone was cheery and greeted every guest joyfully. The Chinese lady restaurant manager was exceptionally chirpy and sweet. She was very observant and asked if the food was ok when she saw that I stopped eating my pasta mid way. The wait staff were all really genuinely concerned about whether all their guests were having a good dinner. They enthusiastically helped us take pictures during dinner and cleared the plates swiftly. Overall a fantastic experience
3
Thumbs up for the smart pricing but frankly the food quality was very average. The pasta portions were generous but really lacked flavours, substance and presentation was dull. The copper pans are simply unnecessary. Soups and Pizza was just OK. The team was polite and attentive once we got their attention. But unfortunately everyone was on default panic mode, probably short handed. We decided not to interrupt them with requests, so that we don't add any further stress to the team. I think it's okay to charge a little bit more, and bring quality ingredients to the table. The valet and the rest of the hotel staffs were great as usual. Ongoing renovation did not hamper any of our experience in the hotel area
5
Staff were very friendly and accommodating. I liked that it was a Sunday and we didn't have a reservation but they managed to give us a nice outside table by the pool. They also made a special pasta for my daughter. I had Pasta Vongole and my husband had some ink-squid pasta with tomato sauce. Both were very good. We enjoyed this Italian restaurant experience
5
Fantastic food - nice spread of cold and hot dishes.Choice of salads was fantastic, good selection of seafood and meat dishes. Pasta with calms and mussels was delicious.Good selection of dessert and an ice cream bar.Nice Sunday lunch and first class service
5
I visited waterfall today for lunch. The service and the food was excellent. Would like to commend Chef Marco for this cooking and Andreano and the rest of his staff(Mirco, Vicky, Soon, Winnie, Dinesh and Vinthia) for his eye for detail and excellent service. Had a great time dining there
4
Great food, all the dishes we tried were fantastic, but even better was the service. They staff did everything they could to accommodate our picky family members. Their black ink seafood pasta was fantastic. Nice casual setting. Worth going to
5
Spent a wonderful afternoon with friends here. Good selection of food, relaxed ambience and best of all, warm service and friendly smiles all round from marvellous staff - a companion dropped her napkin and it was discreetly replaced immediately, the manager (Vickey) swiftly wiped up spilled milk under our table with no fuss - and simply inquired if we were all right - and the Italian pasta Chef was all charm itself. Shangri-La delivers
3
We were meeting some folks at the Shangri-la and needed a quick lunch before meeting them. This quick lunch cost $200 sing for the three of us. I get it that it is a buffet and all - and if you are staying there you might have no other options, but I've been to plenty of buffets that were worth it and this one definitely wasn't. What a waste of money and shamefully overpriced.
5
This is a very good Italian restaurant in the hear of Singapore! We had the best Pasta Bolognase there and would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the city for a delicious, homemade Italian meal.
4
Loved the Seafood Pasta and different salads served at Waterfall. Ambience was cozy and service was excellent. Food was fresh and tasty
5
The service staff were very friendly and the place is clean and cushy.
Food was awesome and price is definitely value for money.
3
Quality of the food seems to have slipped; some of the dishes were quite salty. Service was alright.

5
This is a rather belated review but the quality of the food was such that I feel it's better late than never. Fresh seafood complimented a sauce which, I swear, tasted of Sicilian sunshine all the way in Singapore! And of course the pasta itself would have got Mama's approval :) Bravo to the chef - I look forward to returning.
4
This may be Shangri-la's little secret in Singapore.Cosy Italian restaurant tucked away near the pool .I like the warm and friendly ambience .The bread was good, pasta dishes full of Flavours . My Favourite was our dessert platter .Service was good . Not common for hotel restaurants to throw in free drinks - but they gave us a little hazelnut liquor shot to round off the night !Will return to try their pizzas next time
4
My kind of place....friendly staff with excellent service especially after a long day with hungry teenagers. The burratta and eggplant appetisers were impressive dishes and cleaned up quickly by the hungry crowd. Squid ink pasta was over done and not authentic ink-based. The beef was done properly and presented well. A second simple home made pasta was al dente and a big hit with the kids. Overall, we enjoyed the meal and will make our way back in future.

Last night (2nd of October), we had a reservation at the Waterfall Café. The staff were very polite on our arrival and made us fit in very well. After this everything started going downhill. 1. The waitress who was taking our order didn’t understand a question “ Will the clams be cooked properly?”. After a few attempted in English, my son had to explain it in faltering Mandarin but we were not able to get a proper answer from her. In the end we decided to order something else. 2. The food arrived extremely slowly and at different times. My son’s order was almost the last to arrive after about 40 minutes of waiting. The order at the next table was equally late.  3. The Carbonara was butter based and didn’t feel like one that is made the usual way. When we asked why it tasted like that – the simple answer was that ‘ this is how we cook it’ 4. The Ravioli had the raw pork smell in it and the shell was really hard and had no flavour. We returned this dish as it was inedible.  5. Water was replenished slowly. 6. The bill took at least 20 minutes to get processed due to the Golden Circle points I used. 7. The dessert took a long time as well to arrive  The only highlight of the dinner was the Wine that we ordered which was excellent. The staff was also very polite and tried to make up for the lack of culinary expertise and overall management levels in the restaurant. Being someone who has traveled to various Shangri-La’s across Asia, I am sorry to say that this has got to be the worst dining experience ever. I don’t think this restaurant should be called an Italian restaurant because the food served is below a Singapore coffee shop standard. This was supposed to be a special occasion for my mum but it ended up falling flat and the only memory we have of the night is the unpleasant dining wait time and the substandard food. I really hope someone would like into this and make some serious changes as this tarnishes the good Shangri-La image
4
By chance, I saw its reviews online so I came with a high expectation on the food review. You know the usual that taste buds are all not the same. Yet I must say the Homemade pasta and was really awesome! We ordered no.19 Linguine Seafood Pasta (recommended and told them no mussels and requested for clams instead). Also ordered no.22 - Squid ink spaghetti. I ate everything except the sauce! My first time finishing my pasta! This place is highly recommended should you wish to try a southern Italian food. The homemade pasta's texture is different from elsewhere I had tried.Will come again for its quality n quantity plus Chef really cooked from his heart. :* Staff are busy in their own station yet are attentive n helpful Lastly, Grazie to Chef !
5
Special thanks to all the waterfall team and service staffs. Excellent service from Andreano, Stephanie, Sandy, Jermaine, Andrea, Vicky, Darren, Dinesh, Soon, Jodie, Qing Ting, Winnie, Candice :) Great Dining experience and food was superb!!!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PLACE TO DINE AT.
5
We had dinner in this restaurant on our last night in Singapore. We thought it might be exceptional, and it was! The restaurant specialises in southern Italian cuisine. We sat outside, under the stars, by the pool. It was very romantic. I had the Casarecci Al Ragu D'Agnello, a wonderful lamb, mushroom and pasta dish, brimming with flavours. This was followed by the chef's take on Tiramasu. It was perfect! We washed it down with an Italian red from the extensive wine list. It was all very reasonably priced, and they also have gluten free options if needed
5
We stayed in the shangri la for two weeks and ate here on a number of occasions. The food never failed to disappoint and the service was among the best I have experienced in Singapore. Stephanie who served us on a number of occasions couldn't do enough to help us with our requirements and exemplifies the high standard of quality in this restaurant. Would highly recommend
5
Chef Marco is a master!The dishes are amazingly goods, and for the ones who would be scared; quantities are huge!From starters with parmiggiana to tiramisu passing by pasta, whatever they are with squid ink & langoustines or seafood or lamb, you will enjoy every bites!Once you start going there, you will never stop
5
Great spread with great location and ambiance. Perfect for leisurely family Sunday lunch. The oyster and clams are fresh. Love the freshly whipped up spaghetti The kids love the gelato. Always a lot of fun
5
Waterfalls has a warm, relaxing and friendly environment. The food spread is good and flavourful. Chef Marco was very friendly and I noticed that there were a lot of regular visitors. Chef Marco welcomes every customer warmly.The dessert especially cheese cake and gelato was very good
5
What a find operated by one passionate chef Marco De Vincenyis who's menu brings real Italian flavours to this part of the world at the Shangri-la Hotel in Singapore. From fragrant Olive oil and Balsamic to fresh and flavoursome ingredients from fresh pasta to ideal combinations create a memorable experience. Must tr
5
What a beautiful setting! I'll admit when I walked into the Hotel I thought "this place must be more expensive than I saw online?" But food was amazingly cheap (SG$20-30 for most mains) for the location. A group of 3 were able to talk business in peace and quiet. Very friendly and attentive staff. The food, wow, all of us really enjoy the Italian dishes that were bursting with fresh ingredients and amazing flavours! Best pasta I've had out
5
If anyone has read any of my past reviews of Italian restaurants you would be aware that as a Chef, master chocolatier I can be very super critical. I find it very difficult as you are always comparing, is it as good? is it authentic? My wife and I were fortunate to dine at the waterfall restaraunt ( one of many restaraunts available at the Shangri La ) last evening and I must say that it met with both our approvals. We both chose simple authentic dishes, San Danielli prosciutto melon for my wife and I enjoyed mozzarella di bufala with caponata. Both dishes were excellent.For our mains we decided on pasta (hey I am Italian what other dish would I choose ) seafood l'inguini and fusilli alla carbonara. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the dish, it was beautifully presented, a very nice portion of fresh seafood and pasta cooked perfectly al dente. For me I enjoyed the creaminess and richness of the carbonara, again this dish is as authentic as it gets.Instead of desert I chose to have an Italian lemon and strawberry sorbet, refreshing tangy and a very nice way to finish off a wonderful evening. I can highly recommend this Italian restaurant
4
Ate at this restaurant on several occasions during our week long stay at Shangri-La hotel and found it to be comfortable and relaxing in a lovely setting by the pool.Breakfast is much better than the Line restaurant as it is quiet and not so many people all trying to get to the buffet. Service is good most of the time and the food is delicious. The dinner menu offers Italian food at its best with pasta, pizza and tender steaks so well cooked. It was our choice for dinner most nights and will definitely return again.The hotel just needs to ensure the service is consistent
4
A very nicely decorated restaurant with a casual luxury feel in a wonderful seething by the pool at the Shangri La. The food was excellent and served very efficiently and unobtrusively by staff who know what they are doing. Good quality wine list.

The food at this restaurant was an absolute delight. The ravioli and pizza were better than anything I had sampled in Italy. Reasonable pricing along with great food - what more could you ask for?

Part of the Shangri-La Hotel this restaurant is really good - we ate two dinners there during our 6 days in the hotel. Menu is extensive and the quality of the food is excellent. Reasonably priced, apart from wine and other alcohol which is expensive, but that is no different from any other place in Singapore! Service is good, with friendly and attentive staff

We have been here before when "The Line" was full one Sunday. The first experience was good enough to get us back again, which is always the best test for us. Excellent spread and pretty good service. Pastries are delicious and coffee excellent. Breads and cold cuts also very good. Tends to be quieter for breakfast than a lot of places as it is a bit hidden in the hotel and not so well known. Next we plan to go for dinner although the dinner menu is not as attractive as it might be. No chicken dishes and the presentation of the pictures is rather dark and red tones dominate.

I am found of Italian cuisine and since I was staying in the hotel I decided to try The Waterfall. Upon showing at the door there was no one to greet or to seat me despite having a stand. So I showed myself in and only then the person who was supposed to be at the stand showed up. When I asked for a table for one it took her almost five minutes in such small place to realize that there were no tables available. She offered to seat me outside which I didn't mind. She brought the menu and took my drink order and went. I went through the menu, made my choice, kept the menu on the table and waited. For almost 15 m no one came. So I started showing my hand to the different waiters who obviously saw me but no one came to take the order. The irony was that the manager was walking around doing nothing. After another 15 m I stood up and left. At that point a waiter came to say "thank you sir for coming"!!! Service is a main element of a restaurant and if it fails service it cannot succeed on food

Set in a nice decor near the swimming pool in the gardens of the Shangri-La hotel Singapore, the Waterfall serves an authentic Italian cuisine at an affordable price. There are 5-6 antipasti dishes to choose from, 5-6 main courses, of course the classic pizza and pasta dishes and a few desserts. All are prepared with the freshest of ingredients. The sauces are nicely balanced, light and tasty without that overwhelming use of cream as in some places. Prices of dishes vary between 28 and 50 S$, less for desserts of course. A 3 course meal would cost you around 100 S$. Their tiramisu is delightful as the mascarpone is mixed with a light whipped cream that turns this Italian classic into a nice light mousse type dessert. Service is attentive yet discreet

We had indicated on our booking that we wished to have a more private table as we were to celebrate our wedding anniversary at the restaurant. The staff took note of our request and made sure we were seated away from the main crowd. Jermaine, a fantastic young man, attended to our every needs and even recommended a pairing of wine for our main course. His wonderful service really made our special day even more special! I would highly recommend the restaurant for its good food and wonderful service
4
The Waterfall was a combination of great ambience and good food. Service was extremely patchy. It was difficult to get a server's attention despite being seated in the centre of the restaurant. Little attention to detail - water (cold and warm) were mixed up; items ordered (and billed) were not sent to table.Starters: Skip the burrata. Go for the baked eggplant.Mains: Seafood pasta was great, as with the sea bream. Disappointing pizza.Desserts: Nothing special - and we had the taster platter that featured four of the desserts
5
Despite a busy Saturday lunch, the service of the staff is outstanding. They are attentive to our needs. When they notice our ala carte order is coming later than usual, they offer us more breads.The ambience and quality of the food is great. It's definitely authentic Italian food. A matter to improve on would be we wish the food could be warmer
3
Service detracted from some great food from fish, to pasta, to lamb to prawns. The desserts were to die for We were first greeted by our hostess and server and accommodated with drinks and complimentary bread. After our order was submitted, it seems our waitress forgot about us. minor incident with not getting one of the orders correct. It took a while to fix. We finally flagged down a manager to fix what we were not getting - which was service. another waiter at different tables did a better job than the one we were assigned. didn't see her the rest of the night? Would recommend it for the great food. Based on what I saw happening at other tables, I think the poor service was an anomaly for this restaurant. The manager did offer us complementary lemon cello home made. The food I would rate a 5
4
Not as good as Shang Palace. Service was quite poor on the evening we went, it was our last night in Singapore, the quality of service wasn't what we expected.
5
Highly recommended by the hotel staff. We hadn't noticed it at the side of the pool but it offers inside and poolside seating with very good Italian food and knowledgeable waiters.
5
love this place ! food and wine list is excellent Try and grab a table outside as inside the restaurant is freezing.. highly recommend the
Linguine Allo Scoglio !
5
Some of the most amazing Italinan we have ever had. Ate there three times in 5 days !!!! Bolognese was a stand out...
5
Although we were told the restaurant was full we decided to give it a try and they managed to fit us in
The food was terrific, a delicious pizza and lovely sea bass
The atmosphere was good, the service attentive and we thoroughly enjoyed it
5
I have come to expect service excellence from Shangri-la. This visit is different in that Shangri-la has exceeded the high standard that has been associated with it. The staff was attentive yet unobtrusive. The seafood was fresh succulent and tasty. This is my 4th visit to the Waterfall Cafe and worth the repeat visit. I would certainly keep coming back.
4
Private party for a special birthday. Nice setting, squid salad was nicely balanced. Both pasta selections were fine, squid ink pasta could have been a little warmer but was good. Baked eggplant very cheesy but outstanding. Grilled seafood nicely presented, florentine steak was well cooked and excellent. Profiteroles was the only mild disappointment. Small n chocolate sauce was a little too starchy. Excellent service throughout, well worth the visit n great occasion.

We have visited Singapore many times and never had a fantastic dinner. We chose the Waterfall as we were staying one night at the Shangri La, the menu looked interesting.We dressed for dinner yet most other diners wore shorts and flip flops, even used there lap tops during dinner.My starter was the chick pea and leek souffle with pesto dressing, and parmesan crisp which I found quite flavoursome.The main course was overcooked chicken with very little jus.The service was worse than the main course , non existent, bordering on rudeness
5
We had a wonderful experience dining at the Waterfall. The ambience was fantastic and the staff were friendly and attentive. The parmigiana melanzan was a nice entrÃ©e. We each had a serving of pasta and the handmade pasta and sauce was great. The angello arrosto was a nice lamb platter to go with. We really enjoyed ourselves very much. Will recommend this place.
4
My husband and I was looking for a light meal. We stop by the waterfall and was given a seat outdoors for dinner but as there was another table near by which as diners there are smoking, I request to be transferred indoor. The staff were very nice and assisted me despite the full crowd. We ordered a crustacean soup which was delicious. It contained prawns and scallops which I found really fresh. The complimentary bread was also super yummy. After the soup, we had Cabonara fusilli which was quite good too. We finished everything despite being not very hungry. I would recommend this place for families and friends. Total cost is a about S$40.

Great food. Great place - tucked somewhere at the back of Shangrila. Wish their menu had more options. Also wish they had more than 3 staff members working.

I was glad that I had chosen to celebrate my anniversary at The Waterfall on 11th March for lunch. The restaurant has a lovely ambiance which my family made good use of to enjoy a good book and drink after our meal. We were pleasantly surprised by a waiter's (named Reuben) outstanding service who made us feel so welcome with his attentiveness. He was observant to see what we need and took the initiative to cater to our needs without us asking for anything. He also came over to our table to specially wish us a Happy Anniversary and chatted a while with us which won us over with his personal touch. He was very sincere in looking into every detail to ensure our celebration was great. We enjoy his cheerful and warm service-oriented personality.I believe he had made a difference to our experience at the restaurant and would like to express our appreciation for him. My husband and I were really impressed and had an extremely enjoyable and memorable celebration which we cherish very much as it is not often that we can dine together as a family due to my husband's busy schedule. Quality of food was excellent at reasonable prices so we are looking forward to going back soon and hope to celebrate other special occasions there too. The cake is especially yummy

Staying at the Shangri La made this restaurant a great option on a slightly rainy night and, thankfully our outside table wasnâ€™t affected.We were promptly given large-sized menus and our bottle of still water whilst we perused the large option of dishes. It was good to see such a variety available for me, a pescatarian and even some vegan options. We thn sat back with a glass of prosecco and watched life moving around the pool area.Both the service and the food were excellent. Our shared starter of Burrata Pugliese Pomodori Marinati was excellent. I then had the baked red snapper (Pargo Rosso con Cime di Rapae Salsa alle Acciughe) whilst my husband enjoyed his wonderfully presented, and tasteful, Tagliata di Manzo Rucola e Grana and I also tucked into his sides of very tasty potatoes.An excellent dining option and recommended.Only slight downside is that the pool cleaning pump was set up just by the dining area and ran for a while at the start of our meal
3
We were warmly greeted at the front door by an enthusiastic young girl who called the manager out to seat us. He promptly did so in an all too efficient manner and left. This set the scene for the rest of the night. We ordered two distinctly different pasta dishes but they came out with the same sauce. Average service with average food and typically an above average bill. I would expect more from a restaurant at a five star hotel
5
We were 2 of us - returning from an event around 7 pm. We were hungry and I happened to remember a friend speaking highly about this restaurant in Hotel Shangri-La - also mentioning that it had excellent Vegetarian and some Vegan choices as well.This restaurant is set amidst 15 Acres of Greenery in the level 1 of Garden Wing of the Hotel. I am certain - given the location - that it also must be very pleasant to have lunch here; when perhaps one can enjoy the lush green surroundings in natural light. However, the weather in Singapore can be very hot and muggy at times and being one of these days; we craved an Air-Conditioned inside seating.We landed up without a reservation - however being a working day - it was not so crowded and we were ushered inside in the Air-Conditioned area - to a table for 2 - which had a very comfortable sofa type sitting with a table high enough to enjoy the meal. The cushion that I rested on was comfortably firm and was a sign that it was going to be a good evening.The complimentary fresh bread served with the tomato sauce was warm and melt-in-the-mouth tender and the Black and White Sesame Studded Crackling Lavash was worth an encore and the waiter very graciously brought us another helping!We ordered a speciality titled "Burrata Pugliese Pomodori Marinati" Per the restaurant's menu - "Burrata is considered one of the most delicious specialities of dairy production in Andria. Creamy stretched curd cheese is mixed with marinated tomato, basil sauce and pistachio for a delightful crowd-pleaser".This was indeed very good and was perfectly contrasted by a piping hot Margherita Pizza - a pizza resembling the colors of the Italian flag, red (tomato), white (mozzarella) and green (basil).Paired perfectly with a Glass of Chilled White Pinot Grigio - the dinner was both satisfying and delicious.We were so full - we could not order the tempting Tiramisu on the menuThe Service was excellent too!!A Very Satisfying Evening - Thank you

Epicurean delight. Authentic classics from food to music and space design. We are locals who do not live in Singapore. A family with a young child and a passion for Italian dining. We absolutely adore Chef Marco's restaurant. It's an Italian oasis nestled in the city center. The property is unique, with resort style, an open terrace to the poolside. Smart-casual yet slick setting, you'll want to throw yourself back and relax with a glass of red wine. The ambience is mesmerizing. Cozy, light and easy. Oh FOOD....! Italian cooking is all about fresh ingredients and traditional recipes, and at this restaurant, it includes great techniques that seal the tastes. Lovely mix of fresh finds, herbs and traditional menu. Healthier replacements are also considered here. For instance, its heavenly carbonara is without cream, you will enjoy your pasta for longer without finding it dry and thickened half-way through the meal. Try the grilled beef in sliced cuts, with a flavorful bed of capsicum and rucola with parmesan. You will never forget the taste. Pick anything on the menu, end the dinner with home-made limoncello. The menu has a great variety of choices for adults and children. It is a perfectly relaxing environment and a safe place for kids who can't sit through the entire dinner. There's a little pond by the restaurant for fish viewing, and if you are lucky (as it's running wild), your little one can also feed the squirrel! (for real). It's becoming our favourite pet in the hotel. And by the way, service team is EXCELLENT here

We had a lovely meal on a VERY rainy night seating outside ! Price for 5 was a bit lumpy but if you eat in a 5 star hotel expect 5 star prices ! Service for the food was very poor - some of us finished meals before the others had theirs even served
1
This was my first meal in Singapore and its a good job I've managed to forget about it!Avoid avoid AVOID!If this was a 3 star hotel the service would be bad. In a five star one, especially one with the reputation of the Shang gri-la, it is utterly unacceptable. Had it not been a business meal, and I needed to avoid a scene, I would have have insisted on speaking to the manager and refusing to pay. It really was that bad.We weren't acknowledged on arrival. We had to ask for menus and even then they took 4-5 minutes. Everything was painfully slow, eg the meals were brought out one at a time then a 7-8minute gap before the last meal appeared. Which had to be asked for.To cap it all I asked the manager for the bill, which he didn't bring or ask anyone else to deal with. I had to ask AGAIN 10 minutes later.To the hotel: this was Friday 19 Feb at 9pm. You have serious staff training issues, please focus on "don't wander round the restaurant doing nothing, think how you can put the customer first at all times"To everyone else: don't come here. Ever

There was a time when the best restaurants in Singapore were in the hotels. I sense that has changed and in fact the best Italian/western food in Singapore is now in stand alone restaurants , typically owner /chef managed. A recent average experience at 190 at the Four Seasons, followed by this poor meal at the Waterfall Cafe, certainly starts to validate that theory. Imagine,Friday night, understaffed restaurant, waiters who don't know the difference between a red wine and a white wine glass, food that arrives for a table of 4 pax , 2 pax at a time, under seasoned food, horrible desserts that do not resemble the menu and you have the waterfall Cafe experience. The nail for this restaurant was the "missing "manager, when we asked to see one. A sous chef who turns up and gets defensive , then proceeds to tell us that he is a simple chef from S Italy and perhaps the experience will not satisfy global travellers. Perhaps the Shangri la is either reinventing its F+B as a simple country experience not suitable for global travellers or the chef at the Waterfall ended up in the wrong place

Kudos to Andreano, Sandy and team for being superb hosts for my company (Amex) year end dinner back in Dec 2015. The team was very accommodating and meticulous in planning the event within the tight turnaround of 2 days. All details were given full attention..ranging from venue decoration to ambient lighting.. even down to the fine details of wine selection where Andreano recommended wines that would complement the food served. Marco the chef...did an excellent job serving up hearty Italian cuisine.Service was amazing, the staff paid full attention to our needs and really made a difference to the whole experience. The above views are purely my own personal views and opinions , and yes I would be back with my family and friends at the Waterfall very soon
5
Great food, cooked well, great ambiance. Pasta cooked to perfection, sauces tastefully balanced, beef grilled to perfection. An enjoyable night out with good food and company. The restaurant even gave us extra dessert, it was a nice touch to end the night.
5
Had lunch here and the pasta was wonderful. The staff were all friendly and attentive and prepared to offer suggestions and recommendations. We had an extremely relaxing and enjoyable lunch. Would recommend.
4
We enjoyed our dinner at The Waterfall restaurant recently. The food was all very tasty and the service was excellent. Would definitely recommend!
4
Only had a late buffet lunch here but presentation, service and food were excellent. Highly recommended
4
I love Asian style food and I ate tons of it on my trip. At one meal, though, I needed a break from its flavors and ended up eating several meals at this restaurant. I was impressed by the quality ingredients, preparation and service.This is probably the best restaurant in the hotel
4
The Mediterranean buffet spread can be had three ways- just antipasti, antipasti with cold cuts, or antipasti, cold cuts and main course. Service is outstanding. The restaurant is located pool-side and the pool/garden view refreshes. The lay-out of tables make one feel relaxed as if in a familiar clubhouse. A favourite
3
The food here would get a very good rating if it were not for the cost. Its tempting to explain away the prices based on everything being imported, but you can get very good food elsewhere for much less. Its still a good place, but you are paying a lot for the premium of not leaving the hotel
4
This restaurant is in the Shangri-la hotel and we ate here several evenings. All the dishes were delicious whether pizza, house salads, soups, pasta or secondi. Many and varied flavours drawing from across Italy. Highly recommend f you are looking for a break from delicious Asian cuisine.
3
It's an OK Italian. Pasta not quite Al dentÃ© and the sauces do not have the depth of the real thing but it's OK Agree with other users that the staff are lovely but very shirt staffed
5
Since they updated the menu around 3Q 2015, this is one of my favourite restaurants in SG. Decent menu choices, great food and wine, Shangri La service and all for a very affordable price. You really cannot go wrong
4
Ate here with colleagues and we had a lunch set menu of anti pasti and a main dish with espresso. The food was really great Mediterranean style and very fresh. Loved it. Fish for a main course.p was delicate and tender.
5
Excellent food & service. Amazing ambiance. Darren & Reuben were just fabulous. Would definitely come back again.
4
The food is fantastic. I love the pizza. Although it was little confusing start when trying to get a table, it turned out to be a wonderful dinner experience. Dolci needs to be further improved.
Herman, the manager, is extremely nice and friendly.
4
Things have changed at The Waterfall with a new menu with coherent Italian theme and evident good leadership in the kitchen. Nice food choice, unconventional serving setting in the kitchen itself, most staff on-message (not quite all). Highly recommended.
4
The Waterfall has very attentive staff and a delicious spread (plus made to order egg dishes) for breakfast, and a wonderful Italian inspired menu for supper. They offer gluten-free bread and pasta, too, which is wonderful for those of us who allergic to wheat. Their beef tenderloin is so tender and delicious, and the pasta tossed with oil, garlic, and parsley is light and cooked just right. We've eaten these things multiple times now. I found the bolognese sauce to be a little greasy so I don't think I'd order that again. The wait staff is charming. They have given us free drinks and free dessert for our anniversary. They are polite and jovial and very helpful with suggestions. It does take some time to get your check at the end of the meal but not because they are slow but seem to want people to stay around, offering more drinks, and tastes of limoncello and bites of this and that. They are good people and that makes this an outstanding place for Italian food.
5
We had a family dinner here and it was so good that we came back for lunch the next day. At the lunch I had a $20 pasta that was better than I have had anywhere in the world outside of Italy!Wide menu with plenty of options for those with dietary issues (my daughter). Decent wine list that for Singapore was not ridiculously priced.Service was attentive without being pestering
2
We couldn't believe our luck finding an Italian restaurant with such good reviews in our hotel. And the spaghetti vongole was lovely. But there were downsides too. I agree with an earlier reviewer that the restaurant appears understaffed (lots of rushing around). They could only fit us in at 9pm, not a problem, we booked an outside table, but then were given an inside (until we insisted). And then my pizza arrived undercooked; it can only have been a matter of two minutes extra in the oven, but the overwhelming taste was of bread dough. Ok, they took the pizza off the bill, but that's not really the point. The staff were lovely and very attentive (albeit overworked). One last (small) gripe: what's with the oversized menus? They are enormous, mostly to accommodate the photos of the food (I never really trust restaurants who feel the need to photograph their food). You could condense the whole thing down to two sides of A4 in an elegant font...
3
We were here for dinner on a Sunday night. Service was a little slow (it looked as if the restaurant was a little understaffed that night) but there were no major issues. Not everything is good here, unfortunately. What is good - the Hunter Valley beef, lobster soup and the tiramisu. Most pastas were average and one or two were in fact too salty. Perhaps lunch may be a better time for visits, based on the other reviews here. There are certainly better Italian restaurants in Singapore and this was quite a disappointment as we had very high expectations based on reviews here and elsewhere
5
I totally fell in love with this place! Everything was just perfect and there is nothing I can think of to improve on. We showed up without a reservation and without being a hotel guest on a busy Saturday evening. The staff immediately found a nice and intimate table for us. Growing up in an italian family made me always super critical about italian food and wine but this was just superb and exquisite. Apart from that we were receiving the best customer service ever. Especially as a young couple we often get the feeling of not being worthy of the same level of service as older customers - not here. Special thanks to RUBEN! You made our evening with your high level of service. Thank you for looking after us and making this an unforgettable night
5
We just celebrated our Wedding Anniversary here. Fantastic authentic Southern Italian cuisine. Handmade pastas Linguine Allo Scoglio combined with fresh seafood. Marvellous! Resturant manager Andrano seal our evening with a beautiful cake with a candle. Many thanks to the staff and Chef Marco for the excellent service and awesome food. Definitely we will return again. â™¡
5
First time here and will come again. The dishes were all amazing and the chef took the time to come out to chat with us. Next to the pool, so the environment was relaxing and chill... Great wine list too.
5
Stylish Italian food reflecting the manager's love of his home region Puglia. Great wine list too and amazing service. We felt very welcome and would recommend it to everyone. Choose the fusilli carbonara done authentically with vegetable broth and eggs no cream.And the Primitivo is full of spice and the Mediterranean. Simply a great experience
5
I recently had lunch at the Waterfall in the Shangri-La hotel. The atmosphere was warm; it's suitable for a nice family weekend lunch. Service was top notch and food was awesome. I had the buffet as I was too lazy to choose from the a la carte menu. Good buffet spread where I could try a bit of everything. The crab pasta I had was wonderful, freshly made noodles, with a fantastic sauce and lots of crab meat. Yummy. The dessert was excellent; unfortunately, I couldn't eat as much as I would like too
4
This restaurant in the garden pool area of the Shangri La hotel has a calm ambiance. The food was pretty good and I had the lobster tagliatelle. The presentation was stylish in a copper pan. My only small issue was that the dishes and garlic bread came out at slightly different times.
5
This is a beautiful restaurant with fantastic staff. We had the seafood to share $68.00 & wow it was too to much for us. The staff are wonderful & the manager Andeano Carbotti was just " superb ". If you are staying here or just visiting don't miss this fantastic restaurant.
5
I recently ate dinner at the Waterfall in the Shangri-La hotel. The atmosphere and service was top notch. The pasta dish I had was wonderful, freshly made noodles and a fantastic sauce. I had a salad with romaine lettuce and fruit that was one of the best I have had in Singapore and the desserts were out of this world.Definitely recommended 
5
Make sure you don't miss the a la carte breakfast in this nice restaurant. You can also sit by the pool (exterior) or enjoy the beautiful interior of the restaurant. The egg Benedict was super tasty, so as a great selection of fruit juices, cheese, fruits and cold cuts.
5
Stayed 7 nights in shangri la singapore - We were invited by shangri la management to celebrate our 35th wedding anniversary with a dinner in this restaurant. I must say a big thank you to all as it was a great occassion and the food and the service was excellant. well done all at the Waterfall - keep up the good work, we hope to see again on our next visit to Shangri-La

Pleasantly surprised to the menus changes at The Waterfalll Restaurant at the Shangri La. We holiday at the hotel each year and it has always been annoying that the dining experience options were either buffet foodhall or v fancy. On previous visits The Waterall was always good but in the evening the dining experience was a bit fancy and the menu didn't gear well to kids. Well that's changed. The restaurant is still smart so you can still dress up but the new menu now means you can be smart casual and take the kids and the food prices seem to match this too. The choices are more kid friendly as well. So now there is more dining experience choices for the Shangri La. Well done. My only suggestion would be a couple of lighter options on the menu. I tired the Ravioli and the soup, but a more interesting salad and a fish dish without lots of sauce would be nice. Still great though. STAFF are really lovely too
5
two of us first time visit . nice service staffs are very attentive . And the food fantastic . If you are fresh pasta lover or seafood lover must try . we were not sure what to order , restaurant manager recommend seafood stew (Stufato di Pesce) , its good enough for 4 pax . The restaurant manager recommend to us red wine from Puglia(a region in Southern Italy) where he from , would love to have it again . The manager really helpful and good food 
4
Lovely atmosphere and very tasty food, great selection, however we found it quite expensive, compared to other restaurants in the city area.
5
We ate here on our first night after a long flight from the UK and the staff were very friendly, especially with our tiered and slightly grumpy three year old.
5
Visited the restaurant whilst staying at the Shangri La. Excellent service from staff. Food was well cooked and tasty. Would visit again.
5
Wonderful Italian cuisine in the heart of the Shangri-La Hotel. Exceptional personal service and well-prepared pasta (among other things).
4
Had a lovely dinner with my wife and it did feel like we were at the base of a waterfall. The staff were efficient without being intrusive. The wine list was great and we tried the rose. Great wine. The food was excellent. I had the lobster linguini and my wife the lamb ragout. In short a Mediterranean getaway in the heart of Singapore and highly recommended.
5
5 of us were given the opportunity for a lunch at this Italian restaurant as a farewell lunch for 2 of our colleagues. This was our first visit to Waterfall despite numerous visits to other restaurants within Shangri-la Singapore. To our surprise, the reception, new restaurant manager and all staffs are very attentive to every minor details throughout our 2 hours dining. The speed of the service is excellent. An unforgettable food quality and environment. The ambiance was delightfully calm and quiet despite almost full capacity. An absolute enjoyment to dine. We would like to thank Joshua Navin (Assistant Director F&B) for this great experience. We'll be back! From Mr Lim C

No complaints on the food an ambience - quite lovely in all aspects. Special mention to the absolutely divine cheesecake. However the quality of the service really wasn't commensurate to the pricing and atmosphere of the restaurant. Service staff didn't know where the nursing room was, and one did not open the door for me for a few minutes when I was holding my child because he was busy talking to another service staff. The general feel of the service I got was that the restaurant has no point of view on how to make customers enjoy their experience service-wise, and that the staff were hired part-timers and was provided no training. Hope they can rectify this to be a amazing restaurant

Myself and my Husband had a 4 week holiday in Austalia travelling the Gold Coast and Hamilton Island. We stayed at the Shangrila for 2 nights as a stopover on our journey home to the UK. On our last evening we decided to eat at the Waterfall , which serves authentic Italian food. This must be one of the best Italian restaurants outside of Italy. I had a salad as a starter with crab and orange, delicious. For my main course I had the ravioli, and I must say that it is the BEST I have ever had. I could tell that it was made with a passion that only the Italians can do, and I paid my compliments to the chef (very handsome). The atmosphere was "buzzing" and the staff were attentive. Our dining experience was very pleasurable, a wonderful end to our holiday. Keep up the good work ..

This is a big top-end hotel's attempt to create a characterful corner with some "ambience" - an aim that it more or less misses completely. The result, a comfortable, but anonymous low-ceilinged poolside eatery (the eponymous waterfall, its splash pool full of iridescent, but uneatable koi, is out of sight round a corner). The mid-sized menu claims to be Sicilian home cooking - the way that Mama used to make it - though I am sure Mama never made crispy lasagne nests, or served New York strip steaks sliced up like a chateaubriand, half-drowned in oil and chopped pimento. I have to avoid most carbs, so pizzas and paste are more or less off limits: the menu has a few pleasant surprises: a well-chilled burrata on a bed of sweet cherry tomatoes, a generous serving of a mixed seafood salad, along the lines of a ceviche, the sliced-up steaks previously mentioned (ask the chef to leave off the salad garnish and the extra oil, and opt instead for a plain tomato salad dressed at the table). Little roasted pork ribs (porchetta) are tasty and tender. The fish of the day is exceptional value and is beautifully grilled: red snapper is outstanding when it's available. Finish with a sorbet, said to be made in the kitchen. The short wine list has a few genuine Italian offerings, not always available: try the Greco del Tufo, flinty, muscular, with a bright clean dryness from the volcanic soils its grapes prefer

Had dinner here on the last night of our holiday in the Far East and had planned for it to be very special. Our table was booked for 9pm and after dinner we were heading for the airport and our flight home.When we arrived, about 10 minutes early, the table was not ready which was not an issue however the staff did not know how to cope with us and asked us to wait outside in 30 degree heat which we declined to do. A table was then hurriedly made available and then we waited and waited. Finally we were offered menus and drinks.We then ordered two starters and 4 main dishes and asked for the starters to come first and for all the mains including for the children to come together. This never happened and two mains for the kids arrived and nothing else. We waited and finally the starters arrived but by this time I had finished my drink but there was no attempt to get me another.the mains then arrived by which time two of the party had finished. It was a mess and it was clear that even at 9pm with almost no one there, they were struggling to cope.I spoke to the maitre'd who took over and provided personalised and friendly service and who then went about rescuing us from what could have been a disasterous last night.The food was very good and I can recommend the Wagyu beef. I would make the comment that the food was always just warm and never hot and the same for the coffee.On the basis that the food was good and the service recovery excellent, I rate The Waterfall as very good but they do need to be the service right as well as the foo

Chillies for breakfast - what more can you want! Oh well ok curry, fruit, egg, bacon, dim sum, miso, fruits, cereal and more - Fab!

Went with my wife here a couple of times - never disappointed. Food is always of high quality, although the menu maybe lacks a bit of panache: it is all rather predictable. Wine menu is good, for my personal taste not enough heavy Spanish reds which go so well with Italian food, but this is just personal preference. Staff is attentive and polite. However, every time we are there I see the same thing: it takes them long to come for your first drinks or aperitif, but they don't leave you enough time and peace with the menu. Maybe a topic for some training? All-in-all, a good place and one of the best Italian kitchens in town

The Waterfall offers a range of high quality and authentic Italian dishes courtesy of the recently appointed Italian head chef. The Lobster Pasta I had was generous and had perfectly cooked pasta. Dishes range from around $18 for a spaghetti bolognese up to the $40 range for meat dishes. Service is excellent and wine list a good mix of wines
5
We really liked The Waterfall for its relaxed atmosphere. The food was wonderful....I had the Australian beef tenderloin and savoured every mouthful. The pasta was made fresh and the tomato sauce (the children's requirements) was delicious, with just the right amount of garlic. The pizza was nice too. The food came promptly but there was a bit of confusion with the drinks, so took a little bit longer to get them, but the wait staff were very apologetic and gracious and made a good service recovery. Other than that, I cannot fault it and will be back.

We visited this restaurant twice and both times the food was excellent (even though the catch of the day never changes from Salmon!!) however the service was incredibly slow, staff seemed confused, walked around in circles a lot & couldn't answer basic questions regarding the menu. The 3 stars is pure,y for the food alone which saved the da
3
Had lunch here after checking in.Burrata starter was good but my wife's pasta dish was poor and my " lasagne" dish was just terrible. The lasagne dish was deconstructed style....what was termed "croquette" style. Basically, a huge piece of pasta/lasagne folded into a parcel shape with a minuscule amount of tomato/Ragu sauce in the middle but swimming in a lake of bechamel sauce. It just didn't work! The inside was slightly watery and the outside too crispy and there was no flavor of any note.What I found most annoying of all were the pool boys who were literally running in and out of the restaurant getting drinks for people sitting by the pool nearby. It contributed to a very rushed and unholiday like feeling. Whilst having lunch, the man sitting next to us sent back his iced coffee and the following morning I overheard two other gentleman complain that there cappuccinos were cold, so I know I was not alone in my disappointment
5
It was one of those nights, where you look at each other and say: " I can't face those crowds again, and the heat"! So we chose to eat in-house, and were not disappointed! Beautiful Southern Italian food served with style, friendly staff, and delicious as well
3
We have gone to this restaurant twice in the last week and I have to say that the food is absolutely lovely (even if the 'catch of the day' is always salmon!) - though the service could do with improvement. The waiting staff didn't even know what goes into the tomato sauce that comes with the bread! On the first night, it also took in excess of 40 minutes to order a dessert - even though the staff seemed to only be walking around part-clearing other tables... Shame really. It's the food that's given this restaurant 3 stars

My daughter and I are staying at the shangri La apartments for 10 days, this was our first visit to the restaurant. My daughter and I ate here tonight, she has not been well, so it was nice to see her enjoying her meal. I did not mention about my meal until after she had eaten and I was asked by the manager how it was and told him the sauce had split, it was very oily and curdled. His response was that the usual Chef was not on duty and that it was a Chinese member of staff cooking. The manager did offer us dessert, which we did not want, but I did feel he should have compensated us in some way. We did like the restaurant, so maybe just a bad experience for us
5
We enjoyed breakfast lunch and dinner at this friendly, welcoming Mediterranean restaurant in the hotel grounds. We preferred this to the busy buffet restaurant in the ground floor of the hotel. The eggs Benedict at breakfast were good. The fresh berry croissants were beautiful to look at but the presence of a few fruit flies put me off unfortunately. This was a shame because the quality of the food was excellent at all times.Dinner was always excellent but I would recommend sitting inside away from possible Mosquitos in the garden where I was bitten once. I regretted not covering up more.The lunch buffet was excellent but I was a little confused over how many courses were allowed. When I wanted a desert from the cabinet I was told this was most certainly not included in the option I had chosen. I think this should have been made more clear to avoid embarrassment.All in all the restaurant was excellent and we were delighted with the food on offer
4
After spending time in Italy I was pleasantly surprised by the food. Very authentic Italian. I had a great meal at a reasonable price. Service was excellent.
3
Had lunch buffet at ‘The Waterfall’ restaurant. It was Italian buffet. I would say it was not the best Italian buffet we ever had in terms of number of items. But, it’s not bad either. Good quality food. Good amount of salads to choose from. 3-4 pasta sauces option at pasta station. Some appetizers and desserts. Though, number of items were less for the price we paid. Quality and taste of food was good. Staff, was not that attentive as compared to other restaurants at 'Shangri la'
5
My family and I have been to The Waterfall cafe a few times! The food there is amazing and the service is good. We were sitting on a table outside and I noticed some ants so they helped us get a table indoors and even compensated by providing us with free ice cream sorbets! Now that's what I meet by they take care of their guests well. The food is amazing with good choice for vegetarians! I would totally recommend this restaurant to everyone. It's my new favourite Italian restaurant
3
Main courses arrived nearly 10 minutes apart, was offered a free dessert when I asked he manager why but no apology. Food average, nothing special for the pric
5
My family and I spent our last night at this restaurant. I was not expecting traditional Italian food at restaurant in Singapore, but was pleasantly surprised. The staff catered to our every need and the atmosphere by the pool was relaxing. I would highly recommend it
3
With good food at reasonable prices but sadly the service is poor. We were given a discount off our bill as a result. Im puzzled how the hotel management could continue to isolate the concept of service frm the quality of food served, seemingly after past reviews given on poor service. It appears nothing has been done to improve the situation. In the hospitality sector, holistic customer experience is key. It wld be sad that the management continues to allow shoddy service - such as ignoring orders, discriminative service - compromise the bottomline of the restaurant. Thk you very much for the food discount. But I will not be bck for awhile.
3
I must say the food quality and ambience were good.....befitting of Shangri La status. However, unattentive service really ruined the day. Firstly, we asked for the wine list which never came, until our reminder. Secondly, we ordered a glass of wine....and never came. Thirdly, our glasses of water was never replenished while we noticed 2 other tables next to ours were constantly filled up by the staff.....an example of inconsistent service. To their credit, we were given 25% discount from the bill after we gave feedback. To our horror, when the bill came, they left out the seabass which was to replace an earlier pasta order. Theres no remorse in pointing out the mistake given such service. Further the pasta was cheaper than seabass.....thats costing the restaurant dearly for unattentive and inconsistent service standard. We feedbck to the waiter that the we wld not return and the service charge was totally undeserving! Clearly the poor service was a disservice to the good food served
5
The food and service were a phenomenon! Considering they've only been open for 2-3 months, this is a job very well done! We started with a fresh prawn seafood soup (which wasn't even on the menu yet) as a starter, followed by Stufato di Pesce, a very generous portion of seafood stew enough for two, but there were 3 of us and we added Cassareci al Ragu D'agnelo, which was a gorgeous serving of minced pork sausage pasta tossed in what seems like butter, wine and cheese- TO DIE FOR!Not only was the food great, Chef Marco, came out to greet us which was such a pleasant experience! Finally, we ended the meal with the sharing dessert platter- tiramisu, cannoli (my absolute fav), biancomangare (almond panna cotta) and baba al rum (strawberry cream and pastry). Thank you Pastry Chef Michelle, it was just wonderful
3
Restaurant is obviously under-staff. It was my 2nd day visiting the restaurant and again I encountered unmanned counter, just the same I encountered at The Line two days ago. My fiancé and I walked in and noticed there were only two staff serving around. We were seated and my fiancé ordered some toast and scramble eggs at the egg counter and to his utmost surprised, it took them 20mins to serve. I ordered a English breakfast tea with Ms Sunny that was never served after 30mins until I have to walk up to her to let her know. Ironically, when the supervisor/manager in suit turn up from no where, then suddenly more than 5 staff were seen busy walking up to guests table taking orders/serving/getting them. Although the restaurant was marketed as a la carte breakfast (cook as and when you order), that's no consistent throughout, because when we ordered waffles and pancakes, they were served almost cold, as if it was just taken from the pre-made bunch of waffles/pancakes left on the grille and plated them nicely to be served. Make sure you inform them that you want your food to be served fresh and hot, otherwise you will encounter the same as I do, not a la carte/cook upon ordering. Pastries at buffet line was good esp. almond croissant
4
Was in the mood for an affordable meal later at night after a long day of business, didn't want to leave the property so I settled on the waterfall at the hotel (Shangrila) based on reviews here. I had a great pasta dish (orecchiette with broccolini and sausage). Excellent simple dish served with tasty homemade bread with tomato based and also olive oil dipping sauce. Perfect simple meal without spending the usual fortune in Singapore.
5
Had visited this restaurant once and found it has a good ambiance with good feel. Food is excellent and you get to be near the nature while having your food.
5
We had breakfast every day at the Waterfall
Staff remembered our preferred beverage and was delivered quickly
They even remembered I liked an extra pat of butter
We were not rushed and we enjoyed views of the pool
5
Extremely high quality of service here and a great wine selection. The beef carpaccio was exceptional but all of the food is worthy of note. The staff were attentive without being overbearing, great experience.
4
Daily breakfast was convenient when staying in balcony room where the waterfall may be heard continuously from the living room or at breakfast time;)'Not many change in their menu on main item such as fried rice or noodles. Fried rice kinda balance tasting and needed the Cheff to refill only when asked! Also, did not deliver the eggs when asked perhaps forgotten?Varieties are sufficient as in any other hotel ....ordinary buffet with pool view outdoor seatings if so desired as an alternative option for indoor dining;)'Cheers
4
Decided to have our dinner at The Waterfall instead of buffet at The Line as hubby was still quite full. We did not have any reservation n were told that we had to wait for about an hour. We sat at the waiting area n were quickly served drinks. We appreciate the fast service to help us wait comfortably for our table. Menu shows Classic Italian pasta, pizza etc. Within half an hour, we were led to a table with space for our baby sleeping in his stroller. Restaurant was pretty packed n we had to wait quite a while for our food. Well, I guess good stuff is worth waiting. We ordered pasta n they were delicious! However, the seafood stew was a little disappointing. The prawn, etc were too tough. Tasted more like seafood cooked in tomato base. This dish could have been better. Prices of the dishes were surprisingly cheap compared to italian restaurants elsewhere. Worth gg to for the pasta. Would love to try their pizzas next!
4
Changing the restaurant to Italian is a great choice. We had a business lunch with a buffet and the selection was excellent and the food quality was super. The service was a bit disappointing, polite staff but almost impossible to get into contact with them. Requested water twice and they served juice twice.... As we stayed in the hotel for a week we tried the restaurant again and the food was fantastic but the service poor
3
Was staying at the Shangri-La so ate here a few times. I would probably give it a 3.5 star if that was possible! Wait staff were nice, but the food was just ok - certainly not outstanding. But nice when you are watching your children play in the pool
5
I went there with my family a couple of days ago and had one of the best time I have had in a restaurant in Singapore. The food was great and especially the seafood pasta. Service has been fantastic from the start to finish. The "angmo" manager has been great. We will recommend the places to friends and family.
3
Good food quality and value for money. However, patchy service from the service team - no follow through with requests, indifferent look. Not sure if it was because it was a busy night and they are all overworked. The air condition broke down on us while we were dining and thank goodness it was resolved after 15mins as it was getting really stuffy
3
Attended Sunday brunch. Place has a nice homely feel with several seats also offering pool views. Spread of food was not extensive though. Some hits and misses with regards to food. Pasta live station was good and so was the appetizer section. Cold seafood range was limited. Main dishes to be ordered were generous. But my steak was not done in the way I wanted. Service was not up to mark given the prices charged for the brunch. Had to always call for refills. They seemed a bit understaffed to be able to run the brunch effectively. I would probably go back to give them a chance on the ala carte menu. There are several other brunches that offer better value for the prices charged
5
Good choice on the menu and food quality was very good.Nice decor and staff were good. This restaurant is also used for the buffet breakfast
3
Environment is really nice; food is good. Maybe the number of choices in the menu is a little bit limited in number
5
great sommelier great wines, great food but outstanding ambience! Great Steaks! Indoors in the day is better and outside seating in the evening. feels like you are in a resort which is quiet and peaceful , very relaxing.
5
Had breakfast here during our stay at the hotel.
Good healthy food in a nice atmosphere. Service is little messy and slow, but always smiling and good.
4
A mixed bag of emotions regarding this restaurant.We were given a table facing the swimming pool, which was closed for the evening, so the night view was spectacular, the ambience was great. I don't understand why a previous review said that the menu was limited, personally, I felt that the menu had lots to offer, many dishes that you will not typically find in other Italian restaurants. So it was very refreshing and we had a hard time trying to decide which dish to try, they all sounded so good!The food is impeccable, one of the best I have ever tasted from any Italian restaurant.However, the service needs much improvement. We noticed that the senior staff were way better in terms of service quality but the junior staff were absolutely not up to par. After we were seated, we waited for a long time and finally resorted to asking the staff for a bread basket. Other restaurants usually serve complimentary bread baskets, not sure if this is the practice with this restaurant but we had to ask for it. And when we asked for butter, they said that they do not have butter. We have never encountered a restaurant that does not have butter?The staff also forgot our orders (to their credit, in the end, they served us the ice cream free of charge because of the delay) and when we asked one of the staff what was one of the items on the dessert dish, he didn't know and said he had to check. Which is fine with me, but he said "Wait ah!" and never came back. My husband also found it difficult to get the staff's attention, not sure if they are understaffed? And when we asked for help to clear the table before dessert, it took a very long time and another reminder from my husband before it was finally done.Furthermore, when the bill came, the staff gave us the bill for the neighboring table which was triple our bill cost. Luckily my husband checked the bill!All in all, I will return because of the wonderful food and ambience but I hope the management will look into improving the staff's service etiquette. It was very obvious that the junior staff were not trained well enough and they seemed so unsure of their service etiquette
4
Food first rate. The service was uneven and it was a bit noisy. Every entree and starter were very, very good. They were out of many of the desserts. We were told about family-style service and it worked out fine, though in general, I really prefer to order my own food and eat it (which we could, of course have done anyway and did not, following their lead) sharing of course, but getting to eat my own preference for the meal. Still, we knew and could have adapted and didn't. Great food.
5
We are traveling in Singapore for business, my wife and I decide to visit this restaurant as we are staying at the Shangri-La hotel. The reviews we read from trip advisor were very good.We visited for diner, the ambiance is great and the decor is extremely warm, like an Italian villa. We ordered burrata and melanzana for antipasti, the melanzana was incredible but the burrata was below average. What made up the night was the waiter overhead my wife complaining and told the Italian Chef. He came out and apologized, he explained that the burrata is flown from Puglia region and that sometimes it does not travel well. However he treated us to a gluten free chocolate cake that it's to die for. I highly recommend The Waterfall because the food is great, but the service is out of this world
5
Set beside the expansive pool, The Waterfall serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. Outdoor seating is prime, particularly at breakfast before the sun is too high, and the buffet is a sumptuous array of Eastern and Western offerings. Everything from baked beans and congee, smoked salmon and dumplings and fresh local fruits to sausages and pastries galore! There is also a menu of omelettes and other egg dishes. In short,something for every taste
4
The Singapore Shangri-La has several restaurant venues. We've eaten at them all. My wife and I particularly like the Waterfall for breakfast and lunch. It's a delightful, small oasis. It's particularly pleasant for breakfast and dinner and you can also eat in air-conditioned comfort inside. Good food as in all the S-La restaurants
5
We have been fans of the Waterfall, for its beautiful setting and continental European cuisine. Just a day ago we were delighted to taste a delicious Italian dinner cooked by the newly arrived Chef who offered to prepare something from his native country, versus having us choose from the current menu. The Waterfall will become an Italian restaurant shortly - so check it out and order the spaghetti frutti di mare
3
Nice to eat outside in December, you need to be explicit when ordering breakfast express the wish for toast (only white bread available) or you end up with Rye bread. Coffee, juice and pastry's are good so enjoy
4
We only had pizzas but they were very good and I would not hesitate to return to try other things. The setting outside the restaurant at night by the pool was particularly pleasing. Very helpful staff.
5
Had a great breakfast and even better service. Highly recommended - the juice was lovely. And had great lattes - plus a good pot of tea
4
We enjoyed tasty breakfasts here with friendly, prompt service from the staff. Delicious eggs benedict and tasty freshly cooked omelette. Coffee made to order just right and nice and hot. Good quality English breakfast tea and nice pink guava juice. Nice surroundings either indoor, overlooking side koi pond or outdoor overlooking pool area. We sat indoors which is air conditioned. Very pleasant experience in a nice relaxing setting
4
Lovely food, interesting menu choices, and a very kind and attentive waiter...made for an unforgettable grand finale to a perfect vacation...The Shangri La is so gorgeous at night time (and all the time!) and this was a wonderful place to share a quiet and relaxing meal in blissful surroundings
3
I have eaten here four times (dinner and lunch) and on each occasion had some unfortunate experience. The location and ambience is great. The menu is of modest choice but great imagination in Mediterranian style. The consistent issues arising are variability of staff experience (bringing wrong food to wrong table), keeping food warm (twice it has not been) and cooking food properly (twice not). So I can recommend the experience but some issues persist
5
We first went to Waterfall on a busy weekend brunch, after being totally turned-off by the crowd at the Shangri-La brunch buffet (victim of its success!) Waterfall appeared to us like an oasis: calm, serene, intimate terrace by the pool, and very welcoming staff. But it's the food that really got me there: there was a buffet of truly awesome mediterranean antipastis, made from the highest quality and freshest ingredients: seasonal grilled veggies, expert selection of cold cuts (the prosciutto was outstanding) and cheeses (try the melt-in-your-mouth buffalo burrata, a super-creamy kind of mozzarella), marinated seafoods, skewers of Italian delicacies and much more...all details without exception showed quality: even the olive oil in free service, an organic one from Greece that was incredibly fruity and tasty. You can chose to have either the antipasti buffet alone (trust me, it's really enough and delicious alone!) or the buffet + a main course and dessert. I liked the place so much that I came back for diner, and tried the lobster bisque and cheese platter, which were lovely too. The bread was homemade, warm and delicious. We had to ask more of it. We also had an excellent bottle of rose wine from Provence (my hometown!), which had the particularity to be made and bottled....by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt themselves! Who knew they had their own quality vineyard in South of France!To sum up: if you like to have more intimacy, escape the crowd, avoid over-eating at lavish buffets and sample some exquisite, healthy Italian fares...that's the place to go! Perfect for a romantic diner with your loved one by the pool (book early for the best seats)
5
Whether for a filling western or eastern breakfast, healthy or otherwise, or for dinner this is a true gem hidden away almost within the ShangriLa Hotel.The choices on the menu are varied and exciting. As is the quality of the food. The staff are very attentive though not "in your face" with only brief eye contact needed for any attention needed.Added to all that is the view, you are either looking out over a lush green garden complete with waterfall, or in the other direction is the swimming pool - half hidden by the same lush green undergrowth.A highly recommended restaurant
5
Normally we don't go for European cuisine when visiting Singapore but this time were invited by a resident there for lunch. We were very happily surprised by the overall experience, as the pasta was great, and their selection of Hams and Cheeses suited by palate to a T. In spite of the high temperature, having our lunch al-fresco was very pleasant. We can highly recommend it to potential visitors, not to walk past it without giving it a second and very serious thought
5
For starters, we had the Scallop Carpaccio. Okay, I'm not exaggerating but I truly felt like I just died and went to heaven the moment I had a slice of the scallop. It was HEAVENLY. Thinly sliced scallop which tasted so fresh, light and clean. It was drizzled with orange zest and had bits of capers and orange slices too. To this day, I daydream about this dish and I can't wait to go back for more. I was told that the Chef has specially prepared this dinner's menu for us so sadly the Scallop Carpaccio is no where to be found in their regular menu but for special functions or occasions, I highly recommend that you request for this.More here: http://www.frannywanny.com/2014/07/the-waterfall-at-shangri-la-hotel.htm
4
Lovely breakfast n lunch cafe for alternative choice. Breakfast spread are limited compared to the line though..
5
One of the best place to have breakfast for relaxing atmosphere without realising you are in such a large hotel.
4
Casual chic vibe to the new design of this space. Relaxed atmosphere with partial buffet offerings and a menu listing. Very comfortable with great food.
5
Fantastic fresh juices ,all what you need for breakfast,,fresh exotic fruites,,different kindsof chease and bread ,
5
We booked as a birthday treat on a Thursday afternoon and mentioned it was a birthday celebration. The food was so tasty with a fully stocked antipasti buffet and then a choice of mains. The food was fantastic and at the end the wonderful staff surprised aus all with a birthday cake. Well done Shangri-l
4
I had one dinner in the Waterfall while staying in the Shangri La. My casual dinner was quite nice. I especially remember the gazpacho with mango which was a great combination of a little bit sour and sweet. I sat outside as there are no mosqitoes
5
An excellent place for a very friendly meal with family and friends, and a wonderful place for young lovers.The food, service and ambience are all top class. You can dine either inside or outside and quite close to the pool. Wherein all you need is a warm night a full moon and each other...Highly recommended
5
The cafe is at the Shangri-La hotel. It looks out over the pool area and the soothing sounds of the waterfall nearby take your mind to a state of relaxation as you enjoy a wonderful breakfast. Check out the cups they use for their lattes...very cool indeed and the eggs benny were so good I had them each morning
2
Start off with the drinks - good champagne selection either regular Tattinger for $150 or 2005 vintage for $198. I went with the latter and it was very good, also sampled the herb infused cocktails, Adonis. It was nice but evidently they had forgotten the order as nothing had arrived within the first 30 mins after enquiring 15 mins later the drinks arrived; needless to say I stuck to the champagne thereafter.Food quality was very good, a limited selection , but they definitely employ the quality not quantity concept here. The overall interior and ambience was also good, reminded me of more of a private dining lounge than a restaurant. The table servers were also very attentive, I think the girl who took care of us was called Sandy. Very quick with the champagne and keeping the table clean. So what let it down? Poor management. Towards the latter part of the brunch we were approached and told we we were being too loud. Up until that point we had no interaction with the restaurant manager, had he come over earlier and introduced himself it may have been an easier message to communicate. I truly wonder what sort of training these restaurant managers get. Evidently he had no idea to convey such a message and left us feeling very uncomfortable. We were a very small group and the restaurant was practically empty so I struggle to understand who we offended and honestly we were not that noisy. Additionally I booked online which advertised a 15% discount but, just realized i didn't receive it. Overall a real shame, great ambience, nice live music, good quality of food and beverage but totally incompetent management. Would I go back, no. Sunday champagne brunch is supposed to be a time to let your hair down and relax, unfortunately not so at the Waterfall. A great shame because up until that point i was having a good time. Also interesting to note that none of the reviews here have a response back form the management - either they don't read reviews on tripadvisor or they don't care. Either way poor form form for a major hotel chain
2
I tried to make a reservation after hearing so many good things about The Waterfall however it was made impossible when I called to enquiry about menus and pricing and if they serve a set lunch menu. The lady on the other end hardly spoke any English which was extremely frustrating. I was looking for just some simple details
5
What a lovely addition to the Shangri- La's wonderful restaurants. Food delicious, service friendly and timely, surroundings relaxed. All the ingredients for a very enjoyable meal.
5
The decor is just beautiful and the food is fantastic. We had breakfast there and they cater to all tastes.
5
One of the best hotel dining experiences I have had in recent years. During my 4 night stay I ate all breakfasts, one lunch and 2 dinners here and they were all consistently excellent. Great ambience...simple, unfussy...and amazing quality food using the best ingredients.
4
Lovely steak and good pasta. A good choice for a less
spicy option in singapore. Very pleasant surroundings and helpful efficient staff.
5
Excellent service and attention to detail.Every food wish is catered for and the staff are so attentive
4
Tables are inside and airconditioned or outside in the warm evening air. Menu changed daily, with a Mediterranean touch. Dining is casual but pleasantly done
5
The Waterfall Cafe is a great, relaxed yet very select place. The food iswell prepared and the waiting staff is attentive to all details on the table. Well done to everyone
2
Not much more to say than the people who work here clearly don't care about what they do and it shows...
4
Very original, cozy, classy interior decoration. Delicious food. Efficient and friendly service. Affordable prices. What do you want more in a hotel restaurant?We had the spaghetti with prawns. Special thanks to Joanna for a remarkably personal and friendly service! I do want my Adige white wine next time ... ;-
5
Not sure what other reviewers refer to in speaking of inferior service --- ours was just fine. But, more to the point, the meals I had with two friends were excellent -- appetizer (chilled gazpacho), entree (grouper --- really well prepared!) and dessert (apple crumble with terrific ice cream). Not only that but the setting is just lovely. I'd go back in a heartbeat
4
An oasis of calm compared to the Blu next door which feels like an expensive cantine. Beautiful outdoor setting next to the pool, attentive staff, outstanding cappuccino and a simple but very tasty food choice.
3
Went with kids in evening. Ushered to the foyers table and then basically forgot. An hour between courses. Not great for a young family. (Service looked great elsewhere). Maybe it was because we had kids, or maybe because we weren't resident. Won't be back.
5
A comfortable and relaxed restaurant with a Mediterranean feel. The food and service were excellent. A very good alternative fro breakfast
4
Stunning setting be it breakfast lunch or dinner excellent wines cellar good food pleasant friendly staff full of life and kindness
Perfection in the city
4
Unlike other parts of the hotel, staff here are very attentive and on the ball. Many food choices, beautifully presented and taste great. Prices reasonable. Drink prices over the top!
5
excellent overall experience, the only thing I would strongly urge would be imposing a dress code. the overwhelmingly underdressed customers, at times in their soaking suits and towels, were quite unappetizing at times, and the aura of the restaurant deserves more than that.
5
This is a nice cafe tucked away on the poolside of Shangrila Hotel. The very cozy set up is the best place to chill out after a whole days activity. The fresh and healthy food options are a welcome treat! Try it!
5
I ate here several nights during my stay and greatly enjoyed the food. The steak and salmon were both excellent. I really enjoyed sitting on the patio tables with views of the pool area.
4
Was couped up all day, so was anxious to get outside. Great, poolside experience. We sat in the shade with ceiling fans overhead that kept the air quite comfortable. Service was a bit slow, but the food was good.
4
Stayed with my wife at the Shangri-La, Singapore, in early July and had the pleasure of being able to eat breakfast at the Waterfall Café....which was fantastic! Had the option of dining at The Line (buffet), which we did a couple of times - until we discovered Waterfall Cafe. The contrast between The Line and Waterfall, in terms of atmosphere and comfort, is ''chalk and cheese''. The Waterfall is just an oasis from the hustle and bustle of a very busy breakfast area at The Line (albeit - definitely the best breakfast buffet I've partaken of). The service at the Waterfall is top notch and we really enjoyed engaging with the waiters and chefs who periodically came by our table to see if all was well. Nothing was too much trouble and, critically, we couldn't have asked for a better breakfast to start our day. When back at the Shangri-La....will most definitely re-visit Waterfall Café
