The dry mee pok with chilli tasted good. The texture of the mee pok is cooked just right. The soup is tasty and goes well with the favour of the mee pok Worth the price of $4 per bowl.

Definitely one of the better mee pok (dry flat noodles) that still lives up to its reputation with the long queue everyday.
Noodles are cooked to perfection, never soggy just right crunchy.

Always come here for breakfast when I m in Singapore. Love the noodles with plenty of crispy pork fat. Long Q on weekends.

What I like about this place is that although crowded, yet there are ample seats. While waiting for your noodles, i suggest ordering the Ngor Hiang as that is excellent. Back to the noodles, the pork lard is awesome !

We came here fortnightly or monthly for the mee pork and lasi lemak next door. You can get food from both coffee shops without getting compliant from either of the staff. Take note the long wait for the mee pok could be between 30-45min depending on the time of the day you visit. Parking is just beside the coffee shop, quite convenient. Would say this is a favorite hang out for easterner. Would recommend for those living in the east

My friends told me they will surprise me with a new eatery I would like knowing what my. Or I g breakfast taste is like.Omg ! Truly, it was a pleasant good feel to drop by a casual place with jammed packed customers. All tables were taken. We waited a good 15 minutes before we were able to secure a table for 3. Took a further 30 minutes before our Mee pok Bak Chor MEE was served. Truly good, mee's was silky, tasty ... with lard & Chilli mixed together. Any delights were the Lok Lok. Beautiful lobak, prawn crackers, fish ball ... u name it. A place I would strongly recommend. I will be back.

Personally I don't like fish balls cause of the fishy smell. But their fish balls are bouncy and no fishy smell at all. Their chilli is nice and remember to load your bowl with lotsa fried crispy pork lard. This place is a self service concept so mix your chilli paste with vinegar for the extra oomph!!

The fishball noodles used to be delicious and yummy with reasonable price and good service bringing the food to your table. Now, the price is up to sgd 5 small bowl but the quality had down. Perhaps the change of the cook. Plus, you need to take your food yourself with the tag sounded. I saw there are enough helpers to serve to desk. The workers have bad attitude on why he cant help to serve to desk since he saw us moving uo and down when we ordered more than 10 bowls, he said the system is for patrons to take themselves. Attitudes sucks.I will consider again whether to go again

This is one of my favorite place to visit for a hot bowl of traditional singapore bah chor mee. Though the prices these days have increased tremendously at $5 for a small bowl.It's typical and old fashion bah chor mee, comfort food to the typical Singaporean. Can have it for breakfast or lunch or even dinner:
