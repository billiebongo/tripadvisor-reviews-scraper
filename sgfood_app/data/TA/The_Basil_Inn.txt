Good, FAST food. Thai themed, with a definite mainland Asia flair. Plenty of seating, even for babies.

Just went there again today to enjoy the fantastic Thai food that they surf.
Do note that they have moved to level 2 of the e-gallery right beside Cueguru.

What a let down. Worst pineapple rice I have ever tasted. Sent it back it was so bad. This after waiting 40 minutes for our food, and they forgot two dishes. Won't be back, which is too bad as it used to be fairly decent.

Some of the best Thai food around! The chef is an elderly Thai lady and it shows in the food. It honestly deserves five stars with the exception of the waiting time. That belong said, I can wait!

We were 7 for lunch. They were nice to accommodate my husband and mother-in-law's food allergies. The problem came when we saw a big cockroach near the serving area/desk. Absolutely disgusting!

The foods are delicious and the staffs are friendly.
The tom yam clear soup is a must and definitely for those who loves spicy food.

Boss brought us there for a treat and I was won over by the appetising fare. Brought my family there and the children enjoyed the dishes thoroughly, ranging from fried honey chicken, stir fried kangkong, fried minced pork egg, basil chicken, desserts to iced milk tea and lemongrass tea. Will be back for more! Yummy

It has been years since I ate here (they were in a much smaller location within the same building) and it was very good. Ordered Pad Thai, Phad Kra Pow Moo, Thod Mun Goong and Pak Boong Fai Daeng. All passed with flying colors and authentic. Whole meal was $27 with two bottles of water, which by Singapore standards is OK. Prices are slightly lower than Golden Mile and reasonable enough. I highly recommend

I ordered this dish because I love garlic dishes!
The pork came with chopped fried garlic. The pork was okay but the garlic had an absolutely burnt after taste. I would not be eating there again!

I come to this place often and seen it grow in size. the food is extremely similar to street food in Bangkok and price is pretty reasonable. I especially like their Tom Yum Talay and Grapow Gai, which is very spicy.

Yummy authentic Thai food cooked by Thais. Price are reasonable and affordable. Ordered the huge steam fish and was one of the best I've tried, flesh was soft and fresh. The eggplant with mince chicken was yummy too. I enjoyed my meal. :)

It was an accidental find that proved rewarding. Basil Inn is a very simple restaurant that requires you to fill in the order chit and place your own orders at the counter (and pay upfront). No fanfare, no elaborate deco, no uniformed service staff...it's the food that matters most. While there's not much of service here, the service staff are simple, friendly and helpful. Food wise, every dish I've tried is authentic and tasty! Their steamed fish is a must try, as with their beef soup, chicken wings, tom yam soup, pineapple rice, papaya salad, tapioca etc....The fact that we visited the restaurant three times in a roll is enough said about the food here.....uncomplicated dining experience, just focus on the food

Basil Inn is really a nice place to dine in with family and friends. I've just been to basil Inn on tuesday to dine with my mum , sister and mum's colleague and I've already anticipating for the next visit. My family and I have been a regular customer for approximately 2 years and we did not get sick and tired of it but instead we love it more. I had forgotten to take pics of the food and started eating already because I was famished so sorry i will remember in future But we usually order the same dish like The Tom Yum Soup Large , lemon grass drink , Fried Fish , Basil Chicken with rice etc. And though it takes quite a long time to serve sometimes , it is worth the wait The shop used to be near the costa sands chalet entrance but shifted into the air condition room because the previous shop is too small for them as customers are always queueing so end up shifting into a bigger shop Try it & tell me how it taste CHEERSSS

I went here for a meal with my girlfriend who is a regular (and has seen the size of this place grow from about 10 chairs to almost 50plus covers now). She has also taken other friends to this joint and everyone have absolutely loved it. Her favourite which we ordered was the steamed seabass with bubbling lemon juice infused with chilli, lemongrass, garlic, coriander and thai herbs, loved this dish and we left it only to the bones. It was authentic and comforting. Highly recommende

I have been a regular of this Thai restaurant for years. They used to be small cafe near the entrance of Costa Sands but has since relocated to a larger shopfront.Food - Aroi Mak Mak!! You gotta try and u'll know.Service: Friendly service. But food arrivals is too slow given that kitchen is now larger.Ambience: Good with Thai music!! But crowds make it nois

By far, I feel that this place serves the most authentic Thai food in town. When I first knew this place, it was a hidden gem in the East, nicely tucked away in one of the busy lanes in Downtown East.My all time favourite dishes are stir fry morning glory, their signature steam fish, green curry chicken and basil minced chicken (you can have this in either pork, chicken or prawn), mango salad and papaya salad. The taste of each of these dishes made me feel as if I was eating in the street of Bangkok. Their prices are very reasonable, the service is extremely friendly and the ambience is great with Thai hits accompanying your meal. It's definitely a place to go for authentic Thai food. Awesome. Two thumbs up!!

I have personally been a regular diner at The Basil Inn with my friends and family for the past couple of years. The service speed may be slower as compared to other dining options within the vicinity but that might actually be alright, given the crowd they receive everyday.The quality of the food is definitely there. It's not that different from the Thai food I had when I went to Thailand itself, but beware the extreme spiciness! It'll be wise to ask for less chilli used if you're not one for it. I'd recommend the tom yum goong and rice with minced pork, along with a glass of Thai iced tea to cool your tongue from the searing spiciness

This restaurant serves the best basil chicken in Singapore. Chefs and most staff are Thai, food is very authentic. Service can a bit slow, but overall, still friendly. Their Thai ice tea is also good. Olive fried rice and fried wings are alright, but nothing to shout about. Very reasonable pricing.Please try their basil dishes! Beware tho, it is spicy
