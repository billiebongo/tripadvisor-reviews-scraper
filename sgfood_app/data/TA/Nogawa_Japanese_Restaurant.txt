Sashimi platter were bad. Fish smells and taste bad. Smell Fishy and spoil the rest of the night. Will not recommend this Japanese restaurant to anyone or not coming back. Value for money - extremely poor.

Fresh sashimi and good spread. Very attentive service staffs. Good location with quiet environment to gather for a good conversation.

This is to me the best Japanese in Singapore! Not cheap, but just perfect! I will not write more, just that you have to try, and take your credit card with you

Japanese food does not come cheap in Singapore (or anywhere in the world), but Nogawa, one of the oldest Japanese restaurants in Singapore, does not disappoint. It is rather pricey, but yet not so bad compared to other high-end Japanese restaurants serving similar food. Their fish is flown in from Japan, and their sushi and sashimi are of excellent quality. The owner, Nogawa-san, who makes the most amazing sushi, unfortunately has retired, but he now has a team of young sushi chefs holding the fort. The food is still good though

Parking - note that when approaching the hotel car park, you should go to the ramp heading down.The restaurant is located in the hotel lobby.Decor is typical blond wood, but with a slightly dated feel.We were served by the main sushi chef at the counter. He was knowledgeable but I personally found too much of a flatterer.The variety of fish is interesting but not particularly numerous. Their selection of food is highly seasonal.We tried some grilled seasonal fish and they were well prepared. We also tried a variety of sushi / sashimi and they were also very fresh with the exception of the uni.The uni was served too cold and had an oddly astringent aftertaste. That said it was very sweet. However the combination wasn't pleasant.Pricing was very high. Perhaps it's because we didn't go with a set menu but it worked out to well over $200 per person for lunch for not particularly alot of food and no alcohol.Overall, the quality of food is good. But it was not a mind blowing experience given the price. I don't feel the urge to revisit

Long before celebrity chefs started coming to Singapore, Nogawa San was pioneering and busy training the TOP Japanese chefs in Singapore eg Aoki, Shiraishi just to name a few. you'll get pretty much anything you normally would get in Tokyo traditional sushi joint. and fresh. from nice exotics to fear factor challenges. Nogawa San is not into fusion and Nor am I. and he smiles a lot more than Jiro. No airs. gotta respect this one. We've been going almost 20 years and we will keep going for fantastic food, simple pleasant ambience, excellent service and decent sake list. why change? been tempted and tried others but pound for pound, this one still puts up a decent benchmark to the celebrities and talented upstarts.

Came here on a business dinner with three other people. The atmosphere was very laid back and we discussed business in between conversations with the chef. The business partners that brought me here took care of the ordering, but everything that came out was really good. The fresh grated wasabi and cold Asahi beer made it that much better. I will absolutely go back during my next visit to Sing

Restaurant was recommended by a Japanese colleague. Food quality was good - but several normal items (eg uni) not available. Service was awful, inattentive and very slow. Almost believed I was in the Philippines so much was "out of stock". Wine selection is already extremely narrow and a lot was sold out, extraordinarily, even several of the few sake selections were sold out. Overall, quality OK, everything else disappointing, won't be going back

Great choice, the japanese Chef prepares all sushi and sashimi (and more) in front of you.Excellent taste, except maybe the sea scallops in an algae sheet, tasteless frankly.Small and cosy ambience, only few tables and bar style, all true Japanese style.One thing is: look at the price list first, as we ended up paying 466 SGD for 3 guests, by far more than usual. The Chef keeps on preparing new sushis until you ask him to stop

Authentic sushi restaurant in the Concorde hotel. Staff is very friendly and help full.
The food is amazing and will certainly come back here. Not cheap but worth the money.

A great example of japanese food , very authentic and a great menu , but not cheap , alcohol very expensive.

A small restaurant but the intimate experience with chef Kevin really makes for a fabulous dining experience. Sitting watching as a vast array of fresh, tasty sushi immaculately presented is worth the not inconsiderable price.

i love the sushi of this restaurant & their staffs, the price is reasonable. But it's rather far from my hotel Grand

I ate at Nogawa last week.The food was brilliant and the chef's are freindly, the wait staff not so much.I had a selection of sushi and was suprised to see the bill come in at $280 SGD.I do not think this is value for money and did not return over the 6 nights i stayed in the area

Been seeing Nogawa San and his team for almost 20years. Little has changed but why change when one strives for, achieved and has maintained TOP traditional sushi? This is not for trendy fashionable fusion types. Think Jiro but without the silence and stern looks. Over the years some ingredients are less common but always seasonal and fresh and well executed. Ask and you can still get delicacies/exotics like abalone liver, grey mullet roe, fugu, angkimo etc. Some imperceptible renovation but essentially nothing changed ambience wise. Try it. Prime Ministers, Presidents have.

With the post integrated resort invasion of the >$400 dinner omakase meal (shinji, waku gin, hashida etc) , our old masters of authentic japanese sushi tend to be forgotten. Nogawa San opened his restaurant in Lucky Plaza in 1979 and he is responsible for so many of Singapore's best local sushi chefs. His restaurant has moved a number of times (japanese association, sentosa) but Concorde hotel has been 'home' for the last 6 years. I popped in for lunch earlier this week to see whether this grand dame had lost its touch. Greeting me right front and centre at the sushi counter was Kan Kok Cheng. He was always my go-to guy at Tatsuya in Goodwood Park hotel. Knowledgeable, friendly and above all wonderfully sensitive to flavour, temperature & texture balance when making sushi, he ranks for me as the best non Jap sushi chef in town. I will let the pictures tell the story. Apologies that I only have pictures of about half the food served, the rest were gobbled down before I could get a picture! I paid $160 for omakase sushi lunch. Is this a better omakase meal at that price than shinji, hashida or ashino? They all have their own subtle differences. I would have to say that any of them would satisfy my need to have a 'tokyo michelin style sushi joint' fix. Certainly not the same quality/value versus tokyo's finest but a great meal nonetheless. In Summary for Nogawa, my key point is that it is probably the only 'local' sushi joint I would consider on par with the likes of shinji, hashida and ashino.

I have been eating Nogawa San's sushi for 30 years and he is still at the top of his game. Nogawa San opened the very first traditional sushi restaurant in the basement of Lucky Plaza, when Lucky Plaza was still new. I still remember standing outside the restaurant, in a queue, waiting to be seated in that little restaurant with only a sushi counter for about 10 pax. Today, Nogawa is located in the Concord Hotel at the tail end of Orchard Road, close to the Istana. I was at Nogawa's for three meals in the past month and each one was excellent. Once I just had the set lunch, and twice I had Omakasei. Do order the Omakasei, which is chef's choice in Japanese. Tell the waitress or your attending chef at the sushi counter what you don't like and they will work around it. If you are willing to be more adventurous and let them surprise you, you just may be surprised that there is such delicious food you didn't know about.In my opinion, it is much more value for money to eat here than one of those over the top expensive new sushi restaurants

We went to Nogawa during our weekend trip to Singapore. We were recommended by a friend to try this place. And I have to say it was quite a satisfying experience. Very fresh and good quality seafood. Loved the hotate sushi and plus the owner himself at the time who served me at the sushi bar. Will definitely go back there when we go to Singapore

Fish is so fresh and the rest of the ingredients always superb, beautifully served, and delicious.
Excellent Japanese food with friendly service located inside the Concorde Hotel

I found Nogawa when I first moved to singapore, and while staying at the Shangri La hotel in singapore my buddy and I decided to venture out and found Nogawa after googling "the best sushi in singapore". It's located in the concord hotel right next to the front desk. It doesn't seem like anything extraordinary but little did I know that Mr Nogawa is the father of sushi in singapore and every top chef in singapore at one time or another learned under this master. As you enter your greeted by a women dressed in a traditional geisha outfit (Not sure if described properly). There was an imposing figure behind the counter and we promptly sat down. Little did I know but Kevin is a gentle giant. He guided us through an experience of a lifetime. Seafood is flown in on wednesday's and saturday's from the famous Sushi Dai Tsukiji Market (on one occaison I watched a chef cleaning a squid that actually inked on his apron during one of my many saturday lunchtime sashimi/sushi Omakase. The salt is ground daily from a giant crystal from the himalayas. The wasabi route is ground in front of your eyes. At first you're given a "fuit" tomato cut into four with himalayan rock salt. It will be the finest tomato you've ever eaten (I actually had a second for desert instead of ice cream!!!) Kevin then carefully and methodically guides you through your journey - put lime on the flounder, dip the hamaci into the soy sauce concoction, and never put anything on the toro as it is the highest sin. **Make sure when your order sake you drink with the chef's - this is proper etiquette and makes every time a different and unique experience** I brought my sister here who's a picky eater and had her eating baby squid, oysters, uni, and in the middle of the meal she punches me in the shoulder and looks at me and says f*** you and then says the same to Chef Kevin - both of us look in astonishment and then she promptly says "I can't eat sushi after this, you've ruined it for me, this is so far above and beyond anything I've ever eaten, when I return it will taste like cat food!" Expect to spend around $180 SGD PP however you can make this lower if you'd like - however I would recommend to let Kevin have carte blanche and you won't be disappointed

When looking up this restaurant, 2 listings in TripAdvisor. Have dined there several times over the year. When we want authentic sushi, this is the sure place. Chef Kevin was there to take care of us again at the counter. As usual, we always go for omakase- chef's choice. Fish is so fresh and the rest of the ingredients always superb. We must have had about 10 courses- 1)little baby green salad; 2) sweetest Japanese tomato (no picture on first 2 courses, so good I can eat 3 of those tomatoes alone!) 3) the enoki, leek and tuna belly in clear benito broth- heavenly light & flavorful! 4) chopped green onion wrapped in shaved Wagyu beef--oozing rich; 5) fresh bamboo shoot- very light/good; 6) pickled root vegetables--OK, crunchy; 7) steamed red snapper in soy sauce- superb flavor; 8) sashimi-- as expected fresh great quality cuts; 9) various sushis- including uni- sea urchin roes- no picture; 10) Strawberry-- sweet/ low acid.We offered sake and toasted with Kevin. My tea was always changed to keep it hot. All in all an excellent friendly service.Given it's locate inside the Concorde Hotel a dated hotel, where the neighboring businesses are sailor bars, it's not much else to say. Ordered a bottle of a nice sake and a green tea as well, bill was close to S$800 for 2. It's definitely a splurge. Clients were mainly Japanese businessmen. Will definitely go back there

It was my go to place for celebrations especially to reward myself when it was at Takashimaya. Then there was a proliferation of many new japanese restaurants in the past 10 years, and in comparison, Nogawa at the hotel known previously known as the old Le Meridien Orchard, failed to sparkle. I had an omakase lunch which was lack lustre. It was still good though. Maybe it is the location, it was more suited for a quick lunch catering to the business crowd. An omakase seems quite out of place, and the other diners looked happy with their bentos.
