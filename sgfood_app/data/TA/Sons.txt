I’ve been to &Sons often and every time I visit, the food quality remains. One of the best restaurants if you’re looking for comfort food.
5
Had their lunch menu. Food was good. Attentive waiters. Nice ambience. Highly recommend. Will be a returning visitor :)
4
The beef cheeks were the star of the show. We were so impressed by how tender it was and we did not even need a fork to eat the dish!
3
Standard of food dropped a lot. Had chicken and was so tough I can't cut. Standard of potatoes used to be good but also dropped a lot and is soggy
3
Used to be one of my fav Italian
My medium rare steak was medium and the burata didn’t impress. The wine by glass was good deal though
Suggestions to expand wine selection.
5
Came here for a business lunch and the chicken I had was pretty decent, with great potato and salad sides. Service was friendly and prompt. Was a surprise to find cheap drinks there as well; explains the crowd. Will come back again.
5
Staff was attentive and I was pleased with her service. Food is good. A band was playing, and the overall ambience is great.
4
The service was very attentive and the wait staff were really friendly. Overall a pleasant experience with good portion sizes. But should improve on the tenderness of the meat.
3
This restaurant is fine as a business venue to discuss. There was confusion on where my guest was as although we both said my name he was put inside and myself outside.....leading to us both thinking the other person had not turned up!Also the service was pretty slow in bringing somethings like coffee but super fast in other things like the mains.Nice location though
3
I have heard of &sons for ages and suggested it to my friends cause I had it on Entertainer App. Overall, there were hits and misses. We like the truffle pesto pasta and I thought the sea urchin carbonara was okay but some of my friends thought it was too dry. Hmm cocktails were 6 bucks, considering the price it was just okay. Our service staff was pretty prompt and came to check on us several times. Point to note, if you want to catch up with your friends and it is Friday Night, take the outdoor seat at the corner because the music can be pretty loud.With entertainer, we paid 100 plus for 5 mains and around 5 drinks which was really reasonable. Hmm don't think I will return, except maybe if I'm in the vicinity for lunch. Lunch seems to be a good deal. A little underwhelmed by the experience perhaps because I came with really high expectations. One of my friend who has been here a couple of times said she remembered the pasta to be better, so perhaps I wasn't there on such a good day.
4
I was impressed with this place for the presentation of food and the reasonable prices that accompanied the dishes and drinks. Will very likely revisit to explore the rest of their menu.
4
Went there on Thursday night. Staff are very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The food is well prepared and presented
4
a regular place for cbd goers. their lunch sets are priced attractively and the food quality is great for the price too.
5
We had a wonderful time because everyone was attentive and always wearing a smile. We rarely receive such genuine and warm service from everyone in a restaurant.
4
Went as a group and we shared the dishes. Decent portion and service. Worth the money. Will try again next time!
5
Went there for friend's birthday. There's live music on Wednesday night and $6 cocktails at happy hour too! Great ambience, great pastas. 10/10 would recommend
5
This is hearty comfort food at its best, all washed down with a lovely bottle of Prosecco! The atmosphere is warm, and service is refreshingly attentive and friendly. We make a special trek over from the east just to treat ourselves to our favourite Wagyu beef cheek dish! The whole grilled Italian seabass dish is delicious too. If you have room after filling up on the tasty appetisers and mains, do try to fit in their sweet desserts!
3
We had a pasta and the ribs. Both were mediocre - which was disappointing given that the place seemed promising with a healthy cbd crowd pooling around lunch time. Their lunch specials are reasonably priced although I'm not optimistic about how they taste since their regular dishes which were more than double the price weren't anything to shout about. Food was rather dry, stingy with the sauce and bland. Not what you hope for when you order ribs
3
Yeah... we came late cause i cant find the restaurant. it takes me 30 mins to find &sons. Nice atmosphere and its a huge restaurant i must say. Can imagine during busy lunch service! I had pasta with vongole but not the butterscotch! Was very hungry.As it looks so much appetizing but not as appetizing as it taste. Overall it was fine just that a little too much lemon on it! To be sure myself, i asked the staff and yes i was right!I dont remember i ever had spaghetti vongole with lemon. Maybe Sautee clams and mussels! But thanks to the service staff who actually show concerns! Especially that European lady! You know who you are.Even my friend said to me that I make them worried! Lolx!But yeah... Skip the lemon the next time for me please! Wil i come back?Yes... Definitely!
5
Italian menu with a variety of antipasti, pastas, drinks and desserts. We had the Wagyu beef ravioli, Sea urchin carbonara, Duck confit and a delicious Seabass to share â€“ all came in very big hearty portions. Also pleasantly surprised when the server shared that they make their own bread and cure their own meats in a curing room at the restaurant. Moved on to drinks after dinner, wide selection of whiskeys, gins, cocktails etc. And coincidentally a live band was playing when we visit, overall a great place for group dinners with food that is value for money and delish
3
Had a nice evening, with excellent service from a waitress with Eastern European accent.
The food was good, and atmosphere busy, but pleasant.
Live music was too loud, not a fan.
4
The lighting and excellent music made for a good TGIF venue. Food was good as well, didn’t take too long to come.
3
Love their lunch menu and always look forward for lunch at &Sons since I work nearby. Went for lunch recently and their food standard wasnt the same anymore. Abit disappointed with pasta and bruschetta. Left the restaurant feeling meh...,
3
Had an awesome meal here a few years back and was looking forward. However the pastas were average and the service was dismal.
4
Though the Wagyu cheek was a generous portion, there's a missing spark in the dish. Lamb was really good but too little. Visit on Wednesdays for $6 cocktails and a great live band
4
Service is good. Fresh food served. Ordered the grilled sea bass and steak. My client's loved the food and so did I. Waiters were attentive. I would definitely recommend this place to others!
4
Overall decor was good, kinda an old British pub feel, though seats under the sunroof can be too hot during lunch hours. The Duck Legs Confit came with 2 duck legs, which was abit too filling albeit being quite crispy and delicious. On the other hand, the Tagliatelle with Foie Gras seems small as compared to the other pasta we ordered. No set lunch menu, but there was lunch specials
4
I was there with my friend and tried the lunch pastas, which turned out to be very good. The service was OK, and the folks are quite friendly. My penne dish with pork cheek was done al dente (just as I like it) and with the added dash of chili flakes, it was great! I don't mind going back again to try out the other lunch items
4
Went &Sons for a quick business lunch and ordered their lunch sets. At less than $20 per lunch set on average, it was very value-for-money. The portion was quite filling and it was not packed which makes it easy to have a quiet conversation. I ordered the beef steak which was average. Will consider coming here again
2
I googled this place and the reviews were really great - the food though is such a disappointment. Nothing like the reviews. The Gastrobar was almost empty. So it was no fun to come. Some of the well known dishes were no longer available. The others were described so nicely in the menu but completely inedible eg the salad was too oily. The sea urchin carbonara had no sea urchin, a lot of oil and cheesy etc. The eggplant parmigiana was over done. Dessert was also disappointing. Service was good but that was about it.
4
Had lunch with a client. Service was quick, efficient and pleasant. Enjoyed the cod.Not a place for a formal lunch but casual is fine.
4
The food served with right portion. But the meat is abit dry for me. I ordered a beef with medium rare but it become well done. But overall the service is good and the menu looks interesting. Thanks
4
This restaurant has several sister restaurants that are amazing. They use freshly made pasta and ingredients that are fresh. The g
4
i'm a pasta lover and i would definitely recc this place! such a wide variety to choose from and ingredients are fresh. Would be back!
4
nice pasta dishes and great ambience for a night out at china square. dishes were nicely presented. would definitely return again.
4
Went during lunch hour on a week day with my colleagues and we used the Entertainer app. The food was good and value for money!
3
We had a simple team lunch at the venue and the service is simple and cosy.
Great place for a casual lunch.
4
The wagyu beef ravioli was amazing, garlic bread appetiser did not have enough garlic, and the beef cheeks were slightly too cloying to be enjoyable. Would recommend the ravioli.
1
I visited &Sons for the second time today for lunch. My first visit to &Sons was at dinner time a few months back where I had the uni carbonara pasta (can't remember the exact name off the top of my head). It was terrible but I partially attributed it to my error in selection as it was an exotic flavour. Went back today for lunch and had the linguine seafood marinara. The seafood was not fresh and I couldn't finish my meal. Never heading back again
5
Nice suprise , good location , choice of seating inside or outside . Service very good inc recommendations.Food also better what I was expecting , fish steak and beef steak very well served . Dessert , chocolate pudding very delicious. Happy hour till 8pm.I would recommended that place
2
After reading the good reviews, it was surprising how lacklustre the food was. I ordered a spaghetti with prawns and aside from the taste of garlic, there really wasn't anything else.
3
Came here again for lunch today and opted for the sea bass. A little too oily for my liking but still tasty. Prices continue to be quite reasonable here. Half pints of beer for $5 to accompany the meal.
4
Food was delicious and service was great. Ask for a special that's not in the menu, it always seem to be good.
4
I enjoyed the Duck Confit here with a glass of iced lemon tea. A generous portion of duck (two legs) on a bed of beans which was delicious. It's not the best I have ever had but still a very enjoyable meal and I'd come back again.Great service. As some of you are familiar with the Entertainer App, &Sons has an offer in there too and one of the staff took the time to tell us more about that which I appreciated. Recommended
5
Hello, i am not the most frequent visitor, but i have been to &Sons numerous times. What impressed me the most about this place is not the food, but the service of a dear gentlemen called Rosario (although the authentic Tiramisu is a winner. It is the best Tiramisu i have tried in Singapore to date). It is very rare nowadays to see such genuine service in Singapore, but Rosario was the exception. Sometimes the smallest things end up making the biggest difference. He genuinely talked nicely to us when our meal was late, and was able to recommend the desert which had a nice story to its authenticity. He made my experience that much more pleasant. I feel like the others just go through the motions and do not really care too much for the customer. Bravo Rosario.
5
I love &Sons have never had a bad meal there. It's easy to find, quick, reasonably priced and delicious. Great for after work drinks and dinner. They have a great range of meats and cheese and use good quality produce - gives you an authentic Italian meal in Singapore. For a shared bottle of wine, main and bread starter it was $50 per head, which is decent by Singapore standards!
1
When we said "all at once" at didn't expect the lamb shank to come before the appetisers. Food was mostly served cold, pasta was not al dente. Sea urchin items had zero taste of sea urchin. The baccala alone was not bad though, and the only item which was served hot (accompanied by tasteless tepid sea urchin sabayon). Service was pretty unimpressive, expect to be stuffed into the tiniest table which can accommodate you despite having other tables empty, have your waitress lean across you from the left to place cutlery for the dinner companion on your right. Our waitress kept trying to get us to buy a bottle of wine twice as expensive as the one we ordered. Wine was actually not bad, and inexpensive. In terms of ambience, this place has decent decor but no vibe- half empty on a Friday night, echoey, grumpy staff, can't hear the music, and an aircon vent which was dripping on us. Went here to utilise an Entertainer promotion, wish I could get my time and stomach space back, strongly do not recommend
4
Went here for dinner with friends because of good reviews I found online. Overall, good atmosphere (though it felt rather empty for a saturday night) and good food. The Roast Squash with rucola and truffle sauce is amazing and the spaghetti with sea urchin carbonara is a must-try!! Very delicious. :
4
My friends and I were looking for a chill place to unwind after work -- one that was centrally located, offered both plenty of drinks choices, and casual, but satisfying food. We had prosecco and sparkling Red Wine for pre-dinner drinks, and since the atmosphere was friendly and lively, we decided to stay for dinner. We started off with the Baccala Cakes with Sea Urchin Sabayon and the Homemade Salami Platter (According to our Italian waiter, &Sons is the only place in Singapore to make their own cured meats, salami and cheese!) For the mains, we settled on Wagyu Beef Cheek with Roast Peppers, Spanish Pork Ribs with Butter Potatoes and Lamb Shank with Pumpkin and Eggplant… Adding few glass of Italian wine from their nice selection, we unfortunately had no room for dessert, and stayed instead for an after-dinner Spritz at the bar (yummy) while enjoying the live band! Definitely a place I would come back to with other groups of friends and colleagues
5
Sometimes, when I try a new place, I never know what to expect. In this case, I had an online discount. Even without the discount, I was surprised at the portion sizes and the qualify of the food.The spanish pork ribs (judging from other tables, it is one of the more popular dishes) was probably about 70% of a full slab. It was fall off the bone yet had enough bite to the meat - and the sauce was not overpowering like some places/ The roast potatoes and salad that went with it was also nice. The lamb shank was also nice although I have had as good elsehwhere. The duck confit was a surprise because it was 2 duck legs and not just one. It tasted really good even though bits of it were hardered from the cooking.The mains are priced in the high twenties which is OK considering the serving sizesService was good when I went and free ice water is served ("still or sparking" irks me badly).I will be back
5
to die for beef tagliata,generous duck confit and decadent sea urchin spaghetti. we enjoyed our party so much that we were the last to leave the restaurant. they gAve group discount for online bookings too.
5
Great ambience for a place to chill after work being located near to Raffles Place and CBD area. Walkable Distance from Chinatown downtown line station. Worth the visit.
4
Came here again today for lunch and opted for the beef stew, washed down with a half pint of German beer. All quite tasty and at a reasonable cost of $22 each. Worth another visit.
4
Service staff was friendly & v knowledgeable about the food. Gave very good recommendations. Wagyu beef ravioli was v good.
2
It must be the fairly reasonable pricing for the main course lunches that draw the crowds in. On this weekday visit, the restaurant was at capacity by 1pm.The thin slices of salmon filets for my main course tasted alright though the salad leaves were slightly wilted and the roast potatoes were swimming in oil. My colleague ordered the chicken supreme - two thin slices of overcooked chicken filets served with the same wilted greens and oily potatoes.At S$12.90 and S$10.90 respectively, the pricing is reasonable for Raffles Place and the portion size was fair. You wouldn't be coming here for the quality of the lunch menu though so decide what matters most to you before stepping in.
1
Went for Dinner with my husband. service was very poor. We have to move our own water glasses from One table to another. had to ask them for cutlery twice and salt and pepper arrived after numerous request and top of that food was poor and very bland.They wouldn't top up the water. Basically poor service qualit
3
Had some drinks there and some food and I guess the neighbourhood is definitely of the kind that the more touristy crowd might enjoy, but we only thought it was so so. Very friendly and helpful staff though and the food was OK, we've had worse and you might expect worse given the touristy aspect of it, but still we will not be going back. The fact is there are so many good places in Singapore and if you're only average then there's no reason to go back
3
Nice guy, took my salmon order without mushrooms. Things can kill me. It was good but not great. It probably tastes better until leaving when they refused to split the bill on credit cards. Hey I get it, but you know, my colleagues and I just won't be back. Not because of the food, but because others do. Sorry dudes
4
For week nite, there was about 4 other tables occupied besides me. The restaurant was hugely empty. Service was great with water refilled often. There's happy hour prices on the wines. I started with Baccala Cakes with Sea Urchin Sabayon. It looked like 2 char black balls, coz the crust had squid ink in it. Inside filled buttery salted cod fish.Next I had Spaghetti with Sea Urchin Carbonara. Crunchy crispy bacon bites with buttery rich sauce on top. Delicious but very oily
3
We had tagliatelle pasta with truffles at this restaurant for lunch along with tomato and mozzarella salad. The truffle wasn't that strong and the dish need a bit more salt. The salad was good. Nothing special but just okay. It was better when I had the same dish a month ago - may be it was not great day at work for the chef!We had tried baked eggplant, gnocchi with mushrooms and the pumpkin tortilla, along with pasta and truffles then. I had rated it highly then but unfortunately it wasn't up to the high standards this time. Had been there only twice and hence don't know whether they are inconsistent. Service is super quick and comes with a cheery smile. Good for a quick decent lunch.
5
The pasta we ordered was cooked perfectly, it wasn't overcooked. The seafood in my marinara was fresh and lovely flavored. My associate ordered the carbonara and it was fantastic too. The photo speaks for itself.
5
Really nice place if you are around Raffles, China Town, CBD.
They offer 9-15SGD Italian lunch dishes (Milanese, steak, pasta, salad). Big portions at great quality.
Owner is very friendly and service is decent.
A must visit place for lunch!
5
I love coming here for dinner, especially for their pasta!
Also, grazie Rosario for being the perfect host! I will definitely be back soon!
4
We settled for &Sons with my family and had a small lunch with pastas and we all enjoyed the lunch.
The ambiance was a bit noisy with all the office people having their lunch but the service was very nice
4
Came here today for lunch with a colleague and opted for the seabass and a half pint of German beer for a cost of around $20 in total. Food was quite reasonable considering the price and the portions were good. It seems to be a very popular venue and there was a queue of about 15 people when we left around 1:15pm
5
We had the lamb shank and lamb chops when we came here for a business lunch. Excellent location and great service. The pumkin puree on the lamb shank was really tasty and the shank was cooked perfect. The chops were average and can be done better, a little fatty but the caponata served with it was good
4
Went for lunch with a friend. I had beef ravioli which had a light taste with pasta thickness that was spot on. Very tasty! My friend's duck confit was magnificently crisped on the outside. Inside it didn't fall off the bone as it should, but was good quality and still delicious.My first time to visit for lunch. It was popular, which was justified, and the service remained unhurried yet available when wanted.Overall a happy experience
1
I am sad to write a bad review for this establishment as we held our engagement party with 100 friends there nearly 2 years ago (soon after it opened). We have since been recommending it to friends and colleagues for its usually wonderful Italian food in the centre of town.Today was a newly poor experience. I ordered the pork Milanese, which is a lunchtime special for $12.90. After eating just over half the pork (cooked well), I cut into the end and saw that it was very raw - dark pink. As anyone will know, it is very dangerous to undercooked pork. My wife, who was dining with me, is pregnant – imagine if it had been her who ordered it. I told the waiter about the issue and he brought the manager over. The manager was apologetic but in a way dismissed it by saying it’s hard to cook through with the thickness of the meat. He offered to replace it with something and I asked for a small portion of my favourite pasta dish, the pumpkin tortellini (which had been on the menu until recently for about $13).When the first version of the bill came it not only had the replacement pasta (charged full size at $22), but the pork Milanese was also on the bill at $33 rather than $12.90! Apparently our waiter had assumed I ordered the a la carte version of the pork Milanese rather than the lunch special of the same dish (why on earth would he assume that?!). I was made to feel partially responsible for the ‘misunderstanding’ with the waiter about this, despite ordering the Milanese several times before and only ever getting the lunch special. The bill then came back with the pork taken off but the pasta still on the bill for $22! We were really struggling to get through to the manager that his staff had made 2 mistakes, one with a serious health risk, so why should we come away paying several dollars more?! He eventually offered us a 10% discount on the second bill plus complimentary coffee. I since saw a note online that if two people order together there at lunch time they get a 10% discount on the bill anyway! Wow.Truly a baffling and disappointing experience. Won’t be returning to this place sadly - gone to the pits in terms of service, quality and honesty
5
I was pleasantly surprised with the high standard of lunchtime fare. &Sons offers an outstanding selection on its lunch menu brought to your table with the usual Singapore efficiency. But for me what stood out the most was the superb waiter who was the embodiment of professionalism. When the bill came a gladly paid
3
The boss of &son - I hope you are reading this and replace your extremely poor waitresses (ALL of them) at your earliest opportunity.My colleague had made a reservation for a party of 6 for lunch on Friday. When we arrived it was reasonably packed - not full but almost. First impressions were good. A short wait at the door was fine but what cheesed me off was the people at the bar (entrance) totally ignored our presence. The bartender was busy, so he can be forgiven but there is another lady sitting by the bar (looks like someone who works there) cutting paper - no attempt at all to greet or try to settle us.A few mins later someone finally took notice of my party of 6 - and the waitress was CROSS. No apologies for the wait, no smiles. (What have we done wrong - by showing up???)Ordering was quick, serving speed was reasonable. Our first order of a grilled chicken dish arrived within minutes. Our colleague who ordered it was a bit blur and it was a bit noisy, she couldn't hear the waitress (different from the one we met at the door) who served us the chicken and she repeated herself with disdain/impatience on her face. Is that really necessary?I ordered the Pork Milanese (and pronounced Milanese as Milan-ese), and the waiter had to CORRECT me: Mi-lanese. SERIOUSLY?I know good service staff is hard to come by but surely they need to come with some decent training to match the location... even basic?Food wise, the prawn aglio olio was great, al dente and the prawns were fresh and crunchy. They didn't ask if my colleagues who ordered the steak how they wanted it done. My pork Mi-LANESE was a little bit tough. We ordered two side dishes - the mushroom with guyere and polenta tasted good, fresh but with waaaaaay too much polenta. We also ordered a fish bite with uni sauce (because they ran out of calamari!)although thankfully this was eye opening, interesting and I liked it. Overall good value, good ambiance, I will be happy to return after they've had a chance of staff. Someone please let me know when that happens

Permanent favourite venue for my whiskey sour cocktail. The small plates are great with drinks, esp the foie gras. Very lovely romantic ambience to just chill out after work...
1
I first tried &sons 9 months ago at lunch. Great value and a very good 1 dish lunch. Delicious. I returned 3 weeks ago at lunch again. 15 of us were taken care of by young Max who served us well. However food was distinctly average this. The wow factor was gone. I has prawn aglio olio. Too dry. Flavours detuned... we ordered dishes to share. The cold cuts were also dry, clearly a victim of being prepared and put aside too early in the day. Both dishes getting a 5/10 rating in my book. The pork collar was the major disappointment though. It was barely marinated. Leaving a strong porky/gamey taste with only a hint of salt to leave a lingering unpleasant impression on the palate. Thinking that it was just an off day for the kitchen, I decided to make a dinner reservation for Sept 5th, a birthday dinner for our party of eight with young Max. As the reservation was for a date 3 weeks away, I didn't do anything about it until the day of our dinner. It was odd that the restaurant hadn't called to just reconfirm our reservation. As it was a Saturday and they only open for dinner on Saturdays, I only managed to get through to them at 6pm, 2 hours prior to our dinner. "Sorry sir, I don't see your reservation. Anyways we have a private event and the restaurant is closed to the public."My dinner was only 2 hours away. Unprofessional and unforgivable. Young Max must have forgotten to put the reservation in. Despite going through with me where he was going to locate my table 3 weeks prior at lunch. Fortunately, Nicolas Du Restaurant was able to accommodate our group and e had a great time. No second chances here. Not in my book
4
&sons offers good lunch sets and it's often packed. I prefer to go during dinner though, as the place is rarely packed at dinner time and the mood is more chill. I love the ala carte dinner offerings. My personal favorite is the Taglioni, Crab & Nduja which is out of this world amazing. One of my favorite pasta dishes. The Baccala Cakes, Sea Urchin Syabon is an excellent starter and the cheeses are worth ordering. Go order a mix board for a selection of 5 cheeses. However if you can only pick one cheese, go for the Umbriaco- cheese with wine. But, its not perfect. Skip the desserts - pricey and honestly underwhelming. Their paccheri is well reviewed but i found it unimpressive. In a recent visit during, i was told they did not serve tap water, which i find majorly annoying. That made me deduct a point off this otherwise excellent restaurant
4
...but don't order desserts. We emailed our lunch reservation but somehow it got lost in transit, so our first really good impression was how professionally and promptly the receptionist dealt with it and got us seated, apologizing that the perfectly adequate table was a bit small for three. No fuss, situation resolved and we happily ordered a little lunchtime Prosecco. (Now for those who think it a great way to jump the queue, I want to add that we showed the email that was sent to our receptionist)The place was heaving with office workers and business(wo)men eating mainly set lunch and abstaining from alcoholic beverages, so we could understand that it took a while for the fizzy to arrive. Upon request the very affable manager produced a plate of mixed cold cuts and a nice bottle of red together with some truly outstanding focaccia. Mains of pork chop, pork neck and crab linguini were all very agreeable, but it was the crab linguini that really stood out. After a really nice meal and friendly service, I don't want to make too big a deal of the truly substandard desserts, so just don't order them. All else is really thumbs up good. Reasonably priced, no matter what the stingies are saying.
4
Went on a weekend evening and the place was very quiet (maybe 7:30 is too early?) however the food we had was tasty and for Singapore very good value. The cocktail list was extensive and the drinks well put together. I imagine this will be a busy weekday venue for the CBD workers. Bread made in house a real treat
3
I was dining in w office mates just to enjoy the lunch hour promo deal.The ambience is good. Need to be early to avoid disappointment of no seats/waiting.Food was average but served in large portion.Service was bad. Staff needs to polite especially when serving the food. I m a person who thinks that u need to put the plate for diners slowly and say enjoy your meal rather then just place the plate with ' loud bang plate sound'.Staff also don't answer the questions but busy trying to take a quick order and go.Must try food are like : Spaghetti cabonara with homemade guanciale (a bit stachy), spaghetti with fresh prawns AOP(prawn is crispy), grilled chicken supreme (but the chicken is a bit hard) and comes with potato and salad.I know its Italian food but would be good with chilly sauce and mayo is served esp with the grilled chicken or fish
5
I've been there 5 times in the past 2 weeks if that's any proof of how good it is. We usually order 6 dishes or so with drinks, so the hefty price tag is definitely not unwarranted.Another establishment by Beppe de Vito, this casual dining establishment has all of his amazing Italian influences at relatively affordable prices. It's reminiscent of iL Lido when they were at the peak of their success. Start your meal with a glass of Bellini, which uses real fruit puree and not any of those juice concentrates. The Burrata salad is fresh and amazing, and so is the less knowned Caciocavallo, a dish of grilled smoked cheese and avocado. They cure their meats in-house, so do give their salamis and Proscuitto San Daniele a go. For pastas the Crab Tangliolini and Sea Urchin Carbonara are must-tries. As a side, go for the Baccala cakes.For photos and the full review, head over here: http://www.chocolat-et-basil.com/#!Sons-Bacaro/cmbz/CAB34264-5082-4B2F-B69B-E7CAFDD0806

Located on a lively street I chose this restaurant as it served diner past 10PM. I think that is the only positive note to this restaurant.There are no restrooms in the restaurant; you have to walk past 3 restaurants to follow a long corridor to finally reach a public toilet (that could be cleaned more often). Impossible to get access to the wifi as apparently the owner refuses to disclose the password. What is he afraid of or doing with his internet connection? On the table there weren’t any knifes, nor salt or pepper…. A restaurant you call it? I ordered Osso Bucco, it was way too salty and ended up asking for bread to sponge it. And who eats Italian cuisine without bread? The manager had to come over to ask me which bread I wanted as I would be charged for it… Their “Rustic bread” should rather be call “Heated-Frozen bread”. Overall I had a very disappointing experience. I wouldn’t recommend this restaurant knowing there are so many options in Singapore
2
Delicious food, lots of options and very reasonable prices but the staff are unbelievably rude, both at lunch and for dinner. Asking for something to be changed or adapted because I can't eat it shouldn't require FOUR different staff to aggressively interrogate me on what I ordered. Neither should the food just be 'washed' and re-served to me. It was quite clear the offending item was still there. The staff are also very inattentive and it took us a long time to get anything ordered/changed. Before we'd even left the table after paying the bill, one of the staff shoved a reserved sign on the table. Please teach your staff how to treat their customers..
4
I visited &sons with friends (three of us) during lunch time. As expected, a bit crowded and must wait for several minutes before we had our table. Tip: if you are coming in a big group, might as well make reservations to avoid disappointment. Since it was our first visit, we try to tried different dishes from their list of Big Plates Lunch Menu, and we decided to have Wagyu Beef Cheek Ravioli, Homemade Tagliatille Bolognese and Grilled Beef Sirloin Steak. We shared among us that's why we were able to taste these three different dishes and eventually have our verdict with the different dishes. In short during our visit, we come up with:Taste: two thumbs up! Value for money: one thumbs up! Ambience: two thumbs up! (though don't expect too much of personal space and quiet moments since it was lunch time and the place is really crowded)Customer service: Failed! --- why, staff looks so serious, not so approachable and during our visit, we felt that they are a bit grumpy :(Good thing, we enjoyed our food and the company of our friends...
