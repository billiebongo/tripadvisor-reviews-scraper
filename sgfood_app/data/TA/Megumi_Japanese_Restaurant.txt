Always satisfied. A go to place for a simple and satisfying meal. I like the sushi. If I am having an indecisive day, I will settle for the chirashi don - my comfort food.
Tip: parking is available and FOC but very limited.

Been to couple of Japanese places. This place is pretty ok. Nothing great to shout about.Staff and service are also alright. The spider maki and the Ramen is something you can look out for.

A huge thanks to Leon and his Megumi team for providing us with excellent hospitality. Both the culinary and service crew worked really diligently with passion to provide great experience for all my guests. Furthermore not only were their Japanese cuisine very exciting, the value we got from all the dishes was one of the best I ever experienced in Singapore.Cheers

Went back to Megumi , it's been after a while. This jap restaurant has been around in Siglap for many years n have since continued to maintain high quality yet affordable standard Japanese fare. Always crowded. Reservations recommended though knowledgeable, staff will try their best.Must try = butter fish sashimi I can never get this any where...now I feel like eating agai

Never a fan dining in the east due to parking challenges. So we ventured to this place due to high recommendations via reviews.The restaurant shares the building frontage with an italian restaurant and a beauty salon. They have a private car park for 6 vehicles so come early.Visited on a saturday and seafood just arrived the same day. We ordered an imported grouper, had half in sashimi and the ither half grilled. Cost SGD78 but was worth it. Food was fresh, taste between abibe average to excellent, which explains why most tables had reservations.Strongly recommend

We have been living in the East for 20 years and this is the second time we went to this place today (April 30, 2017) thinking that the service would have improved. We were proven wrong. The staff is not trained. We were asked to wait so that table could be cleaned. This is fine. But the staff was pushing all the food on the table and it was not a good sight and defies basic Japanese principle on Hygiene. We ordered the food through the tablet and after placing the order, we were told Salmon was sold out but when the bill came, salmon platter priced $22 was included. The food is just average

Had the best Yusheng (raw fish) this Lunar New Year at the Upper East Coast branch. The fried yam sticks and lotus roots slices add extra crunchiness and fllavour in addition to other ingredients in this traditional dish. I had been enjoying this dish at various well known restaurants in Singapore but none came close. A pity that I have to wait till next year to savor it again. Service was impeccable- one look and the extra dipping sauce for the teppanyaki was at my side . My green tea was constantly refilled and plates changed without asking. Loved the butterfish sashimi and the beef stone bowl. Another fave was the pink sparkling sake. Sashimi was fresh and definitely value for $.

I been many restaurants in Singapore. I like this Japanese restaurant because of they are not rush us for order, the waitress is calm and telling me one by one about their dishesWell, her ordering skill that let's me felt not pushy and more to suggest me the food which suit to me. The sashimi is fresh and most of the seafood are importing from Japan. Special thanks to the waitress, Angel.. Good job.

I visited the sunset way outlet a few times and I usually order the sashimi don. I like that the slices are thick but I feel that the portion doesn't quite match up to the picture in the menu. They used to use the same black bowl (per menu) but sometimes they used the smaller grey stone bowl or other bowls. Food increased price slightly over the years but I would still come back for the good food or when I have sudden cravings. Sometimes they have monthly promotional items which are great. I wished the rainbow sake sushi could remain as a promotional item longer though.

Very high service standard, and the best quality of food. Fresh fish deliveries on Tuesdays and Fridays, so these two days are the best days to bring a visit to Megumi!

Love their salmon belly don and have been their regular for years. A good and reasonable restaurant to dine at. Be sure to make reservations as they are fully seated for dinner on most days.
5
The miso braised cod melts in your mouth and the sushi is fresh, delicious and inspired! I would definitely go back.
4
The wait staff are quite attentive at the start, and would run through all the specials of the day, though some of these are quite expensive. But the food here is of good quality and the sashimi is fresh.

You don't get many good Japanese restaurants in the east so discovering Megumi was a divine delight. The restaurant is not big and it's often very crowded so definitely make a reservation. I've eaten there a few times and highly recommend the food. Of special mention is their raw food selections. It's hard to find really fresh scallops and theirs are not only fresh but succulent and sweet. I also like the beef sukiyaki and don't be shy to ask for top up of the soup. The staff is helpful and responsive despite the bustling business. I am not a fan of tempura but will say the yasai tempura (vegetables) are delicately fried and the batter is just right; not too think and not too batterish. A definite plus if you enjoy Japanese delicacies albeit in slightly crowded cramped settings.

My friend recommended me this restaurant a few years back & I was not terribly impressed. It feels more like a family restaurant with restaurant prices. The restaurant has been in this precinct for 13years so it must have some loyal clientele to keep it afloat. In the interest of time, I treated a friend here for his birthday. They recommend me their daily flown sea-bream which costs $78. Verdict ? It was good but not THAT good to warrant this price. Their other dishes ie. Salad & sashimi were fresh & price points justify the freshness. What really surprised me (on the upside) is their garlic fried rice. Super fragrant! So I brought my Husband (a lover of fried rice). He was Super satisfied. The Creative unagi on tofu is excellent too!

had heard a lot about this little restaurant in the heart of Siglap. Very fresh juicy sushi and sashimi. Went for the fresh fish of hte day cooked 3 ways - the soup was great, especially on a cool windy day. Lunch for two came to SG150Do book, limited seating

Read several bad reviews for service, however my first experience there went well. Staff were polite and attentive. Guess they rectify bad service complains. 2 of us had a chirashi (raw fish w rice), and assortment of sushi. Standard is ok, price wise it's quite average too. If u want something exotic, they have daily special menu, those are expensive. Also, if u have a big table, it might be frustrating to have everyone share 1 iPad for ur orders.

An established Japanese Resturant in the East Coast area that command lots of regular customers. Average S$50 per head, not cheap for a canteen cum fast food style of service and cold ambience. The tables are close to each other to create maximum seating, and we waited an hour for the 'Houbou fish of the day' after 3 reminders (S$50++, a trade-up tactic to increase average check after you'd placed the oder!). This is a popular place among the locals during weekends, so reservation is required, but not a very special place in terms of food style and freshness, just another average Japanese Resturant that lost its plot over the years. Parking is a real problem here, you may have to walk a little bit from the open car park in the vicinity, which is good for digestion

Came here for a late dinner. Sushi was really good, recommend the UFO MAKI and their sashimi! One of the best sashimi I had. However what I find disappointing is the service. Only one of the girl named Charlotte , is genuine and sincere, we waited for the miso soup and chawanmushi for very long and we asked many staffs yet nobody followed up with us, despite many prompting for our long-awaited food, which made us keep waiting and wondered why. The manager was rude and did not apologise for the delay and rush for the bill saying she needed to knock off etc, which is unforgivable. Overall I would come back for the food but not for the service

Really good food and good service! Only downside is that its always packed and theres hardly any seats. However, if you book earlier, theres no problem:). Parking may also be an issue though if its too busy Price is reasonable too.

This place is pretty good for family dinners. Gets very busy so better to book especially for weekend dinner. Sashimi, yakitori, sushi, were all pretty good.
4
Great food and very nice staff. Very under staffed when full, however the chef can stand for hours talking to one table oblivious to the other patrons waiting for assistance which absolutely spoils the otherwise excellent overall appeal.

A very common haunt for me. Can't eat Tatsuya all the time, right?

Lovely fried sushi which is slightly crunchy to eat. Amazing fried rice which my son loves!! It's a great restaurant near home, we'll be back over and over again!

Sashimi is good and prices v reasonable.

This place used to my family's favourite dinner place and I even became a member. Sadly standard has dropped. They are now not serving plain water but sells mineral water instead. We ordered a plate of scallops and mushrooms, there were only 3 half pieces of actual scallops in that dish, they actually cut the scallops into halves, sigh... the serving staff are getting ruder, (we went almost every week as we lived just across the road) sometimes passing remarks that made us feel like we are peasants. They seems to have priced us out the door. A simple meal of 2 ramen, 1 small fried rice (with small pieces of eel) and scallop and plain rice costed more than $87. sigh... good bye megumi, you have become too expensive, proud and rude

Was there twice this month. The first with some long-lost buddies for a birthday party. Returned within a week with my kids to sample the newly-created cooked menu. The sashimi was very fresh and delectable. Big portions of seafood presented nicely. Great range of sake too to go with the exquisite food. The staff were attentive and accommodating to our needs when it comes to the cake-cutting - fresh utensils and matches were provided without request. Even the chef, Adrian, made time to mingle and chat with guests. Enjoyed a wonderful experience with my kids too on my return visit

A cosy setting with a large variety of choices. Very fresh sashimi. The restaurant usually has newly created dishes as specialty, do ask the wait staff about them. The wait staff can be shy, do open up and talk to them, although they could be busy during peak period. Very friendly chef. Nice place to bring the family for a meal, as well as cosy enough for a tête-a-tête

I love going here for the Japanese food. It's so fresh you can taste it in your mouth. Their choices of Japanese fare is quite extensive but try to be adventurous by trying out their specials as well. The only reason why this is not receiving the full star is the wait staff. While they do serve you your food and all, I feel a certain lack of warmth, sincerity or friendliness from them. They are always harried looking and look as if they could do with more manpower. If they could brush up on their service standards, I'm sure they would attract more to their shop
