Tried the Hire, Rosu, Premium Rosu Katsu sets, assorted sashimi and black sesame ice cream. Delicious! This place is hidden in the Isetan/ Shaw Center building, you will need to take the middle escalator to get there.

The food tastes good! It would be even better if they'd served freshly made wasabi. Portions a bit small, therefore it appeared to be a bit pricy
Service was excellent!
I'd go there again

Great Katsu as always. Have been around for many years. Standard still maintain well. One of the few places that I will dine in when I am in Orchard

I love katsu. And I’ve been to many types of katsu restaurants. Tonkichi is one of my fave. I like this branch because they have Seafood sashimi, sushi and the Like , not only fried katsu items. There’s more variety this way. Good for groups or families as there’s more choice for people who don’t want fried food. Rice & salad is refillable for free. That’s fantastic. The Japanese rice is fluffy and cooked perfectly. The sets are not cheap but quality & portions are good. Jumbo katsu set with sashimi & chawanmushi $26, ikura salmon bowl katsu Set $29 (rice bowl was abit small for this), unagi Don rice bowl $25, Seafood katsu Set $23. Over $100++ for 4 pax. Not a cheap meal but very filling and satisfying. The katsu were crisp and done well. Yum yum. One thing- they should drip off more oil before serving. My jumbo rosu katsu was abit half soggy from some leftover oil. The Taste was not affected but the texture was abit soggy. The service staff were courteous and fast. It was a busy Friday night and they tried their best to be attentive. Good job. I’ll be back again! It was enjoyable

This place is the closest to what we can imagine japan to be like. However, not all branches offer the same quality. From experience, the one in Suntec is not as good as the others. In my opinion, here's the best place to get a super ton katsu meal. I do wish the oyster and pork/oyster set meal will come back again. It's pricey without the set value.

This review was for the Tampines outlet. Always the place for me if the crave for comfort food comes. Tried the Kurobuta Tonkatsu set + Asahi beer during lunch. Perfect combination to indulge in my fav tonkatsu + beer and spending time thinking of nothing but pure enjoyment. Only minor comment was the fatty meat in the shoulder pork. But overall, it served its purpose. I got the comfort I needed

Don't get me wrong. I love this place. We've been coming for many years- their portion is generous, price decent, acceptable view and waiters are friendly. So much so we felt comfortable to feedback on the spot while settling the bill, asking if there was a change of Chef or hands. We ordered the Hire Katsu toki which turned out to be quite salty this time round. I feel if we ordered the usual tonkatsu set. It would have been fine.

The tempura here may well be one of the best in Singapore. Very crispy on the outside, without sacrificing the flavour of the dish inside.Not only is their tempura good, their curry is really good as well. The portions are also generous and the cabbage their provide is quite over-the-top - which is a good thing.The sashimi here also tastes quite fresh.We've been here several times despite us not liking entering Orchard road at all

Avocado salad not worth $12 for slivers of plain tasting, poorly torn lettuce & miserably sliced not-so-fresh avocado. Happen to see a plump kitchen staff walk past our table and noticed his uniform was very dirty with stains all over. Makes me wonder how a Japanese restaurant functions here. Now they charge $1 for a cup of tea. Other dishes were ok.

Just a normal Japanese Restaurant. It is in the Takasiyama Mall so if you wish you can walk around in full air conditioned environment after eating and not have to step outside into the steamy weather.

This overlooks the main Scotts road junction and faces the Ion shopping mall, giving us a great view as we savor the fine food. I am a sucker for everything fried, so everything here is great to me! Love the fried oysters especially!

This tonkichi place is functional and blend but their fried stuff are competent. I only come if I am in Lido after watching a movie but will not ma a special trip for their tonkichi!

I came here early at 11.30am with my lunch partner after the Saturday morning gym. We were the first customers there and the waiter is nice to offer us the seats with more privacy since we were the first ones there.It was our second visit to the Shaw House branch and i wanted something with noodles this time round. "I am trying to cut off some calories", was the reason i told my friend though it has been honestly more than 2 years since i last had some cold soba. The portions was just nice and i love the texture of the noodles after dipping it into the sauce. The 2 piece of Hire Katsu is as tasty as always. Crispy on the outside and a nice chewy texture for the inside. "You sure u lose calories?" asked my friend after the meal, "I think you put on more than what u burn just now!" "I will go again tomorrow! My longing for cold soba satisfied and that's all i care about today!" And there goes my diet plan again for the week

Try the Hire set $22 which serves 3 pieces of tender, juicy pork fillet. Ground the sesame seeds till it is powdery. You can add the sweet sauce on it or on the pork fillet. Dip the fillet into the grounded sesame & the aromatic mix delights your palette. Unlimited refills of cabbage (accompanied by super yummy salad sauce, a must try) & miso soup. You pay $20 if you pay by OCBC credit cards

We had a private booth at the back of the restaurant for four at dinner. The prices are good for the quality of food and service. They do have seasonal sets which come at a good value. Very big sets and food quality is rather similar to Sushi Tei. As what the name suggests, they specialise in fried food. The fried chicken is pretty good.

My friend and I were thrilled having lunch at the Tonkichi Japanese Restaurant@Shaw House on 19 Jan 16; as it had been a while since our last visit there in Oct 15 (Lion Star member’s birthday-month promotion). Tonkichi has long been recognized as one of the top speciality restaurants over the years, being known for serving authentic tonkatsu (deep-fried breaded pork cutlet) from various cuts of premium quality pork and seafood. Indeed, its outlets, with their friendly staff and good-tasting food, have managed to maintain high standards of service and food authenticity.It was an easy choice for us to order the Rosu Katsu Set (Pork-Loin Cutlet) and the Maguro Sake Chirashi, as both were our old-time favourites (in particular, nicely-priced as well).We thoroughly enjoyed the food we ordered. The loin cutlet was juicy, crunchy, scrumptious and tasty. My friend who ate the chirashi expressed general satisfaction as well, although he thought the portions of the food were inadequate for anyone with an appetite.The ambience of the restaurant was cosy and relaxing, exuding a comfortable feeling of something familiar, friendly and welcoming. The décor and furnishings (like the portraits on the wall) were characteristically Japanese and minimalistic: bright, cheerful, and clean-cut and warm too.The experience has reaffirmed that Tonkichi is undoubtedly among our favourite local Japanese restaurants serving tonkatsu

There was a time when Tonkichi's fried pork fillets, prawn and oysters were the talk of town because they were fresh, thinly coated with batter/bread crumbs and expertly fried. That plus the unlimited serving of the delicious sliced raw cabbage. Over the years, I have seen how the quality of the food has gone to the dogs. The fried items are all thickly coated with batter/breadcrumbs which are rock solid when served. The items look and taste like they have been barely thawed from deep freeze and thrown into the deep fryer. After each meal, the roof of my mouth is scratched and skin has peeled. After giving the restaurant three tries in two years, its sayonara

We popped in here for dinner after a haircut nearby. Service was excellent and they kept topping up our drinks.The salmon sashimi consisted of five slices and was plump and juicy, though on the expensive side at S$16. My wife had the prawn katsu set while I had the Tori mix set, which consisted of one pork and one prawn tonkatsu, as well as two pieces of chicken kariagge. While they were all fried well, after a while, the taste became indistinguishable and tasted the same - crispy but dry - although the pork was better with a touch of mustard.The chawanmushi was full of flavour and I liked the chunks of shiitake in there. The salad with the ice cold sauce was also a nice touch. All in all, if you happen to be in the area and want a taste of pork (they have various grades), do try this out

We've been going to Tonkichi for years as a family. The tonkatsu is consistently very good. Our kids love the agedashi tofu and chawanmushi there too. Always make reservations to avoid long queues and disappointment. Ask for window seats if you have a party of 4 or 5. Great views of Orchard Road.Keep up the great work Tonkichi
