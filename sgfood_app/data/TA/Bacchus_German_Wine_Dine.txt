Food and the service was memorable and price was reasonable.

While were in Singapore with family, my wife and I just wanted to go for a quiet meal by ourselves. we were staying at the Grand Copthorne Waterfront, so we wanted a place that was a bit more reasonably priced to eat.We strolled along the river on the way to Clark Quay and came across this restaurant.They served a mix of Russian and German cusine (sounds odd but good). the young waiter, Lee could not have been more helpful.The food was plentiful, tasty and promptly delivered.Pots of beer were drink 2 get the third free. I did not want 3 in one hit so we went for a walk for half an hour or so , came back had desert and the third pot.Highly recommend i
