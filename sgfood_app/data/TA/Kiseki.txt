Kiseki offers salmon sushi and a small selection of rolls, however they offer many other delicious selections such as but not limited to fried rice, noodles, chicken, pork meat and many other meals

Kiseki is a japanese buffet restaurant.The restaurant has lots of delicious food,example meat,sushi,fried food,drinks,desserts and lots more.The restaurant is very clean as well.Thank you for reading my review.

Pre-booked a table for 8. The restaurant is very busy even for lunch. Offers a good selection of Japanese cuisine suitable for the young and old.

We celebrated the birthday of my daughter and we were very satisfied the food selection and the accomodation of the pilipino staff..Mr Noli and Marilou do their extra mile service to meet our needs.A highly reccomended place for lunch and dinner,,the price is affordable better than the buffet in the 5 star hotel

One of the best places to have a buffet. Its a Japanese buffet but they have other cuisines available like pasta and baked potatoes which taste great too. Salad greens are very fresh, sushi was good, skewers were delicious, and many soups to pick from. The layout of the restaurant is great. Dessert area is full of cakes and ice cream with many toppings to choose from. Even have mochi of different flavours to choose from. Really worth the money because the service was exceptional. Staff were friendly and all smiles when i was there, even offered me more napkins during my meal. Highly recommended place to dine at

We all remember when Kiseki was the talk of the town several years ago. I made another trip there recently and was gutted at just how much it has changed - for the bad.They no longer serve salmon belly sashimi for weekday lunch(heck, the sashimi variety has been cut by half) and the pasta station was gone too. The biggest gripe would have to be the quality of the food though. Everything tasted mediocre and even the salmon sashimi was off(not fresh).The service we received varied widely. While the guy at the entrance was really friendly and personable, the "aunties" clearing our plates were mostly rude.It's really unfortunate just how much Kiseki has gone downhill. There isn't even a need for a reservations anymore(you used to have to book days in advance) simply because people have responded to the poor standards - by choosing other places to fine dine in, and rightfully so.

Quality of food (in terms of the quality of red meat) : 2 out of 5 starsCold seafood was good. 3 out of 5 starsCooked dishes tad too salty 1 out of 5 starsGrilled meats : 3 out of 5 stars.Desserts: waffles with ice cream the best!Bummer: refill of buffet dishes were slowThe best item i had was the chawanmushi.Not a bad place to dine if you are looking for quantity rather than quality

I have never seen a Japanese buffet restaurant before and I think this is a great idea! I thought the range of food was very good and the variety was terrific with a great range of Japanese food including more upmarket style products.There is a sign on your table saying that they will charge you for food wastage by the 100g - not sure how they enforce this but would be interested if they do - maybe the sign is enough to encourage people to make wise choices! Drinks and dessert are included and service for food clean up was brisk. The restaurant was full when we were there for early dinner however I always felt there was plenty of food, there were no line ups for any item and the food was always being replenished. I would love to see one of these at home

Paying $31.80++ for their weekday dinner buffet. The only section I like is their salmon sashimi, very fresh. The rest are frying food, the hot pot (the soup contains lots of MSG, very thirsty after that), The dessert section is very small and cheap selection. Walking round & round, you donâ€™t see any food that you have desire to try :( this place definitely for tourists who want a quick meal .
5
Pros:1. With SGD 25,66 net on weekday [Monday to Friday] you can eat "All you can eat food".2. Food are fresh.3. The price include free flow drinks.4. Ambiance is comfortable for solo, couple or family.5. Additionally, you can't waste food although it's all you can eat. Supporting this program as some people are greedy!Cons:I wish got the notification that the lunch buffet close at 1520hrs [the entire dining area]. Arrived at 1430hrs and wait staff mentioned that the food will be cleared up at 1445hrs, agreed to it -- taken necessary food I can eat on the table and really take my time. When the cleaner taken away my food, was disappointed as still have 2-more plate to go
5
You are spoilt for choice with the huge generous selection of authentic jap food in kiseki and they just keep topping up the trays that you will never miss out on any item
3
Had good food at affordable prices... can't find any fault with that.. more variety to desserts would be good.
4
Review by Dr Sim. Quite reasonable priced Japanese buffet for lunch. Quite good spread. Not large spread but not small either. For the price it is acceptable. Good for friends to eat slowly and spend the afternoon chatting. Enjoyed it. Regards Dr Sim

Our favourite Japanese Restaurant in Singapore delicious food and reasonable price. The location is accessible to any transportation.
4
Food is delicious. Melt in your mouth sushi. Place is clean with nice staff specially the Filipina. Great dessert buffet
4
It's a different type of Japanese buffet, compared to the sushi and steamboat which we are used to. Definitely worth giving it a try, as all the dishes are awesome!
1
The food are wipe up quickly and top up slowly. Limited food choices, there are sashimi ( 3 different types), sushi, fried food, tempura, noodle and rice, limited dessert. By the time im done with my main meal and proceed to the dessert counter, there were only about 10% leftover cake...
1
We went for this buffet coz of the website kisekirestaurant.com.sg. The pics show variety of sashimi, seafood, and fish etc. but when we got there, the only seafoods were prawn and mussels. The sashimi were only salmons, salmons pork belly, octopus & Abalone. As you can see the pics. They don't have fish mackerel, no any steak, no other sashimi selections. Chicken karage no taste. Tempura was fine. And to be honest I never see such chocolate fountain in the pot, as u can see in the pic. No much choice of sushi also. Very disappointed seriously. I mean if u r going to shows us what u have in ur website, u should just provide as much as u can. Even u reduce one or two foods are ok. Will not recommend to my friends about this restaurant

Recently, my family and I revisited this restaurant (our last visit was in 2012 when I did my review in another food forum).Located on the 8th storey of Orchard Central, the restaurant seemed so familiar and unchanged from our previous visit. We arrived at 6.15pm on a weekday evening and it was not crowded as only a few tables were occupied (but later, it was quite crowded). We were ushered to our table by the window after making our payment by the friendly staff which was good as we could have some "bird eye's" view.After settling down, we helped ourselves with the food. As in 2012, the layout of the food counters seemed the same, with the main dishes in the center while desserts and fruits station on the other side of the restaurant. Ambience was nice and cosy, with the orange lightings make one feel "homely".In terms of variety wise, it was quite ok, ranging from cooked to grilled to deep fried and fresh food, they generally have that covering various kinds of meat, seafood (fresh prawns and mussels), sushi & sashimi (including abalone slices), pasta, pizzas, fried rice etc. They offer at least more than 40 kinds of food.While there were "hits and misses" of the food, generally it was satisfactory. Among all, we felt the grilled salmon fish head was good (but I found it a bit too salty and charred though it tasted quite nice), hotpot soup (you make your order by placing a clip at the order station and when it was ready, a staff would bring it to your table) and it was really flavourful and tasty, BBQ prawns very fresh, same as the sashimi.As for other deep fried or cooked items like spring rolls, nuggets, spare ribs, tepanyaki chicken chop, they were generally ok and passable though some of them seemed a bit overcooked or salty.You could also help yourself with the stir-fried vegetables and on the day of our visit, it was bean sprouts with mushrooms. It was quite nice though they would be gone quickly.Pastries and cakes were good (though one or two of these items were overly sweet), same as the ice cream, jelly and cut fruits of water melon and oranges. On the side, you could help yourself with both hot or cold beverages like coffee, cuppacino, iced peach tea or lemonade etc.Service wise was generally good as staff were friendly and polite and efficient in clearing our used plates and utensils. Most of the staff here were Filipinos, who by nature very warm and friendly. From the chef aspect, we noticed that some of the "popular" items were not replenished fast enough and one had to wait quite a while, such as the BBQ prawns or salmon fish head. Maybe these items need longer time to cook but they should have factored in the number of diners to minimize long waiting time.Generally it was quite great value for money, considering the variety of dishes offered and majority of them were good or satisfactory. Comparing to other similar Japanese buffet restaurants, its pricing is reasonable or on par with others but its location in downtown is a good pulling factor (besides generally nice food and service).Overall, we enjoyed our meal here and likely to revisit in the near future but surely not 5 years later! :

Instead of paying $26 per person for a Japanese set lunch, we decided on the Kiseki buffet option. It's like going to a Japanese food theme park where prepayment is required at the entrance and then you get an all access pass to rows upon rows of dishes. The food park rides are divided into sections with several choices. There was a cold section with sushi, sashimi, prawns, mussels, salad and cold soba. A teppanyaki section had pork, chicken and beansprouts. There were mackerel, salon head, sausage on skewers and chicken yakitori in the grill section.The tempura section contained prawns and vegetables. Oden, congee, miso soup, Japanese curry, steamed rice and a pork and vegetable hot pot could be found in the hot soup section. There were two cooked food sections with stir fried noodles, rice, pasta and mixed western dishes. Finally the dessert section and a station offering free flow of cold and hot beverages. The flavor profiles of the iconic Japanese dishes were as expected. Nothing tasted out of context but nothing really awoke the taste buds. The teppanyaki dishes were on the salty side. The price point and wide selection compensated for the cooking. You'll certainly leave this place a few kilos heavier.
1
Although the place closes at 10.00pm the staff packs up and stop replenishing the food @ 8.30pm!!!
Not worth the price when this is the service standard.
5
Compared to Todai,Kiseki is better in terms of food and price. Went there with 2 other friends, we enjoyed almost everything they served.
Sushi, sashimi, noodles, desserts, all perfect. Too bad they did not have fresh oysters.
3
For those who wants to try a large variety of Japanese food, this is a good place and reasonable priced. There are the usual sashimi, sushi, and fresh seafood. Also various salmon dishes, other Japanese food such as ramen, Chawanmushi, green tea ice cream, mocha.
5
Really amazing, the buffet is only under $30 per pax during lunch time of weekdays. There's a lot of choice, from veggies, seafoods (salmon - my fave - yum!), soups, meat (chicken, beef and pork), sushi, sashimi, etc .... and the dessert - all I can say is "WOW!" ... dont forget to try their "WASABI ICE CREAM" and "FRIED SALMON FISH HEAD". Undeniably - "AMAZING!" NOTE: pricing differs from weekdays to weekends or holidays as well as lunch and dinner.
3
Selection of food reasonable choice to select. Food taste average. Service since to be a bit of rude when everyone trying to rush in at 6pm sharp. Very curious that all table have the "reservation" sign on it. But never saw table occupy from the time we came in to left
3
Quite a good spread of choices, sashimi, seafood, grilled chicken, yakitori, chawanmushi etc. for the price we paid. Only thing is I waited very long for 2nd serving of chawanmushi but they did not refill it. Atmosphere is better then buffet town. We had a window seat which is awesome. Fruits choice is limited. Will be good if can serve banana, strawberries & grapes as these fruits will go well with the fondue chocolate besides just the marshmallow. Dessert wise is average. Chocolate gelato tasted good
3
Been to this restaurant several times. Quality is decent for price we paid. Good spread of food. We had snow crab today. Sashimi spread only has salmon and octopus. Used to have tuna and cooked prawns but missing today. Overall quality has dropped. Japanese food especially buffet is expensive in Singapore. Nothing below $50. We paid about $35++ per head for dinner. And 10% discount offered to students. Still consider value for money.
4
It's a Japanese buffet style restaurant, can seat up to 300 pxs.Lots of choices of Japanese food available - sushi, sashimi, tempura, pizza etc.Usually Long queue on weekend. We were there on a weekday nite around 7pm so it was ok but crowd start coming in around 7.30.Overall a good place if you like Japanese food.The service staff are fast in clearing the empty plates from the table
5
I liked this buffet. Whilst there were a lot of seating and customers, I'm informed the weekend is quieter. We had a great seat next to a window with a view over old Singapore houses.Food was plentiful, tasted delicious and the food was regularly replenished. Free flow drinks/coffee, made this a great lunchtime event. Tables were regularly inspected by staff with plates being removed once used. Attention to detail, lovely.This is obviously a popular place and for a first timer to Kiseki, a great eating place. I would recommend to others.If you find the above helpful, please acknowledg

I've been dining at Kiseki even before at Heeren. But was a bit disappointed when I went here last week for dinner and noticed that a lot has changed specially with the food quality. Few seafood options - we only had prawns and mussels, the tempura was a bit hard with a bit more batter, the sukiyaki soup tasted differently and spicy, the pizza were a bit burned. I would say that it is still ok but my previous dining experiences are way better. I liked their desserts though.Hope the management could look into these
1
All the foods are really bad and not fresh. Their best dish is the grilled fish, which has same quality as a normal foodcourt
4
Very reasonable price & serve varieties of food.
The food quality was actually quite good & server are very attentive & helpful.
3
Reasonable quality food here, but odd layout and we found quite expensive for what we got out of it... I.e. not particularly good value for kids or those without a huge appetite. Some of the more delicate options were definitely not great tasting as per expectation from a buffet joint. Go here if you have a big appetite and happy with generic fare.
4
My sister and a friend went here to binge on Japanese food and we were definitely not disappointed. They have a wide selection of seafood which I super love and the desert were great. I'd love to go back here but make sure to queue up early as there's going to be a long line of people waiting to go in especially on weekends. Quite expensive though so probably a once every month thing with the family
5
The vast array of food offered in this spaceous restaurant was unbelievable for the price you pay. I had been here about 3 times with a group of ladies for lunch and I was always sartisfied to the max after filling up my belly. I love their steamed prawns and fresh sushi and sashimi. Their salads were always fresh and crispy. The trays were always refilled fast and you can be rest assured you will always get the best quality of seafoods , meats, fruits in all categories. Highly recommended but book before you go since the place is always full during lunch and dinner
3
I went on a weekday lunch & it costs approx. $23 per person. To avoid disappointments either you make reservations thru their webpage 3 days in advance, or you should go after 1.30pm. The lunch ends @ 2.45pm. The service of their staff were unacceptable in my opinion as they were unfriendly and not alert. When I asked for drinking soup spoon, the manager (I supposed) just merely pointed to me the direction of the spoon and I had to still look for it on my own. When I walked up to the 'utensils' station, the spoon I wanted wasn't there. Most of the items were not refilled. But one positive thing was that the person clearing our plates was very efficient and quick. He cleared our plates within 5 mins after we place it at the edge of the table. That made our meal slightly more enjoyable. Lastly, the food was pretty decent. Nothing special, but it was just enough for me and my friend. There wasn't a wide variety of sushi but they had the popular ones that most people consume. There were also a lot of fried food, like ebi tempura, nuggets, takoyaki ball etc. Look forward to seeing a lot of fresh sashimi too! All in all, I would recommend this place if you're not too picky about the variety of food choices (as you'll be disappointed!!) & go with an open mind. Do not have very high expectations, you pay for what you get! It was value for money.

My 3rd time there but first time bringing my family members. They enjoyed themselves. Good buffet with fresh seafood and some cooked dishes like tohu, fried udon, etc. We enjoyed the grilled salmon fishhead most. The children loved the tempura, chicken chunks and of course the ice-cream.Really value for money with such a spread with adults paying $19.80++ and children at $12.80++ for lunch. Planning to go again in Sep

This is my first visit to this restaurant as I was invited to lunch by my friends who were celebrating their 25 wedding anniversary. The ambience of the restaurant is quite good we had a table which gives us a good view of Killiney Road. However, from the moment I stepped into the restaurant till the time we left, all the serving staff whom we encountered wore gloomy and stressed faces. I didn't witness any of the staff smiling. Having said that, they were efficient in clearing out table and replenishing the food at the buffet station. The food is quite good and the variety is acceptable for the price we paid. No complaint about that. It would be good if the management start to focus on good service as they already have good ambience and good food which are value for money. Staff are already efficient but need to give this restaurant a friendlier environment for diners to enjoy a wholesome experience.
5
Very Extensive Buffet . With almost 30 dishes to choose from . They have everything Japanese in their buffet except for one , Ramen. Don't miss out on the seafood , particularly the lobster . Spacious seating , attentive and friendly staff , including the supervisor . Food tastes excellent . Moderate pricing making it good value for money. Having the wasabi and black sesame variant of their gelato is also worth trying . Just fortunate we had prior reservations , because it can be chaotic lining up waiting for your turn 
3
Lots of people, i tried the lunch and dinner - enjoyed bother meals. Do the reservation , check out the special theme , My family likes to hot pot and kids love the chawanmushi. Desserts tend to go fast near the end of buffet with limited top up. Overall experience isalright and we will go again
3
Nice selection and resonance price. Nice place to try out all Japanese styles. Nice service. Bit crowded seating. Desert is not much and slow served
2
Their tempura is very oily. The sauce are not seasoned well. Limited choice of Sashimi and maki. Not as what we have expected it.
4
Really only went here as all others were full, so thought we would give it a go.The food quality was actually quite good, but many many younger people putting huge amounts on their plates made it hard to actually try a range of food.. Some people were just amazingly greedy, so maybe even serving people would make it better for all.The range was actually quite good, the price was a little high, but as I say the ability to get a fair sized meal was hindered by the greedy and quite rude people.. SIgn of the times I think.I would not return, but more as other are better value, better service and better price
4
Wide selection of food , chicken beef and pork katsu were delicious , so were the yakitori and so were the zaru soba . All this for only $23 ! Only complain was that the salmon sashimi weren't fresh other wise , the food was delicious 
3
The variety of food available was decent for the price.As for what I ate and a personal rating for the food I had:Chawanmushi: 4/5Cha soba: 3/5 (noodles were soggy)Yakitori: 4/5Takoyaki: 3.5/5Ebi: 4/5Seafood nabe: 3.5/5Tempura: 3/5 (the tempura is prepared in big batches, so they became soggy very easily)Edamame: 4/5Green tea ice cream: 4/5Vanilla ice cream: 4/5Mango ice cream: 4/5Rum&raisin cake: 3/5 (not much flavour)The staff were very attentive and friendly, who also gave diners their space, which I really appreciate and it helped to improve the dining experience

in 2014 was my first visit in this restaurant when i came to singapore, always come tothis restaurant when i had my trip in singapore, always satisfied with the food, they have wide spread of japanese food, include the desert, i think this is cheapest price of all japanese buffet in singapore, as i try to find another place like this, and still this is the cheapest one, really amazing food in town, really worht i
1
This is my very 1st review which i am giving 1 star to a restaurant and i hope it would be my very lastIn summary, the food was tasted horrible and the overall price was so expensive that i felt scammed by the restaurantLONG POST AHEADMy friends and i wanted to go hai di lao for dinner at 313 somerset on a weekday however we had to wait for 2 hours thus we decided to go kiseki for dinner since there was no queueIf i had to really find something good about the restaurant, the cashier is friendly... THATS ALL ! thats the only good thing about the restaurant (even the person collecting the plates looked like she was either sick of her job or life)Initially we thought that there would be a huge variety of food since the place seems big... however the variety of food was only so-so and the only thing i was interested in was the hotpot since there were posters which advertised this thingAs we begin taking the food, i knew that it would be bad as the shisamo and tempura felt really soggy. The variety of sushi was pretty pathetic and the sashimi didnt seem fresh (i guess everyone was afraid of raw food after the news)So we took the first bite and i really felt like i was eating dog food (i tasted dog food before and i couldnt find any difference between it, except that i had to pay more for this)In an attempt to 'salvage' the situation, we ordered the miso chicken hotpot and seafood hotpot... because... hey, what can go wrong with hotpot ?But we were soooo wrong when the 2 pots of soup (or should i say boiling water) came... the fire seems impressive but sadly, that was the only impressive thing. The seafood hotpot tasted so fishy and the chicken miso had a tinge of bitter tasteIronically, the dessert was warm... LOL... imagine the main dishes were cold yet the desserts were warm... how ironic is that ?Despite being a buffet, we didnt eat till we were full and found it highly unsatisfyingIn the end, the only best dish at that place is the free flow of soft drinks... everything was seriously bad and my friends said that we should never go back to this place ever again as it cost us $34 per pax and paying $34 for dog food is just insane!The existence of this restaurant in orchard is definitely an insult to other restaurants around that area and using the word 'horrible' to describe this restaurant is an understatementPS my friends and i went to hai di lao in the end for a second round to have some food meant for human

Went here for dinner before Christmas eve 24Dec. The waiting line was outrageous and made us really hungry. So when it was our time to eat we were really excited. The receptionist or cashier was a Filipina so we didnt have a hard time speaking in English. Crab and crayfish was not really tasty as I think it was only boiled. But it's fresh. Other foods were tasty like the sashimi and oysters and prawns but I was not able to try all the food. overall it's O
2
Spend almost $100 for a Christmas dinner for 2 persons but I was quite disappointed with the quality and the choices. What I donâ€™t understand is why are there still so many people queuing up? Most likely I will not be coming back in the near future
3
I feel a bit bad about giving this place an average rating, the lunch we had was fairly adequate. But objectively you cannot give it more than 3 stars. The food is so-so, the selection is lean (almost no sushi), and the price is on the high side for the quality
3
Quite disappointed their quality & service are dropped compare to one year ago I visited especially the salmon, tasteless & not very fresh. Replenishment of food is slow. It is not worth it for dinner.
2
I should say that you get what you pay for. The quality of the food was low and extremely basic. Lots of fried food and little variety. With all the options available in Singapore, I will definitely not go back to this restaurant.
5
Made a reservation via SMS and got a quick response with a confirmation.
Food was great, there was Salmon and Yellowtail Sashimi along with various others, will definitely visit again.
3
Quite nice buffet at pretty decent price. Nothing fantastic but food are fresh and service is quite good.
4
Reservation was easy. Many seats around for booking.
Variety of Japanese food was moderate for the money.
Staff clears the table very frequently and quietly.
Closing at 10PM helps to gather friends longer for chitchat.
3
It's consider cheap for the amount we paid for Japanese Buffet due to promotion. Even with the promotion rate that we paid for, I'm not sure is it worth the price. The service is not that good as our table are piled up with empty plates. The plates given are all small plates and each time you can only take a small portion. This easily piled up a lot of plates.The refill of food is very slow, a lot of time when I pass by I'm not able to get the food I want as it's always empty. When I moved on to dessert section, I only see empty plates with about 3-5 pieces of cake left on the whole dessert range. And the queue for Ice Cream is quite long (maybe there isn't any other option for them to choose). The fruits section only left with half bowlful of watermelon. Ends up I did not have anything for my dessert

Looking for a Japanese buffet with a wide variety of fresh sashimi, sushi, and delectable desserts? Well folks, save your money and look elsewhere.We visited Kiseki for dinner on a weekend and, as such, had expectations of the best of what the restaurant had to offer (the price for the weekend buffet dinner definitely reflected this expectation). Instead, we were disappointed with the lack of choices and sub-par quality of the dishes on offer:-The grilled lamb chops and steak were tough and cold-The sashimi on offer consisted of only salmon and salmon belly-Made-to-order stations only offered nabemono and stir fried beansprouts-Shrimp and vegetable tempura had batter as tough as stale chips-The crab legs were almost as thin as those of the reef crabs you often see running through the rocky tidepools - hardly any meat-Ice cream was not regularly replenishedThe front line staff worked very hard to clean tables (thumbs up to them). Unfortunately, some of the food counter staff began clearing up dishes/desserts before closing.I really wanted to love Kiseki, as I've heard good things about them. Unfortunately, we were let down that night
1
The title speaks for itself.Food variety is weak, sashimi slices are too thinly sliced, sushi choices are pathetic, deep fried processed nibbles (rather than substantial food) all taste of starch, quality of cooking stations are poor, food replenishment rate is slow during peak hours, staff keep away ice cream condiments prior to 10pm closing time. At $40 per head for dinner, this is simply unacceptable.Used to be so excellent, now just rock bottom. Would not return
3
Enjoyed our dinner at Kiseki. Choices were not too plenty, but what they did offer, was satisfactory as food was good. During our time of visit, they had the alaskan crab legs included at the buffet. Better to call and reserve in advance as it can get full
3
Best to make a reservation here because a queue forms even for those with reservations, about 20 minutes before opening. Walk ins are served AFTER those with reservations.The price is low and therefore it is good value. As for the food, I would say some hits and many misses of mass produced food.HITS: Sashimi was fresh and had abalone, Shishamo and Salmon Head was good, A few good Jap desserts,chawanmushi was quite OK..MISSES: Soba was bland, hotpot was very average, wrong type of soy sauce for sashimi, most hot dishes were very average, tempura batter did not have the right texture, yakitori was average. meat dishes were so so And this place seems to attract those who want to pay S$23 and think that taking 500g of sashimi a person and grabbing as much as they can at the expense of others, is fair game.... Really, if you want to see uncivilized behaviour, come here - not a pretty sight at all.. But, do you expect any different for the price
4
the food is just average but considering that it is in the central area and offers a pretty good view, this place should be ideal for young tourists and students
3
There are nothing special for japanese buffet, but only you can see the good interior with recycles materials.
3
Been here few times, but only if they have snow crabs and if I am craving for buffet.. But nothing so fantastic about the food or the place, just an averaged buffet dining place.
1
Buffet dining at its worse. Nasty food: dried out sushi, gloopy everything else. Uncleared tables everywhere, litter all over the floor. It was like eating in a fast food restaurant except it cost you $40.
Spend your money elsewhere.
5
Paid S$23.30 nett for lunch, you get over 100s of items. That is the best value for a Japanese buffet. From sashimi, sushi, large cold prawns, teppanyaki, yakitori, tempura, pizza n varieties of desserts and of course good coffee. Just can't complain.
5
Took on the 19. 90 lunch buffet. Think everything Japanese and more. Sushi. Cold cuts. Teppanyaki. Hot dishes. Soups. Grill. Skewers. Drinks spread and desserts. Either go early to queue, opens at 1130 or make a reservation. Try it once. You'll be back for more.
3
If you want to have a cheap Japanese buffet, you have give Kiseki a try. But don't expect too much. They provide quite a lot of different choices. But the quality is not really that good. It's good for a group of friends to have a casual dinner
2
A cheaper alternative to many other buffets in Singapore, but you're better off just not going for a buffet.Labelled a Japanese buffet restaurant, the dishes aren't really Japanese. They put in some ingredients to the dish that resemble Japanese ingredients, and call it Japanese cuisine. If you were Japanese and went there, you would probably be upset at their representation of Japanese cuisine.Variety was poor, mostly fried food. The ebi tempura looked so skinny, you might not believe they used real prawns for it. Nothing of much quality or value. You'll fill your stomach with lacklustre dishes.The sashimi station at least had a good quantity, so you can alternatively just have a sashimi buffet and forego all the other dishes (but even then there are way better sashimi buffets out there).I guess if you're on a budget and not picky about what you eat, this place might be brought up for consideration. But if you want to have proper Japanese food, avoid this place

~Jimmy recommended this place at Orchard Central, we parked at Orchard Gateway Level 5, make the turn left before entering Orchard Central carpark, sharp right that spot always available parking. We took a shortcut out to the spiral driveway and back up the steps into the life lobby for Orchard Central, took the goods lift up to Level 8, walk thru 2 doors and straight across the pathway to Kiseki.. um easy :)~You gotta have a reservation or be prepared to queue, we just jumped ahead with ours, you've to prepay and get a ultra violet kinda stamp on the back of your hand to get in~The spread is huge, everything you can think of Japanese, it's prolly served. There are should numbered clips to have food cooked ala minute and served to your table. you gotta go find those standing cards with the dish written on it and clip that card.~The most sought after dish is the grilled salmon fish head, ladies at my table loved the collagen portions~This is not a place for couples or business, unless you're really hungry or really cheap
4
Been to this restaurant a couple of times. Every time....I still do enjoy the food they prepared. The grill salmon head, cold prawn, sashimi, yakitori are great. They also have pizza and the desserts are great. Highly recommended especially for lunch buffet. It is value for the price!!! Best to call for reservation or you have come early to avoid long waiting Q

This is one of the worst Jap buffet that I've been. The food spread was very limited and the quality of the food is below average. Definitely not as many items listed on their website.Seriously, it's a matter of "You get what you pay for". At $32.80++ for weekday dinner, it's really cheap. Most of the food in the chafing dish were cold, except for those cooked when you order. A lot of the items were not replenished so you keep staring at empty plates/bowls and chafing dish. Seafood was limited to prawns. Service was lousy too. We asked the staff behind the ice cream counter if there was any more green tea ice cream as the container was empty. She ignored us and walked away. Definitely our 1st and last visit here

I have been there a couple of times and I can say they had a very big variety of food for the value. On my last visit I was very disappointed with the sushi variety as they only had salmon, squid, shrimp, and one other dish. The way the sushi was cut and placed in the dishes was very unappealing and we ordered a soup which took about 25 minutes to arrive. The quality has dropped from their previous location that they moved from which was in the basement. I can also say that it has lost its prestige from that of before. And Finally after eating there this last time we got terrible tummy aches which really brought the ratings of this place to the very bottom. I don't think I will be going back there again.

This is one of the most enjoyable Japanese buffet we had for a long time. Very good spread and at a very very reasonable price. Very crowded though. So I would advise you to call ahead to reserve your table. Lunch starts at 11:30am and ends at 3pm. Enjoy

Went for a dinner on Monday with friends. I am big fan of Japanese buffets and this one was one of the best I have had in Singapore. The spread was huge, the quality of food was very good for a buffet, the sashimi was above average if not the best and the desserts were very good. The ambiance was nice but despite getting a table next to the window we could not see anything outside because of the reflection on the glass. Definitely recommend it for the food, probably not for the view

I've been in Kiseki several times and I must say that, Kiseki, the MEGA Japanese Buffet at Mini Prices - is very true! Kiseki sticked to their company slogan. You will definitely enjoy their buffet spread, from appetizers to desserts, raw and cooked food, hot & cold beverages. I enjoyed a lot their seafood section. =) The staffs are very attentive in replenishing the food, and even cleaning your table with all the used/finished plate. The only thing I must commented is regarding their space. It feels like a bit over crowded, they indeed maximize the space. And to avoid disappointment, better to make early reservations even on weekdays =

Having tried numerous buffets in Singapore, I still think this offers the most value for money. The sashimi is fresh and replenished constantly and there is a good variety of cooked food. Pizzas, in Japanese flavours, are also available for those who want something other than Asian dishes. You need to make reservations here, long queues are a common sight at this restaurant

first of all, the line here especially on weekends are just crazy. best to place a reservation days ahead. they only accept 30% of their diners via reservations on a day. they are open until 1030pm on saturdays. now to the main part - the food! i just loved their sashimi - thick cut, really fresh and very tasty. i could just swallow them all non stop. other japanese dishes were ok. nothing stood out except for that black curry which is my first time to try. oh and they have mochi for dessert! price for dinner on a saturday is 35 SGD per person. they are very attentive in collecting used plates. the ambiance is good although it feels very busy as most of the time there are a lot of people getting food. i would definitely eat here again when im back in SG

Catch up with a few friends for dinner at this venue. It's my first visit and surprise to see that there was a long queue waiting outside the restaurant. But thank God, we did a reservation and so my first advise is to make sure that you reserve a table before visiting.The restaurant serves a great variety of japanese food and even Alaskan crab. However, I would only rate their ingredients as average. The sashimi presented had a funny cut (short and thick) but they were pretty ok. The rest of the items like yakitori and chicken nuggets tasted exactly like those which you can get at supermarkets. The beef that we ordered was also over cooked and too hard for our liking. The quality of the beef is really average.The good thing is their price tag. Would not burn a hole in our pockets

I love Kiseki. I come every time I'm in Singapore - it's a sushi lovers dream. Fresh sashimi, sushi and amazing Japanese food that's never ending, unlimited drinks, what more could you want? I love spending an hour or more in this place and just having a lazy lunch. The dessert bar is also awesome with things like wasabi and sesame icecream! Love love love it. No complaints. The only reason I didn't go on this current trip is because I'm pregnant and the plates of fresh sashimi that I'm not allowed to eat is too much of a temptation! Will definitely be back with baby in tow next time.Go on a weekday for cheaper entry and make sure you book in advance to avoid the long queues

Kindly reserve before visiting. Place very full. Great spread of variety. Coffee and tea is available too. They use Dilmah for tea. Come with empty stomach..

The black curry was to look for. Yakitotri could've been served with more variety. Shrimp lovers are sure winners here. The desserts ccould still be improved though its already good. Avoid Saturdays.

From The Heeren to Orchard Central!
This restaurant is still on top of my list, its affordable price and the buffet spread.
I still prefer their type of buffet over the ala-carte buffet.

Kiseki is on the 8th floor of Orchard Central, less than 5-minutes-walk from the Somerset MRT. We were 3rd in line (with no reservations) at 10:50AM, not knowing Kiseki opened at 11:30AM. The line quickly grew before our eyes. Amazing lunch crowd on a Tuesday. First of all, for S$23.30, inclusive of taxes & service charge, I'm just going to eat and enjoy the moment. Use the little pins with your table number to order different dishes. Soda, tea & coffee are unlimited, too. Yes, there are better more expensive buffets. Kiseki is nothing to write home about, but it was fun for us:

I suppose you get what you pay for. This is a one time shot, I wouldnt go back and encourage anyone who reads this to spend their money elsewhere ... the shabu place across the hall is cheaper and better.Once you get in, which itself is a challenge, the food is sub-par. Oily, greasy, cold and really not that great. Limited options and the place has hygiene issues too. The staff walk around with these carts to clear food, and so you could have a cart sitting next to your table with a stack of dirty plates and food.Kinda horrible place ... price for Singapore is OK, thats the only saving grace. Avoid

The place is always crowded, make sure u booked your table in advance. If you live outside singapore you can make an online reservation, the website is also very helpful to describe the restaurant.I love japanese food and i love kiseki for its variety and reasonable price

You have to search this place out, although they do advertise on the main floor of their shopping mall. But, they are on the EIGHTH floor. Take the elevators to the left of the entrance from Orchard Road. If you elect to take the escalators, it will be a looooong ride up.There are several restaurants on the eighth floor, and this is the most expensive at US$28 (incl tax) per person for lunch. About $3 more for dinner. It was also the busiest, (there was a small lineup) with 90% Asian faces which I consider to be a very good sign. We went for lunch and found the food to be fresh, plentiful and verrrry tasty. There was only a couple of sushi dishes, but many sashimi choices, but for $28 I want to eat lots of expensive fresh fish, and less cheap rice. There were also a number of Japanese curry dishes, tempuras, noodle dishes, and other delights. They also had pizza for those in the family who insist on N.A. food. But the REAL treat was the sashimi. Good variety and all fresh. Go for the food, not the view.Would I eat there again? In a heartbeat

In Singapore, a buffet with so much spread and some premium items, this was just awesome for $20. Absolutely amazing for the price. We went on a Friday lunch and had a great time. The price increases on the weekend but I also believe there are more items in the buffet on the weekend. I tried so many items for the first time and was impressed. A great place to go as a group. I would surely recommend this to anybody who wants to have some nice food. I have heard that you should avoid the weekend becuase there are just too many people. We went early on Friday but towards the end of our lunch, there were a lot of people and I guess it was difficult to cater to so many people. If you can plan ahead or have a bigger group, surely recommend making a reservation and putting in a deposit

Had lunch buffet to celebrate friend's birthday and would recommend if looking for a good spread of Japanese dishes, definitely worth the money. Kiseki is very popular & there is even a queue line for those who have made reservations on weekends so go early or go 1 1/2 hr before buffet time ends to avoid the crowd.Enjoyed the endless serving of raw seafood that we could help ourselves with; Salmon Sashimi, Ebi, Tuna, Chilled Prawns, Half-Shell Mussels and there were a few of the common sushi available for one of their sections. All time favourite Japanese Oden, Chawanmushi, Soba and many others are available for folks who are not into seafood. Have enjoyed the option where I could order grilled food & the chefs do it on the spot for me; love their marinated Teriyaki chicken.The fruits and desserts section is alright, its nothing amazing as the main spread is what my friends and I would return for. If you're looking to hold a party with lots laughter, this is definitely the place. Free & easy casual dining

Seemingly a good spread of Basic Japanese Food...dessert selection was a bit disappointed though...for me, yes, they do have ice cream, waffles, selection of pastries and a mini fondue, but, personally, I feel, the looks and the quality don't seem to be tempting to the eyes and taste buds, maybe, focus more on quality than variety as I believe, don't need a big spread, just a moderate quality that will do, let the variety part plays more on the main selection area...just a though..
