Great value for money...
ordered the rice and the wrap both were yum! We ordered home delivery very and the wrap was much better than some wraps I have been ordering from better known names in the past.

As this was my second time here, quality kebab roll. For a light dinner, but filling for me. A good recommendation for all students of Kaplan, and everyone.

This place does good quality food, but remember it is a kebab outlet, so don't take any dates here!
Price is really good for the traveller who is tired of paying out $40 for something to eat every day

The meat and the wrap was dry... the overall taste was rather bland.. I think it was not worth for the price.. there are other better options nearby.

located in Wilkie Edge office complex, EPIK is a pocket friendly and delicious kebab place. The meat is tender and lightly spiced. You can curate your kebab roll/sandwich/rice to include fries, fried egg + add different sauces , or even just take only kebab meat. have been here dozens of times for lunch and this place is one of our favorites

The staffs are friendly when they were attending me.I ordered rolled up kebab with mixed chicken and beef. The food was awesome and I didn't have to wait long for the food to be served

Finally tried this place after many friends recommended me this place. The price was high for a fast food with no seats available with no fries and no drinks. Meat was ok but there nothing special. Same goes for the bread. There are better fast food and better kebab place in Singapor

Just had another meal at EPIKebabs recently. What sets EPIK apart is its portion-size - and given its well-marinated meat, that is definitely welcome! Be it their rice, rolls, salads or sandwiches - you can be sure to look forward to a hearty meal.Their food is affordable too - $6 for their main items, and just a $2 add-on for their combo (which consists of chilli chips and a drink). I especially enjoy their rice, which has been cooked with a lovely mix of spices. That, together with their meat [you can choose between chicken or beef; or have both if you really can't decide ] and combo make for a really satisfying meal. Can't wait to have my next fix of EPIK!

Kebab is one of my favourite foods, and EPIKebabs definitely have THE best kebabs in Singapore. In fact, having travelled the world - even to 'kebab hotspots' like Turkey, Egypt, and UK - I can truly say that the kebabs at EPIK are quite epic.They're definitely value-for-money, considering the size of their servings! My favourite is the the Chicken Sandwich. I'm not sure what secret ingredients they put in it, but the bread itself has a distinct taste and goes really well with the marinate. And if you're a sucker for presentation, they have one of the best meat stacks I have ever seen. They are also probably the the cleanest, most hygienic kebab stalls you'll ever see.This is why EPIKebabs is the only place I go to get my dose of kebab when in Singapore

In the past, I would generally avoid kebabs because I hate the thick and floury wrap. EPIKebabs is different. The wrap is light and toasted crisp. On top of that the meat is well marinated and well balanced with lettuce and hummus. Recommended for a quick lunch or post-workout refuel stop
