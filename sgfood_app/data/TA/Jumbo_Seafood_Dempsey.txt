Manage to get the table after arrival
The staff is politic and the food is great.
Although the waiting time for the food is pretty Long but it worth to wait
5
Never ever fails you..been there for countless times!! Amazing food as usual! A must to go everytime
4
We used the calendar discount for jan and ate an incredible 2 kg worth of prawns between hubby and me. It was fabulous. Service was too!
3
some orders was missed out. Need to re-order and long waiting time. Otherwise, all other service was good
5
It was really wonderful night with friends in Jumbo! The food, the crab and the service were all good as every time I came! The staff gave us very useful suggestion when we ordered food, and we just finished all the dishes without any leftover. We really appreciated it very much

Went there with my auntie and uncle from the Philippines due to the positive feedbacks I’m reading about the place, but when we go there and see for ourselves, the place has nothing much to offer aside from the below average dishes (but instagrammable) and a but pricey as well. The food’s taste may be subjective, but what made this review this low are the servers at the place itself, rude, unprofessional, and it’s very obvious that they are not enjoying what they’re doing. Not even smiling at all during our entire 1 hour + of stay. NEVER AGAIN
1
A shame!! Une honte!! They have to learn how to cook a pepper crabIls doivent apprendre à cuisiner un pepper crabPlease choose an other place if you cannot make up your mind De grâce choisissez un autre restau si vous hésitez Merciiiiii pour vous!!!!

The food here is not bad, but not as good as I remember when I used to visit more frequently a few years ago. However, the customer service here is non-existent, with rude waitresses and slow service. Even when charged for two drinks we didn't order there was no apology. But what really got me is the price. For a group a of eight with no alcohol the bill came to 700 SGD. For $88 per head I had one prawn, one piece of pepper crab, a bowl of fried rice and a couple pieces of Kai lan. That was it! We all ate about the same. Left feeling totally ripped-off. Never again
5
I went there with my daughter especially for the chilli mud crab & we weren’t disappointed . We chose one dish that was too hot for us to eat and they kindly swapped it for a rice with shallots & then didn’t charge us for the original dish. Great steamed broccoli with garlic sauce. Great customer service, very friendly and efficient. Afterwards they called a taxi for to take us back to our hotel.

Chilli crab is the best and most Singaporean dish to have in Singapore. I like to take out of town friends here for Chilli crab because it's my favorite spot for it. This location in Dempsey hill is a nice little green oasis away from the crazy hustle of The Central area
5
Although the chilli crab is their signature dish, we enjoyed the black pepper crab as the meat is tender with a good flavour. Our family fave place for good black pepper crabs!
5
Was here for business lunch and Jumbo is always good for such lunches. Service was tip top and food was delicious
2
The reservation doesnt show indoor or outdoor. End up having dinner at outdoor, which wasnt our prefer choice.
4
Jumbo at Dempsey never fail to deliver the food, in terms of quality and service. Black pepper crabs were amazing. The service was great too. Kudos.
5
This restaurant never disappoints. Despite it being busy, food is tasty and service excellent. Cindy is an excellent service staff and my family and I really enjoyed the pepper crabs, chili crabs, scallops, etc
3
I selected Jumbo restaurant for my 60th birthday celebration. However, the food was far from satisfactory. The 2 "mid size" crabs we ordered did not feel like the 1.3kg weight the waitress declared, and taste of the chili sauce is rather plain. It just did not deserve the $101 per crab price. We found a 3/4 inch long whte worm (or caterpillar) in the Chinese Spinach dish, and returned the dish. I would suppose there might be overlook when they clean the vegetables before cooking. But 3/4 inch is not difficult to spot
5
We had the $538 set meal which comprised 1) Australian lobster done two ways; sashimi and cooked in a natural double boiled soup. Ingredients given to add to the soup were pok choy, enoki mushrooms and miscellaneous vegetables. 2) chilli crab (2 medium sized crabs); we ordered extra man tou to dip into the gravy - yummy. 3) bamboo clams with vermicelli and garlic - very well cleaned without any sandy taste. 4) asparagus with scallops. 5) steamed soon hock HK style. This was a live fish which tasted fabulous. 6) remnants of the lobster was cooked with glass vermicelli in claypot. All the umami from the lobster seeped into the glass noodles. Excellent! 7) two desserts comprising a) mango pudding and b) rock melon in fruit juice. This was so refreshing after a hearty meal. We loved it that the restaurant doesnâ€™t charge us for water! Seating tip: ask for a table inside the restaurant. The outside seating appears dark plus the crowd queing for a table could overflow into the seating area. We noticed this as it was raining.
4
Location was good and comes with free parking as Long you can find slots. Food wise some are nice some are alright. I would give some suggestions that you can order the salted egg yolk deshelled prawns - cook with real salted egg and the spinach toufu with the many types of over flowing mushrooms which comes with wok hey taste :)
4
Had a great seafood lunch with my family. We ordered a set menu for 4 for our family of 2 Adults and 3 teens, and added another chilli crab. The food was more than enough for all of us and tasted very food. In particular, the black pepper crab in the set menu was very fresh. The only not so great comment about the food is the chilli crab that tasted not so fresh and the sauce was a bit too sweet.
5
Went there to try the Chili Crab as it was recommended to us by friends.The restaurant is nice, both the inside and the outside areas. Service was good.The food was absolutely fantastic, worth the trip.The Chili Crab is an experience. I asked for it to be not too spicy and we were accomodated. It had a little bit of a kick, but mild while still flavorful.We also had fried prawns with a cereal coat (very special), seafood noodles and some sea bass cubes in a tangy sauce.After all price was reasonable - in the context of Singapore being super expensive.I cannot recommend enough
5
When we go to SG, Jumbo Seafood Dempsey is one of very important places we have to go!
Chili crab and Blackpepper crab are both very good taste. Mee go reng is also very good, very spicy, unforgettable!
5
Great service by Andrew and his team , food unique and different
Welcoming staff, very attentive, great selection of wine and beverages
Efficient
4
We have not been to the Jumbo in Dempsey before and was pleasantly surprised. The service and food was a lot better than the East Coast branch. Chilli and Pepper Crab out of this world. Will definitely be back for another visit.
4
We ate at Dempsey Hill. The food was delicious!! The Wine was totally overpriced and they were out of the House wine and didn’t have another one to offer at that price.
5
Wonderful holiday treat - though it was a western festival - with Singapore National-Dish! Every trip to Jumbo Dempsey is perfect, Chili crab always at it's high standard, steamed local lobster is amazing. Staff are so nice.
4
Always good to be back at this place, a must go for chilli crab lovers. Had the Alaskan, huge - yes, we were warned the price would be hefty - but worth every bite.
4
Food was excellent as usual. However the waitress attending to us was quite forgetful on small requests like a glass of water. The atmosphere was unfortunately marred by a loud and noisy group of 10 or so seated next to our table.
5
Went for a xmas lunch with 6pax, ordered 1 chili crab, 1 pepper crab, kangkong, salted egg prawns, half spring chicken, 20 man tous, sweet yam paste per pax, 2 siam coconut, mee goreng.... bill came out to $330. Expensive ?? Well some things are worth paying for. Jumbo seafood not only serves great food but the service crew are all excellent , it was a crowded xmas day but we were very well taken care of . Thanks Jumbo 
5
Our favorite to enjoy Pepper Crab and Chili Crab at Dempsey. We have been to the original Jumbo Seafood on East Coast too which is also special but we prefer Dempsey.Great place for family when you have kids and put on your bib to go for the Crab. Lunchtime on the weekend is our timing we go, be early enough as they are busy
5
Invited my friends from Hongkong to have dinner at Jumbo. It was very crowded thus extremely noisy. We were seated inside with air con and itâ€™s a little cramp with tables placed close to each other. We had to raise our voices in order to be heard. We ordered the set of 4 which was rather reasonable. The crab was a little small but delicious. We ordered extra fried buns to dip into the Chilli crab sauce. Yummy.
2
We went to have dinner and ordered the black paper crab, chilli crab, drunken prawns, fried rice and scallop on fried yam. The food seemed to be re-heated food pre-produced at central kitchen, especially the two crab dishes.
4
Excellent staff, especially the manager and her team waiting on us. Friendly with great initiative, provide advice on our orders, good communication skills,. Prompt and pleasant service despite the crowd.
4
Nice place in dempsy area with seafood. It was visiting in a few mths, and always serve good quaility foods.
5
Just a simple lunch with family after some shopping in the area. Child friendly. Food was awesome as well.
5
I’ve never enjoyed dinner as much as I enjoy this place
Ordered a lot of starters and black pepper crap and I had the best dinner I can imagine
5
This restaurant can deliver very yummy food. However a bit pricey. For family gathering, this could be the one to looking into.
4
I love food at Jumbo as they taste delicious and doesn't make me suffer from bad thirst after eating them. However, my personal opinion is the price is a little too high.
4
Good seafood in Singapore. You should call & reserve place before coming here, or you may need to queue waiting for your table. Very impressive with crab here (come from Canada ?), it's very big. However, just my personal thinking, it's not the best way to enjoy seafood according to its size. The restaurent is located on a very intetesting hill as well
4
We loved our recent dinner here. The Chlli Crab is quite special - really meaty with divine sauce. Other dishes such as prawns, lamb, egg fried rice and beef pepper sauce are really quite good too. Service is pretty good - well meaning but not truly polished. Fret not, you're here for the seafood
4
Celebrated friendâ€™s bday & we ordered steamed crab, cream my crab, drunken prawns, yam ring with scallops & steamed fish. The seafood was very fresh & value for $ We enjoyed the food & service sss very attentive too! My only gripe is that they charge corkage fee of 30 for the first bottle & subsequent bottles at 15 each. They could have waive it off for members like myself :(
4
we go to JUMBO for the crab.but the spicy crab didn't surprise us.we all a little bit upset.however,the shrimp with oatmeal was awazing and awesome.it's so delicious.we ate it all.we love it,
5
Always love Jumbo's crabs, one of the the freshest. And the sauce, pretty unbeatable, both taste wise and texture
5
Great food and not just crab including Alaskan King Crab (my fav). All dishes were delicious!! Go for the set menus they have.
5
Went for lunch on a weekend and it wasnt crowded. Service was fast and the staff did well in taking care of us. Food was delicious too. Would definitely come back again.
3
I had very good memories of my last three visit to Jumbo restaurant in the last three years, but this time I found the food ordinary. The service more and more commercial and the staff too pushy to sell expensive food (like Alaska crab) .....instead to suggest and explain the different dishes. They try to trick you claiming there is a special 50% discount...but they not tell you that, the Alaska crab, cost a fortune any how!! Sorry Jumbo....this time "you" do not let me excite at all. Too commercial ...
3
Went for dinner with foreign guest and found that the food quality and taste is not as good as before. They tried to hard sell their Alaska crab to us with 50% discount but no mentioned of price. So far East Coast outlet is my best choice for Jumbo as far as food quality and consistency in taste
4
Our party of ten recently visited Jumbo at Dempsey on a very busy Friday night. Fortunately our table was ready at the allotted time and we were promptly attended to by the busy yet attentive staff. The various dishes ordered were all served hot and at regular intervals. This included the pepper and chilli crabs as well as a plain crab which was quickly converted to another chilli crab upon request. Very impressive.All in all a very enjoyable and tasty meal. We will return
3
Have reserved online and the restaurant was busy. The waiter was trying to push us to order the Alaska crab saying that the regular one was only ~800g each, not enough for two. Then when we insisted on the regular one, he said that the crab could be 1.3kg and at the end, charged us for 1.5kg. Other than this, the service was good, the food were typical Cantonese style with the famous chili crab. The Chili crab was a mix of bit sweet and spice, special buy may not have me try 2nd time with the price of ~US$60/kg.
5
I've tried Jumbo Seafood based on recommendations from locals. They are part of a chain, but I was told the Dempsey Hill restaurant is the nicest. Indeed, I liked that part of the city very much. Food was amazing, I had the black pepper crab and lobster salad. I didn't like the salad, but the crab was fantastic. My friend tried the Drunken Prawns and the seafood rice, both were excellent. Do book a table in advance, the place is very busy- we had to wait for 45 mins to get a table
4
Food was great and service at our table was great. But the one who received us at the entrance told us the air-con section was already fully booked and directed us to the open air tables instead. But throughout the lunch hour, I don't see anyone being brought into the air-con section at all. We had to sweat it out while eating our chilli crab in the hot afternoon sun. There were at least 4 other dining groups who were told the same 'story' by the receiving staff
3
Food was not bad but service was soso.
Staff just going through motion when they serve.
Service can be improved
5
Good price for set dinner. Nice ambience
And good services. If you want to visit, do call and make reservation
4
Good service and food. They did forget one dish but it came promptly after. Reasonable prices and only expensive if you order the crabs.
5
Did a booking 1 hour before the meal and it was no problem at all. Every was good. Highly recommended.
4
The restaurant famous for Chili crabs and it really taste good . The fried sotong and crispy duck are also fantastic. Very good place for dinner in a group or family . The service is also good . Recommended for all especially tourists
5
Jumbo is a must visit for any Singapore visit. The pepper crab and jumbo prawns are phenomenal. I highly recommend Jumbo Seafood
4
The crabs, scallops and prawns are fantastic! Totally enjoyed it. Though the common dishes like vegetables seems a little over priced. Overall a great dinner experience
4
I had been to all the Jumbos in Singapore over the past years, except this one at Dempsey Hill.We are glad we went, as it was far less crowded than the Riverside or ECP outlets. The service at Dempsey was also less hurried, and they were not so anxious to get you out as soon as you looked like finished.We ordered from the ala carte menu, and all of the dishes we ordered were excellent. In addition to Chilli Crab, we ordered a selection of the small sized plates. The small sized plates are good as you are able to try a selection of seafood, rather than ordering the medium or large plate sizesThe dishes arrived in a rather haphazard order, but it was still all ok.With drinks and more than ample food, it was about $75 pp inclusive and we were happy to pay that.Call beforehand to check for table availability, or make a reservation. Otherwise you may waste a taxi fare
5
The food was great, service was great! Told them that my family would be celebrating my grandmother's 80th birthday, and they prepared a whole plate of birthday buns for her! Even decorated it with a candle! 4 of the waitresses even came to sing Happy Birthday for my grandmother! Very grateful for everything. Will definitely come back again!
3
The food is overpriced but the service made up for it. Like the way they handle the Alaska crab and geoduck. However it is only worth a try, not a second. Nothing fantastic really just some interest seafood you donâ€™t usually get. Bill in excess of 1.6k for a family of 8. 5 dishes in total. The wonderful service is worth mentioning though
4
We reserved the table few days ago but still couldn’t get indoor table, sold out of the most wanted Sri Lanka stone crab, disappointed!
5
30th year and counting. With this kind of consistency I’m sure they will be around for another 30 years.
4
Jumbo at Dempsey is my favourite. Quiet & peaceful. Staff are attentive and they do their best to offer a good experience. I will go back again soon.
5
the food is great ! we had a great moment there! we will come again when we go to singapore next time!
5
I'd hoped for a fun and delicious holiday at Singapore. Jumbo at Dempsey Hill took care of the delicious part of my wish. Pepper Carb and Tangy prawn were outstanding. We took our time with lunch and the staff was attentive and didn't rush us.
5
Celebrated Dad's birthday and was served by an excellent team. The lady supervisor who served us that day was good forgot to get her name though she is in blue and had her hair tied up. Good service!
5
it was great service despite a relatively busy lunch crowd and would recommended this place to anyone who is looking for good decent seafood.
3
I think we should have done more research before coming hereStaff were fantastic food was ok but so overpriced $70 for 1 large chilli crab Not value for money but the experience was still funStaff helped us used the crab cracker and showed us how to eat the crabWe had individual bibs and it was very messyBeer here is very expensive $ 25 for 2 large glasses over the top Won't be going back cheaper to find chilli crab at a hawkers market in Singapore
4
Overlooking the harbor, this fish restaurants brings you one of the better crab dishes I had in Singapore. Definitely try the chili crab and black pepper crab for amazing tastings.Quite crowded, you'll have to wait for the crab to be prepared but definitely worth it. Order some smaller appetizers in the mean time! Great place for a walk along the water as well
4
Good service. As I didn't expect the seat is in open air and weather was hot on that day, requested for air con in door seat but unable to get it. But the girl is trying to accomodate our preferred seat with patience. Food is great.
5
We enjoy our visit :)
The food was great as usual, the service was very on point! Will come back again for sure
5
without crab smell, very tasty sauce.
they reponded very quickly about our booking.
not so hot outside seats.
4
Food is nice and delicious but promo rate as member has came down. Hope they can reinstated to 20 percent for lunch again.
4
Lovely chilli crab, must have with the sweet dough balls, great selection of dishes, if you like seafood you can't beat this place
4
We shared a set menu for dinner at Jumbo Dempsey. Chilli crab was great, food was very tasty and service was friendly.
3
A bit of waiting despite booking we arrived around 830 visibly peak time we were proposed twice shared table even we refused first time ( as European we are not familiar with that) Nevertheless food was good and crab tasty
5
Food is good and not too crowded when we had our lunch. very relaxing environment. Will visit again. Parking is also not an issue.
4
A regular of JUMBO. Chilli crab was great as usual. It's JUMBO and you're paying for it. Service crew is slow and unattentive. Could improve on friendly acknowledge of our requests. Could better explain the member program.
5
I dine at Jumbo whenever I have overseas guests as chilli and pepper crabs are synonymous to Singapore. The food was excellent and the staff did not neglect us despite being very busy that night. The service was what I expect from a 5-star restaurant. Well done
5
Jumbo Seafood is a chain of seafood restaurants in Singapore and we had a business lunch at the one in Dempsey Hill. It's rustic and modern all at the same time and we let our hosts order for us. The Pepper Crab was amazing as were the prawns covered in some sort of egg crust. I could have eaten 2 servings of the prawns as I have never had them prepared in such a delicious way. Not cheap but well worth a visit if you love seafood
5
Our Favourite place of dining when we are craving crabs. Reserving with CHOPE was easy and efficient.
4
we booked 530pm but restaurant only open 545pm. however, food is nice with good service.
the restaurant should allow the reserved patrons to sit first while waiting to open the restaurant
4
The food were alright, nothing to shout about - chilli crab was too sweet, pepper crab was too salty and the prawns weren't fresh at all. However, the service was flawless thus the very good rating.
4
It's nice to come back again to Jumbo and we got the usual dishes, steam fish, cereal prawns, kailan, tofu which were all good. The crabs were small though compared to the other times I was here. Service was prompt.
5
Great dining experience..managed to get into the restaurant fast with Chope reservation..no issue with the reservation
4
I chose the set B meal for 2, came with kang kong, fried cod fish, small squids & chilli crab. As usual, it's Jumbo standards. Together with drinks, it came to $160+ for 2, not cheap for a simple lunch.
3
Nice seafood restaurant but the food itself is normal, and overpriced. The chilli crab sauce is not very good.
4
It was nice to visit with tourists. Food was really good and good value. But service was average. ..
5
Firstly the area gives you a colonial feel like like the great Somerset Maugham stories.A very well laid out spacious restaurant with attentive service.The Jumbo Crab is the renouned dish but others including some of their Korean dishes ate very good.You will love the family or celebration atmospher
4
The must try are the usual suspects: chili crab and pepper crab. We had both and were not disappointed but honestly, nothing to shout about. The crabs we had were huge. A pair of claws were almost a meal for some of the ladies! The steamed fish was fresh and yummy. The prawns were not only OK. Actually, the best part of the whole dinner was the service. The waitresses were so detailed in their attention to our needs that we were delighted. One good thing about this place is that there is ample parking and is free too
4
great seafood and services. having dinner outdoor is quite hot though. service staff are very helpful.
5
Staff was prompt in getting us a table.
Staff service was actually better than expected and was prompt with our requirements.
We ordered their signature chilli crabs and it tasted great!
4
Love the pepper crab, seaweed tofu, baby squid, the honeydew dessert.
how ever the price of crab has gone up so much!
5
We don't eat spicy food so we didnt get the chili crab. Amazing salt & pepper crab and cereal prawns... Best meal of our trip! =)
3
The food was very nice. We ordered chili crab and the crab was quite fresh. Everything was good, just the service need to be improve.
5
We celebrated Mum's 67th birthday @Jumbo Dempsey. The waitress serving us was very patient & made good recommendations. Speedy service & mouth-watering dishes!
3
Should probably stuck to my gut and order the black pepper crab but went with what made this restaurant famous with the chill crab. The sauce was a bit too tangy for my preference as I want more kick and less sweet.
4
Great food in a relaxed setting. Perfect with colleagues. Pepper crab is a must. Terrace is really nice, especially if you go late enough, temperature is quite OK, and then can cover it in case of rain.
5
This was the second time we try Jumbo food. The chilly crab, matched with the fried buns, is strongly recommended! Steamed bamboo clam is also very delicious, but quite expensive. Anyway, the food provided by the restaurant deserves its price. I will definitely visit it sometime in the near future
1
First time back at Jumbo after a few years. Food quality has dropped drastically; the squid paste you tiao was tasteless; sambal Kang Kong way too oily; black pepper crab too buttery and not peppery enough; deep fried baby squid not crispy nor sufficiently sweet; homemade tofu sauce too starchy. Terribly disappointing. Obviously caters to tourists who don't know any better.
5
We usually order chili crab and black pepper crab. This time we ordered Alaska king crab 2.6 kg weight.
Very soft and easy to cut using scissors.
Like a crab eating in Hokkaido Japan, very tasty and big enough for us.
5
We are very nice experience at Jumbo (taste, atmosphere, service is all good). But chili crap is so difficult to eat well. and fried rice is too much value and high price.
1
After being seated the waitress was so rude while taking our order, we had no option but to get up and leave.
5
As usual, the service is tip top and the food quality are superb.
Is always a pleasure to dine at this outlet.
3
The chili crab is so so.. salted egg crab is lousy. The fried tilapia was bland. I wd not visit again..
5
What a great seafood place
We enjoyed a fresh 2.9 kg alaska crab ( half pepper, half chili) and some fresh steamed fish.
All perfect. If you a seafood lover you camt do anything wrong.
2
Was looking forward to this visit to Jumbo, having tried long ago the other one on Riverside and bringing a friend from overseas. The food was generally basic. The crab was not that fresh, and the mee goreng and rice were clearly basic. The service was friendly but not efficient, taking ages to serve drinks. The overall location is worth a visit for Dempsey Hill nonetheless but you could choose another restaurant.
4
Just went with my husband for dinner and all we ordered was crabs plus one vegetable dish. One Sri Lankan chillie crab and one pepper crab were so much to eat (1 kg each) for two persons! It was just super yummy. Comes with the price though - 2 crabs, one small vegetable, 6 little buns and 3 beers cost us $239!!! Dining in Singapore is getting more expensive by the day, it is scary!
3
Must admit that the owners / operators of Jumbo - or perhaps the Dempsey Hill outlet must know that business is so good that customer service is secondary. We specified indoor dining for our 6:30 pm reservation and was told that we need to get out and leave by 7:45 pm so that they could prepare for a 8:00 pm seating. By 7:30 pm we were served or dessert and had the bill presented even though we didn't ask for it. Saving grace was food was good and the young lady from China who attended to our table was hardworking. Great place for dinner if you don't take exception to be subject to customer processing instead of customer service
4
Went for dinner with a few friends on a Sat night, lucky reservations were made as they were quite packed. So we got our table immediately. As usual the food was great and service was attentive. Ordered the chilli crabs and my fav Deep fried Yam paste with scallops. Prices are a tad pricey compared to similar dining establishments. But a great place to celebrate occasions or a great night out with friends in air conditioned comfort.
3
Waited very long for the chilli crab, we are 2nd to arrive & placed our order at the restaurant, saw other tables were served faster than us. Chased several times for the crab. They shd be proactive to update us the status.
3
Reasonable food, staff spoke rarely english. Difficult to understand
Price quality rate not really good
5
Always enjoyed jumbo be it for personal or business setting. The crabs here are the best both black pepper and Singapore Chilli Crabs
5
If you are in Singapore,don't miss the Jumbo seafood restaurant,there are five in number, the foods are excellent,staffs are very friendly, don't miss the black pepper crab ,there you can have the Alaska crab but you have to ordered well in advance. have also the lobsters and enjoyed your meal which you will never forget.The taste of every dishes are superb,they don't compromise the quality of the food
2
Given the reviews on TA and the hotel recommendation, the experience was rather underwhelming. The "award winning" Chilli Crab was too sweet. Our order included cod which was too sweet as well. The food missed the mark was consensus of our party of four from NY that loves pan Asian cuisine. The only thing that was close to good were shrimp with red red fried whole chilliest but it had more chilli peppers than shrimps, making the 3/4 of the dish inedible. They need to better balance of ingredients to this dish. Nonetheless the evening out was not memorable and cat recommend it to anyone.
3
We were recommended Dempsey Hill by our hotel as we hadn't made a reservation at any of the Jumbo's. Luckily upon arrival (5:50pm) we were able to have a table provided we were finished by 7:30.The prices compared to other places we had checked were high - $78sgd per kilo. The meal however met our expectations and the crab was of high quality.The biggest let down was the quality of service considering over $200sgd was spent between 2 people. There was a real communication barrier for anyone who spoke English. So when the bread dumplings hadn't arrived after 15 minutes of the crab being on the table I had to go and contact the host as she was the only one I could speak to.It becomes quickly clear the restaurant is targeted to Chinese tourists. Whilst the quality was good if you're Mandarin isn't up to scratch I'd look elsewhere
3
service was very slow and intermittent so lots of waiting in between each dish. waitress was courteous but inexperienced. The crabs were fresh but taste of cooking is average. The Garoupa was overcooked. 3 crabs cost almost $200 and the Fish was over $100. The manager was not aware of the SIA promotion and even though they were polite, it took awhile to convince them. For me, I will not be going to jumbo again
4
We had a meal at Jumbo in Dempsey and the food was good as always.Recommend the Chili Crabs with deep fried buns, Scallops in Yam Rings, speciality tofu and nice big pieces of chicken satay.Service has improved during this visit with helpful staff but sometimes waiters from China have trouble communicating in English.Otherwise, you can depend on getting a good feed of seafood at Jumbo
5
This restaurant has different outlets. We went up to Dempsy hill as this was close to our hotel Shangri-La. There were only a few tourists there which is always a good sign. We orded their chilly crab and loved it. Really delicious and sipcy. Finger licking good
3
We went there as a party of 9 in mid-July.The food was pretty good – my parents thought very highly of the fried buns and the crabs in particular, and they are very fussy.Unfortunately I cannot say that the customer service was of the same standard. One of the managers was extremely rude and had a very poor attitude. She was very unpleasant to speak to – she was on the verge of having a go at us when we were placing the order for no obvious reason. I had asked if we could see the fish before they take it to the kitchen just so that we could determine the size. She was extremely unprofessional about this and took it rather personally that I was suggesting their food was not fresh. Her memory was not any better – I had asked for some plain rice for my daughter which she forgot to place; she then also forgot our second order of the fried buns. I witnessed that she was rude to her own staff, who on the other hand was very polite and attentive – she poured us tea whenever she noticed we ran out.A what could have been very nice dinner ruined by rude staff
4
Food is fantastic. Price is slightly above average but if you are member, then the price is slightly more reasonable. Will continue to patron this restaurant. Cheers
5
Superb staff service and one of the best ! Quality delicious food with affordable price. Nice ambience for dining :)
From a Very satisfied customer
4
Food is good, like the service
I have enjoyed all the food but if the price can be reduced it would be.perfect
1
Great place for Chilli Crab 🦀 but unfortunately they still serve shark fin in a variety of dishes. Jumbo, please remove shark fin from your menu.
5
The chilli crab is always good and tasty. I would recommend the golden buns as they go well with the crab.
4
Food was ok. Did not order their famous crabs.
Customer service is good except when comes to biling it will take ages....
4
Ordered four dishes without the famous crab. Still the dishes were tasty and skillfully cooked even though they are simply dishes.

I find it hard to write a bad review for this restaurant as I believe the food must be good, unfortunately I didn't get the chance to try it (the starters I did try were pretty unremarkable). So to cut a long story short during our visit to Jumbo we had 3 waiters: 2 simply didn't speak English and the only one who did was just not paying attention as she was taking out order (was looking elsewhere and speaking to colleagues at the same time). We ordered starters, drinks, a main for our toddler and 2 mains for us. After 10mins we received a small dish with peanuts and no drinks. 10min later one of the starters, rice and drinks. And almost 1h after we had arrived, with our toddler hungry and impatient we asked for the 3rd time for our order just to be told that by mistake our food had been given to another table and they had to ask for it again. We decided to cancel our order and leave without having dinner at 9.30pm. The waitress at this point apologized and gave us a 10% discount which is basically the service fee (yay!). If it had been a one off thing I would have understood but the service looked simply not competent from beginning to end and needs to be urgently improved

This is the place for someone who enjoys Chilli Crab. Though the name is chilli crab it won't be as hot and spicy like an Indian especially ANDHRA hot. Though I didn't eat chilli crab all my friends including my professor from US enjoyed it. This place is quite away from the bustling CBD area and someone who enjoys a quite environment but a bustling crowd inside the restaurant should not miss this place.

Had the lunch set and the portions were just nice. The cereal prawn, marmite pork, pepper crab claw, lobster bee hoon were very tasty. The wait staff were attentive to our needs and appeared very sincere in making our dining experience an enjoyable and comfortable on
4
Great service! the wait staff took the initiative to change my bib when I dirtied it.
got a great view of dempsey. awesome!
3
Had the pepper crab and mantou (bun) - both were very good. The beancurd (Taufique) was also very soft and tasty. However found the venison slightly salty and kangkung was over-cooked
5
Food was great, value for money. The serving was really fast and efficient. Very impressive. Atmosphere was awesome too
5
Thanks to the wonderful attention and service given to us by your staff, our birthday celebration that night was memorable! Food A* with your Service!
3
cereal prawn, hor fun, vegetarian toufu was good as usual. but somehow the black pepper was lacking in taste, meat was tough maybe it was a 1.1kg crab. and it was so hot sitting outside in the afternoon.
5
We were made to sit outside because its fully booked inside at Dempsey...Service exceeded our expectations.. Food have always been good👍👍👍
4
Food is tasty. Quality is consistent. Really wish the portion could be bigger for the price charged.
Crispy baby squid $14
Steam Cod per piece $22
Salted egg yolk prawns $24
Mocha pork ribs $22
Mee goreng $18
Seafood fried rice $18
5
Countless visits and alway never fail to meet expectations. Service was extremely good this time!! Will alway go back for the chili crabs!!!!
5
We had a business dinner and we opted for the jumbo seafood at Dempsey and were not disappointed. It was a lovely evening so we sat outside and enjoyed both the black pepper and chili crab amongst other items. What a great experience and a wonderful time enjoying one of my favorite dishes there is in the world, chili crab
4
Known to many Singaporean and visitors offering Singapore Chilli crab, boiled prawns, fried mini sotongs, fried kankung sambal, mie goreng, sharks fin and many more....is a great place to entertain as well as for the family. Make sure you make reservations as it is crowded out at the verandah or inside with air conditioning! Price is mid range to the upper end
5
Ordered drunken prawns but the highlight was definitely the chilli crabs cooked with Sri Lankan crabs. Sauce was good and crab was extremely fresh and meaty.
4
The food at Jumbo has always been excellent. And this visit was no exception. Wonderful crab, delicious prawns with pumpkin dish.
4
food quality is good, Dempsey area is amazing and Jumbo easily stands out in seafood dishes. Reservation is usually hard. I got my booking for 9pm but was unable to grab a table a little earlier.
4
Went here for dinning with after review meeting. All peoples only focus on food and relationship building, all this happens because of quality of food and attentive servicing level from staffs with such a niche environment (after rain).
4
Make sure you book early for indoor seating as outdoor can be rather hot & the lighting is also pretty dim. Food & service is good as usual. Will visit again for sure.
5
The waitress who waited by table was excellent. She gave good recommendations. If you do not order "seasonal price" items, you will not burn a hole in your pocket. Will definitely go again.
3
No we did not try the signature chilli crab.We wanted geoduck but they ran out ??The scallops was only so so and so are the other dishes. The service was pretty alright as they do attend to you.Overall an average experience for an above average pricing
5
This is the place to go if you want to try the famous Singapore's Chili Crab. My personal favourite is the Black Pepper Crab since it's actually spicier but the Chili Crab does worth the praises. Their fried rice is also very tasty and perfectly done. Oh, and the salted egg prawns are delicious! Whether you come with a big group or not, you're in for a treat! Do reserve in advance though
4
We took our overseas friends to Jumbo Dempsey and had a great meal there. The black pepper crabs were outstandingly fresh and well seasoned. Very pleased with that but the Black Pepper Pork Ribs were a little disappointing as they were not as tasty as expected. The Steamed garlic prawns were a little too garlicky but otherwise a good dish. The Mee Goreng was a little overcooked but very tasty with good size prawns and other ingredients. Baby squids were delicious but though we ordered a large dish, the portion was on the small side. The black pepper rib-eye was well prepared with plenty of onions. Overall, a good experience with good service but wish I could have redeemed my Jumbo $ as well as received the member's 10% discount. To only be eligible for one seems a little stingy on the restaurant's part
4
We asked our friends who live in Singapore where to get chilli crab.They suggested Long beach and Jumbo. Checking out Tripadvisor we went for Jumbo. I booked on the (Satur) day- which meant the Jumbo at Dempsey was the only one at reasonable distance that was available. If you'd like one of their other restaurants, it's prob best to book well in advance.I can't compare with any other chilli or pepper crabs, but my husband and I well enjoyed both. We had one of each and shared + some steamed and fried buns.Deliciously well cooked, not too far, moist and sweet. Gorgeous.Personally, we liked pepper crab best- the chilli crab has very little chilli in it and the sauce is more Italian and sweet rather than Asian and spicy. The pepper crab actually has some oomph to it. Anyway- if you'd like to compare them yourself, this is a perfectly nice place to do that!There is a Ben &Jerry's next door- if you'd like ice cream for dessert ;
5
Fantastic Chilli Crab the Singapore way! A must try for all foreigners. Must try with the buns. Also Savour in different style ie black pepper and salted egg yoke or butter.
5
Probably the best Jumbo in town, in a nice cosy Dempsey area. Ample of parking space and outdoor dining in the evening is pleasant feeling! A must for tourist, if Jumbo is in your list!
3
Food was good except for 1.
Requested to serve rice n noodles together but did not.
Atmosphere was alright.
5
Had the Chili Crab with a few sides and it was amazing and authentic. A must visit even if you are on a stop over with 7 hours in between flights. Get out of the airport and take the Green Line...😊
5
Good seafood not to be missed. Test it yourself to believed this. This is not over statement. However, if the price can be lower, it will be outstanding. Cheers
5
The chili crab was very delicious.
We are planning to visit again.
Black Pepper Will Be Black
It sounds like a very nice restaurant.
5
We regularly visit either Jumbo's or East Coast and on Friday, sitting outside the crabs, pepper and chilli were spectacular with good service. Cereal prawns are also very good.
4
I am patron of Jumbo seafood for years. For mother's day, i would like to celebrate and eat at the place that will never fail me. I booked online, and i can reserve the place for 4 people. The table was in the open air, so rather hot regardless of the fans around. However there was 1 service crew named Cat Ho, which was kind enough to offer cold water for my son and daughter. This kind of service really made our day. Good food, and good service .. Keep up the good job
5
Because I wanted Sweet Chili crab the last night of our business trip we had a feast at Jumbo - cant tell you the prices but I know we spent a ton (most likely on the wine). Overall the food was excellent the crab was delicious we ordered the Pepper and Sweet Chili and both were excellent along with the many other delicacies
5
We are all big chili crab fans and have eaten it in different restaurants, and indeed in other countries too. We were all agreed that this was the best we had tried, and the pepper crab and other food and service is pretty hot too. The men were happy to get the sauce all over their hands, but I always bring thin throwaway rubber gloves and this solves the sticky hand problem. The atmosphere was great and the restaurant was packed but they managed to fit us in although we didn't have a reservation
4
Reserved seats were good. The explaination about menu was good too. The price a little bit expensive but is vauluable to take that price.
5
From the making of reservation, to making a call to push back my appointment by 15mins, to the entire dining experience, ... it was simply enjoyable!
As always.
5
Everytime we visit SG, we go to Jumbo Dempsey! Very good atmosphere and foods are very nice. Chill Crab and Pepper Crab are best taste in SG, we believe! Brown breads and Mee Go Reng are also very good!
4
We visit this restaurant when we was in Singapore for business and it was really nice experience. The staff was very kind and helpfully.
4
Visited on a Sunday afternoon with reservation conveniently made through Chope app. Food was served hot and relatively fast. Attentive service provided. Pleasant visit.
4
Good choice for seafood lover especially on chilli crab. The service is fine but should have more waitress to look after.
Overall good place to enjoy seafood.
5
Well taken care by Cyrus Lim and his team.Always given the freshest crabs of the day. Great recommendation on selection of wine. Surprisingly the lamb steak was great!
5
Our son took us as he enjoyed a visit previously and we loved the evening. We did not have the signature crabs but shared various dishes, all good. We absolutely loved the giant prawns in sweet and sour and the venison was superb. Staff excellent and the place buzzed. Very happy
4
Think Singapore and think chilli crab. Jumbo has one of the best on the island. We sat outdoors at this branch, under cool fans. The sweet/spicey sauce was the right cosistency and there was plenty of it. Breaking into the shell to dig out the smooth sweet meat can be challenging for first-timers, but well worth the effort. Just be prepared to be messy - large plastic bibs were provided. Only negativ comment is that the crab could have filled the shells better. Order at least 3 or 4 fried buns each to soak up the sauce. We also had crispy baby squid which would have been great bar snacks. The salted egg yolk prawns could do with more salted egg. The steamed live fish (a fresh-water fish called soon hock) tasted excellent, though a little overdone
4
Was briefly in Singapore for a short stopover and had heard of the award-winning chilli crab.Given its reputation, it was not expected to be cheap, however the chilli crab was delicious. Also enjoyed the entrees ordered and both the lychee and mango flavoured sodas looked and tasted great too
5
We ordered the signature Chilli crab and black pepper crab. The crab was fresh and meaty. Taste was nice. Overall atmosphere at the restaurant is good.
5
Never fail or disappoint expectations. Must go especially if you are a foreigner and order the chili 🦀. Rmb to dirty ur hands!!
2
Poor variety for set lunch. Air conditioning is not working well. Service is not prompt. Can be much better.
3
Delicious food...black pepper crab...but services need some improvement..visited during lunch...crab aprons need to be requested and plates filled up need to ask for new plates... nevertheless food is delicious.
4
I was looking for some chilli crab, but quickly discovered that a lot of the items at Jumbo have peanuts or peanut oil. That being said, my friends and I had a great a time eating cereal shrimp and pepper crab. All of it was very tasty and the restaurant staff were awesome with my allergies. Would go back for sure
3
This is my 5th time to Jumbo in Dempsey and I must say that the standard has slipped somewhat. The service is excellent - fast, friendly and responsive. There were also very good dishes like the spinach with century egg, chilli crab and the steamed fish. However the HK noodles fell totally flat and was pretty much tasteless. We also ordered a golden Phoenix chicken that nobody wanted a second bite of. All in all for the price that Jumbo is charging I would expect a better overall standard.
1
service was not professional. when I ordered two chilly crabs, the waitress simply took the order as one chilly and one black pepper and processed it as default. when we found the mistake, she responsed that all visitors take one this and one that as default. with the default order, why you need us to make an order
2
Went there on a weekend for a family dinner. The food was ordinary and the experience was made worse by a non-working air-conditioner. It got progressively warmer and more uncomfortable as the dinner service progressed. Everyone at the table ended up fanning themselves. At the prices they charged, they should at least provide a comfortable dining experience.
4
food at the Jumbo chain has been consistent and good, but the service can be a hit-and-run. service tonight was pretty average, with the servers rushing, overpouring your beer to try to empty your jug for you, overzealously clearing plates of food that your crab shells fall into your drinks, but being apologetic later and wanting to replace them
5
Came here on a Sunday evening. Reservations are a must. The lady at the front of counter was great. Most of the service was good as well. The food is always good, somehow they always manage to get it to a pretty uniform standard at the various outlets. Although I suppose some Singaporeans will always have that one restaurant that does their favorite chili crab that no one else does better. For me Jumbo is good enough
5
It have been a pleasant and sumptuous feast at Jumbo and our friends aboard from Japan enjoyed the signature Chilies Crab very much
3
The Salty Grab really yummy, but inside air-con it's fully not enough...
I think better train the staff no need always come to serve table. Quite disturb.
4
Nice restaurant, ample parking. Crowded. Nice spread and variety of seafood. Good Chilli crab and black pepper crab. Also had drunken prawns which was tasty
5
We had our company post sales kick off dinner here.
Every dish was superb; Chilli & Black Pepper Crab, the soup, the various fish and shell fish it was all good.
The staff were very friendly and welcoming.
Recommended!
2
Service was poor - The waitress did not even acknowledge my request when I asked for garlic, she simply ignored me. And they just kept bringing the dishes out even though the table was full and cannot accomodate another plate. We had to ask the waitress to get the kitchen to stop for a while. And our plates were full of shells and the waitresses did not bother to change the plates until we had to ask. Unacceptable service for a restaurant like Jumbo
4
We used Jumbo Monthly Deals voucher for 30% discount on lobster. Before discount, the price of local lobster was $168/kg and Australian lobster was $268/kg. The waitress who took our order said that the voucher was not valid for local lobsters. I pointed out that that was not a condition in the voucher but she was adamant. So it was not a good deal because we went there for lunch, we could have got 20% discount on all items without the Monthly Deals voucher because I am a member. Jumbo is not fair to its customers. The lobster was delicious but too expensive even after the discount
5
I was there with a big group so we all got to order a bunch of dishes and shared. We had the crispy fried baby squid, their famous chili crab, pepper crab, live prawns with cereal, and another prawn dish whose name I don't recall (had a creamy batter/coating). They were ALL fantastic and full of flavour. I highly recommend Jumbo Seafood.
3
The surrounding ambience was nice and relaxing. Reservations are required, as we were there on a Tuesday evening around 8pm and the restaurant was packed. We ordered the chili crab, fried octopus, kangkung belacan, satay, mee goreng, fried cod fish and prawn. The only thing which awed me, was the size of the crab. Besides that, i thought the rest of the dish was pretty average in taste and the noodle was slightly too spicy for me. Service is good
2
We frequently visit Jumbo restaurant and as always the chilli crab required a special mention. Excellent as always along with the venison which is tender and flavourful. Service has always been on the slow side but today, it has plunged from acceptable to just appalling. We were served by a young male waiter who initially was quick on his feet. Offered us napkins, brought the plates and food out fast. However when we requested for plates, he nodded and promptly forgot about it. We asked for a top of up tea and again, it was forgotten. And the icing on the cake......At the end of the meal, he came back and asked if we wanted tea (completely forgotten that we've requested for it previously) and we said yes please. He took the teapot, took a couple of steps, and another table asked him for something. He nodded, and dropped our teapot back on our table and went to serve them! On the other hand, he was too quick in wanting to clear our table even though there was still food in it. His priorities are just so wrong...Please note the restaurant was one third full as it was a Tuesday lunch so there was no excuse for his behaviour. I can only imagine if the restaurant was packed....I love Jumbo's food though prices have sky rocketed for the last 3 years. I might go back but definitely not to this branch until they sort out their hospitality.
5
This is the place for Chilli Crab and Black Pepper Crab, while soaking up the atmosphere of the old Barracks and plantation around you. If you have not had the Crab before, order one of both (Chili and Black Pepper). Great combination, order with rice, so you can eat all the sauce that comes with the Chilli Crab. Reserve your table, obviously outside if possible weatherwise!Located near the Singapore Botanical Gardens. Plenty of parking space. And plenty of other restaurants/bars inside the compound in case Jumbo's is full or not to your liking, or if you just want to have a drink before your dinner
4
Best e chilli craf dishes in Singapore. We will come back for a beautiful nature location. Reccomend you book before come. Highly recommend black peper craft.
4
The seafood is fresh and the taste is good! Tho the location is a bit far, compared to other branches such as Clark quay!
4
One of the most popular places for seafood Singaporean style! Can get crowded in the weekends. Best to reserve. Food is authentic. Try the chilli crab.
4
The crab which was supposed to arrive 45 mins later arrived even before the fried rice. The dishes were all served quick except the rice which we wanted to eat together with the rice of course.
4
Come here for some amazingly well cooked crabs. Crabs are never easy to cook -- at most places, I have found them to be over-cooked or, worse, under-cooked! Not here.Chilly crabs were cooked to perfection. Spiced appropriately, the meat inside the shells was just right. For an amateur, it can get messy -- but is is well worth it.Ordered some greens. It was steamed properly and laced with garlic flavour -- a perfect foil to the crabs.And some tiger prawns to compliment all this -- a perfect meal 
5
It's a place i regularly go to if i have business friends in town. I prefer dempsey branch as we can adjourn for drinks afterward.. My last visit was on a weekday. and it's full as usual. You have to book well in advance to secure seats in the air conditioned areas. Was packed to the brim when we arrived at 7.30. Service is fast and food is served very swiftly and in the order we requested. Do expect some gltchhes as service staff are taxed to the brim.--be patient and they will respond well. We ordered abalone, steamed Song Hock (fish) hong kong style, prawns and veg
4
Went here for dinner as part of a group of 6, we had various dishes which kept coming through out the meal Food spicy but delicious with good service. This was a Monday night and busy and I'm told it's like that every night so recommend you book
5
3 of us hogged on 2 small black pepper crabs - the black pepper flavor had sunk deep into the crab meat, which is not the case in many of the other Singapore seafood restaurants we have eaten in. Kung bao shrimp and stir fried asparagus were also delicious as was the crunchy baby squid which went really well as an appetizer with the jug of beer. We left full and very very satisfied- can't remember eating better crab in Singapore
5
We attended as two couples with prior booking at 8:30hrs on a Tuesday night, the place was pretty much rammed.The waiter was an excellent guide, and he was called Kelvin, we were served as an outside table adjacent to the indoor restaurant.We had sugar cane Prawns , Spicy Cod, steamed Broccoli, Rice, Noodles Steamed Turbot, & Chilli Crab + a lot of wine and The ambiance is great, the service is great!Best meal we had in the 5 days we were there
3
I was taken here for a business lunch, so it was a group of 6 and there were many dishes served, but all the locals raved about the chili crab and, of course, we had it. It was certainly enjoyable, but I agree with several other reviewers that it's no longer very "chili" and the sauce is now much toned down to something closer to ketchup. The other fish dishes were fresh and well prepared. But I'm not sure I'd rush back for the iconic crab...
1
Food was delicious, but staff members gave me poor service. The company ought to do something about the poor service.
4
If you plan to relish Atlantic Cod or Blue Crab, then you must try it with Jumbo. Try chilly crab or Barbecue sauce Cod.
4
Love crabs this is the place. Spicy crab in red curry is what we had and it's really delicious. All other food we have ordered was very good and delicious. This place is crowded so make sure to reserve a table.
3
Food was okay... pretty standard as compared to other Jumbo outlets.
Ambiance was better here though, with a more exclusive feel...
4
Great spicy food
Bustling noisy environment
Lovely people serving, efficient with personality and fun!
Elephant price !
Nice treat!
4
The food did not disappoint. We ordered chilli and black pepper crab; maintained standard. Go for indoor seat if available. We were assigned outdoor seat and bitten by mosquito.
4
I'm a Long Beach fan and remain one - but I was very happy with the food and service at Jumbo. We called ahead and got a 9.30pm reservation, arrived at 7pm, was told 90 minute wait but were called 10-15 minutes later to return. Chilli crab comparable to Long Beach, Pepper crab, not as good as Long Beach. More impressive interior than Long Beach
4
We were at the Singapore Botanic Gardens and decided to go to Jumbo, which is nearby, to have chili crab, one of Singapore's signature dishes. What a messy and delicious meal! When we arrived, we were told that they were totally booked with reservations, but fortunately one of the waiters found us a table. We were supplied with bibs and plastic gloves, thank goodness. The crab was very good but the sauce was outstanding! Bread is not included, so we ordered what turned out to be two small sweet buns that helped to soak up some of the sauce. We also had peanuts that were served with a sweet chili sauce...interesting appetizer. The crab wasn't very expensive, but the beer was! If I remember correctly, it was about $S10 each. But it was a really good meal
3
The renowned Chilli Crab has changed over the past 40 years in Singapore and Jumbo is no exception here; the crab dish is now sweet chilli with little "heat" and finishing the sauces becomes overly sweet for the palate. We enjoyed experience of seeing the small truck pull up with the days catch and see the chefs selected or rejecting the crabs that they were buying; it lent to the culture behind the meal.
4
Our family had a Chinese New Year Reunion dinner at this restaurant. It was crowded as usual. We waited for a long time before food started to arrive and for a long time before we finished our dinner. The staff could not cope with the demands of service though they tried their best. Generally, the food was good. They maintain their standards but one dish deserved mentioning. The colour of the drunken prawns was deep red making us suspicious that something may have been added to the prawns
4
Food was good. The service could be improved. The restaurant was full and service staff were really stretched. The saving grace was the brilliant and confident recital of traditional Chinese New Year Lo Hei wishes at the beginning of the yu-sheng toss.
5
Great food, great service! Nothing to complain. Service staff is very enthusiastic preparing for our Yu Sheng. Prompt service and great environment! Must try the salted egg prawn, mee goreng, chili crab, sambal kang kong.
5
We love their pepper crab there, the lobster with ginger and spring onions, the razor clams with garlic. You have to book as it is always very busy.
3
In festive period, there are a lot of people. So staffs were very busy, if I add some dishes, I need to wait for a long time around 30-40min. Taste is not that special.
4
Staff was attentive and makes an effort to check on us. The interior area can be much bigger to accommodate more guests.
1
As a long time customer to Jumbo over many years, I took my family for Sunday lunch at their Dempsey outlet on Jan. 22nd. Worst service ever encountered at a Jumbo outlet alongside an overpriced menu. Would not be returning again.
4
Business trips mean outings with colleagues to local restaurants which have a name and some history and having gone to one of these a couple of times in Singapore I never wrote a review.What can I say...they can make a hell of chili crab and for the folks who do not like seafood they also have steak and some pretty good one. You will all be set with some bibs, gloves and hankies because you will need it in case you will go for the crab. Try dipping the bread into the crab chili as it is amazing.Even for the vegetarians among us there is more than enough to eat as they cook some good soups, fry some vegg tempura or just serve plain cooked vegetables. Deff an event and make sure to come in group and sit outside which makes the experience way better
4
Been here a few times but service this time was nicer than previous visit. I had to preorder some food as my dinner guest had to rush to airport and they were served promptly when we sat down. We got lots of attention from service staff and felt very well taken care of. Guest loved the chili crab and it's definitely the star dish.
4
Jumbo is indeed honest in its dealing with customers and take pride to serve quality food. The first crab that we reserved was not of the best quality after cooking, hence, we were informed that another crab would be replaced and will have delay in serving the dish. This is indeed impressive as Jumbo could just serve the crab and only replace if the customers complained. However, do check your bills for items ordered as there were double input for teas and peanuts in our bill. Other than this minor point, I would strongly recommend Jumbo for its seafood.
3
Dining experience requires equal parts quality of food and service. Sadly, service is something totally lacking at this place or it is also possible we just happened to end up at the table of a hapless, clueless server who had just been hired that day and had never done this type of work before. In addition, although we did have a reservation, the hostess refused to seat us indoors with the rationale that "it is fully booked inside" so right off the bat that set me in a bad mood as even with fans at full blast, I was still bothered by the tropical humidity.Yes, the chilli crab and fried snapper were a delight but again, I did not have a single bad meal in Singapore
5
I like the ambience at Dempsy it brought back many good memories from years past! Looking forward to have my regular gathering there.
3
Great choice of typical (amazing) Singapore style seafood and meat dishes are not to be left untouched! Food is excellent but staff is not the friendliest and complicated.
Would still recommend.
5
Black pepper crab and prawns were fresh and tasted great. However other non seafood dishes were not very good. So my advise is to order seafood only at this outlet.
5
We had group dinner in this restaurant.The ambience was very nice, we feel like in outdoor but it is air conditioned. The food was so good and the Alaskan Chili Crab was very tasty.
5
excellent prawns with chilly, menu is giant antic you can choose a lot , with Chinese beer it a nice combination
4
Chilli crab was simply excellent! We were dining al fresco thanks to the cool December weather. Service was a little stretched due to the holiday season but still pretty attentive nonetheless. Pricing a little on the high side but still I think value for money.
5
Food is awesome specially crab, prawn and even the vegetables with eggs . we had Salted Egg Yolk sauce, 3-egg spinach, black pepper crab & fried mantou, egg fried rice, chilled honeydew sago and Oh-ni/ yam paste with jasmine tea and all were yup. you can choose this place if you sea food lover without a second though
3
We arrived for dinner on a week day and although we arrive by 7.30 the restaurant was already packed. We had a reservation so we didn't have any issue.We had to wait a while until our table was set. Please note that as soon as you sit there some peanuts that are put on the table. You are charged for the peanuts if you eat them. We had to call out several times for some one to come and take our food order. No one came, finally i had to get up from the table and go catch hold of a person to come and take the food order at our table. As we were a table of 9 people we We ordered one portion each of the Crab chilli and the Singapore pepper crab, Both disappointed and weren't up to the quality and standards that we were expecting. Although the Pepper crab did taste a little better than the chili crab. We did order noodles and some other food items but we had mainly come to try the famous crab dishes. Service is definitely disappointing and very cold at times. Staff seem to be busy doing their own thing. We had to nearly get up to get hold of a staff each time we required something. I was left disappointed and with a huge bill of over 350$ for average food and odd service, Not a place i would recommend. Very disappointing and very expensic
5
Had an enjoyable lunch at this outlet! Nice ambience and the staff were very polite. I prefer the Dempsey outlet to the ones at Clarke Quay. Adequate dining and walking space. No rush to complete our meal compared to the other outlets. Perhaps the lunch crowd was much less compared to the dinner crow
5
Reservations suggested as this is a busy restaurant. Tasty spicy crab and lots of great fresh seafood options as well as noodles, and other meat options. Large tanks on the back wall so you can see the live crabs, lobsters, fish. Great service and delicious food! A table of 4 and everyone thoroughly enjoyed
5
Treated an american friend to his first chilli crab dining experience.
And...
He is a convert ...
Loving the singapore experience only at Jumbo.
4
A better experience among Jumbo Singapore franchise. Attendant experience, food quality and servicing the meal.
5
Excellent service. And food is tasty. Called and order food before rushing down. Although being the last customer we are still welcome by the staff.
4
Very good place for dinner. Seafood quality was excellent, service was ok but wish a bet slow some times when its super packed. Shrimp cereal is a must and pepper crab.
4
Generally pretty good seafood esp the black pepper crabs. It's pricey but its the sort of prices you expect at Dempsey Hill. Service has generally been fine but at times when it's packed over weekends, it may take a while to get their attention.
5
A great restaurant in a nice location in downtown Singapore. Service was good and the food was outstanding. The pepper crab at Jumbo tastes best and is consistent at their other outlets as well. The prawn dipped in egg yolk is also a must-try
5
Best chili crab.
Fine service.
:)
close to the botanic garden.
little bit hard to find out in dempsey hill.
slightly dark inside.
5
Service' was prompt and warm. Food is delicious as usual. Slightly inaccessible unless you are driving but in return there is free parking.
4
We ordered the set meal. Even the smaller menu was a lot of food. The crab was the main attraction although the rest of the courses were very nice. The service was good but the worse part was sitting outdoors which makes want to eat and run instead of taking your time to enjoy your lunch

I am Jumbo member and have my meals, both for business and family, in Jumbo for many years. But my recent visit to Dempsey outlet is my worst experience with Jumbo. I went to Jumbo to celebrate my wedding anniversary. A PRC waitress in black shirt easily destroy my important day without any apology.When ordering, I asked if there is steamed scallop, the answer I got was a short and rudely "Mei you!". Then I ask if there is steamed bamboo clam, the waitress immediately stopped me with a very rudely "mei you!" I was very shocked that I did not do anything wrong, how could she treat me like that!My wife and I were a bit unhappy and cut down my ordering list until $200. I did not think it was necessary to spend further money in this kind of unfriendly restaurant.This PRC waitress seems thinking I was the customer does not have ability to spend money, and significantly looked down on me.When my dish came out of kitchen and were placed on side table. She ignored my dishes in front of her and serve dishes to the table beside me instead.I wait for several minutes and nobody serve my dishes. Finally I had to stand up and serve the dish myself, in this so-called fine dining restaurant! This did really make me upset! The day was my wedding anniversary day! She destroy my great day!Jumbo @ Dempsey is not worth more than even a nut on my S-Class!I will never be back

Wonderful food, as ever. Personally, my favourite is black pepper crab, but everything on the menu is great. Although the restaurant was very busy, service was first rate. Absolutely nothing to complain about.
5
Good food, and nice atmosphere. For me, here is the best Jumbo restaurant in Singapore. I would like to come back here again.
4
The waitresses are very fast and attentive. Disappointed about the amount of chili crab served in the set menu.
5
excellent as always, we have always enjoyed out meals there. we will come back again for sure. the waiter who took our order was lovely.
4
Nice environment and food. Serving quite fast with 80% occupy.
But the price is slighty higher to normal.
2
We booked a table for 4 persons and got the one outside closed to the AC, we. Am not even understand how they can propose such table with the price of the food. The food is good but not that outstanding compare to the bill. The service quality is the same as McDonald. Except the place that is nice, will probably never go back there !

We were a party of persons that enjoyed a Saturday evening dinner here at Jumbos. Based on reviews and input from friends our expectations were "all over".The service was great. Was greated with a friendly smile and shown our table which we at the time were free to chose maybe due to later seating (9 PM).The waiter happily informed us of the various dishes and choices ams guides us to what we beleived was a good choice. He carefully suggested alternatives when we were entering into very unfamiliar dishes and asked if we had any experience in those dishes or would we maybe prefer an "easier start". That was appreciated when you have limited knowledge of the specific asian/Chinese variants.We had delicious shrimps and a superb crab split into one half chili crab and one black pepper. Regardless the dish was excellent.Last positive thing was that we overdid our orders but as the staff asked in what order we wanted to be served the food they kindly cancelled our last order which saved us from rolling down Dempsey Hill on our way back.During the dinner plates were exchanged continously to keep it clean and nice all the time. Very friendly service throughout the evening.Not the cheapest place but sometimes its worth it. Note that peanuts and chinese the' which is on the table and offered early is charged which might be a bit strange as it can appear to be offered as a service.

Been here for my wife's birthday as she's a great fan of chili crab. The crab was great, some other dishes that we ordered were also good.The restaurant is huge with variety of seating (indoor, outdoor).At first we're assigned a table at the garden area, but it was too close to the aircon unit. So we moved to the terrace area, but then it was near their cutlery service station so it's so noisy for my 6month-old son to sleep. We ended up sit at an indoor table. That way, staff were attentive and helpful to us.The restaurant is located in Dempsey Hill, so needless to say, it is a fabulous area
4
The ultimate 'singaporean' experience for those who've never been: signature singapore chilli crab, cereal prawns, salt and pepper crab, etc. The food is good but not stand-out great. For example, the crab came out warm not hot and without 'breath of the wok'. Favourite dish of the night were the cereal prawns... sweet and salty at the same time!There is outdoor (no air con) and indoor (air con) seating and the place is pretty big. However, it is strongly recommended that you try and make a booking as this place gets packed!Expect to pay more than a usual mid-range restaurant

Hosting 2 business associates from Thailand on a sat night... They have requested to try Singapore famous chilli crab... And at the same time, they would also like to experience Singapore nightlife on a sat night... Recommended Clarke Quay but they have already been there before.. Hence i brought them to Jumbo@Dempsey.. Has not been to Dempsey for close to 1 year... surprised to find there's many new interesting outlets (or maybe i have missed them during my last visit??). Upon arriving jumbo, sure glad i made a booking when i arrive and saw the long queue!!! (so make sure you make a booking for sat night! jumbo is so advanced now and the booking even come with sms confirmation)The whole place is full and we can only sit outside (yes, there's outdoor dinning option).. its perfect as the guests are smokers... Ordered a few dishes... Wanted to order both chilli / back pepper crab but the captain was care enough to stop us stating that we have ordered too much for 3 pax.... so she suggested we order black pepper crab but she will still give us with the chilli crab source (FOC) for our fry bun... While the whole place is very busy, the staffs are still very attentive... but a bit slow... But food arrived rather promptly for such a busy night.... The guests finished all the crabs and commented it taste better than Clarke Quay... And they totally loved the environment as we went for drinking session in another Dempsey outlet..
5
Beef was good compared to the seafood (the irony). Location is great. Just 5 mins drive from Orchard and free parking!
5
First class food and very attentive (and very young waiter) who was excellent with his recommendations. Not cheap but good seafood never is.........
5
Set in the charming Dempsey Hill recounts this Chinese restaurant offers amazing Black Pepper and Chilli crab.
5
Went to Jumbos at Dempsey Hill on a Tuesday night and it was very busy so booking is essential We had the set menu for 4 people ( $52 a head ) The food was fantastic in particular the fried rice! Service quick and efficient and food plentiful although we did order another fried rice it was so yummy Having been to the other Jumbo restaurants in Singapore this is my pick
4
We had dinner with friends on Saturday Nov 19 at their branch in DEMPSEY. If you like to dine alfresco away from the blasting aircon, the seating outside is very well ventilated with lots of ceiling fans. We had very good Chilli crab and pepper crab one each. Both cost $70 before GST. Please book especially on the weekends as it is always full! Great place to bring tourists as they can stroll around DEMPSEY or have a coffee or dessert after dinner at the many cafes there. Worth a visit definitely
5
Admittedly, I haven't been to very many chili crab restaurants, but I've eaten at Long Beach (two locations) and Jumbo @ Riverside. Jumbo @ Dempsey is the best of the lot. You'll need a car or cab to get there, but the locations is very much part of the charm. Although the indoor dining room is rather small, it wasn't crowded, and I really wouldn't have minded eating out on the terrace. Service was very, very quick. We started with sambal kangkong which was unusually good with tiny shrimp mixed in. The de-shelled cereal prawns were also done just right. We had black pepper crab that was delicious, but the main event was, of course, the chili crab. It wasn't drowning in chili sauce, but there was more than enough for dipping both crab and buns
4
5 of us having the following : plate of fried squid, and prawn roll fritters, century egg yolk prawns, satay expat style (as they were too big and the peanut sauce too watery), Hor fun with scallop and prawns,And finally 2 Chilli crab and beers for allOf us and some juices. Highlights were the Hor fun, Chilli crab and fritters. The rest were ok. For $400 it's too expensive. But good O' Johnny paid. Would I come again, well not really as there are lots of competition in the same street. But they were packed on a weekday night.
2
Firstly they refuse a voucher citing deepavali which falls on a Saturday like any other weekend. So eventhough we had booked a month in advance in order to use the voucher, we were denied. Then this super inattentive staff was super distracted when we tried to make our order so we had to repeat several times. Very disappointe
3
Went to Seafood Jumbo in Dempsey. Ordered the Pepper Crab and a few accompaniments. The rest of the order came out way before the crab. The Crab took a while as expected but they should have held the rest so the meal was complete. There is two area a inside and outside. Overall busy place. Easier to get into than the riverside one. Overall the pricing was very high but quality was good
4
My colleagues and I had dinner in this restaurant with the referral of the hotel concierge. We tried several dishes where all were excellent however the one that stands out the most is prawns with pumpkin. One drink you should never miss here is the coconut. Our waiter Richard was exceptionally excellent. Thank you.
5
very present, nice service, location is good near my home, the cod fish is very small portion, need improvement
5
I noticed the crab I ordered only had one pincer, told them and they gave a new crab dish. Didn't do something weird like add another pincer or try to give a gift voucher for next visit.
4
Jumbo Dempsey offers a great place to chill out. The food and service was excellent, especially the steam fish is fresh and tasty.
4
Dempsey is an oasis in Singapore. And Jumbo Seafood is one of many good restaurants there.
They serve a good selection of seafood including the famous chili crab.
Absolute worth a visit. But bring enough money.
5
I enjoyed the atmosphere with friends to hang out. Nice ambience and glasses of beers to chill after work.
Food is delicious. My favourite is Chilli and Pepper Crabs.
5
We didn't wait too long for our table and the food were served to us very fast. The waitress and waiter were prompt to change the used plates too.
4
Enjoy the terrace and fresh sea food . Best go there after 8:30 pm. This is the place for Crab and prawns. Try their house specialities.
4
Love the Chilli Crab and Seafood Horfun.. Enjoyed the food and service at Dempsey branch. Excellent place to entertain guests and no worries about the parking.
3
We came for the chili crab. Some weeks ago we had enjoyed black pepper crab at the nearby Long Beach and now we wanted to try what I thought would be its hot and spicy cousin, based on photographs I had seen of the dish. I was totally disappointed to find out that it was nauseatingly sweet, and only a little spicy. Maybe that is how all chili crab is in Singapore, but I wish I had been warned. On top of that, the crab did not arrive at our table until well after we had finished all the other rather tasty dishes we had ordered, including the fried rice. My tiny wife was therefore already so full she did not even try the crab, and our friend ordered another bowl of white rice for himself to go with the sauce. I may want to try the restaurant again, because the other dishes were good, but not the chili crab
4
The beginning of the meal started badly with poor reception / waiting time when we had made reservations! Arrived at the table, wine was misunderstood 3 times! THEN THE manager took over with a great management and the food came. Black pepper and Chilli Crab to die for. The prawns and broccoli was great. The Manager recovered the situation massively and made the meal & experience much better. Service can be hit and miss (if the manager is not there) but the food covers for a lot of it.
5
Food was nice and less crowded on Saturday.
Better service than other branches~!
Very nice for family gathering.
5
The service staff was attentive and the Chilli crabs were delicious , my guests were happy with the food
4
Great tourist location. Dining experience was really good. We did a group booking. Pepper and chilly crab was great. Washed down with loads of beer. Must visit to try the crab.
4
Good service from the servers. Flexible in our request in changing to a private room as we reserve for a 10pax lunch. As we have a budget in hand, the server is very helping in recommending the dishes within our budget. Thumb up~
5
Jumbo's Chili Crab is a Singapore classic for a reason- the sauce is to die for. This was my first time at the Dempsey Hill location, I have previously dined at the Clarke Quay Riverside Point and East Coast locations. I cannot tell any real difference in the quality of food between the outlets. The Dempsey location was much more laid back than Riverside Point and the staff was accommodating in expanding our party size by 1 person. In addition to the chili crab, my favorite menu dishes are the baby kalian with garlic, de-shelled cereal prawns, egg fried rice, scallops, and the fried rolls (all of which go well with the chili sauce). Unlike the Riverside Point location, the Dempsey staff is also very good about providing drinking water for the table. Definitely the best servers I have had at a Jumbos restaurant.
1
Staff are busy talking among themselves, they are not attentive to customers. We ordered set meal , they served 5 dishes together, we could not manage to eat fast enough and food became cold. After we had finished everything, we waited for 20 minutes , nobody serve our dessert.
4
We had lunch at Jumbo Dempsey on a week day. It's been a favourite restaurant of my family for many years. Glad to say they have managed to maintain the quality of their food. We had prawns with salted egg yolk, scallops in yam rings, crispy baby squid, black pepper venison, spinach with salted and century eggs, fried tofu, Malay style fried seafood noodles, and yam paste with pumpkin. All delicious
5
The black pepper crab is simply delicious! Spicy but not too spicy that it masked the natural flavour of the crabs. We all loved it - but a bit expensive at $78 per kg. One crab of about 800 gram is not enough for 3 persons.
5
To satisfy our craving for crab, I booked Jumbo@Dempsey for dinner over the weekend since I have their birthday voucher as well. The lady who served us (forgot to get her name) was really great. As there is a minimum spend of $200 before the $100 birthdsy voucher can be utilised, so after we placed orders, she eben bothered to key in our order to check if we needed to top up. She came back to inform we were still short so we ordered some more dishes. The chilli crab was so good. Fleshy and fresh. We had the crispy baby squid, live drunken prawns, venison and fried rice as well. Was really a satifsying meal and I see that the servers tied the apron for each customers whereas the other seafood restaurants that we went to never had such service. Even upon clearing the plates yesterday, they checked if the dinner was ok.Was an enjoyable dinner
5
this is a must visit place to have crabs. we came here as a group of 6 to try chilli crabs. the place did'nt disappoint. its located at calm and scenic dempsey away from hustle bustle of singapore city. food is economical and amazingly tasty. only visit if you are fan of sea food as the name says
5
Had a wonderful time, great service, friendly staff. Location is a little hard to find if you are not taking a taxi.
4
Always reliable for its Seafood and Crab Curry. Has a good set dinner for 4 on weekends. A Very busy restaurant , which is worth booking in advance.
1
The service was also not good, one waiter need to cover too many desks. Run out of coconut water at 9 pm ?
5
We had the pepper crab, stirres fried broccoli with scallops, spinach soup, steamed soon hock, mocha pork ribs which are all delicious as usual. Jumbo dempsey has not disappointed in the many years that we had patronised them.
4
Jumbo has never failed to meet my family cravings for chilli crab. Attentive service and well cooked Chinese dishes. Definitely a good choice for gathering.
5
We had steamed crab and black pepper crab. Both crabs were excellent, solid and meaty. Crispy baby squids, boiled prawns and scallop yam rings were excellent too. However the seafood fried rice was only satisfactory.It would have been quite pricey but a $100 birthday voucher made the meal affordable
4
Recently we had dinner here with a friend visiting from India & his son who studies in Singapore. Our group included 3 kids aged 5 to 16, and 3 grown-ups, of whom 2 had food allergies. There was something for everyone. It was Sunday evening and packed, so you must make a reservation. We came by cab, but you can take a bus to Gleneagles Hospital and take the leisurely 15 minute walk. We normally sit outdoors, but this time were inside. Both are quite nice and the whole place has a busy but happy buzz about it. I started devouring the peanuts with chilli sauce as soon as we reached.For the 6 of us, we ordered one each of the noodles with prawn & chicken (no veggies!) for my young kids, a medium of the famous chilli crab, a medium egg fried rice, salted egg prawns., and 2 venisons. We thought we had ordered too much, but ended up getting one more venison, so 7 dishes in all. The dishes have different sizes and you can also customise your order, like the noodles for my kids. To drink we had some wonderful fresh coconut & Tiger beer. Unfortunately I am now allergic to prawns and crabs, so couldn't have the chilli crab that I used to love. When you have this - go for it, wear the bib they offer you, don't wear white clothes and get your hands dirty. Thats the best way to enjoy it.The only thing I would have liked them to improve on is the English skills of their staff. Many could not understand basic instructions
4
A place where expats go. Food was top notch.Chilli crab and black pepper crab were exceptional but not a delicate meal - up to my wrists in delicious sauces.Too many dishes to describe but all looked good.Outdoor dining option was perfect for the weather.Bookings recommended though we were lucky to score a table. Plenty of other dining venues around if you luck out
5
I tried making same day reservations to the restaurant over at Clarke Quay to no avail so I tried the Dempsey location and I lucked out. This was my first visit to any Jumbo Seafood restaurant so my wife recommended the chili crab for me and she ordered the crispy shrimp with salted egg for herself. And as we always do, we shared our food. What an amazing experience!! The chili sauce was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy but didn't overwhelm the juicy taste of the crab meat, while the saltiness of the salted egg complimented the fresh sweetness of the shrimp. I don't think I've ever had a better seafood meal. By the way, the service was also excellent despite the busy atmosphere of the restaurant. I can't wait to try their dishes on my next visit.
4
Saturday afternoon I decided to take my friend's family of 3 to dinner. They are Americans living in China so it's a bit challenging to find a place. My wife suggested this place so we called to squeeze into a slot early in the evening. We ordered chili crab, breaded prawns, Sambal kangkong, coffee ribs and a couple others and taro paste. They enjoyed the food and service. They also tried the lime juice and loved it.
3
I saw good reviews from many blog site in Korea. However, I might expext too much from your restaurant. Service was bad. No care after food serve.
5
Nor.1 chillicrb & black peppercrab restaurant in Singapore.
Every time we are vary satisfied, and fried rice with seafood is very nice.
This fried rice is much better than Chinese restaurant menu.
5
Wonderful experience and great food here! Went there to entertain some friends who were back from Australia.
4
We ordered Chili and also Pepper crabs - Pepper crabs out performed and were awesome.
Service was a bit slow and waiters wandered around slowly without supplying all the crockery etc.
Ambiance was good and sitting outdoors was relaxing.
5
Very good place to have seafood for family. Especially source for pepper crab was great. All family members, not only kids but also seniors were happy
4
A great buzzing restaurant with indoor and outdoor dining. Bug fish tank inside where you can choose your dinner. Open view kitchen to see chefs and kitchen staff at work while you dine. Great selection of food, friendly staff and very efficient. A little pricey but excellent place to visit
3
I went here with my family around a week ago, it was located at a really lush area with a lot of really good restaurants with many different cuisines, we were led to our table in the corner of the room, our waiter couldn't speak English, so it was really hard to communicate, and she was talking on her earpiece while taking our order which I found pretty rude cuz we were trying to talk to her. After that happened, all our dishes came before our fried rice, I mean rice is a main dish, so we had to wait for our rice for around 30mins and by the time it arrived our food got cold.. Other than that, we were seated on a wooden platform and when ever the waiter passed out table the wood would wiggle and make loud noises which really disturbed my appetite to eat. That would be my only complain, other than that, the food was amazing and apon leaving the restaurant the waiters apologized and gave us a big smile which I found sweet.
4
We dined here last two years prior and had an equally enjoyable family evening.The one drawback was that the six of us were at a table meant for twelve and outside in the heat rather than inside as on the last visit.The food is still top class. We had the obligatory chilli crab and black pepper crab, scallop dumplings, kai lan and rice. We kitted up with aprons and gloves and set too. I was very intrigued by the "egg rice" which in 35 years of travelling in Asia I had not knowingly encountered; it seems that egg whites are added to the rice when frying; absolutely delicious. Seafood is moderately expensive everywhere in Singapore so Jumbos seems as good a place as any to indulge oneself. Bookings imperative
2
hello.i was visit there on 5th of Aug.i order chili crab and fried rice.dishes are really nice but staffs are not nice ...it makes me feel bad.also, they just give the peanut and tea without any comments (it has charge).please kindly comments the information before serve them
4
Make sure to make a reservation, the place always seems to be full. It is slightly price , but the service and quality of Food it worthwhile. The service staff is attentive, dish served promptly and they take turns (also immediately) refill your tea/drinks.Recommend to try their Chili crab, steamed clam
4
Had chilli crab, one of the best crabs i be had. The Sri lankan crab was Meaty and the sauce is my favourite part to the dish
5
Love the food there, although they are short handed , the waitress is very service oriented. Food is good n we really enjoyed oyr dinner there.
4
The staffs are friendly and the food are great ! We order one 1.5 Kg Black Pepper Crab and we enjoy it very much. Also the Sambal Kang Kong.
4
Chilli crab was good and soup portion was generous. We love the squids on the boat.
Service can be improved
4
Incredible seafood in a pleasant ambience albeit at a significant price. Service was substandard. We were generally ignored. For instance we poured our own drinks all evening.
4
Round tables should be used for all customers as the food has to be accessible to all. Long tables not so suitable
5
The waiters and waitresses are attentive and are able to advise adequately on the food selections to make for our family size
5
Easy to use and fuss free booking system. Lovely lunch as well at one of the best reknown local brands.
5
Although we were half an hour late and there was a queue on Fri night, Jumbo did not release our reservation to others. We tried to call the restaurant to inform them that we were running late but they did not manage to pick up the phone. So we guess they take Chope reservations seriously :-
2
Booked the private room for 11 and ordered the set menu H costing $88++/pax.Service is bad and slow. We have to personally get out of the room to collect new plates, tea for handwash after eating the crabs and the whole lunch took 2 hours although we have given prior instructions to finish before 3pm.Staffs are not well trained and when they put the bowls and spoons, they were literally throwing them on the table.Dishes were not impressive, the lobsters were over cooked and crabs served have soft meat, not really fresh. We have pre ordered the longitivity buns and after informing them, it took another 30 minutes for them to serve. The buns have little lotus paste , were hard and not warm. Only two dishes stand out: the steamed fish and first dish of fried tofu. I prefer the outlet in East Coast whereby the team is more experienced and service is better
5
We are a group of 4 visit on 13 July, the crab is good, the lamb rack is good, the vegetables is also good. In fact everything is good and we all had a wonderful night.
4
Nice food and ambient . Service is not bad. Price is pricey and if it is reduced by another 30 percent. It will be perfect
4
This was a festive and high energy restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. There were many large parties enjoying the food. We had chili crab along with shrimp, venison, squid, and rice. All of the food was good along with the service.
5
I visit this place every time I'm in Singapore and always order the chili crab as well as the pepper crab - simply divine!!
4
Service good but miss on our order for bamboo clam.
Service staff attentive and courteous
Chili crab taste not what I recall it use to be
5
Went here with my family and we enjoyed ourselves with the different variety of food. The staff get distracted often with your order however as it gets rather packed. The chilli crabs is a must try!
4
Was there for a celebratory dinner with my best friends. Staff was attentive and helpful despite the restaurant being fully booked and crowded. From past experience, best to book 3 to 4 weeks beforehand to get a good table
2
Not worth the price. Neither was the atmosphere anything exceptional. There are better alternative if your are thinking of bringing your client for seafood.
3
The reservation was 8.30 pm. I requested 8 pm but no availability. At 7.45, jumbo called to say I could come now earlier as they have a table now. Reached there 20 min later n no table and waited past 8.50 to get a table. Standing there for half an hour testing my patience on their service. This is bad as my guests are from overseas and must b hungry. The food was decent tasting except the presentation was boring plating. A live fish steam was totally covered in black sauce. The vegetable looked miserably stir fried uninteresting. 2 midsize Chilli crab, one small steam lobster. If they plate all food nicely then it won't look so miserable n u appetising. 7 of us. Bill came up almost $100 per Pax.
4
Jumbo is famous for its crab and they live up to their reputation. Popular with both locals & tourists. Food & service are both excellent. Thought price for crab is a little pricy compared to other seafood restaurant. A stone throw from Orchard Road make it very accessible by cab.
4
Food was very good. Everyone at the table enjoyed the meal. Especially recommend the chilli crabs, mee goreng and spinach tofu.
1
Within 5 minutes of entering the restaurant we were moved to 3 different tables. You would think that a party of 2 should be easy enough to accommodate, given that we made a reservation, and the restaurant was half empty. Once we were seated for the third time, a waitress placed a small bowl of peanuts on our table, which we thought was a side dish that came with the meal. However, we found out that we were charged for the peanuts. While it was only $1.20 (to which I told the waiter I didn't mind paying because we did eat the peanuts), I said to him that it was unprofessional to put a small dish on the table that we did not order, and not tell us that they were going to charge us for it. I don't think that the staff understood my point about informing future customers that they will be charged for the peanuts (or the tea that they offered us, but we declined it), and took the peanuts off of our bill without mentioning if they were going to do that aga in the future or not. The service was lackluster, and I expected more since there is an automatic 10% service charge. When we ordered, the waiter looked uninterested, and spoke a mile a minute. The silverware to crack the crab was not on the table, and I had to ask for them to be brought out after our meal arrived. I also had to ask several times for the steam rice that we ordered, as they did not come out with our main dish. Our water was only refilled after I got out of my seat to let the waitress know that our cups were empty. I asked her to leave the pitcher of water on our table so that I wouldn't have to get up again to ask for a refill, but for some reason, it seemed like that was a totally foreign concept to her as she looked confused when I asked that. Also, almost all of the staff spoke to us in Chinese, even though we do not understand it, and kindly asked them to speak to us in English (I understand that we are Asian, and appear to be Chinese, but that is no reason to keep speaking to us in a language that we clearly do not understand). We ordered the chili crab, and while the presentation was well done, the taste was average, and the crab was small. Maybe all the hype of Jumbo Seafood's chili crab made us have very high expectations, or maybe the poor service made us not enjoy the meal as much as we could've. The crab legs were tiny, and barely had any meat. I feel that there was more chili sauce than crab meat in our meal. I've had better crab for the same price, or even cheaper
2
The female staff taking the order was impatient and had an attitude that was hard to bear. Otherwise the servers were courteous and efficient and food was served very promptly. But being treated like a fool at the start, and in the company of guests, left a bad taste
4
As first timers to Singapore I was told I must try chilli crab whilst here. Recommended to come here & glad we did. You must book as very hard to get a table, we were lucky to get one last minute on a Monday night. The place was full inside & out. We ordered the chilli crab which was delicious & make sure you order the bread rolls to go with it as you can then soak up all that delicious chilli crab sauce at the end. We also enjoyed the chicken satays & the fried rice with egg. Special mention to our waiter Richard. If you get him serving you, your in for a great night & he's very knowledgeable & will make sure you order the right food. Hopefully my first taste of chilli crab won't be my last
4
This is a very busy restaurant so bookings are a must. I cannot imagine how many crabs they go through at one meal sitting as almost every table orders one. In fact we ordered 2 so that we could try the peppered crab which indeed turned out to be our favourite. I also enjoyed the prawns and the steamed green vegetables. My one criticism is the finger bowls and the hand towels are way too small to compete with the messy fingers you're bound to get. Even pulling the paper bib into service was insufficient for hands to really be clean. However I guess that that's part of the overall experience. Staff were reasonably attentive but with so many patrons you have to expect some delay in the quality of service. Extra wait staff would probably remedy most of that concern
5
We chose this restaurant was because this is closer to our flat and we thought during the weekend the ones in the Clark Quay will be full. But the dinning experience was much better than we thought. The restaurant was located in the woods, even sitting outdoors, it was not hot at all, through it was sunny and quite hot! The dishes were very delicious, a chilly crab, a chicken and a vegetable. Compared to the ones in Clark Quay, the service here was much better, especially the reception. All the staff were very nice and helpful. We told them we will ahead to airport at the very beginning, and they remembered this and called a taxi when we finished the payment
5
Ingredients were super fresh. The meal was really yummy and the main star of the restaurant obviously was CRABS! They meaty and succulent and cooked nicely but would have been better if the shells were a little more pre-cracked as many customers were seen to be busy knocking and cracking the crab shells. Really appreciate the considerateness from the serving staff ... from offering plastic covers for our mobile phones so that it doesn't get any accidental food or drink on it , to tying paper bibs for us to changing our dirtied plates ever so frequently... very attentive and helpful
3
My family and I (7 of us) went for dinner on Sunday night. As I made the reservation on the day itself, my dinner time was 8.30pm. We were seated after a few minutes after we reached the restaurant at about 8.20pm. I fully understand that because we were having dinner late, many of the dishes we wanted were sold out. No more drunken prawns, no more spinach with conpoy and egg, no more mee goreng. No more sambal kang kong too. Make your reservations early. What I was not pleased was the waitress who took our order was very distracted when taking our order. Perhaps she was a senior waitress, attired in different uniform. Often listening to her ear piece and giving instructions on what to do elsewhere. We had to repeat our question or order. Not very much attempt was seen to help us with our choice of dishes or size of dishes. First time I had encountered such service in Jumbo seafood Dempsey! Fortunately the food we ordered was good. The chilli crab and fried buns were a saving grace. Guess the food is still worth trying. But service definitely need brushing up

Jumbo Seafood @ Dempsey is a regular place that I visit whenever we have family celebrations or bringing friends from overseas to taste the famous chili crab. After a few visit and experiencing the same problem, I hope that Jumbo can improve the air circulation and air-conditioning in the area which is air-conditioned. After we sat for a while and started eating, we started to feel hot and stuffy. There is no additional stand-alone aircon or fan to help with the air circulation, hence, it gets really uncomfortable sitting in the area. The other issue is the timing of serving the food. We ordered a few dishes and crab. However, we waited a long time for the crab after all the dishes. Hence, maybe Jumbo can relook at the way food is being served to customers to ensure no long breaks.Other than these minor improvements that Jumbo should look into, I must say that Jumbo's chilli crab is still my favourite. I will be back, but hope that it would be a more comfortable seating arrangement

Despite making reservation, i didn't get a table till 30 minutes later while walk ins were shown the table immediately. Never mind, maybe its one off. Food was served, nothing fantastic. Its typical local seafood. But then, they forgot one of my orders. Duly cancelled it. Paid and left. Forgettable experience at enormously inflated price. What's to like about it?

Great food and good Chilli carbs. Restaurant was accommodating for 3 families with 4 high chairs. Would love to try again.
3
The carpet inside stick like a wet dog. Service is without a smile. Overall jaded looks. Food is good
4
Thank you for the wonderful experience. My husband is well happy that we celebrated the Father's Day in Jumbo Seafood at Dempsey.
5
Though there are quite lots of cuisines in SG, in my opinion, Jumbo Grab is few of them which could be really signature for SG.
4
Food is absolutely good. Is worth the price and wait time. Be realistic to wait patiently for the food. Must go as a group to enjoy varieties of food being shared. Not worth all the travel if gone alone or less people.
5
If you don't have reservation then you must wait or take other vacant seat that reserved by others for a later time. 2 hours would be the right time for you to enjoy the complete meals (including Crab)
4
We enjoyed the dishes especially the sambal kangkong and vegetable dishes. Chill crab and bun still taste equally good.
5
Arrived 30 minutes before my appointment but got a table with wife, requested a seat outside and got it food was served within 15 minutes, excellent service and as usual food was excellent especially the pepper crab, I must dine at Jumbo Dempsey or east coast every time I'm in Singapore
2
Was recommended to try this place and went with a group of friends. The soft shell crab was very good but the other food was disappointing and the service was ver slow as we were continually asking where our food was and if we could have more to drin
2
Well... for some seafood and wine by the glas at a place that feels more like a eating hall or canteen SGD 500 (for two) is just way too much, even for Singapore. Maybe worth half of that. On the following day we had dinner somewhere else for a similar price, but with more decent food and a cozy atmosphere. So, there are much better choices around
1
Chili and Pepper crab and rice were nice, but customer service and atmosphere were..... really not good.
4
The food was great. We had prawns, mee goreng, seafood rice and black pepper crab. The table was outside and very pleasant. The service was OK, maybe that was due to our location.
1
Jumbo is listed company, so must squeeze more profits, which is increase price or reduce cost. But its getting to point where I may no longer patronize them. The crabs at $75 were tiny. The red garoupa was tough.
4
Have been going to jumbo for years now. It is always where I bring my guests to try the chili crab. It's reliable - good
Food and prompt service. Just noticed that serving sizes have grown smaller.
4
It is a very cosy and relax place to have dinner though the price is a bit high. But worth the money spend.
5
Delicious black pepper and chili crab. I ordered for take away to Manila. They packed the crabs perfectly. Thank you for the extra take away bibs.
3
We had 11 people, so we got a private room. The food was very good but expensive. It seems like it caters to tourists. It was fun to eat family style as it allowed us to try a lot of different items. Good food but expensive and they charge you for everything including the peanuts and wet wipes for after you have eaten the crab. Go to Chinatown for great food at a much lower cost.
3
It was a last minute reservation that I requested from the concierge and was pleasantly surprised that we got a table for 12 for dinner at 7:30. We were seated outside and the weather cooperated.  The good - the food is consistently great. We had 5 kids that had low tolerance for spicy food, so we asked the server for another crab suggestion. She said the steamed one with salted egg. Didn't really enjoy it as much as the chii crab, but my siblings devoured it.The bad - (1) Getting out of Dempsey can be a real challenge. You have to ask the staff to call a cab for your. Since we were a group of 12, that meant 3 cabs. We ended up calling our reliable van driver who was there in 10 minutes after I sent an SMS for help. (2) Our food took forever to arrive.Will I eat in Jumbo again? Definitely. But maybe, I will consider another location
4
Very busy the evening we went, but the atmosphere was pleasant and service staff were very friendly and helpful. The crowds didn't seem to affect either the food quality or the service, apart from a long wait for the bill at the end of the meal. The chilli crab was really the highlight of the meal -- very fresh and absolutely delicious. I'd suggest ordering a side of mantou (steamed buns) with the chilli crab to soak up the sauce -- it was so good I wanted to pack it home with me! Other dishes included crispy fried baby squid (perfectly done) and the venison (tasty, but disappointingly little venison smothered in a lot of onions). Service issues at the end aside, Jumbo@Dempsey is a great choice if you're looking for tasty local seafood in a comfortable environment
5
Black pepper crab is a clear winner over the Chili Crab. Makes you lick your fingers. Clarke Quay restaurant has a beautiful view of Singapore River for a wonderful evening dinner if you lucky to get a good table. Dempsey outlet is bit conjusted but the service is good and prompt
5
Service is good and prompt. I would recommend others to eat at Jumbo. Food is tasty and served warm.
4
Food was good but we were asked to leave within an hour of our food being served. Atmosphere was nice.
5
It was a good place and the atmosphere was great as well. food was really good. but the service was just as usual
4
Seafood at Jumbo is consistently fresh and delicious. Service was good even though they were rather busy with a full house.
1
Although I was there at off peak -9 plus for dinner, the wait for crabs was an hour! Embarrassing considering I brought overseas friends
4
We have been regular and loyal guests at several Jumbo Restaurants throughout the Island and always left feeling satisfied. Each time we return to Singapore a must-go-to for dinner is always a Jumbo. In our view it is the best seafood place in Singapore.
3
It was actually good at first not until all the food were already served at the table except for one that would greatly satisfy the chili crab, Fried rice. We waited a long time for the rice after numerous follow-ups. By the time it came, we were no longer much excited for the food since it has already cooled down.
4
Dempsey is an Ex-Military Camp which accommodates a number of eateries. Jumbo which is famous for its crab has a branch at the Dempsey and am glad that I chose the one at Dempsey. The child and pepper crab is great, very fresh and not expensive by Singaporean standards. Ask for out-door seating at the balcony if possible. The balcony overlooks the rest of Dempsey with lots of vegetation. Feels like dining in an urban oasis !!
4
Tried out the famous seafood restaurant and was quite impressed . The food was great but the service can improve . Staff seem to be complaisant and not very keen on driving more and repeat business . It was quite rushed . Nonetheless the food was fantastic. The sambal Kang Kung , the chillie crab and the deep fried buns were divine !! Recommended but remember to book a table in advance cause they are always full . A must do in Singapore
3
The chilli crab & pepper crab we ate here was excellent and delivered promptly, the night we visited was busy, a small line up of people were waiting to be seated, we were seated after a short wait. However the table service was very ordinary which was unfortunate, maybe it was an off night
4
Food was excellent. However food was served too fast giving impression restaurant wants us to finish and leave quickly.
I ordered birthday longevity buns way ahead but was told that they had run out. But l was pleased with free dessert in lieu.
2
We celebrated my mother's birthday at this restaurant and was generally disappointed by the food quality and taste. Most of the dishes were rather bland and the meat (roast duck & venison) was on the tough side.
1
Was there to celebrate my mum's birthday. Food was good however the service was poor and the portion they gave was really pathetic. With that price, I think other restaurants can offer more.
4
Nice food and good service. Recommend to get there earlier. I arrived at 8:30 and only have small crab left
3
We were there on weekday night but the restaurant was very crowded. We made reservation. Service is quick fast despite the busy night. Food are OK. Good place to have big party
5
Went with a group and enjoyed it quite a bit. The black pepper crab really is amazing. Also the crispy baby squid, fantastic. Service was just fine. Lively but not loud. Would be happy to go back.
3
Only realised that menu price on website was outdated during payment. Budget for business dinner not met due to this.
3
Agree with many others here that it's too hot to dine as seated outside. I'm are there inside tables but not many. The food is nice and it's a great place if out of town guests would like to taste local food. I definitely there are more comfortable options Not rushing back
5
Our party of ten enjoyed an excellent meal last weekend. The pepper and chilli crabs were both excellent, tasty and served hot as were all of the other dishes. The serving staff were attentive and quick to please. Most importantly we were surprised at the overall cost which was cheaper than what we were expecting. This is an excellent venue where the food quality has improved significantly since our last visit. We will definitely be returning in the near future
2
Weather is hot and was not given a place inside. Received a missed call which was to inform no table for inside. I called back but no response, how to know? Was only informed when arrived.Requested to change at least twice the stained cutlery. Ice water was slow in servic
4
Chilli crab - good recomendation
Services should be improved from the site of chinese mainland staffs.
4
We did not have crab but fish and scallops. Original recipes and good atmosphere. Staff was friendly and professional. A good place to eat fresh seafood!
3
Food was consistant with previous visits. Quite good but quite expensive.
Had small/medium sized orders for 6 persons - one crab, one fish, one crispy squid, one prawns and cereal, one vegetable and one fried rice. 6 lime juices. came to around $350.
5
Great place for family meals or groups of friends. Their chilli crab is AMAZING and make sure you sip their steamed bread buns into the sauce! Also the sweet and sour prawns are a winner as well as their fried rice. We kept going back again and again
4
I believe that it is the best chilli crab in the city, even better when eaten with their special buns.The fish is very fresh and deliciously prepared.The service is good, the ambiance is nice, but it is not cheap, so I would recommend to ask for the price when it says "market price
3
I reserved a table for 2 at 7pm via "Chope". The reservation system was very prompt and gave an automated reminder about the reservation. The restaurant called 10 mins prior to the timing to confirm again and also inform that we should finish our meal at 8:30pm. Upon reaching, we were given a small table nearest to the main door. The server put up a sign to inform that our table should end by 8:30pm. I informed that the food is not served and so we should not conform to such timing. Quality of food was not bad, but the prices that they charged diminish the value. The worse part is we were seated under a huge air con compressor and IT LEAKED water!!! It leaked onto our food, as we were about to finish, we did not make a big fuss over this issue. Restaurant was very very crowded on a weekday night. I advise diners to make advance reservation if you really want to try the chilli crabs. Do ask for prices before you get a shock of your life. Just go once as there are better places with better quality chilli crabs with a much lower price. This place is mainly for tourists with loads of ca$h to $pla$h
5
We had gone to the Clarke Quay Jumbo the day before and enjoyed the black pepper crab. We decided to follow suit with chili crab but at The Demsey Hill location. The ambience was nicer. We arrived early and were seated right away. Although the first table we were offered was not in the ideal place, they were accommodating in allowing us to change to a much more satisfactory location. The chili crab was outstanding as attested by many others. Richard was our server. He was extremely friendly and attentive. He made us feel welcome immediately. Service was excellent. We met a nice couple and began chatting with them. We were not rushed at all.

Ate here with 8 colleagues after an all day meeting. It was a 30 minute taxi drive from our hotel on Sentosa Island and when we arrived, we were glad that we had chosen an inside table as the humidity outside was brutal.The interior has no great decorative merit but we were quickly seated at a round table with a lazy Susan. The staff were a complete mix of young and old both male and female. Whilst it appeared that about 10 separate people were serving us - everything arrived in a timely fashion except 1 dish of prawns.We ordered a variety of starters, mostly seafood but included were some delicious lamb chops. All the starters were excellent.We followed this with large dishes of the house speciality - crab. We ordered it in 2 forms, cracked black peppered crab and the signature chilli crab. In the oplnion of the entire party, both were outstanding. Several desserts were on offer, however most chose ice cream. As ever in Singapore, the cost of the alcohol was very steep.An outstanding mea
4
Booked the restaurant to celebrate my mother's birthday.Ambience was good. We choose an indoor table which is spacious.Food wise, not too bad. Portion was appropriate, quite expensive though.Service wise, waitresses are walking around. However, it would be good if they are more spontaneous in refilling the tea, clearing and changing the plates, etc
5
We wanted to try some Chilli crab in Singapore and a friend suggested us Jumbo. Price is reasonable and not too expensive. I have to say that the chilli crab was the best crab that I ever had. The place was very busy and full and we had to wait for around 10 minutes. The area is very nice and has a lot bars and other restaurants. While we were waiting for our table we just grabbed a drink at a bar nearby. They called us when the table was ready. When we arrived we were not sure what to order and the waitress suggested some famous nice dishes for us. She recommended the Broccoli tofu fried with seaweed that tasted different and good. It was also the best tofu that I have ever tried. Chili crab was the best. The black pepper crab is also very famous there and we will definitely try that it next time. If you haven't tried the chilli crab then you should try this first! Will definitely go back
5
As expected, best chili crab ever!
It was our wedding anniversary lunch date, and as expected the food is fantastic!
4
Went to Dempsey Hill as a guest and tried the shark fins soup, chilli crabs, black pepper crabs and scallops with yam - all extremely tasty , prompt service in a charming area. Definitely get the chilli crabs over black pepper crabs !
4
I was here with bussines partners. we firstly enjoyed the atmosphere and the service.
Secondly but not the least the food. Very flavoured and jice to share with your table partners.
5
Food serving was fast and staff were attentive.
Crabs were very fresh!
Chilli crab was a little too spicy for our foreign guests last night though. But perfect for spicy food lovers.
5
This is my first time to visit Jumbo restaurant to eat chili crab. The chili sauce is a little bit spicy but sweet. The chili crab was the best food I've had in Singapore. I strongly recommend experiencing this food.
4
Since Chilli Crab was the touted dish, I decided to go for it. It was very good, spicy. It was difficult to dine alone because the smallest crab was enough for too. It was also is difficult to eat without making a mess, so do not wear white to dine. I started with the jumbo fried shrimp on sugar cane skewers. They were also delicious, especially with the accompanying chili sauce; however, the shrimp meat seemed processed. The buns also... you guessed it ... good! The one fried and one steamed left me asking for more; they are small. Ultimately, I preferred the steam, since the last fried bun I had was too oily for my liking.The seating seems to be geared toward large parties. Most of their tables (indoor and out) are round tables that seat ~8. The service seemed very slow. At the end, I just grabbed anyone I saw walking by to provide more napkins and more buns. It is possible that the time affected service since I was there between 9:30 and 11pm. They seemed to be closing around 11pm although I was told they said open until Midnight
4
We visited for dinner, a group of 10 people including 3 young children. The food was delicious, the chilli crab definitely lived up to expectations. The staff were also very welcoming of children, a high chair was available and they brought out rice for the kids to eat early as well as small forks and spoons. They didn't serve ice-cream which surprised me but they didn't object when we brought some ice cream from Ben & Jerry's across the road for the kids to eat.
2
Had to make a dash to the much talked about Jumbo Seafood @ Dempsey... and I did not think anything of the food, ambience and service.The chilli crab was nothing to write home about and the service was so poor. We were left waiting for over 20 minutes for an order of buns and when they were ready, we fetched them ourselves from the waiters station. I doubt if I'd go again or recommend to anyone
1
I think the food is overpriced and the quality is just standard, a lot of better places than this one. They close at 3 pm but if you come at 1:30 will rush you to eat. they clean my table while I was eating at 2:30 and hand me the check at 2:35. 25 minutes before closing, I think was very rude. So don't come after 1:30 you will have a bad experience.
3
Having expressed a desire to eat chilli crab we were promptly taken by friends here. Now I remember Dempsey from 10 years ago as a furniture warehouse and nothing after dark - but now it's a nicely lit happening eating area with nice restaurants. Jumbo is a big name and I have eaten several times at East Coast. This venue is nice with outdoor seating and fans for the humid Singapore evenings. Food was good and as expected. We ordered Alaskan crabs but I miss the Sri Lankan crabs we used to eat. Service was a bit slow with a long wait between the steamed buns reorder.
1
we need to call them everytume to get attention..no worthful...as we are foreigner, i feel treated us differently...so poor quality service..wont recommend to my friends...
1
Asked to leave by 19:30.
Fried Fish Came out 19:15, which took 40 min.
Lobster Salad came out 19:25 which took 65 min.
Poor Service.
3
Service was great, lives up to Jumbo's reputation.alfresco dinning, enjoyed the ambience after sunset. Plates were stained with black specs due to haze after leaving them exposed in the open air, requested for a change and staff promptly adhere to our requests. Staff even off the fan for us because it was hard to light up the candles for the birthday cake. Remarkable service. Food however was quite disappointing, other than the crab. For example, the fried baby squid was more hard than crispy. In my opinion, NRSCC jumbo branch made better fried baby squid. Crab was fresh and huge. Place was fully booked on a weekday so do make reservation.
4
During our January stay in Singapore we partook in an orgy of crab .... We each had two huge crabs - one cooked with pepper sauce and the other with chilli sauce - a Singapore signature meal. WOW ! Cracking the shells revealed delicious crab meat and we both had sauce over our fingers and running down our chins - that's what the bibs are for. Very friendly service and recommended
4
We choose the set menu for pax of 4 at S$268++. The Boston lobster and Chilli crabs that we had are fantastic! The seafood are very fresh and taste good. The yam paste is also very delicious! The only slight disappointment is the XO otah prawn fried rice. The otah and fried rice doesn't really blend in very well. Taste is alittle funny if you do not fancy coconut. Rice is too chewy and hard. Overall, the food served are good.
4
Nice location to get some drinks before the dinner and then jump into this seafood restaurant. Suggested to see the around of Singapore in a pretty and historical place with old military barracks re-used to host restaurants and bars. Jumbo seafood is just one of the best in town with crabs and lobsters in XO taste
2
Unwelcoming greeting. Seems you need to book a week in advance to sit indoors. Service was odd. Waitress kept telling us to order the small portions (s,m,l available) even though there were 4 of us. Food was mediocre and luke warm except for the steamed buns. I've had better Chilli crab in Hong Kong! Wait staff were rushing around like headless chickens and was difficult to get service for more drinks etc. To top it all we were sat near two large wheely bins full of theirs dirty laundry. We won't be going back there
1
Was with my hubby celebrating our birthdays. I made an advance booking on chope, requesting for a conducive corner. The seat that was arranged was right in front the bbq kiosk. There are no fans that were directly blowing at us on the relatively warm night. As i am pregnant, I was sweating buckets and we did not really enjoy ourselves. To give them a Star is already a flattery
4
Ingredients were fresh, good was tasty and service timely. Just wished ventilation was better. Parking was easy and it was set within a good selection of food and retail outlets. Considering our climate, would be good to look into some ways of cooling the outdoor seating areas
4
Reservation is a must. This restaurant was packed. We relied on the server to help us navigate the food. We had greens. Prawns and sweet chilli crab their messy fun signature food. Would definitely go back to try other selections. Service was very good. My only complaint was that the Singapore sling was way too sweet and low on alcohol. That aside, enjoyed this restaurant
4
Must visit place for the tastiest crabs in town (truly the tastiest in asia). My favorite - pepper crabs. Chilli crabs are good too.
Had some prawns, and deep fried fish, both good but can't really remember how they tasted. Crabs here are amazing.
3
Good for entertaining foreign friends, at a charming location. However food is average and overpriced. Go for the crab experience but I'm not convinced on quality or price.
4
Saturday dinner with family - intergenerational.
Nice food and ambiance (starlit alfresco), although waitress could be more attentive.
Nevertheless overall pleasant experience.
Thanks!
5
Service was impeccable as usual, lived up to the jumbo reputation. Food was delicious and the crab was fresh and yummy!

Dinner was delicious.
Very very good service.
I'd really like to come back next time
Thank you~~~😘👍❤

Went as a party of four and ordered a variety of items of the menu. Best was the pepper crab so would highly recommend trying it. The setting of Dempsey Hill is lovely and the place was packed so pre-booking is advised. I do think the staff need some extra training in this place as they were not very attentive and didnt even give us enough cutlery for four. Would go back but only because the food was nice
1
On our visit here, one of the items we ordered was the Kung Pao Prawns stir-fried with dried chili. The taste was overly sweet with lots of burnt particles in the sauce. Worst of all were the prawns - they were soft and mushy. Obviously, Jumbo had chosen to use inferior quality prawns in this dish which they had charged a premium for. It was certainly a let down as one would expect a higher standard from a seafood restaurant.
4
We were taken to this branch of Jumbo by our Singaporean friends. Food was tasty and served in comfortable surroundings- I recommend the signature chilli crab eaten with"mantou" which are shanghainese style buns that can be either steamed or deep fried, perfect for mopping up the rich eggy chilli gravy. Other notable dishes included marinated jellyfish, king prawns fried in oatmeal
5
The restaurant staff members are attentive and patient. Service is fast and responsive. The food is excellent. The Chilli Crabs is wonderful! Other great dishes we ordered are Mee Goreng (Malay fried noodles), steam fresh prawns, black pepper and honey lamb. Overall very happy and satisfied. Highly recommended. As compared to Long Beach Seafood resturant which I have reviewed separately, Jumbo is many notches above
4
They know how to cook their crab! Pepper crab was quite spicy but we didn't care. The plate was clean in 10 minutes. We ordered other seafood dishes and all I can remember was that they were all good. It was the crab and the cereal shrimp that were most unforgettable. You can buy a box of the cereal mix for the shrimp to take home
4
We enjoyed the recommended "Jumbo" crabs over the Sri-Lankan and Alaska one. Shell is much easy to crack. Tasty curry crab as well as the fried version.
4
Food are delicious and nice environment, services are good, waiter and waitress are kind and helpful.
3
crab not fresh. ask for indooor but given outdoor seats. was seated near the rubbish bin at first. not very pleasant.
4
Staff give good recomendations, service was quick, food was delicious.
Don't be afraid to order exotic food, staff tailors to your budget
4
Interesting place with lots of local. you can eat inside and outside. the food is really good, especially if you like seafood
4
Chilli crab here is ok. The beancurd with spinich , fried baby squids are also worth trying. Although this place is full of tourists, as a local, i would say the food is of reasonable standards.
5
No wonder Singapore is known for its pepper chilly crabs, this place is probably the best place to have them. I ordered a 500gms live crab, they make it fresh and you can choose which one you want as well. The menu is pretty extensive and dempsey hill itself is a nice and quite place in the heart of Singapore. Loved the ambience of the restaurant and the service was spot on too
4
My son, who lives just round the corner to this restaurant, took us there for a genuine chinese eating experience. We had some dishes that I've never tried before, Chilli Crab, Prawn in a cereal coating (delicious), Deep fried Mini Bun.It was excellent. Family friendly (my 3 year old grand-daughter was looked after very well). Lovely meal. If the locals go there, it must be goo
3
Came here for lunch to get our chili and pepper crab fix. While good was good enough, the general attitude and service was really poor. Waitress told my friend to "wait your turn" when she asked for water. They forgot our fish order, even though I asked them to check on it 3X. They need to get better service staff and not treat their customers like they are disposable
3
Admittedly we didn't order the signature chilli crab dish as it was stinking hot and I really didn't want to don the plastic gloves and pliers and attempt messy crustacean surgery. Our fish dish was nice and the buttery egg prawns OK. The seafood fried rice we ordered was forgotten and came at the end of our meal once we asked after it. Staff were friendly otherwise.
4
It has a nice environment. Easier to reserve seats as compared to the east coast branch. Food is reasonably priced and delicious. Chili Crab is a must try and it is their speciality. Will not regret going
5
Good food. Prompt service. Great experience.
Family friendly place and easy to find parking spaces.
Highly recommemded
3
Was there for lunch on a weekend. The restaurant wasn't crowded but service on the floor was inattentive. We had to ask for change of plates, tea was not refilled, collected our bowl but did not return with a clean one.
4
The Singapore chilli crab was to die for.. Great setting at night with lanterns and view of the city.
4
their service wasn't so good, but taste is so nice! try black pepper crab & bumboo clam, & chili crab.
3
We came here for one reason: chili crab. As a party of 2, we were able to get a table without a reservation, although we were here very early for dinner. There was quite a wait by the time the sun had set and we had finished eating.Seating is outside, which was challenging for me as I hadn't acclimated to the climate yet. Service wasn't very attentive- I waited 10+ minutes for refills of water multiple times. The bathroom was adequate but not what I would expect for a restaurant charging these prices. But the chili crab was so delicious, once it arrived, all of the other annoyances went away. Make sure to get the little fried bread balls to soak up all the chili sauce & crab that collects in the bottom of the pot.5 stars for food and 2 stars for slow service & just adequate facilities = 3 1/2 stars, rounded down
4
Was here for dinner. A reservation is a must as it can get quite crowded. The food is good and I would highly recommend getting their steamed fish on top of their chilli crab. Their black pepper crab is also very nice and has a nice spicy kick to it.
4
Good service and easy wait staff. We generally prefer to sit inside but sitting outside to dine under the stars is just as nice. Pricey but the food is generally of good standard. Look out for the special promotions on wine pairing when you are here. There can be some hits and misses in the seafood (depending on who is cooking) but you won't go really wrong here. I find this place quite comfortable to entertain overseas guests and older generation. Be sure to make your reservation. This place is packed almost every night of the week
4
The black pepper crab, crispy baby squid, scallop yam rings, seafood fried rice, fried mantou and sambal kangkong were excellent . However the steamed prawns with minced garlic which we ordered turned out to be different: the dish came with egg-white and fried garlic. The description in the menu failed to match the food they cook
5
This is the place you where you can have a good meal while surrounded by a pretty lit up place on a hilll surrounded by large trees covered with colorful LED. The chilli crab are excellent as in rich in taste but it is not too spicy. Add the gravy with a fried mantou or even a fried rice and you will forget how much have you eaten! Additional dishes such as cereal / herb dipped prawns are also popular and tasty
4
Jumbo crabs always my favourite dish. Great for a family gathering.
But feel the price of the crabs has gone up so much. Hope they can be cheaper.
5
The pepper crab was fabulous! Best in the town. Service was fast and environment was marvelous. Price was reasonable and value for money.
5
Dempsey hill branch is another choice for your dinner at jumbo, it's not too crowded and good service and nice atmosphere.
3
The restaurant setting is just really weird. I was offered a balcony table which I thought was suppose to be romantic, but then the balcony was also for tea making, dirty dish stacking, with a big fan blowing my long hair everywhere. Really not ideal..
3
Food served v slow
Vegetarian set not good
Vegetarian set forgot to serve dessert until almost leaving, request to serve all dessert as all watch the vegetarian to eat but rejected .....
5
Pepper and chilli crabs at Jumbo Seafood is a must try in Singapore. Need to book 1 day in advance and show up on time :)
5
Always one of the BEST meals we have in Singapore.... TIP keep it simple... Chilli Crab (A MUST), Pepper Crab if your more that 2 people and the fried buns to dip in the chilli sauce that comes with the chilli crab.... Experimented with other items on the menu before sometime disappointments.... It's a undoubtably a great restaurant... we might just not have a taste for the other items on the menu.... great wine selection.... good prompt service.... It's not cheap but well well worth it...

No doubt the food and menu are great. Love the chill and black pepper crab. Drunken prawns fantastic. Only annoying thing is the way Tiger Beer jugs are continually picked up to TOP your glasses up so that you will buy another. Just stop it!!!! Rest fantastic..
5
Made a same day reservation and managed to get a table for 3 sitting outside. We ordered the baby squid and the salted egg yolk prawns both small sizes. Both tasted very nice. We also ordered 2 chilli crabs (1.8kg in total!!) and 10 fried mantou. The chili crab is very fresh and the sauce is very tasty! Somehow the 3 of us managed to finish everything and we left the restaurant very happy
5
Good restaurant with reasonable prices. Food is fantastic and you can miss the crab. It is spicy but delicious. Try the 2 types : with Chilli and black pepper. In case of doubt try the black pepper, not so spicy but the taste is unique. Good to go with family and share dishes
5
The crab was as good as usual.
the fish yet a little bit hard.
coconut drink is cool and nice.
warm service too.
4
Had a family dinner. Love the usual black pepper crabs, scallop with yam, steamed bamboo clams, prawns and Mee goreng. Food is consistently fresh and good. Service is good too.
4
Great for a group of people, round tables for 8 to 12.
Chilli crab is a must, the rest of the food is great too. Dont forget to order Fried Buns to dip in the Chilli sauce.
3
Great chili and peper crab, awesome taste as always. Though the service could have been better. Food for the 4 people did not arrive at the same time (time gap of at least 20 minutes).
4
Went there for a Christmas eve lunch. The set was very affordable for 3 pax considering its jumbo. You would expect to pay more.
Service was fairly attentive and the food was up to expectation. Superb.
5
the crabs here are amazing. especially the black pepper crab. the chilli crab is great too with the fried buns. I'm not a fan of their mango pudding though and book a table indoors for better service.
4
Made an advance reservation for a family celebration. The place was crowded due to the festive season. Good food as always.
5
Can never go wrong with the seafood at Jumbo. I think they serve the best black pepper crab anywhere. The atmosphere is always fun because it is always crowded with seafood eaters from locals to foreigners alike. Try the dough fritter with shrimp paste this is also my favorite here. But for sure must order the black pepper crab. Super goo
4
My wife and I were invited by friends to this famous seafood place. It's located close to town and the parking is free, quite rare in Singapore these days. The place was packed so a reservation is highly recommended anytime you're planning a visit there. The seafood range and quality is really good, befitting the Long Beach reputation. Service is quite average, as with most big seafood establishments in Singapore. Prices are relatively high but we did get good quality. I know we'll be back there with the family again soon
4
A trip to Seafood Jumbo is always about the Chili crab but try the Black pepper as well, it really is good and often overlooked. Great service good meal in a bustling restaurant on Dempsey Hill. Give it a try use the bib and the gloves for the full experience. Enjo
5
I have been here many a times over the last five odd years and this place is just awesome.
The Chilli crabs and Pepper crabs were awesome
The service is very good too
5
nothing to complain about. Food is excellent but pricey. Service is great. Good ambiance.
also assisted in getting taxis without problem.
The crab dishes are tasty but again, quite pricey.
5
As expected.. Great food and great service rendered by the restaurant. Best of all, the Chilli crab and the famous Hor fun if you know how to order it.. Hahah.. (Trade secret)?

A simple lunch amongst lush greenery in Demspey. Food is normal and satisfactory with nice presentation
4
Three of us went to Jumbo Dempsy bringing a btl of vintage Champer, which costs $30++ corking fee. We ordered the $288 set for four, and two additional appetizers of jellyfish salad and Vietnamese style shrimp skewers on sugar cane. It's the holiday season so we are out to celebrate and have generous appetite! Jellyfish salad is rather average and overly sweet, but the shrimp skewers are succulent, tender, and perfectly deep fried. Fish mew, scallop and shrimp soup is mildly seasoned and delish. Salt and pepper Boston lobster is spot on. Braised abalone and Japanese shiitake with spinach is beautifully done as well. The star of this meal Chili crab is so yummy that even though at this point we are already quite full, no crab piece was left behind. We wrapped up the meal with mango pomelo dessert and took the silverfish fried rice home. What a fabulous experience and we will for sure return soon

Jumbo Seafood has a chain of restaurants which is gaining a good reputation for fresh, delicious seafood dishes. We went there for a family birthday dinner. We were given a private room, and a waitress was on hand all the time to serve us. We were very satisfied with the various dishes ordered. We had crabs in two versions - chilli and pepper. Both were great. The restaurant was packed that night. Make sure you make a reservation before you go
4
We went to Jumbo last November and it was fantastic. We believe the "must-try" dishes are: black pepper crabs, bamboo clams, fried rice, baby kailan. Very chinese, very delicious. Just remember to make reservation in advance, at least 1 week, especially at weekend, as they are always highly occupied. The area was great for a romantic walk in the evening, but it was quite inconvenient to get a taxi from there. You may want to have someone from the restaurant to do that for you. Just tell them you are a tourist and you need help. Singaporeans are very friendly and reliable. It takes around 10 mins to get there from Orchard Rd
4
This is another family-style place (Lazy Susan tables) and we were lucky enough to have a local with us to do the ordering. Singapore’s signature dish is arguably Chilli Crab and this is as good a place as any to give it a try. There werer a lot of other interesting things that showed up, including fried tofu, fish bladder soup, fried baby squid, and fried prawns in cracker coating. Everything was delicious, if not unrecognizable to a western palate. We had fun trying out unusual things (me moreso than the wife). There are several Jumbo locations throughout Singapore (including a couple in the quays downtown) so you don’t need to drive all the way out to Dempsey Hill to enjoy the food. Definitely worth a visit, if only for the Chilli Crab. But do try stuff off the rest of the menu as well. Recommended
5
Have eaten here many, many times. Always perfect crab....I love pepper, my partner loves chili. We are never disappointed. It will not be cheap but it will be a memorable experience. Not much ambience to speak of but then again it is not about that. It's all about the food. Perfect deep fried buns and delicious garlic kan kong. Wine is expensive here but it is expensive everywhere in Singapore so get used to it. A great feed, memorable and incredibly satisfying.
1
Was there celebrating but guess it is better to go to proper fine dining in future.Waiters are not attentive to our requests. No one help to open our wine bottle, and we even have to fill our own wine glasses which can stand there empty for more than 10mins .Food was okay though
5
Great food and great experience. We enjoyed the chili crab as well as the black pepper crab. The salted egg yolk prawn is very delicious. The service is fast and courteous.
5
Food was excellent! Service was excellent! 12 of us had a good time together. There was nothing more we could ask for! Thank you so much Jumbo!
5
The chili crabs were fresh and mocha pork ribs were excellent. Service staff was attentive and great
5
food is wonderful and service is warm.
crabs are chille yet yummy!
drinks are also nice.
And it is not so crowed on weekends!

Jumbo seafood is such an institution that trip advisor has no power over them. Nevertheless tonight's dinner was disappointing for a couple of reasons:1) we had no reservation but despite there being plenty of empty tables were waived to a terminal to enter our details including phone number so they could SMS us a queue number!Once we had done that we were shown to a table - they did not even wait for the SMS to arrive, they were just skimming phone numbers. That really offends me. 2) outdoor seating is cooled by Aircons and by high fans to the point that it was surprisingly chilly. If we had wanted to be cold we would have taken an indoors table. 3) service was appalling - slow, forgetful and occasionally overly friendly in that way tourist places sometimes are. Two of our ordered dishes never arrived and nobody ever poured tea or checked on empty glasses. Credit card took almost 15 mins to come back for signature. Overall if you want jumbo avoid Dempsey.
5
I had been recommended to go to one of the Jumbo chain in Singapore, and was really happy that I had done so.The restaurant was set in an area that seemed be surrounded by other restaurants and fairy lights and decorations.It was very busy.We ordered the chilli crab, some prawns and the most lovely yet simple green vegetable with garlic and ginger.The meal was truly memorable, and the service great
4
My 12 year old son has been on a rampage to try different types of crabs. We brought him here to sample the black pepper crab and the chilli crab.He absolutely enjoyed the black pepper crab! He originally thought it was under-rated and said there was too little gravy, but after eating a few pieces of the crab, he announced that it was very good. It was sweet and spicy at the same time, and the flesh could be extracted easily.The service here was excellent. They gave each diner their own washing bowl, and came round to tie our bibs for us individually. Dishes did not take long to be served and changes of plates were readily carried out.I bought the Jumbo membership card for $20 and promptly received a $22 discount for the meal. Looking forward to our next visit here, probably during the CNY period
4
I have been to Jumbo many times before and had tried the various outlets but I always come back to Jumo at Dempsey. We had to book a week ahead to get a table.The chilli crab and salt and pepper crab were excellent. So were the stuff yew-tiao and veggies, all washed down with the refreshing coconut juice. I have tried chilli crabs in many places in Singapore but alway come back to Jumbo.Service was good although we needed to chase up our dishes once or twice
4
Taken here for a large business group dinner. Quiet private room made it possible to talk. Liked the overall energy and that they had outdoor eating also. Mainly went for the spicey crabs - a local favorite. I preferred some of the vegetable dishes - crabs were a little difficult to eat. Great wine selection at mid price range
3
Service was certainly lacking and sully. We had to ask for our order at least twice or 3 x before it was served to us. at one point, server told me I have to wait for my chopsticks that she cleared together with my spoon and plates as she has to serve the food first. She replaced everything but the chopsticks and I have to wait for it. the steamed fish we ordered was over-cooked and we replaced with another crab that we had to wait for 25mins. However, a part time uncle server, RICHARD saved the day. He was responsible for another section but checked in on us and attended to us when we waved for attention. He even went in and brought the beer out for our guest when he heard we were still waiting for it despite a reminder.
4
Food was awesome. Service was great as well. No complaints, really. Except that it might be a little on the pricey side but hey - it's Jumbo and the location is central.
4
Staff were friendly and helpful. Crabs were good as usual, but a bit too pricey. Easy parking at Dempsey.
3
The service is quite good, but the food there was actually not as good as I expected, excepted for the chilly crab is quite OK.
5
We had great night there. the food was great, services was great as well. They helped us calling the taxi back to Hotel. it was so nice
4
Restaurant is always busy so book a table. Chilli and black pepper crab fantastic. Drunken prawns awesome. Service decent. Only issue is always trying sell you more and more jugs of Tiger Beer. Can be a it annoying. Certainly worth a visit. Overseas friends love it.

We recently had a business dinner at Jumbo Seafood. We tried to make a booking on line without any success. We phoned and were able to secure a book, however 30 minutes earlier than we wanted as they needed us out by 8.30pm. At 9pm we were finished our meal and just sitting chatting and there was no mention of them needing our table. Its a very big restaurant and I was surprised for a Wednesday night it was extremely busy.The menu has a number of great looking and sounding dishes on offer. Unfortunately one of the things we wanted to order, clams, where not available.We had a number of dishes and there were all very tasty. The seafood rice was amazing
3
Went to Jumbo Seafood for the first time after making some money off it's IPO.Ordered a Fish and 2 medium crab (cooked chili crab style) and 5 bamboo clams for a total bill of $400. Price is not overly expensive, at most 30% more then the other famous crab restaurants in Singapore. Crab meat was dry and sauce was nothing special. the rest of the seafood was good but grossly overpriced. (paid $100+ for the fish)Service however was excellent, servers were attentive and helpful
5
We heard about this institution and booked for dinner to try the famous Chilli Crab in Singapore and were not disappointed.I left nothing on plate and those hot little buns to soak up that wonderful sauce and eat were a treat.Price wise it was reasonable and I look forward to the day I can go back.Great food highlight !
4
This is the first Jumbo restaurant without the 'water front' experience that I ever visited. Something missing from the experience somehow. The food is no difference to the other Jumbos, the chili crab with mantou bread are still the must try. To be fair, the location is not bad either..a restaurant complex in a peaceful Dempsey street area, although not so easy to reach without cars/taxis. Decent option afterall
4
We ate here on a busy Friday night in Singapore . We booked online for 10pm, but arrived early and the staff welcomed us with open arms and showed us to nice table outside on the terrace .There is a very good menu here with a vast selection of tasty dishes, many of which we had not tried before . We had the prawns in Egg and Salt , a medium portion which consisted of a generous 12 large shell off prawns which were delicious and cooked perfectly . We also shared a small portion of Seafood Nasi Goreng , which was also tasty and very generous . We wanted a taster portion of the local delicacy Crab in chilli sauce rather than ordering a full one just in case we didn't like it . The restaurant accommodated our request, even though it wasn't on the menu , and we enjoyed this as a starter to share with some fried buns . The sauce was absolutely delicious and a combination of sweet chilli and Satay ..spicy but gorgeous and next time we will order a portion .We would definitely recommend this restaurant for its good , friendly and very accommodating service as well as its excellent food !
4
Nice ambience and environment around Dempsey to chill out after lunch, plus the food was just great here!!
4
Book early, even for a monday it is quite crowded
Service was not good as expected, as we have to keep getting the staff attention
4
It is one of our usual dinner options for a "local" dinner date. I like it because it's casual and I have a few favourite dishes like the Bamboo clams, the salted egg yolk prawns, and sambal kangkong. The steamed cod is also very nice.
4
We come here often to celebrate special occasions. This time round we were given one of the private rooms, which was great as we were celebrating 3 birthdays. Service was attentive and flexible. Chili crab was, as always, very tasty.
5
The Canadian pepper crab was the best!!Service excellent no corkage charge.scrimp was very fresh.Outdoor atmosphere was pleasant. I have been going to this restaurant for 25 years.
4
Jumbo is known for its great food Chinese style; great for a team dinner and family party; Dempsey is one of the best
5
Free carpark and good service; quiet and cosy. What can you ask more?
Perfect! The waitress and waiters are patient.
5
Great service and food. Definitely going back soon.
Look for Mdm lau, attentive to customer's needs.
1
Where shall I start....half the dishes we tried to order were unavailable. Cereal prawns horrible- cereal was like sawdust. Chilli crab sauce was basically tomato and salt. " Steak" wasn't even good enough to give to the dog. And there was a dead fly in the Chili crab too....don't go. Staff were excellent which was a nice surpris
4
This is a great and very popular place! The different types of crab are amazing and there is a lot to offer in the menu.TIP: make sure that you book a table in advance, any day of the week, as this is really popular and usually fully-booked!Food: great food! Of course, people come to get CRAB! and the crab is delicious. I personally prefer the BLACK PEPPER CRAB! I find it amazing and more balanced than the Spicy Crab... but it is worth trying both. Make sure to order the Man To (small buns)... steamed or fried. Food overall is delicious and will make u want to stay longer and eat more :)Venue: this is a good looking restaurant.... you might have to stay on the terrace as this place is super popular and might not have space inside. Prepare some napkins as the air is hot and wet... and the spicy crab make you sweat :)Service: Friendly and efficient... the staff has good advise on the menu and what to associate with the crab. Price / quality: great quality... so even tho I find it a bit over-priced, I have to admit that it is worth the trip and detour to get this crab :
4
Good food and great service. Chilli crab and pepper crab were outstanding. Dinning area was a bit messy but was cleared immediately when we pointed to the waiter.
4
A busy restaurant in a great location offering a wide range of delicious seafood and other locally inspired dishes. The pepper crab is great as are the pumpkin coated prawns. Recommended.
5
Absolutely wonderful seafood selection. We had the Black Pepper crab and Chilli Crabs and both were just delicious.
4
Chili crab is not as spicy as I thought, but still it is tasty. The dishes are worthy of the time waiting.
5
Great place fantastic staff and the food was sensational. If you are in Singapore you need to go here fo..lunchlunch or Simlunch.
5
It's a wonderful experience there.
My family had a really good luch ,with good taste of food and nice smiles on the waiter's face.
Will come again!
4
The food quality here, as always, is awesome, authentic and fresh. Pepper crab is a must! A great place to visit if you are from out of town, though getting a taxi can be difficult as the Dempsey Hill area is a little out of the way. Make sure you download a taxi app before you go, or get the restaurant to call one (can be difficult if they're busy)
5
We look forward to Jumbo on every trip to Singapore. We have been to them all and although it is a short taxi ride the one at Dempsey Hill is by far the best - much nicer environment and nice outdoor area. Don't forget a mixture of fried and steamed buns with the crab and the very expensive razor clams (from Scotland) are worth it (one each as big). Make sure you get the staff to book you a cab as impossible to just wait for one
5
We went here on a recommendation and we were not disappointed. Service was great and the food was just superb! The pepper crab was equally as good as the famous chilli crab. The tiger beer kept on flowing and it was a very enjoyable experience, highly recommend to anyone wanting to experience Singapore's famous chilli crab.
4
Inside was fully booked (because of the Haze but the fans outside made the seats almost perfect. The service was excellent (from the able Richard) who guided us through some recommendations. Chilli & Pepper Crabs were a great choice and the pumpkin prawns were an inspire recommendation. Overall, food and service & atmosphere were great, just thankfully I was not paying the bill 
4
In fact, the fried rice with chili crab gravy was the highlight, not thechili crab itself.
Also, kailin was amazing.
5
It was a wonderful experience with the attentive staffs! Definitely more visits in future! Thumbsup!
4
A little bit difficult to find the location and the taxi driver needed to call for assistance. It's very popular so that we could only eat during 6 - 7:30pm. The chilli crab is good. Steam fish is not bad.
4
The place is worth to reccomend as it has everything what good restaurant has to have: very good seafood, nice view and nice service. You have to go by car there but there is no problems to park it outside the restaurant. Area is very nice for just spending a time with family - nice boulevar sourrounded by sea and park
5
If you are looking for Singapore chilli crab, this is the place. Freshly caught well prepared and portions are huge. The highlight of my visit and dinner was Richard Uncle. At 70 he is super energetic and makes you taste the food before it actually arrives on your table through his excellent sales skills and there is warmth in every word he speaks. Look for table no 111 and you will find this young at heart man complete your meal with genuine hospitality. He is the rock star of jumbo.
5
Went here for dinner with 8 other people, 4 of whom live in Singapore. .best place for Chili Crab and Pepper Crab! Steamed buns and fried buns are delicious. Had the jellyfish, too -- which looks like translucent vermicelli noodles...LOOL..and tastes very ild, so you add gipping sauce to it. Dessert was some sort of chilled pink melon soup. Great service! Lots of fun!
4
Brought my friend from the United States to Jumbo@Dempsey for lunch. We had one Chilli Crab, one Black Pepper Crab and six deep-fried mini mantous to soak up the delicious chilli crab gravy. Jumbo Seafood's crab dishes are always consistent and never disappoints. I would go to Jumbo if I want to eat good Chilli Crab dish. I've already been here three times. Some tips: 1) always call ahead to book your table, dinner is usually busy2) you can BYOW, no wine corkage fees
4
We booked this as neither of us had tried chilli crab properly yet. The crab was amazing - the tasty sauce coated everything and the meat was succulent. Our friend is vegetarian and she said her dish was also very good.Service was fast but a little hurried and the waitress didn't seem to have a lot of time - it was full though. We went mid-week so I'd hate to know what it would be like at a weekend
4
Stopped by again. My Singaporean friends ordered various things for the table. Some sort of fried scallops that were good. Had some sort of fried Talapia that wasn't bad. Chilli Crab was the dish of the night. Huge crab! I could have eaten that dish all by myself but had to share. Claws were monsters. Very yummy and very messy!Only issue was the AC was leaking on our table, they turned it off but it did not get hot. Maybe the draft Tiger could have been a bit colder as well.Will be back soon, I may order 2 orders of Chili Crab just for me
4
Every visit to the Little Red Dot isn't complete without a trip to Jumbo. The Dempsey branch is located in a quaint area (you'll need a cab going here). Best to book a table online at least 2 days in advance (maybe even earlier if you plan to go on a Sunday). Ambiance is pleasant but do try to go here for dinner so it isn't as humid.We've tried out other crab restaurants but it'll always be Jumbo for us. Crabs are succulent and cooked perfectly. The other main dishes are also just as good (don't miss trying the prawns in salted egg. Delish!)Service and serving time from order does need to improve...by a lot. And I hope the do it ASAP
4
We came for the well-known chilli crab. Jumbo Seafood@Dempsey was the only outlet which could make online reservation for next day. Not so many people as expected, and dishes served fast. The chilli crab was awesome, totally worthy of the journey.
5
We only managed to sit outdoors on that evening. It was not too hot with fans. We find the food very tasty and good. Service is very good.
5
Black pepper and chilli crabs are both very delicious!
Mee go reng is also very good seafood , very spicy and delicious!
Jumbo seafood Dempsy hills has a good atmosphere, so we always make a reservation using your system, thank you!
5
I like the place and so has every guest that I have taken there. You don't have to have the crab as there are lots to choose from. Their dishes come fresh and hot. You never leave disappointed ! my overseas guests now always ask me to take them there
2
My partner and it tried the restaurant and there were many issues. We had to Share a table and the annoying part about that was we were seated first by over 7 minutes and we were served second after the two other people sat at the table. Bad management skills if you ask us.The food for the price was a rip off and we would never return again. Place is over rated and needs to have a reality check. The lead waiter is rude and needs to be shown how to service customers. We believe he may be racist just by his manners towards westerns.Glad the experience a over
3
This is one of the places that everyone says is a must do. I think that the food is Ok, as you get to taste the Chilli crab or pepper crab, but I found it to be over rated... I did not find the food to be amazing, the place is always very full, so service is average, and thought it was expensive for what you get. I prefer to take my guests to a hawker centre
5
This whole area is great. Started with a few beers at a micro brewery that I've forgotten the name of and then here.Three of us had Pepper Crab and the biggest Talipa I've ever seen.It was fantastic. All cooked to perfection in a truly unusual setting. Felt quite un-Singaporian!If I'm lucky enough to return to this wonderful island I'll definitely be visiting here. Fantastic and highly recommended
4
We were invited to Jumbo by friends - they know my love of crabs (chillied or peppered). We were not disappointed; ordered a mix of different dishes and of course the chilli crab. Food was very good - even if they actually forgot the cod fish we ordered alonside the crab and other dishes. Its a lovely setting if you can get a table on the terrace.(book 5 days ahead..). Personally I think it lives a lot on its name - I have tasted good (better?) chilli crab in other Singapore restaurants for a fraction of the price. If you have a discount card it makes a difference to the bill ! So - Pricey for what you get - but the location, ambiance and surroundings are top for an evening with friends
4
Black pepper crab never disappointed me! Mocha pork rib was equally amazing too.The downside is that the price increased quite a lot compared to my previous several visits. Also the strong wind from fans (since we chose to sit outdoors for more nature experience) made dishes cool down fairly fast. :
5
We wanted a quick and good quality and authentic seafood lunch and this delivered.The quality of the food was excellent. It was freshly cooked and arrived at the table still steaming. The prawns, venison, vegetables and seafood rice were all excellent. We had to sit outside as it was very busy but it didn't matter.Thanks - I would recommend this restauran
5
Fabulous and yummy fresh seafood ... The salted egg crab was just to die for! Steamed prawns, noodles and more!
5
Book in advance, I went there with the intention of sampling chilli and black pepper crab it was as expected ( excellent ) give your self enough time to have a walk around Dempsey Hill worth the walk
5
Nice food. Good service. Good location.Will go there again next time. Suitable for couple, family or friend gathering.
4
It is a rather reputable restaurant which runs a reward scheme for members. They are very good with their seafood dishes and also the lamb chop but I was rather disappointed with their chicken dish. It is a must to try their yam paste dessert which was superb.
3
We made a reservation in advance a few days before our visit. Actually we were planning to have dinner at Jumbo Seafood Riverside, but unfortunately the restaurant was full booked. So we decided to have lunch on Jumbo Seafood Dempsey instead as it is the nearest Jumbo Seafood restaurant to our hotel.We arrived there a bit too early so the staff ask us to wait for about 10 minutes as the restaurant opens at 12 am. While we were waiting, there were only 2 - 3 groups of people (also waiting for the restaurant to operate) so we wonder if we really need to make a reservation first. But when we finally get to our table inside, almost all the tables have a name plate on them (meaning the tables have already been booked).Jumbo Seafood had always been famous for its Chili Crab & Black Pepper Crab so we decided to order both (there were 4 of us). Aside from the crabs, we also ordered roasted duck salad, crispy baby squid, deep fried beancurd, and some mantau buns to eat with the crab sauce. We also had chinese tea for drinks.Review for the food :Actually I had better crab dishes than the one I tasted here, but it doesn't means that Jumbo Seafood's crab doesn't taste good. It taste good, but just not that great. Maybe because to my Indonesian taste palate, the chili crab weren't spicy enough. But other than that, the chilli crab tasted pretty good.As for the black pepper crab, it came out to be too salty so we had to send them back. But luckily the staff managed it well and sent it to the kitchen to be fixed for us. The black pepper crab came back pretty tasty after the alteration although it lacks in sauce.Surprisingly, the other dishes are the ones that amazed me. The Roasted Duck Salad was very refreshing. Deep Fried Beancurd was crispy on the outside and have tasty filling. And my favourite is the Crispy Baby Squid. It has this sweet and savoury taste and its really good when eaten with steamed rice.Review for the service :Our lunch here was a pleasant one. The staff and waiters were friendly and helpful enough. One of the waiter help us with our bib (for eating the crab as eating crab can be very messy). They also quite quick in serving us the chinese tea when our cup is empty and also when we ask to have our plate change. You can also ask the staff to call taxi when you're done eating. Overall the service here is good.Tips when dining here :- Reservation is necessary- Be prepared to pay expensive bills (we spent about S$ 200 for 4 of us)- Peanuts will be offered to you and it actually will be charged so if you don't want to eat it, just say ''no thanks''- Ice water are free so when you feel thirsty but don't want to wait for the hot chinese tea to cool down like I do, just ask the waiter for some ice water- When you have choose one to try between the award winning chili crab or the signature black pepper crab, go for the chili crab (tastier in my opinion and also have more sauce to eat with the mantau buns)- Must try the Crispy Baby Squid- When you need taxi to get back to your hotel or other destination, ask the staff to call one before you actually finish the meal so when you have finished, you won't have to wait too long for the tax
5
We visited this place to treat friends from the U.S. I've been to many chili crab joints, and me and hubby agree that this place serves the best chili crab sauce. So yummy! And best is the service we got from the staff, I didn't get her name, the auntie who goes around was very attentive to our needs. The cereal prawn is also so yummy
3
We visited it on the recommendation of our hotel as a seafood best Resturant , it is ok for the Chili crab we order but other than that not that good and service is very slow , they try to help on under standing their menu but there English is not that good, I can said it is only good 
3
Over the years the quality of the food has deteriorated but the prices have risen. The chilli and pepper crab remain firm favourites but there is an extensive menu for fish and seafood lovers. At weekends the service level can be slow and it can get very noisy in the inside air-conditioned segment. A reservation is essential
4
Food was made more enjoyable with service from this staff Kelvin! We were seated at the terrace on Sat 25 Jul & crab was one of the food we ordered. He took the initiative & helped us to put on the bib when our crab arrived. Everything that we ordered was very yummy, but the highlight which was the crab was a little disappointing. They ran out of Sri Lanka crab & we had to settled for a slightly more expensive crab which was not as succulent. Overall jumbo is one of the seafood places I will return.
5
I love this place and always will go every time I am in Singapore. It also has emotional value to me as I have been going to the Jumbo East Coast since a child. Definitely the you tiao and the black pepper crab are must orders for everybody. The consistency in the food is also great and the atmosphere of outdoor dining makes everything perfect. I think it is best for family settings with everybody getting their hands dirty and licking the pepper sauce off their fingers. Love it. Only slight complaint would be that I have noticed the staff lacks fluent English speakers. A lot of the staff are now PRC which can make communication difficult when your Mandarin is choppy
5
Would recommend jumbo to any seafood lover!😍👍 everything on their menu is incredible but ofcourse the chili crab is a must try!

Slightly pricey but they serve up great seafood. The Pepper crab is amazing for those who have a palette for spicy food. A pity I couldn't get indoor seats!

1st time using Chope to make reservation n it's thumbs up! Food is average n a bit pricey but the servers are polite & I was pleasantly surprised being given a rm for 8 paxs! :)
5
Perfect place (Dempsey) & restaurant (Jumbo) to enjoy Singapore's Best Chilli Crabs. Simply love Jumbo's superb service too !
5
Very naice place and an excellent choice of sea food tray teh Pepper and Chilli crab perfect but if you dont like the Crab the other seafgood is excellent as well a real recomendation

One of the best nasi goreng I ever tasted and wonderful chili crab! We had dinner on the terrace which was very nice too.....

I've probably ate at Jumbo a hundred times over the past 15 years. There's definitely an air of mediocrity and price gouging that didn't used to exist. My beloved chili crab is the saddest tale- always trying to switch you from fresh Sri Lankan crabs to mushy, previously frozen Canadian (Dungeness). Save yourself the $78/crab and just go somewhere else. Add to that facilities that get more crowded and dirty everyday day and there's not much charm left.

a really nice place for seafood lovers. visited this restaurant at dempsey hill, Singapore. we were four and did not have a reservation, but were lucky enough to get a table. we ordered some broccoli for starters followed by black pepper crab, garoupa, egg coated prawns, some chow mien and boiled rice. what a great meal, everything was excellent. ambiance was also very good and variety of drinks available, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, was also nice. a great place to eat sea food while in Singapore

Partner and myself went to Jumbo Seafood and ate outside. We had lobster and dragon fruit and prawn and sugar cane for entrÃ©e. We then had pepper crab which was very spicy which we like. The chilli sauce and buns were not spicy.We gave 4 stars for the food but three for the staf

Referred to Jumbo restaurants as having great chilli crab. Went on a Sunday night - the rush had gone, but the remnants still remained on empty tables.Ordering included asking about utensils to crack crab shell. "No" came the reply. Seemed odd, but decided to order anyway. Husband ordered whole fish. We also ordered rice, which we never received.Got a bib and a hand towel each; no shell cracking utensils (and none offered), and the crab came with one large silver serving spoon, that's all. Husband was given chopsticks and an asian soup spoon for his unboned fish.No chance of getting the attention of a waitress for our rice or any other utensils.We noted that the couple at an adjacent table also complained about not getting the rice that they had ordered (prior to us giving our own order).We ate and left quickly, having had to grab a staff member on table clearing duty just to get extra hand towels so we could clean up.The chilli crab was nice enough but I had to fight the crab with hands and teeth in order to get to the flesh. My husband found his fish had gone cold while he picked away at the flesh with chopsticks, separating the bones.Suggest the more residential location of this outlet had something to do with the lack of service and care factor. Maybe the Jumbo outlets on Riverwalk and the Quay are more tourist friendly - ie. actually provide service rather than slapping a plate on the table and walking away
4
I've been to various outlets in Singapore but never to the Dempsey Branch before. The decor is better than some branches. The service was efficient. My favorite is chilli crab with mantou. I will be back.
5
Excellent food! Very good service. Can go with big groups and there is a marvellous outdoor space to enjoy food and the excellent weather of Singapore.All crab dishes are excellent and if you like spicy there are couple to choose from.Other local dishes are also excellent

I made a reservation for 6:30pm as my guest was craving for crab. Thought Dempsey will be a quieter place to take tourist for seafood. We turn up at about 6:20 and front reception saw my reservation at 6:30 and simply tell us we've to leave the table by 8pm. Then abruptly took us to last table outdoor seating without asking us whether we prefer outdoor or indoor? Before we took our seats, she put a card on our table which show clearly "we've to return the table at 8pm". That was enough to turn us off. Luckily, they employed waiter Richard. He attended our table immediately. A senior uncle who can't speak Chinese, Richard was very kind and cheerful. He brightens up our mood immediately. The Yam with scallop and drunken prawn were very yummy. Service was very fast (probably they're trying to kick us out by 8pm). They've wine promotion. I wonder whether they might realize they would have to give away the wine free since they're so keen to kick customers out on a weekday evening. Overall, the food is good and serving is just right for small portion to be shared amongst 3 pax. But I would not be back again
5
Enjoyed an absolutely amazing dinner here with friends. The customer service was top notch, and the chili crabs were to die for. We also enjoyed the bamboo clams and other delicious seafood. Everything was fresh and very well cooked. I'll be back there on my next Singapore visit
1
Went to many Jumbos, unfortunately the experience in Dempsey wasn't favorable. No one was bothered to attend to us when we arrived even with reservations made. We had to go into restaurant to look for someone else after 6-10mins of wait by the line, and few staffs even ignore our presence. Some dishes took over 40mins to serve and not at right temp coz left on serving trolley for some time before being brought in to table, few dishes wasn't hot.All in all it was the service which spoilt the dining experience. Will still go back to jumbo but definitely not Dempsey Jumbo
4
Prices are slightly on the high side but food quality is above average. It is worth it to join as a member of the Jumbo restaurant chain as you will receive a free cake or voucher for your birthday month plus emails on promotion items. I particularly like their one dessert dish - yam paste with Gingko nuts, which is superb.
5
Had another great seafood dinner with the family - right from the nicely chilled mango duck salad to the baby squid and cereal prawn - especially good was the venison with ginger n spring onions with a rich meaty flavor - good offset to complement the seafood - and the fried rice with silver fish was divine. Then came the main course - our two crab dishes: chili and pepper - both were great! Wife thought the chili crab was awesome - better than most - don't disagree. No room for dessert but the Or Ni looked really good - another time
5
Fabulous chili crab... at an affordable price. It's high up to go there. Former Dempsey Barracks are quite a long way uphill and once there, the restaurant is not easy to find. Go with a local if you can.Its all worth the search. The crab is just perfect. Great service and splendid seating outside. There are other Jumbo Seafood places in town but the one on the hill is much more "agrÃ©able"..
4
The food was good. Atmosphere was quite nice. Service was a little slow but is acceptable as it was full house. Please call early to reserve as it was fully booked. We called in the morning for a dinner reservation and only got a table for a 9.00pm reservation. But we went about an hour earlier and they managed to get us a table within 15 mins which was much appreciated.
5
There is only one word to describe the pepper crab here and that world is Yummy. I prefer the pepper version to the Singapore chilli crab. The restaurant is always full. You need to book in advance. The service in the restaurant is average. The ambience at best is acceptable. The food can be described as angels copulating on your tongue. We also had shredded veal and this was delectable.People say there are better crab restaurants in Singapore but I have not been to a better one. There is something creamy and peppery about this crab. All visitors should try this preparation
5
Went here with business colleagues. Amazing food! Tried both the curried crab and peppered crab. Both were fantastic. Can't wait to go back next time I'm in Singapore!
4
Excellent chili crab
Service was effective and courteous
Can be a bit noisy
I think price is too high though
4
What superb crab in a superb setting. Thank you tons frank who brought me here. But I will be back. The staff are really attentive and happy and everything was wonderful. We will be back.......
I said that 14 years ago.....!
4
The restaurant environment and furniture is pretty average however what we all have enjoyed is the food which was quite excellent but also the service which was very professional efficient and smiling.
5
If you want grab, jumbo is the place too be! They have for me the best pepper crab in whole of Singapore! Curry crab and the fried bamboo sticks as well as the drunken shrimps come highly recommended!!

Our family of 4 had booked a dinner last Friday night at Jumbo @ Dempsey as part of a series of "farewell makan trips" for my daughter who is heading off to Canberra for her 3-year university studies in July. We made an early-ish booking and arrived at the restaurant at 6:45PM, which was already bustling with diners. Whilst the restauarant offered both indoors and outdoors, I was very happy when we were told us that they have given us an indoor table ... but my happiness was - alas - shortlived, as the air-conditioning in their restaurant is almost non-existent. Had I known better, I would have simply opted to be seated outdoors as when we finally left after about 1+ hour, the weather outdoors was cooling and breezy!Thankfully, the food came at intervals that were not too lengthy and in general were all yummy ... except a couple of dishes fell below our expectations - such as, the salted egg york prawn - whilst the flavour of the salted egg york came through in the creamy sauce, the overall taste "kou gan" fell short. The black-peppered crab was of a generous size but the claws should have been properly cracked as it became a struggle for us get to the meat with the filmsy tool provided.During and at the end of the meal, we all agreed that this would perhaps be our first and last visit to this branch
3
We were excited to try this restaurant regarding famous Singapore chili crab and black pepper crab. The place is very expensive, even though it doesn't look like a fancy restaurant. Their special chili crab and pepper crab are OK, not for the price they charged us
4
Had the chilli crab with friends. Which was beautiful and the price was reasonably cheap for Singapore ($68 for crab). Had to wait for 30 minutes but was worth it. The place was clean and the girls on the floor were nice, this place is a must be on your list...
5
We visited which restaurant several years ago along with my coworkersWhen I ate chili crab of local specialty I'm really impressed flavoring Especially fried rice with chili sauce..Every visited Singapore must take chili crab even if there is no timeI think it is most delicious food abroadThanks ..
4
Chilli crab was good though the Sri Lankan crab was not available on that day so we settled for Canadian crab. The gravy is especially yummy to eat with the fried man-tau. Salted egg prawns was so-so. Must try the crispy baby squid as appetizer! Will go back again if we're in Singapore
5
One of the nicer place to enjoy chili crab with nice ambiance! Reservation for this restaurant is recommended as it does get packed after 7p.m on weekdays and 6.30p.m on weekends.
4
Very good food with goos service. However the indoor seating was fully booked. It is too warm to be dining outdoors
4
Fantastic variety in Chinese fish dishes. All well preparred and many options in the way you want the fish to be cooked
4
This place is really good with its seafood dishes and particularly its crab preparations. If you like spicy, go for Pepper crab and if not, choose chilli crab. Thoroughly enjoyed the crab.
The rest of the food is also of good quality.
4
Singapore family visit to this famous restaurant was a great night putt ginger crab, don't think can be bettered anywhere, the salt and pepper eqaully delicious. Toget
4
The chilli crab is to die for! We ordered 3 x 700g between 3 people. We could have got away with only 2 considering we had a large fried rice as well. We were absolutely stuffed by the end of it. Really good value for money
3
During my first stay in Singpore I visited Jumbo at Dempsey. Very Nice locaton yet en wa wit lots of various restaurants with good paking facilities. Jumbo apparantlyknown as best in town, somewhat disappointed vs my maybe too high expectations. Service on an average level and quality food/ crab OK but highly priced
4
Arriving just in time for lunch, we did not make a reservation so we were relegated to outside al fresco seating. It was a bit warm since the noon time sun was glaring but we were eager to try the chili crab. Thus, we bucked the heat and settled down.We ordered a slew of dishes ( see photos below ) and we were a party of four (4) with one kid. The drinks arrived without hassle. These were cold so as to aid our already warm seating location.We ordered:- Chili Crab- Yang Chow Fried Rice- Cereal Prawns- Salted Egg Prawns- Tofu with Spinach and Mushrooms- Scallops with YamThe food was yummy and the crab was somehow better that we tasted it at the ClarkQuey branch. The Yam with scallops proved tastily sweet which just complimented the Tofu with Spinach & Mushrooms.The Cereal Prawns, for me, was the best I ever tasted in Singapore. Not that I am a Cereal Prawn expert..or that I ate at maybe 6 resto's in Singapore but the cleanest and best tasting Cereal Prawns, for me, is at Jumbo Dempsey Hill. There was no salty and sea taste to their prawns. It was crispy to perfection and made our lunch really flavorful.The Salted egg prawns also did not disappoint as it gave a right ooompphh to the meal. The Fried rice was decent and yummy as well. Having said these, except for the fact that we weren't able to get seats in the air conditioned area since they were all reserved, the warm ambience was negated by the good food. This branch is worth going to since it has a typically smaller crowd. a tourist will have a bit of trouble going to this branch vs. the touristy ClarkQuey branch. Inspite of it's location not being easily accessible to tourists, they were fully reserved for the lunch. There are also many restos and cafe's beside Jumbo. Dempsey Hill is a cool place to visit if you want a relatively reserved and relaxed afternoon
1
The service was simply poor. The dish of fried noodles had a piece of broken glass in it and the staff just simply apologized with a plate of fresh fruits and we had to have a series of arguments before the manager even consider giving us a discount when in fact they should have waive the cost of the meal, considering that their food preparation is so poor in standard that they did not even realize a piece of broken glass was in their noodle
3
We have been to two of the Jumbo restaurants in the past few days, and the food here as well as at NSRCC, near the airport, is good. The NSRCC branch seems slightly cheaper, as well as less crowded.Favourites include the mee goreng, chilli crab with fried mantou bread, scallops with asparagus and crispy baby squid. Try the cod fish in sambal too - it's delish. Don't bother to order the golden chicken though - it was disappointing. It did have crispy skin, but it's actually not chicken meat but fish cake underneath. As it was the Chinese new year, we had the yusheng or salad with salmon, which was nice. Fortunately, my sister had a voucher otherwise we would have had to shell out $48 for the dish. Service was quick and attentive both times, though there was a time limit due to the next seating 1 1/2 hours later
5
Smooth booking via Chope. It's easy to use and also easy to make changes without calling. The food was great and the service waiters were very helpful. Thanks.
4
U loved it except for the nuts they offer which are probably complimentary but I got charged for them. My advice is don't accept anything they offer unless you don't mind otherwise you will be charged for it.
5
A fish restaurant with a lot of Buzz! The experience is just great, with sea food that was the best I have tasted since I visited Jumbo's on the west coast two years ago!The way they cook crab is just out of this world, its tasty, messy, and great fun. Thank goodness the waitresses put a Jumbo bib on you and change the finger bowl, plates, and clear the mess every few minutes. Try the Chilli Crab, or the Salt and Pepper Crab its the best in Asia
4
Food as always was absolutely great, especially the black pepper crab. But the amount of customers compared to the amount of staff makes it very difficult to get anything ordered. Being spoiled living in BKK where the situation is the reversed, i think Jumbo should up their game and ensure better/quicker service
5
great seafood and efficient service. The pepper crabs were a first for me and easily the best crabs i have had in my life. the prawns and venison were also out of the world. Thankfully their last order can be stretched to 10:30-11pm, unlike a lot of other restaurants there, which take their last food order before 10pm
4
A great restaurant for seafood in nice location. We ate prawns and squid with chilly, crab in pepper and various other dishes ordered by friends who live in Singapore. Bibs are useful when dealing with the crabs. I have no idea of prices as we did not pay but i am sure it is reasonable and would defo go back
4
Haven't been to this one before on previous trips, but found the restaurant to be serving up the same quality dishes expected at the other Jumbo restaurants I've been to. Service was very good as always, but didn't like the fact that the waitress was trying to push 'Canadian crab' over mud crab. When I asked if it was dungeness crab, she more than happily claimed it was. Wasn't really sure what 'Canadian' was and the waitress couldn't tell me to my satisfaction either. Based on past experiences I stuck with mud crab and think I've done well. We had two crabs, one in chilli and the other in pepper. Again, both did not disappoint and found the pepper crab to be hotter. Cereal prawns were OK, not as good as I remembered and the specialty, minced chicken dish was good too and can see the time and effort in preparing the dish but nothing outstanding. Overall food was pretty good and probably will go back, but I don't think I'll be craving Jumbo's.
1
We ordered the usual crab, fish and other dishes. The quality screams "central kitchen". You can taste the sauces out of the plastic bags and not freshly chopped minutes ago. The quality of seafood is as good as heartland hawker centers, not really restaurant standard by far. Do note that Jumbo was the only loser of 3 "Gordon Ramsey hawker hero cook off". Which emphasizes my point that this is more hawker standard than real restaurant (losing also means lesser standard)
5
This place has been recpmmended by singapore based friends. We enjoyed a nice black pepper crab....it could not have been more delicious. Upon checking the bill we noticed that they charge us 1.50$ for the peanuts that were served with the drinks. We never ordered these nuts and thought they are complementary. This was the only drawback. U should book your table since its a very popular place
5
We had the chilli crab, drunken prawns, seafood fried rice, tofu hot pot and the seafood chicken skin dish. In all honesty, a beautiful meal. Best Chilli crab we ever had....not too spicy and not too sweet. We used all the deep fried bread to soak up the delicious crab sauce. Plus they tie a bib on you to prevent those big splashes on your top and even a special cloth bag to protect your handbag. That's what I call thinking of absolutely everything. Cost was ok. What you expect to pay. My family did not like the drunken prawn soup due to it's slightly medicinal flavour....similar to the dong quai flavour used in Chinese herbs but I loved it.
4
Surprisingly got a table quite easily on a Friday night.
Service was a bit slow. Food was great. Prices are not on the cheap side.
MIght be cheaper places to get chilli crab but at least the quality of food was consistent.
5
there are no match for chili crab in singapore if u try jumbo chilli crab and must order fried bun to match the chili crab sauce....
4
Lovely seafood at a location with ambience.I particularly liked the chilli crab and the shark fin soup with crab.
5
I loved it here and it is by far my favourite jumbo in Singapore. Great food and great customer service received. Highly recommended!
3
This has been one my most disappointing visit to a restaurant in Singapore. I have been to Jumbo East coast as also to Jumbo Clark Quay. Both of them were if not exceptional but they were good and service was exceptional. But the one at Dempsey was on the wrong foot to begin with. Stewards taking the orders were lost and unhelpful. The pepper crab was average and being asked to crack it the waiter expressed its unwillingness and did not even bring the crackers. We had ordered fried black pepper crab,COD fish, Sambala praws, steamed rice and fried rice. The items were delivered exactly in reverse order without coordinating their delivery. The only item upto the mark was Cod fish. Rest were just average. Even the jasmine tree was stone cold. All in all we could not wait to get out
3
Part of a small chain which is known for it's chilling and black pepper crab.Just as well we made a reservation. We arrived on time but were requested to finish our meal by 8 pm. This gave us a couple of hours to order our food, get served, eat and leave. Honestly, although sufficient time to two hour time limit put a bit of a damper on our meal.Food wise, standard Jumbo fare but I reckon that the crabs are getting smaller whilst the price has increased. :-(. Service was excellent and the ambience time pressure aside, was conducive to conversation at a decent level.Food aside, my preference would still be their outlet at East Coast
3
Very well known local seafood .If you are grouper more than 3 or 4 be sure to book.Apart from seafood they do some very spicy lamb cutlets which are more the size of a chop.They are renowned for there chilly mud crab.The service is impeccable .It was not bad food , but not magical . Might be one of those places you need to try for yourself as we all have different taste buds 
5
We had a large table outside, definitely a great idea. Nice selection of seafood and other dishes and everything was great - no disappointments. They promptly come around for more food and drinks orders, nice bowls to clean up your hands after crab & similar. Definitely a place I'd return to 
4
Chilli crabs have gotten a lot of international attention lately, so on a one day visit to Singapore my wife and I had to try them. After commenting this with our friends who live there, they immediately said that this was the place to taste the dish. We went to the restaurant for dinner, and it did not disappoint. The Chilli Crabs were great, but probably even better was a signature dish they serve called Black Pepper Crab. The service was excellent, as the waitresses were very attentive, and put bibs an all of us, and even gave us zip locks for our cell phones. Except for the claws, the crabs were hard work to eat, and certainly messy, but worth all the way
4
Great place to have the Singaporean signature dish Chili Crab which is made by frying crabs with a fragrant red sauce. You get a nice bib to protect you from red sprinkles on your shirt. Additional to award winning Chili Crab they have all the seafood you can imagine. My favorite is the Geoduck Sashimi, the Drunken Prawns and the crispy fried baby squids.Make sure you reserve on the weekend and request a seat outside if you can't stand Singapore ice cold air conditioning
4
Jumbo is a must try for the chili crab and the cereal prawn! Nothing comes close!
Nice ambience,very attentive staff and delicious food justifies the pricey menu. Jumbo should be part of every visitor's itinerary in Sg.
5
Chilli Crab is a Singapore dish everyone has to try. If you try it here then you won't be disappointed as the food here excels !! Enjoy !!
4
Fantastic location, charming place with absolutely the best Chili Crab I have ever eaten.
Outside dining gives the place a top ranking.
4
Recently went to both Jumbo and Long Beach restaurants in Dempsey. Can't tell the difference between the two restaurants for Chilli crabs! BUT, you can tell a lot of difference between the two restaurants for Pepper Crabs! Jumbo has great pepper crabs - not too oily and taste wonderful. Long Beach's pepper crabs are too oily and wet! Two different world!I also prefer the "environment" and the service of Jumbo! They are fast, efficient and attentive. Can't fault them in anything really! Overall experience is good
4
Good service.Impressed the restaurant to the extra mile to "cover" up our personal stuff in case the "splash" from the Chilli crab sauce: 1) my mobile phone is placed in a ziplock bag; 2) My bags are covered with a cloth; 3) we each have a bib tied around our neck. Also liked the quick and seamless reservation from Chope which helped to organise and make my reservation quick. Liked the ambience as well. Except the fish dishes are really quite costly which is more worth to concentrate on the crab dishes instead. Will visit again :)
5
Decided to try this famous Jumbo seafood restaurant on Friday night, with family of four. It was fully booked for the night but thanks goodness, there is one table reserved for 8.30pm seating, hence our 6.30pm arrival can fit in one more dinner round for that table.Ordered a less commonly known pepper and salt crab (as my kids cannot take spicy), vege, fried baby squids, scallop in mini yam rings, two coconuts. All dishes were deliciously cooked. The crab was freshly sweet and meaty, well worth its price.In all, my whole family really enjoyed the wonderful seafood dinner in a very cosy setting and laid back ambience. Will be back for more
4
Nice chili and pepper crab. All other dishes is as good as expected too. However, plate service lady at this Dempsey outlet requires some training as they could have put down the plate more gently. The plate knocked against other utensil when it was replaced. Not sure it is a sense of nervousness or lack of training.
3
Getting tired of these restaurant all around S'pore. Can't complain about the food or the service, quick and gentle staff, food as per the picture in the menu, price reasonable. No fun, no difference to the other thousand places, no soul, no character, just another one !
5
We had lunch here recently as part of a family vacation. Our daughter who is a resident chose this particular branch of Jumbo because of the ambiance and good service aside from the sumptuous food of course. We had chili crabs, cereal prawns, fried rice, seafood soup and an appetizer ( sorry forgot what it was!). We brought 2 bottles of wine to go with the food. Surprisingly, corkage was free. The lady who served us was very attentive and friendly. We enjoyed our lunch thoroughly. Jumbo still makes the best chili crabs in Singapore
3
Went to dempsey area for another outlet opening and stayed until evening. Did not ate at Jumbo for some time and so decided to come by to try out their cuisine. Although the place is getting crowded, we managed to get a table.We ordered some dishes and informed the waiter that we preferred "less oil" and "less salt". But to my surprised the dishes were high with sodium and MSG. The seafood horfun (dry version) tasted and look more like fried kway teow. The spinach was overcooked and tasted salty as well. After meal, we have to drink mineral water to quench our thirst. The place seems commercialised than traditional classic food. The judgement is for you to decide
5
Very crouded because of many people like it. Extremely delicious. Better book in advance. A little noisy inside. If you can't finish you can ask for take-away)))
5
As always, Jumbo never fails to please with their delicious food with special mention to the chili crab. Service was very nice too (quite a little hard to find in SG), and the ambiance was much nicer than the other outlets.
3
i heard the restaurant is very delicious and good service
but i do not know why jumbo is famous.
yiu should better be interested in service and clean
why did you get the price of water tissue and nuts?
i don't understand about it
5
I've always been here with my families.. either just the few of us or in a big group..one of my most favourite food is the black pepper crab.. it's really really nice..!my daughter favourite food in this restaurant is chicken satay.., they serve it well and the meat very tender..other than those 2, the rest of the items which we tried was prawns, steam fish, seafood fried rice, chili crab, etc.. it's all very nice...if you think of coming here during weekend or even weekdays evening, better make reservation, as the place is always full most of the time on dinner.
4
The person who served us & attended was I remember called Roy as my reservation was booked on 5 Oct 2014 @ 12.45pm. Roy was excellent in serving us as it was also my wife's birthday too. When I mentioned to him, he tried to arrange for a cake but could not as it required 4 days notice, so he made special arrangements to let us hv an FOC platter of friends. Throughout our meal there, Roy was rather pleasant & professional. Because of his service, I signed up as a Jumbo member right away
4
The weather was hot that day, but there were nice shady parking lots near the restaurant; which was a bliss! The service was good, they handed us those extra serviettes and wet towels and little aprons.. (with picture of a cute crab) as we were going to savor chili crabs not with the fork and knife, nor the chopsticks...we were going to use our bare hands! They were finger lickin good. Had an enjoyable lunch, ordered dishes like tofu and cereal prawns etc. As usual this restaurant does good in service and taste. We walked out, planning our next visit...The only peeve, was that the crab dish could have a warmer to keep the gravy warm while we go at the crabs
5
Well worth visiting. Strolled around the complex of shops first before having a typical crab meal as recommended, washed down with reasonably priced wine. Taxi ride to get there, booked in advance, and we were happy to go to any of the other branches of same restaurant
5
Jumbo @Dempsey was able to accommodate 12 people although the reservation only had up to 10 persons per table. Mum was on push chair. Although we didn't manage to get a private room, we were given a table that comfortably sat 12 and was located near the main entrance. The portions were large and the service was very efficient. For a 8 course dinner, the first four came within an hour. Portions were big and so we were pretty full by the middle of the meal. We also brought our own birthday cake and the restaurant was able to deal with the extra requests.
4
Very famous restaurant with a few branches. Friends recommend this restaurant before I came to Singapore. The official website provide online reservation which shows their professional. The ambiance here is better than other branches such as riverside. Recommend to have seats outdoor. This is a nice area to enjoy the food. Very relaxing! Chili crab tastes really good. Would love to come back here among all Jumbo branche
4
This place can only be reached by car, therefore tourists need to take a taxi to come here. The ambiance was fine and not noisy. We have ordered the Chili Crab and Black pepper crab, scallops, friend rice, vegetables and tofu. All of taste really good, especially the scallops and chili crab. The crabs were big and not overcooked. I will come here again the next time when I visit Singapore
5
first I don't speak english well
compared with other jumbo restaurant ,dempseyhill store is clean,not congested.
needless to say ,taste is excellent ~!!*^^*
3
If you want to enjoy Jumbo, how about other branches like near changi airport or riverside. But one thing is good about other pubs or cafes near Jumbo.
4
Sea food is fresh,and service is very well.We were delay that day,but your restaurent was not deleted order.
5
We had the chili crab, the vermicelli lobster and cereal prawns. Food was great! You get pretty messy with the chili crab, but they have plenty of extra napkins...
5
It's a really nice place for diner during the weekend. Really love the chili crab there! Wait, and the signature black pepper crab!
5
Ambiance is good. Customer service is good. Food is great!
I find value for money with the quality of food served at Jumbo.
Dempsey Hill is a good location with very good flow of taxi available. Lots of nice stores around.
4
Nice place with a lot of crowd. Did not reserve, but still got a table. Very nice and helpful waiter, specially when the crowd got less. Allowed us to order a nice mixture and were very patient with us. Good seafood!
5
Eaten here many times and once again very impressed with the quality of the food on recent weekend trip with overseas family visiting. If you want a well priced high quality selection of good seafood dishes and you don't want to break the bank then this is one of the best options in Singapore outside of Hawker courts. Our personal favorites are the prawns with cheese (yes sounds strange but really works) and the chili codfish. Add in some noodles and rice and you can have a very good meal for 4 for around $100. We like the Dempsey restaurant as it always has a good atmosphere although it can be tough walking in at weekend if you have not booked
4
I have to say the restaurant was crowded but Dempsey Hill was pretty deserted. I was surprised with that but I guess there are so many new places in singapore that people would like to try... The food is really good in Jumbo in Dempsey hill, generally they do have regular customers going just to that particular branch. No question that you have to eat pepper or chilly crab, which is fantastic. The crispy fried baby squid is also one of the delicious dishes you need to taste. the third recommended dish will be fried tofu, which is also fantastic. I found the price reasonable fo rthe quality of teh food you will get

I've been to Jumbo Seafood at the Quay, but the branch at Dempsey Hill has a more intimate vibe. They also accept reservation. We ordered the banquet for four which was good value for your money. Definitely the go-to place for the famous Singapore Chilli Crab
5
An excellent seafood banquet for our group. Starting with lobster, the courses just kept on coming. Finally ending with Singapore chilli crab. Plenty of really good seafood. Highly recommend.

I ate two famous dishes at same time. Even the first time for all people will try chilli crab...trust me Thai would prefer Pepper crab...so let's try!
4
Everything we ordered was really tasty - steamed, Fried.... Whatever !! Liked the open air sitting too! Had a great evening! Service was good too ! Noisy though 'cos of the crowd... Good food
5
Previously, we always trooped out along the ECP to the huge seafood palaces there. They tended to be overly crowded and noisy and the service rather indifferent.We ate at Jumbo@dempsey inside as a family of six including one locally-born as our guide this night. It was great fun to put on the bib and don the gloves and get stuck into the delicious seafood.The keynote dishes of the night were chilli crab and black pepper crab. We also had whole fish done to perfection, falling off the bone.The atmosphere is of serious eating, so no one takes any notice of the dressing up and the messiness. It was a great fun evening capped by the great choices of seafood

Tried their Singapore Chili King Crab with buns. Super delicious. Apart from that the Seafood Fried Rice is a must try too together with the Crabs. Occasionally come to this place whenever i craved for Chili Crab! Perfect place for dine in with Family and friends..
4
Food was good--and just like many of the previous reviews, Chili Crab and Drunken Prawn were very good--didn't have a chance to try the pepper crab as wife couldn't take too spicy stuffs. We also ordered the seafood fried rice--which I thought was mediocre (Maybe, we should have taken the waitress' recommendation of salted fish fried rice.Was fortunate that when we visited this place--weather was very nice and had no problem dining in an outdoor area. Service was very good--nothing to complain about.It may be a bit pricey--but we thought we paid for what the place can offer for the price we paid.Early reservation is very much recommended

Located in a area with at lot of restaurants it may be difficult to locate this one, but when you enter you can either sit outside or inside with AC and as I'm not used to +30Â°C we sat inside, you will there have overview of the fresh fish in the tanks and you can see how they work in the kitchen. The menu cart is extensive and contains a bit for everybody. The fried baby squid were just a bit burned but the the rest of the plates were delicious, I will defiantly be back next time I'm in Singapore

I've been hearing about the infamous Jumbo Seafood for a while, so decided to finally give it a try. It really fell far short of expectations in most areas.Probably the most disappointing thing was the restaurant itself. The outside seating area looks great, but we opted to sit inside due to the heat. Big mistake. The benches are filthy and stained, the carpet is old and dirty, the walls are dirty, everything about it on the inside screams renovation. With the prices they charge, you would think they would re-invest in basic upkeep.The food was hit and miss. The cod was spectacular, the fried rice was acceptable, but everything else was disappointing. The famous crab was soggy and had little zing to it. You could have fried up some cod, drowned it in their sauce, and we wouldnt have known the difference.The staff were OK. One lady was nice and helpful, another waiter was irritated most of the time.At the end of the day, we won't come back as you really dont get value for money here. And if you do go, definitely sit outside ... weather the heat, trust me !

Being from Indonesia, I go and visit Singapore at least once every year. On each visit I make sure I eat Chilli crab with buns at Jumbo Seafood Restaurant. I used to go to the one on the Stadium complex before they closed, so this time my cousin takes my wife and I to the one on Dempsey at Tanglin Village.The atmosphere were different than their other outlets, it was more closed off, less windy. I ordered chilli crab, fried buns, fried shrimps with corn flakes, and steamed sea bass. There were four of us on the table, so please don't get judgmental on me. Each and every dish we ordered were amazingly delicious. Enough said
5
Chilli and pepper crab was really good. We ordered prawns which was also good. They serve these buns to go with the chilli crab and that too was delicious. The place gets really crowded during dinner even on weekdays, so better make a booking. The service was very good and fast despite the crowd
4
First time at Dempsey jumbo. Beats having to travel all the way to UDMC for the original. This is as good if not better and tastier.
5
One of the best Chili Crab in town. Just popped by last weekend and got our Chili Crab fix... with Bamboo Clams and Hong Kong Kai-Lan to go along. Perfect!
5
If your friends are true blue Singaporean and you love crab - this is the place to be - order the pepper and chilli crab and enjoy till your hearts content - just awesome ! It was more like a business /old friends dinner didnt have too much time to experiment - but the pepper crabs are to die for !
5
Good food and good company makes for a memorable experience. We had dinner here after a few swigs of sangria at the Italian restaurant in the Dempsy area. My friends highly recommended the famous Singapore chilly crabs. And it lived to its expectations! We also had drunken prawns as starters. The claw breakers can take some getting used to but they give each guest a disposable apron so don't be shy to a spill :

I'm sure if you're Singaporean, you're probably going to say you can get better elsewhere at some beach shack for a fraction of a price...but if you're a tourist, this can be quite an enjoyable experience..I used to be a fan of No Signboard and would order the Chili Crab every single time...during my last visit in S'pore I went to their other branch in Vivo City and although good, it didn't blow my mind away..I just couldn't leave and not have really good crab so a friend took me to Jumbo's...I'd seen the one on Clarke Quay and was hesitant at first since it looked like a touristy seafood spot...but the one in Dempsey Hill looked more like a casual high-end restaurant where both locals and expats ate...ordered a few items...to be honest, the shrimp and calamari were bland and I couldn't care less about it...the baby squid were quite good...and finally in came our Black-Peppered Crab (decided last minute to switch Chili to Black-Pepper)...WOW!...our table went silent while we munched away...it was just pure deliciousness...my friends said it was good but I thought it was the best I've ever had and that's coming from someone who's not a big fan of crabs...I probably licked the sauce off the plate and didn't care about getting messy...I was already getting full before the crab arrived but I still ate with great pleasure...I'd suggest going for the crab first, then get other items if you still feel you need to get more food, although it would also mean going for the best item on their menu first then order some other decent but not so great dishes..I am looking forward, or better said, longing to go back to eat at Jumbo's..

The Demspey setting is quite pleasant and easier to get a table than on the river.The crab is always delicious but the other sea food dishes, especially the pawns, all seem to come in a gloopy, floury crust, whatever variety you choose. The kai lan and other green veg are good, but in fact I think I prefer the Long Beach Seafood restaurant to the Jumbos. An institution for Singapore visitors though
4
Visited this restaurant three years ago and decided to try it again on this trip. It did not disappoint. We had chili crab, pepper crab, drunken prawns, scallops on deep friend taro paste, vegetables etc etc. Everything was good. Only drawback was everything came at once and we had to eat quickly. I guess they are so busy that they want you to leave quickly
1
Came on a Sunday night. Male service staff in black was rude and condescending. Took the wrong order and grumbled that we had ordered it when corrected. Cancelled order begrudgingly and yet it still appeared in our bill at the end of our meal. Would have expected more out of a restaurant charging this rate.Food was average seafood fare. You are better off getting your seafood elsewhere, like coffeeshops, long beach, ubin seafood etc
4
Visited Dempsey Hill for the first time and was really pleased with the restaurants on offer.We plumped for Jumbo and wasn't disappointed. People tell you that it's very touristy blah blah.. Which it is of course but it shouldn't distract from the very high quality of its food. Our main event was the pepper crab and it was amazing. The staff were very pleasant and the only overall minus was that the food came in a bit of a rush and all at once but I guess u get that with a set meal. Anyhow.. Good experience and will definately return to Dempey on our next visit
5
This restaurant was recommended to us by a friend. We turned up without a booking and were lucky enough to get a table outside on the verandah. There were two of us and we both had the pepper crab. It was fabulous. This was a wonderful way to spend a relaxed evening in a relatively quiet spot eating a Singaporean delicacy. This isn't a cheap meal, but it was very enjoyable
4
I had a fantastic dinner with a small group. The outdoor dining was a perfect atmosphere and the chilies crab and black pepper crabs lived up to the previously established high expectations. The black pepper crabs were my personal favorite.
4
In dempsey, where you will find various restaurants this is the place for outside eating of the famous chili and black peppered crab! Price is ok the food excellent!
4
The Singapore chilly crab is worth trying eventhough it is messy. Also try the BBQ whole fish worth the effort. Ask to sit in the patio area. The service was great.
3
Earlier in our trip we had dined at Jumbo's at Clarke Quay and were looking forward to ending our trip at Jumbo's.We had our concierge make a reservation at Dempsey. Even though the restaurant was empty when we arrived they stuck us at a table in the far back looking at the alley & service area. One would think since we were so close to the service area that our service would've been excellent for the night but it was very slow. Beyond the tea we never were asked for additional drink orders. We didn't get plates to place our used shells on. My husband accidentally spilt his lemon water and it took several requests for a replacement bowl.We ordered the 2 large Prawns for appetizers, Black Pepper Crab with sticky rice and Noodles and fried rolls. (We definitely preferred the Chili Crab from our first dining experience). The noodles were great.Not sure if it was an off night, this location or if we had rose colored glasses on during our first visit. But we definitely left with a less impressed than we walked in the door

Introduced to this for the first time, a seafood salad that you stand and toss high above the plate to bring you good luck. Sweet, nutty , crunchy and surprising, i thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes, we had chilli crab and yes, we had scallops, soup, duck and noodles, but the New Year seafood salad was best
1
I was there on a Sunday to celebrate my mother's birthday in advance. We arrived at around 11.45am and placed our food order at around 12.00pm. The ticket showed that the order was keyed in at 12.01pm. We ordered Chili Crabs, Sambal Kang Kong and Mee Goreng. After 20 mins, the vegetables were served. After 40 mins, still no sight of the crabs and noodles. I asked the waitress whether the crab has to be captured from Sri Lanka to be served? She checked and informed that the crab and noodles will be served after 5 mins. I got fedup and went to search for a senior staff, who claims to be a supervisor. He informed that crabs take 45 mins to be served and hence the long wait. I questioned him why the vegetables were served first then and it's all cold already. Also, why wasn't the noodles served at all? His answer was classic, "we only serve noodles after all the other dishes. If you want them to be served together, you should have informed us." At this point, I asked him what kind of service is this??!!! The only service recovery given was a fresh plate of vegetables. No discount whatsoever. Crab and noodles arrived shortly but the crab quality is bad. The crab is watery and does not live up to the Jumbo standards.Service:WORST ever! Seafood Paradise at the Flyer is wayyyyyyy better! Food served within 20-30 mins.Staff is untrained in service recovery!Quality of Food:Bad! Mee Goreng has lost its standard. Crab quality is watery! I will never visit this place again for the money I am paying.... I would rather go back to Seafood Paradise

My husband's friend's daughter treated my husband and I to this restaurant for lunch today, as her parents happened to be in town, and her company was going to relocate her to London in March of this year. We ordered seaweed fishmaw soup, chili crab and black pepper crab, fish, and 2 plain vegetable dishes, and man tou, and desserts. The chili crab is not really that hot. The soup was very tasty, the meat of the fish was very tender and the waiter reminded us that there were tiny bones in it, so be careful when we ate. The vegetable dishes were also just right to the taste. The man tou was also steamed perfectly. The food was served very quickly. The waitress was kind enough to ask the friend's daughter in the end if she was going to apply for their Jumbo rewards card. The kitchen closed at 2:30 p.m. but we were allowed to sit until 3:30 p.m., as that is when the lunch shift was supposed to end
4
I cannot remember when last I enjoyed a meal this much. The crab comes already cracked but there is still some minor work to be done. Utensils are provied and fun is to be had in scraping out the last gram of crab meat. It gets messy but that all added to the experience. We shared one crab between 2 people and the both left satisfied. Would love to try the pepper version next time.
3
Been here a few times, and this is my 1st review here, i think. There were 13 of us at the table and we ordered their set. Appetisers of bamboo clam and scallops with asparagas were ok, nothing fancy. The steamed fish was also so-so, though probably very expensive. The highlights were the crabs of course. I think Jumbo has 1 of the better chilli crabs in town, better than Long Beach and Palm Beach restaurants. Even the hot buns that you soak the sauce with are better. The pepper crab is ok, much like everywhere else. Service was average, they were very busy as usual, even on a rainy tuesday night, so you'll have to wait a couple of minutes to get service, but it wasn't too painful. Being in dempsey there isn't much of a view though, unlike the spectacular 1 Fullerton branch of Long beach, but that has poor chilli crab
5
Jumbo is famously known for its chilli crab in Singapore. However, it's black pepper crab is just as good. You can save a lot by joining the Jumbo rewards program (better than Long Beach restaurant). The place can get filled up during the busy hours so it is best to make reservations. Service is generally good. Would like to commend their staff, especially Ella and Dwi. :

We were a party of seven adults when we went to eat lunch at the Jumbo Seafood Restaurant on 5th November 2013. Since some of us are very small eaters, we ordered the fixed menu for 6 persons. This was sufficient to fill seven of us satisfactorily without feeling that we ate too much!The service was excellent. Very attentive and polite. We were offered disposable bibs several times to prevent soiling of our shirts or blouses (when cracking the shells of the crabs). The dishes came not long after we sat down.The first dish was the seafood soup with bamboo pith. Very tasty, not too starchy and the bamboo pith added a crunchy texture to the mildly sweet soup.The boiled live prawns were also very fresh! Having seen them being caught right from the tanks in front of us, they cannot come any fresher! Very delicious, crunchy, and well complimented with the chilled black, sweet sauce provided.Next was the stir fried Kai Lan with venison. Very tender meat, nicely marinated, and crunchy green Kai Lan.This was followed by the steamed live “Soon Hock” which had very succulent flesh, and was cooked just right garnished with deep fried garlic. What a texture and flavor!We had the pepper crab instead of the chili crab and was not disappointed. Nicely hot and spicy with pepper and the meat firm and full.The fried seafood rice was also very well done and the desert of iced mango sago with pomelo was so refreshing to close a wonderful lunch. Cost for the set menu for six was $268/- plus, plus.The restaurant is one of six outlets. Lunch here on a weekday is not that crowded, but reservations are still advised. The place does get very packed for dinner, as we have experienced several times before. The indoor air-conditioned sitting is not very large, but more space is available outside on covered wooden decks. Wheel chair friendly, and moderately low noise levels.A little pricy but the quality of the service and food, the ambiance of the place, make up for it. There are also credit card promotions and a Jumbo membership comes with discounts on the food.JUMBO@Dempsey. Blk 11 #01-16 Dempsey Road.

We Have some guests in town and we finally managed to book here for lunch as several branches were full booked for dinner for a few nights. Really surprised! I liked the ambiance inside the restaurant with tall ceiling and the live seafood swimming at the back of the restaurant. Waiting staff are very efficient and the price is very competitive. If you are a member, you get 20% discount Our guests love the chilli crab, cereal prawns which were very fresh and all the food here. Really impressed with the value! The surroundings is an old British army barracks - if you like such a location. It is not easy to access by public transport - take a taxi

Do not leave Singapore without trying the Singapore Pepper Crab and Chilli Crab. This is a must. Jumbo have several locations in Singapore. You can go to Riverwalk, The East Cost or to Dempsey Road. If you stay at a hotel around the Orchard Road area it is better to go to Dempsey road as it is not as far as East Coast or Riwerwalk. Eating Singapore Pepper Crab and CHilli crab is a must. Do not leave Singapore without trying this delicious food. It is completely a mess eating it, but the taste is heaven
5
This is one of the top places for chili crab in SG so we had to try it. unfortunately you have to get a reservation, so thru our hotel we were able to book an 8:30 slot. we got there at 7 and I noticed an empty table, since there were only three of us I asked if we could be seated and they accommodated us but said we had to be finished by 8:30.We got a medium chili crab and wine and vegetables. it was a 15-20 minute wait as the place was full. the crab just seemed to be full of meat! it was so good that we wanted to eat one more, but it was already 8:10. I asked the reception if we could try the black pepper crab but also asked if we could stay a bit longer. She said she would get us the crab and extend us to 8:45. the crab arrived at 8:25 and we polished it off in ten minutes. for me the pepper crab is better than the chili crab.we went to a nearby mexican restaurant after. dempsey is a good place to eat and relax
5
Great place for Singapore Chilli Crab, and more. Lovely place on tranquil Dempsey Hill. This restaurant is a bit more refined and personal compared to the larger, busier, noisier sister outlet on East Coast. Get a table on the wooden deck outdoors - recommended. Crab is the specialty, but basically mostly everything on the menu is delicious. A lovely place for a get together for family, and friends, where you can have good conversation over a great meal (without having to raise your voice over the din that you normally expect of a popular seafood joint. Best to make reservations - this place is really popular
4
Jumbo's seafood is well known in Singapore and the Dempsey location is a nice spot. The area is a lot quiter than other Jumbo locations in town which makes it much nicer in my view. The inside seating is limitied, but there is an extensive outdoor area.The food is fresh, taken from the live well tanks, and is always good. We had an excelent vension course as well as the must have Chili Crab. A nice surprise was also the cereal shrimp, first time having this and it was very nice.Give it a try and you will not be dissappointed
3
We were in a big group and had a dinner there. Online reservation was convenient. We did not bother ordering crab as it is too much work and not much food. Instead we ordered fish, shrimp, and some tofu dish, fried rice and noodle. Some people could not eat the noodle as it was too spicy. Each of us spent about 45 SGD and food was just so so. Service was not too bad. I guess seafood is always expensive anywhere. For better cost peformance, I would choose somewhere else for the next time
4
It was the occasion to celebrate wife's birthday with my parents, in laws and 3 kids. We chose to go to Jumbo at Dempsey for its central locale. Was glad to have made reservation online a day before the dinner which is on a weekday -- we were allocated a table within the indoor air conditioned area. Given the hot tropical climate in Singapore, air conditioning is an added comfort for us to enjoy our dinner. We ordered the set dinner for 6 persons, and top up with 2 ala cart dishes mainly for the kids. The food quality was very good - the steam fish was very fresh, and not forgetting the chilli crab which was rich and full of flavours, the gravy being mopped up by the deep fried buns. Service was good, I like the initiative taken by the waitress to serve the kids items first before commencing the first course of our set dinner. Such simple gestures really enhance our dining experience. We hope to return soon

Approached the restaurant with some trepidation after the bad experience in previous branches (suspect weights and quality of seafood). First time here, and as a guest, so went with an open mind.First impressions - Car park spot is mighty difficult to get. Once parked, there is a bit of a hike up to the restaurant - it sits on elevated ground so if you park in front, the approach is up a long (to an older person, very long...) flight of stairs. If you have difficulty with mobility and don't have a motorised wheelchair, give this place a miss. If you park at the back, it's even further to the stairs. Alternatively you could walk through the very slippery narrow pathway that goes by the kitchen. But I wouldn't risk the fall.Ambience - Much nicer than the other branches, but then, it IS in Dempsey. Just as noisy though.Service - Not for want of trying (by the staff) but because there simply aren't enough wait staff on a busy night. Made worse by the odd shape of the place.Food quality - Above average compared to other branches. Average compared to similar seafood restaurants. There are much better ones, though not in town.Overall - a decent choice if you are looking for a seafood restaurant in town. Otherwise, you'd be better off heading to the more conventional locations (and there are many of them) out of town to get similar quality at lower prices or better quality at similar prices

Our family went to the Dempsey seafood restaurant for the first time, and we were greetd by this lady called Sharon Teng. She served us all the way and even recommeded some great dishes. She made sure our food was served right and according to our preference. I would say the service is impeccable and the food certainly was great. Thank you Sharon for makng our first meal at Jumbo Dempsey wonderful and we definitely will be frequenting
3
Had the black pepper, chillie crabs and cod fish. It was good food, no complains.
Service was fast. It gets crowded so reservations are required. Did not particularly enjoy the home made bean curd dish.
4
Spicy Crabs are the specialty and they were up to the expectation! Slightly expensive but definitely worth the money!
3
Average at best. The service was not great and there is nothing really to recommend this restaurant given that it is a taxi from where ever you are.
4
THe food is standard Jumbo - excellent stuff on offer. the black pepper crab is better than the chilli. i somehow cannot understand why the chilli crab is called chilli crab as it is more sweet than hot. in fact to me there is no trace of heat in the dish at all. however, it does taste good with the buns. there is one dish that is normally not available or gets bought out very very fast. you need to either order before you reach or you need to be very lucky. it is quite expensive also - SGD 11 per piece. it is a strange dish to have in a seafood restaurant. but it is one of the best i have ever had - it is a lamb chop - made from baby lamb - it is just exquisite.you are recommended to have a reservation. otherwise it will be a bit of a wait especially on weekends and in the evening. wehave never got a chance to eat inside - it has always been an outside seat. and this can get hot.the staff are by default welcoming and very professional and helpful. despite all this, i like Jumbo's ECP outlet better as it is bang on the seaside and you have a nice view. if you are lucky you will have a nice breeze and it has almost never rained whenever we have been there - so we sit outside
4
Having eaten at the East cost seafood park few years ago , i approached this trip with some hesitancy. ........ but the visit was absolutely worth it !!. from the crispy garlic chicken starter to the super pepper crab and steamed sea bass in ginger and soy the food was spot on. The ambience is far better than at their seafood park branch and service friendly as well
2
Went here for a late dinner since other restaurants nearby were almost closing (9.15 pm) and selected few appetizers and two crabs (one chili & one butter poached) for the four of us. The chili crab was pretty decent but the butter poached one wasn't and didn't seem as fresh too. The staff didn't care much about our comments...The bill came out almost 400$ with only few drinks, so definitely no value for money here!!
3
You must book for a table a day before even it is a weekday.It is recommended to have an early dinner to avoid over crowded.I think the chili crab in No Sign Board is better - especially their sauce (the quality & quanitity). I like spicy food fyi. But here, it think a little bit cheaper
4
Went for early dinner on Saturday and it was packed. Great and fast service. Every dish was very good and fresh. We had cooked prawns, prawns vietnamese style, chilli crab, broccoli and scallops in ouster sauce, rice. We were stuffed. Courses arrive as they are cooked. Ask for bibs to cover your clothes when eating seafood, most guests have those on as crab and cooked prawns need to be shelled and it certainly gets very messy! It is not a cheap place but good for a special occasion with family and close friend who you don't mind shelling seafood and getting messy with. Wouldn't work for a first date.
4
We heard about Jumbo's from a cab driver during our recent holiday to Singapore. We went to the one on Dempsey Hill though they are quite a few around town. The ambience was great and the chilli crab was fantastic. I was dissapointed by the cocktails though. Watered down and not the right proportions.
4
Very busy, crowded, staff were very good, crab was just amasing. The sweet & sour pork also really good. other seas food brilliant.Its the kind of place you can go with friend grab a beer immediately, mull over the menu, have another beer while you wait for the food, then start drinking again. 2-3 hours goes so quickly in a place like this. Great fun and great food
5
Wow, location is nice, waiters are friendly, the food is so good and tasty. You can spend the whole day eating

"JUMBO SEAFOOD" group has a few outlets in various part of Singapore. Though the main theme is SEAFOOD, but different outlets serves items in different styles (eg. Jumbo Seafood Dempsey serves steamboat as well); and some outlets have their own "SPECIALITY". The location is interesting, as DEMPSEY area is away from the city lights, surrounded by single story buildings amongst greenery .It is best to visit by night for dinner; as then one would experience the best ambience. Both the quality and variety of food is good. The chili and black pepper crabs are worth a try. The prices are in line with 3-4 stars restaurant. Services are also good. BON APPETITE 
3
I would not really recommend the chilli crab for Jumbo Seafood (eventhough Singapore's famous for that dish). The restaurant does not do much justice to the dish itself. Pretty sweet and sour rather than chilli flavour. I would however, recommend their prawns in oats and sambal kangkong,which I thought were better dishes, in terms of the flavour!Be prepare to wait for seats when one arrive, as there is usually a queue at the entrance. This restaurant is a pretty popular spot for families. Price-wise: Prepare to fork out slightly above $100-$150 for like, a meal consisting of 4-5 dishes (depending on what one orders and the prices of the dishes).
4
I can't offer an expert opinion, but I can say that I was very happy with my first chili crab experience at Jumbo on Dempsey Hill. We found it very difficult to get reservations at any of the chili crab restaurants in the city with a few days' notice, so we settled on an early reservation at Dempsey. While this wasn't our first choice, it offered a nice change of pace and a great ambiance. The food and service were excellent. After dinner we enjoyed an ice cream at Ben & Jerry's across the way, and a few drinks at Harry's right next door. All in all, it was a really fun, relaxing night out
4
We went with friends to the Jumbo in Dempsey specifically to try their chilli crab and it was indeed excellent. We arrived without a booking (not advisable) and the place was heaving with locals (always a good sign) we were told a table would be available in about 20 minutes so we went to a bar next door for a beer. Bang on 20 minutes we got a call on our mobile and our table was ready. Enjoyed some excellent food and first rate chilli crab. Came away with some Jumbo crab pinys and spice mix to recreate the experience at home!We had no problem at all with the food quality and the service was just fine. Bill for 4 with wine and beer S$240
4
Instead of going to a busy Jumbo restaurant in the busier areas of Singapore try this branch at Dempsey Hill. It seems other shave had issues but our food was very tasty and the service was good. So give this one a try . However it is still best to book this busy chain
3
I went here with my husband and daughter. Was really looking forward to it based on the reviews. The choice was good. We didn't have the chill crab as so many people did. Instead we had a selection to share so not to waste food with my daughter.Unfortunately I discovered to my horror that they had a range of shark fin dishes. Now I am fully aware that this is eaten in Asia but personally find it morally wrong to eat this due to the way it is obtained and if I had known they sold this I would not have gone. The next time I visit Singapore which will be soon and frequently I will not go to Jumbo's again because of this.Service was ok. It was busy and they seemed rather rushed off their feet
3
Had a large family reunion and I was so utterly disappointed w the service but also the food. Yes, the restaurant was full, but still service good have been better. They didn t fill up the tea cups, second orders came so late and the portions were relatively small. Somehow I felt it was a tourist trap. Location at Dempsy is beautiful, but next time I go to great places at the east coast....I was so disappointed !
4
When in Singapore you can't go without a Singapore Chilli Crab or a Black Pepper Crab and these are two of the dishes this restaurant does really well. If I could I would rate this 3.5 rather than 4/5 as although the food was spot on, the service was poor (water glasses sat empty for an hour and staff had an uncanny ability to not see people waving to them) and the wine very sweet and expensive (we are spoiled in Australia though, I admit that)
5
Great service and attentive. I even have the waiters carrying my bag in and out of the restaurant. The plates were changed very promptly when it is full, and you get the standard bibs with the crab. We have ordered too much initially and was advised that we should probably take one dish off, which I am glad we took her advice.We had a black pepper crab tonight and the crab was well cracked so that the flavour really gets into the flash, and the crab was the best we had so far in this trip and the freshest. The vegetables with samba sauce was very flavoursome, and the hor fun was the best we have tried outside of Hong Kong. It is what stir fried was all about. The only slight disappointment was the elephant-trunk clam where I feel the peppers and onion was a little bit under, and the xo sauce didn't have that depth of flavour and caramelisation you would expect.Overall, very good, and will be trying another Jumbo tomorrow night

I am note a crab fan ... but this large restaurant is a good place for business meal. Service is quick and you have a nice choice of seafood... note glamour at all .. if you look for a romantic place find another place.

It was the 15-day of Chinese New Year, and we had no reservation. But we waited for 15 minutes to be seated. Not bad. The food portion has reduced since the last time I visited this restaurant. On a scale of 1 to 5, 5 being the best, I would rate the quality of food as 2.5. We had a set menu of 4 dishes, but we ended up with ordering 2 more dishes for 4 of us. The service is poor. I understand that there is a labor shortage in Singapore, and it is affecting the food business. There is not enough waiters to serve the customers

Chilli crab is the best i have tasted so far. the seafood rice was also delicious. The service was great - go early and make sure you reserve a seat. Nothing but good things to say about this restaurant. We have taken visitors there time and time again and its always a crowd pleaser.
3
This was one of those places where you cannot say it was really good, and neither it was bad... the chilly crab was quite nice, but the service was rather slow, and when we ordered come more bread for the crab sauce, it took so much time that we had already finished for 20 minutes when it arrived.Then when removing the plates, the employee managed to pour some sauce down the back of one of my friends and the manager didnÂ´t even come to apologise
3
The food was what you would find in an average Chinese seafood restaurant. We tried the pork ribs and two pieces ( large ones) were so hard that we returned it and got refunded for it. ( $7.50) a piece. We were ushered into the air conditioned part of the place and I promptly made a U-turn, as it was filled with incense smoke. How can you eat with that smell in your nostrils?? Ridiculous unless you like to be tormented by incense. Rather pricey but nice ambience at the open air area. Good thing it rained, so things were cool
2
We went back for our usual Black Pepper and Chilli Crab dinner, with Kalee. We found the service standards have sharply declined and food is just OK but not worth the hassle of getting a seat. Kalee was not available, the ChilliCrab was full of tomatoes and far too sweet in taste, the black pepper crab was excellent. Our waiter tried hard but simply had too many tables to serve. We had to ask several times for the wine to be opened, to bring the apron, to bring new plates. Fingerbowls were only provided after we asked and the same applied to the tools to open the crab. We were seated in the part facing the parking, a long corridor with no atmosphere at all.We shall not return and look for another restaurant serving crab
4
2nd time within 2 years and service and food are quite the same. Food is a bit better, though. Crab, rice and noodles were excellent, however no crab eating gear were provided, soya sauce was poured into small plate instead of small bottle giving, food was served in some strange sequence, ordered water was forgotten, etc. However food was great and presumably on the higher side price-wise (200 SGD for 4, no drinks)Next time have to try something else at Dempsey Hil

I'm a local Singaporean and we live to eat! My friends came over to visit and we thought we must acquaint them with our local delights and one of our national dishes, the Chilli Crab... There are a few local restaurants where you can get good Chilli crabs and Jumbo is one where you can get one of our best Chilli crabs... They also serve chicken satay (bbq meat on lil bamboo skewers) which is also not too bad. Seafood is fresh here and they are quite honest about what is in stock. I was asked to try other dishes when I wanted to order stir-fried broccoli with scallops and they told me the scallops they had that night were not very good. I appreciate the honesty as these folks are not those who are in for a quick buck. So no worries about being fleeced. We liked the chilli crabs, chicken satay, black pepper beef, boiled live prawns, and the mango and duck salad! Service is efficient and friendly while the food is good as always
3
All our friends said: " Go to Jumbo Seafood, it does the best chilli crab" so we did. I can't understand what the fuss is all about though. The food was nice ( not great, nice), the service was friendly and the beer was cold but it left us feeling a bit- meh. We ordered a set menu and dishes were missed so we had to remind staff that they hadn't arrived. The main reason we went was for the crab and we felt that ( for 4 people) the serving was rather small and really no better than you can get for half the price in China Town with a lot better atmosphere. That is certainly what we will do in future
4
Great place to eat, lucky enough to have a friend who knows when to book. Somewhat crowded and delivery of the food a little slow in their peak hours, but overall good enough to be worth the occasional wait.As with most places in Singapore not cheap
4
it seems to be a very busy place and we arrived with no reservation but they found a place for 2. We got spoicy crab meet with a special body protection to save our shirt. Good fun !
5
This place was just unbelievable. The servings are enormous - a small entree fed three of us. We had a few different kinds of prawns and they were all simply delicious! Cant wait to go back!
4
Great chili crab & black pepper crab. Whatever I read about it, was all true. The service was also good, very efficient and friendly. I did a group dinner here for about 100 people and everyone enjoyed it.

My husband and i usually enjoy the "hole in the wall" type of restaurants, but we decided to try Jumbo on Dempsey since we had clients in town as well....i must say the crabs are quite big, but as far as the seasoning and how they prepared it...not so much! We called ahead for reservations for 8 people and also ordered our food ahead of time to avoid wait time since we were with important clients. We waited 40 minutes for the waiter to tell us that some of the items we ordered were sold out! Well, they couldve told me this when we were seated, but they waited 40 minutes to let us know, after complaining to the manager, the sold out clams suddenly surfaced out of nowhere!!! To be quite honest, although the crabs are really big, the seasoning is poor, the inside of the crabs were really dry as they were steamed for too long and it was just disappointing! next day we ventured to Eng Seng and had a much better experience there for a quarter of the price!!! Forget the big chains and head to where the locals eat chili crab (cheaper and authentic!!!)...just ask any taxi driver where he eats chili crabs!!! :
4
Tucked in a "village of restaurants" set off the main roads, Jumbo@Dempsey IS quite large. The place was quite full (generally a good sign); service was fine; my friend's dish, a sweet & sour seafood was okay but not special....But my dish -- Prawns fried in cereal -- was outstanding: piquant and with a tiny kick. I ate every speck and washed it all down happily with a large Tiger beer. Try it....you'll be happy you did

Just this Monday, I'd gone to Jumbo Seafood @ Dempsey to celebrate my dad's birthday. We'd ordered the scallops with yam paste, seafood you tiao, fried mee sua, chilli crabs and man tou, grilled prawns, garlic fried chicken and a stir-fried vegetable.The deep-fried scallops with yam paste were delivered to our table in less than 10 minutes after we'd ordered, drenched in oil, and the scallops were cold. It was a disappointing start to the meal. The seafood youtiao that came with it was acceptable - warm, and not as oily, but it was not stellar either. Grilled prawns were delivered portioned out on an individual plate, but it was extremely salty and peppery - masking any taste of the prawns. Just as disappointing as the scallops. At least they were fresh enough to not adhere to the shells, I guess.The garlic fried chicken was like a traditional roast chicken, but much more salty, even if you could taste the fragrance of the garlic. My mum complained that it wasn't a full chicken (no drumsticks were found), and unfortunately, they charged us for the entire chicken. The chilli crabs were only ok, and I've had much better ones. Like all the other fried food on the table, the fried mantous delivered were oily, and didn't have the smoothness that was expected. It still went pretty ok with the chilli crabs, so there's a (sort-of) redeeming point.The fried mee sua was pretty much the only redeeming feature of the meal that night, but I just can't find it in me to extol it's tastes. It was... normal. The free mango sago they gave us as a goodwill gesture was good - creamy and the taste of mango was prominent. That was probably it.Good service? No. I had to ask three times for a glass of ice water, and a change of plates.Good food? No. It was cheap - $42 per person, but for the taste... Terrible.Will I go back again? No. East Coast Park has a better selection, and even other Jumbo restaurants tasted much better. I sometimes wonder if it's because we went late - 8pm, but I saw a couple being seated just as we left, so I doubt that was the reason for this lack luster performance. Sorry, but no.No love,Me
3
Went here with a large group of about 15. Service was good, I found the food to be just so-so. It seemed to lack a bit of freshness, as if it had been sitting on the line for too long. We had a bit of everything, and I didn't LOVE anything. The pepper and chili crab of course, is a highlight of Singapore. Most of us at the table found the peppered crab to be much more delicious than the chili crab. The chili crab seemed overly sweet. The place was packed, so it seems to have a great reputation, but the laksa that I bought at the food market was much more tasty than the food I had here at Jumbo. As far as choosing the exact fish / crustacean (as in from the tank) that I want to eat for dinner- that doesn't really hold a lot of appeal for me. In fact, I find it rather unappetizing.
5
Visited Jumbo's and all I can say is we cant wait to go back. Would hop on a flight just for a meal and return we were that impressed. The pepper crab is simply the best, out of this world and the tastiest crab I've ever had especially for those who like a spicier dish. The chilli crab was also great and not as spicy. The other accompanying dishes like the salted fish fried rice was really nice. Service was great considering the number of patrons. Very reasonably priced as well for a seafood restaurant. Have actually booked a 2 day visit to Singapore for my husband's birthday mainly for the crab when we are in Asia next year!!

My parents, husband and I recently had the pleasure of dining at Jumbo@Dempsey for dinner, which was my favorite meal during my recent two-week Singapore trip. My parents had gone to Jumbo@Dempsey a few months prior and were unimpressed with lackluster service; however, the service we experienced this night was quick and attentive. Unsurprisingly, the chili crab and mantou stole the show and were easily the favorite items of the night! Bibs, finger bowls, and wet towels were greatly appreciated.We also ate cereal prawns (a must-have – very delicious compared to many other restaurants on the island), baby squids, sambal kang kong, coffee ribs, and deep fried fish with soy sauce (“yau cham”). We were pleasantly surprised at how quick each of the dishes came. For full disclosure, we ate here on a Tuesday at 6:00pm, which likely worked in our favor. However, the restaurant was surprisingly packed even at 6:00pm! We asked the waiter and he said that they are busy all week, weekdays included, and even during lunch. My advice to interested diners would be to come here on the earlier side for lunch/dinner to experience quicker, more attentive service. And take a moment to walk around the shops/restaurants at Dempsey when you are done – it is a very scenic experience

We enjoyed the place and food at Jumbo. The crabs are fresh and tasty. The vegetable menu are cooked well and delicious. The restaurant is cozy and good for being with friends/ family. Love the food, love the location which is a bit on the hill. Service is fair
5
We tried the chilli crab and black peper crab. chilli crab was fantastic. Not very spicy also
4
dempsey is a bit far off the tourist beat, but it's become a niche food location. and jumbo seafood maintains a reasonable standard in all its branches.
5
I just had dinner at this restaurant with my friends. The shrimp and crab are simply heavenly!! The rib cooked with coffee bean is another special treat which I ate for the first time. A wonderful dining experience.
4
Really good seafood to be had here, reminiscent of the fab seafood along the East Coast without having to drive all the way there.Gets crowded most nights especially on weekends, so reservations advised. Popular spot with locals as well as visitors.Much prefer this spot compared to Clarke Quay.
4
Dempsey is one of the places you have to visit when out in Singapore. Nice selection of boutique style restaurants of which the Jumbo is one. You can still eat outside here in most places and that on itself is kind of unique. Staff needs a little training understanding English, some of our drink orders were not immediately taken. Food is just great, but it is a busy place, so if you are heading there with a big party, make sure you make reservations
4
Well, there are not many places where you can entertain your guests in singapore. this is like one of the favourites places where they serve the signature chilli crab, pepper crab. I must say they are reasonably good for singapore standard. This is also THE PLACE for entertaining guests because their chain of restaurants are more "presentable" as compared to other restaurants in singapore serving chilli crab. Well, but the menu is so limited that most can memorize what they have to offer. The demsey outlet appeared to be nicer than other outlets but they are mostly alfresco tables, they have few indoor seatings. Make sure you make reservations in advance as they are always packed during dinner time.You get some discount if you sign up as a Jumbo member
5
one of the best chilli crabs ever, at really low price, very nice ambience(al fresco sitting), quick and friendly service and lots of people (locals mostly or those in the know).ask for the special towels (really funny, they picture a cartoon crab) that hang on the neck.the village is very nice for a walk, with art galleries. also read the history of Dempsey, very interesting
4
I have eaten at Jumbo in many locations, but Dempsey is my favourite. Dempsey is a lovely area with exclusive eateries and delis, in a quiet area of Singapore away from all the tall buildings.Jumbo has amazing food, with wonderful Chilli Crab (about SG$55), don't forget the steamed buns to soak up the sauce! We also like the Cereal Prawns (about SG$25 for a medium size dish) and the Black Bean Steamed Sea Bass (about $35-$55 depending on size of fish).What makes this fantastic value is the BYO policy on wine, you can take two bottles with no corkage charge. With wine being so expensive in Singapore this makes it a total winner!Only slight let down is the service, but you have just to be a bit bold to get attention of a waiter and make sure they bring what you asked! Not enough of a let down to stop a great review of the place though, well worth it

My family has been a "Jumbo frequent diner" for a number of years. We have enjoyed their Jumbo discounts, we are in possession of the Jumbo VIP card, and we have had numerous family gatherings at Jumbo (Dempsey) over recent years. Our collective opinion is simply: every meal we have had went downhill from our first visit. Of course we tried to be fair and factored in the "bad night" scenario but after tonight's experience, we will take our seafood taste buds to Long Beach. Reason: we had an 8pm reservation and we were seated promptly, great! We ordered immediately, being frequent diners, we had no need to look at the menu. Super. Our drinks order didn't get to our table till 8:15pm, and it was only a beer and a glass of white wine. And no, the restaurant wasn't busy at all on this Sunday night (must be the economy). No food arrived at our table till 8:30pm when the fried rice came. Where's the crab and expensive Soon Hock fish? In any case, we waited till 8:45pm when we asked for the manager who admitted errors in the kitchen and comped us the rice and drinks. Our evening was completely destroyed. It was our anniversary. We managed to salvage the remainder of the evening by popping down to Long Beach where our seafood cravings were immediately fulfilled. Jumbo has gone way too upmarket and will soon price itself out of everybody's budget. Why dine there with poor service and high prices when there are so many other seafood options available. I'm dumping my Jumbo VIP card
4
The food and restaurant were good. I had no regrets choosing this restaurant. I would have to give a higher priority to Long Island and No Signboard based on number of selections and atmosphere. Jumbo Seafood is a good third choice. The one by Clarke Quay had nicer outdoor seating than Dempsey
5
Excellent service (personable yet professional), unusual location (an old set of army barracks) and very good tangy, chilli crab.
Try it!
4
We dug in and we were happy! The chili crab was delicious, the wait staff attentive and friendly and the restaurant is not pretentious. Pricey. Worth it. Worth it.
1
Reservation lost. Arrogant servers... And worst I could not understand some servers' English. Food is over rated. Over priced. Over hype.
4
chilli crab is good, service is a bit brusk, sit outside not in, expensive
5
There are many many good restaurants serving excellent black pepper or chilli crab or the freshest seafood. Why Jumbo at Dempsey is different because not only they live up to excellent grub promise but the service is efficient, you don't have to wait for a minute for your tiger beer and they don't rush you through your meal even there is a long queue at reception. You will meet local affluent singaporeans who love their seafood cooked (or uncooked) to excellence and then take a walk along the many specialty grocers, art shops, carpet and boutiques at this gem of a village
4
Before we even got to Singapore, anyone we spoke to recommended that we go to Jumbo Seafood. Our expectations were really high and we were not disappointed at all. The food here was fantastic, great ambiance as well. We would love to go back there to try the black pepper crab and perhaps indulge in some chilli crab too!Make sure you have a reservation otherwise it can be a long wait, we were lucky someone didn't show up.The service is good, but can be a little slow because of the number of customers dining there.The location at Dempsey was grea
4
I loved the pepper crab which was spicy and fresh. The other dish I liked was Pork ribs in Mocha which was a first time for me. Dempsey is in itself a good area to explore as there are loads of international restaurants serving authentic stuff. It would be advisable to book a table in advance otherwise you might be dissapointed to be turned away

Let me say upfront ..I am a long-term expat in Singapore, and during my 2o+ years in Singapore I have been to Jumbo Seafood at the East Coast numerous times every year ..and never once had any slightest reason to complain. However ..our dinner at the Jumbo@Dempsey Hill ...was a waste of time and money. The mainland Chinese staff were unable to take a simple order for several dishes. Repeated attempts to get it right - still got it wrong. For example ..an order for one portion of fried rice became 2 portions of steamed rice. Ordering jugs of beer ..got it wrong or never arrived.. As the dinner plates were smaller than usual ..to get them changed to have a little space for the next dish ...was a struggle ..so we changed them ourselves. To top it all ..their signature dish (chilli crab) was so diluted in taste ...we thought we are in the wrong restaurant. Maybe Chinese-speaking customers have it easier ..but sorry folks, ..we are not in mainland China ..this is Singapore ..and I can rightfully expect that a food order can be given in English ..or maybe you should have a sign at the door - only Chinese-speaking expats allowed. But then ..their business is so good ..why should they care ...The saving grace for this otherwise disappointing evening were the Tiger Beer lady (local) and one other local service staff. The rest were a bunch of mismanaged amateurs from China who had no idea what they were doing, or simply couldn't give a damn

Have been to Longbeach a few times and friends mentioned we should try Jumbo's opposite Ben and Jerry's at DempseyMy friends had been before and seemed to rate it. We had starters and mains, the starters were average (we had steak strips, deep fried fresh baby squid (my friend said it could just as easily be fried cockroach) and Pak Choi (I think that was the green dish!) , boring but average it’s the main courses and the service that was truly appallingSo we ordered drinks - half the table got and half didn't - after repeated attempts at getting all our drinks we finally received them mid way through the main course. The problem is if you don't order from your main server and we didn't, then you clearly risk not getting your drinks at all.We ordered some red wine - the bottle came and was placed on the table - 15 minutes later we mentioned if we had to bring our wine bottle opener, quite sarcastically (lost on what seemed a recently arrived to the country waiter with little/no experience of why he was there or what he should be doing). After finally getting the wine bottle opened the waiter then tried to pour the wine for a taste but he didn’t know what he was doing and partly missed the glass – fortunately I had my hands underneath so red wine went onto my hands and not onto my jeans.For mains we had Chili Crab, Pebber Crab and Mee Goreng. Chili Crab was cold and as such I didn’t feel like eating much of it. Pebber Crab was more pepper flavor than crab and tasted truly disgusting so couldn’t really eat that either. The Mee Goreng was nice (it came towards the end of our main course of crab) so myself/the wife ate mostly that (the next day we had the worst headaches and other issues so clearly there was an issue with some of the food we had eaten – I suspect MSG but of course we don’t know this)Our friends did say that the service and food was not what they normally experienced. For what is relatively expensive it was unacceptable (but poor food and service is quite common on Dempsey – be warned!)It came to pay the bill and our friends said they had a card to get a discount – but they couldn’t find the card so that was that, no discount (my friend said but we can give you our address cant you check it on the system.. it was all a bit pointless)We will never come back again, and neither will our friends. Please don’t waste your time with this place – it is awful, go to Long Beach instead its far, far better and whilst the service is questionable (we’ve been 3 times in the last 3 months and it is variable) the food is so much better and always of a consistently high quality than this plac

I went there with a friend and we ordered plenty of food. We ordered baby cabbage, spinach tofu which was excellent, stir fried noodles, grilled giant tiger prawns and as the highlight of the night 2 kilo of black pepper crab. The food was just amazing, would always recommend to go there again. The crab was a little pricey but worth every cent.Good hint - this is a BYO restaurant. Just across the street is a nice wine shop were you get your wine
3
Too busy, so attention to service suffers. I'd avoid it like the plague on weekends. Watch out for the dripping air-conditioning vents.
3
We had a problem with this place, They took an hour to serve rice, However after complaining the manager dealt with the problem very quickly (Well done)
5
Top quality, great seafood and that's all that counts.
4
This was a great venue for a family banquet. Relaxed atmosphere and quality seafood in voluminous quantities. We had the chilling crab and pepper crab and both were delicious. I
left wanting to return again soon.

My understanding is that there are many better crab restaurant alternatives in Singapore.Overall our food and dining experience here was excellent. We had a mediun Chilli Crab and XO Stir Fried Asparagus and they were both deliciousWhen we got our bill we were surprised that we were charged for a 1.4Kg Crab or about $64 when we believed it could not have been any more than 0.9kg at most. On questioning the manager he reduced it to 1.2kg but we said that was still too much. In the end we paid for 0.95kg and also ended up paying $1.50 for peanuts we did not touch.Its very easy to be overcharged when you order crab. Most tourists would never question the bill but we did. If the restaurant honestly believed we had a 1.4kg crab then we feel confident they would not have budged on the bill. Be aware
4
A little hard to get to, but well worth the trip. It's one of our more favourite restaurants in Singapore for seafood.We love the Chilli Crabs, Boiled Live Prawns, Unfortunately, the service can sometimes be poor with what appears to be foreign workers not understanding what's being ordered. Golden Phoenix Chicken and the Shashimi Geoduck!! Most recommended.Bookings are a must
4
Chilli Crabs had been demanded a week before we landed in singapore. We were on a business trip but had planned to pack in as much as we could in 3 days and the Chilli Crab at Jumbo seafood was at the top of that list.Dempsey Hill is a really good place for an evening, food, bars, galleries, there is a whole lot to do but food is at centre stage!The Jumbo Seafood restaurant is a good place to visit. The food is simply amazing. Try the chilli crab, the beef and the fried rice with dry fish. The last dish is just outstanding. I am not fond of dry fish but this dish is truly a MUST HAVE.The service is ok, the waiting staff are very busy so there are occasional slip ups. The food is outstanding. Go for it. Jumbo,seafood gives you jumbo delight
4
Probably the quitest area in Singapore, Dempsey Hill is a revamped army barracks compound featuring now a range of restaurants and bars ranging from local to Asian to Western cuisine and taste. It is secluded from the buzz of the city surrounded by lush greenery and is the perfect place for a relaxed dinner. Jumbo Seafood is part of the popular Singaporean chain of restaurants offering a never-ending menu list of local and international seafood dishes. They are all well-cooked and tasty. Try the chilli crab... just yummy. However, prices are a little on the expensive side.As the place is getting very busy in the evenings it is recommended to reserve a table to avoid long waiting times. Parking is available right in front of the restaurant.Service and staff are very friendly, fast and efficient
4
You are going to love it. The chili crab with "Deep fried Man Tau". Dip the Man Tau into the sauce, you are like living in the dream. For more exciting choice, don't miss the Pepper crab. It's just HOT and delicious. The deep fried prawn is the signature dish of Jumbo as well. Looking for post dinner drink, many good bar locate on Dempsey as well
4
My first visit to Jumbo ECR was back in 1989 and ever since have made it a point to visit it for the Pepper crabs. Was staying a Clarke Quay this September and saw an outlet there as well. Told my Singaporean friend that we must go there for a meal; but he retorted that Jumbo - Yes but at CQ No. He instead took me to the Dempsey outlet. Must say that the atmosphere over here is much better and calmer. Sitting inside or outside the converted barracks is so much nicer specially since the area is so green. Now for the main reason to go there - the food. The cereal coated prawns are a must have; the bamboo mussels a novelty but the winner always is the Pepper Crab. Try the venison as well. Portion sizes are quite rich so if you are in a group of 3 or 4 the select the small and medium options but do order a variety as everything is just great. Average per cover without drinks would be around SD 25/- to 30/- .It's on my must do list for Singapore and visiting it once will addict you to this place as well. By the way - I did go and have a meal at the CQ outlet as well - just as good in terms of food quality but the Dempsey one scores on atmosphere
