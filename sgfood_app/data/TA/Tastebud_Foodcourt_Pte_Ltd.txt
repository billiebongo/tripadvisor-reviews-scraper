The location on the corner of Bugis Street. Began to open around 11 noon until evening. We ate Chicken Penyet and kwetiau. The standard price of about 4-6 dollars and sense passable

We dined here 3 times and each time the food was brilliant. It is a food court with friendly and fast service and huge menu choices from several individual vendors. Most dishes are priced between $6-$8S. Highly recommended

Sukhothai does a really good pad thai. The place was clean, cheap and full of people grabbing a quick meal.

Good food, really good food. Sure there are plenty of quality restaurants in Singapore but there is nothing better than being in amongst the locals eating good fresh tasty food. Here you can choose Chinese, Singaporean, Vietnamese or Thai food at fair prices and it is served quickly with no frills. We ate here several times and loved it each time

We went here twice during our short stay because the food was really tasty and authentic and the environment was much cleaner and organized than the nearby Albert Center food court.We tried two different establishments and the pineapple fried rice and pork with basil were the best dishes we had here

This place is just across Bugis+, bright and cheery little place. Choose a seat away from the TVs if you don't want noise blasting over you. This place is popular with both locals, expats & tourists as it's affordable and good. Wide variety of mainly Asian cuisine (Chinese, Thai, Korean) although I'm sure even the most finicky person could find something to eat here. We tried the cutely named Chicken Up Little-kimchi fries and popcorn soya chicken (5 pieces). You can get a set too but the portions are generous for the fries. I think the kimchi could be more prominent as the fries were drenched in mayo and some shredded chicken.We also shared a plate of fried glass noodle from Sukhothai, which was cooked to perfection. Food came up to about $15 each. Only thing is just skip the drinks stall, the surly man looked as if he was doing me a favour selling me over priced iced lemon tea, after making me wait a good one minute for him to stop staring at his phone. You can prob get better service from the beer lady promoter but I'll take my drinks from the hawker centre just located opposite in future

More of a street kind dining place rather than a food court. Located next to the markets. We enjoyed a variety of dishes from a few of the stalls. Most enjoyable was probably the beef rendang. Prices are quite cheap but portions are not on the big side either
