I did home delivery, and the food was fresh and delicious.
Duck entre, Sweet n sour pork, and chicken fried rice. All very good, no additional seasoning needed. The portion sizes were large too, so good value.
Recommended!

Went a couple of times with friends who live nearby. The food was tasty and the service friendly. You'll have to pay for your drinks with cash separately (they come from the cafe next door).

Great food, very reasonable cost, friendly staff. Good portion sizes. Try the Black Pepper Chili Chop Noodles and the Chicken Fried rice. Excellent value for money.

The restaurant is divided into 2 areas. One, an aircon area for zhichar. And another with "economical rice" (choose your own food), drinks station and noodles shop. There is outdoors seating at the passageway and no, the prices are not cheaper if you sit there.Single dish items like the beef fried rice at SGD6.8 but I did see an item for SGD5. My coffee was SGD1.2. All was good. The beef was tender and tasty, the eggs in the rice was fluffy and the rice was not too oily. Coffee was good too.Decor was nice. And the service was attentive and very polite. Yes, you need to pay for every item as it comes to your table but you can order it all at once.I did not patronize the economical rice store but I understand from someone who eats there often that it is cheaper.Yes, I would go there again. Note, there is another zhichar place next door and a coffee shop selling noodles, bak kut teh and econmical rice 2 doors down, so competition is stiff

We had two recent dinners at Guan Kitchen and found their food to be tasty and affordable. The Authentic Style Sea-bass in Garlic Spicy Sauce (deep fried whole fish) is especially good. Prices are similar to kopitiam (coffee shop) levels, but Guan Kitchen is styled like a restaurant with air-conditioning. The deep-fried whole fish is over S$20 (below S$30). Even fresh fruit juices are at S$3.50. Overall a good experience

We found this restaurant while out walking from Clarke Quay. The staff were very halpful, especially Summer. Our dinner of vegetarian fried rice, shredded beef strips with pepper and lemongrass pork ribs was delicious and spicy. The decor is simple but interesting. One wall has a display of decorated masks. We sat on small wooden stools which were actually quite comfortable. We plan to eat here again before we leave Singapore. Their prices are much more reasonable than the restaurants in Clarke Quay.

I am bewildered by the reviews I read about this place. I have only recently visited this establishment for lunch and it must have gone under new management/owners because the experience we had was a lot different from the better reviews I read.To put this in better perspective, the establishment is split into three different shop spaces which makes people think they are three different eateries. The first shop space serves porridge and dishes. We had lunch here once late last year. The flavor and quality was acceptable but average. Definitely more pricey than other better places which serve similar food. The second shop space hosts four food vendor stalls. The very first stall serves rice and dishes, the second serves fruit juices, the third serves chicken rice (if my memory serves me right) and the last stall serves kway chap (flat white rice noodle and braised pork dishes). The third shop space serves tze char dishes. This is something we have not tried (thank goodness).We decided to give this place a second chance and had lunch at the rice and dishes stall at the second shop space. The dishes were cold and below average in terms of taste. The dishes were in no way authentic in terms of local taste. Price is more than what you will pay at most hawker centers.Looks like it is wiser to travel a little further for better food choices. For folks who live in the vicinity, you may be happy to note there are much better food at the following places (short distance away):1. Liang Court (mostly Japanese food, McDonald's and Starbucks)2. Killiney Road3. Great World City4. Zion Road Hawker CentreI would not recommend this establishment to my friends or family

I have been eating in this restaurant since 2014, over the years the place has changed from a cheap looking plastic furniture restaurant to a more classy and cozy restaurant. although prices increased a bit over the years it is still cheap with good tasting food

A polite enquiry with our Hotel reception for directions to a local hawker hut for a cheap meal featuring local cuisine saw us walk over to River Valley Rd where we came across Guan Kitchen.Decor isnt five star but is clean, service is lightning quick, drinks are cold...and the food is WONDERFUL!Kids enjoyed beef rice & seafood rice whilst we chomped down on Singapore noodles.S $10 for cokes & beer whilst dinner was a whopping S $28 for ALL of us.Menu is huge and a wide variety of individual dishes are available rather than just meat & noodle/rice combo's.Great find, great food...definately recommended by us. Enjoy

A very affordable place to have a quick lunch with simple and traditional plates which cost around 6SGD
Funny enough you need to pay each time you order something : meal, drink, dessert

Not one of the fancy restaurants that you will find aside the river. It is a local restaurant and visited by local people. The food is excellent. I selected the chicken with honey and ginger. And some spicy vegetables.

Cheap and cheerful. Relaxed vibe, nothing too fancy. Fast service. Very tasty food. The night we visited they had ginger ribs as a special and they were amazing.

Absolutely beautiful local restaurant. Second night going there. Packed with locals. Very cheap flavoursome food. $10 big plate Thai chicken chop, or lemongrass ribs. Excellent

I live near hear now and really miss being close to a Hawker center. So glad I found this place! It is a bit more expensive and complicated than Hawker fare (6.50 black pepper chicken chop rice...which is outstanding), but the quality is also a lot higher.

Brought my family to Guan Kitchen for dinner last weekend. My favourite dish was the Red Grouper Soup with Pickles. The fish was tender and fresh. Best of all, it is boneless which my nephew loves it. We also ordered the crisp fried fish skin with salted egg yolk. This dish is like a starter and you are likely to get addicted munching it. I would recommend everyone to head there if you want to try something different from the usual zi char dishes

This restaurant is located along River Valley Road and it’s located along the row of shophouses near the junction with Mohamed Sultan Road.They offer Zi Char, but with a East-meets-West twist. The restaurant has a main air-conditioned area with some seats at the outdoor alfresco area. Here are the items we had:- Lemongrass Pork Ribs: $22. Rating: ***. This was very good. Love the shredded lemongrass cooked together with the beautifully flavored pork ribs.- Homemade Preserved Radish Beancurd: $13.80. Rating: **. The beancurd was soft and silky. The preserved radish or Caipoh was fried till crispy and placed atop the tofu. Really nice.- Deep Fried Pork with Fermented Bean Paste: $15. Rating: *. The pork was fragrant and juicy. The fermented beancurd gives the pork a briny taste and the garlic fried with this dish were what kept me coming back to this dish.- Crisp-fried Fish Skin with Salted Egg Yolk: $15. Rating: *. Fried fish skin, coated with salted egg yolk. What’s not to like with this dish?- Sauteed Lotus Root with Macadamia: $15. Sliced lotus root sautéed with peapods, carrots and celery. A simple dish of vegetables.- Chicken Soup with Chinese Yam Ishinabe: $25. This was packed with Chinese herbs, which gave the soup a nice flavour. The Chinese yam broke up easily, but do scoop the bottom of the soup bowl to reach it.- Red Grouper Soup w Pickles: $38.00. This was served in a glass flat pot, with a candle heating the pot from below. The fish Was cut into manageable pieces, so you can scoop into your bowl and eat. Fish were fresh.- Rib-eye Beef w Leeks in Ishinabe: $28.00. The beef were sliced thin and cooked with black pepper in a stone pot.Do ask for the belachan, which is home-made and it is good and spicy.To quench my thirst, I had warm barley drink, which is definitely home-made and not from a commercial source

Definitely not the best eating place in Singapire but at the prices and portion sizes you can't really go wrong. While I can't rave about the food, I can say it was worth eating there. At $58 for two of us eating more than we could handle it was definitely value for money. The lemongrass ribs were probably the best while the Thai style sotong (squid) was mediocre. The BBQ prawn was overcooked although nicely flavoured. All in all no complaints considering the price

If you're looking for a more authentic singapore food place, then i recommend you try this. You'll get a lot of food, and it's cheap and good. Service is fast and it's a great place for having a good lunch if you're not too concerned about traffic noise.I like coming back here cause its convenient, fast and good quality

Just around the corner from our hotel we had looked at a few restaurants before picking here. A good selection (even vegetarian for me) and a friendly atmosphere. Locals happy to chat and have a laugh as we tried a number of different items. If staying at the Robertson Quay hotel area this is right on your doorstep, and a great place to try some food with a more local flavour
