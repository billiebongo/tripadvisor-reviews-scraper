Decided to give this a try and enjoyed the home cooked dishes. Pictures tell you more so, included what we ordered. Spices and taste were as we expected. We’ll be back to try more next time.

It was my second visit to this restaurant. Felt that it was pretty yummy overall, but definitely way overpriced.
Especially for the Ayam Goreng - It was like $28 for a plate of diced fried chicken. Not very impressed with the taste either.

Our first trip to Singapore and there’s not enough time to try all the awesome food places! After Having lunch at Maxwell food center, we walked along Tanjong Pagar across the street with numerous fun restaurants- “nightlife” for a change and Cumi Bali fit the bill. The owner\chef “Fiona” is wonderful and gave us a chicken satay on the House - delicious, tender and juicy. Way better than anything at the stalls! We also had perfectly cooked eggplant, signature dish Cumi Bali (squid) which was a good size for 3, beef Rendang and Ikan Baker a mild fish with 16 spice covering. The fish had large bones and not a lot of meat which was good for us.Lastly the Chendool was fantastic and refreshing after a long day and ordered two! Be a food lover and try new things! We’ll be back on our next visit

Great Indonesian restaurant that has everything from sayor lodeh to ikan bakar. Authentic decor and very realistic depiction of an Indonesian restaurant especially if you ask to be seated upstairs. The owner is still hands on with the quality of the restaurant although it is clear she is running it as a business rather than for the love of cooking. The restaurant moved from a non-airconditoned location a stone’s throw away, which tells you it has bee growing successfully over the years

We had a cocktail at the Tipple Wine & Whisky Bar on Tanjong Pagar Rd but couldn’t obtain a dinner booking, so we were eager to have some food.I’m not too sure why we settled on this place just it was on the way back to our apartment, it was rainy and we were hungry.We had two beers, shared an entrée and had two mains with steamed rice. The food was OK but not great and certainly not the best Balinese/Indonesian food we have had. From memory the bill was about S$80. We would not go back

If you don't want to waste your precious time here, please AVOID. We visited this restaurant for Saturday lunch, a simple two dishes took 50mins to come. WITHOUT proper apologies and explanation.I mean if you were busy, should have notified customers when they made their orders instead of letting them hanging around. TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!! The food was average - definitely not worth wasting you time waiting here
4
We had dinner there on a monday night with my inlaws. The owner is very nice and helpful. We had eggplants, potato balls, satay, veggie curry, tofu tempeh - all delicious. But it's quite pricey : plate of eggplants :18$, plate of tempeh :18$, 1 satay : 9$
2
We came to this restaurant with a craving for tauhu telur. Major disappointment. Call a spade a spade. This is tauhu telur. In the menu it's stated as a special omelette. In fact, I couldn't even find a single morsel of tauhu inside even with the owner prying. And it's still called tauhu telur. This is just a regular omelette with at least 5 eggs and some pieces of red and green bell peppers that costs $12. I can easily do this simple omelette at home. A small plate of veg can set u back for $18. Don't waste your calories and money in this restaurant when you can do it at home easily yourself
4
Very friendly welcome and recommendations that fitted exactly with what I had planned to order: Sate Madura (large pieces of juicy chicken thigh with Kecap Manis), Kambing Rendang, Kang Kong and rice, with a couple of Bintangs. The price is reasonable for Singapore (i.e. much more expensive than in Indonesia, but not extortionate) and the atmosphere is friendly
3
went there for dinner, was shock when i reached, there's only 1 guest inside. so i went in and i ordered satay, tauhu telur. to my surprise, the satay was the first one to serve and it was quite a big stick. the tauhu telur came out like a omelette and the tauhu was bought in the supermarket, those that was in the round shape
4
On the main road in Tanjong Pagar, it's not difficult to find.
Large dining area on 2nd level.
Great tasting food but we asked for the non-spicy versions as we had small kids.
Would come again to taste more dishes.
Service was good.
4
We had a great dinner, sharing the backed fish & the 18 spices, ikan bakar, with vegetables (a delicious spinach and onion combination);We has a very friendly host, very keen, making sure that we had an enjoyable Indonesian food experience. Our dish was even photographed for the local paper... watch out for my hand in the picture! We finished with the chendol dessert, a great exotic sweet experience..
5
We've had a very relaxed business dinner at the Cumi Bali which is definitely different to the polished restaurants in the CBD area. Very small, very authentic and lovely. The beer is served from a can, a plastic cover over the tablecloth, you chose your dishes by photos. It immediately reminded my of my last trip to Bali. The style and the smell of that place let's you think of Indonesia. And taste of the food was absolutely delicious, they prepare their dishes over a charcoal grill and use a lot of Indonesian spices. Start a small conversation with the owner - she's very friendly. Prices are reasonable for Singapore. I can only recommend that place.
2
Saw an article on newspaper about this restaurant's food. Decided to give it a try. Ordered 8 dishes for 13- pax for lunch. Food taste OK, but we were shocked to see the receipt. It's overpriced! There are lots of restaurant around the area that worth to explore compared to this one. Will not return again
4
Overall foods is nice but not for real Indonesian since the food more to 'fusion' style.Pretty authentic & good taste = Es Cendol & Satay (I think you must tries this) - the other foods I tried was the Rendang & Squid which is normal
1
Visited this place today....Total bill for 4 pax were $110. Ordered 4 plates of rice (serving size was smaller than a cup A bra size), beef rendang (taste liked mutton and rest owner was bragging abt the spices she used for rendang...super sweet cum tasteless), sayur lodeh (sweet..eating all her food can promote diabetics), signature Satay Madura (Signature for uncooked tasteless satay..) and best...Signature Ikan Bakar (tasteless & fishy steam leather jacket fish. Wait is bakar defined as grilled or steam). Best part when asked...restaurant owner, Fiona claimed she saw the chef soaked the fish in water...isnt soaking fish is not the proper way to defrost. We work so hard everyday to treat oursleves to a good deserving meal... but not to get ripped off with a lousy meal with an expensive bill, loust meal n dishonesty. Verdict -5 / 5 bowls...eAt curry chicken at funeral wake is even million times nicer....well done Cumi Indonesia Restaurant..u gained we lost...
1
We ordered the rice, the sayur lodeh tasted so sweet, chicken satay not quite cook through, beef rendang was totally flop and lastly the ikan bakar which supposed to be their signature dish did not turn out to bakar (grilled) but KUKUS= steamed! A misrepresentation on this! When we asked the owner why does the Fish doesn't quite taste right, Fiona she told us that the fished was soaked into the water as part of food preparation. Totally doubtful on the food hygiene here. There were mosquitoes and made us uncomfortable throughout the dinner. I don't think it's worth our money about $110 and we won't be bothered to return again especially she rant about the food cost of her precious Sambal Belachan. Worst service from her.
5
A very authentic Bali Indonesian cuisine run by the owner Fiona who is passionate in her experience in Balinese cuisine. She was very friendly and full with stories when come to her journey in cooking. Quality ingredients used in ensuring every mouthful is a memorable one. The food is as delightful as in her sharing. P/S: The chendol is a killer desert and an exceed exception experience
5
The best Indonesian restaurant so far. I would highly recommend the Sate Medura (the best bbq so far!!!) vegetable curry, Ikan Bakar, and Cumi Bali (grilled squid - for which the restaurant is named). If you are craving for Indonesian food, this is the place to be. Will definitely visit this restaurant again.
5
I have been to this place so many times and I have never been disappointed by their food. This is a very decent padang place which does not blow a hole in your pocket. I have taken many friends and family here, and I have only gotten praise about how good the food is from them.I will always order, and recommend these three things: Terong Belado (eggplant with chilli paste), Sate Madura (bbq-like chicken) and Tahu Tempe. The service is slightly lacking but the food makes up for it completely. The restaurant is along Tanjong Pagar which has a lot of traffic but somehow remains hidden between the scores of korean restaurants around the area
5
We arrived late at 2.30 p.m., but the owner Fion suggested us some authentic Indonesian dishes and drink. Very delicious taste! A very good cuisine in a friendly ambient. We will come back for sure.

Stopped on Sunday evening by chance , saw the TripAdvisor logo on the door ... the rest was downhill from there. Nasi Goreng tasteless served without crackers or any veggies or sambal. When I ordered the chicken rendang, the chef gestured to the waiter and indeed I should have worried : what was served had nothing to do with rendang!! More like Chinese soaked chicken into MSG sauce!! Awful. Then the bill came , and instead Of the listed price of 12 dollars , I was charged 28!! When I asked an explanation, the price was changed to 18 sgd and was told that the chef had not been trained!! was still charged 0,5 sgd for tap water !! Awful Awful, stay away !!

I liked this friendly Indonesian restaurant a lot. Not so fancy to look at maybe, but the food was excellent. We stuck to their signature ikan bakar (baked fish with a thick coating of spices) and cumi sotong (grilled squid), plus tempe tahu, which was an astonishing dish of tofu and baked onions - coming from London I never knew you could make a humble onion taste like that. The printed menu gave a price range for fish dishes - we asked, and the owner explained it depended on the market price that day, and then she told us the price for the dish. Fair enough, it was all straightforward and open, so not difficult at all. Portions were large, and all the food was very fresh and honestly delicious. I'd go back tomorrow, if it wasn't a twelve hour flight away
5
The food we took had a very good taste; the one I know from Indonesia!We arrived in the afternoon and although the restaurant was closed at that time, Fiona has prepared the meal because it was my last day in Singapore. An excellent service with a smile. Perfec

Ok. I'll just come out and say it....the owner (I believe) doubled all of our main dish orders. I found out after we received our bill. I was shocked but didn't fight back. I should have. We ordered the fried rice, beef rendang, and sate madura. She made the assumption without asking us to give us (2) orders of Sate, (2) orders of fried rice and the rendang was higher than the menu suggested. The price as $12 - 22?? I should've ask but I trusted her to give us (1) portion for each order. So she charged us $18 bucks for the rendang and it looked like a regular portion. Our bill was $64.35 for (3) dishes that was suppose to be light lunch for us. The overall flavor was just so so and the quality not too good. Oh....the rendang was tough and some parts inedible. Avoid this place! The ambiance also is not cool, small, old, and nothing good. I guess the worst part is that I was taken advantage of on my vacation. If you want good Indonesian food....definitely go to Indo Chili! You will not be disappointed! Avoid. You've been warned.

Went with a group of colleagues for a lunch trip and it costs $40 ++ per person. Very expensive for the type and quantity of dishes per person. A tiny plate of kangkong costs $20??? Sayur lodeh in a small bowl also $20? I don't mind these prices if the quantity I got was large but noFor some strange reason they don't have a menu and my guess is that they don't want you knowing the prices beforehand I hate getting ripped off but once bitten twice shy. Go other Indonesia places like Sundanese etc etc and it's more reasonable
4
Cumi Bali is one of my favorite places for lunch. I usually have their seven spices steamed fish with steamed rice. And this time was no different. I tried the cuttlefish too which was very good.And be sure to ask for their chilli, though it's not for the faint-hearted
4
Was walking past and went in on impulse. Had the Cumi Bali (BBQ cuttlefish) and it was a really tasty dish. Fragrant and spicy without a lot of heat to distract from the taste.Finished with the Cendol & would recommend you do yourself the favour of a visit..
1
The grilled fish on the menu and when served is totally different. Grilled fish should be lightly charred on the outside and tender in the inside but instead everything that is served is wrapped up, and it is soggy as if cooked in a stew. The price is outrageous considering the quality of the food. Extremely disappointing
5
A nice, family-run Balinese restaurant on Tanjong Pagar, near the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. Got last-minute reservations for 2 by calling. Very small space, very good food. The satay mandara is really tasty, as is the house specialty, cumi bali (a grilled cuttlefish in sauce). Recommended
5
Great experience visiting the restaurant we got introduced to the dishes and got some recommendations on what to order. Food taste was great very fresh and smooth flavors. If you are around is worth giving it a visit
4
Great place for good Indonesian food! Beef rendang and mutton rendang were excellent. Chicken sate was also very good and our kids loved it. We also had kangkong sauteed with garlic. Everything was really good. Lime juice went well with the food. Highly recommended!
4
This restaurant used to be located at Duxton Hill. Good to find it again after so many years. The new place is much bigger and the upstairs is air-conditioned. We ordered Chicken Satay, Beef Rendang, Mutton Curry and Sayur Lodeh (vegetable curry) - they were delicious. The price is still reasonable. Good place for business lunch. But do call ahead so that they could set the table for you
1
There is no fixed price specified on the menu. We have clarified the waiter and was told that it goes according to the portion and hence we have asked for the smallest since there are only three of us and we were still full then. When the bill was presented. We questioned on the price as that was not the lowest range on the menu. The boss(he should be the boss) attended to us impatiently that it was priced per head. We responded that they should make it clear on the menu then. He went on to say we should have told the waiter which portion we preferred when we ordered, we told him we did and he just walked away. The food is not impressive and the attitude is undesirable
4
Staying in Chinatown for 3 days and passed restaurant on way to eat a Chinese meal. Glad we called in here instead..the food is fabulous! More of a cafe than a restaurant but that suited just fine. The ikan bakar really is a lovely dish. Priced a little high I felt given that it's a cafe but would go back in a heartbeat
5
So I occassionally work in Singapore so have tried most of the larger more well known restaurants but generally I prefer the small, family run authentic joints.This place is a 5 min walk from Carlton City Hotel and Oasia along the Tanjong Pagar Road and you could easily walk past it with all the competition in the area. I'm a big fan of indonesian food so have to rate this highly as the food was top notchThe waiter who is the nephew of the owner was really helpful and gave us ideal recommendations also taking into consideration our individual spice tolerances which was a really nice touch,Ordered the prawns to share , chicken satay, spinach, potatoes, okra, and the chendu dessert. The chicken was cooked to perfection, nice big chunks with a strong fresh seasoning and bursting with flavour.The side dishes of spinach, okra and potato were also fragrantly seasoned and a fantastic accompaniment to the prawns and chickenThe prawns truly were my favourite dish. One of the best Prawn dishes i've had in Singapore and just the right amount of flavours beautifully combined to include, lemongrass, chilli, onion, sweet and spicy sauce.Generally Singapore I find has a good standard of food and especially seafood but this was above the usual high standardI would definately recommend this little family run restaurant to anyone visiting Singapore. What a lovely accidental find. I will 100% be bac

This was a good find, it's an unassuming mom-n-pop kind of place, tucked away, with very basic amenities and slightly corny decor. But a restaurant's main forte is the food. I was happy that the food was good, tasty and seemed freshly made. The flavor so we're good though a tad spicy for me (but that's fine, I've that problem most places). The hosts were friendly, genuine folks, which I way prefer than the overly sophisticated but fake friendly ones. However, I was just surprised at the pricing of the food. For me the value of the meal and ambience also matters. While the food was good, and the place friendly, I wouldn't expect to pay three star prices. For the meal alone I would give this place four stars, but for the value of the whole deal I rate it lower... For the amount I got charged, I can get an equally good meal with much better ambience
4
It would be all too easy to walk straight past this little Indonesian restaurant without noticing it, but you'd be missing out. This is a delightful restaurant with friendly service and even better food. The chicken satay was wonderful with a great balance of spice and flavour. For dessert, I ordered cendol - something I'd heard a lot about but had never tried before. Given the disappointment I usually feel towards Asian desserts, my expectations weren't high but I was very pleasantly surprised. I'd definitely come back
5
Been a patron of this restaurant since it's early days at Duxton where food was great but aircon was absent. Now more spacious and food quality has remained high. My Son is a great fan and so is the rest of the family. Their Ikan Bakar, chicken satay, ladies fingers and bayam are our Favorites. Chendol is also heavenly. Staff are friendly, especially Fiona and Eugene.

On business alone and new to SG, I really wanted some great Indonesian food to remind me of my time living there and was surprised how few Indonesian restaurants there seemed to be. Amid all the Korean eateries, I was delighted to stumble across Cumi Bali. Alas, it was closed about 9 pm on the Fri eve when everywhere else was jumping, so I tried a second time on the Saturday and wondered why I was the only one eating there. I was delighted to see tempeh on the menu and ordered it but after a minute, the lady of the house came out to inform me that they cannot cook it for one person as there are too many spices (over 40 I think she said) and it takes too long. I was disappointed to have to re-order and said I would happily have settled for a simpler fried tempeh dish but it was not to be. This puzzled me as tempeh is a very basic dish in most of Indonesia but never mind. I settled for chicken satay, rice and eggplant with a drink of lime juice. The food was ok but I grew worried that the meat was a little pink inside. It was probably me being overly cautious as I suffered no after effects. Generous portions and good flavours but somehow, it was not quite what I expected. Maybe Balinese satay sauce is different to the type of satay sauce in Java? Somehow, I was not convinced how authentic it is but it was still a nice experience.I liked sitting outside beside the plants which create a little shield from the busy road. It is simple, cosy, homely and unlike many neighbouring places, not brightly lit which I like. There are not many places where you feel comfortable going in and eating as a single female. I would go back to try some other options from the menu if I have another chance one day
5
Staff and service were very nice. Excellent Indonesian food. The place is small and not so attractive from the outside but inside is great spot. I recommend very much if you like Indonesian food. They have a choice of spicy and not spicy food.
4
Great Food, So close to home cooking, easily accessible location too. The only downside to this restaurant is probably the waiting time for the food to be served. But oj well..super worth the wait! The sambal belachan is a must try!
4
I've eaten here a couple of times and the food is always great. The stuffed squid and beef rendang in particular are delicious. Highly recommended
4
Overall food was yummylicious except for chendol, the ice is not fine enough to melt in yr mouth. ..
Do try otak fish, brinja, sotong, rending. ..enjoy. .
5
The restaurant is very small and simple but the kindness of the owners makes the atmosphere very enjoyable. Everyone is ready to give advice and explain the indonesian uses. I found the food very tasty and well cooked. The price is right for a restaurant offering such high quality food! Reccomemde

This is a very interesting mixed area, with government housing, gentrified Singaporean houses several with bridal shops occupying the ground floor, and a local wet market.My companions ordered quite a feast, including honeyed chicken skewers, squid, beef rendang, oxtail soup, prawns with lemon grass and a cendol for desert. I liked it all very much indeed.The place looks rather basic, but the food is good if a little expensive.Service could be better
3
1. Food is very average for the price you pay, and the service you get, I think it is not worth it. My only recommendation is the Satay Madura (honey skewered meat) and Cumi Bali (grilled squid), otherwise I would have given this place a 2-star instead of 3-star.2. Service staff not attentive. For an empty restaurant (just our table), you still have to wait 15 minutes and constant "Excuse me" to get the attention of the lone waiting staff playing with his phone
3
Will not recommend this place, lunch approx S$33.00 for each person. It over priced not a budget place to eat. Too X for the food and nothing special .. especially the vegetable dishes $$ will frighten you out
5
Lunch after traipsing up and down these lovely streets of varying finds and sights - really surprised at the quality and taste - food is lined up behind a glass counter and you pretty much select by appearance and guided coaching from the staff - however - we did engage the locals and added the oven baked chicken dish (named________) and the charred barbecued chicken dish (named_______), ochra dish (named_________) was surprisingly spicy (and good, not being a real ardent fan of ochra...) and the iced dessert with gelatinous things and green things and some hard lychee nut on the bottom?Sorry - not able to provide names or much guidance but would gladly recommend it for anyone a bit adventuresome and in the hood - and I'd visit it again!!Careful with the hot spices they provide on the side - I said CAREFUL.... don't rub your eyes, or do anything foolish... ya hear
4
Very good indonesian food. The place is small and not so attractive from the outside.But inside is a jewel on food bonanza.I strongly recommend going there if you like indonesian food. Availability of spicy and not spicy food. Good as well for families with children.Staff very nice
5
We were referred to this place as casual, authentic, and home cooking style. Well, we really enjoyed everything we ordered!
The service is very friendly and prices are attractive.
We definitely recommend.
4
My cousin took me here during a short visit in Singapore. Our dinner was great. The upstairs dining area was spacious. The food was great. And the service was very polite.
5
Traveling solo for work and found this spot near my hotel. Great food--get the chicken satay! The staff was extremely friendly. Overall great experience. I'm in SG about once a month and will definitely eat here again.
2
I have ordered a very yummy sambal fish, beautiful rendang, tasty nasi goreng, sweet cendol and very ordinary chicken soup. The chicken soup is nothing special at all. Couple of boiled potato, carrots, carrots and few pieces of chicken. It charged $16. Seriously, I can easily made that at home. This chicken soup is definitely 200% over priced
4
I went to Cumi Bali with three colleagues from the office to have lunch.The restaurant itself is neat and rather small.We ordered fish (which was really-really good), an aubergine dish (nice), a cabbage dish (so-so) and one more dish with meat that was also fine.I did not pay so I am not sure about the price, but it is definitely not a budget place to eat.If you like Indonesian food then I can highly recommend to give it a try
3
This cozy restaurant is tucked away from busy streets of CBD area but it is walking distance from either Tanjung Pagar mrt or Chinatown mrt.For anyone who has been to Bali, you will immediately feel the little stint of Balinese ambiance once you stepped in. However, once the lunch crowd and dinner crowd comes in, the ambiance disappear quite instantly. Due to the small space, everybody's conversations seem to be really loud.As for the food, it is only average. It is nothing authentic or delicious like what you can find in Bali. Personally, I feel that some of the items (in fact, mostly) on their menu are way way over-priced.Quite unlikely that I will return for another meal, unless it's an event organized by others
2
The squid and fish were fresh but the spinach dish was too grainy or should I say sandy. It was not very pleasant chewing the veggies with sand sediments in it just because they were not properly washed. The price for each dish considering the size or portion was exorbitantly high.I think the interior decor of the restaurant needs an overhaul or renovation
5
I love this restaurant. We went last year and came again for this trip. Utterly delicious food, served quickly, with friendly flare. The two of us had one chicken satay (tender, flavorful, plenty for two as an appetizer), a marvelous shredded spinach with garlic. Again one portion served two, one portion of rice and the squid, which is spectacular. The profusion of real and plastic flowers and twinkling lights (it's Christmas time) could be tacky but it's not. It's artless, warm, delightful. There are lots of trendy places on the street but Cumi Bali is a snuggle with great food, comfortable ambiance, very reasonably priced. A large group had reserved the upper room and seemed to be having a great time but downstairs it was quiet. There's also outside seating
5
In the heart of the China town district this place is well located. As we are from Bali we thought we would see how they do Indinesian food in Singapore. And we were pleasantly suprised. The food was fresh and full of authentic indinesian spices and herbs. I had the Goat rendang which wasnt too spicy and full of flavour. My partner had the ayam goreng with loads of herbs and spices on it again gull of flavour and very indinesian. Vegies was the fried spinach and the egplant.Service was wuick once we ordered and the staff friendly the restaurant is small and cozy and clean. Well worth the visit.
4
we enjoyed the restaurant as it had a variety of dishes covering a wide spectrum of taste. We went for the chicken barbecue which was meaty and tender. It reminded me of a dish back in the Aristocrat restaurant in Manila. Even the sauce is quite similar. The kangkong was very tender as well and delicious. The squid seemed a little overcook as it was more rubbery than I am used to. Finally, the lamb rendang was different to what I had expected and was very flavourful. we will be back
4
We had the Octopus, Satay and some other small dishes. All of them were really good in flavor. Overall the food was super tasty.
4
good fish, cold beer, two small and nice table in front of the Restaurant. providing acceptable temperature outside. very friendly stafff.
3
The restaurant looks and smells rather cheaply with its batik tables covered in plastic and the open kitchen at the back. Food is good quality, though (the beef was OK) and the service is good. The bill is not cheap, all considered. There are better places in the neighbourhood
4
Small, simple resturant, serving rather authentic Indonesian food. I recommend their flagship dish, the cumi bali - grilled cuttlefish under a spicy peanut sauce, it was really good. A dish of beef stewed in a similar sauce was good as well, but not so remarkable -- and the serving was very small. I had a typical dessert called cendol, I would say it was interesting - so different from a western dessert - but I was not particularly impressed
3
They say it is authentic Indonesian ford but I wouldn't know one way or the other. Had lots of dishes......Squid is slightly sweet. Shrimp is spicy but not too hot. Chicken satay is good but to sweet for my taste. Baby spinach with fried shallots garnish was good but too watery for me. The food is good and reasonably priced. Downstairs is small. Simple plastic covered tables and minimal utensils make this a casual easy place but reservations are highly advised.
4
Like another reviewer, we were aiming for another place on a Monday night (tonight) but it was closed so ended up here. This was my husband's second visit and my first, definitely not our last!We had our young baby with us which I thought might be a problem with the small space inside (there is an upstairs too), but the waiter welcomed us warmly and helped make space for the pram.We had fresh lime juice which was exactly what we needed after walking 30 minutes across the City in Singapore's best humidity. We ordered spinach, squid and king prawns with rice.I cannot say a single negative thing about the food - every dish was delicious and even though the sauce for the squid and prawns looked identical in colour/ texture the taste was distinguishably different with lemon grass and ginger - really wonderful.The only down point was that the spinach and rice came some time before the squid and prawns, so it was cold and this wasn't helped by the plastic plates.Overall rate this as 4/5 - had the food all come out steaming hot at the same time it would have definitely got a 5. Service was friendly and quick - so we will revisit again soon for sure
3
We had dinner here last night. Our orders were Tahu Telur (Egg-Tofu) and Ayam Balado (Balado Chicken). Both meals appeared to be totally different from the authentic Indonesian.The tahu telur resembled omelet with minced tofu and diced paprika. It is supposed to be fried tofu & egg, served with peanut sauce. And the balado chicken was deep fried crispy chicken. The original recipe should use blended chili+garlic+shallot as the marinate.We guess Cumi Bali has their own version of authentic Indonesian food. It's quite disappointing. Although the crispy chicken was good, but still it was not balado chicken
4
Was hoping to try another restaurant nearby but it was closed so just stumbled upon this little place. Nice family run place, simple ambience, delicious Asam fish and nasi goreng. I'm from Malaysia so it's not as if I'm easily impressed by this fairly standard cuisine
5
i go with my fren last week for our dinner~~ restaurant make us feel like we at Indonesia~~ Food make me feel so surprise.. Its so delicious~~ i will come & eat again~~ i Love Ice Kacang~~ & the bbq chicken stick but i forget the food name already. other food also super nice~~ already jio my other fren to go together~
4
My wife and I really enjoyed our meal here. We arrived just after the lunch-hour rush and were told by the lovely woman who owns the place that the food you saw sitting in the heating trays was just to show the lunch crowd what each item looks like. She said our meal would be made fresh. And yet my wife saw them take some items from the trays and go back into the kitchen and come back out very shortly thereafter with our meal. The food was very good and yet we left less than enthusiastic about it due to the story she told us. Maybe by going right at the height of the noon rush you will get truly fresh food
