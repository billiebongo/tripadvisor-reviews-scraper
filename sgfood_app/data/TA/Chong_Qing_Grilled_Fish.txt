Small seating area with fish smells all across. Vegeterians please avoid. Non-veg folks keen to experiment must visit.

Amazing early mid night supper place! Fish is fresh with variations on how you would like it. They serve a good range of beers too.

Quality of the fish is average. It is completely over run by the strong spices.
Many dishes were either too oily and salty.

Food so so for 1 time tried and experience this restaurant is very crowded. Staff will only allow you to seat in once your members all arrived.Service staff are very quick to clear your empty cutleries as they would want to clear the tables for the next group of guests if there is a long queue

Always long queues and the waiters will ask u if u have done reservation. A bit pricey, but can try it once in a while. The stir fry vege are oily, non of the foods are less oil here. Don't come if u r on diet or a healthy lifestyle perso

The place is mostly crowded especially during meal times. For two persons, we would usually order the medium grilled fish (spicy flavours for us) and adding some ingredients (same page where you choose the Flavours to go with the fish) along with the grilled fish. Portion is good enough for two. Do order a drink or a beer to go along with the food to beat the spiciness! Standby tissues to wipe off the perspirations.Worth it if you're willing to wait in the queue. Service staff are very quick to clear your empty cutleries as they would want to clear the tables for the next group of guests if there is a long queue. That's your hint to leave.

First time visit Chong Qing grilled fish at Liang Seah st. The food quality was excellent and worth the price but the service I think there a lots of improvement and more training for certain staff down there including the supervisor whose in charger of the store I Guess ? Rushing for order as the last order is 7pm plus , questions us as we are the staff working down there y our family member haven't reach their store ? Or simply just show the rude manners he got. It really a bad experience where u pay for a price of this kind of service u been serve too.

One of the best meals we had in a week of eating out in Singapore during a recent visit (including several of the more prominent trending). Super fresh fish, great spices, brilliant broth we couldn't stop ladelling til all gone. Also, although fish is the main focus here, other menu items were just as good - do not ignore. Located in Chinatown but away from the chao

We were pleasantly surprised by this restaurant, as it is located in a street were most restaurants have their staff outside trying to entice customers into their respective premises. We decided to enter after looking at the menu, but we were really expecting the classic tourist trap of poor food and high prices. We ordered 2 fired ducks, spicy prawn soup, rice and five fruit juices, which came to a grand total of $s93. We were very surprised at just how good the food was and the quantity (we found it hard to finish everything). The service was good, but a bit insistent, we were asked to order after sitting down for only 30 seconds. The location is a little off the beaten track,but with Singapore being quite small you're not that far from Bugis street or even the Bay area. The restaurant itself is clean with modern decor but nothing special. Would definitely go back

Love the spiciness of the grilled fish, a few types to choose from. I would suggest first timer spice lovers to get the medium level of spiciness so you can still enjoy the taste of the food without burning your tongue. Be sure to go early as there is usually a queue during peak hours. And they do not take online reservations

If you are craving for super hot food, this is the place that you should be visited. I have ordered for the least hot grilled fish but turn up still very very hot for me.

We were here 2 times. Food is good and tasty, but at the second time we noticed that when we order big fish, at other tables fishes were much bigger than our, other people were local. At the first time we had the same smaller fish for the price "big". When we asked the manager about this, he didn't say anything and didn't apologize to us. Very poor service

We were sat in our nearby hotel when we suddenly decided that we did want to get something to eat even though it was late. I had walked down Liang Seah St earlier and was impressed by the atmosphere and buzz that was on the closed off street and how it seemed less sterile than inside the malls. We strolled down as most places were closing and went here as there was clearly many customers inside - including families with young children. Inside the place was small, very 'basic' and bare and we were worried that we had made a mistake. However, the staff were helpful and friendly and the food took just the right time to arrive for it to feel cooked to order. Portions were about the right size but the mains were so tasty we decided to have another due to our greed - this arrived with a slight variation in taste confirming it was cooked to order. Would recommend food for that good homemade non processed type. But if a visiting Brit be aware that the surroundings are not like a cottage tea room

Received excellent service from Maggie today. She was flexible and accommodating, not calculative and a big picture person. We ordered their promo dish, mushroom fish, the mala cold chicken and dou miao vege. The portions were good and tasted good too. One of our fav restaurant.

Been to both the restaurant at Liang Seah and Mosque St. Always enjoyed their mala grilled fish with thick vermicelli. Their diced chicken and cold chicken are our favorites too. Staff are friendly and responsive. Fish is of good size. One of our favorite haunt with family and friends.

They have different way to do your fish (from non spicy to someone who want to take challenge).Order some side dish to go with the fish which I myself would like to have potato, kelp, lotus root cause very well with the fish.I will also order some cold dish (cucumber the salad, bean skin with some cucumber and straw mushroom) which help to ease the spiciest of my fish. It is also good to order a glass of ice cold iced plum jasmine tea which help to get the spiciest off.Average price: S$20-25/person

The interior is not too spacious, with seats arranged close to each other and conversations within earshot. Coupled with the fact that the grilled fish was served piping hot (no, really...), we felt like a steaming can of sardines, with the aroma of grilled fish to go with.We chose Pickled Cabbage hotpot. My companions may be panting like dogs after less than a few scoops but I have to say that I enjoyed the way the pickled vegetable mix with the spicy gravy swirling in the metal pot. True to its Szechuanese root, the tingling numbness of my tongue was unmistakable, the sensation mixed with the irresistible picker taste.Chong Qing Grilled Fish is truly worthy of the constant queue. I had only tried this one spicy taste and if I have a chance, I would love to try another one of their taste, maybe challenging myself to another level of spiciness if I dare

Went there twice with friends. As we are not which type of fish had little bones, staff recommended us snapper. As for flavor, hot and spicy was their best seller. For those who are not spice-lover, can request for less spicy. It is indeed delicious. We also ordered side dishes like salted egg toufu as well. Will definitely return again!

A local food critic gave a review of this restaurant and spoke very little of their fish dishes but instead gave thumbs up for their dong bo pork ( something like that ). I tried almost everything in the menu. There are better fish dishes in other places. Nothing spectacular. On the pricey side. Service is below average. Personally I dont find anything special about the so called dong bo pork
