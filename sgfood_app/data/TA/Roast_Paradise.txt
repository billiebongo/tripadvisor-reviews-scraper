Not big on roast meat myself, but this shop does a rather mean char siew / siew yok. A bit pricey relative to other similar places, but well worth every dollar and person ahead of you in the queue.

Got to be willing to wait in line...
Make sure the supply is still there to avoid disappointment when its your turn to order.
Rice and noodle not that fantastic though.

Stumble across this stall during lunch, because of the long queue and many paper articles paste on the display window. Decide to try the noodles with char siew and roast pork, the food brought me to heaven, noodles were al dente which we local call QQ (springy), char siew was moist and burn to a perfect texture, roast pork skin was crispy. What more it come with complimentary cabbage soup which is also very tasty. Like it so much that I decide to take away 200grams each of char siew and roast pork for dinner. After so many hours the roast pork skin was still crispy and char siew still moist. Stall owners are very humble and obliging, willing to go the extra mile for you. Downside is the chill is not spicy and the meat very pricey, for the price of 200grammes of meat I could buy a whole cooked chicken or roast duck

There are several variants of this very popular South East Asian dish - one version is prepared with a more fatty cut (hence more moist) and the other is from a leaner cut.The roasted pork served at Roast Paradise is more moist while I prefer the drier variety, hence the 4 stars.Nevertheless, I love they way they prepare it.Call ahead to reserve and pick up to avoid being disappointed

So, so good. Roast pork and Char siew... we didn't even bother with noodles or rice. The burnt-ends of the char siew were sensational. I was second in the line at 11 am just before 'Roast Paradise' hawker stall opened... and the line that queued after me was long. The pictures speak for themselves. Go.

Was at old airport road hawker center for our favorite kuay chap, but turns out closed and started to look around for alternative, saw this store at the corner and the queue was quite long, so decided to give it a try, waiting time was about 15-20minutes. We ordered their famous cha siew and sio bak, total of $9. The looks of the meat was pleasant and can see the glaze of caramelized honey over the cha siew.... When you have them inside your mouth, you're in paradise! Nothing else matters, that's how good!! Don't worry about the queue, it is worth the wait.

Crisp & nicely roasted char siew that melts into your mouth, simply awesome. The noodles are unique because they use meepok (instead of the mee kia that most cantonese roast stalls do in SIngapore), but what's even more interesting is their sauce base which is just addictive. Will come back again to try their rice (sold out early)

This restaurant which is a hawker style is rated the best for roast pork in Singapore. Easy to get to and not far from Mountbatten metro station, it is closed on Mondays. Advice is to get there early for lunch ie 11.30 am. There was a long queue when I arrived at 12 noon. Pork was absolutely beautiful, also had the char sui pork as well. Fantastic. They always sell out tyhe 30+ kgs of pork they cook each day. Open also for dinne

This meal was one of the highlights of our trip to Singapore. On getting to the hawker market and locating the restaurant we were not surprised that there was quite a queue, it seems that if you see a queue in Singapore when talking food then just join it and you will get a great meal. The roast pork was wonderful, sticky, well charred, moist and delicious. Unfortunately when we got to the front of the queue they were out of rice, so we ordered some noodles as well, which was also very enjoyable

I went to Roast Paradise because I figured the long queue indicates that there was something good waiting at the end, and I was not disappointed. The char siu (premium) might have been the best I've had in my life. The flavors were heavenly and the texture perfect. I'm going to line up again.
