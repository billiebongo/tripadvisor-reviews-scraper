Went there with some old friends, led to the back room with a small table & en-suite karaoke system. Food was good, karaoke was fun & even the restaurant owner belted out a few songs! She is a very good singer!

Good value lunch sets. Service staff are friendly and cheerful.
Went there for dinner as well. The la la soup was great, highly recommended.

We just wanted to take a small lunch before going to the city, but we fell in love with this place. So nice and the food is great, you can take everything from the card and it is very cheap for singapurian circumstances.

Great food, friendly service and cheap beer (by Singapore standards). We ate outside and there is a nice vibe around the area.

Old time coffee shop atmosphere set up in Chinatown. Great food and ambience to go with it. Serves a lot of homestyle familiar dishes.

Their express lunch sets from S$5 are value-for-money options for the busy on-the-go office workers. Select your main from a list of more than twenty local favourites which include fried rice, mee goreng etc and includes a drink.The restaurant is popular with the weekday lunch crowd so do come early. Though small, the place can seat up to 24 indoors and probably another 8 outdoors. Service is friendly and fast and there is free WiFi too

I never knew that eating the Chili Crab would require having to eat it with bread. The Chili Crab has a delightfully delicious sauce and you put the sauce on the bread and eat it. The Chili Crab was so yummy together with the Cereal Prawn and vegetables that we got. This restaurant is worth going back to

We happened upon this place and stopped because there were a lot of local eating there. We had a seaweed soup that was very good. Also had garlic and onion chicken and some stir-fry noodles and a broccoli side dish. All of it was very good.This is a hole-in-the-wall place. Come as you are; this is not a dressy dinner out. However, it was reasonably priced and good. The pedestrian markets are a street or two away. There are many other restaurants in the area, so if you decide this is not the one for you, there are definitely other options

Decided on this place while looking for somewhere that did Chilli crab in Chinatown. The restaurant is on the side street of the road across from the big mosque in Chinatown so it's not bang in the middle amongst loads of other restaurants. It was busy with locals, they had tanks full of crabs so we gave it a go.The girl asked me to pick which crab I wanted but I asked her to pick for me. She asked if I wanted male or female, she said you sometimes get eggs with the females so I asked her to get me a male. I ordered one or two side dishes like rice, vegetables and noodles along with beer and a soft drink. The meal was good but the chilli crab is quite messy ! Although the side dishes were pretty cheap the crab was a little expensive ! Although it looks like a Chinese establishment ( and the name ) I think the staff were Thai. Decent place but nothing special !
