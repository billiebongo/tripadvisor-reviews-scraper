Been here since they opened back in Woodgrove.
I must say service is fast during lunch hour where there are lesser crowd compared to dinner time. Food preparation time is ok. Pricing ok too. Recommendable for lepak or family makan plans.

Went with a big group and food was served promptly.

Food is average but the range is impressive. Briyani and north Indian fare is not bad. Lots of types of prata, some fish and crab dishes. Not very expensive and the portions are generous. Good for family dinner.

I enjoy time having prata kosong & teh tarik here. The prata here is big and slightly crispy outside, most importantly itâ€™s not oily. So far, this is the best I ever had in Singapore.They have other dishes, but prata kosong is my all time favorite

Great place for variety of North Indian and South Indian food at food court prices. The outlet also offers huge selection of Thai and Malay delicacies. Please not that the Al ameen has relocated from wood grove location to woodlands avenue 9 for quite some time however the taste and service is the same. We tried chicken tikka masala, keema masala and butter chicken along with butter naan. All the entrees were cooked to perfection. We would definitely go back again whenever we get a chanc

Nice restaurant to have oriental food. Some Indian dishes are not up to the test but few are very good. Chicken Tandori will frustrate you but vegetarian dishes are quite good. You should try their drink - green apple is the best. You may also try Chicken Masala (N26) with Garlic naan

Really late at night the service was really happy and smiley. It looks like a hawker center but it's actually just one restaurant where all the dishes come from different kitchens at different times. The food was not too spicy for us and we enjoyed the atmosphere there. The portions are large and very reasonably priced. The desserts were really lovely too

In speaking to some people I learned that Al Ameens was a much liked favorite among the expat community in Singapore, and upon arriving there for the first time I found it was generally a favorite among the locals as well. It is good Indian Food, if not served in the cleanest of settings this food is cheap in comparison to usual Singapore prices and is really very good. Having eaten there a number of times I would highly suggest the North Indian food, and the Prata is also very good. Although I don't particularly like Milo done with water, to those who are visiting Singapore the Milo Dinosaur, Milo Godzilla and Milo King Kong are all, to my knowledge, exclusive to Singapore so are worth a taste, as are the fruit juices, which are fantastic at pretty much any hawker's stall type arrangement. Typically I would get Naan, and a selection of sauces (I would suggest butter chicken, chicken tikka masala and yellow daal). A good place for sharing food. Again, although the prices might seem average, they are cheep for Singaporean standards

Love the butter chicken, nasi bryani, lala, masalah tea... love most of the foods here. u will never ruin out of choice at here.
3
Absolutely love the dam chicken briyani!! My favourite! The only thing i dont like it that drinks are self-service at the counter... Other than that, be nice to the waiters and they will be helpful!
4
halal, affordable and open till late. Some place for malay friends to gather and catch up over a nice teh tarik and some bee hoon goreng.

food standards are mediocre. Ordered the prawn biryani and was charged between 6-7 dollars. However, the prawns are frozen. You expect freshly served prawns for the price you're paying for. I would say the dishes are overpriced for the quality.
4
You may not get the best of services in SG, but you will get good food and worth the money. Large variety to choose from as well.
4
Try the milo godzilla.... and the briyani. They have variety of Indian foods and lotsa staff manning the place

I am absolutely gutted, because after 11 years of eating at Al Ameen weekly, it has just closed and moved to Marsiling. Bottom line is that their North Indian food is the best value for money Indian in Singapore. Their malai Kofta and Chicken Tikka Masala are highlights. Pair it with some garlic Naan and you are in spicy heaven

We found the Roti Prata and Masala Dosa to rival food stalls that have been rated in the Singapore top five. We especially like the drink bar offerings of "Iced Tea Tarik" , Kopi Tarik, and Iced Kopi Tarik. Give this place a try. While not appearing like many of they newer, more upscale air-con food courts, this is the real, classic Singapore at its best

Try this once when my husband managed to pack banana prata and cheese prata. It taste nice. Worth 20 mins queuing. As this is hawker and always crowded, so not so convenient to dine in, so I just recommend to just pack and enjoy at home

i was there to get some dinner for the family but was turned off by the malay malaysian workers especially the western food stall attendant. not only he was rude, he has no customer service at all!i left the premise and head down to another place to purchase my dinner!will never get any from them anymore
