Been eating here for years now and always leave the restaurant super satisfied! 10/10 will recommend
5
Came by the cafe with my dog and sisters and everyone of us loved it. Food was slightly on the salty side, but we loved it so much. Owner was friendly and so helpful with recommendations. Coffee was so good.
4
John wasn't there when we went, but the food was still rich and flavourful. My only grouse was that the mushroom soup was not heated evenly through, which signalled to me that it had probably been reheated via the microwave.
5
The steak was amazing! The pork chop & chicken wings were really well marinaded.. will definitely recommend & go back there!
4
Tried their terribly troublesome pork chops with mushroom and it's excellent! The cafe has nice ambience and service.
5
Really love how their best seller (Clammy Addiction) lives up to its name. together with the choice of adding Chili padi really brought the pasta to a different level!
5
We arrived at Pasta J after walking at MacRitchie Reservoir Park. The Caramel Carnivore Pasta has a very unique home-made taste mixed with salty and sweet flavor. The Terribly Troublesome Pork Chop is tender and juicy and the butter sauce is creamy and goes well with the pork chop. The Muddy Mushroom Soup made of pork bone stock has a very strong garlic and pork meat flavor. The overall dining experience is splendid.

I really liked Pasta J. Honest food with that "home-cooked" feel, none of that prettified tarted up concoctions you might get in CBD. Set in a row of old-school shophouses, just off the construction site they currently call Upper Thomson Road, the ambience is clean but eclectic. Seating indoors and outdoors. Service throughout was prompt and friendly, and plain water served too! (thumbs up). We had the soups for starters, followed by mains (stout stew and lemon yoghurt chicken). Desserts were pandan ice-cream and midori sorbet). Portions were perhaps small, if you're a millennial, or just right, if you are of a different generation. Flavours were wholesome and genuine, making for an enjoyable evening repast. Pasta J is dog friendly, and you might round the evening off by having a chat with your friendly canine neighbour. What's not to like
5
Owner is passionate about his food. I like how he even paid attention to details such as the chilli flakes and salt - he added more flavour with extra ingredients (I canâ€™t remember what magic he did!). Owner explained the heart work put in to prepare the steak. I was doubtful about having steak at a pasta place but this dish proved me wrong :) it was worth the price.The spaghetti was a little on the mushy side but it was strong on flavours and the chicken was tender, just the way we liked :)The dogs added to the fun ambience

This has been a favourite haunt for my friends and I for a while. We love their soups (some would say a lil on the salty side, we find it quite flavourful). The food is good to great and the the owner, John's, recommendations are usually spot on. The only drawback is that the food is very rich and therefore, can't be a regular thing. BUT we do look forward to our next meal there every time. Enjoy
4
Went to try with friend's recommendations. Ordered the Break Up steak and was impressed with the quality and taste of the steak.
5
This is my third time here and it was once again a wonderful experience. The staff are really pleasant and love dogs! The owner even came out to our table to feed my dog. The caramel carnivore pasta is a must-try.
3
The soup were really food. We had clammy pasta (the clams were really small) and it was average. The wings were bad though. Oily and I didnt quite enjoy the taste. It was weird
3
Pasta J is on overdone, overblown place. Tackily decorated with random unrelated quotes, desperation seems to seep through the walls. The owner fancies himself as better than Michelin star chefs and even says so. His first attempt is to push the most expensive items on the menu. They don't serve by the glass. And the pesto with prawns that I ate kept burping up till late night. Ew. My Friend had the pork with mushroom and she too left most of it untouched. The redeeming factor of the place is that it's pet friendly. I'd avoid it.
2
Steak was great. But pasta and the sides of the steak were burnt. And very expensive for the amount of food given.
4
Been a while since my last visit here.. came to revisit familiar well-loved flavours like stout stew with mash and salmon carbonara! Tried the pandan ice cream this time too, it came in such a small cup we were wondering if it was the side sauce to go with the real ice cream. But apparently they churn almost all the air out so it's a very dense ice cream, hence the small serving sizes.
5
We have our kitten with us and looked for a pet friendly place, great food. First we were warmly greeted by John. Many pet cafes do not have great food but offer convenience for pet owners but Pasta J surprise us. Love love love the desserts. John even paired my pasta with beer!! I will go back definitely. Only minus is car park

The place was dark and empty for a weekday lunch time. One had to press the bell for service. There was a note stating that the staffs were busy in kitchen.Pasta J's Nitro Coffee ($6.90+)Cold-brew coffee infused with nitrogen gas is released through a pressurized valve with tiny holes and as high pressure forces the cold brew past a disc, it creates a creamy, stout-like effect. Smooth, clean, lovely cold coffee with a much silkier mouth feel and there's a cool factor to a nitro pour when you see the coffee cascading. Winey sweet with a bit of prune and chocolate. Absolutely delicious!The coffee was light and chocolaty in taste. It really looked like stout.Mad Mac & Cheese 3.0 with Pork Sausage Patty ($16.90+)Beloved bacon and caramlised onions cheese sauce with short pasta and a sausage patty base.Not the usually kind of mac & cheese, as it was not the cheesy type that one was expecting. But it was kind of rich and creamy meaty sauce. Felt that the patty was a tab dry.The Ultimate Kaya Toast ($6.50+)Home-made kaya made with only coconut cream, not cocnut milk, egg yolks, no egg whites and so much pandan leaves. Smooth, velvety, eggy, coconutty and oh so fragrantThe toast was light and crispy. The filling was kind of savoury but not the usual butter taste. It was more of a unique taste.Service was not bad with ice water refilled regularly

If it were not for the fact that dogs are allowed, I can safely say that it would be highly unlikely for us to patronize this place. Almost impossible to find a dog-friendly eatery here in Singapore, this is a rare opportunity of dining in air con comfort with your furkid and enjoy a yummilicious meal. Parking though is a bit of a hassle, so when the new MRT line opens, it would be good for families to visit. Though it's name is Pasta J, it also serves great steaks. The Super Striploin was simply awesome! Juicy and tender as how it should be. The Clammy Addiction, MacCheese and soups were all without fault. In fact, we tried both the Muddy Mushroom soup as well as the Tomato soup. Very thick and flavorful. The owner John is friendly and a dog lover too... definitely will recommend to our other friends with furkids.

Decided to give this restaurant a try since it's pet friendly and can't bear to leave the little ones at home. The food was surprisingly good. We ordered steak, pork chop and their clam pasta, all were good. Prices are not cheap and seating is not the best, but if u looking for some places to have nice pasta and dog friendly, can give this a try. Reservation is recommended as it was pretty crowded when we wen
4
Tried 3 times and always experienced good service. Wholesome Chicken Soup Pasta is one of my favourite pasta, the chicken is tender and gravy is light yet tasty. My friend who are fussy with food like their pasta too. Thumbs up!
4
My first visit there with my dog and friend. Service was excellent , food is great as well.
Will be making more trip there.
5
Service was good. We tried the pesto chicken pasta and the seafood laksa pasta. Both tasted good! Place is ideal for catch-ups!
4
Pasta flavours were unique and interesting. I had the caramelised carnivore. It's slightly too sweet but I still loved it. Dog friendly environment gives the place a positive vibe. Will come back to try more!
5
Salmon carbonara was really really good. Salmon done really well, moist and tasty. Liked the desserts as well, especially the creme brulee!
5
We decided to try out this restaurant along Upper Thomson road, in view of its good reviews. I agree with the other reviewers that the restaurant is unique in 3 aspects: a very friendly owner who knows his food and beer well, being pet friendly and excellent value for money food. Try out the super striploin, it can compete with many famous steak restaurants around the world.

Not the usual pasta you find in Singapore. For example, I had a pasta on caramÃ©lized onion with meat balls. There's also a yoghurt chicken one. The pasta sauces were delicious but I also like the way the pasta was cooked- not soggy, just right. Efficient, polite service throughout. A nice experience
5
On a Sunday afternoon a couple of weeks ago, 2 of our very good friends brought us to Pasta J for the first time. They told us that Pasta J is dog friendly but we have to ensure that our dog do not dirty the place, in which I strongly agreed.I must say that my husband and I were very impressed with their quality of food. Every dish that we had were very well executed and tasty. The pasta we ate were even better than what we had in some of the restaurants in Italy.The service was excellent and staff very attentive.Will be back soon
5
Introduce overseas relatives to Pasta J, they love it so much that they requested going again (which is 2 days later) before they depart Singapore. They had the same steak, beer and creme brulee for both times. Service was very personal and the atmosphere is friendly
5
Service was good, ambience was good, food portion was huge for the price that it is sold at. Though i ordered caramel carnivore which was slightly disappointed as it wasnt to my standard, but as it was not my first time there, i think clammy addiction is really really tasty. Clams were so fresh. Overall combination tastes like heaven! Must try
5
Savoury, sweet, you name it, Pasta J has it! Every dish served tasted superb. Staff was extremely friendship and courteous. Good ambience too. Worthy of a return visit!
4
Mushroom soup is quite good, I also like the yoghurt chicken pasta. Prices can be a little steep esp for salmon and steak, but service was excellent.
4
Cosy cafe with tasty pasta. I liked the Clammy Addiction with fresh clams and prawns.
It was strangely empty on a weekend at lunch time. Definitely deserves more customers.
Service was warm and friendly.
4
Knew the owner through a friend. His service is very clear-cut, helps us decide our food faster and easier. All his staffs are very attentive and friendly. The atmosphere there is very nice and more importantly, IT'S PET FRIENDLY! PRICE wise, a little on the high side BUT will go back again.

Food - For Starters, we had the Muddy Mushroom Soup. Taste was fine, it did not really have a strong "Mushroomy" taste as I would like. For the Main Course, we had the Pork Chops. This was nice, tender and not dry.For Dessert, my co-diner wanted the Midori Sorbet. I was chatting with a guy (whom I guessed was the owner of Pasta J) and said that I was not keen on Honeydew flavour but was looking for a sorbet type dessert, so he suggested a cranberry sorbet. This was super sour, but devine. Too bad it was so tiny. Ambience - The place can get a bit noisy when crowded, so if you want to have a quiet meal, come early when there are less people. I love that you can bring dogs into the restaurant. The guy (assumed to be owner) was very welcoming to a large dog which a group came in with. The restaurant and bathroom had alot of quirky signs. Makes it a interesting place to visit.I will definately visit again to try their other dishes

We were staying at the Oasia Hotel Novena and the tripadvisor map showed Pasta J as a few hundred metres from out hotel. We liked the reviews and made a booking for dinner. However we could not find the restaurant using the tripadvisor directions. We rang the restaurant and were told that it was a 15 minute bus ride from where we were. Clearly the tripadvisor map was wrong. We cancelled our booking which was unfortunate as we were looking forward to the dinner. If you are planning to dine at Pasta J ring for directions and don't rely on the map
5
This was my second time at the restaurant and I must say it is worth every buck you spend. The food are all just prepared so exquisitely and done so tastefully. The steak is indeed one of the best steaks you can get for such a low cost. Even though I ordered Medium done, the meat was still so tender and juicy, easily cut with the knife. The lamb shank we ordered was also so tender and went so well with the pesto sauce. Another must have is the muddy mushroom - mushroom soup in a cup! It's a good start to your meal :) Another interesting thing we had was their liquid nitrogen cold brewed coffee. So unique!Overall, it is a great restaurant that is definitely affordable.
5
Don't be fooled by the name Pasta J. Besides doing great pasta, try their steak. No sauces needed. Just some garlic salt and home made chilli salt to complement it and make it amazing. Been craving for it since! Completed our meal with the lemon curd with sour cherry dip. Lovely shortbread. Dog friendly too! Perfect.

We'd read about the great pesto at this restaurant and decided to pop by for lunch.Since we went for a late lunch, we were the only folks in the restaurant. The lady who owns the restaurant with her husband seated us and walked us through the menu.My wife tried one of their pesto pasta (with prawns) and I had the lemon chicken. We also ordered a side of wings to try out.While the portions were fairly large, the food was fairly average as per our palate. So overall, good service but probably not the right flavors for us
5
Didn't expect to find good steak at a pasta place. One of the best steaks I've had. I really enjoyed their lemon curd with cherry dessert as well. Make sure you try their clammy addiction pasta too! Best thing about the place? Dog-friendly and yet, super hygenic and clean. Will definitely return
5
Every time I visit Pasta J, the food never disappoints. Their pasta is my favourite but of course not forgetting their signature steak is great as well.
5
The food was fantastic. Loved the chicken soup which was flavourful! Heard raves about the steak too. Will try it next time!
5
Delicious food, served simply and without fuss, with enthusiastic service reminiscent of the kind you get in the US. My second time, and still excellent food and value.

Recommended by a friend who feels the food at Pasta J is value for money and so we decided to give it a try.The owner sat us down and checked if it was our first visit. When he found out it was, he passionately shared that this is a restaurant and not a cafe and that he should probably dress more formal instead of his t-shirt and jeans, he also went on to share about the amount of love and time that is put into preparing each dish and how some customers commented that their steak is better than Morton's. Thus setting our expectation higher.However as we were in for a quick meal, I had to interrupt him and make our orders as I wasn't sure how long more the introduction was going to last.We ordered the caramel carnivore and salmon carbonara (recommended by the owner as one the best apart from the steak on the menu).Interesting that they uses salmon and green peas for their carbonara. Hubby still prefers the classic carbonara with fried streaky bacon.The caramelised carnivore has well caramelised onions with bits of pulls meat and meatballs. I felt the meat balls were a tad small thus not as juicy as bigger sized meatballs. They also served cream on the side for this dish. I tried it both with and without cream and preferred it without cream.The boss is definitely interested in his business, as he came around to check how we like the dishes
5
Warm and cosy restaurant with no frills, perfect for any occasion, date night, family night, girls night out! Ordered the AMAZING mushroom soup (10/10), clammy addiction pasta (perfect for bacon lovers and super generous with clams), grilled steak (SO TENDER), and ended the meal with classic creme brulee and chocolate dark cherry cake. Highly recommend!!!!

Helpful service from the owner in helping us in finding a space to change our baby daughter's soiled diapers. The L-shaped seating provided space for her to have some tummy time... Thank you!On the food. The various pasta creations were unique and my family and I enjoyed them. For myself, I ordered the Seafood Laksa and it did feel that I was eating laksa more than pasta. The seafood that were in it were fresh and tasty. The mushroom soup served in a mug (which I drank without using a spoon) was not too creamy (which I liked) and I noticed that it had pieces of carrots in it which was unusual. However, I think it could do better with less garnishing (think it was pesto) on the top. On the drinks, my dad ordered the cappuccino and enjoyed it and the alcoholic beers were not the ones usually served. The only drink that was a bit of a letdown was those that were in fact packet drinks. Would be helpful if such drinks were actually labelled so as not to have such experiences. Lastly, the service staff require some improvement in its service.

Had lunch at this place after my facial appt which is just next door during Christmas eve. Food tasted fresh and from the heart. Order the mushroom soup, salmon carbonara and pesto pasta. The mushroom soup tasted different from usual, it's not the thick and creamy kind but tasted more like a fusion soup. But I like it cos it tasted different and the soup was piping hot.Pasta selection was not the usual choicea where u can order from pasta shop but I must say I'm quite impressed by it. Will definitely go back to try the other dishes. Service was attentive and good too

Choped a table at Pasta J for my mother's birthday celebration as she likes pasta. We ordered the salmon carbonara, clammy addiction, striploin, pesto prawn and beef stew and mash. The prawns were a bit too salty for my liking but the rest was very tasty and done very well. The striploin (very juicy!!)and salmon carbonara was especially memorable. Owner John very kindly gave us a creme brûlée on the house cos of my mother's birthday. It was the best I've had in Singapore. The pandan ice cream was also special.

We recently ate here and tried a wide variety of items on the menu.We liked the tandoori chicken wings and laksa pasta. These were very flavourful and well executed. The chicken wings were nicely roasted and the pasta was al dente.We tried the pesto and crackers. While the pesto was very tasty, it wasn't what I expected in a classic pesto - robust flavours of roasted pine nuts with fragrant, herbaceous aroma of basil and a hint of garlic in nutty extra virgin olive oil. Perhaps I am a purist in more ways than one. Why mess with a good thing? Just let the superb quality of the ingredients speak for themselves.The pesto at Pasta J was complex. It had hints of anchovies or some kind of seafood pulverised into it. It so had an overpowering taste of cheese in the background and just too salty.Another dish we tried was the tomato soup. It tasted like pulverised canned sardines mixed with some tomato. Again, this was a very tasty soup but it had a metallic taste reminiscent of a canned soup.The most disappointing and revolting dish was the pasta with tomato and mushroom. The mushroom was nicely sautéed and the pasta was al dente. There was no tomato other than a very one-dimensional cloyingly sweet tomato sauce. The sauce tasted like sugar syrup mixed with a splash of canned tomato sauce. This dish is worthy only for the rubbish bin or the compost pile.The other very disappointing aspect of the totally unpalatable pasta with tomato and mushroom is that the restaurant suggested that dish to one of us who specifically asked for a diabetic friendly dish.The pace of service left much to be desired. We ordered three laksa pasta dished. The second come about 20 minutes after the first and the third came ten minutes later. The time lapse between the first and last entree was about 45 minutes!Because we politely waited until everyone's food was served before eating, most of us ate our food cold due to the extraordinary long elapse time. The restaurant was hardly busy; there were only two groups totally eight diners!Does Pasta J delivery extraordinary flavours as it advertise? Well, not really but you do get extraordinary long wait time and extraordinary callous food suggestions if you have dietary concerns

Visited twice so far. Friendly boss who is always in a red shirt. Introduces his signature dishes for first timers. Have tried their mushroom soup which is very yummy. Pesto plus crackers is great too. The striploin is indeed juicy with tasty side dishes. Found out that they do not have wine by the glass. Otherwise It would be the perfect companion to the steak. A full bottle would be too much for myself. I foresee myself coming back again if I had craving for Italian food in a nearby location from home
