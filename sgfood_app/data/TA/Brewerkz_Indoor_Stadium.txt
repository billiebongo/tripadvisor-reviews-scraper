always back to Brewerkz for its 3 little pigs pizza.
pork knuckle's good too with tom yam dipping.
the place is very chill vs. the other branch at riverside.

Was there with an old friend starting the year with a Toast! Had couple of Fresh brew & finger food. Onion Rings Serving was yummy & large. Wheat Beer is Fruity & Just Sweet enough. Crew was friendly & helpful
3
Requires to book if there's concerts or functions at the stadiums. But the service is slow and the servers are not attentive. We had try a few times just to get their attention.
3
Was there on a sat and our order arrived much later than the other tables who came later than us. It seemed like they forgot our order. Food wise, taste is usually consistent and fairly fine. Big servings.

Overall the place felt understaffed. We ordered the sausage & mash. While eating, I found a splinter the length of 0.5cm in the sausage. Luckily, no harm done and we gave feedback to the staff when we paid the bill.
3
Food portion was big but waiting time is too long. Not much options for vegetarian. Chairs are not very comfortable.

I frequently go to Brewerkz with my futsal team. We like the food quality that never drops and the nice outdoor seating arrangement after sports.

Extremely stuffy indoors. I asked for a switch of table but was flatly refused. Staff cited the reason of ‚Äúfull house‚Äù. Tables might be booked, but the eatery was barely half full. I do not see why our request to switch tables was rejected. I was given a menu but nobody came to take orders. This is something I REALLY dislike when dining out. It took a long while to get the attention of the busy staff as well. Seems like the eatery is I‚Äôll prepared for a SMALL crowd on a Friday evening. After our meal, we walked towards the restroom and that was when we realised the other end of the eatery was not stuffy or hot at all. Was there something a first timer diner did not know about? Not to sit on the other end of the eatery, but to only insist on a table near the pool table. Will not patronise again.

I had the pork knuckle and it was really good. Portion size and price also very good.Burgers also looked great even if I did not have one. I would next time. However, we tried all beers and most of them were not really drinkable. The Pilsner was good. But not more. Maybe the wheat beer and K√∂lsch also ok. The rest, don‚Äôt try..

This restaurant is inside or outside. We ate outside. Food was good and appetizing. Beer range is extraordinary with local microbrews and many international special beers. Beer price varies according to time of day being in three ranges. We were there during a thunderstorm and rain protection could better. Area covered with large fixed unbrellas but joins are hit and miss between umbrellas. Dining here is an enjoyable experience. Value is typical for location

Drinks & Food were good but service Abit slow though not many customers. Bill took awhile to come. Love the Brew
4
Great venue close to the National Stadium showing live sporting matches and pouring some pretty good craft beers!
Pool table also available.
2
3 pigs pizza below expectations vs picture on menu and as recommended dish. Meat tasted stale. Slow service
4
Food was great and service was attentive although the tv was a little too loud and the aircon on the left to the entrance could have been air-conditioned.
4
Lunch menu had pretty good choices and the food was delicious too! Waiting time for food to be served was slightly longer though, but won't hesitate to head back again!
5
Good place by the river side . Special house brews and finger food . Has a pool table and can watch TV inside . Both indoor and open seating available . Good for a large group .
4
Want beer, go to Brewerkz, Beer for all type of beer lovers. Food, sharing plate is the way to go, order the platter, good enough for a group of 4.
4
When they're busy, the service suffers. Food is consistently good and portions are big. Good value on beers.
3
Food is just alright. A place for the beer variety. Indoor is very noisy and stuffy. Outdoor subjected to mosquito bites.
3
Good food and beer as always but lack of service staff was noticeable. Orders and requests took longer than expected, had to ask for extra sauce and colouring paper multiple times before finally receiving the requested items. The establishment should either hire more service staff or use tablets for taking orders and requests to speed up the service
4
Food was good. Ordered National Day special pizza, was fine. Service is not bad too. Dont miss the free flow soft drinks if you aren't there for the booze!
5
Visited this place couple of times. However this time round, we were served with very good customer service and of course food is always great at Brewerkz.
3
Very quiet place to chill on normal days .. but not on event days .. food selection is average .. good drinks
5
For many breweries around the world I am constantly disappointed but this one however ü§ôüèæüç∫ Thanks! #GnarlyLyfe üççüéíüåµ

Spacious and outdoorsy outlet in Stadium area, just perfect to have some cold ones here! Tried the seasonal tap, Black Raspberry Ale and it was great. The Pulled Pork Sandwich are good too, it could be better with some crispy toasted sandwich perhaps, the panini which were served together were a bit dry
5
The food in brewerkz is superb but the dish that I recommend the best is the cowboy burger with the mashed potato side dish... That dish is like one of their best sellers and I can see why because their burger is extremely delicious... The brewerkz indoor stadium restaurant has a really nice scenery with the sea behind the restaurant with the billiards which anyone can play if they just pay around $2-$3 for one game.. The thing that I like the most in brewerkz is the fact that you can have free unlimited refills ( ONLY for the soft drinks) but I would say in my opinion, if you try the Cowboy burger with the mashed potato side dish with any drink then it would be one of your best meals that you have taste

Liked the selection of beers, buffalo wings, nachos. Hamburger was a little underdone for medium and 2 dishes left off our order, probably due to crowds for the show. Ham and pineapple pizza came with jalapenos which was a little odd although still tasty. Wine is a little pricy. Good size servings.I'm not sure I'd go here unless I was seeing a show, and then it's a decent option vs nearby
3
A good place to chill out. Car park nearby n a Goodview of the opposite side which runs like a lake. The drinks pricea vary as per timing. Earlier u go better the price n deals. Tge food is not bad though we were here for drinks mainly.
4
Great place for a family dinner. Ordered the 3Pigs, which is a combination of sausages, baby back and pork knuckle. All very well done. The beer is super smooth and superb to wash done all these meat. The pool table present another entertainment for the boys.

This restaurant/sports bar has recently been renovated; the new layout is closer to that of a typical American sports bar like restaurant interior.For the outside seating, which is better at night if you prefer a quieter dinner, as long as the weather is cool. This being a brewery, serve beers that are brewed locally. Don't think the actually brew of at this restaurant itself, as they do have another brunch. Plus they sell bottled/mini-keg version of their beers; so it is unlikely those are done at this restaurant itself. Lunch sets are cheap and good. Depending on what is ordered, some portions are big, others are alike typical Asian sizes. So order with care.Dinner are the same size, but cost more. This is probably this vicinity has little visitors during the day hoursThere are seasonal beers to try. And they also offer a set of sample beers which you can order. Am a repeated diner for this restaurant although not a regular

This location offers you the possibility to enjoy brewerkz in a nice relaxing environment and nice view to the city.
Stadium MRT is located nearby.

Me and my other half cycled around most of the city and stumbled across this place, good food at lunch which was very well priced.
5
The newly renovated Brewerkz at Singapore indoor stadium is fantastic. Good food and good service. This place will be around for a long time to come if they keep this up. Well done and all the best.
5
The food is outstanding and its one of a kind the restaurant allows you to watch soccer whenever there is a Live soccer match and you can enjoy by eating some lovely burgers and some extraordinary side dishes and desserts
5
Me and my girlfriend love the place because of their relaxing view and great service from the staff plus great choices of different booze.
Will definitely come back again!

Met up before the rugby, the place was very busy, managed to secure a table for 12, considering the place was very busy all the burgers turned up and the beers were good
4
This place is quite isolated by Singapore standards and located in the Indoor stadium. Was almost vacant on a Thursday night. Service was very good. Indian pale ale was light and nice. Chicken wings was good but not the best I've eaten . Batter fried calamari with a spicy sauce was good
4
Good sports bar food with a fantastic location across the water reservoir. The buffalo wings were excellent but what was exceptional (and not very healthy but who cares! ) was the Pork knuckle which was crispy, tasty and great as bar chow. Service was good and the beers cold.
4
Go to this place just to try freshly brewed beer. They have a huge variety of beer. We tried wheat beer which was great. We tried veggie pizza which was okay. The place is very quite and peaceful. The best time to go there is before 7pm when beer is priced half. Must go place for beer lovers for sure
3
Brewerkz restaurant has never failed me in terms of the quality of their beer. The small bites like the sweet potato fries and buffalo wings are delicious. But i prefer non spicy sauce.The only downside is the happy hour does not extend the same price throughout the day (with increasing $$ with different period) which i am not attracted to unlike some other crafted beer establishments which serves $10 throughout the day
4
Nice beer, but a bit ex on e food.
Go before 7pm happy hour. Try to go for lunch on weekend,$20 burger + beer.üç∫üç∫üç∫üç∫üç∫üçªüçªüçªüçªüçªüçªüçª

Came here for Easter, had a nice bouncy castle for the children. Staff are excellent, while waiting they provided our children with crayons and colouring sheets. Beers are excellent with decent bar food to match. A bit difficult to find but would definitely be back again

We usually went to the outlet at Riverside Point but decided to check out the outlet at Indoor Stadium since it is near our place.It is generally quieter and less rowdy as compared to the one at Riverside Point. Service was okay. Nachos with the beer chilli was amazing! The wagyu burger was also worth the try and not to forget a glass of beer
3
The beer is good. And the food is exactly what you'd expect. But it's generally less engaging than its Riverside Point counterpart, and it is no longer the leader that it was on the island for beer or food. Still worth it for a quick bite and beer, and the kids and lunch menus are good value.

8pm on a Friday evening. We asked to move outdoors, were told "later", the third time it worked.Beer choice is good, as are the cocktails. Food is limited, especially for vegetarians. We ran out of snacks we could order, due to the limited choice.Service was not great. One of our party of 15 was a non-drinker, and it took me 3 reminders and 15 minutes to get someone to take his order

I went to Brewerkz with my wife before the Singapore tennis tournament at the end of October. We arrived shortly after opening and were only one of two occupied tables in the restaurant. As is typical with Singapore, the service was slow, but the whole experience went down hill from there. My wife and I ordered drinks, which took nearly 10 minutes to arrive. My wife ordered a burger and fries and when the food arrived the fries were cold and it was clear they had been sitting out for a long time. We asked that the fries be re-cooked, so they took the whole plate (with the burger) to re-cook the fries. By the time it came back the burger was then cold as well. Again, we were one of only a few occupied tables in the restaurant, so no idea what was going on. I ordered salad with dressing on the side and salad came without dressing. They manager then proceeded to tell me the dressing was already on it, which it was not. By the time we left, my wife and I were so frustrated with the terrible service, lack of attentiveness, and poor quality of food despite only a few occupied tables. We will not be back

We weren't familiar with the area and chose this place as it's a familiar brand that we occasionally go at Clarke quayTables are close together and it's a little messy, but it's ok. Even the ribs fall off the bone and rather edible. The draft beers also always reliable It's ok for a quickie dinner as it's not the main event, the concert i

Tried to eat there on Saturday. Trying to get in kids charging in and out and zooming round on scooters.On entering noticed a large group of young kids tossing pol balls across the table and screaming.The waiter tried to show us to a table adjacent. I declined and asked for one to the right of door.He said oh that's closed - several people (staff or customers I don't know) were lounging there.I asked to see manager. He came out and steadfastly refused to sit us somewhere quieter. But reluctantly we took table near open door. He said he would speak to the parents of these little horrors and he did and the effect was they became louder.They literally screamed and shouted and threw balls on the table - that will make it a good surface for playing I am sure!!The whole group didn't seem to be eating but he didn't have the guts to tell them to leave.So this potential paying customer left.I wont be back - the place has really run down since my last visit and its a disgrace.In the end I walke

I've been to this bar on a few occasions. The service is always a bit hit and miss but the beers are nice and the location is good. The main problem for this place is two fold 1) they fail to prepare for sporting events by not having enough staff on; and2) they refuse to open up the second outdoor area due to not having enough staff on. This issue has happened on every occasion I have been to the bar. The second outdoor area is merely and extra 8 or so tables immediately next to the 'open' outdoor area. Two times I have been here I have asked for a table for two and wanted to sit outside but as they didn't have enough staff they refused to let me sit immediately next to those people in the open area. I'm talking moving a table for two 3 metres into the 'open' outdoor area. Both times I have left and ordered at their competitors after failing to convince them and extra table of one person isn't going to overrun their existing staff. A lack of commonsense is costing this place a lot of business which is a shame as the one at Clarke Quay is very nice.

The Brewerkz at Stadium has a lovely location, right next to the Kallang River. It is picturesque at night and seating indoor or outdoor is available, although outdoor is far more interesting. Overall, there is a good selection of meals and snacks on the menu - good if you are in a hurry. We noticed that this has also become popular with dog owners. Their is a good selection of beer and wine but the cider choice has been streamlined to Brothers only. What ruins the evening though is without doubt, the price. A one course meal for 2 people with one drink each cost over $130. It is a shame that this restaurant has become so overpriced. A venue where we may have frequented once a week is now only visited once every six months
