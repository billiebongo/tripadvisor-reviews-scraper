Food was good (surprisingly for my family) and the kids love the fries especially. Live band performance also provided nice atmosphere for friends/family gathering.
5
It was nice to be back again. Service was great and so were the beers. Definitely coming back again.
4
Went on a Friday evening where they had a live band. My guests had a great time, food & beer was excellent, and the live band added a nice touch. We had a exciting & memorable time.
4
nice place for a meal with family and friends. good food and music, thou we found music a bit too loud (we sat indoor). staff friendly and great craft beer experience
5
We stumbled across this brewery while having an over nighter before an early flight from Singapore the next day. The staff were all very friendly in explaining how it worked (you pre top up a card which you then use to self serve your own beer of choice) and we’re always on hand to offer assistance. Long beer benches made the atmosphere outside jolly and although we didn’t eat there, the food being served to our neighbours looked great

The restaurant is different to others when wanting a drink. You put money on a card and can go to the beer pumps with a glass and sample whatever you want. It does not have to be a full glass, half a glass can be just a sample to see if you like it. Other soft drinks are also available. The amount you take is then taken off your card. If you do not use all of the money it can be kept for another time. You order food and pay for it when you have decided on your choice. Food was good. The tables are generally long wooden benches, very rustic. Reasonable prices

One of the best places to spend weekend.This restaurant is near Changi beach. Loft interior design and U campus furniture style. Feel like back to school time when dining here.Live band starts performance ard 7.30pm on weekend. Diners may request their favourite songs. It’s quite difficult to park during weekend.8 kinds of tap beers stand in a row. Diners may help themselves. Prices will be calculated based on volume. There are weekend special menu.Angus beef is a must try dish. It’s so juicy and tender, seasoned very well. Presentation is pro. Cook skill is as good as Tuscan steakhouse. Lamb stick is Indian style with yogurt sauce. BBQ pepper and cucumber is also yum. This is one of the best places for family, Friend and coupons to enjoy weekend. Eating steak with various beef, listening to the live band and enjoying sea Breeze. What a wonderful weekend

I rented a bicycle at East Coast Park, with the aim of riding clockwise, in from the east coast, then generally following the Park Connector network of bike paths. As a lover of craft beer and having read a review of the LIBC in the Sydney Morning Herald Travel section’s list of 6 of the best microbreweries, I aimed to stop here for Lunch. Whilst the PCN was poorly signposted in places, the brewery was easy to find and near the ferry terminal.It was Sunday and they did Sunday Roast for lunch. Whilst hot, humid and slightly rainy, is not necessarily roast weather, the roast lamb was fantastic and a massive serving, served up on a wooden board, with roast veggies, mashed potatoes, Yorkshire pudding, and all the trimmings...heavy winters food, not cheap, but just what I needed after 25km of riding with a hangover. The beer was great as well. You pay $2 for a card and then put money on the card for beer, which you serve yourself by tapping the card on the tap that you want beer from, as you watch the credit remaining on your card drop. Great concept. As I was riding, I couldn’t drink much, but by filling my own, I could have a little of all of the beers I wanted to try. They had a reasonable standard range and some seasonals...quite fresh and mostly lighter styles of beer because of the weather...enjoyable and refreshing. The tables themselves are like in a big shed...spilling from inside to outside. Probably would be too hot outside if it was sunny, but I sat inside due to the rain. Live band at lunChtime was passable. I enjoyed it...was a struggle to get back on the bike and do the remaining 25km, past the new airport construction and back to the start at East Coast Park

Great concept behind this place - from how food is presented to getting drinks to seating to entertainment. Enjoyed the live band and outdoor picnic tables. Lovely home-brewed non alcoholic drinks. Beers were decent, not the best. The corn was way over-cooked but the other salads and vegetarian options were great
4
Although expensive, this brewing company and restaurant offers good food and a unique self serve beer tasting method that will likely catch on in other countries. With picnic tables outside and banquet tables and chairs inside, one should not expect much comfort but the beer, food and related ambiance help you forget your nether regions are numb
5
Great night, great beer, great atmosphere & great service. Only question mark, good for the carnivores BUT no veggie food.......
4
Few things are better than chilling out with a beer in hand. Visited more than once - the food is consistenyly g ood and so is the ambience. Almost perfect.
5
It was a great evening spent with friends and family over a pint of good beer. The live band was a plus and the atmosphere puts one in a good festive mood.
1
We had a very bad experience with this bar, they treat badly their customer. Ambience is Good but the attitude of the manager are disgusting and very rude, the manager don’t know how to respect customers.
4
Interesting concept with DIY tap beers. The bbq meats stole the show for me, they were good. More only gripe was that the portions were inconsistent and a little small for their prices. Like the sausages were value with good portions, but the beef brisket though good was just 1 slice. Other than that, it the food was good
5
I was given a plastic card by Glyn whom I met in Jacob's Cafe the previous evening. He had just completely a project here in Singapore, and was returning to the UK the following morning. The card entitled me to draw a pint off the taps at the fascinating micro-brewery, here in the heart of Changi Village. Housed unpretentiously in what looks like an industrial unit, the place makes few concessions to its new or regular clients. On entering I was taken in hand by one of the friendly staff, and after explaining the process, I was soon swiping my card, and filling my pint glass up. I am not usually a fan of most micro-brews, having tried endless samples in the UK, Australia and New Zealand, and with few exceptions, I think they are a complete waste of good hops and malt, adulterated as they are with all kinds of rubbish, including grapefruit, so woe betide you if you have an heart condition. I have to say that of the 8 beers on tap at this site, all of them without exception or contradiction were superb , both light and dark. The credit on the card was still working , so having noticed food being served at one open end of the venue, I ordered 500grams of fresh red snapper, with salad, big chips and other trimmings. It came on a zinc salver, and had been prepared and grilled to perfection, so with 2 more beers on tap, each different but just as lovely, I was a very happy bunny, sleeping like a log back at my hotel, the Village in Changi. I have to say, so impressed by the quality of the food and ale, I returned for an encore the following evening, this time managing to wade myself through the remaining suite of ales, and enjoying a plate of several grilled meats, with cleverly matched sauces, enjoying them hugely. Go, go, go, before I come back
4
Have visited several times, both the Steak and the Burger is super nice. They have a nice concept where you fill money on a card, and you can then tap your own beers. Sometimes, you need to ask to get the taps adjusted by the crew.
3
Firstly the live band was extremely loud, waitress was helpful enough to find 2 seats for us, self service food with $9.00 voucher anything u like with some exceptions, think the $9.00 was only a limited time promoFood was ok but don’t expect it to be piping hot, a good crowd on Saturdays, worth a visit if you are into live band
3
Came here on an overcast Friday afternoon about 5pm. As to be expected there weren’t many people there so the place kind of lacked atmosphere. $20 for a beer card to pour your own beers, but the problem is the beers are over carbed so you spend $10 a pint for half froth basically. The Hawker centre is literally across the park and I was really jealous of the guy who paid $5 for a long neck of tiger beer over there. Overall I can’t judge too harshly though because I am sure the place is magnificent when it is in full flight

Went with a group of friends recently. The setting was quite nice with breeze etc, long tables and band playing - albeit a little loud, but good tunes regardless. There was a system where you queue up in the food ordering line ( with only 1 cashier) to simply get a prepaid beer card to enable you to go to the other side of the premises to pour your own beer. My card was for 2 beers. I poured the first pint and got just over half way through the second when the card value ran out. TIP - don't expect 2 full pints for $25.00. Ordering was a little slow due to only one cashier and many people actually deciding to look at the menu when they arrived at the cashier rather than actually know what they want. The meals were fast to be delivered and were ok - a little expensive for a burger really, when it is a simple burger.The next trip to the self-serve bar saw no glasses remaining - dishwasher must have broken down or gone on strike, so plastic cups were the next best option !!The quality of the beer is average at best when compared with Brewing companies like Beechworth, Holgate, Bright, Tallboy and Moose etc. They need to do away with the card and self pour system and get the brewer to actually be serving the cold pints and talk to the customers.Pleased we went, but probably no need to try again. The Changi Village Hawker next door sells 640ml Beers for $6.00 from Mr Lim at the Happy Coffee Stall. He places in a bucket of ice and gives an extra little bucket to add to the beer if needed. The array of foods is quite extensive
5
You pay to load up a card then use the card to become your own bar man! I loved the concept and the beer was excellent! Great for a beer after visiting the island.
3
Food is good, but the alcohol selection could be improved. twice I’ve been here twice they’re always out of something. The drink system seems to be having technical glitches a lot and it’s really not that convenient.
4
Great ambience with the live band performance. Food is great and we absolutely love the apple spritzer.
5
Best chicken sandwich I’ve had in Singapore. Delicious!! It is a cute brewery that has a nice outdoor space. Great location near the water!
2
Came with cousins (teens to young adults), found the place unsuitable for us as it seems more orientated for the older generation. I ordered mac-and-cheese, and was disappointed by its quality (tasted a little like chewy plastic). My cousin who ordered a “popcorn chicken” felt scammed, as it was more like “fries with a bit of popcorn chicken”. Everything we ordered came with fries, a little potato overkill. The beer/ale were a little bitter to our taste, though that’s just our personal opinions
4
self service restaurant: you buy a card, load credit and thereafter you can pour your beer as long as the credit lasts; quite a variety of beer. Food is good, focussing on BBQ - surprisingly with pork on offer. Nice ambience in the evening, but be careful - just half the tables have a cover; when it rains you get wet.The place is big - would not like to be there on a sunny weekend when it is full
4
Good range of beers to try, better than average by Singapore standards. Have an interesting card system where you pour your own tasters and glasses. Not clearly signed, could be a bit difficult for new visitors to understand how it works and quite expensive comparatively (especially when drinking at scale). That said, good to see the craft scene developing, best to do tasting to get the most out of experience. Service was light but helpful and location is relaxed just by the Changi coastal walk, near the water. Mixed indoor and outdoor setting, great for all types of weather
3
The food is great. The atmosphere is great. The beer is not. You order your food at the register, for which you are given a buzzer to alert you when it's ready. At the register, you also purchase your beer card, which you use to TAP at the self-service beer taps. You can choose any amount of money, and that money is deducted based on the quantity of each beverage you pour. It's kind of a fun concept, and allows you taste the different beers on tap. Unfortunately, all of the beer on tap were pretty gross. The beer had a weird "corny" taste. I don't know how else to describe it. All the beers had this same weird taste. There is also wine on tape - it's also not very good.The saving grace of this place is that the food is great, and so is the outdoor picnic table atmosphere. There was some live music playing... it was tolerable. I would not return, because the beer sucks
4
We organised a Friday afternoon HH drink and we were very happy with the drinks, foods and services of this place. We were there from 5pm to 8pm. We purchased a card and top up credit to purchase drinks that consists of a wide range of beers, cider and wines ( our friend told us that the wine quality was so so...but the beers are great). Foods options are good and prices are reasonable, we had to pay for foods separately as the card only pay for drinks. Nice place given that it was under renovation.
1
I went with my family of 6 and dog, we ordered 4 signature dishes to share and they were disappointing, portions were small for my family of small eaters and quality was not up to par. Sign of complacency can be seen in the sides being all the same regardless of choice of main. Service is pretty DIY so be prepared to come if you are open to helping yourself with everything. However, novelty of having a local brewery is there and worth a visit for tourists who would like to try locally made beer. Ambience was good too, can be a potential office party light reception kind of place in good weather.
3
It's a open concept self service dining place. The place isn't air conditioned. However service was pretty fast.
4
Buy a stored value card from the cashier. Collect chilled glass from fridge. Choose from beers on tap (my favorite so far is Aleyeah). Tap card on sensor of selected tap and start pour. Enjoy beer and sea breeze.
5
Great place, great vibes. Friendly staff and bosses who makes sure you get a seat, food is okay, you're okay and enjoying your time!
Live band on Saturday nights is funny and sings old school music, brings us back in time.
5
Been to this place a few times to bring different groups of friends there. The food is nice, atmosphere is good and interesting alcohol concept.
5
This was our third visit in June and we find it great place each time to have a great colletion of beer and food. We love going back to this place.
4
Live music, good food with reasonable price and big tables host a big group all sums up to a great place for a hang out
5
This is a little secret spot on the East side of the island, really good food, best ribs in Singapore and craft beers. It's only 15 min by cab from Changi Airport, very easy to shoot over for a quick meal in between flights. There's pleanty to keeps the kids happy and the Sunday lunch is just well excellent
5
Post a long hot trip around Pulau Ubin, we stumbled across this place quite by accident.Was a great find.Well set up, a nice variety of beers with a fun and unique self serve, great food and friendly staff.One of the most fun places we came across
5
Stumbled across this place by accident. Beer is fresh and tasty. Good brew master at work. Pale ale was pale ale and ginger ale was ginger ale. S$20 gets you just under 2 pints. They use a stored value card system. S$2 refundable touch card and taps make it convenient to get your beer at the tap. Reasonable price for micro brewed beer that's as good as the stuff you can get anywhere in the US from Sacramento to New York or Austin to Minneapolis. Free flow ice water and ice in case you get too sloshed and desperately need to rehydrate. Open air concept is very cool. Literally and is a nice contrast to sterile air conditioned Singapore. Didn't eat as we wandered down from dinner at the hawker centre. But food looks credible. Normal prices. Good ambiance. Worth the drive out. Chill. Benches and hanging nights make for a very not-in-singapore feel. Would definitely come back for dinner and drinks w friends.
4
Very tasty beer and food. But while I found out how it works, it was a quest! For the first time in a restaurant, the staff looks like a native. When I figured out, I bought a card for 2 Singapore dollars and put 50 on the account, I could not spend everything. There is internet. A place where I will return again, for sure !!!Очень вкусное пиво и еда. Но пока я нашел как это работает, это был квест! Первый раз в ресторане, персонал смотрит как на туземца. Когда разобрался, купил карточку за 2 сингапурских доллара и 50 положил на счет, все потратить не смог. Есть интернет. Место куда я вернусь еще раз, точно!!
4
Excellent place for beer and food. Good live music entertainment by the resident band. There's also swings and slide for the little one
4
Food was really tasty. There is live band during the weekends. Ambience was good with fair lights dangling.
4
Lovely spot at changi village. Beer on tap, charged based on volume, which makes beer tasting easy. We had the wagyu need brisket which was worth the calories and price. Would definitely go back there again. Great atmosphere with live band during the weekend.
4
Nice place. Extraordinary ambiance. Great mix of music. Great concept. Would be good to install mist fans. Maybe retractable shades too. Sample tasting for each beer would be much appreciated.
5
Simply love the place! Indoor and outdoor seating available. A few variety of alcoholic drinks for consumption. The food is scrumptious! There is a small play area for children. There was a live band when I was there on a Sunday evening.
4
Nice place to spend a Friday evening with friends. Nice ambience. Nothing much for vegetarians though
5
Wonderful outdoor seating with views from the nearby market and waterfront. Very tobacco-friendly, so it's a big difference than the norm in Singapore. Beers were great with an impressive and fun card system. I tried most of the beers and was highly impressed. Food was even better, though..! Gourmet dishes with bold flavors and flare served on branded cutting boards that rounded out the sensory experience. My new favorite place in Singapore and it's close by to the Changi Airport - for those who have short stays or lengthy layovers. Check the weather to ensure you maximize your experience. Enjoy
5
What a great place! I love the concept and it's been executed excellently. The food was delicious, I had the roast pork which was perhaps one of the bests roasts I've had in Singapore (and I'm British so I have a high standard of roast! Even the Yorkshire pudding was impressive). It also came with a free kids meal for under 5, which was also yummy. The craft beer on tap was great, ice cold and delicious. And they even got the industrial size ice/water machine spot on. And right next door to the beach?! It's well worth the taxi journey, I'm already making plans to go back...
4
Stumbled upon this when looking for a spot to grab a nice lunch and was pleasantly surprised. Awesome vibe, sitting out in the sun (you can sit in shade if you prefer), listening to great 2 acoustic music act playing covers, with good food and beer. I had the BBQ chicken sandwhich with fries and was lovely
5
Found this place on the first night after 24 hours of travel. So the beer was well received. This place brews its own beer and had many varieties on tap which you pour yourself. Buy a top up card at the bar, then tap and go. The IPA was great. One word of warning, these beers can be strong and go down easily.
4
Went to try it out with family and initially skeptical but the food was really good. Loved the Wagyu beef brisket and crispy pork. Also the self served beer concept
4
Attended my Cousin's Wedding dinner there in the evening. Great set up with care and yes the Beer just great.
Even with 200+ guests attending the food were great ..., certainly be back ...
5
They good different varieties of house made beer. Good choice if you are a beer taster. If you are looking for a place to booze in Changi village, this is a great choice.
They got good food also and price is reasonable. Better try.
4
Tucked away behind the Changi hawker center is this new place for grill and beer from their brewery. We went on a Sat and realized there was a band playing that nite. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Food was delicious and you need to order this pork crackers that go well with the beer for snacks
5
We had spent the day over on Pulau Ubin and started to wander a bit after getting off the bumboat. Stopping at the Little Island Brewing Company was an excellent choice as it was a marvellous spot to end our day. They had a nice selection of food...amazing selection of craft brews (which my travel companion said were fantastic!)...and some live music. All you had to do was place your order and find a picnic table
4
interesting concept of prepaying credit for the drinks that you can collect from the many self pouring stations in the establishment, with a wide selection of craft beers, and a few wines. food available went well with the beers. outdoor sitting is more cooling (weather permit), though there seems to be a fly and ants problem, while indoor sitting is a little stuffy but has less of the insect issue
4
In town for a few days of meetings in the Changi Village area. A small group of us headed out, intending to go the the Hawkers' Centre for a not-very-expensive dinner. Taking a circuitous route by foot we noticed the Little Island brewing Company and headed over for a look.It was not swish, there were a heap of large lined-up trestle tables both indoors and in a large outdoor courtyard. The beer (and wine, if anyone really wants to drink that stuff) service method was quite novel to all of us - from four different countries. You get a card from a service desk and top it up with some $$$. Then you grab a glass, choose your brew, tap the card on the base of the tap, and pour yourself the beer. The cost is deducted from your cashed-up card. The catch of this system is that the card requires a $10 deposit, and we did not remember to redeem that when we left ... making our evening quite a bit more expensive.Later in the evening we decided to also eat there, deciding the 50m to the Hawkers' Centre was way-too-hard. Perfectly acceptable pub-food burgers and the like. All of our party enjoyed their meal.We sat outdoors which was fine once the sun started to sink. It got a bit crowded around the taps at one point, and the place was barely 1/4 capacity, but all-in-all we were happy to have had our evening hijacked by Little Island
3
Came here with two other couples and felt that we we're always going back to the register to top up our card to buy beers, How it works is your get a card and put money on it, say starting off at $100.00 Aussie dollars, you would think that would see me out for an hour or 2, wrong, after getting a card, go to the fridge where the glasses are chilled, wrong, they are in the fridge but it's more like a a small cupboard as the fridge doesn't work, tap you re card at the beer tap and start pouring your beer with what selection your have decided on, from there fill your glass and watch you money disappear from the card as you are paying per mls that go into the glass, We ordered food from the resturant and this is where the place improved, the food was at a reasonable price and the quality of the food was excellent, I'm not really a boutique beer sampler person but I would still go back for sure for the food no so much the tap beer due to the cost of the beer per pin
5
spend a wonderful afternoon at this brewery place. quite a ride from the city center to reach there. anyway we liked the beers and the food was quite decent as well. interesting self service system which we did not mind. a nicely done industrial designed micro brewery worth to explore
3
The Apple Cider tastes like it is brewed from the medical clinic or hospitals.It was last Saturday evening. I wanted to talk to brew master and checked that he didn't pour in cough mixture by mistake. But he did work on Saturday evening.Please bench mark with Strongbow.Also the fries are too salty and hard. Please bench mark with MacDonald.Hope can improve in the future
5
The food was fabulous. The fish & chips, and steak were memorable. Their home brewed beer joyfully tasty.
Highly recommend a visit to this restaurant.
5
Very nice atmosphere and food. Beer selection was pretty good and the dispensing system was smart and innovative.However, band was a bit loud on the weekend, choose to sit further away if you wanna talk with your friends.
3
A great family friendly place with good food and beer. A live band was performing the evening we were there. What more can we ask for?
5
Interesting place with nice food! Tried the steak! It's very good with the beer. There are more than 10 different types of beer there! Absolutely a good and chill place to hang out!
4
Great choice of beer and self serve and so you can have fun pouring. Food OK. Hadn't realised no fries or sauce with steak and at SGD40 would have expected these. Live band on were good and would go back.
5
I was looking for a nice chill-out joint to spend my 19th wedding anniversary with the Mrs & the kids. And I found the nice little gem hidden in my backyard. Great relaxed atmosphere, good food & great beer. Perfect for a laid-back, fuss-free meal with people you care
4
Heard about the place from friends who like to drink but not make a big hole in your pocket, and also love food.This is the right place to go. A good selection of craft beer, all priced reasonably and also varying so you can choose based on taste and how much you want to spend. The servers are nice enough to let you taste so you don't have to waste money in guessing if you will like it or not.On a got day, the golden ale was perfect. And because we were there for lunch, you get a pint for only $5 with a main dish, what a great deal.We tried different mains like the fish and chips, steak, burger. They were all ok and decent, not spectacular though. Anyway, I went primarily for the beer and that was good enough
5
Booked a big table for a catch up with friends for my birthday. Brilliant response to my questions online which was refreshing. This is a fairly no-frills place - order food at the bar and collect yourself and pour your own drinks using a pre-paid card you buy at the bar. But even so the young staff were very friendly. The food is good - the wagu brisket is a must - and the beer is yummy (and strong!).It is a way out of town but worth the drive
5
Glad we finally tried it out. Beers brewed on-site and can be consumed by ml and you pour yourself. You put money on a card and only pay what you consume so you can have a little bit of all the beers. At the time there were only 4 in tap though. Food is rustic and good quality and served on board. Ambience is modern industrial rustic- we loved it and will be back!Great as a cycling stop
5
Visit first time and had an excellent lunch: Porterhouse Steak, with tasty coleslow and delicious acocado salad, melted onions in a vinegar sauce. I don´t need fries, because the lunch was real big. You can take ketchup, chilli and barbecue sauce from an separete selffilling station, also the softdrinks. The price of 25,--sing.S includes softdrink. The price is absolutly o.k. for the quality
5
Good food beer atmosphere and band! Really odd way to buy beer but once your used to it . It's no easier 😂 staff really helpfull. Great night out 110% recommended
4
Fabulous feel, live band and tasty food. Rustic tables and huge open kitchen with fire oven. Love love love. Thank you for the night!
5
Beer is okay, quite some choices around. Ambience is good. food looks delicious. The live music is also pretty good. came as a pleasant surprise to me~
5
Came twice in a week and always enjoy the foods and craft beers here. I like the way the operate and the way the beers and wine being serve. Is it a very good idea as you can pour the amount of beer you wanted to drink with the card which one have top up with cash. Overall the price is reasonable and the beer is good. I recommend this place when near or at Changi Village
3
Followed their hotline's instructions and made reservations through Chope. But when I wanted to call in to check my reservation, the line does not go through as long as it is engaged. Means that I have to redial multiple times just so that I can try to speak to someone. In the end, decided to just turn up and trust the Chope reservation. Only to find out that they could not find my reservation. Asked 2 different service staff, only for them to conveniently "forget" my existence after a short while. Ended up having to approach the boss himself just to get a table, all of which took at least 10 minutes, which is not fair considering I bothered to make a reservation because we were bringing our clients there!Food was good, portions generous. Self-serve beer system also makes it interesting because can try a bit of the beer before deciding to take more. No service, therefore no service charge. That's fair too, I guess. But not sure if I will go back unless for a casual setting only
3
Listen.... I like this place but as a brewer they are rushing their beer. The Singapore Pale Ale has a slight under attenuation where the sweetness hangs around on the tongue. The imperial stout has a solid malt back and roast finish but it only runs in at just over 7% so don't look for the Russian in it. Overall my favorite was the whiter side of pale ale. It had a nice dry finish with a solid hop schedule. Stay away from the amber all together. Out of 7 of us we all could not handle the butterscotch flavor, which ain't supposed to be there. The food is good. So if all else fails drink the pale ale and eat.
3
Love the white & red wine. Didn't like the cider. Good variety and quality of beer. Been here 3rd times, staff are really friendly. Not all food is great. Must have: pork belly, beef brisket and chicken wings. Pork knuckle not good despite 2nd try.Had a great time with my family. One complain : the band is too loud, so loud that the family hard time hearing me when we pass food around, couldn't enjoin the food till band stop.
4
Went here with the wife as we were in a close by hotel. It did not disappoint all the food was good, we were just not prepared for the size of the servings.....they were massive. The Singapore Pale Ale was awesome and a very cool way of self service. Many kids running around and is 100% child friendl
3
This is a nice place to to have an informal meetup with friends or colleagues over drinks and finger food. If you are looking for someone to service you, this is not the place to go.1.Note that everything is self-service. You pay at the food counter with a piece of order paper stating what you want (e.g. fries, barbecue wings) , you get a remote dongle which will ring once the food is ready and you need to collect this. For drinks like Beer , you need to buy a prepaid card, top it up and pay at the self-serving beer section. Even wine is on tap. Cutlery and plates are at one corner, and you need to collect this on your own.2. Wooden tables. Get the ones that are with chairs as the wooden benches may have wood splinters and for folks who wear skirts or shorts, be careful of this. There are ants on the tables so just be careful where you put the food.3. Food not to miss would be the grilled beef steak and port knuckles. Other than that, the rest of the food are average.4. Weekdays are the best to go if you need peace and quiet and to have a more private gathering. Fridays and weekends would be crowded as this is one of the best places for pokemon hunting
4
We were greeted with a very relaxed, non-pretentious and no frills watering hole that served delicious food and you could have fun being your own bartender! We had the ribeye steak, wagyu beef, pork knuckles, chicken wings, portobello mushrooms and mac and cheese and they were delicious if you skip the pork knuckles. There was 4 beers to choose from, each with its own distinct flavours. The staff were always nearby to help you with describing the beer and helping you with getting the best cup. We went on a saturday and were entertained by their band which was great as they played the good oldies! Kids were even dancing nearby which was great. not a first date place but a great chill out place for weekends
4
Nice place (on the beach side) to spend an evening. Weekend evenings are crowded,but nice ambiance. You have live music most of the times.
5
Greatly enjoyed briskets, cooked for nearly 16 hours. They are delicious, soft and something to indulge in as often as one can.
4
If your looking for a romantic meal with your partner or top quality eating, this is not the place for you. However if your after pretty decent pub food and a relaxed atmosphere this will probably bang the right buttons. Your seated at benches with warnings of mind the splinters and the menu is a bit limited, though they make a good stab at what is offered. The sumac spiced whole spring chicken is lovely, as is the sea bass 'fish and chips.' Onto the beer subject. Work on $10 per pint and you won't have any unspent credit. I've not seen this mentioned here, but return the card and they will refund $2. Personally I think the pour your own beer adds to the whole feel of the place.There is a resident band on weekends who cover, and occasionally murder, classic rock songs, though they are good fun.I like the place and have been back multiple times

Located near to the Changi ferry terminal, Little Island Brewing Company has a canteen-style. I wanted to leave even before I was seated. The wooden tables have signs of "beware of splinters", staff are oblivious to the diners, beer is served in a plastic cup from $10 onwards. Do note that you may purchase a value card or order the beer directly from the counter

It is a great place for a casual and relax dining. The embience is excellent with friendly staff, great food and freshly brewed beer. Can be a little hot and humid at times since it is 'open' and not an enclosed restaurant with air conditioning. The plus side is that the diners can enjoy a bit of sea breeze

The beer here is good. The food much less so, unless you like the fish in your fish and chips dry and soft and your pork knuckles oily. As pub food it kind of does the job, but Changi Village has a lot of good eateries, so if you enjoy eating you'll probably enjoy eating somewhere nearby more and coming here for a beer afterwards.What might really turn you off is the too-enthusiastic floor staff who will want to clear your plates and glasses even before you're finished with them. Do you want the last 25% of your beer? Yes I do.As other comments have noted, the stored-value card system doesn't allow for a refund, so a lot of customers probably end up taking the card home with some value still on it (as we did). Otherwise it becomes this huge feat of calculating exactly how much you are going to need to put on your card, which is so complex that you'd just really be grateful if you could pay in cash like everywhere else.It does have a nice big alfresco area, but it's not exactly on the beach so it can get stuffy

I can’t stand their business concept. Customers need to deposit an amount on a “Debit Card” the restaurant provides. Later with this card you will tap your own beer. In accordance to the amount of beer the value will be deducted from your card. So far so good.Now comes the crappy part. The restaurant will not issue an refund on the debit card. Me as an walk in customer will be asked “how much money I am going to spend to top up the appropriate amount on to the debit card”. Lets say I top up 10 SGD and spend 8 SGD only, then the restaurant will keep the 2 SGD.For me it is a greed for money attitude. No thanks - I do not go to places where I am asked how much I am going to spend in advance

A semi outdoor / casual dining place. Food is good (Western menu) and the onsite brewed beer / ales with the tap card (pay only for what you pour) self service system is fun, convenient and fair. Overall expect to spend SGD $20-30 for mains and about $10-15 per pint of craft beer. Fair value, rustic environment, friendly staff (especially Monica... she was unbelievably warm)

Celebrated my birthday dinner there this year and we ordered pretty much all their bestsellers on the menu. The lobster was fantastic, as were their fish and chips, grilled mushroom (though the suckling pig was a bit dry and not very meaty). Their beers were also pretty good that even though me and my friends are normally wine drinkers, we managed to down some good ales that they brew in-house.Wish there were more dessert options and even though the band wasn't the best, they were good sports and took requests gamely. If eating here for dinner, I suggest you sit outside to enjoy the down-to-earth and festive ambience

Love the large space and the outside benches (on a cool Singapore day). On unforgivingly hot days they also have cooling units around so no worries. They also have seats indoors (but not airconditioned)You have to buy a top up card that allows you to buy beer. The cool thing about it is that you can pour between a sip and a pint! However much you want and it comes up to an avg of about 10$ per pint depending on the beerThey have food too!

The beer was fine. Tourists beware of the confusing requirement to pre-load a card with cash. Refuse the cash card and have one linked to a tab on your credit card.
5
We went for the wagyu beef and it was the bomb! It also has its own brewery where you have you can pour your own and pay as you go. Great location if you also want to check out the food centre nearby too.

Was here after recommendation from Channel 8 show. When we were unable to locate them, tried to call and asked for direction while standing at the jetty entrance, no clear direction given and gave in a sarcastic tone. Finally, we found it. Told the lady that we had a reservation, but she seems blur. We grab our own seat and "find" our own menu, nobody even bother to come tell us anything. At the counter, was served by another lady called "Christina"(according to the receipt). Not only smile throughout, i felt as if i owe her money!!When i returned to the counter to top up my drink card, i gave her $10 and my card, her reply was simple, 70cents more. I was like huh, and she replied in 1 simple word, GST. I wonder what kind of services is this!!!!!!!!Food wise, i asked for a medium steak, but served in a medium well steak. Didn't bother to complain as the service was way below standard. Beer battered fish, no beer taste. However, the Crispy Pork Belly does deserve the credits despite all the below standard service. Crispy enough and goes damm well with the sauce on it.Beers wise, yes!! Undeniable they were great.Overall, I dont suppose i will re-visit here agai

We loved our recent visit to this self-serve, self-pour brewery. So much so, we went back a second time in a week to take some friends. You can choose from craft beer or wine and cider. There's an an interesting choice of food which was full of flavour and served on very generous platters. Service efficient and friendly

Used to work around the Changi area, so we came here pretty often. The lunch deals were already amazeballs, but they gave us the option of topping up $5 for a pint of beer! and in case you don't know already, their beer is pretty good.Here are some of the things i've tried here:- Fish and Chips: not too greasy nice tasting fish. goes well with beer.- Beef Brisket Sandwich: a must-have. juicy, succulent. goes well with beer.- Chicken Salad: for when you're counting calories. goes well with beer.And as for the beer, they usually have a good range available, including their stouts, summer ales, ruby ales. I like all of them, so don't take my word for it, head down and try it!

It is indeed a awesome place with great food and variety local brew beers. Some food and beer could change depending on timing. It is self serve and ordering could be quite confusing. You need a beer card (can be purchased at the counter while ordering food) for beer, like a cash card and every top up you need to pay GST. Eg. You need to fork out another 70 cents for a minimum of 10 dollars top up. Nevertheless, price is reasonable. Almost forgot to mention, there is local band performing. So, what are you waiting for?!!!

Happened upon the brewery after stopping at Changi Museum and couldn't believe our luck. Real BBQ and self tapping beer stations in a hip little warehouse near the water. Had some tasty brisket and fries with a few pints of the local brew (I liked the dark but the award winner not so much). Couldn't believe a place like that was so quite on a Sunday afternoon. We got spots right next to the blowers otherwise it was a bit warm. Great stop after the museum or a bike ride along the sea side path. Playground for the kids nearby so great of a weekend outing

This is our first time to the restaurant.Chillax ambience with great food and beer.House brew beer. BBQ lobster,the wagyu beef, crispy pork belly, pork knuckle, a must try. Fantastic food with good quality Live band on every Friday Will definitely return!Thumbs up

Came here for lunch on Father's Day. Ordered from their brunch menu which cost $15 which include one non alcoholic drink. Reasonable pricing and pretty good food. Tried their house brewed beer Sister golden ale ( which is my personal favorite ) which is light and flora And Whiter shade which taste a little bit more bitter. Overall experience is good. Will come back and try the other food on their menu.

If you are looking for a really relax time with a large group of friends, this is the best spot for it. We are a group of 15 in casuals and flip flops, loud nosies and beer drinking group. This place offer good meat to go with their own brew. Staff are all very easy-going and helpful, price is reasonable and you have the ability to try as many beer as you like. Red wine is really good too. We will definitely go back there again and remember this place does not charge service charge, so order your food at the counter and self collect - all part of the social aspect

Lovely brewery and pub in Changi Village. Good range of beers. Excellent food which was good value too.
5
Stopped in for a beer and glass of wine a couple of times on our walks. It's a self serve system after buying a card, with a selection of brews on tap, plus red or white wine. Good amber and golden ale.although we didn't try them, they have a good selection of snacks and meals available

Local micro brewery with good food is just the thing if you are in Changi Village. They have a neat beer purchasing system (you pay into a card and draw down on the card) with lots of beer choices). We also ate there and they have a good menu (heavy on the meat) with great bbq

Who would have thought, craft ale brewed by a Brit brewmaster in Changi. Well here it is and I was not disappointed. I stayed in a hotel a stones throw away and visited the brew house every evening for a refresher or four. Although the place had a few teething problems with its self serve tap and credit system the beer remained of good quality. Even when the taps stopped working they served jugs drawn di3ectly from the large vats. five different beers, all good. Food was of good quality too expect for the ribs which had been overcooked and were chewy. Otherwise nothing to be sad about. A great spot. Be warned its getting trendy so extremely busy at the weekends

We found this place by accident after getting off the boat following a trip to Palau ubin.It is well worth a visit. They have an on site brewery producing excellent real ale. It is mainly self service with a top up card system for getting your drinks. The food is excellent with a simple well cooked menu. We paid 15 singapore $ for brunch which also included a cup of tea and a soft drink. The staff members Francis and Stephen were very knowledgeable and helpfu

Took my wife and four kids there having after one of the owners of Malthouse in Siglap recommended it. The servers are nice but the system is bloody frustrating - the self service system wouldn't stop pouring beer....the whole card system just doesn't work well and causes queues.But then the food arrived and boy oh boy was it good. The brisket was perfectly cooked and seasoned, the chicken was delicious and succulent (I think they must have brined it as it was very soft). Then we tried the ribs and they were beautifully flavoured with a great crust. The only disappointment was the chips- straight out of a packet.I'ts a great venue to hang out and then kids can run round. Just get the beer system fixed and I will be a regular. The wait staff must be near to having a nervous breakdown

2 burgers, 2 beers, side of fries = $80Way more than we expected to pay. Confusing system if you're new, seems like a great place for locals when know what they are doing. Hidden on the side of a counter you place your food order and have to prepay for a beer card, on the opposite side of the restaurant you fill your own beer. Nice place, would have loved to sit and enjoy the ambiance

If you go to Singapore you must visit Little island brewery company! It was wuth out a doubt one of the Best experiences we had in Singapore! The place is cool and rustic, with one huge room with giant wood tables. They have a small but good menu, and they practice selfserve for almost everything, but the staff is very nice and helpfull! The food was the Best we had eating out, and the beers was very nice! I know it is in Changi and that might seem far out for some - but trust me! This is not a place you would want to miss

Slightly passÃ© serving boards notwithstanding, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food here, especially the meats - the kitchen crew here clearly know a thing or two about protein. Came here with friends so we had the opportunity to try a number of dishes - nachos (good, but not a standout option compared to the others), pork belly (well seasoned, great crispy skin), short rib burger (excellent meat, very unique, not sure I like it as a burger but definitely worth a try), chicken (decent, tasty) - but for me the standout by far was the lamb. Barbecued lamb is rare enough in itself, with most traditional barbecue centred around pork and beef. But here they've got something really special. You get a serving of chopped up meat, packed full of smoky delicious flavour, including a generous amount of slightly crispy bark, served with a touch of sour cream and (homemade?) mustard to cut through it. I'll definitely be back for more of this. Oh and I think they serve beer here too. But you probably knew that already.Pricing is extremely reasonable ($20/pax for food will leave you pretty stuffed; beers around $10/pint)

Visited with some friends for the first time last month for some after dinner drinks. We all enjoyed the drinks, and also some very good live music. The most memorable feature though was the payment card, which I didn't like at all. I will spare an explanation as I note that others have described it already, but I just found it quite troublesome. When I go out for friends I just like to relax and part of that is having my drinks served to me. Oddly enough the staff are very helpful in describing both the cumbersome process and beers on offer, so why not just have them go one step further and serve the beers?Anyway, I note other reviewers liked the system, so I guess its a matter of preference, but that's the reason that I wont go back
