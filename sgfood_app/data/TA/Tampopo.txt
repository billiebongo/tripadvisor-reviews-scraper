2 adults and 1 child. We ordered one truffle rice, one deluxe ramen, one mini BP shabu ramen,one nego chilli ton ramen and one salmon crab maki. All are good. See the photos. (The branch at the Takashimaya outlet is slightly better though)
4
Lots of options that suited all levels of experience with Japanese food. The prawn tempura was tasty (though not quite as authentic as hoped) and was a good serving size. Everyone else enjoyed their various katsu curries and left satisfied. Well-priced, enjoyable meal.
4
Tasty and very good sushi but limited offers. Well located close to clark quay. Other orders last like Chinese food possible.
5
Excellent Japanese restaurant next to the Novotel Clarkes Quay.The sashimi, age dash tofu, udon noodles and tempura we tried were all very authentic just as if you were in Japan. Queues form at busy times but I recommend the wait

We're regulars here. Lunches are always good, along with service. Food quality is excellent.Then I come for dinner one night and am disappointed. It almost felt like no manager was around.Staff were not that attentive. Eventually 4 of us finished ordering. Yes, we had many a la carte entrees, so they brought individual plates for us to share the food. But the plates were quite wet. And this is not a hawker or food court stall.I was so disappointed in the wafu steak - lacked the chargrilled flavor. Other dishes were good, especially the black pork dishes. However the black pork bone broth for the ramen, well - perhaps it was the end of the day?We arrived at 7, the place gradually filled up by 8. It would appear they did not have enough staff.Still a good restaurant to our guests, but we were wondering what happens by evening - tired
4
Had lunch on a busy Saturday and the service was surprisingly prompt.The chilled Asahi beer appeared super fast and so did the food. The curry rice was satisfying but the grilled Saba fish was excellent. Not quite happy with the green tea that was served lukewarm in a plastic cup. Overall happy to eat here.
5
This is not a luxurious Japanese restaurant. No star chef, I guess. Not so expensive either.Rather, an everyday lunch place.Iâ€™m a Japanese travelled to Singapore.If I live in Singapore, I can have lunch here everyday.Such a variety of dishes.The quality of Katsudon, fried pork bowl was decent.Goo

SO wanted to eat tonkatsu but we didn't want to travel to our usual hunts. So, we ordered the supreme black big tonkatsu set. Unfortunately, there was nothing supreme about it just average. We didn't quite like the miso soup because it has too much vegetables, making it like a vegetable soup if you know what I mean.The ebi in the deluxe tempura platter were good, huge and fresh. The broth in the chicken ramen was something different but tasty. However, there was only one piece of chashu. We left the restaurant feeling average only after spending more than $70 because we came to eat the tonkatsu primarily but it wasn't up to expectations
4
Went there for lunch on a Saturday, place were packed but not full. There were many discounts going on but after deductions, prices still isn't very cheap. Average meal for a person cost around $20-$30 for a main dish and a drink.The deluxe bento came with a wide variety of food, chawamushi, mini salmon don, tempura and cha soba. Everything was good except for the cha soba which was too dry. We also had the less fat tonkatsu set which was on offer. The pork cutlet is crispy and tender, goes really well with the horseradish. However, some parts of the cutlet is too fatty. One of the must try drink is the ice ume tea! Surprisingly refreshing and addictive! Made up of plum and soda water, weird combination but really good. Total bill of this 3 items came up to around $60.

Came here with my SO for lunch on a weekday. Wasn't too crowded despite being located in mall that is close to many offices. We were seated without having to make any reservations but YMMV. The food menu is quite extensive just like any typical Japanese chain restaurant. We ordered the Salmon Sushi, which was amazing and well balanced. Both of us ordered Ramen and found the broth to be overly salted. Unsure if it's just the ramen dishes. The service staff was attentive and drinks were topped up in a timely manner. Staffers were also courteous and friendly throughout our entire meal. For the price we paid, we couldn't ask for more.
4
Lovely Japanese food, well cooked and presented. Quick service and friendly staff. This restaurant has example plates of the food on plates in the shop window
4
Might not be the most charming place, a basement in a shopping mall, but the curry udon is very good.
4
Great Japanese Restaurant. The food is excellent. Nice and friendly server. Reasonably price. Simply the best for a quick lunch. Service is fast.
5
High quality food! Order the black pig its so tender! The place is very clean and the servers are very accommodating! Its a bit pricey but its worth it!
3
Weekend casual dinner at this iconic Japanese restaurant has become a blatant disappointment!The Tempura is still well-prepared and the deep fried pork set remains as tasty. Yet the cups for water and tea have been downgraded to the use of plastic. The customer service has become less professional and courteous.Only solace: its iconic Japanese soya sauce..
1
I ate with 4 of my friends and we sat by the water with a great view on a Friday night. The food was great...at least what came was. Our drinks didn't even come until we finished our meal and one of our rolls was 30 minutes late. If you come, don't sit near the bar and only eat if you aren't thirsty
5
We have been to tampopo twice for lunch. Tried 2 types of ramen, sashimi, maki rolls, gyoza and cakes. Both times the service was prompt, with servers ready to help with selection. Food was tasty and fresh. Would definitely go here again when I crave Japanese food.
4
A Japanese wudong noddles soup with tofu and seaweed soup at its best at Tampopo's titbits in less formal outlet, if you opt for a more casual family quick food !It is a self-service outlet for trying out a full range of cold ready-cooked authentic Japanese small dishes
5
This place has such a large menu that you worry something will go wrong. I have heard mixed reviews from locals about this particular branch too - food quality can be irregular and waitstaff are either helpful or horrible. I went on a weekday afternoon and my friend and I had ramen, along with a pokÃ© salad. We both loved our food!But what got me was when the Christmas music started playing and my friend said, "Oh god this is way too early!" The manager happened to walk by and he bent down and patted my friend on the shoulder, "And a merry Christmas to you, sir!" We all laughed. It lifted our mood, and I think it helped us enjoy our meal too

Tampopo has been in Singapore for several years. I tried their black pig spicy shabu ramen at this branch at Liang Court. Don't be fooled by the word 'spicy'. At least for me I had to add additional chili oil and flakes to bring up the spiciness. If you are a big meat eater, do add extra topping for the meat. Their menu is wide spread with the usual run of the mill Japanese fare. They are famous for their black pig and Hokkaido style ramen. It is rich and flavorful.
4
Tampopo has been around for years..yet still the place for casual Japanese.
Really good ramen, honest suhis and tempura
Service is pro, but don't expect more we are in Singapore.
Good for familly and quick lunch
3
Food and service was reasonable. A tad pricey for the food and service standard. Can get better food and service for that price. On the whole, a pleasant dining experience, but I won't bother joining a long queue for it.
5
We were during our last Singapore stays in Novotel (just besides), several times in Tampopo. They offer a wide range of delicious food, Asian style and definitely worth a try. Like in many other restaurants in Singapore you might need to queue. Early arrival helps.
4
Great selection of Japanese food at reasonable prices in a large restaurant. The special is the black pig ramen - springy al dente noodles in a mildly spicy soup with generous serving of pork. The salmon sashimi salad was very good too. The yuzu cooler drink was tangy and refreshing.
3
Tampopo japanese Liang Court. I brought my family there for a dinner since my children loves to have Japanese food. The Menu in there are priced at a very reasonable range, I would there more family friendly as they do have kids menu as well. Overall dining experience was good and my children love the food. And they are happy about it.

If you like pork and Japanese ramen, this is the place to dine.We ordered a pork Ramen with extra sliced pork and chillie flakes on the side, a tonkotsu (breaded, fried pork) set and gyoza (pan fried dumplings) to share.The stock in the pork ramen was beautiful - rich with umami, a slight citrusy note and salted just right. We like our food on the blander side, and were very pleased that we didn't have to ask for hot water to water it down to taste. The shiny soy flavoured egg that accompanied the ramen was superb with a firm albumen enclosing a soft Centre. The thinly sliced pork was very tender with more than enough to share.The tonkotsu was a thick slice of sry tender pork. The chef had the fryer at the correct temperature, and the fillet was moist and tender with a crispy crumb coating without any hint of oiliness. The dish cam with a dab of yellow mustard which we mixed to suit individual tastes with the bottled tonkotsu sauce provided at each table. The "set" came with rice, salad, miso soup - which had a couple of slices of pork in it - and watermelon.The gyoza was also very tasty. Obviously freshly made rather than frozen. And the vinegar dip provided was outstanding - we wanted to drink it!We're already planning a return visit. Recommended
4
Really enjoyed the sushi and chirashi. The fish was very fresh, well cut, premium and varied, on top of perfectly cooked and seasonned rice. Comes with a tasty miso soup and the price is fair for the quality. Also sampled some tempuras which were cooked ok, crispy and not too oily.The food came in quickly enough, but the service was approximative, even forgot the soy sauce at one point. They should not put the intern in charge
3
Last month I went to this place for dinner on Friday night. Order 11 kind Chirashi which was just Excellent. It was so sweet and fresh. Katsu Less Fat one was very good as usual. The wasn't so good coz the person who's took care of our zone not so attentive nor friendly. (Monday 4th July) Yesterday, we went again. The black pig Katsu with curry was excellent. My bowl of Deluxe Bara Chirashi wasn't good. Most of fish were little smell and uni was so mushy and smell. All of cake on the menu was sold out too. We end up ordered cube of matcha and Chocolate Ice Cream which both were super yummy. The service was attentive and friendly on the second floor area. ## Best to come to this place on Friday / Saturday ##My guess is that new stock coming in every Wed or Thurs.. By the time after Sunday nothing fresh have left.
4
If you care for simple quality Japanese food and service for a small family dinner, Tampopo @ Liang Court is always the wise option. Try Yasai ( deep fried veggie coated with flour) Tempura and Ramien (noodle) soup and green tea ice cream with red bean paste! Never forget to order the aromatic white rice with grilled eel fillets complete with some miso soup too. It is a must for any gourmet to taste its best Japanese home-made soya sauce
4
Celebrate my granddaughter birthday there, before that I read so much negative review about tampopo wondering why my daughter choose this place.After checking again TripAdvisor review that this company has since improve . (hope so) And it was good, the ramen we all order turn out to be okay not disappointed. Children also order other food in the menu , we also had sake & sushi.We had about 14pax and the waitress took order and serve without a problem.Good meal
3
We took the deluxe chef recommended ramen. It was ok, yes, but lacked emotions. The soup was salty but not tasty and the shabu pork was bland. The price too high. There are better ramen places around.
3
Tried their black pig deluxe shabu ramen like finally! Taste is so so, Service isn't great either... Ramen price is $19.40
5
The black pig tonkatsu is amazing and consistent. The broth is just right to taste, not too overwhelming. The orange jelly dessert is superb. It used to be really crowded but now with more ramen shops popping up, it's easier to get seatings.
4
Our group of 7 went to this place for dinner weeks ago. As we ate too much of Singapore - Chinese food on our family visited trip. We decided to changed to Japanese that night. All of food we ordered turned out perfectly delicious. - Sushi and sashimi were fresh and tasty. - Katsu imported USA pork was very good in terms of taste and quality. - Wagyu Beef cube was very nice. - Stir Fried veggies was quite good. - Dessert was also yummy. The service from Johnathan was stellar. Definitely will be back for more.
4
this place has been so popular since its opening, however the standard dropped after few years. After a good 10 visits in the last one year we feel that it is back to good food, the ramen is really good, not too salty. The menu is large and well balance. The service is friendly and efficient
3
Used to be a vivid visitor of Tampopo ramen but did not visit the restaurant in the recent year. Arrived at Tampopo around 1230pm on a weekday afternoon. There were few customers but service was almost non-existent. The food portion seems to have shrunk as well. There are better places if you want a bowl of ramen.
5
We ordered cold soba, black pork katsu, and wagyu beef. Surprisingly the soba taste very similar with soba that we had in Tokyo. And the other meals also tasted very authentic. Saw many Japanese people eat there, so I guess this restaurant also match with Japanese people's taste. The plus point of this restaurant is they served soba while it's not easy to find soba restaurant in Singapore. Will come back again for sure
5
We were pleasantly surprised at the relatively modest pricing of very good Japanese food served at Tampopo. The gyoza would have to be the best I've ever tasted and the sushi could not have been any fresher. Plate appeal is obviously something the chefs pride themselves on as each dish was beautifully presented.The standout dish was their kurobuta which was tender,moist,full of flavour and cooked to perfection.We found the service to be exceptional with our young Japanese waiter offering untold advice and insights in to the wonderful food on offe

I have always knew this place for its ramen but since I had ramen for lunch, I thought of trying their other sets for dinner. Ordered the original plain layer katsu set. It came with generous portion of mixed grains rice and a bowl of miso soup with chashu bits and vegetables, not your typical version of seaweed and small bits of tofu. The pork was more tender than I expected and still had some bite to it. I preferred this version to those where the whole pork loin is battered and fried as if not done properly, some places near the fats and ends could be too tough to chew and stomach. Tampopo also have fresh seafood, soba, sushi and a wide variety, providing different choices for varied groups. Price wise, the seafood prices are higher than other chain stores but the sets are comparable price. There's quality assured for the price u pay so good to give this a try.
4
Tampopo has for years been our family choice Japanese dinners whenever we shop at the Meidi-ya Supermart at B1 Liang Court Hotel Complex. The outlet is small and always we have to queue up at times for hours. You could opt to have ala carte or small servings on plates to be ordered from your table tops pc and delivered direct to your tables by "rail roads"
3
Went for lunch, had their Deluxe Tampopo Black Pig Shabu Ramen. Used to like their ramen, somehow it did not give me the satisfaction anymore. The soup was not flavourful and rich enough. However, the lava egg was still one of the best.
3
I was here for dinner. I ordered remen with Tonkatsu (I saw many people ordered this menu). I was surprised when my meal came up because it size. Too much for me to eat it all.
5
We came here because we recall the movie of the same name and were keen to introduce our teenage children (who have fairly conservative culinary tastes) to Japanese cuisine. What a revelation! The best Japanese food we've ever had.
4
Extensive menu, value wise for this type of place it was a bit questionable, but the food was very good and it was late at night, not too many options.
Service was very patchy though, so did not return.
4
Sushi, sashimi, chawanmushi or the various don are quite average here; you get much better value for them at Sushi Tei upstairs for not much difference in quality. The ramen is less good than at specialist ramen eateries. But their Kyoto wagyu beef will certainly wag you! Melts in the mouth, so much better than the Australian version widely served in Singapore. Too bad the veggies that come for the sukiyaki ain't very fresh, and there's some MSG in the sauce. Service is pro-active, a rarity these days
4
This is a really llmice little place, I've only had noodles from here but both the Ramon and the Udon were really good, the soup broth was well flavoured and tasty not too salty maybe a tad too much oil but nothing to ruin the meal.Would recommend...I've already been here 3 times in 3 days!
2
We used to come here for lunch on weekends very often, however, service standard had dropped 3 years ago and we stopped coming here since then, decided to give it another try last Friday. To our disappointment, food isn't as nice as before, service is even worse than last time, shall not come here again

Tampopo has always been known for its high quality food. My colleagues and I went to have lunch there and there was a nice surprise about the lunch offer for SG50 - black pig theme meals. The offer is so interesting for diners who are 50 years and above. We ordered special lunch bento Usual Price : S$59++. Promotion price S$32++ / S$29++ for 50 years and above. Bento was beautifully presented, with food more than enough. The deep-fried mentai pork roll was tasty, batter was fresh and crispy. Small size of chirashi was very satisfying with generous portion of mixed fresh tuna, salmon, swordfish and ikura. Every mouthful is delish. Tempura of shredded carrot is crispy, has big crunch. It did not go soggy after a while, but too much of this can feel oily mouth. A slice of teriyaki gindara was in perfect firmness, sweet teriyaki sauce complements the grilled fish.A plate of sashimi consist of ika (cuttlefish), salmon and tuna. Two slices each type is presented with generous amount of wasabi. Another small portion of pickles will whet more appetite. A smooth chawanmushi and miso soup complete this set meal.Finally a dessert of three cubes of matcha ice-cream was served to end the meal. Matcha ice-cream was lightly creamy and covered with the green tea powder to balance the sweetness.This was one of the best bento I tried! Service was fine, if not just slightly above average as we tried to understand the staff's explanation. Did not need to wait too long for the food to arrive.Ambience of the restaurant is clean and comfortable. Should make use of the SG50 promo more often, great food, high quality of food
4
Lunched there friends today and was pleasantly surprised by their SG50 promotion for guest 50 yrs and above. Tgere is 50% discount for selectd meal items! I have not been to Tampopo for many year but its still good. The last time I visited the place was around 8 yrs ago ...when our kids were still small. Wil, visit the place again with grand parents before the SG50 ptomotion ends by Jul
5
There are a few of these resturants about. We tried on in a mall on Orchard Road and one next to the Novotel in Clarke Quay. Both excellent and reminded me of my time in Japan. The places are always busy which says something about the food as well
4
Though not meant to be famous for sashimi, it fared pretty well and I had my cravings satisfied. The black pork tonkatsu fared well too. 2nd try and still as good.
3
I had the spicy ramen with fried pork. The soup was a tad salty and noodles slightly soggy. The fried pork was nice though. I would recommend choosing from the bento sets or friend menu instead of ramen. Ambience and service were pleasant.
3
The soup is way too salty and suspect it's heavily loaded in MSG. Noodles are okay and service is kinda average. The special "Dragon balls" tasted quite..uh.. weird. To each his own i guess. The blackpork was decent.
4
Been to both outlets,one at Liat Court and the other Takashimaya B2.
Best is their ramen ,especially its stock and noodle just perfect.Ramen are price around $13.90-$16.90,reasonable.
Service is good and be prepare to wait abit longer during peak period (7pm-8pm).
2
Our meal was ruined by the horrible manager who came and stood over us with the bill while I was still eating. We had not asked for the bill and there was still at least one hour to closing time. The restaurant was certainly not busy. I was so taken aback that I actually paid the bill. I then complained to the waitress who smiled. I asked to see the manager but he was hiding. I will not go back until the manager has been replaced and the service improved. We had to ask staff to clean the table otherwise they wouldn't have done it
2
I made a big mistake of ordering negitoro-don and sashimi platter at tampopo at Liang court.Negitoro don rice was served steaming hot, cooking the fish in the process. I told the waitress and they just asked me to write feedback to the manager, without even asking for my contact. By end of dinner, no one came to speak to me.The sashimi platter was served at icy cold temperature. For anyone with some experience in Japanese cuisine, you can understand how poor the standard was based on my description.The price is the two items came up to more than $50.. For that quality, I strongly recommend the management to seriously look into the problem. I am sure you will lose customers if quality remains at suc
4
My friend brought us here because this is one of her fave jap Resto. She did not disappoint us. Food was great! Sashimi were really fresh, the unagi bento was excellent! Ramen was rich and delicious. The place is busy like a fast food joint. Wait staff seems like all our trainees, takes forever to call their attention, doesn't seem to know and understand our order and requests. Over all experience was okay because food were fresh and delish
3
My wife and I used to come here very often. We love the black pork loin tonkatsu sets. The standard has definitely dropped, the salad is too hard for consumption. Not just that, the soup is full of degraded onion with black bits. The meat is the highlight but my wife finds her portion not consistent with mine. There is very little bread crumbs for her portion. Worse of all, I always do not get my spoon when they serve the soup for the set. How do I drink? Service level also has dropped, staff is less attentive, though the manager is better and sharper to set an example. Thumbs up for him. For the same price range, I would recommend saboten with free flow of rice and tea
4
My girlfriend and i went on Ramen hunt awhile back. Our favourite is the blackpork from Tampopo. I cant comment on any other food because thats all i eat there. However my Girlfriend's Mom and Brother say they didnt really like it So i guess its personal preference. I'd say try it once ..Its not really expensive or cheap.. so average i guess, about $17 Go to the tampopo at takashimiya.. think the serive there is bette
4
Came here to try the ramen, choosing one Sapporo Miso Ramen and one Kyushu Ramen together with a miso soup and some watermelon juice for our daughter. We were all pretty happy with the quality of the ramen, although only one slice of char siew is a bit stingy. Gyoza was average. Juices were expensive. Overall cost was $45. Will probably be back for more as it's in quite a convenient location
1
Terrible service, epic joke. No small spoon for for chawamushi, no wasabi, ask for service, waiter can just walk away. Food is average. Totally not recommended and one of the worst japanese restaurant ever.
4
Simply love it. Juicy, tender and generous portion of the kurobuta pork culet is a must try. Together with the sour plum sauce, makes the combination deadly and heavenly!
5
Try the potato salad, salmon sashimi, and black pork gyoza. Everything i had there was lovely. No wonder they won so many awards!
4
Excellent deep fried pork cutlets. Much better than the popular pork cutlet chains. Expertise in black pig dishes and seasonal items from Japan. Ramen can go somewhere else. Sashimi is fresh. Wide variety of items for the whole family.
4
I loved the broth of the ramen here. Much better than Ippudo in my opinion. Calpis drink is our fave drink. We had to wait about 10 min on a weekend night but service was decently quick.
5
The restaurant is simple and the food is excellent. Love the Ramen and the Sushi with the perfect green tea served. The service is always good! Everytime I drop Singapore I pass in Tampopo
5
There is free rice refills bowl after bowl and the food there was yummy and cant be found easily in any part of Singapore. What i liked most is the Green Tea ice cream, its absolutely different from outside. When eating it, the shape is unusual; looks like cylinder. Its was superb! Frozen and taste like true green tea leaves . Thus, i recommended this 5-star restaurant to everyone. .. try it 
5
I always visited the one in Taka, and came here whenever I am in singapore, even its only a day stopover.Service was fast and no fuss, polite and kind. Fresh food.I actually just know that they are actually famous for the ramen. I never eat their ramen. But I usually order the grand sashimi, with a big portion of sashimi toro chu toro, order additional a portion of uni and a small bowl of sushi rice, chirashi don cant beat that make your own combination.The shabu shabu was good too, the one with approximately 60dollars promotion (usually 80 something) was nice too.
3
We've always enjoyed a visit to T, a firm favorite with the kids.Today I have to say I am sorely disappointed, as the triple black ramen was bland and the even the old favorite Negi Chilli Ramen was tasteless! What happened after the renovation?? Yikes I am very sad as we have had many a wonderful meal in the past years. Gotta get the old magic back guys.
4
After the first time at Tampopo's, I headed back at least thrice because their Ramen is so good. Cravings made me cave in. Let me share a couple of my favorite dishes there.They have two outlets - Liang Court and Takashimaya. I usually prefer the former outlet even though it's more crowded. I love their Black Pig Ramen series - especially the Shabu Ramen or Deluxe Shabu Ramen. Note that I was, and never am a fan of pork - but black pig tastes so succulent, tender, lean and the flavor comes with hints of sweetness that totally enhances the sensation when eating a bowl of Black Pig Ramen. The soup is tasty, needless to say. The Ramen noodles they use is also different - springy, slim, and somewhat curly.My next favorite item from Tampopo has to be their Wafu Steak - think tender, succulent, chewy and absolutely sumptuous seared beef slices marinated / sprinkled with salt, and melts in the mouth. For more detailed information and photos, please drop by:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/01/dinner-at-tampopo.htm

We had just arrived in Singapore and were looking for easy and quick food. We ended up here just by walking around the hotel.It's an easy choice, nicely located next to Clark quays.For the food, expect something Japanese, with a big choice on the menu.However it stays simple and the food is average. Nothing special, nothing bad, but they are plenty of other options here in Singapore
3
Was with 2 friends and recommended Tampopo @Clarke Quay for our dinner. Remembered that it was popular because it served decent jap food. Kind of regretted to have suggested that place.The sushi rice was soft, not that I remembered the sushi rice should be. Checked with my friends if they felt the same or was it my own preference that misjudged the quality. They agreed that it was way too soft. Told one of the staff and he came back with 'checked with the chef and he tried the batch of rice but there's nothing wrong'. He then advised that we should put it down into the comment card. So we have left with no choice but to eat the sushi but leave all the rice on the plate.I would be very worried if the rice is of such standard, don't think I would risk ordering them again.
3
Decided to try out Tampopo after seeing online reviews raving about its ramen. Ate at the Takashimaya outlet and tried it's chashu ramen. Wouldn't say it's one of the best ramens I've ever tasted but it was above average, only issue I had with it is its oily soup base. The strawberry shortcake I ordered as a dessert was good though, it dissolved the oily aftertaste in my mouth. Nice for a decent meal but there're many other better ramen restaurants in Singapore

I wish to feedback and complain on with regards to the gambling, chasing and intimidation of us, your patrons out of Tampopo on 7th August 2013.I brought my overseas friend, Faye to Tampopo because she loves Japanese food and since I had pretty alright experience with your restaurant, I brought her there ti celebrate her birthday. We came about 9pm and ordered quite a bit of food. At 10pm, they turned off the air-con. At 10.10pm I went to the gent's. Your closing time is 10.30pm.A short while later, I came back to the restaurant only to find that the shutters had been pulled down and my friend standing outside the restaurant crying. I was shocked to hear what had happened to make Faye so upset.When I left the restaurant for the gent's, Faye heard about 4-5 servers talking very loudly amongst themselves, pointing and remarking at our table as to why my friend was still there, that it was very late and everyone wanted to go home early. One of the Chinese male staff called Lin Cheong, started a bet with his peers that if he went over to ask her to leave and succeeded, he will be winning $5 dollars each from the servers. His peers agreed and he went over to my friend and told her to leave as the restaurant has already closed.My friend told him that she has not finished the food and asked if he could give her some time. Lin shrugged his shoulders and said no and that she has to leave immediately and that she is holding the staff back from going home. Obviously feeling uncomfortable and upset but still having much food left, she asked if she could have the food packed before leaving, to which Lin assumed a very aggressive tone and body posture and said he will be calling the security guards if she does not leave immediately.Feeling intimidated, insulted, disgusted and being in a foreign land, she left the restaurant while Lin went over to his peers to collect his S$5 betting reward.After hearing what Faye experienced, I went over to knock on the shutters. Lin came over and asked what I wanted. I told him of what happened, wanted an explanation and manager's contact. Lin's eyes was very red and looked as if he was on drugs. I would know because I used to serve in the police during my national service. Lin told me to go Facebook, never apologized and said that what he did was just a joke and that I should go away. I told him I wanted to see the manager which he mentioned has already gone home and refused to give me the contact. He started to talk very aggressively to me and at one point looked like he wanted to pull up the shutters and to come out and beat me until his peers stopped him. Finally he passed me the contact of the manager, David, 93229942 and I left.Faye and I are very appalled at what happened and I am very upset that the staff on shift has made her cry at the expense of their own pleasure and for a cheap $5 bet.There are many tactful ways to "chase a customer" out of the establishment although I did not think we were being too much for even asking for the food to be packed.I am writing this, to seek an explanation as to how this is possible and if their service staff was sufficiently trained as well as warn others of your atrocious service. I would like a refund of service charges as well as the large portion of unfinished food that I had left at your restaurant. Please check your CCTV if you have doubts as to the authenticity of my story and you will see the exchange of cash between your servers during that time. How is it that your staff can be holding money during operation hours?I have tried to contact the manager's number but have not received a reply

We had the Super Delux Box and the Steak Box which were both perfectly acceptable. The salmon sashimi in the box seemed fresh, the steak was nicely grilled and tender, the soup was just right.Service was fast and friendly. They refilled our teas continously throughout the meal

When in Singapore I try to visit this restaurant for its crab ramen, which is really lovely. The last time I visited Tampopo it was sold out already. This was the most disappointing moment in life. Most recently they have added the deep fried oysters too. These are really irresistible, one of the most yummy dishes thinkable. Therefore it is not on the food side so much but it is more in the dull, Singaporean arrogance, that spoils the fun in this restaurant. As well as bad management, bringing food to teh wrong table and waiting too long. Apart from that please try the Crab Ramen and the deep fried oyster

This is my first time eating in Tampopo, Liang Court and it will be my LAST time as well. Food was bad and poor quality. We ordered the bento box, ramen and some egg/shrimp stuff. We didnt finish it. It was horrible. Expensive as well, considering the poor quality.I strongly do not recommend this place at all

I was at the Ngee Ann City 4th floor branch. I was there for dinner with my partner. I ordered a Sukiyaki set for myself and upon it's arrival in front me, I was disappointed. I know Tampopo is an upmarket eatery and my partner is in the restaurant business too and we know what to expect from a $40 sukiyaki set. I was given just a slice of beef. Yes, 1 miserable slice of beef. For $40 l, I could probably eat a cow at Sho Teppan and had a better dining experience. I was this close to walking off but girl was starving and pissed. The manager came over and was very polite and nice when I asked him if I ordered a tofu salad soup or sukiyaki. He promptly accomodated me and brought it back to the kitchen an returned with an additional slice of beef. Hooray! I had 2 slices of beef.(Sarcasm)In total honesty, the soup was rubbish. Everything was rubbish for a $40 set. I had better Japanese food elsewhere.The only thing that made it better was the manager, who was very accommodating and polite.I will never ever go back again and would advise others not to

Arguably the best place for ramen! Be spoilt for choice with the wide selection - thick chewy Hokkaido ramen, thin hard Kyushu ramen, Shabu ramen, Wakame soba and the list literally goes on and on. The deep fried gyoza is recommended - deliciously crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Goes well with the ramen

What a joke for a Japanese Restrauant the quality of the meal was very poor and not like we have in Australia. It is very over priced and has no service.My wife had food on her plate and the fork in her mouth when the wait girl tried to take the plate away.We think they wanted the table for other people..Never again.

I had the black pig ramen as that's what they are famous for... Was great and had lots of meat too.
They were also able to make a special vegetarian fried noodles for the vegetarian in our group; was pretty good too

Another good ramen.. Must try! Very authentic Japanese ramen, even their menu also read from right to left...

There's only one thing to get in this place. Cream puff cream puff cream puff cream puff cream puff cream puff. Oh, the strawberry shortcake is nice too. But still, cream puff cream puff cream puff cream puff.

Food is hit/miss but they offer rather interesting menu choices. The soft cold Tofu is great and they make good ramen. Other items are just ordinary but it's a nice family style restaurant to go with friends and family for a relatively inexpensive meal.

I had always enjoyed having meals in this restaurant. There is a good range of food choices and the quality of food is good. I usually take the black pig pork ramen and this time I decided to try the seafood ramen.It is surprisingly tasty despite the fact that it looks very simple. The clear soup though looking really clear really burst with flavour of seafood. The seafood in the ramen is very fresh and the noodle is springy.I will come back again

I was hungry and craving for sashimi and saw the place as a perfectly nice quiet restaurant to fill up while in Clarke Quay. They have and excellent selection on the menu. I was almost tempted to by the black pig items but my craving took over and I ordered the Tuna tataki sashimi and a bowl of beef udon. The tuna sashimi one of the best I had but it cost me more than my bowl of udon. It's a nice casual atmosphere which I would recommend to anyone if it is within his budget. I plan to have the black pig tonkatsu on my next visit!

Came here for lunch. We ordered ramen, a set lunch and several types of sushi. The portion size was good but the food was not as tasty and well presented as other Japanese restaurants we patronized. Service was so so as we have to hail the waitress several times to refill our empty tea cup.

This is a great family Japanese restaurant serving up a mind-boggling array of food. The menu is so huge, it comes in two or three separate portions and if you get lucky, it might be black pig season and you can try all sorts of dishes prepared with the delicacy. It serves all kinds of food, ranging from tonkotsu ramen (most delicious) to sushi and sashimi and bento sets. And all the food is done well. No complaints there. Service is good too

You will not disappoint with their signature black pig ramen. The broth is rich and full of collagen. Can get crowded. Service is good. However it is not a place to chit chat after your bowl of ramen, it can be quite noisy. Their sushi, sashimi, tempura is so-so. Go for the ramen if you are there

Wow. That was the word I uttered the moment I opened the menu. By far, this was one of the most expensive Japanese restaurants I had ever been. Maybe it is because most of their clientele are Japanese expatriates, so the restaurant can easily charge an arm & a leg since they know their customers have loads of cash to spare with all that money they are earning from Japanese companies. I ordered a crab meat porridge & the amount was of crab meat served was pathetically small. The amount of porridge served in that small bowl was well, small. I think Ichiban Boshi & the like charge a much more wallet-friendly price & good quality Japanese food too. Will I ever go to Tampopo again? Heck, no

Definately an enjoyable experience, with so much to choose from! Located in the Liang Court Shopping Centre with an extensive menu choice a place I recommend you try if looking for value for money.

great restaurant located in Liang court shopping center. my favorite would be the spicy miso ramen, pork ramen, and the sashimi salad.

The noodles in pork stock are delicious. Try the black pig ramen, one of the best ramen there. Soup base is delicious and pork is tender and thinly sliced.

Pros
(1) Delicious black pig tonkatsu. Tasty with the right amount of fat.
(2) Food comes out fast.
(3) Noodles are good too
Cons
(1) 3 different menus. Gets rather confusing.

the smell of fried oil lingers in your hair and clothes after you dine in... otherwise the food is great.

The Tampopo I have always visited is at Takashimaya. Exact location..... Let's just say it is near to Crystal jade, Angus house, tonkichi. With so many good and famous food outlets in the vicinity, you will be spoilt for choice. I always go during the lunch hour. The lunch set is cheap and good. Dinner is a wee bit too expensive for me. The service is good too. I remember once I dropped a chopstick, before I even look up, a new pair was presented to me.I do not eat the sashimi outside Japan. I have tried once, it tasted funny. Maybe it's our hot weather here, it just did not taste right. But the sashimi served at Tampopo is good, I have even converted my sister who used to be a die hard fan of a certain "authentic" Japanese restaurant in Katong.For me to write a raving review about food in Singapore, even just a normal review, the food has to be good, price reasonable and great service.This fantastic place offers just the above mentioned. So what are you waiting for

We spent about 10 minutes before ordering because the variety of Japanese food was just so wide....including the good quality black pork, the O Toro sashimi, and katsu don. We just could not decide because they all looked so good.In the end, we settled for toufu and saba fish set (that came with black pork) and the katsu don (which came with a well prepared soup). We finished every morsel and were not disappointed.Prices were reasonable (in the S$12 to S$30 range for one person). Service was also commendable with regular refills of tea.Great casual Japanese dining restaurant. Suitable for any type of meal whether family, couples or non-formal business meal

My favorite jap restaurant in sg. Famous for black pork shabu ramen. I prefer the sashimi, pay a bit more to get the hon toro or chu toro.Fresh and nice taste. After meal, u can go to have a cup of g7 Vietnam coffee at upper level to complete the experienc

We stayed at the Novotel Clarke Quay and happen to come across a line going into Tampopo. I figured the kids will miss Japanese cuisine, since we are on our way to Vietnam . The kids and my husband ordered the ramen and I the cold noodles. The kids and hubby loved their ramen and gulped it up with out stopping to breathe. The cold noodles was refreshing and came close to topping what I had in Osaka.Cost is comparable to a bowl of ramen in Sydney

Original Shabu Ramen with Kurobuta, which is the top 10 in lifestyle mag as seen on menu. Again it's not my type of ramen. Still preferred soupbase from ajisan or beppu. Kurobuta, well I do not know how to appreciate them in soup... Taste just, normal pork to me. As seen on Chef For Hire this week, the baked Kurobuta seems so much nicer, and very crispy too!!! :DI had the crab porridge which is very well tasted. The smell of the crab and egg are just blended well into the porridge. Nice!My friend had salmon fried rice which to her is a disappointment, as from she describe, it's kinda lack in taste... I tasted it, it seems alright to me though. Maybe due to me picking a small mouthful but lot of salmon in it.Side dish, salmon skins was kinda small portion for it's value. I find it better if it could be fried for a little longer for more crispiness.For dessert, I had Milk Tea Pudding which I find it good. Sweetness is in the pudding and not in the milk on it. A pity for my friend who had the custard pudding, the caramel is just cause too much sweetness in it, not so nice yea. Orange jelly, good, but doesn't worth the value, as I guess I know the recipe to it...Queued for 25 minutes before entering the restaurant for dinner. Nice staffs in the restaurant who welcomed us warmly (can felt the sincerity there)
