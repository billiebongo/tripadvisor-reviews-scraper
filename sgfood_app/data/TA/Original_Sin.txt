The Bosco Misto was the highlight of the night! Really flavourful and delicious with a nice texture that is sure to suit the palate of many. The pizzas and pastas were good too. Worth it with the Entertainer App!
5
Lovely setting/fast service-the hummus is so finger licking.I ate most of the hummus then the food!
Must visit place when in Singapore
4
The food was really good.Our choice was nut cutlet which was crisp outside and soft inside. He egg plant preparation, the pizza were also very good. The place in Hlland Village is so crowded u need reservation
5
their 4 cheese pizza here is really good, in my 4-5 times here i've always ordered that as staple, along with other nice mains/sides. its a vegetarian place, mainly pizzas and pastas.
5
Varied menu that kept the vegan members of our party happy. The sharing platters were great and we all enjoyed delicious pizzas. Definitely our favourite meal of the trip!
3
Had the moussaka and lentil soup - was disappointed as I have had tastier food in the past . The service is friendly and good. Pricing is aggressive.
2
No taste , no quality , no originality in food. Friendly people , good ambiance. What a pity to pay this price for such quality product. Better try other veggie restaurant.
4
I was only in SGP for 3 days and went here twice. We had the corn fritters (massive portion), the dukkah (twice), the antipasti, the tandoori veg and the broccoli pesto and a lava cake. It was all good. There is the option to turn many of the dishes into vegan dishes. The service was friendly and timely. The wine list was short but perfectly fine. The have decent wines by the glass.Inside has quite fierce air con, which they said couldn't be adjusted so we moved tables. Outside, if the weather's good, is very pleasant indeed
3
This place is in the other half of Holland V and their food menu was good with Mezzes and pasta and all. I just hope there was a better explanation of some foods, especially the dukkhas and stuff on the menu. The food tasted good but the dessert was a disappointment
5
Was a bit worried due to a few recent reviews that are not as good. But decided to give it a go anyway. Very glad that we did.We went on a weekday night so the place is nice and quiet.We ordered Bosco Misto ( fabulous), Lasagna ( good) and Tiramisu which rounded off our meal nicely.Service was good, proactive and attentive.Cannot wait to be back and try other food
5
A vegetarian menu with heaps of stunning dishes from around the Mediterranean.
We pizza, pasta and rissotto. Cocktail and red wine. Everything was delicious.
Look forward to going again next time I'm in Singapore.
5
3rd time here, and the pizza and pasta are consistently amazing. ordered the 4 cheese pizza, and the penne pasta this time around, was awesome. service was also prompt and polite, in our 3 times here. would come back again.
3
Food is fantastic, its just that they are always in hurry to clear the table even if we haven't finished yet....
4
Great vegetarian, can recommend the moussaka and spanakopita mains, and mezze plate starter. I was nervous about seed allergies, but no problems here. Attentive service, decent menu choice. Will be back.
4
This is a great place for middle eastern vegetarian food. Little pricey most mains about 30 sgd but worth the price. Innovative menu with lots of choices. They have a great wine menu with outdoor seating.
5
You know the feeling you get when you just finished a full vegetarian meal and you don't feel quite satisfied? NOT AT ORIGINAL SINS!! Guaranteed satiety, the way their food is prepared. This place feed you properly and the vegetarian dishes are wholesome and flavored with so much punch that I won't even realize that I am going vegetarian. Eat here. You will not leave, feeling like there was something missing in your meal. Recommend dish: portobello mushroom starter with grilled cheese! So very Instagramable too!!!The Celeriac salad is so fresh and crunchy you will wanna ask for more! But then there are other dishes to try too. Conundrum .....We ordered pizza! All of them freshly made with thin crust. Taste heavenly but not as sinful as it looks !!!! Vegan options available upon request. Highly recommended and remember to call in for advance reservations especially on weekends. We are back here again and again and again ...
5
Great mediterranean vegetarian restaurant. Some gluten free options too and servers are quite knowledgable about allergies. Portion sizes are a little on the small side, and I'd love to see additional gluten free options and GF bread options added to the menu. Service can be a little slow and it's a bit on the pricey side, but the food alone warrants a 5 out of 5 rating for me.
3
The restaurant was our choice because we had a vegan friend in town. None of us were impressed. The mezze platter was very basic and tasteless. Pita bread was warm. The olives are delicious, very well seasoned but small portion. The celeriac salad was good. The moussaka was a version with lentils and potatos, just one layer of eggplant and I only know there is a bechamel sauce because it's written on the menu, but it's rather dry. It tastes more like a Tex-Mex dish than a Greek one. One of my friends ordered the Spanakopita and it was delicious. For dessert we ordered the apple crumble and it's overpowered by cinnamon, we could not taste the apples at all. Service was good, our waiter was very nice. We did not have to wait much for our food. Overall it's not much of a bad experience but there are lots of new, interesting and creative healthy/vegetarian restaurants in Singapore now that's not worth anymore to go to Original Sin
5
The occasion was a staff dinner. The event was a great success and this was partly due to the excellent customer service. The orders were taken efficiently with no mistakes made. There were quite long gaps between dishes but none if us minded as we were all so busy having fun together. I had vegan options which were tasty and well prepared. Everyone seemed to enjoy their choices. An enjoyable meal and we were able to relax as we were being well looked after.
3
Well spaced out tables and good customer service. Food was slightly above average. I remembered the standard of food was higher since my last visit about a year ago. Nonetheless, we enjoyed our meal. Portions are big, such that a main dish is enough for two persons to share. For weekend patronage, reservations should be made as it was full house when we went for Sunday lunch
1
Service was absolutely horrible - waiter keeps bugging, doesn't let us eat properly, they're not coordinated with the dishes and the food is regular at most.
Aside from that, my wife has allergies to dairy and nobody remembered that and brought cheese in her dish.
5
A final return to Singapore and 'Original Sin' HAD to be a visit.Dined with fellow vegetarian friends, and aside from a couple of minor set-backs (two power outs, inexperienced servers) we had another great visit & meal.Though it would be nice to see chef change up her (still Marisa?) menu a little more, they always have various specials on offer. Excellent wine list, the Bosco Misto still incredible, and four happy diners...again.Keep waving the 'veggie flag' Original Sin. The world - and more proximally, Singapore's food scene - needs you
5
We have been eating off and on at Original Sin for the past 10 years. The menu has not varied much, which is good and allows consistency of quality. This is a Continental vegetarian restaurant. Food is tasty and wines are very good. Desserts too are tempting enough to make one breakdown and go for the extra bit of calories. Last evening we ordered the baked camembert with green apples, and a mezzo platter (Greek appetisers) for starters, and the Bosco Misto (delicious) and Moussaka (very good) as mains. We shared an apple crumble with vanilla ice cream for dessert. We also had a bottle of very good wine, the Clare Valley Shiraz. The bill came to $240, which is a bit on the expensive side. Service was very good. On previous occasions this has been a bit hit or miss. However last evening the staff seemed more engaged and at ease with what they were doing, a sign of good management culture of treating staff well. One suggestion: try serving cranberry sauce with the camembert. Would round off the flavour nicely.
4
Tucked away in a leafy suburban street, Original Sin is obviously popular because 10minutes after we arrived the restaurant was full. We shared a delicious mezze platter with falafel, humous, pitta and dips, alongside truffle fries and pizza. Portions are delicious and generous, and we couldn't finish the pizza . Would definitely return and next time will save space to sample the deserts. Head there early if you don't have a reservation
5
This place is a true delight for both vegetarians and 'non'. They have a varied menu, including pastas, salads, tapas, to more unique home-spun ideas like my favourite: Bosco Misto. They are also willing to adapt menu items depending on your preference or dietary needs.A fine wine list compliments the food, service is fine, and it's on the fringe of Holland Village, so easy to get to via taxi/train/bus.Visit Original Sin if you're after Singapore's only upscale veg. menu and a truly fine meal
4
Having been walking past this restaurant for 10 years, never gave it a thought, but gave up meat for Lent so been looking for different options. The experience was totally unexpected...amazing menu, and the food was superb...pommodoro and burrata (evening special) to start, followed by the moussaka (shared), and bottle of Chardonnay. All in about $S180. Lovely spot, definitely going back
4
I was here about ten years ago. The restaurant stays on the same ground....Classy vegetarian with Italian, Mediterranean fusion cuisine.Good flavor but don't expect vegetarian food to be cheap anymore. Well, like I said in many previous posts, Singapore is an expensive city....Nice ambiance and staff accommodating us to a nicer table. Attentive. Since it's a treat from a friend, I dont know the exact cost. Please Google 
4
The food here is outstanding. It's not a typical high class restaurant from its look, but seriously the food is worth to try. Food presentable is almost par as fine dining (perhaps for some menu, not all). It doesn't come with a low price tag. Visit in the evening to have a romantic ambience. Best vegetarian restaurant so far. Will come again to try other menu
5
I took a vegetarian friend here for dinner. I love my meat, so I was a bit apprehensive but I was so impressed - I thoroughly enjoyed my pasta meal. A bit pricey but worth it and definitely would go back (if I am with a vegetarian)
4
The food is good but it is a bit expensive. Perhaps that's what they called fine dining. We tried their set lunch. I would not recommended the wrap. However the veggie burger was good. Service was excellent. Need not booking if you go on weekdays, abundant of seat. Except min spending of 30 dollar per pax.
4
We visited for lunch after quite a while... The ambience & quality continues to hold even after nearly a decade. Staff are efficient and the menu keeps evolving. Bosco Mosto is their evergreen flagship dish... Has become a bit pricier in recent times !!
4
The ambience was very nice!!!!!!! The waiters were friendly and food was truly AMAZING. There was a cheese overload though. The price was quite high as well.
4
Like the food here. However, it is very expensive, probably the most expensive veg place in Singapore. One main dishes is at least S$30 - $40.
5
Really yummy food, shared a couple of plates including salad with pumpkin/avocado, burrata and bruschetta. Great and attentive service. It has a really lovely atmosphere. Sat outside under an awning - really lovely vibe. Perfect place for a special occassion - I'd like to come back for my birthday
4
This a great restaurant for vegetarians and vegans. The food is very very good. All be it a little expensive. A must have desert is the chocolate brownies with vegan brown rice ice cream. This place is a bit out of the city centre but easy to get to on the train system.
5
We loved this resturant. Not often we eat dessert, but after the great mains, we couldn't resist. Top marks for the brownie and vegan brown rice ice cream.The vegans in our group were very impressed and us non-vegans had a great feed too.And if your in the CBD do yourself a favour and jump on the train and get out to this beautiful part of Singapore. You won't regret it.We'll be bac
4
Located in the heart of Holland Village, right next to the MRT.Enjoy going there every time since it is at a peaceful location (unlike Downtown) and has unique food options for a vegetarian lik myself.You might find it a bit over priced if you are looking for a decent, economic meal.Go there on a special occasion and take a stroll along the street... if you have time at hand...the surroundings have good bakery's and boutiques
3
Went there for dinner with a work collegue on a week night. The positives: The ambience is really nice with very nice interior design. There is lovely seating outside away from the main road. The service is prompt and friendly. They have a very large selection of dishes. As a European/Australian the collection is a bit strange as there is a mix of Italian, Greek and Middle eastern dishes but on the other hand that is also what makes the place quite original. There is a very good selection of quality wines, mainly from Australia and New Zealand. We had a NZ Pinot Noir which was served at the right temperature and was very enjoyable.We ordered a mix platter (mezze) for entree which has very good turkish bread with 3 dips and some falafel. Very tasty and freshly prepared. For the main we had the gnochhi special and a pizza. The gnocchi were very good but the pizza was average. The dough is not really proper pizza dough. For desert we enjoyed the Cheese cake which wasa bit dry but had excellent flavor and was not too sweet. The not so good:The restaurant is quite pricey even by Singapore standards. A main dish is $30 and given that this is a vegetarian place that is quite a lot
3
We went to original sin with family for lunch last Sunday and were quite disappointed. I don't mind paying if the food quality is exceptional, especially since I am a vegetarian. However, the food was normal average fare with no real flavor of spices. Keeping that in mind, it felt that you were paying top $ for food which was quite average and nothing spectacular. Further, over the years, the restaurant has not really changed things around much. I think it does need a bit of change to get the zing back. Overall, Unsatisfied.
2
Services was good and the place is ok, nice for a dinner after work but nothing really special. Although the food was alright the portions are very poor and quality average, they use too much cheese in every dish. Perhaps because I am coming from the Mediterranean I do not think the food is quality and prices certainly seem exorbitant, they skills "putting one over on you" are commendable
3
Fairly ordinary meal in fairly ordinary surrounding with fairly ordinary service. Shared a mezze platter which was generally OK but the falafel, if that is what it was, was very dry. Filo parcel with cheese and spinach was unspectacular and the filing lacked seasoning.
4
Small usually quiet restaurant good for casual evening meal. Good selection on menu especially for vegans.
Prices are reasonable. Booking is advised during weekends.
4
We are regulars here... given their wide variety of veggie mediterranean fare. Their mezze platter is also really nice. Their indoor seating gets full pretty quickly on weekends. Prices have gone up steeply in the recent months - so the value is coming down !!
3
A well established restaurant in Singapore. Food quality is a bit variable : outstanding for a few dishes and mediocre for others. A small restaurant so book in advance, with big prices!
4
Great food, really tasty and a good set of options. Been here a number of times and tried many of their dishes - all great. However be prepared to pay as it's quite pricey and service is generally ok but nothing to shout about.
4
Have known Original Sin for over a decade and the food never disappoint. Favorite will be the Magic Mushroom, my all time favorite. Although the portion could have been a lil bigger.
2
3 courses dinner for two at 180$ with one glass of alcohol each.As per other review, the service isn't fantastic but to be very honest it is quite similar to many other restaurants in Singapore : they only adress the male at the table,they want to remove your plate while you are obviously still eating, etc. The service was very fast dépité the restaurant being full. The best part of our meal was the desert. Overall the food is well presented, the mousaka didn't taste good. There were drop of spice on it but the mousaka itself was dull and plain. The brushes take was heavy. The hazelnut cake was nicely presented and the taste was just nice.location is in a quiet lane . Great for outdoor meals
5
Definitely one of the best vegetarian I've been to. Good ambience with public parking lots nearby. Good location near holland village. Service is good and the food is quite amazing. "Magic mushroom" is a must try in my opinion! Price is on the high side but the quality of the ingredients used is commensurate with it
5
This was our last meal stop after 2 weeks in Singapore & Vietnam. We've had some great veggie food at a range of prices and whilst this place in chic Holland Village isn't cheap the food Italian influenced menu is fantastic. We went on a Saturday lunchtime and had the "free flow" set lunch - a choice from 3 starters, 3 main courses and 2 desserts with unlimited top ups of house wine (red, white or Prosecco).
5
No words for the food that was served here.A must go place for all vegetarians. Lip smacking taste. Very classy presentation.Slightly expensive but should try at least once to get the feel of it. Vegetarians please make it a point to go and eat there. Service thumbs up too.....Never tasted anything like this before...Never knew my Indian veggie tongue would love it so much..
4
Great place to eat if you crave for vegetarian food with a twist. I loved the burrata and the pomelo salad was crisp with interesting flavors. The place is slightly expensive but you do enjoy the ambience and palate experience.
4
Food was very good. Table for a family size of 4 was very congested. Considering that the food is vegetarian the food rates I felt was on a higher side
3
The setting is lovely and the staff are attentive but all dishes arrived and lacked basic seasoning. I can't believe that the chef actually tastes anything that he cooks. They clearly use good quality ingredients but the lack of seasoning really lets it down
5
Great place to meet - bright and airy. Food had a good range with pizza , great salads, cheese etc. Service was good. Would come here again
5
I have been there a few time during my trips to Singapore. The food is consistent and the menu changes just enough. The best part it is all vegetarian.
4
We have been there with a small group of friends. This place is a good option for vegetarians in the city. It is a bit pricey but we knew that when we planned. It is a good place to have Good conversations over good Mediterranian food. Their starters are a must try
4
The vegetable tandoori was delicious - especially with the mango chutney and the tzatziki chutney. Pizza was full of flavours, I love the crispy dough edges... Yum yum ! The pomelo salad was a let-down. I've had better pomelo salad at Thai restaurants.The service was very good though. I highly recommend to visit Original Si
5
My wife and I, vegetarians for the last six years ago, rate Original Sin as the tops for a special occasion, lunch or dinner. The Mediterranean and Italian dishes are consistently excellent and we always start a family meal with the humus platter. We have been lucky enough to indulge in vegetarian meals on all continents - including Antarctica (on a ship!) - and none are better than OS. I usually go for the baked dishes, my wife has salads plus and always has the cheesecake. The last family meal there (4 adults and two boisterous boys aged 7 & 5) came to about $S150. This was with a starter but no wine. As with most Singapore restaurants wine is quite expensive so we raise a glass at home after! When the occasion is not that special we make do with the 3 course set menu, very good value at just under $S30, OS is set a little apart from Holland Village in a trendy small enclave; we are always tempted by nearby coffee shops for something after. Both ambiance and cuisine are really enjoyable
1
5 of us went for lunch. Had 2 set meals. Soup was flavourless and overcooked. Spaghetti pretty bland. Ala carte items- mezza platter low in taste, pizza was soggy, crumble was burnt. Pineapple juice was from a carton. Only passable item was the portobello mushroom.In all an epic fail 2/1
4
We had read and heard many good things about this restaurant before visiting. And it was true in every aspect!The service was fast and friendly, food was really tasty. For a vegetarians like us this was like finding a hidden treasure.It is tad on an expensive side though. 3 course Dinner for two with wine is around SGD 100 per head.
2
Menu seems more limited and prices high. Used to be one of my favourites but will think twice before I pay $80 for 2 people for lunch. Canneloni was stodgy and no side salad for $30!
3
As my friend is a vegetarian, they have a great selection in the menu. Ambience was great and bear in mind to make a reservation on a weekends. Little pricy though..
3
We had Dinner at this Restaurant. The welcoming and service was pretty bad. The food was ok but like the title said nothing special. The prices are to high for the quality. We probably don't go back there.
2
Food read nice on the menu, no follow through to the food...service intent was definitely there, execution left something to be desired
4
I went there couple of times when I was in Singapore. It is a nice place to be with your family and friends for lunch and dinner. This restaurant serves great vegetarian food and the service is good. I love their Moussaka dish and chocolate brownie for dessert
4
Brought my mum there for a birthday lunch. The last time we were there was more than 10 yrs ago. Mum liked it a lot back then so I thought it would be good to go again. To my surprise, the quality of food was still as good. Both of us were really stuffed from the meal. The Tiramisu cake given to us for the birthday celebration was also of quite a generous portion
4
Good staff and service. Food is excellent but seems a bit expensive for the quantity. There seems to be nothing special about this place that seems to justify the cost. Would've expected a better ambiance or service to go with the high cost. Excellent vegetarian options and presentation style
4
The ambience and the service was very good especially when we require the cake to be kept away then brought out and afterwards to be packed away. All done with a smile on the servers' faces. Been there before though has been a while since the last visit and will definitely be going back there again
4
Located in Holland Village this restaurant seems to be popular choice. Food is good but nothing out of world. I was impressed when waiteress asked about food allergy and preferences like No dairy etc. Service was efficient. We tried Mezze platter with breads, some sides and a cheese based main course. Food was fresh.Food portion size is little bit less and prices more expensive
5
Large portions, elaborately prepared dishes. Flavourful. Be careful not to order too many cheese dishes as it may be too heavy. In general, it is a little pricy, probably because of the location and the complexity of the dishesI ordered:SpanakopitaBosco MistoStrozza PretiVegan Chocolate Brownie with Brown rice ice cream (this was average. Brownie was dry, ice cream will not be creamy enough for you if you eat milk ice cream normally
4
We enjoy all the dishes on the menu. But the Mediterranean platter is a Favourite. Stuffed bell pepper with quinoa is also a preferred dish. Even though it is a vegetarian restaurant, would definitely recommend all to try it.
3
Lots of varieties but considering its vegetarian, pricing is very steep! Price will be the main deterrent to go back again.
5
Food is amazing. Service is excellent. Ambience is nice. Location is perfect. Even the kids enjoyed it.
5
Unbelievable! Entire menu is veg!!
Unbelievable! It was packed on a Wednesday lunch time!!
Satisfied with food as well as service. Will return back, will bring guests too!
5
Original Sin in Holland Village,Singapore is a lovely place for good vegetarian Mediterranean food. It has both indoors and outdoors seating. We had opted for the outdoors seating since the weather was not bad and fans were also there.The only drawback to this was that since it was on the pavement, the aisle was used by general passerbys also. But,the food was excellent. We had the 'supremo pizza'which was full of succulent cherry tomatoes and artichokes with a thin crust and it was delicious. The 'lasagna rossa' too was very good. Although pretty steeply priced, the food is very good and thoroughly enjoyable
2
This place used to be good... Having been a regular visitor for more than 10 years it feels sad to see the food deteriorate. Our recent experience was very bad in terms of not only the food (salad was not cleaned and brownies were stale) but the lack of innovation in menu is now showing.
5
Though this was my second visit after 7 years, i am very happy to find that the food was consistently delicious as I had remembered. My mum and sis who are healthy nuts really liked every dish, from the mezze platter to beetroot salad to bosco misto(tofu patty)! The only letdown was the tiramisu dessert, though definitely strong in liquor but not cloyingly sweet, cos it's a tad expensive at S$12. Service was definitely attentive on a busy Sunday afternoon. We are already planning a return trip soon to try their thin crust pizzas
3
After reading a lot of reviews we decided to give Original Sin a try, so I reached there around 6pm last evening without a reservation, was able to get a table. Food was quite good, the falafel in the Mezze platter was outstanding, we also loved the Absolut Pasta, which had a very unique flavour. The mousaka was not bad either.The strange part was the service, which was overall fine, but puzzled me a bit in the beginning. I reached there and asked for a table for 2 (without reservation) and two gentlemen (also without reservation) did the same almost along with me. This is alfresco dining and had one beautiful corner table, which the waiter showed me towards as i was just about to park myself there, another waiter came rushing and moved me to the next smaller table which was on the inner-side, more than anything else I was surprised at this. Not sure what the reason was - racism, sexism, simple stereotyping... or some bizzare reason which is beyond my small wits. Next 7-8min I waited while the waiter picked up all the menu cards and promo material from my table and extended it to the gentlemen. Eventually, I got the menu and we enjoyed the meal so I guess it was worth it. Though this little incident was completely avoidable, given that this is a fine dining restaurant and we are paying a steep price, the experience could have been better
5
I am the kind of guy that requires meat.That said, I truly enjoyed the food at original sin. Food was great and place is nice.Portion wise, I would have preferred it to be a little bigger.Good place for gatherings and trying out new stuff for people like me, the meat lovers
5
We both went for the $89++ dinner set menu with free flow prosecco/white wine/red wine.Starters of corn fritters and halloumi were both excellent, mains of ricotta and vodka pasta were even better! Chocolate lava cake with ice cream desert topped off what was a fantastic evening of great food and drink (forgot to mention the 5 glasses of prosecco we had... Each!)I would highly recommend this restaurant as a treat or special occasion, or everyday if you can afford it
4
A solid option for vegetarians in Singapore. Tasty and creative food, but slightly pricey (and a little heavy on the cheese).
4
Food was great with large portions. Server was really friendly and ready to provide his recommendations when called upon. Overall a really good dining experience.
5
Went for lunch with the family. Very easy going and casual. Super service, excellent attitude of the staff - very gracious and polite. Fantastic food ! Must go and ask for Marcus !
5
I've sampled my fair share of falafels and this is probably one of the best in Singapore. The menu is varied and it all tastes great. If all vegetarian food tasted like this, no one would eat meat.
4
We've been dining here on dates / special occasions since 15 years ago and Original Sin still serves what we think is the best lasagne in Singapore (even though it's vegetarian!). The mushrooms and thick slabs of brinjal (eggplant) seem to have shrunk over the years but the taste is still delectable and we can finish it within 10 minutes cos' it's just so delicious. This time we had the pomelo salad which was surprisingly good and refreshing. The daily special 4- cheese pizza was crispy and my teen son finished it in a jiffy. Some of the desserts however were way way too sweet. The brownie with oat milk icecream was sugar overload. I expected the brownie to be more bittersweet and to use more dark chocolate. The hazelnut praline was rich and good but serving size was very small and also too sweet. Tiramisu is still our all time fave. Apple crumble was surprisingly good. Crust is so deliciously crumbly. We burnt about $180 for 2 lasagnes, 1 pizza, 1 small pomelo salad and 4 desserts (pinch!). Prices have gone up over the years so let's save this for special occasions.
4
Ambience was welcoming and set up cozy at first when crowd hadn't arrived. Ordered their mains -'absolut' pasta which tasted good and an ever-popular potato dish (which I forgot the name), alongside starters pomelo salad and truffle fries + delicious tiramisu dessert. All were decent with a Mediterranean flavour. Wait staffs were really attentive and patient even though restaurant was totally full by around 8pm. Kudos to the service team of 5 serving and running around tables with at least 70 customers
2
I was there for lunch with my friends and the restaurant was so busy. I told my friends how popular this restaurant to veggie lovers and how nice the food they are serving. When we are ready to order suddenly nobody was there to attend to us. I know how busy they are as crowd goes wild. Until i got a chance to spoke one of the staff, after ordering i ask who is the manager of this restaurant and they inform me that he is Off for the day and the next guy in the pisition was the big guy inside. I didn't know that my friend was a great observer and he told me that the incharge guy that suppose to be the one taking care of the restaurant and the costumers was standing behind and wiping the utensils until we left the restaurant. I feel ashame to my friends and told them that maybe we came in a wrong time.But they were so happy because the food was great and fast even in a busy period
4
Three of us went for a quick healthy lunch. We had two falafel salads, a lasagne and a spinach tart that came with a roasted mushroom with melted cheese on top. The food was excellent, the portions decent, and the consensus was that we would return. However, at $116 for the 4 items this isn't your usual cheap and cheerful vegetarian restaurant. Nevertheless, the reason they've survived for at least 15 years is the quality of the food they deliver, the attention to detail, and the efficient service
4
Across the road from the busy part of Holland Village in Jalan Merah Saga, is this awesome vegetarian Mediterranean food restaurant. It's got both indoor and outdoor dining and would advice to make prior reservations especially for dinner. The food is very good, and service excellent. Try out the specials of the day and the friendly staff would be happy to explain. Been going there for years now and keep coming back.Only advise is for the main menu to be refreshed at regular intervals. A meal for 2 excluding drinks would cost around S$120
5
We went here for NYE dinner. The service was first class and the veggie choices were great too. The restaurant is in the lovely Holland Village area of Singapore. Recommend here for lunch and an afternoon shopping trip as an alternative to dinner reservations. We always come back here when in Singapore
4
Nice Italian food, only vegetarian. Choice of tasty pastas, pizzas and other dishes and good service. Choice of table inside and outside. Reserving a table in advance is recommended . Closes at 10.30
4
quality of food is very good,but quantity is less for the price they charge.. they had an option to choose gluten free.. cool right? vegetarians can absolutely dine here.. good ambiance .. preferably on late evenings.
4
Tucked a ,little away from the bustle of Holland village is this great restaurant. Good food for those who enjoy vegetarian or those who just enjoy something a little differnt.
4
Nice ambience. The pomelo salad, pasta and dessert were excellent. The chargrilled eggplant was too salty. Service of the staff was impeccable.
4
We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday. The dinner was really good with the food tasting its original sweetness and natural yumminess altogether. The whole meal was really delicious and filling.
4
Their vegetarian food is wonderful ! Nature and delicious! I will invite my friends again if they still got promotion like this.
5
Food was yummy esp the Pasta - very authentic~
One of my Favorites is their magic mushroom. The Portobello is yums!!
5
I am a meat eater and I hesitated when my partner decided to dine here celebrating our anniversary. I was sceptical. He said we should try something lighter. Well, I have no complain! I totally love the food though. I thought I would be going back hungry but I am not. Love the dim light romantic settings. Am coming back for sure!
4
A vegan friend of mine was visiting and original sin came highly recommended. We booked via Chope one month in advance so we were a bit surprised when there was no record of our booking when we arrived. Luckily the place had plenty of spare tables so it wasn't a problem. The starters were really nice - we had the halloumi and the turkish bread - and the lasagna was good too. Service was pretty awful really (only thing stopping a 5 star review). We were sat outside and really struggled to get any servers to come and help us. Would recommend but don't expect rolls royce treatment

This place has all the best of Italian fare cooked without meat or egg which makes it so great. The starters and main courses are heavenly. You could pick any dish from pastas to stuffed mushrooms the size of your hand and it will be finger licking good. Their desserts are even more gorgeous coz even vegetarians like us can eat son really yummy desserts without worrying about checking for egg in it. Its a must visit place if you love Italian food even if you are not a pure vegetarian

I haven't been to Original Sin for years and forgot how great the food is! Tasty hearty vegetarian is hard to find. Perfect for a catch up with friends!
3
One of the few more upscale vegetarian restaurants- such a petty that the food is unimaginative, heavily reliant on white carbs and just not very well executed.
5
Real ingredients, fresh and tasty.
Good pizza. Absolute pasta was flavorful, one of the rare kinds in Singapore.
5
Wonderful evening with great company and delicious foods and service. Always has been my favourite vegetarian restaurant.
5
Loved this place for both ambiance and the food.
The pizza needed a little bit of seasoning, but my pasta was amazingly out-of-this-world tasty. The waiting staff are friendly.
Good place for a dinner with friends. Fine dining atmosphere, great food, and good service.

I used to love coming here as it was a rare truly vegetarian restaurant - something that's difficult to find in Asia, particularly a decent one Problem for me is that back then, I didn't eat mushrooms, so my choice was limitedHowever, I have since come to appreciate the fungal taste and couldn't wait to make a return Portobello mushroom with ricotta cheese had to be the starter of choice for meI would've gone for the moussaka had I not been fairly full from an earlier indulgence elsewhereWhat I was surprised to see was less specials and a great emphasis on being a Mediterranean restaurant Either way - highly recommended if you want to give the carnivorous appetite a missTake exit A from the Holland Village MRT station (circle line) and cross the car park to enter via the back entrance @ Chip Bee Garden

Holland Village is a happening place in Singapore and quite popular with the expats. We visited the Italian restaurant 'Original Sin' for dinner and were pleasantly surprised that it dishes out only vegetarian fare ! The pizzas & pastas were awesome! The service was fast and atmosphere was relaxed
3
Is it just me or have the prices gone up significantly here? The lunch special was $34 for a main w/ a small salad. The set lunch was $28. I realize its Singapore but this seems to pricey to come for lunch. The food was just ok. 
5
I've been a vegetarian for over twenty-five years and it's always good to check out veggie restaurants in new locations. Based in Holland Village, it is off the tourist trail and. as with any city, it's good to go to different parts of the city.The food was good and always a welcome treat to know that what you are eating is truly vegetarian. It's pretty typical bistro food but vegetarian. It's what veggies enjoy
3
We were a bunch of friends and ate lunch here. Food is average, that extra oomph to take it to the next level is missing. We ordered the bruschetta ( was a bit soggy) mezze platter, again we found each paste, like hummus, baba ganoush was very average, there was a pumpkin sauce/paste which was not great at all. then the main was veg pizza, decent. the desserts apple crumble, tiramisu and the brownie were also just ok. At anywhere between 15-35$ each, these dishes didnt live up to our expectation
5
The food was fabulous. I loved the salads and the lasagne was to die for. The truffle fries were also very good. Thoroughly enjoyed my meal :)
5
Great service and great food. I had the daily special and the Risotto was amazing! Wine list very extensive. A great place to try and keep coming back to.
3
Not sure why this restaurant has been around so long, perhaps due to lack of competition for vegetarian restaurants. The food is expensive and nothing special.
4
I was brought to this vegetarian restaurant by my business hosts. The style is Mediterranean with lots of options. Outstanding Burrata with tomatoes and an excellent Haloumi cheese dish, All tasty and plentiful. Highly recommended.
5
Tucked away & far away from the madding crowd, just off Holland Road lies ORIGINAL SIN - an upmarket vegetarian restaurant. The food is very tasty and the service is courteous... the chic & trendy ambience make it an evening to remember...
4
Great veg options. My wife is veg and the mix of indian, lebanese, and asian veg options was very good.

Original Sin is the best Mediterranean Vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. The food has been consistently delicious since I first dined there in 1998. They have a great 3 course set lunch for $28.00 ++ ending with a molten chocolate cake and ice-cream! The staff are very professional and attentive. You can sit indoors with air con or on an outside patio which is also charming in the evening. Even meat loving friends like to dine here
4
I am not a veggie lover so I won't be fair if I rate them on the vegetarian food. All the stars (I would give more than 5 if the place was not vegetarian, but that is irrelevant). I won't comment on main course, but the mushroom soup was very good. But the highlight for me was the wonderful chocolate lava cake with ice cream. Chocolatey, but not cloying sweet, the centre oozed like it should for a perfect lava cake. Served with a decent vanilla ice cream (I have lowered my expectations about vanilla ice cream served with desserts). Another friend ordered apple crumble, which was excellent too. I will return just for desserts. And keep my fingers crossed they add some meat to menu one day
5
Our dinner at Original Sin was one of the best we've had in a long time. A vegetarian restaurant, but also has a fabulous menu that clearly shows item which can be prepared vegan, without onion/garlic, eggs etc.. Our reserved table was waiting for us, and clear explanations were given on vegan options. The food was delicious and the service excellent. We can't recommend Original Sin highly enough - absolutely worth a visit
4
I was in Singapore on Business visit for 2 weeks and a friend suggested me this restaurant. It is in an amazing place right next to Holland Village MRT station. This is one of those restaurants where you can order anything on the menu and it will be good. I can say that for very few of them worldwide. I felt it was a bit overpriced as this is not a fine dining place. It did not pich as much as I was on a Business trip. Moussaka and Mezze platter are top notch. Lasagne is one of the best I've had so far
3
We went during lunchtime for colleague get together. Portion of food not very big except Pizza is filling. Tiramisu is good
4
We ordered the broccoli pasta and the absolut pasta to our surprise! It actually taste yummy! Too bad the staff didn't inform us that they have a risotto special dish else we would have ordered that. Would come back again for it!
4
Really liked their salads, their mains were okay but the salads were amazing. I liked sitting outside.
2
I usually do not post much because, generally, I believe that every place deserves an opportunity. But there is always a but! Food is SUPER expensive and quite frankly nothing amazing for the price... The place looks great, has outside seating, well decorated etc .. but since I do not go to a restaurant for its decor, and outside seating, I must say I was quite disappointed by the food and, I cannot be energetic enough... THE PRICE! We did not even go for the specials... we just went for the plain old and simple baba ghanough, hummus, pita platter (the pita was good though) and moussaka (which was bad). Anyways, if you like to go there for a glass of wine, enjoy the outside seating have some tap water and some pita bread its an ok place. Hey, maybe it was the chef's day off, but still, to have such a nice location, call yourself a Mediterranean restaurant, have bad moussaka and serve below average food? That's a "no no". I just hope the Restaurant reads the comments so they can get better. Its really just about that. Nothing else and NOT AT ALL trying to be super mean, I have my hate blog for that..
2
Visited Original Sin on Sunday for lunch. My husband had the set lunch for $28++ and I had the mushroom for starter and the "special", listed on the blackboard and unpriced, truffle and mushroom risotto. The MSG in the starter was overpowering and I had quite a severe reaction.The risotto unexpectedly came with real truffles and cost us over $50; something we did not realise until the bill arrived. I felt we were conned into ordering the dish as it was inadequately described.It was difficult to get the attention of the staff and the service when it arrived was lack luster.They are trading on an erstwhile name and reputation these days.Will give it a miss in the future
4
Food was good, can be catered to vegans, vegetarians without onion/garlic, gluten-free etc. An still manage to deliver good food on a plate. THough price was on the high side, not to mention it has service and gst charge as well, quite worth it once in a while
3
Pricing is on the high end and they don't serve water on the tap, its like in the whole Spore such water is easily available but instead you would have to spend $8+++ for the bottles of water hence we had to budget the choices of our food to ensure we had incurred the cost of the water as well..
3
My vegetarian friend chose Original Sin for her birthday dinner out because it's her favorite restaurant. They were desperately short-staffed that night though so the unusually slow service lacked any personal touch, and any requests we made were met with resistance. In fact, when when the birthday cake with candle came out, we asked for a photo - the waiter rushed away and told us, "Later!" It was comical, but disappointing too. Despite the poor service, the food was as delicious as always and the ambiance pleasant. I'm sure our next visit will be better. 
3
Lots of choice and variety. The risotto was the special but needed some extra salt but none provided. Service was good. Too full to eat dessert. Booked requesting an inside table which was not acknowledged but happy to change. Informed at booking we there to celebrate my daughters 16th birthday but was not acted upon
2
Food: We ordered 2 pizzas and a falafel salad. The pizza was terribly cooked. The base wasn’t baked through and it was ‘doughy’. When we tried explaining this to the staff they were extremely dismissive, not even an apology. My father however was quite pleased with his salad. Service: The service as mentioned above wasn’t at all reasonable. The staff was pretty rude and dismissive. We felt the restaurant should know that the pizza wasn’t cooked and we weren’t satisfied with our meal. Atmosphere: The restaurant is definitely quite nice. The décor, cutlery and general decoration was quite quaint. Unfortunately, the food and service really let the place down for us. Lastly, the entire Holland Village area is nice and this restaurant is in a great location, shame about the food
3
Excuse my un-refined language.
The food was good, especially for vegetarian cuisine. But given the ingredients and size of dishes, everything was quite overpriced.
The interior was very cramped, and as a result very noisy.
4
Delicious salads. I had the falafel salad which was excellent, crunchy falafel and fresh salad leaves with an excellent dressing. Makes a nice change from red meat!
5
We shared entres and the magic mushroom was very tasty loved it . My moussaka was beautiful as was my friends cannelloni . It was great to find a vegetarian restaurant . Service was attentive and friendly . We enjoyed our night here .
5
Very good vegetarian restaurant - one of the best I have been to!
The food was excellent and the service very good too.
In a nice quiet neighbourhood indoor and our door seating.
Reasonable price.
5
The pasta , pizza and the wine... everything was wonderful.... a treat to taste buds... I am a vegetarian and this the best vegetarian Italian restaurant I have been to ever ever!!
3
Well expected much more but was dissapointed
Mousaka came in 5 minutes and instead of baking it was flamed from the top Garlic Bread took longer :(
ok average nothing great
3
The starting salads were fresh with good balsamico. The pastas we could have done at home, so nothing special. The dessert, a chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream is why we had come here already three times in row now. Altogether three points for the food. The service was disinterested and the plates were almost thrown to our table. So two points for the service. Price for the set lunch of two was 75 S$, too much I think.
3
We've been going to Original Sin for more than 10 years now, and it was the best western vegetarian restaurant in the good old days.However a recent visit left us disappointed - the food was bland, the portions small and the bottle of wine we ordered was not chilled before it was served.With a lot more vegetarian options in Singapore now, Original Sun needs to find its mojo
4
Visited on Mothers day as a treat for my mum. The mezze platter starter was delicious and I was impressed with risotto of the day. Slightly expensive, but I suppose you are paying for the upmarket feel of the place. Overall I would definitely recommend if you are into vegetarian European food, the flavours in the dishes were nicely balanced
3
Upon arrival at this restaurant and after sitting down, I loved everything about it - the menu, the concept, the vibe, the crowd. It was a "Singapore moment" of "isn't Singapore a cool place to have a restaurant and cuisine like this?"Diners looked happy and food looked nice. It was so clearly understaffed and a patient manager explained to us the labour shortage in Singapore and his staff called in sick - he suspected they were on a date. Nonetheless, the two front of house staff members tried their best.Food came out quick and overall I'd have to say it was average - nothing special. I felt I could have made any one of those dishes at home with a bit more of a unique twist. We shared the haloumi and the mezze plate - nothing special and mezze was just mixed purees slopped on the a dish with some pita bread - good margins there, I'm sure. Halomi was nothing special. Mains included a rather bland mousaka of aubergine, lasagne and some other mains. Two apple crumbles were a bit meagre in size and nothing special - just some overcooked apples with some crumbs on top. Total bill came to about $330 with two starters; 4 mains; 2 desserts; 1 beer; 1 bottle of wine - bit expensive, especially as 'just' vegetarian. Nice concept but pretty average and not in a rush to return
5
Celebrated my daughter-in-law's birthday. As usual the food was mouth watering and taste delicious. Loved every bite of it. You just can't tell that it's vegetarian!
Excellent service too.
5
Original Sin has been a favourite for the past 9 years. The food is healthy, delicious and interesting. The staff are kind and give great service and there's a casual ambience that always has a relaxed welcoming feel.
4
Original Sin is a Excellent Restaurant in Singapore. Its Location and area is Very Good and gives us real Holland Look and Feel. Nice to Enjoy Mediterranean Menu with Salad, Dessert and Main Course. Must visit for a Food Lover.
5
A warmth ambience with a lively audience, coupled with excellent service and sinfully delightful vegetarian food. I'll be back more often to savour such lovely authentic Mediterranean Vege cuisine that's a rare gem in Singapore.
4
The name of the restaurant is humorous but the great food is nothing to laugh at. I ate a salad, others in my party had a pizza, spaghetti, spanakopita, and everyone was quite pleased with their food. Afagattos all around for dessert. The wait staff is friendly and prompt but not intrusive. They poured wine and water when they saw our glasses were empty. The atmosphere (inside and outside dining) feels like you're in a bistro. I'd return here again.
5
I have been dining at Original Sin since 1998. It is my favorite vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. The food is always consistanly delicious and the service professional and friendly. They have an excellent set lunch menu which is priced well and includes a molten chocolate cake and ice-cream for dessert. Even friends who are 'meat' eaters enjoy the vegetarian food at Original Sin!
3
I remember eating here 10-15 years ago and it was quite a fine-dining experience. The decor, ambience, food plating etc. were pretty impressive. Decided to return since i was in the area. Immediately i felt they had a renovation, and not for the better. Decor looks old, and the lighting was dim. Ordered the risotto and my colleague had the Spanakopita. Both were ok, but not outstanding. We ordered desserts - hazlenet chocolate cake and apple crumble. They were slightly worse than the mains. The cake was a tiny sliver of chocolate , and the apple crumble was just small pieces of apple under a scatter of crumbs. All in all, probably won't return anymore to this now cafe-looking plac
4
We had a quick dinner there and an overall very pleasant time. The outside seating is comfortable and the service was fast.The 'lasagna rossa' @ SGD 26.00 and the 'beetroot salad' @ SGD 18.00 were very tasty, though the portions are fairly small for my taste
3
Good food and ambience.Waiter asked if we wanted to get the bill right after we said we didn't want desserts. We were just about 40min into our dinner after we were seated and wanted to chat after dinner. There were empty tables. The feeling we got was that they were trying to chase us out of the restaurant.
3
If you are looking for vegetarian "western style" food, then Original Sin is an ok place to go for it although I suspect that Singapore probably has many better places around the Marina area. Situated in Holland Village ( an expatriate haunt), Original Sin is pleasant, clean, and offers reasonable value for money, with a good a la carte selection and a well priced "set lunch". It gets busy, so you need to book
5
I thoroughly enjoyed the food - from the appetizers to the main dish, everything was perfect. I went for a business lunch with one vegetarian and 2 carnivores and everyone enjoyed the meal. I would come back in a heartbeat!
3
The waitress there are not so responsive and not so friendly. They should improve their level of services.
3
The food was disappointing and expensive.We had corn fritters that were tasteless,stuffed peppers also tasteless and a vegetable curry that was ok.The staff were pleasant and the service was good.The restaurant is situated in a quiet part of Holland village.
1
This must be the worst service available in Singapore. Food mediocre. Glad that the poor service kept us from ordering more when we "tried" to order various courses. Completely disinterested.
3
I really enjoyed the food here and the Moussaka is recommended. Reasonable service. Italian styled menu. We sat outside and the traffic passing through the tables was a little busy for my liking. Would recommend inside.
4
Quite difficult to find quality vegetarian food in Singapore. We thought we give this a try and were not disappointed. All of us enjoyed our meals but the downside was the prices. For Singapore, they were a bit on the high side! Would I be a repeat customer? Only if I was in the company of vegetarians
4
Finding good vegetarian food in Asia that isn't mock meat is difficult at the best of times and this is where Original Sin stands apart. All of their food is freshly cooked using real vegetables and it tastes great. There is no mock or substitute dishes on their menu. It's a little bit tucked away but easy enough to find if you research it
3
I made special trip to this restaurant based upon a review on expat living. I was somewhat surprised at how pricey the restaurant is. A set lunch menu of a veggie burger and fries, side salad, and small dessert (I drank water) set me back $32SGD. The food was good, yes, but I'm not sure it was THAT good.
3
The restaurant is situated on a nice, quiet street. The decor is pleasant,The host who greeted us was very welcoming and the menu offers lots of choice, the drinks menu does too, but overall we weren't excited by Original sin. Service was polite but very slow. We had a difficult time attracting servers to our table. It wasn't a very busy night. We opted for the fritters for starters, they were fine. Next we had the falafel salad, tofu patties and the cannelloni. The salad was the best of the three dishes, it was fresh and the falafel was tasty. The patties floated in a sticky sweet sauce and were tasteless. A big disappointment for the $28 dollar charge. The cannelloni was tasty but very dry. The coffees and dessert were the highlight of the meal, we would actually come back during the day for coffee here. The tiramisu was delicious. This is quite an expensive restaurant and wouldn't attract us back for dinner. There were a few pizzas and perhaps the restaurant leans towards those dishes.
5
I made a reservation a week in advance for a primetime slot (8pm) for 2 people, and 2 hours before was still able to push it to 8.30pm. It shouldn't be a problem if it's just 2 people, but might be if it's more.Service was pleasant though our glasses did stay dry for a bit. Food came quite promptly. They gave us the dessert menu after we were done with the mains.The food was great! Very very delicious. We ordered a starter (magic mushrooms, highly recommended) with two mains and split everything between the both of us. That was enough for dinner, the servings are pretty substantial!As for the price tag, the range is about 16 to 20 for a starter, and 25 to 30 bucks for a main. Not something I could afford often but because of the pretty generous portions and the great quality it was all definitely worth it.Great place for a great occasion! :-)My only gripe was that I found the lighting too dim for my liking, I like to be able to see my food a little clearer
5
Having been a bit uncertain about an only vegetarian food option, I was very impressed by how delicious the food was. I can't wait to go back! A very relaxed and chilled place to hang out with friends.
2
Very expensive for very small sized portions.
Not very ellaborated dishes for what they charge.
Pumpkin salad dry and tasteless
3
A peaceful place to have dinner.
vegetarian food if very good. We tested the yoghurt bread with mushrooms and onions and the Princess salad. Both are very tasty.
Deserts - tiramisu and hazelnut chocolate cake - are a real treat.
4
I tend to have a lot of ladiesâ€™ lunches at Original Sin as a lot of my friends are vegetarian. Even a confirmed carnivore like myself can find something to enjoy! The Strozza Preti with a good glass of wine is fabulous and I love the ambience of the outdoor terrace, which has a great, chilled-out atmosphere
3
The choice of food was very good but I found the staff a bit vague when it came to getting assistance on 'veganising' my food. I eventually got what I wanted which was delicious but it was a bit of a struggle explaining exactly what I wanted. I just thought this would have been easier in a vegetarian restaurant.Also, the staff were keen to get us out when it came to closing time. Not that I blame them but they could have been more subtle about it
4
I was introduced to this venue by my very good friend, who is not a veggie. Its one of his favorite, and dining here was a nice experience. They have seating inside and an open deck, both well sheltered, but its better to reserve seats as the place was quite busy all the time. The all veggie option they deliver seems to be quite a fancy, and the dishes we had were remarkable. The service is quite good, and one can take a relaxed time enjoying meal here. The menu keeps changing, so a next visit can give further options. Its a top choice for my trips to Singapore.
5
I have been to this restaurants number of times. Every time I have enjoyed it more. I love their Italian food very much. We have had a lot of varieties of dishes like Pizza, Pasta, Bruschettas and so on. The best of all is Supremo Pizza with super thin crust and amazing taste. They serve excellent quality of breads too, especially the garlic bread.. They have both indoor and outdoor seating arrangements, which has its own charm
4
We opted for set lunch meal on Sunday. Staff was friendly, hard to find a vegetarian restaurant with a variety in menu that this restaurant offers from lasagna to pizza to risotto to a host of innovative fusion dishes. The food tasted better than our expectation, wasn't bland (even for an Indian taste bud), service was prompt, good background music and overall a good experience. Will go back again.
5
This is one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. The wait-staff are attentive and friendly. The food is delicious. I especially recommend the Mezze Platter- share it for a starter or have it as a main. I will not hesitate to recommend this restaurant to anyone.
5
Vegetarian restaurant with superb mouth-watering food. Service a tad slow but not unbearable, and in fairness it was very busy - and for good reason. We had the Bosco Misto, which was the winner, the risotto and the lasagna, and everyone loved their meals. Then I had the apple crumble desert which was spectacular. Good wine list and drinks menu. This is now my favourite non-Chinese restaurant in Singapore
5
I have lost count of how many meat-eaters I have dragged to this restaurant to convince them that vegetarian food can be delicious, amazing and totally satisfying. Original Sin does all this, effortlessly. It really is my go-to happy place where you can guarantee first rate food and professional table service as well as a carefully crafted wine list. Can't speak more highly of it. Please click if this is helpful! Thank
4
Went there with a friend, we shared the starter mezza platter. And then had a main dish each. Very good food, although a bit slow to give us the bill. I guess this would be a nice place to bring a date. Kind of pricy, but worth the money
4
Went to Original Sin two nights in a row with a number of work colleges and we had a lovely time; food was very nice atmosphere was really relaxed. We shared a Beetroot salad and I had the Bosco Miti (unsure of spelling??) that was amazing! Music was very nice and relaxing too! Really enjoyed it and will return (later this week or next time I come!). We didn't have any issues with our order but the staff wanted to check multiple times with what was ordered which was a little frustrating mid-conversation
4
Visiting the restaurant , suggested by a good Singaporean friend, on 03MAR with little or no expectation. We, 3 of us, were seated open air as the climate was quite pleasant. The restaurant offers Mediterranean/Italian vegetarian food. We ordered 3 starters {Bruschetta, a mesclun and arugula salad with avocado (the avocado is a substitute of cheese) and 2 main courses (a veggie moussaka and a pasta with pesto sauce). The avocado is a good sub of cheese and I personally prefer it to cheese, very refreshing and make the whole dish lighter. I am sceptical of a moussaka without meat but it turned out to be very good and tasty, just love it. The pasta with pesto sauce is very good too and again light and not too heavy. The portion is very good and they have no issue for us sharing the dishes.I would recommend the restaurant to the anyone including the carnivores. Try out the tasty foods of this veggie restaurant
4
we got an opportunity to try food at original sin. Its good location very close to holland village MRT station. Food taste is good love the Bruschettas and Beetroot salad some thing very unique.Margarita taste good not too sweet compare to other restuarants its on high end price wise.
5
Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, we ordered was outstanding. We had the mezze platter to start, followed by the spanakopita, the moussaka, the vegetable tandoori, the strozza preti, and the supremo pizza. To finish, we ordered all five desserts on offer as there were five of us. Chocolate brownie - yum! apple crumble - yum! Cheesecake - yum! Tiramisu - yum! Hazelnut chocolate cake - yum! The wine was lovely too. Best Valpolicella I've ever had
5
This is one of my family's favorite restaurants. Kids menu provides a few good options, the daily specials are very good and the service is always prompt and friendly. We have tried many dishes and Original Sin always delivers!Parking can be a bit of a challenge but there is plenty available on the side streets. Recommend reservations for holidays and weekends
5
If you are a vegetarian and if you are tired of seeing just 2-3 options of vegetarian food against the multiple meat options on a menu, this is the place for you!!They are a fine Italian restaurant located in a wonderful vicinity. You can book your table online before you go, to ensure you get seating! It is usually full..Their food is brilliant. You can start with some bruschetta and olives. Then you can dig into their pasta (with a flavor of vodka) or their amazingly well made lasagna. They have a good selection of pizzas too, which will be heart filling!Then their desserts - it sure is SIN! :-) Dig into their Tiramisu, you will never be sorry.They serve a wide range of wine, very detailed collection. A perfect place to take your partner on a date or your friends and family for a treat
5
If you're in the mood to try something new, head to Original Sin. This is a vegetarian restaurant near Holland Village and is on a quite street along with a few other eateries. The Bosco Misto was very new to me but was a great fine - we ordered again the next time we went back - good stuff! Their Mediterranean platter is a great starter along with many others on the menu. For a great deal, go for a weekend lunch and opt for the combo. With a soup, appetizer, main course, dessert and coffee, this is one of the best deals in Singapore for the quality of food
4
it is hard to have vegetarian options and this place just proves it wrong. the starter, mains are very good and the flavors are nice.this opinion is not after visiting this place but a number of times.the staff is polite and since we were two families, they left us alone to enjoy the lunch, though place was crowded and set lunches were mainly the orders. for us, the a-la carte was fabulous too
4
Had a nice dinner with colleagues sitting outside.
Food is good, I had a big pizza while others enjoyed pasta , moussaka, or vegeterian rice dishes.
Good place.
3
We ordered a moussaka and a vegetarian tandoori. The first was not bad while the latter was too ordinary to served at such restaurant. Overall, the food was absolutely overpriced!
4
With its varied menu, it is easy to return to Original Sin to try different dishes and we have done so many times over the years.
Parking is only slightly improved with the recent addition of MRT lot, so either cab it or take MRT.
2
Okay food but no value. The place is very dark, almost impossible to read menu. I guess they think it is romantic
5
I've being eating here for 12 years and never had a bad experience. My fave veggie restaurant- even my carnivore hubby loves it!
2
We were disappointed by the quality of the food. We have been here several times a few years ago and remembered it as a good restaurant and so were very disappointed that the quality has dropped significantly. All the items we ordered failed to live up to our expectations. The tiramisu was one of the worst we have had anywhere. Overall very disappointing, especially given the fact that this is not a cheap restaurant
2
Very average experience. Uninspiring menu.Most dishes contain cheese or cream so not suitable for those who don't take dairy.The dish i ordered was heavy, contained too much salt, and bland in flavour. I left half of it and ate when I got home.Staff did not make us feel welcome. We were only 2 and dispite the place being half empty, we were only allowed to sit at a 2 person table. The restaurant itself is rather dark verging on dingy.The wine selection was Ok.Overall I expected better quality for the price charged
3
A good vegetarian menu, plenty of choice with different textures, tastes and variety. Loved the option to sit inside or outside, the street is nice and quiet. The best thing about my meal was the tiramisu for desert, which was nice and soggy with coffee (just how I love it). Surprising for a restaurant that 'seems healthy' there are no fresh juices, they all come in a bottle. This then would include all the fruit cocktails on the menu, nothing fresh there just out of a can or bottle. Both my dinner companion and I had the same food, we shared a beetroot salad to start and then had a stuffed pepper dish. Although it was fine, I did think I cook better at home. That then leads me to question why would I choose to eat out? Of course, to have something a bit special, something I don't do that often myself. Perhaps this is a good restaurant for those who just want a break from coking at home. But for those who want mean that is better then they can do themselves, this is perhaps not the restaurant
4
We went for lunch, and whilst it wasn't busy it had a nice relaxed atmosphere. The menu is extensive enough, with mains ranging from about S$20 to about S$30. There is also a fixed price lunch for S$27. The pizza was really good, probably rivaling the next door pizza place! The stuffed capsicum was tasty, if a little small for a main course on its own. Overall, a nice relaxed place with good choice of food.

Good food, good service and, now that there is an MRT stop right next door, it's a great location. It's not on a busy road so you can relax and enjoy the company, even if it's your own.We sat outside and it was quite pleasant with just a bit of air movement from the fans.I will definitely be back when next in Singapore

For a place that claims to be vegan/vegeterian I was shocked when the chef told me that the cheese has animal Renet !
Have no comments to add.

Original Sin has a good range of vegetarian delights and daily specials. It has a very relaxed atmosphere and outdoor as well as indoor seating. Good value.

I had the mezze plate, bruschetta and lasagne. The mezze plate and bruschetta were excellent - I like the bread, baba ganoush and a mashed pumpkin dip. The lasagne was okay, a bit mushy. The servers were attentive. The overall dining experience was pleasant

I really like this place: the (vegetarian/vegan/etc) food is good, the location is nice and quiet, the atmosphere is pleasant, service is very good. It does have one negative: it's quite pricey. Which is why I love the set lunch menu: for $27++ you get a 3 course meal plus tea/coffee, which is great value. Also great: the set lunch is available on weekends!So come here to chill out before 2pm, or in the evening if you have a bit more to spend. The risottos are delicious

Just visited friends today in Holland and we went for lunch. They have a great set lunch for 3 courses at a very reasonable price. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the quality of the food was great, very tasty and friendly portions. Well recommended.

I am a vegetarian and this restaurant is paradise for me. I am not used to having so many choices on the menu generally and I feel spoilt for choice here. The best dish for me here has to be the Bosco Misto. Their pastas are also good but try something different from the usual pizzas and pastas to get a true taste of their food. Service is attentive and the location is quite good with both indoor and outdoor seating. I have heard most meat eaters love the food here as well, so its definitely worth a try. Its definitely not cheap and a meal for two will set you back by $100 including drinks and starters

Went for a Friday night dinner and loved the selection (was difficult to decide). We wound up ordering too much, and everything was very flavorful. Even the risotto and pesto pasta were both rich while somehow avoiding the typical levels of oil/cream/butter. Salad was full of flavor. Fresh ingredients. Will definitely go back. A little on the expensive side for what it was, but it was worth it in the end for us

One of the best, if not THE best vegetarian restaurants in Singapore. First of all, I frequent there at least once a week. Why? Sometimes it feels healthy to have a vegetarian meal once in awhile right? Some of you might not agree... especially all those meat eaters out there. But this place serves vegetarian food unlike any other, no raw chopped up veg, no mock tofu meat!!! It's like real food just without the meat, and trust me, after having a meal there, you won't be craving for supper afterwards. My usual would be the magic mushroom for appetizer, and pasta or pizza for mains. The mushroom, which is huge portobello mushroom, with ricotta cheese, tomato sauce, basil, mozzarella etc... sounds too cheesy for an appetizer? Who cares!! it's awesome!!! Perfectly cooked, tender juicy mushroom! A MUST TRY DISH, I SWEAR BY IT. Only if they can make it as a main =) The pasta is really good, somehow it gives me the homemade feel, just like how an italian grandma would make it! Pesto pasta is the one I would reckon. You surely can't go wrong with that, al dente pasta coated with light cream sauce. It is something refreshing and healthy and you'll won't feel guilty after having a big plate of pasta. The pizza is yummy, love the generous amount of toppings, thin crust pizza baked to perfection. Melting stringy cheese, fresh marinated veg~~ truly something special. Good for sharing with a bunch of friends over beer or wine.Oh yeah, the wine list is huge!!! I am quite sure there is a wine for anyone. Well... with that kind of food, who needs meat

This place is situated at Holland Village and you can go there by MRT train (Holland Village Stop) as its just next to it. Went there to celebrate a friend's birthday last Friday 23rd August . Loved the way they made the menu which had lots of Mediterranean flavor.We selected Mezze Platter as the dips reminded us of our trip to Israel.(This humus was a little more spicy and nutty than what we had there but still as delicious). We also tried the Basilico salad followed by Primovera Pizza and Bosco misto as mains. Loved the Bosco misto which was tofu patties coated with crushed almonds and sesame seeds, asparagus and a button mushroom plum sauce. We picked this dish randomly and was pleasantly surprised by it. Even though it was all vegetarian we didn't miss any meat that day ! Worth the money if you wish to spend it to do something different with great friends on a special day

We dined here because one of our friends was a die-hard vegan.
Food was nice, although I cringed at some of the prices.
Lovely wine selection, though.
Would I come back here again? Perhaps only if all my dinner friends were vegan.
4
Very nice vegetarian restaurant that has maintained its high Quality of food for over a decade now.
Downside is it is a wee bit pricey which prevents one from going there more often
5
This wonderful restaurant will please even die-hard meat-eaters (guaranteed they will find something they like). Terrific selection of main courses, nice wine list and great service in a trendy location--Holland Village--makes this a top choice for your list of dining options in Singapore.
5
had my anniversary dinner here.Lots of choice for veg. Very impressed with the preparations and ambiance .Value for money ,MUST VISIT FOR A TRY
4
We say outside and enjoyed a nice meal here. The 100% vegetarian restaurant was a nice change. Beer is really expensive and for 5 people our meals came to nearly $300.
5
I love the food here. Many vegetarian choices but good meat options too. I just wish it was easier to get here.
4
Interesting vegetarian menu, daily specials on the wall. Food was good even for the non-vegetarians, I enjoyed the daily tart/quiche that I had. service had some challenges for a group of 10 with a couple of missed appetizers and some timing issues,
5
This was the best meal of my entire trip to Singapore. I am a vegetarian and while I do not face a huge challenge with meal choices in sea-food loving Singapore; this meal undoubtedly was exceptional.Good variety of options across Italian, Mediterranean cuisines and large portions make for a fulfilling meal. The staff is also extremely courteous.We visited with friends and had the mezze platter and mushroom for starters - absolutely tasty...The mains ranged from pasta to mousakka to spanakopita and having tasted each, I can say any option will be a good option.Situated in lovely Holland Village, you can choose to sit outside and enjoy complete peace and quiet

If you knew me you would be shocked at my reaction to this vegetarian restaurant. Located in Chip Bee Gardens close to Singapore's famous Holland Village this casual and friendly restaurant delivers great tasting vegetarian fare. I have eaten here a few times and have never been disappointed. My recent visit saw me ordering the set lunch meal with a juice, spaghetti pasta and chocolate cake.The ruby juice, a mixture of beetroot, ginger, orange and carrot, is blended well and is refreshing and healthy. The spaghetti was wonderfully cooked - perfectly al-dente unlike my experience at an Italian restaurant in Rochester Park - and the asparagus, french beans, semi-dried tomato and feta came together really well and I didn't even notice that there was no meat.By the time dessert rocked around my belly was very full and I only managed a few bites of the chocolate cake. The vanilla ice cream was delicious and complimented the richness of the cake. The set menu was finished up with tea and for $27 I was very satisfied.Holland Village and its surrounds are spoiled for choice when it comes to restaurants and a lot of the places simply don't deliver like this well-hidden gem. Obviously die-hard meat-lovers may resist the temptation quite easily to dine here but by doing so they are missing out on some high-quality food served in a simple yet stylish restaurant with great service.Give this place a chance - you won't be disappointed (unless you really, really feel like a steak)

As a self-proclaimed carnivore, I was extremely skeptical about dining in a vegetarian restaurant, however was given no choice in the matter. What a refreshing change! Oriental Sin has a good selection on the menu, and although we all devoured three courses, all of which were extremely yummy, the tiramisu was delightful and presented in a way that I have not seen it served before. It definitely was the highlight of the meal. Will keep this restaurant in mind for when I entertain health conscious friends and visiting family
4
Its a lovely cafe with both Indoor and outdoor seating. Good food. Separate area for smoking (you cant dine whilst smoking). Lovely ambience, beautiful crowd.
4
Great selection of vegetarian options at a nice setting. Service was good and prompt, but do watch out for the mozzies if you are sitting outdoors. Bring a jacket/shawl if you are sitting indoors. Nice place for a date.
4
The staff were friendly & helpful & their service was good despite it being full even though it was a Monday. Luckily we had made reservations. It's a cosy little restaurant at the Holland Village area.

Bad food, poor service and overpriced. Not a good evening at all. Will not be back ever.
5
Since it was lunch time picked the set menu, roasted tomato soup, mediterranean wrap and vegan dessert - everything was really good and beautifully presented. The restaurant was very clean, able to see into kitchen which appeared well run and free from mess, ladies toilet was spotless. Staff very attentive, would have been nice to try and evening meal too but sadly quite a distance from the hotel
4
I wish we'd had more time to try a full evening meal. But luch was a simple tasy soup/wrap/dessert. Options available to cope with different dietary concerns and they were readily offered.For the price, they'd have got a 5 if the dessert hadn't seemed about half the size I'd expected but the quality was excellent

Original Sin was my hubby and my favourite Italian restaurant until we moved quite far from Holland Village. This time we went for lunch with our 2 boys. The kids' menu is real value for money. At around S$9, they got a big dish of mushroom pasta each, which was tasty. Our all-time favourite is the lasagne (quite pricey at S$26 but worth it). You just have to try it as it's super creamy and delicious! The portion looks small, but before the end, you feel very full already. Staff were ok and regularly checked on our water glasses, but service felt like they were "obliging" rather than "warm". Can be more generous with the smiles. Otherwise, if you love vegetarian Italian food, don't miss this restaurant

Good quality vegetarian contintental food and good service. Overall it was a good experience and I would go back again. On the other hand, it is a tad expensive in my opinion and the considering the prices associated, portion sizes are relatively small. Of the desserts, we ordered two - the sticky date pudding which was fabulous and the marble cheese cake, which was extremely dry; I would not recommend that
2
just do not go. it's awful. and expensive. and the service was appalling - both inept AND unfriendly... there were 6 of us and the food is so incredibly unimaginative and mediocre and the prices are just plain silly. is it so unique to have a vegetarian restaurant that is not asian inspired that you have to charge $18 for a small salad to begin with? and then wait forever for it to come while other people at your table were served 15 minutes before? my tandori vegetables and tofu were just a joke and even the rice was bad. look, we are fine dinners and also eat at hawker centers. we know food and service and are generally tolerant. but this place was shameful all around
3
Original Sin is a wonderful place to eat if you're a vegetarian, vegan or herbivore. Selections of entrees and mains are very delicious. Service was alright. The problem is, the indoor area is pretty tightly packed together. Not exactly a place where you could have a romantic dinner when there is a baby screaming on your left and some guys toasting multiple times on your right. I had a hard time eating and have a conversation. But overall, service save the day
3
Appetizers were nice... main course left a little to be desired. But then I am a meat eater...
3
One of my choice when I crave for pasta. The Absolut Vodka Penne Pasta is really good
5
Anyone who does not have good impression of vegetarian dishes will definitely change their opinion once they have been to it
4
Been here a few times. This is a very good all vegetarian restaurant. Loved my tofu burger with eggplant relish. The tapas plate is good too. And serves decent salads. My pick for those special occasions with veg. friends.
3
The food quality has dropped a lot and I don't know why. i had the vegan salad and the dressing was bland and not that special. the garlic bread is VERY mediocre and I can easily prepare something way better at home. definitely not value for money at all.. I will not return
4
Though its tough to find an all vegetarian restaurant serving only continental cuisine,The 'Original Sin' restaurant in Singapore is one such find.Would recommend this to all vegetarians looking for inspired continental or European fare.The wine accompaniement is also very professional in its scope and compatibility with the food served.The presentation is also pretty.The only blemish that one could think of is that the service is a bit laid back if you are trying to fit in time frames.Would recommend that reservations are made well in advance as the place gets filled up very quickly

I lost my cell phone at the restaurant. In 30 minutes, I go back and try to find it. ( also call before we go back to the restaurant) The so called manager said he didn't see my mobile phone but he would check with the staff then get back to me tomorrow. He never called. I contacted him again on next day and said I would pay if anyone can return my mobile phone. It is so important because I saved so many pictures and songs of my lovely son. He said would call back me tomorrow again. Again, he never called. I feel so sorry to choose the restaurant. I wish I never go........The staff there are not honest !!!!! A good service restaurant should always take care of his customer. Food is ok but the price is too expensive for vegetarian restaurant
1
Food is not as good as expected. It is easily to get much better vege food with this kind of price. I would think even vege dishes sold in food court are much much much better than what is served over in Original Sin. Overall, this would be the first and last time I will step into this restaurant and definitely will not recommend to friends for the pricey food here

Things we liked:* Area was trendy; good options for other places for drinks and dessert before and after* Service was quick and friendly* the Mezze platter was delicious, particularly the pumpkin dip and the fresh, firm pita* Tandoori kebabs were really wonderfulThings we disliked:* Obviously trying very hard to market itself as much higher-class than it is. While the decor was very nice (cool copper bar!) and the flooring, colours, etc., were very nice, it showed itself to be a little worn: the bathrooms were pretty gross, the air ducts along the window were really dirty, and the air conditioner was dripping onto the table next to us* Tables were too close together and ceilings were high which combined for a LOUD restaurant* not at all a good value for the price -- I have no problem spending that much money for an amazing experience but the atmosphere, noise, and only-average service did not live up* the "basmati" rice was just plain white rice, a little overcooked * the server asked whether we would prefer still or sparkling water -- and then proceeded to charge us for the water -- $12.00!! -- we were stunned by this oversight in their service and this exorbitant priceOverall:I think they are trying too hard and the details are suffering. I would choose another veg place or another trendy place instead

Ate here two times on my first trip to Singapore. Fabulous food. Excellent. Service good. No complaints. Highly recommend this. Not sure why it is so low on the overall rank for restaurants in singapore. Perhaps because it is veggie? Don't let that fool you, food is FAB
