The wagyu beef was tender and succulent which combine with the rich beef broth. Kudos to the Chefs and service staff are genuine friendly and helpful. Would recommend to all my friends who likes to come Singapore

Big portion, great beef broth and the wagyu beef is tender. The price is a little bit high. But it is meet the quality.

This place serves beef noodles and some side dishes. Come here only if one likes this. It's self service, quick and efficient.

We've never been to this place before and we kinda just decided ah well what the hell let's just try. Turned out to be one of the best decisions we made all week. We ordered the pork rib dry noodles and the special dry noodles.... both were awesome. The great thing is you can select a soup on the side, either their signature pork soup or the beef broth... fantastic! The couple next to us ordered the beef broth noodles and that looked fantastic (you can order spicy or non spicy for the soups too). The spicy wanton side dish was delicious and well made - decent portions per wonton, not the pathetic size that most side dish wontons are. Even the kangkong was fresh and not cooked to death. One advice, the positions are super big, so if your planning on ordering a lot of sides, and there are only 2 of u, just order one noodle dish to share first. Alternatively, you can tah pao what u can't finish (which is what we did!)Will definitely be back again

We ate dinner here Friday. The ordering process is simple. Choose your soup stock (beef, pork,) and whether authentic, pickled cabbage or spicy. Choose between rice noodles, vermicelli and la main noodles. Hand in your order and wait a short time for your meal. I ordered Vegetable Pork Wanton Noodle, not spicy, la main noodles. It was exceptional. The broth had enormous flavor, the wantons were very tasty and a big pile of the noodles. Vern ordered the Braised Fresh Beef Noodle, pickled cabbage stock and also la main noodles. He enjoyed it also. The prices are very reasonable. The clientele changes regularly so we did not have a long wait to be seated

Paradise group has never disappointed and this is one of their lower priced outlets, well so far from what I've experienced.The noodles (la mien) have a nice chewy texture and the seasoning is well balanced and flavourful. Not the usual, super oily, dry noodles that is quite typical and it's the same with the dry as well as soup offerings. Ingredients are fresh and just the right quantity. Though I'm not so used to the pork wanton soup as it's more like crystal dumplings but since I've not been to Taiwan, this may be typical Taiwan wanton. Soup is really good, not salty but thick with collagen being made with pork bone. I've got a soft spot for pork soft bone and this is cooked just right. Not crunchy hard and not over cooked to become mushy. The beef is tender and still has a good bite to it too. All in all, I would definitely recommend you'd try this. I'm definitely going back soon

Good but not over the top. You can't get to wrong with a bowl of piping hot noodle soup. They offer a generous portion of noodle, sadly the premium beef would taste better if they're not cooked well done for over 3-4 hours (but that's the way it is).This is a good choice if you're unsure what to eat around bugis

Wasn't really looking forward to eating in a food court but have to admit, this is a good one. Very attentive staff and the food served was plentiful and very tasty. Reasonable prices too. Had the pork wontons with chilli noodles and the dish was very tasty. Would return

Came here for lunch about 5 times at least as it is near my office. Sometimes i do bring my overseas colleagues to try. I like their beef sauce alot and you have to get the sauce by yourself. The beef soup taste great! Recently they seem increase the price, which I make me seldom go for lunch anymore as the price is like normal restaurant standard. if you at bugis rarely and want to try beef noodle, this is still a good spot to be at.Enjoy
