I would say that this is about as authentic Thai as you can get for neighborhood restaurant. Friendly service, no frills and reasonable prices. Beef noodles and Kuay Teow are particularly good.

The standard is very consistent over the years. Cosy small restaurant, the Thai lady boss and her Thai team whips up authentic Thai food at reasonable price. Only woes is hard to park.

Cafe style Thai food. Didn't have some of my favourite dishes on the menu. Good if you are in Neighbourhood but not otherwise

Nice little place in the suburbs, good service with nice smile. Salads fresh and great choice, soups and green curry fine but maybe some extra sweet added.

Came here w BFF since the Penang stall down the same row was closed. Plain and laid back ambience. Nothing fancy. I read the other reviews and was surprised that they do not serve drinks/desserts without first ordering mains. That's quite ridiculous especially if it's during off peak hours. After all the red rubies are not even worth eating. The serving is small, not chewy and not crunchy fresh too.Ordered chicken roll, beef soup, beef noodles soup, tang hoon salad and red rubies as dessert. Total bill $44.00. No GST, no service charges. The Beef Noodles Soup and Tang Hoon salad was quite good. Not fantastic but passable. BFF said she felt quite thirsty about an half hour after... Her beef soup was too saltish, MSG maybe? Average Thai food place run by Thai people.

Been there twice. First time to eat, found the food very mediocre. Even the competiton in Singapore, how did this place survivor so long. Second time, for dessert and a drink... They said that they do not served dessert and drinks only if we are not diners. And it was rather empty when we went in. I would imagine with the margins that they make on desserts and drinks, that they would be happy for us "eat & drink" there. After some negotiation, they said their bosses said so. Anyway, food was really really only ok (the surrounding restaurants are better), the dessert of chestnut was very diluted as was the ice coffee. Overall experience was disappointing.

Modest, laid-back, family-feel. The staff (family members?) saunter around in their "home"-clothes. Service is a bit brusque, but genuine I guess.Food arrives super fast, and was delicious. Esp. tom yum seafood noodles and green curry chicken.What's most remarkable, is the quietness of this restaurant. May not be for everyone, but I dislike noisy, chaotic restaurants.I would suggest they change out the dull PL (fluorescent) lighting though

Went to this restaurant on friday night and it was not crowded at all. Place is quite and pleasant. I like the food even portion is quite small for the price. Green curry was good! Their menu has picture so easier to decide what we want

My friend and I arrived at 3pm to grab a cold drink and possibly a dessert or so we thought. After we were seated, we perused the menu and made our order. When the waitress realised we were ordering only drinks she informed us that they did not serve "only drinks" or "only drinks and dessert" but we were required to order a main course as well. Had it been the peak of lunch/dinner time, I would have been more understanding of this (unwritten/invisible) rule, however we'd just had lunch elsewhere and were itching to have a Thai dessert which was how we found ourselves there, in a slightly overdressed cafe with 2 other tables of couples (and, yes, they were eating main courses!) In the end we each ordered a red ruby dessert and a drink. The drinks were fine. The red rubies and the service were less than memorable

The place itself is located in a nice area, easy traffic and the parking isn't too bad. The food is just amazing. The olive rice, pad Thai, green curry : even if you don't know the dish, order it! Everything tastes great! When you're done with your meAl, definitely try the red ruby! The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is really nice
