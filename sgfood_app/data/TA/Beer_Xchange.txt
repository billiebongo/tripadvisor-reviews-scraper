The staff were friendly and accomodating. Ambience was lit with live band ongoing. Food could be improved on but overall, thumbs up!

It was my second visit.

Good explanation given by waiter who served us on choice of food and ongoing promotion.
Food was of good quality!
Will visit it the third time.

Great food here. Spaghetti is great, pizza even better. Thin crust, sauces made from scratch. Highly recommended!

Food and service is good. There is also live singing which makes the ambience great! Only thing that the prices are pretty steep over there

Ordered a couple of pizzas, pasta and a pork chop. Everything was good and happy hour made it better! Darts and pool after dinner also made it a great night out.

Visited Beer Xchange for a friend's birthday celebration. We were quite a regular to previous Beer Market. Had a great night hang out with my gang of friends there.

Food was horrible. Steak was tasteless. I ordered medium rare and it came totally rare, it was like eating raw meat. For the price that I paid, I could have MUCH better steak elsewhere. Place was too dark to have a proper dinner. More a drinking place than a dining place. I'd never go again

A nice and cosy chillax place for friends to gather and catch up. A cup of free beer promo for chope reservation per pax. Food quantity is just nice, quality is not bad. Service can be improved, prepare utensils in advanced would be good. Overall, not a bad place to visit

Tried their ribeye steak & XXXL pork chop, consider quite good for a pub. Especially their XXXL Pork chop which is really value for money as itâ€™s big, crispy & yummy. The night we were there the band was really good. But they mainly sing mandarin & Cantonese songs, not that I mind. ;p Service staffs are friendly & helpful

Went there for dinner, light beers & the live band.The food is not bad, the selection of beers is good, the live band is great. There are dart & pool machines for entertainment.The service is friendly except they tried t charge for a pizza takeaway box, I asked them to pack it in foil for free instead.The pricing is considered expensive, spent around $200 for 3pax consisiting of a light beer, pizzas, pastas & soft drinks
