Hidden Gem where you can enjoy your meal in a very reasonable price in Westgate Jurong East. Freshly Grilled and excellent taste and awesome charcoal-grilled Japanese skewers.

Found this small place. At the basement near the Isetan supermarket. A bar counter style. Limited seats. Only 5 seats in fact. But the grill and the marinate is as good as it gets. Worth the wait. Prices are reasonable. As good as any 5 star restaurants.
