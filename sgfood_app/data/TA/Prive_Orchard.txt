It is a great place for having delicious breakfast. Eggs Benedict, muffins, bacon and ham were nicely done together. Great service and a lovely place to start the day watching the morning crowd.

Came here for dinner. Their service was very friendly and nice , observant and caring. Smiley and very concerned and care for their food etc. Orchard road view and nice chilling music.

Average food, slightly on the pricey side and coffee so-so. Good service. Lots of birds flying into the restaurant
5
Cheese chicken wings was tasty.
Date pudding was yummy
Ambience is lovely !!!! Great place to chillax!

A super pit stop amidst shopping - we were here as a couple with my parents who were visiting.
Vegan options available and nice setting to recharge before hitting more shops.

The restaurant is located at the corner of the road, making it ideal for people-watching.The menu has both Western and Asian dishes. The Truffle Mushroom Soup was fragrant. We overlooked that the eggs that came with the Truffle Mushrooms egg dish was poached, so we asked for them to be well done. We faced a little difficult getting it changed initially. We apologised when one of the captains came over and with a little explanation, we got the eggs cooked to our requirement.We were grateful they were flexible.

Located at the corner of the road giving it maximum exposure, the restaurant has a lot going for it. It is ideal for people-watching, but I reckon the management is trying to cramp as many tables into whatever space they have, thus making the tables a little too close to one another.The menu is a mix of Western and Asian dishes. The Truffle Mushroom Soup was fragrant with the pungent aroma of blended mushrooms. The Chicken Curry (served with either steam rice or baguette) was a little on the watery side. A thicker curry base would be ideal. We overlooked that the eggs that came with the Truffle Mushrooms was poached and so we asked for them to be well done. We faced a little resistance until the one of the captains came to our rescue. With a little explanation, we got the eggs cooked according to our dietary requirement.For that and a little flexibility, we are grateful.

After a long flight to Singapore from the UK, we were unable to check into our hotel also on Orchard Road a short distance away and so very weary, tired and hungry we took refuge in this cute pavement cafe/restaurant.Thankfully there were fans to keep you cool, not climatized yet to the humidity and dressed in attire for England at winter and the plane the fans were very welcome indeed.This is a popular place particularly for those wanting breakfast - we ordered a beer which was a jaw dropping 15$, a glass of wine at 14$ for 125ml and shared a club sandwich which also was pricey hence why we shared. We hadn’t anticipated how expensive it would be and hadn’t brought sufficient money from our luggage left with concierge to choose anything more!It was very pleasant and the service was good and despite the price we enjoyed it and were grateful for its existence as our hotel wouldn’t allow us to take breakfast on arrival even with the offer to pay for additional breakfast.I would stop by here again if in Singapore because it’s also a good place to people watch, catch your bearings whilst sight seeing

Just dropped in for beers and people watching along Orchard. Great ring-side seats and a decent beer selection, but even a half-pint is $12 SGD. Service was good and friendly. Would probably go back some evening just for the views of Orchard Rd and the people on the street at night
5
First time ordered breakfast menu at Prive & it was very delicious. Me & my girl friend love the food so much. The location is very centralised & ambience is the best for just relaxing on our off day.
5
The food was good and reasonably priced. The service was fair but the ambience of the cafe made up for the slack service. We were intrigued by the big screens across the road with advertisements of the latest movies.
5
My husband and I are regulars to Orchard Road Prive. Great good , service and cocktail. Right next to Wheelock and ION on Orchard road .the best location to relax and chill after or before shopping
4
Amazing spot to always have a quick bite and yummy desserts. Portions are big and local floor service stuffs are truly great. The others could really follow or be sent for trainings.
3
Poor lighting within the restaurant and we had to use our mobile torchlight to view the menu. Prefer other Prive outlets where the ambience is better.
4
Had the festive's special salmon which was flavourful! The baby potatoes were nice too. Wish the portion was bigger though.
4
Great View, portion sizes were generous. Service was okay but it was more for the atmosphere. Great location for in town entertainment and shopping.

We were on our way back from visiting the Botanic Gardens, and decided to stop in here for a cold beverage and a bite to eat. It's right off the sidewalk along Orchard Rd in the heart of the shopping district. After the 2 Km walk from the Gardens, we appreciated the shade and a place to sit. We each had a cold draft beer, served with ice water on the side, which was appreciated. There is a great deal for a small bowl of spiced nuts for only S$1, if ordered with a beer. The bowl was bigger than expected, plenty for 2. My partner had a delicious BLA (bacon, lettuce, avocado) wrap that was fresh and yummy. Just after our food arrived, a classic afternoon thunderstorm engulfed the area, and we were happy to be inside. They do close the shutters and lower screens along the frontage to keep wind blown rain from entering the space
4
Atmosphere and aesthetics were really nice. I came for lunch and I ordered a mushroom soup and it tasted and smelled really good!! Order did not take long to come and service was good. Location was great as there was a great view and close to the shopping
5
Had a great Christmas dinner with my girls. Staffs were all accommodating and friendly! Even recommended great drinks to pair with our food and my friends canâ€™t stop ordering it. Food was great, as usual! Although the hazelnut coffee was so-so, but the dining atmosphere and food is awesome.
3
Food was overpriced and tasted average at best. Scrambled eggs looked more like fried eggs even after a second attempt (first serving was sent back). Service was nonexistent.
5
Great food and location however terrible service. The ultimate breakfast is the best brunch option over there.
4
Great for people watching under a fan on Orchard Road, with great coffee!
Friendly staff, good music.
5
Great place to have dinner and drinks with gfs and do some people watching as it’s just along the streets of Orchard Road
4
Warm welcome by the host, food did not take long to be served.
Overall, great experience dinning at Prive@Orchard. :)
4
We had a few drinks (classic Mojito’s) after work.
Sitting on the first row and watch the world go by.
Location perfect but service could be improved.
4
Staff were very helpful and coffee's were good. We did not eat there, but from what we could see the food looked good and the quantity plentiful.
My only complaint would be that the cushions at so moved to another table.
5
Stopped in for lunch while in Singapore, great authentic food.
Staff were friendly and location was fabulous.

Could not change the chips on my sandwich to salad/vegetables, restaurant could be more flexible with the menu.

Saturday 5:30 PM:After waiting 15 minutes i decided to ask the waiter for the menu, till then he wasn't motivated to offer us the menu it seemed.6:00 PM:I decided to call the waiter since he never came back to ask us if/what we want to order.I ordered two glasses of WHITE wine.6:15 PM:45 minutes after arriving we got one glass of white and one glass of RED wine. I refused the red one and asked for the second white wine that I have ordered.6:30 PM:I still haven't got my drink, I asked for the bill, which of course indicated 1 red + 1 white, which took me just a few seconds to solve the problem.We had to leave because our movie in the cinema opposite started at 6:40, so we couldn't afford to wait another 60 minutes for 1 freaking drink.If that's the service that you can expect for a glass of wine that costs you 20SGD including service and GST they will never ever see me again
2
The place is too noisy as they blasted the music, almost impossible to have a conversation with your dining partner. Food was average too, i very much prefer the chijmes and keppel bay outlets
4
We had a great time. Great food and ambience. Music is very catchy. Only if you could include the bottle of wine in your happy hour promo, that would really rock.
3
Awesome location-- reasonable food and drink though pretty expensive-- ok considering location but not fully worth it
4
Location along orchard road is great and the food served here is uniformly solid, unpretentious and tasty. Nothing special but consistent and well executed. Recommended for diners looking for a nice people watching spot on orchard road.
3
The location is decent and good for a catch-up between friends and to have a few drinks.
The food is average .

Be very careful on short measures..
They have a sample glass to measure wine,
But generally also short...
Really feels like they do not like you questioning them.
Such a shame, great potential but this cheating has to stop..

My fiance and I decided to have brunch at prive today, and I must say I was sorely disappointed. We called over the waitress to take our order, and I started my sentence saying "could I ask about the ultimate breakfast", and before I could finish my sentence she went ok how would you like your eggs done. Ok, maybe she didn't hear me so I asked again as I had wanted to change my bacon to streaky instead of the maple one. She stared at me for the longest time and I had to repeat a few times till she understood what I wanted. Then said she'd ask and get back to me - which she never did. Then I told her I wanted my eggs scrambled well done, and she smirked at me and said so you want omelette? At which I was a little pissed off but my fiance said no, scrambled but we don't want it wet. Not a very difficult request I would say. So he orders what he wants and we wait for food. His order of eggs Benedict came with the hollandaise split. My order - "scrambled" eggs that were barely warm, and not even proper scrambled, it was marbled which means it wasn't scrambled at all. Lucky the change on the bacon had been made.My fiance and I have been in the F&B industry for a long time and it's sad that staff are not trained properly in food knowledge. But then again that waitress certainly had an attitude to her. Even the coffee was bad. 6 bucks for a small bad coffee. I've heard a lot of good reviews about the prive on keppel but did not expect this kind of service or food quality here. Hope the management will work on this

I went to the other Prive before and so far I considered the food is reasonable. So when they opened one in Wheelock Place, I thought of giving it a try.I made a reservation through CHOPE for my family at 8 AM. After I made the reservation, I received a thank you note and a reminder to come to the restaurant.I reached the place at 8:02, the restaurant is still closed. But there was a lady inside who was sitting in the dining area and putting on some makeup.We decided to stand at the entrance while looking at the menu. Once and awhile I glance at the lady who seemed to be oblivious to us. After a while, I decided to call the restaurant but it went to voice mail.In the end, we decided to walk over across the street to another cafe and I was happy we spent the money somewhere else

This place does not have aircon, if you are unable to stand Singapore's hot weather. However they installed quite a number of fans, so the place is not stuffy. This place is good if you feel like people watching, and have a short break from shopping.We ordered coffee and cajun potato wedges. The wedges are crispy and good. It does not have a greasy feel like some other places.I ordered a flat white coffee which comes in a small cup and costs $6. For $6, usually you will get better value in other cafes
1
We found a hair in the mushroom soup and approached the manager in a nice way in order to prevent attention from the other customers, however the manager just took the soup without any words. Not even a single sorry from him nor the chef. Therefore we waited for an action from him and still nothing, so we decided to cancel it anyway. They all acted that it was normal to serve such thing..
4
Nice food and ambience. No waiting for seats required when we arrive. Service was prompt and seats were comfortable.
4
Very nice place to chill and relax along the busy Orchard road. People watch or have a hearty brunch.
4
Good place for brunch with friends if you like alfresco seatings. Nice atmosphere during good sunny weather. Not so nice during rainy weather with birds flying into the cafes.
5
In the middle of a busy orchard road, prive is just a piece of heaven! Good place to catch up with friends or even have a quick bite while you're in a shopping spree. The welcoming staff is a plus! Will recommend it to everyone!!!
4
A nice place for casual hangout with friends. Good ambiance, good food. However, prefer the menu at Prive Chjimes
1
I ordered a Passion Fruit margarita. It was watery and diluted. It looked as if it had been left sitting around for a while being it was served to me. Not worth the $17 that I paid for it.
5
We are Singaporeans and this is not the first time we had a drink and a snack at Privè Orchard. We like the location, staff are friendly, always smiling and attentive, the place is cosy, music is not too loud. Yes, if you are visiting Singapore you must visit Privè Orchard for a wonderful experience of Orchard area, especially at night

We called in here for a quick lunch on a shopping trip in Orchard Road. The service was of a very good standard, but particular mention must be made regarding the helpfulness of the staff. We wanted to find a specific building on the street map and asked 'our' waitress for help. She said that she didn't know where the building was but promised that by the time we had finished our meal, she would have found the location ..... and she did !! Wow !!Our meals - Mine was Hainanese chicken rice, definitely the best rice I have ever had. My wife's meal was a ham omelette, absolutely packed with ham !!Highly recommended

This place is good when you don't get much options to eat in Orchard road late night as all malls closes around 10 pm. Though we have visited their Clark Quay & Chijmes outlets in past and had great time & food there. This time we Ordered curry chicken from Asian selection taste wise it was good but the potatoes were uncooked. Sides and drinks were also good. What disappointed me and surprised me from chefs cooking wise the 2nd main dish which was pan roasted Chilli & lime Salmon with ratatouille, broccoli, couscous, dill mustard cream sauce.Served in big deep bowl the salmon was well cooked but only with salt and pepper no Chilli and lime the ratatouille was nothing uncooked tossed few pieces of zucchini onion and pepper in tasteless red pasta sauce 3 pieces of steamed broccoli & a spoon of bland couscous ( no seasoning nothing) topped with some type of taste less white sauce with no hint and traces of dill and mustard on it. And we paid 20$ for this particular dish

We had dinner there and I was disappointed. The food was below average and the service so so. Of course, most people wouldn't go there for the food, but just to do some people watching on Orchard Road and have some drinks. If you want to to that, I could recommend it. But know that they've squeezed in the tables to closely to one another that several of your neighbours will hear what you are talking about. They're really trying to make the most of it. I don't blame them because with such a location, it's probably very difficult to make it profitable. Wouldn't go there again for food, but maybe for drinks, although I'm not sure yet given that the tables were really very close to one another..

The food were decent. My Boyfriend liked the beef pasta. I had salmon, moderate. They offer quite a good deal during happy hour. :)
2
Ambience was quite good but a little warm as it's alfresco plus the weather was humid. Staff can be more attentive.
4
Good place to relax in orchard. We have order the main course and brunch at noon, and children get the painting paper.

Located in the Wheelock Place mall, right at the Orchard Road MRT station, is this cafe type place facing Orchard Road. Met some friends here for drinks Saturday evening. They do offer a happy hour where certain bottles of wine are discounted.
5
Just outside the Orchard MRT station facing Orchard Road.
Great service and vibey music ambience.
While watching the passing traffic go by .
10% Service charge and 7% GST included in the bill.
Open till late.

Was offered 2 small table for 2 of us, could have been better if there's a bigger table. However, Great food, curry chicken is a must try!
5
Very cute Parisian style cafe with lovely outdoor area. Great coffee. Situated on the busy Orchard road so perfect for watching people walk past - nice break from the air conditioned shopping centres! Service was average. Nice aesthetic to snap a few cheeky instagram pictures

Loved the Prive outlet at keppel bay more. This is a smaller outlet with a good ambience and for you to people watch. Been there 2x and the service staff always seems busy. Even when the bartender saw your queuing and looking for assistance to be seated he just cant bother to alert staff who is collecting drinks from his counter. More attention needed to be given to people who are interested to dine in your outlet....

I have visited here with my friends to have brunch. First of all, no staffs passed menu to us so we had to ask for menu. Also, it was very humid as it was after raining. However, the food was very nice and one of the staffs was very kind as she answered to my question about the coffee very well with smile(I think she is a Russian). The Eggs Benedict was really nice
5
Great food as always and the most perfect service from Donna. Last time I came here was with a large group from work and Donna was also our waitress, again as per last time she never fails, truly service with a smile and nothing is too much trouble...This is a great little place to relax and enjoy!!
