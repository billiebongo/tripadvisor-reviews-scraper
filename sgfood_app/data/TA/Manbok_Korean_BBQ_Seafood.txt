Great selection of meat/soups/noodles and the list goes on. Servers are helpful with helping you BBQ the meat that you ordered. On the other hand, servers are spending more time taking care of their friends tables. Value for money is average.

If you like Korean BBQ, this is the place to be. Free flow of meat and all different kinds of condiments. Good value for their buffet. Need reservation for dinner especially weekends.

Manbok Korean BBQ & Seafood .Located at 19 Cheong Chin Nam Road, Singapore a casual dining ambience that whips up the finest Korean buffet delights. Enjoy a unique spread of the freshest vegetables, seafood, chicken, and meats. The food that we tried was simply the best. On the whole a must try for all Korean food lovers, It gave me another view point of having Korean dining in a sophisticatedly way. The Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. Overall, So Satisfied, We Couldn't Ask For More

Went to the outlet at Chinatown, Restaurant is along the main road, easy to find, Meat was well marinated, with a pinch of sweetness after bbq. Staff was helpful and polite. Variety of raw food and cooked food is quite limited. Don't think I will be coming back

We went to the Restaurant in Bukit Timah on Cheong Chin Nam Road. The lady at the door was rather rude and abrupt, except for one waiter, nobody really spoke any English. My daughter and I opted for the Korean BBQ buffet for 25 $ per pax. The meat they brought out was of really low-quality, very fat and chewy, not nice at all. And the bacon....oh my-pure fat. The BBQ came with a few other dishes. We enjoyed the seafood pancake and the Korean sushi, the seafood soup with tofu had really no seafood and was a bit spicy. The soy chicken was deep-fried, but the taste of the meat was juicy and tender. The potato salad was nice too. Wouldn't have minded a bigger portion. Feeling a bit annoyed that we were not told that you can keep ordering since it is a buffet. Overall a mediocre evening with terrible service and only a few dishes that were enjoyable. Don't think I'll be back

I have always been a Korean food fan. Love the army stew, BBQ, spicy beancurd soup, etc.Sister recommended Manbok to us and we decided to go as one big family to try. We ordered a pork set ($57) + 2 marinated beef + 1 spicy beancurd soup + 4 big bottles of Hite. Total damage was $200 for 5 adults. We ate a lot.... The pork was not not marinated at all. But they were really fresh. No stale or porky taste. The pork set came with a steamed egg and ice kachang as well. We really enjoyed the food. Service was prompt! Try to be there by 6.30. Otherwise u will have to wait in line (long Q) for a table! Thumbs up!

Very great service from the staff. Constant changing of BBQ plate which means that you will not be grilling on the burnt plate (like some other places).Good variety of food choices. Fresh ingredients. Cooked food like chicken wings are super popular!Always my first choice whenever I think of Korean BBQ

My girlfriend and I were staying close by in Chinatown and arrived to our hotel starving after a long flight from Taipei. We went to Manbok Korean BBQ based on the TripAdvisor reviews and we were not disappointed! I really enjoyed the cooking aspect and the food was delicious. You have to try their marinaded spar ribs...I'm still thinking about them a month later! If you're in the area, definitely check out Manbok Korean BBQ

Feel unwelcome. Alien. Sorry it will be my last.
I am here with a cheerful heart but the mood here is really very bad.

We usually order the set menu. The food is very fresh, restaurant offers free flow of ice water and side dishes are not chargeable. The Korean staff are attentive and come by often to help cut the meat. It's our favorite Korean BBQ restaurant.

This is my 3rd visit to Manbok. I love Korean BBQ is this is Manbok my top favorite.What I love the most is how they regularly the offer to change the BBQ hotplate knowing there's soot after a round of BBQ.Many other restaurants would throw dirty looks when anyone request a change of fresh BBQ grills enough though it's apparently covered with soot. But at Manbok, the they it for us frequently throughout the meal.My family loves this place and we had a good time & satisfying meal

While visiting China Town we came across this Restaurant and gave it a try.Wow, amazing !!!You get meat, salads, vegetables, noodles. dressings as a self serve and need to cook it on your own grill at the table where they even have a boiling Broth for the noodles......Its a great experience and Staff were very helpful and explained everything.While grilling, Staff replaced our Grill plate 2x when they saw it was getting dark.For Desert you can get Ice cream and fruit.Love that Place !!!!Everything is very clean and looked after.Except the Counter area needs a bit TL

A friend brought me to this place, due to his korean friend recommendation. I went to the shop at 116 Neil Road.I could not BELIVE how tasty the meat was. We orders the marinated pork short ribs.I was expecting something like usual ribs, with bones, etc. No. The meat comes "folded" , and the waitress slowly unfolds it and puts the long strips on the charcoal fire. Then she cuts them up and start to serve you. When you put those small, moisty, tender and perfectly cooked pieces of meat in your mouth, you'll not believe how good it is. I fell in love with korean cuisine right there. Been to this restaurant a few times already, and I'm not able to order anything different. Marinated pork short ribs. Remember that name, go for it and thank me later

We felt like something different to eat and being Paleo Korean was an obvious choice. After having walked past Manbok we decided to try it out. It was a great evening with a help yourself buffet style nicely presented meats, seafood and condiments. It's always great fun to prepare your food at the table bbq the meats. All tables have the option for bbq as well as steam boat.The staff was fabulous, very helpful in an unobtrusive manner. We certainly will go back

I'm a fan of Korean BBQ food and Manbok is my favourite. Love the food and excellent service here. The Bulgogi is very well marinated, super tasty and tender; definitely one of the better bulgogis you will find in Singapore.The service staffs are amazingly friendly and attentive. Makes the dining experience very pleasant and memorable

Was craving for some meat to end the day and here we are at Manbok! Pork and beef for BBQ was well marinated and waiters were helpful in helping us cook the meat. Not forgetting to mention the side dishes which are so delicious, such as seafood pancake and soybean soup..will definitely go back for more! One of the best KR bbq tasted so far..
