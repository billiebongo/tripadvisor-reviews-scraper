The ramen here is pretty good and my two kids can each finish an entire bowl on their own... I am talking about adult portion, not kids meal! ðŸ¥˜ my favorite ramen is the pork yakiniku! The crispy dango and mustard chicken are nice too.

Average ramen, but good value lunch set. Add a few dollars to get a drink and a side dish. Okay for lunch during work days.

Ramen play in Singapore can see every place in town, reasonable price and nice.
Our first date spend in Ramen play also, we have great date for the day.
Thank you.

Love their ramen and shabu shabu at the right price as well. Visited this place multiple times for lunch and/or dinner. The service was a bit slow during peak hours though. However, still totally recommended!

Had a meal at the Bedok Mall branch a few months ago. I had a look at the menu before going in and I found a fundamental error in the menu. I should have known better and walked away but I decided to try anyway. The noodles are not ramen but the usual wanton noodles we get from the hawker centre. They try to pass off this noodle as ramen. I am not going in there again

I went on a weekday lunch with colleagues. 8 of us and seating was arranged fast. We ordered 6 ramen sets and 2 shabu shabu. I requested 1 iced lemon tea to have less ice but all were given less ice. One of the orders was wrong but quickly rectified after wrong order was served. The food was overall ok. Ambience was ok too.Order any ramen and top up S$4 for a set. Choose a side dish and a drink from the list for the additional S$4 top up.I selected chicken gyoza and it was tasty. Ramen was ok but soup was tasty.Average cost is about S$20 per person. Definitely not for budget meal

There are too many ramen place in Singapore. Ramen play is not the best but they do serve average ramen for me. It considers mid range price compare with most ramen shop. I always get the tonkatsu ramen, overall taste good with points added because of egg. Conveniently located at novena square. It is easy to access.

We loved the tofu and the endame at the Novena outlet. If you opt for a set meal it usually comes with miso soup. The highlight for my kid was the float which is essentially vanilla ice cream floating on top of a carbonated drink with lots of ice. The ebi fry prawns are mouthwatering. The highlight is the chilly powder which has a wonderfully unique yet not so spicy taste when added to the dishes. This is a place for quick service but can get crowded during lunch or dinner times.

Ramen play have become my routine stop whenever Im in Singapore. Recently went to their branch at Novena Sq shopping mall and tried their featured dish "Butariki Ishanabe" - rice in Hot Claypot. It was INCREDIBLE!!!! Tip: There's also another branch in Sentosa Island.

Had lunch at Ramen Play with colleagues.
Food is little oily. Little stomach upset after the meal. Do not really fancy their food. This is one and only visit to Ramen Play.
Average food at above average prices. Unlikely to visit again.

The noodles were al dente, the broth flavorful, the proteins-meats and eggs hit the spot and quite filling. I recommend Ramen Play when in Sentosa Mall/Casino for those hungry for a good Ramen bowl.

Probably my 3rd time to this place, as usual, ordered the Ramen, still able to maintain their standard, food is good, service is good too, a good place for ramen.

Nothing special with the Japanese food in this restaurant. We dined at their JEM Jurong outlet. The most popular dishes are highlighted in their menu which will at least give you an idea which dishes are popular with diners.

The brown ramen broth looks and taste fine. The appetizers are average. For the quality, I think prices should be divided by two. It does not taste much like in Japan.

So I've been eating in this restaurant every time I visit Singapore. This restaurant would always be in my plans at least once a visit. I would even cancel my last meetings just to go here. I never got bored of the food there soI hope you guys would give a try :)

Service was good at Bedok Mall.Ramen of fish and pork broth was light but after a few gulps of the soup it doesnt have the kick that you get from other competitors even though they are more salty hence the soup base is still lacking in other ingredients to give that quenching thirst of exacting ramen broth.It comes with stewed egg and bamboo shoots.To complement we added gyoza to our meal with ice lemon tea

The chain under breaktalk group and do have above average ramen. The taste seems depends on branch. I had at other branch before, but seems not really prefer it. Recently lunch time, I visited again due to cold weather. This time the ramen taste good to me compare with my last few experience. I think I will be back

Good attitude, responsive, caring, courteous, prompt, efficient & considerate.
