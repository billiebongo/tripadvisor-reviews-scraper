Had Salmon sandwich and British bubblegum for drink. It was just okay, taste wise. Service is good though. Ambience is nice too.

First off, the best mash potatoes I have ever eaten; overall, The Mad Sailors was a wonderful place to have a relaxed birthday dinner, and the menu is adorable, and very, very yummy.

Went there for lunch and had a pretty good portion of the burger and fish and chips. Crowded during lunch time and entertainer made the meal so worthwhile.

A great place to hang out with friends! Casual dining at an awesome location. The food is value for money & delicious.

our first visit to The Mad Sailors where we ordered the Grilled Seafood Platter.. the only item that is grilled in the platter will be that of the squid and the chilli sauce that came with it was really spicy.. it was a different experience from that of the usual Fish & Co, Manhattan Fish market out there.

Was pretty disappointed with this place. The food actually looked quite good but I decided not to eat after I saw the serve all their food and drinks in throw away plastic cups and trays! Such a waste!I ordered a juice which came in a plastic cup. Surely if you charge $6 for a drink you can afford to purchase glass ware and teal plates? Or is it simply so you don’t need to wash dishes?Terrible for the environment.

It was empty on Sunday morning around 10:00 AM. But the door was open. And there was a single person in it. It was indeed already open.We were looking for brunch, as it was too late for simple breakfast. The menu was cool. All the brits 'staple' like Fish & chips, mash, etc.I forgot the title of meals we had. Mine had sausages and mash and pea mash. Tasted good. And big portion for little asian lady like me. My husband ordered avocado/turkey bacon/egg sandwich, my daughter pasta.They finished their meals fast and with content, so I assume the taste were good. The ambiance was good. Cool. Most importantly, it is Halal. And curious enough, they did not charge GST nor service tax. Price is already a bit high for my standard, but it's Singapore

The place was empty when we arrived and we had doubts about the place, maybe cos it was empty at that moment. To my surprise, the food actually was above my expectation. With the service provided (though they don’t charge service charge), it’s definitely a plus point and a place to go

The decor of the place is good but the food was mediocre. Ordered the bangers and mash and fish and chips. Bangers and mash - mash was cold. And bangers were rubbery. Fish and chips were not well cooked. The breading was still uncooked. Service was alright as after I told them about it - they offered a refund.

The place is nice - the ice-cream coffee we got was nicely ornated. Also the "natural cola" was pretty good even though kind of expensive. The place is hip and ideal if you sit as a couple - they have places where you can seat next to each other as opposed to facing each other

This is well worth trying.

Food was overpriced for fish and chips that's heavily battered with flour, wait was Long for our orders and even had our orders wrong. Ambience was relaxed and good for catching up with friends.

I went with big expectations and got huge portions and left with very light wallet... food was ok service was nice.

We decided to dine in at the Mad Sailors for dinner as they have offers on the entertainer app. The location is surrounded with noisy bars with live performances so it gets noisy and not so conducive for talking. The food was good - fresh ingredients and portions were okay. The service by the manager (I think) was very warm and friendly. Will definitely recommend this place for the food and service though probably u have to come before dinner time when it's less noisy.

Arab Street has been known to be very competitive with the turnover of restaurants and all its different concept. However, I sure hope that The Mad Sailors is here to stay. From top notch service (it may not be fine dining but their service is impeccable) to antique cozy ambiance. I guess their specialty is the burger which I kept seeing it being served the few times that I was there. My personal favourite would be their beef cheeks which is new on the menu. A must try! The beef is so tender and juicy, and I'm a big fan of steaks. I personally would recommend anyone reading this to give them a try. They have a wide range of drinks as well to match with the British-concept menu. Will try to come back as often, in fact I might come back tonight to order their beef cheeks again

Went there on sunday afternoon. The area are crowded since its a hip place for tourists in Singapore. Need a place to cold down and order coffee and dessert. Their coffee was decent and brownie was good. We got a table right away I guess it was our lucky day...

This restaurant is tiny, but deep in the culture that is Haji lane a fun and vibrant piece of Singapore night life. We both had fish and chips, the fish was great and crispy, but I don't like the rubbish like mayonnaise added without asking. Worth a visit if you are in the area.

Found this excellent restaurant down an alley near our hotel. The food was very well priced with really quick and friendly service. Had the curried mussels and my wife had the truffle fries - both were excellent. The staff were really nice and happy to customise a dish to suit my daughter's vegetarian needs. This is a small restaurant and well worth seeking out. Highly recommended

Had lunch here today. Only the brunch menu is available on weekends. Ordered a Big Breakfast that promised, amongst others, beef sausage and French brioche. That came after more than half an hour and one chaser. There was no sausage or brioche; 2 slices of sourdough bread were served instead. Asked about the sausage and the brioche. About 10 minutes later, the sausage was served with 2 slices of toasted white bread. We didn't bother to point out that brioche is quite different and if it is not available, diners should be told upfront. Our other order, salmon guacamole toast, came one hour after the order was placed. The orders cost $24 and $16 respectively. I would say the portions were not really worth the price (aside from the long wait)
