I must say that the ambiance of the restaurant is best in the area..I have visited once here and most importantly staff are very helpful and cheerful..I would suggest everyone should visit here once..

I had the Tutto Mare but asked them to change to spaghetti instead of linguine. Unfortunately, the spaghetti was fatter than usual and not al dente at all. Only consolation was the service was excellent.

Pizzas were fine, but we ordered carbonara and it was a little weird.
The noodles were not appetizing and a
little bland.
The service is alright as well. Not that great but not horrible.

Very disappointed with our experience at La Forketta. We were in a group of 9, one of the only 3 busy tables in the whole restaurant. Pizzas were good and decently sized; the rest of the food was well prepared but in outrageously small portions - a ~$30++ main of gnocchi contained exactly eight gnocchi; a melon and Parma ham was exactly 2 (two) slices of ham - in Italy you would probably be arrested for fraud.That said the real issue is service. Everyone was working in slow motion and totally disconnected with what was going on; we asked to add a table and nobody brought cutlery; the food took forever (we asked to serve all courses at the same time because we had kids with us and it took two hours at lunch!!!). We brought a birthday cake and they have an outrageous corking fee ($40); that was still fine as they‚Äôd told us when we booked and we accepted. However we had to ask them 4 times to clear plates from the mains and have dessert plates ready as nobody was doing anything; when the cake came 3 waiters were staring in the blank and yet despite 4 calls nobody brought plates.We asked them to waive the corkage fee as obviously that fee is supposed to cover a service they couldn‚Äôt organise. Despite escalating to the manager they wouldn‚Äôt do it: they obviously prefer to lose a customer that‚Äôs just forced out $440 but keep their $40 corkage fee. The manager looked like he wasn‚Äôt even understanding why we asked to waive this, obviously for them corkage fee is a tax in the book of rules. I‚Äôve rarely seen such brainless service and will obviously beer set foot in this restaurant ran by amateurs again.Avoid

After a long time we had visited this restaurant again. This time we had a table outside and it was fantastic. We went without reservation and they were able to accept us. Service, ambiance and the food was exceptional. We also enjoyed beautiful music with our delicious food. Pizza dough is very good, gnocchi is delicious and the salad was very fresh. Tiramisu was the star of our evening.

If you‚Äôre looking for top notch Italian at reasonable prices with quality organic ingredients, La Forketta is the place to go. The pizza I had was one of the best I‚Äôve eaten in a while and the pasta is freshly made daily and it was up to my standard. The owner is passionate about serving high quality food, to Ensure customers return.I‚Äôll definitely be going back for more

Staffs were friendly and attentive. Went on a raining day restaurant not so busy however the bread basket suppose to served before main dish served together with our main dishes. Pizza taste okay. Personally find that the pizza taste better in Nassim‚Äôs branch. However overall was a good experience. Cozy and helpful staffs. One of the best spot in Dempsey for chill out
5
La Forketta is one of the best Italian Restaurant you must visit in Singapore. If you are a pasta lover or Sea food lover you must try the Organic House Linguine in seafoods. The presentation of the food was excellent. The food taste is amazing because they always serves fresh pasta. The texture of the pasta is good because they process it well. The atmosphere was perfect very relaxing. Can't wait to come back again and try the different dishes. The service maintain excellent quality, friendly and professional. Money worth it! Keep it up team La Forketta

This restaurant looks like a fast food place, no table clothes, no ambience, no style.It s not worth the drive at all, more it s a waste of time and money. Food is really low quality, my wife had a wagyu steak which was recommended by the staff. She had to send back more than half of it, because it was full of disgusting fatty and chewy pieces. My pizza was also underwhelming with lots of black burnt uneatable areas. We paid 180S$ for two lousy plates and two glasses of prosecco. This is a rip off! A terrible place which should be avoided

An impromptu family dinner that turned out well. I own. Woodfired Pizza Oven at home and LOVE it. As such, I‚Äôm quite fussy with my pizza.La Forketta‚Äôs 48 hour process for proving the bases Lay‚Äôs the foundation (pun intended) for fantastic pizzas. The base is crispy but soft, and has a wonderful flavour - before we even start with the toppings.If you get that base right, everything else just flows, and it did last night.On another note, I reckon Gnocchi is a litmus test for a good Italian. These guys nailed it! Lovely soft ‚Äògnocchi‚Äôs‚Äô - really hard to get them done properly this way - and an amazing 4 cheese topping. Absolutely fantasist.Decor was good, the Dempsey Hill area great. Staff were friendly but some focus on how to pour wine would be worthwhile. We‚Äôll be back even tho is a little pricey - hey, but it is Singapore.

While on the expensive side, La Forketta serves up the most delicious wood fired pizzas in town. Located in beautiful Dempsey, a bit of peace and quiet right next to Orchard Road.
4
Service was friendly efficient and professional.
The food was very tasty well presented and arrived together.
Thoroughly enjoyable evening
5
While pricey, these are the best pizzas in Singapore! Wood fired and located in tranquil and hip Dempsey.
3
The standard has dropped compared to 3 years ago. The vongole pasta is not as tasty, I believe they have changed the recipe a bit but their signature Tiramisu still maintain their standard.
3
Food is alright. Prices might be a tad high for the portion size. I was not impressed but I did not walk in with any expectations to begin with.
5
Firewood pizza, warm environment and an excellent Dempsey Hill is a lovely place and this restaurant provide an warm and family friendly environment. Not too crowed nor noisier. Seating outside can be really enjoyable and the waitress Leslie was very kind with us. I do recommend this restaurant if you miss a firewood pizza.
2
Came here for Sunday lunch with 3 generation family. The emptiness of the large establishment should have warned us. The suggestion that we wanted a small spaghetti napolitana ie one main between two, as a starter threw them completely. Half way through eating this, one of the main course pizzas arrived and just sat there. After clearing the starter plates, the other four pizza showed up. OK but nothing special and the size of the bill was extraordinary for such a basic meal. Be warned
5
We spent a lovely evening with my family. Leslie, took great care of us. She was warm and very helpful. Other staff was also attentive. The food served was fresh and sufficient for our family of seven. We would love to recommend this place for any occasion. Thank you for a special evening. We definitely coming back soon.
1
We went in hoping for a delicious pizza. Whilst one was quite good the other was raw. In essence a pizza with raw peppers and onions on top. We complained and it went away and came back warmer but still raw. My colleague could not eat it and when the bill came it was still on there. I complained and the refused to remove it or any part of the charge. Never darkening the door agai
5
Had set lunch and was blown away by the pizza. It has overtaken pepperoni as our vote for best pizza. The bread basket ($5) included some pizza slices that were a prelude to the quality to come. The starters were excellent too. I enjoyed the minestrone soup which was a lighter version but the vegetables were so colourful. Confirmed by our waiter that they used organic produce. The spaghetti vongole had really fresh and bright coloured clams. The spaghetti was too fat and too al dente for my personal liking though some may like it. Tiramisu is a highlight and very good. The carrot cake was too fine for our liking as we prefer chunkier ones. Overall a very nice experience and good food. Portions for set lunch were generous, and amazing value at $33

La Forketta is located in green and leafy Dempsey. A former British army barracks. A chilled out place to eat. Fabulous food.

We had a nice evening at La Forketta. The food took a while to prepare but it was tasty. The pizza was good!
5
The staff and the service was excellent and fast , the environment was quiet and the portion serving was amazing .
5
The wood fired pizza was very special and delicious! And the desserts also very delicious! the service was nice !
5
Visited this restaurant with my partner last week, and they served the best tagliatelle wagyu! The wood fired pizza was so fantastic! Thumbs up for the nice management staffs for making our dinning experience wonderful . üòäüòâ
5
A very authentic atmosphere. I felt like I was in Italy. The food was well worth the money and I would not have mind if it was more expensive. I really liked a Burrata and the Wagyu Steak.
5
The tagliatelle was top notch, and so was the pizza boscaiolla. The ambiance was absolutely perfect.
5
I really love spaghetti vongole & the pizza salame. (Excellent pizza with homemade salame)
The staff is friendly & attentive. üëçüëç

Giovanni and his wife offer a 360* italian experience - something hard to find in this part of the world. Almost everything comes from our homeland: genuine ingredients, cooking style, warm and sophisticated hospitality.Feels like being back in Italy!Polpo mozzarella salad is top notch, as well as matriciana with original pork cheek! but the whole menu is just yummy!Will keep coming bac

With my family, six of us, we had dinner at La Forketta the other night and it turned out to be the worst experience in our life. The staff is poorly trained, the restaurant could do with a coat of paint and a better air conditioning but it is the food that really kills you. They have absolutely no idea on how to prepare Italian meals. I have been coming to Singapore for the last 30 years at least twice a year for a couple of weeks combining business and pleasure, staying at Shangri-la Hotel and will be back in February for the Air Show and will tell all my friends in the aerospace business to avoid La Forketta, Bad food and service at a very high price!! On the opposite, the Waterfall Italian restaurant in Shangri-La is absolutely heaven with Chef Marco being a great cook and a fantastic host finding time to come and talk to the clients. Keep up the good work Marco, you give Italian hospitality and food the image that it rightly deserve.Sergi

Ordered a Pizza Margherita and was really gooooodüëçüèª crispy thin crust and all the ingredients are fresh and very tasty! service is great! kudos to the managementüëè
4
Had a friend brought me their Margherita last week. Was only able to eat it the day after. Surprised that the sauce still tastes fresh like its just been made.

If you love pizza, I think the woodfired pizzas at La Forketta Dempsey are the best in Singapore! Lots of choices, as well as pastas, salads and so on.
1
Went for lunch with family. The manager, a young women with a strange accent was poorly trained. Asked if we can speed up the food, she replied it is first come first serve (?)( doesn't answer my question). Asked if we can get fresh plates for our pizza to share, she replied we should use the plates with olive oil on it used earlier for our bread. Horrible service, no more visits!

I went to dinner last week at La Forketta and have had one of the most disappointing restaurant experiences of my life. I have never written a restaurant review before but felt that I had to after my experience at La Forketta. A friend and I ordered the "ragu' which arrived as five small pieces of tough meat on top of the pasta. As I was with people who I had only recently met I did not want to make a scene and send the food back but I should have - the meat was tough and tasteless and in no way resembled the "ragu' on the menu. The $12 salad was tiny and unimpressive, the calamari we ordered as an entree was stringy and oily. On top of this the service was very inattentive despite the restaurant being practically empty, the waitstaff were not proactive and it was impossible to get their attention. I was very disappointed and in no way could I recommend this restaurant to anyone for the above reasons
1
After many years going to La Forketta, I have come to the simple conclusion that the food is great (excellent pizza), the ambience good, but the front of house awful. The serivce is slow, disorganised and no-one seems to be actually leading front of house. The staff are poorly trained and managed and, to me, it is the owner(s) fault. You have to have lots of time and patience when having a meal here, which is not a ringing endorsement. Doubly so when they are charging such high prices
5
We just had dinner at La Forketta and tried the spaghetti carbonara. As we are avid fans of carbonara we always order a carbonara whenever we are in an Italian restaurant all over the worldThis evening the organic pasta with the pig jowl carbonara was superb, it was al dente, the cheese, texture and consistency were all so perfectly done, it's truly the best carbonara we have had in our travels all over the world.Excellent La Forketta!
2
- Food was overpriced(4 pastas + 1 lasagna + 1 slice of cake + 2 ice creams + a beer totalled $300++)- The restaurant was 60-75% full when we arrived at 1pm on Saturday but food took about half an hour to arrive- When we took out a $1K bill to foot our $300+ bill, the restaurant did not have $600+ cash in their till for change (we assume they would charge about $100+ for every 2 diners on average based on our bill and online feedback, and based on the lunchtime turnout that day they should not have a problem with this).- Service in such a upmarket restaurant was surprisingly not too good, with undertrained staff placing our orders with the kitchen without completing and confirming our orders (they just walked away after taking one order from us before the rest could continue giving theirs)- The manager on duty though was polite and friendly and his apologies on the abovementioned made us feel a little better about our dining experience.Overall, we are unlikely to have a meal there again
3
Read the reviews, looked like a mixed bag - you either love it or hate it.Nonetheless, a friend recommended it so I just went along.Bread basket was good.Pizza was interesting and ingredients were fresh. Personally didn't like the crust, as it was a tad too soggy. Crust was also an odd mix of the thin crust variety and a little thick at the edges. Would have preferred thin and crispy/slightly burnt at the edges.Carbonara used the right cheese and pancetta. However the spaghetti was too thick and too bland. Could do with seasoning the water for the pasta abit more. It was al dente though. The egg flavour also didnt come through enough.Service was ok - some staff were more experienced than others, but it was not nasty.Overall I felt for the price - 30 dollars and up per main, I expected better
1
Seafood pasta was undercook, but restaurant manager said it's the real al dente standard for pasta but i dont think so & seafood smelI not good/ stink. Then we requested to cook it more longer for another 2 pasta. It come out carbonara really really too salty n and another one so so. Just the pizza is good n standard
4
They have very good pizza, and the set meals are value for money. In all would say the food is great.
5
Excellent Food.
Really enjoyed the food, ambience.
Waiters were very polite and seating was fast. Props!
1
Charge even the bread without asking the customer...
No wonder with this kind of service and funny charges, that this place is empty !
4
My 2nd time here - this time for a family celebration. The new waiter was nervous, but quickly supported by management to get things right.
really good food again. My 'go to' place for a nice night.
4
If your looking for a relaxed atmosphere to eat great Italian, this is the place in Dempsey!The food is of top quality with chefs that obviously care about the produce the use, as the taste was spot wonderfully fresh as was presentation.The homemade pasta was sublime, especially the Japanese pumpkin ravioli, delish! They also offer a carb free alternative of a zucchini lasagne, good menu selection and great to see a few options for vegetarians.Apart from the food, the service was impeccable, great staff and frankly the best service I have had in Singapore for a long time.We went during the week so not overly crowded, so perfect for a business dinner and a relaxing night. Thanks again La Forkett
1
THE WORST EXPERIENCE of the Italian food in Singapore!!The dinner was just spoiled!Survice was very slow ,with the forgetting to bring even cutlery!Drinks was served only after 50 minutes.Forget to give even side dish for the main course! I heard word "sorry" around 20 times for the evening .Will never back there ,will not recommend to go.Service bad,food overpriced for this kind of quality.Go at your own risk 
3
My children and I had lunch at La Forketta on Sunday. With the minimum price for a glass of red wine at $25 you would expect something above the average but it wasn't. Our meals all came at different times and the lights kept being turned up and down. I also felt like the staff were rushed making me think they had a lot of bookings coming in because there were not a lot of us there whilst we dined. The pork dish has changed and is a lot smaller than last time. I thought it was overpriced
4
Very good food, La Forketta never misses in that department. There were a couple of weird issues service wise however, which were a little surprising. When we asked for balsamic and olive oil for example, the server came over with two thimbles full of balsamic and olive oil respectively, which made it hard to actually use as a dip. The gin and tonic I ordered came with a whole can of tonic, which a server had unceremoniously dumped into my glass when I was about 2/3 of the way through, making the rest of the drink undrinkable. Maybe I'm churlish to complain but it's just weird issues which annoy me, but may not affect others. Food wise, all the pasta is perfectly cooked though the saucing on mine was a bit less than I prefer, the chicken was tasty as well, and the pizza was good (made for great leftovers!), my Mom's rigatoni with bolognaise was also very good
3
Its been like more than 10 years since we last ate at LF. Their location then was at Valley Point along River Valley Rd before they re-located to their present 2 locations- Nassim and Dempsey. We tried: a lasagna, one pasta (in tomoto and chilli oil), deep fried squid rings, one pizza and a grilled free roaming chicken (LF's version of our kampong chicken!) and a steamed spinach. Everything was very good except we had to wait a bit longer for our food as it was a Saturday - and the stove for pizza had limited space and also the chef wanted to make sure every order was cooked to the best standards and expectations. It was a late dinner at around 845pm (we were seated at around 8). But its fine as we always use the family dinner times during the weekend to catch up with one another. The food overall is ok. There was no room desserts after that otherwise we would have tried the tiramisu at the minimum. What's the most expensive item that we had - bottled still water...!!!. Ambiance was nice and comfortable. Service was good and the staff were friendly. The waiter took time to engage us in some friendly conversation and that when we shared our first visit was to their Valley Point restaurant. He said LF has been around for awhile and not many restaurants can last this long in these days - so there must be something good about LF as its success factors. Can consider coming back for another visit but not sure about having water on the next visit though.FYI, one needs to drive as Dempsey is not accessible by public transport. Parking at Dempsey is easy and convenient even on a Saturday night
4
The service by the staff was excellent. No complaints at all. But when it comes to food, they are quite badly done and definitely not worth the high price. To sum it up, too much oil, too much carbs relative to the ingredients (e.g. Loads of pasta with just a bit of mushrooms), pasta was hard instead of al dente, spaghetti was so thick it looked like udon, tiramisu was overly creamy, clams were sandy. One entree, one main, and one dessert for sgd33++ is too expensive for that sort of standard and ingredients. However, the excellent service from the staff and manager made up for our lunch experience at the restaurant. And Either the air con was faulty or the place we were sitting at had no access to it, it was really warm
2
Excellent location, horrible service and super dull food. I do not recommend. If in Dempsey there are far better restaurants to choose from.
4
A fabulous pizza place in the heart of dempsey. Sit out under the stars while you eat. Perfect for a romantic dinner.
1
Absolutely not worth it. Spaghetti was not so dente, clams not fresh, portions were small and they charge for a bread basket. A bottle of mineral water is $10!
3
Food was rather expensive but it was good. Great atmosphere to dine in as well. Service was good as staff were friendly.
1
I won't be back to La Forketta; but where do I start?The service is disinterested and poor. The food is worse than ordinary.The wine list is uninspired and basic. But worst of all, the food is served as it's prepared, so we literally had three meals delivered at staggered times and we were almost finished before the fourth meal was delivered. This isn't just unprofessional, it's sloppy....and on an island with so many amazing restaurants...and on Dempsey, that has so much to offer...it's just lazy. Don't waste your time.
2
La forketta is the restaurant I always freuquent. However the last visit I went was terrible, manager was not flexible enough even though it was my mistake to overlook on the cheese that I couldn't take. She had a snoobish attutidue too and just keep insisting I should just order another pizza, all I just need the cheese to be remove. Nevertheless this will not deter me from eating here again
2
Food was pricey for what it actually was. We ordered 5 starters for 7 of us and specifically said we were sharing but it wasn't starters that you could share (2 pieces of small bruschetta for $15?!!!!!) At the end of the night, we still still bubbles in our glasses but we're advised to leave as they were closing. It was 10.30pm on a Friday night
2
Passed this place a number of times on Dempsey Hill and thought we should try it out. First shock was the pricing. OK, high, even by Singapore and Dempsey standards. But hey, the food must be spectacular, right? Nope. Very, very sub-standard. We ordered Risotto and Lasagna...just plain bad. Been simpler and MUCH cheaper to get it at Cold Storage. Service average at best...not horrible...just expected better. Place was clean, and somewhat of a nice atmosphere, which is why this was a 2 rating and not a 1. Too many other choices around to bother with this place
5
Pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the food. The service was a little haphazard at one point with more than one waiter trying to serve us,but cannot really complain. Excellent wine list, amazing woodfired pizza and my lasagne was amongst the tariest I have had.
5
They have one of the best pizza menu one page long. Very interesting ingredients used as well. I had the Grilled Octopus for starter. It was the best I have tasted as it was very soft and not chewy. My companions had different pizzas and they varied from normal tomato to non-tomato based. The best was their homemade Vanilla ice cream!
3
It was surely quite expensive for the food served. Was expecting the pizza and risotto to be much better.
3
Good food at crazy high prices. My dinner companion stated the SE rvice was atrocious and I must agree with her.
5
This is the first time I been to La Forketta Dempsey. The ambience is beautiful, high ceiling & spacious. Excellent service, very attentive waiters. Food are superb, fresh & hot. It's a great place to catch up with friends.
5
This restaurant has a very good atmosphere and the food is also delicious. The taste of the food is totally an authentic Italian cuisine. It's highly recommended for people who go to Dempsey hill for lunch or dinner!
2
La Forketta is located in a beautiful area of Singapore in a heritage building. The ambience is amazing. The service however is shocking. After we settled down at the table we waited for over 10 minutes for a waiter to come and say hello. I went inside and asked them if we were going to get service or just come there to chat.It was a table of 8 with 6 adults and 2 children. Since the kids were hungry we ordered their food first. It was a pasta which should not take more than 30 minutes to make.When I checked about their meal I was told that it is not a fast food joint and we have to learn to wait. ( Well I guess we were not paying fast food prices either)My son ordered a Pasta and asked them if they could use Linguine instead of Spaghetti pasta. " NO SIR" came the quick reply. We cannot , sorry cannot do that.My son asked if they had Wi Fi and it was a rude " NO"The food was Ok but the service horrible. I did mention it to the management and they just smiled and ignored.There are other Pizza places which are better with good service!!
2
We requested a penne arrabiata and spagetti aglio olio, arguably the most basic of Italian meals. The arrabiata was essentially pulped tomato without salt, pepper, basil or indeed garlic and chili. Not quite sure what the aglio olio was! Regrettably the owner who was hanging around did not care much about the immediate feedback from his diners. Shame. Forget that there pricing is 20% higher than comparable Italian restaurants. Little wonder that the place was empty on a Friday night
4
I know this restaurant La Forketta from my friend's recommendation and I totally agree with them. We (couple) went there for a dinner and the restaurant is so romantic (they have roses in each table) and cozy. The staffs who attend us are friendly. Personally I think that the price I pay is worth for the food and their services. Love it 
5
I tend to visit La Forketta Italian Restaurant, they have a peaceful and romantic ambiance, very awesome and attentive staff. Aside from the fact that they serve the best tasting food that everyone would love and enjoy! I am not writing this review for the sake of its restaurant but for everyone to experience what I have been. Two thumbs up for this place
5
I have been to this place once and it was an unforgettable experience. The place is very classy situated in a tranquil lush area of Dempsey.The set up is very impressive and service is awesome! Not to forget about the lavish food and exquisite way of serving them! The staff are friendly and always ready to serve with smile:)Highly recommended to have a nice and relaxing dinner or lunch! Keep up the good job! I will surely come back soon! cheers!
1
The worst Italian food I had so far in Singapore. I even found some extra proteins with antennas in my salad. When I asked for the Chef to show him the insect he did not come out of the kitchen... the manager told that he can't speak neither English, Nor Italian ...(Italian restaurant..)On the positive side the restaurant has a quite nice architecture. Did not taste the Pizzas that look ok (after all the heat of the oven would kill the insect right? :)
3
Warm Chocolate Cake was disappointing. Not warm at all....
Risotto was totally tasteless.. probably if you are sick and it will be tasty like when bland food tastes actually good when one is sick ?
Saving grace was the calamari, pizza and bread basket.
5
This restaurant offers comfortable atmosphere and excellent service. The food is amazing although it is a little overpriced but it's totally worth it. Highly recommended!
5
I really enjoyed my dinner in your restaurant, the quality of food is high standard aswell as the service. The ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant was so romantic. I proudly recommend la forketta restaurant with all of my friends and relatives.:-)
4
great italian food though abit overpriced, however the impeccable service from our waiter makes up for it, together with the ambience.
1
Service is slow and non interested. Had a risotto with shrimps, could not find the shrimps and looked more like a rice soup with some weird sauce on top. Had one bite and they even did not ask what was wrong. Charge +30sgd for plate without shrimps. Can not recommend this place and will not come again.
4
Pizza is probably the best in town but unfortunately the service is not.It is not acceptable that in a table of 8 friends, the last two pizzas arrive when all the others have already finished to eat. If you go out with friends, you want to eat together!!
2
Was in Dempsey and went for Sunday lunch as other restaurants I wanted to go to were full. The place was virtually empty. Good service, reasonable but not great food but they have got the price point completely wrong( explains why empty). I left feeling that it was just incredibly bad value for money and will not return
3
My friends and I went here on a Saturday evening. The ambience was relaxing, the waiters attentive. I actually enjoyed my sourdough pizza, and my friends enjoyed their salads and pasta. Until we got the bill. Firstly, we don't mind paying well for good food and we are friends who go seek out fine restaurants to try out upscale dishes. However, being deceived is another matter. As we are used to getting free bread baskets in typical Italian restaurants, the offer to have a bread basket from the waitress elicited a "Sure!" from all three of us. We were not in any way or form asked or informed that the bread basket was not free. When we saw the bill, we were charged $6.50 for what looked like leftover pizza and slices of bread. When confronted, the waiter quietly mentioned that if they had to tell the customers that the basket was not free, customers would not order it. What kind of dumb policy is that? I rarely post negative reviews but consider it a duty to inform management so that they can change and improve their service, and second, to ensure that other diners like me are warned of this practice.So despite my love for their sourdough pizza, I will go elsewhere next time
5
We were looking for a good place to have our dinner, was craving for Italian food. The restaurant outlook is great nice ambience & music. Tables are well prepared & clean. We decide to ordered our appetiser which Burrata Con Pomodorini & Insalata Primavera it was very good starters, for my main course I ordered Tagliatelle Con Ragu "fabulous" Wagyu pasta and for my husband he ordered Pizza Crudaiola great meal, both dishes are not bad. Staff were attentive and friendly. Price reasonable with fast serving food even peak hours. We experienced good service so I guess we are luckier than those who didn't get it. Will definitely come back

It was my first time visiting Singapore and it was really a beautiful country. when i was there i was thinking to explore a lot of tourist spots and of course for their food, so i decided to search for a restaurant to dine with. So i saw "LA FORKETTA" in Dempsey Hill, when i arrived at the restaurant the ambiance was very "Alluring" which i really like and it satisfy me to eat there and try whats on there menu. Oh and even the host's are very friendly and communicative they even all have smiles on their faces. One of the host's hand over the menu and everything in it is very tempting feels like i wanna order everything, coz' i really love Italian food. So first i tried their salads for starters which is "Impepata Di Cozze E Vongole", and for main course i ordered "Bucatini All' Amatriciana". All i can say about the food is very "Appetizing" the presentation oif the food is very they must have the greatest chef in the world in their restaurant, it's the best i ever had it's been years since i had Italian food again. I highly recommend all the food lovers to come and dine in "LA FORKETTA" food might be pricey but the value of the food is very worth it. I wanna say thank you to all the staffs of "LA FORKETTA" in Dempsey Hill, 100% i will come back and dine in your restaurant when i travel back to Singapore
2
Okish quality, but really overpriced, even for Singapore, and for the poor service we had. Took to long to be served, although they did not have more than 3 tables occupied. Many other better Italian restaurants in town
4
Homemade pizza and pasta, very Italian, fresh and delicious. The service is really good. Nice setup that you feel relaxing. May not be very suitable for kids, but we brought our 5-year-old in early hour and it was all fine. A bit expensive though.
5
This is an excellent italiant restaurant. Feels almost like being in Italy, foodwise of course ! Everything is freshly made, and the service is perfect. A very good experience. A little bit expensive though ..
4
Visit this restaurant for anniversary celebration. Nice ambience with great food. Service was great although slightly pricey.
4
we have been here a few times and are never disappointed. The food is good the service is exceptional and the wines and drinks are just what you need. The menu has something for everyone and really well prepared and tasty. Spend some time and Enjoy
2
First time dining at la Forkketta at Dempsey hill, as soon as we arrived they announce no veal available so we ordered lamp chop for 2, a bottle of borolo wine and affagato dessert with 2 expresso to end. Except the expresso which is run by the machine which is good , the rest is mediocre.

I was there for lunch with a couple of friends. As other reviewers have also mentioned, the service was really bad. The waiters were clueless and the manager was even worse. As an Italian restaurant, they didn't have Aperol or Campari. We had ordered 3 starters to share. They had the wrong order for one of the dishes and didn't even offer to apologize. We had to wait for almost half an hour for them to make the right dish
2
We've been here several times before so it was disappointing that the food wasn't as good as before. I had the lobster pasta: the spaghetti was hard/undercooked, not really proper spaghetti (too fat), and not flavourful. The seafood linguine wasn't very good either, although the serve was a generous size. For $55/serve, it was not worth it.The fried calamari starter was good
2
Waited 40 minutes for the bread basket, 30 minutes for a glass of wine-waiters completely clueless, disorganised, slow and un attentive. It's a real pity because the produce is top-notch and the food quality is really excellent. The ambience is pretty good too. I would only come here if I had a lot of time, a lot of patience, and really low expectations in terms of service
3
Waiter should inform when giving the menu what is not available...wether than waiting for guests to choose and the while taking the order finally letting them know what they have selected is not available. Also 4 & 6 years old kids might want to stand up a bit after a long meal...without disturbing the guests...so very rude to see waiters asking them to go and seat at the table. Overall for the price paid, service was poor. Too bad because food is good.
3
Nice location in Dempsey Hill. Good food, however, I felt that it was expensive for what it was. Particularly for lunch.
2
Helpful, friendly staff. Management did not allow us to either store or consume birthday cake, bought from elsewhere. Disappointing.
3
I really like the pizza here, but lunch for two will set you back $90 for two pizzas, a bread basket and water. Starters are $35- $40. Seriously, that is a COMPLETE JOKE. It's pizza, not a trip to Oahu. ....
5
I found the environment is very fantastic, it is very natural and the service here is quite friendly and prompt. The waitress will come to check whether you need to refill water or anything else or not. I feel very comfortable to enjoy food here!
4
Excellent food, but quite pricey. They charge for bread basket & water. Main courses are $30+ onwards. Starters are also priced similarly.
2
The main course is priced at least $40 to $60. Pasta dishes are slightly cheaper but still more expensive compared to others. I had tortelloni but they were undercooked around the edge!The dinner for two with a tortelloni, a salmon, two glasses of wine and a beer ended at $166. It was very unsatisfying

Took my wife and our son for lunch at La Forketta for Mother's Day. The restaurant was overwhelmed and service was very slow. It was 30 minutes after our appetizers before we had our mains and only after we asked. The food tasted good though ... just too expensive. The parma ham and mozzarella, fried clamari, and wagyu ribeye were nice.
1
Total disorder. Waiters totally lost. Need to order 3 times for olive oil, toilets very dirty. First we order a sea food spaghetti and just after 10 minutes they told that there was no more clams. Food took 55 minutes to arrive. Please don't waste your money. Food quality very poor and prices very high. Bad experience. Will not go again, for sure.
1
Never again! Staff barely speak English, service was a disaster, bread basket is payable, they dont understand the difference between still and sparkling water, the Tiramisu is a disgrace - and the place is outrageously expensive. The night before we were at Capri in Binjai - half the price, twice the value. The restaurant has no soul and it looks like they are just out to milk their clients. Theybwill never milk me again
4
Nice place for a date, pizza was ok but the bread was a little cold. Since we were the first few customers, the waiters were very nice in their service but was a little unprepared and didn't explain the menu to us nor check for our needs until quite a while
2
Not a good choice for good value
The homemade noodle is under expectation and pizza quality cannot match its price.
3
In Dempsey road,one of the richest area for night life in Singapore,between a lot of different kind of restaurants,la FORKETTA provides a decent Pizza fired Owen,the service was pretty slow when I visited and high prices for a simple Margherita.nice environment.
5
The service is good on the whole and there staff are helpful. The quality of food is consistently good. Really good value for money.
4
Been to this cozy place for many times & the bread, pastas & appetizer are always so good. I will recommend to my friends & relatives if they are looking for Italian food.
5
Pizzas and pasta here are fantastic. I have tried elsewhere and they dont compare to this place. Make sure you try it out

Went here on a Friday night visit and were able to walk in and get a table for 4 on the terrace. Nice location, fans overhead keeping us cool. Service throughout was pretty attentive but not overbearing, always a positive.Our group shared some starters, including a mussel/clam broth and a carpaccio. Both were very nice. The main courses we all had pasta of various kinds. My partner's spaghetti al vongole was stuffed with clams, and my borcetti with pork belly was a nice change. I think everyone said it was nice, if not spectacular. The only downside is pasta that costs $35++ or so, which is not cheap. We had 2 bottles of decent house wine (cheaper that the main wine list which starts at about $95 and goes to over $200) and sat happily on the balcony chatting for ages. A bill for 4 (without dessert) was just over $400, which struck me as expensive, but a nice evening.Happy to have tried somewhere new for us
2
We usually go to La Forketta on Sundays, normally as second option, after having tried some others, since they always have space available. True is that food is ok, not bad, but they charge too much for it, in comparison to similar places in the city. And the quality of service is poor. Despite they don't have lots of tables occupied, they take a lot to bring the food, and the excellence of the service is well below the expectation you may have on the basis of the prices they charge. Simply not value for money, sorry to say
5
I love this place. It's a great place to recharge my energy from a busy city. The environment of the restaurant is harmony, quiet and clean. It is a perfect place to enjoy meals. The service was excellent from the staff. Most of all the food is delicious and healthy. Great food, wonderful ambience, excellent service & good pricing :
1
We were looking forward to having lunch in such a nice setting. However, clueless staff served wildly overpriced average Italian food while trying to tout every single possible extra from the bread basket all the way needless bottles of mineral water. Also, the single, tiny container of grated parmesan (3 cm across) seemed like a symbolic reminder of management's overarching cupidity. Staff just looked forlorn as they kept on doing what they knew to be wrong: for instance, the waitress pretended not to understand that we wanted to order a scoop of vanilla ice cream with the (so-so) chocolate cake without ordering the full ice cream dessert (S$15 for 2 scoops).Just not worth it
1
we decided to try La Forketta and ordered a pizza. Price S$35 was outrageous. For sure they have great food but this was far over the top for what you get. Also wine overpriced. We not return to this place at all.If you want to impress and pay to much as a SNOB please gop there
2
Food was bad. Place were noisy because of a kid. Kid was shouting and making noise. Waiter did nothing.
2
The quality of the pizza is very disappointing. Tasteless ingredients and salty crust.. We had 3 pizzas with one water for 150 sgd ! Clearly no price for value, for italian food you can easily find better elsewhere. we will never come back.
2
Why have staff that don't speak or understand English? Poor service except for who I think is the manager. Pasta was below expectations of an Italian restaurant. Pizza is nice. Bottle of wine at $73++ is good for value.
5
Food is amazing. Service is very good. Price is expensive though. Almost 50 dollars for a risotto is unreal but pizzas and pastas are really really tasty.
4
last minute booking for us and what a pleasant surprise! Great food. Very polite staff and pretty good service despite it being a Saturday night pre- Valentine's Day. We chose the tuna carpaccio amongst others as s starter. Tasty and just the right amount of greenery. Mains included the mushroom risotto, lasagne, waging penne. All were devoured and freshly presented. But pricey but all in all definitely recommended

I've been in Singapore for the very first time last week, visiting part of my family.It was such a big surprise to find out a place like la Forketta, reminding me my beautiful country...Italy of course, in a very sweet and delicious way and attitude inside.Basically what I can say is that the way the owners manage not only the customers approaching it for the first time, but the atmosphere when you enter that door, the smell of the cooking and the kindness of all the staff is unbelievable to discover in a city so far from home.The food and the dishes of course are not only genuine, nice to see and excellent, but what it left me astonished is the philosophy behind them.The two owners, one managing the restaurant and the other master Chef , seem to have found the perfect recipe to recreate the original regional italian food in one of the most beautiful city in South Asian environment.Discovering the traditional dishes of South Italy in particular, the perfumes of the bread, the olive oil...everything...have jumped myself immediately in my childhood.So I really really suggest everyone, not only italian of course, to try and taste this magical side of Singapore, considering its avangarde and cosmopolitan spirit.Many many thanks to Mr. Giovanni and Mrs.Grace Vitale.Hope to meet you again soon!Adam HassounMilan

This place would be a regular haunt if it wasn't so expensive. But...the food is amazing. I still think it does the best seafood pasta in Singapore. Jammed full of mussels, clams, squid, scallops and prawns. The pan fried Sea Bass was beautifully done and an unexpectedly large portion. Plus a bottle of house wine and the bill came to around $S21
2
Not good. Two pizzas and three salads (water and one dessert) took us back 200 SGD. In my opinion the quality of the place and the service did not justified the price at all. We also ordered some Panna Cotta for dessert but had to send it back because it was sour!!. I cannot really recommend this place. Service was quite bad
5
I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for great Italian food.This place pride themselves with the freshness of the food which can tell immediately from the freshness once you taste it.The bake chicken was deliciously juicy combined with a good sauce and this have been always been one of my favourite choice .Not to forget their pizza, with the Ozzing cheese , soft and very well combined with the right balance of the dough , is awesome , I have never tried any pizza that have taste so excellent !Overall food and setting was great , perfectly meet my expectation 
5
It serves very nice Italian food and has a very nice and clean environment. The pizzas were very crispy and delicious. The vegetables they use are also organic and they also use glasses because glass does not have chemicals unlike plastic. It was a very pleasant meal
4
Attentive service and good spot to get your fill on good pizzas. We all shared a few meals and everyone was happy. Thanks again
5
Environment was nice,and service OK, .The waiter was polite and give us details on the food items .The food was delicious,love it .
4
Always a favorite. The pizza's are excellent. By far the best I have eaten in Singapore. The service is always great and the decor is modern and fun. There is always something for everyone on the menu.
4
my friends and I frequent La Forketta on a regular basis. . The food - fresh, high quality... I will tell my all the friends come LA fORKETTA
5
It is a amazing experience in Singapore. WOW!! So delicious . This is a must to try since the food and service is excellent. I order the Pizzas and Italian dishes .
5
I had a nice enjoyable experience, went to La Forketta with my Friend and we been welcome and seated .The waiter was polite and give us details on the food items .The food was delicious,love it .
Will definitely go back again.

We had Christmas Day lunch, and ordered directly off their standard menu. The fact that they were not fully booked should have been an indication that we should have opted for some other place! Oh well having arrived and sat ourselves down.. We did order bruschettas , pasta and fish for mains . Wine by the glass .. Service was ok .. But not warm and welcoming. Food was let's just say - ok! Nothing to go crazy over .. Ive had better Italian by ordering it home when we lived in Bangkok !!! And I must say they charge 5star rates! Recommend avoiding unless you are really desperate for Italian food , and have extra cash to spare!! It's money truly wasted!
2
The focaccia bread served was cold and the wait staff are not very attentive given that the restaurant was empty - maybe because there was a bigger group of expatriates seated on the other side of the restaurant and we are just table of 5.Even the pizza which supposed to be baked fresh was not hot enough. Plus leaking air condition - water droplets from the top
5
Oh my gosh everything and I mean everything is so beyond good and the service was just as awesome! This is the first time I was here, the food here are marvels~ÔΩûThey serve hearty Italian food in Singapore that satisfied my cravings and leave me coming back for more. They are using only the finest ingredients imported from Italy, we prepare fresh and wholesome pasta and cuisine according to authentic Italian recipes and serve with true Italian hospitality.We are looking forward to returning and trying more of their delicious dishes.Perfecto
5
In my top 3 for Italian restaurant in Singapore. The pizza is crunchy, cheese is top notch and the service is good^-^Service at La Forketta Gastronomia Italiana is impeccable, befitting a fine dining establishment. Staff will welcome you, and seating is done quickly. I like that staff are knowledgable on the menu, as well as the daily specials, able to make recommendations, including pairing of wine. Orders are fulfilled relatively quickly, and dirty plates are also cleared efficiently. They're proactive, offering to change plates after several courses. I also like that staff come round to check on your dining experience, as well as ask for feedback. Excellent! I really enjoyed this place a lot. LOL :
5
Good authentic Italian food and Service staffs are attentive and polite. Price abit on the high side.
5
Had a pizza and pork belly to share. the pork belly was flavorsome and the skin is very crispy. Pizza crust was crunchy and nice and thin and the toppings are delicious.
3
Nice place, decent pizza, good wine but nothing too special. The bill was a bit of a shock and would prevent me form coming back.
2
Visited for Lunch! Tables were available walk in while most others at Dempsey were full ( should have given us a clue! ) Food very average 2/5 , nothing special and I have tasted much better Italian from roadside joints! Service was average with staff not very attentive 3/5. The place is nicely done and ambience is good 4/5 unfortunately let down by what's plated out!
1
Outrageously bad. Firstly, we were told the starters were late because the restaurant was very busy ( only half the tables had occupants) we were then told they couldn't cut the pizzas and swap plates because, again they were too busy and then the aggressive chief/owner complained to us that if he cut the piazza, the cheese will melt out. - duh!!!Waiters got surly and dumped the appetisers, the we cancelled the night, tried to pay only to have the chief/owner threaten us the moon us - most bizarre and child like reaction. We deleted the 10% service charge (b/c there wasn't any service) and I thought we were going to be punched. Dangerous, obnoxious, poor service and rudeness. DONT GO - AVOID like th plague.I have the video of the chief mooning us (he must have been nearly 60) but kind of summed up food and the service. Out of decency, I won't post but needless to say, disgusting. All in front of my 80 year old Mother.Things have certainly changed and for the worst. Time this place closed down
4
A little hidden gem on Dempsey, this Italian has a great menu and the food to match it, our food was excellent and well prepared and incredibly tasty. They have a good little wine list to go with the food. The restaurant and service is perfect nice and quite and just what is needed to enjoy the food. Give it a try. Enjo

We returned here after a year because we remembered it being a comfortable place.We were shocked to see that the prices had increased 30% from what we remembered but we figured that the food had been pretty good the last time so we stayed.The service was prompt and courteous.Our Parma melon looked beautiful but it turned out to be tasteless.When our pastas arrived, I could immediately tell that the pasta had absorbed the sauce and it was going to be dry. When we started to eat, it turned out to be more disappointing! I know this restaurant uses TOP Quality ingredients but I'm shocked that any Chef would serve the food we were given and expect customer's to return.I wouldn't recommend this place!In such a competitive industry, it's necessary to deliver delicious items every time, especially if you are charging premium prices. Unfortunately, this wasn't our experience
5
Every time I visit Singapore I always come back to this place ... I should say my dining place at home away from home. Thanks for the very accommodating and hospitable staff that adds more appetite on their delicious meal that are being serve with a smile...Thanks for the wonderful dining experience, please keep it up we will keep on coming back..
2
.....we had to wait over 45 minutes for two pizzas when the restaurant was not even half full and we had to ask three times to the same waiter a piece of bread for our little one.....food is generally good .....Shame for the lack of organization, management and customer service.Its not the first time that when there are big tables ( tonight there was only one table with approx 18-20 people), the small tables seem forgotten totally by the staff.
2
We normally go to La Forketta Nassim but this time we went to Dempsey. Chalk and cheese. Service was slow and cold. On our arrival they had no clue we were coming even though we booked. I can thoroughly recommend La Forketta Nassim but avoid Dempsey
4
The restaurant is at Dempsey Hill which is easily accessible from commonwealth MRT station.
Pros:
1. excellent location
2. great Italian food
3. Perfect ambience for couples
4. Good service
Cons:
1. A bit expensive. Not much though.
4
The food was great but not very fancy. There was limited food for vegetarians but many options for meat eaters... The pesto linguini was nice and the non-alcohol drinks were great, the mojito being the best!
It was a good meal!
4
Italian food at very good level, pizzas and pastas are excellent. Enjoyed risottos as well. However, the place is overpriced, even for Singapore ($50 for a pasta seafood, really?). And service is slow. Nice ambience.
4
I wouldn't say la Forketta is really, really great Italian food but, its pretty good. They offer a wide selection for meat eaters but, as a vegetarian, it was pretty small. Its a great place for friends, families, couples.
3
I could say I was rather disappointed with the quality of the food. I order the clam pasta and ham pizza. Pasta was bland. I didn't get to choose the type of pasta I wanted, turned out to be spaghettoni which wasn't my preferred choice. Clams portion was generous though. For $33, I had almost 40 clams on my plate. As for the pizza, thin crusted and cooked just nice but it was bland. The sauce and cheese didn't help to enhance the flavour.Service was pretty prompt, however, lacking in smiles from the staff. It felt like we weren't welcomed. Ambiance was cosy. Small restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating.It was my first and last trip there, definitely

We went to Dempsey Hill for some shopping at Culina but then decided to wander around and find a place for dinner. We stumbled across La Forketta and decided to give it a try. The service was very inviting and attentive. We shared the Burratta as an entree which was simply to die for...elegantly presented with red ripe tomatoes, rocket and a little basil drizzled with olive oil (would have like more basil). For mains my husband chose the chill and lemon baby chicken.....simply delicious in his words. I decided on the roast pork - the portion was just right with crispy crackling skin! We order 2 sides, spinach with garlic and lemon and beans with tomato and parmesan. All simply amazingly good. Oh and I forgot to mention the breads......I try not to eat too much bread but it was hard to resist - Rosemary Foccacia - just mouth watering. There was also garlic bread, ciabatta and more but I held back at the rosemary foccacia. We order an Italian Red wine to go with our meal and that also was a nice accompaniment. All in all not a cheap night out but all the food is beautifully prepared and it is authentic Italian. I have to return for the pizza as they also looked amazing!!!
2
My family went with some friends to La Forketta for dinner a few weeks ago. It was highly rated by my family friend but my parents and I were disappointed at the service and the prices of everything. Firstly, they didn't allow us to change a dish that we ordered. They also refused to change the kind of pasta used in the dishes for the elderly who were with us. They charged for every bottle of water as well. And lastly, they hardly had much choice for vegetarians. I would never go back to this restaurant again.
3
Great atmosphere and love its setting, good choice to hang out with friends. Homemade Burrata is delicious, but in my opinion, does not come close to Mozza's. We shared a plate of charcuterie, served with honey melon - can't go wrong with this. I had the Tortellini Filled with Pumpkin, which turned out to be disappointing. Pasta dough was thick and chewy but the filling was delicious. Service was prompt and attentive however nothing wow. The service associates were efficient but did not seek for feedback after our meal.

My partner and I wanted a romantic night out on a Sunday evening. We decided to try La Forketta at Dempsey. Decor looks rather appealing. Ordered bruschetta, veal and tuna pizza. Bruschetta was quite tasty. Veal tasted quite well but the Parma ham was a letdown. It was so salty that I have to leave them on the plate. Tuna pizza turned out to be rather spicy with the chili flakes on it. I was told by the waiter that my veal comes with side dish. Selected saut√© mushroom which was too oily. Bill came and realized the saut√© mushroom was not free. The waiter should have told me its chargeable in the first place. We left the place with great disappointment. Waiters were not friendly, no smiles on their face. It's overpriced with such poor service. We will certainly not go back again

On a visit to Dempsey Hill to look at furniture, I walked around to see what was for Lunch, food anywhere up there isn't cheap, but free parking helps ease the cost.Lots of the usual players up there, but I felt like Italian again.I ordered the Capricossa pizza, and with the wold burning oven, it has to be one of the best pizzas I have had here yet. I was told even the wood they use comes from Italy!Bread comes free, fresh baked, and had a nice chat with Chef Giovanni. I will come back for dinner sometimes, and I hear it gets busy at night.Bella Pizza
4
This is the second time I come there, the food is good, service good and the atmosfeer also.
Its in a nice quite area.
I will be back if I am in Singapore
Bernies worldwide travel experience

Excellent Italian food - being a vegetarian, the greens are really important. The salads were great.. good selection of wine and delicious pizza.
5
Difinitely one of the best authentic Italian Resto in town, nice ambient with very hospitable and accomodating staff. I will surely come back to this place next time I visit SG, best recommended for rleatives and friends visiting SG
5
Was searching around for a nice restaurant around Dempsey Hill rather late in the evening and my girlfriend and I stumbled upon this place. First of all, the staff was extremely considerate. We wanted to sit outside as it was a lovely evening and the only seats available were right in front of the restaurant as the back section was closed. After we chose our seat the maitre d pointed out that tables on both sides were smokers (we didn't notice the used ash trays on the tables beside us) and he offered to relocate us to the opposite corner in front of the restaurant covered by a bush. Perfectly charming seat, quiet and away from smokers.We had the best burrata we've had in Asia and really delicious and perfectly cooked fish. Certainly will be back again and will recommend anyone looking for a good restaurant around Dempsey
5
To thank my friend for putting up with us for 2 week-ends we took him to his favourite restaurant. This place is not cheap but gives you proper Italian food. The breads on offer were a delight. Service was good and i would recommend this place for special occasions
4
We had bruschetta and burrata with tomatoes and olive oil for starters, and the tomatoes were so sweet only real Italian tomatoes can be. The burrata had the smoothest beautiful taste, a must for a starter. We completed the meal with various oven baked pizzas. Beautiful taste with a crispy crust. Everything at a very nice location. Two minor issues to be noted is that it took quite a long time to get the food, in particular the pizzas, and secondly it is quite pricey, 330 SGD for 4 people
5
You get exactly what you expect at this restaurant when reading the reviews here. Great Italian food. The best tomatoes I had outside of Italy and realized they are flown in from Italy. The food is extremely well prepared and the service is very good for Singapore standards. We went with a friend and truly enjoyed great food in a great seeting. We shared the buratta along with beef carpacio for starters - all hightly recommended. One had the seabass - this was amazing, one had the homemade pasta with seafood - loads of different and amazing seafood. The pasta with salmon was a little dissapointing in the sence there was not that much salmon, but the taste was superb. We asked for parmesan and had expected it to be freshly shaved at the table, but got a little bowl with already shaved parmesan. Desserts was the homemade ice cream which was good as well. Topping it all off with a true espresso. As mentioned the service was good for Singapore, the ambiance was quite nice and despite the little road next to the restaurant there was no noice or worries in that regards. Candles and just nicely cosy. Great to go there with friends or a partner. We enjoyed our food and can for sure recommend this restaurant
5
 I visited this restaurant with my hubby at dempsey branch last sunday.as we approch at the entrance an attentive and pollite staff assisted and welcome us. we tempted to try the burrata which was so good .it was soft creamy and delicious.it was fallowed by bucatini all'amatriciana for my main course and pumpkin tortelline for my hubby.both of the dishes are excellent,and the taste,presentation was deliciously unique. we will definetely come back as like the friendly staff warmly invited us to come again as we departed from the restaurant
2
Went with my family for a Sunday dinner. The Pizza was nice and very fresh, however we ordered a Creme Caramel for our daughter that was so burnt it was inedible. When we informed the manager, he told us we had no idea what we were talking about and the desert was fine. The sauce was so bad that it tasted like burnt sour sugar, the chef then also informed us we had no idea and to put up with it.Have been to countless italian restaurants and our daughter has never turned down a creme caramel, to say arrogance of staff is an understatement. Will definitely never recommend this place to anyone
5
Such a lovely place! I have been back to SIngapore a few times and every time I find myself back here. No need to travel to Italy to taste authentic Italian cuisine, its right here in Singapore! Beautifully prepared and lovely decor, yes its not the cheapest place but the food more than makes up for it!!! Would recommend to anyone interested in knowing how pizzas should be made
4
went there on dec.18 for dinner,the atmosphere was great and the food is fantastic. I love the lasagna it's delightful. the service is good thank you to the waiter wearing specs
sorry forgot to get his name.

It was my 1st time to dine in at la forketta and it was really unforgettable experience with my family. I did a right choice of restaurant here in sg. Bravo!!
1
Just spent 450sgd on one of the worst meals I've ever had. Food was not fresh and wine tasted like it had been poured from the remnants of left over bottles. It was my son's birthday and the restaurant was not busy (Tuesday night at 630pm) yet we were placed at a table opposite some foul smelling bins. Service was poor but food even worse, would urge you not to waste your money - there are far better restaurants than this. Shocking they get away with serving such bad food at these prices
2
Ordered the two course meal which consist of a choice of soup and a main. Waited fifteen minutes before I was informed that my choice of soup was not available. Was offered other choices which I was not interested. Hence, I requested to change my order from the two course meal to just a main. However, the waiter was unhappy that I requested for a change as he had entered the order into the system. The mains took a long time to arrive as well (about half an hour or more after the appetizer was served) which is a surprise given that the restaurant was not full at that time and all other tables have already been served their orders. A basket of assorted breads were available for customers' selection and I notice that the breads were offered to other tables multiple times while my table was offered only once. The food actually taste OK but the poor service marks this restaurant down. Not
5
You must try the buffalo mozzarella it is amazing. The set menu was great value and the portion sizes are large. The staff here are great. We had a booking at Chopsuey across the road and the staff were so rude on arrival we left and tried our luck getting a table at La Forketta. It was my birthday that day and a lovely lady at the restaurant went over and above to get us a great table outside. This same staff member helped us get a taxi home and gave my son biscotti while we waited to keep him occupied as Taxi's can be hard to get in Dempsey Hill.Top restaurant with top staff, thanks for a great evening
1
Went for lunch with the family. Our 3yr old daughter doesn't like tomatoes, so we ordered a plain boiled pasta. Was informed that the kitchen was unable to boil pasta - could only order items off the menu. Waitress helpfully suggested getting chilli pasta without the chilli. Menu mentioned cherry tomatoes, which we asked to have left off along with the chilli. Were told it was just cherry tomatoes on the side so we agreed. When lunch came the pasta was covered in tomato sauce. Upon enquiring we were told it wasn't tomato sauce, but rather cherry tomato sauce. Unbelievable that an Italian restaurant that serves pasta cannot serve pasta without sauce. Last time here for us.

After ten days of eating yummy asian food. A change of taste is a good plan and Italian food is allways a good idea. We went to La Forketta, because my cousin said that they have The best pizza's in Sing. And he was right. Pizza as if you are in Italy. A nice thin pizza with a good crust. Fresh ingredi√É¬´nts.
3
My friend and I was at La Forketta on a weekday afternoon. We made reservations beforehand. Service was prompt, we were shown to our table quite quickly. The restaurant was not fully occupied and the tables were set out nicely so that diners have space from other guests. We both place orders for the 3 course set lunches. I had the clams soup, spaghetti with mussels and chocolate lava cake. The spaghetti is not the regular spaghetti but udon. I thought that interesting, fushion - I like it ! Turns out udon was not well cooked enough and its a little hard. We had no choice but to sent it back to the kitchen. The chocolate lava cake is a little disappointing. First few bites of the cake - the texture was too soft and it only tastes firmer and right towards the edge. Overall, it is a nice environment with good service but I will try other italian restaurants. I left La Forketta feeling disappointed
3
We went for dinner and we ordered pizza and pasta. The pizza was delicious, the pasta was ok. The service staff is the usual Singapore standards: forgetful, mechanical, a bit lost at times. Another issue is the price: it is overpriced for what you actually get. It's a nice location but there are cheaper Italian places in town where the food is just as good
5
When on a short trip to Singapore my friend took me for dinner at this delightful Italian restaurant. The pizza's were thin-based and crispy, with fresh toppings; just how I like them. The food was hot, served quickly and accompanied by an admirable selection of wines. The waitress was friendly and polite and surprisingly knowledgeable of the food and wine on offer. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone passing through the Dempsey Hill area
4
Probably the best pizza in Singapore, their menu is quite good, however it is quite expensive. The service is excellent, the staff is very polite.
5
Went with my family and my boys love their Pizzas which is hand made in front of you. Delicious and fresh food.
Their service has also been good. Will definitely visit them again!

If 32 SGD for a Pizza Margherita doesn't shock you, this is the right place for you. Ingredients from Italy, Wood for the oven from Italy - casual, yet nice setting. Good taste.

We tried this restaurant and had a really enjoyable experience. The service was excellent, as was the ambience, and the staff were very attentive and couldn't do enough to ensure that we had a good time. My partner had the pizza and said the pizza base was one of the best he had ever tasted. For dessert I had the tiramisu and it was superb! Yes, this is not the cheapest Italian restaurant in town but it more than makes up for it with the excellent service, the delicious food and a good selection of Italian wines. The next time we are in Singapore we will definitely pay another visit and I would recommend this restaurant without any hesitation

We eat here often, especially when my husband is in town. Definitely the best pizza offered in Singapore and my Italian husband often says he can't find pizza this good even in Italy. The salami pizza is fabulous and salami home made and free of preservatives. All ingredients are imported from Italy, including the 000 flour, the wood fired oven and even the wood. Other favorites include the Pumpkin ravioli, simply tossed in butter and sage - delicious, Amatriciana pasta, which we ask for as a favour, burrata cheese with the sweetest of Italian tomatoes plus they offer a great range of home made breads, pizza bread and rosemary focaccia bread to start. We love the ambience of the outdoor balcony and find the surroundings relaxing. Always have a great meal and dining experience here

We went to this restaurant for lunch and the pasta is awful. The prices are exorbitant and the portion size ridiculously small. Ordered salad which was stale and hardly any Parma ham in it. The carbonara was overflowing with olive oil like it had been used to disguise the lack of flavor. Stay away from this restaurant is my advise.

In the heart of Dempsey hill, La Forketta is a nice place to get Italian diner. Atmosphere there is totally different from any other places in Singapore as you feel like in a little village.Quality price food; you can enjoy really nice traditional Italian food ; special mention to the pizza also recommended from an Italian friend of mine!Try also the pastries! Last time I could enjoy really nice macaroons

The foods in this restaurant is simplicity. Italian cuisine is great with just a few ingredients: tomatoes, oil, bread and wine, to name a few. Bruschetta, a classic traditional Italian food, is just bread seasoned either with garlic, oil, and tomatoes. Even a dish such as lasagne, rich in taste and smell, is made with basic ingredients: flour, eggs, spinach (for the pasta layers). Milk, butter, flour, salt and spice nutmeg for the b√É¬©chamel. And finally the Bolognese sauce.  Yet simplicity on its own would not be enough to make Italian food so delicious. Fantasy is the other fundamental ingredient. The cook here have the talent to improvise sumptuous dishes from an empty fridge. Healthiness as well makes traditional Italian food so popular around the world. The Mediterranean diet is famous worldwide for its benefits in preventing heart-related diseases

I have walked past here a number of times and just last week decided we would pop in for a late dinner. Had the set menu which I thought was good value (compared with the regular menu prices) and the food was lovely. It's hard to find decent, authentic Italian food in Singapore (IMO) and this was it. Everything that came was properly hot for a change! Clearly freshly and carefully cooked. The service was great and the wines by the glass are very nice. My only complaint is that they were a tad heavy-handed with the parsley - it came all over both our mains - but hey, I can ask for them to go easy next time, and I definitely will be back

In the 90's, La Forketta was our favourite regular destination for a good Italian meal (much like the various Crystal Jades and Imperial Treasures for Cantonese). Reliable, hearty dishes (including a great bread basket!) The food is still very good, and has more 'soul' than other mid-level Italian eateries (like Prego or the various Da Paolo's), and the owner still occasionally comes and makes pizzas. But although the cuisine remains hearty, home-style (with no 'wow' signature dishes), prices have galloped. At this price level, I'd rather pay up just a bit and go to a top Italian (like OSO, Otto, Osteria Mozza, Garibaldi, etc) and have an altogether superior dining experience

A group of us visited this place. We had to remind staff countless times to serve us. The food was very decent. But given price and service, we walked away disappointed. Hire new staff who are keen to impress!

$6 dollar soft drinks. $5.50 bread basket. Food was good but not worth the prices charged. Service was ok. Salmon pasta....the salmon was practically nonexistent. I had hopes for this place but I feel there are better options for the price they charge.

Restaurant is OK and do is the food. However price are very high compared to what you get. And on top of that they'll add 17% to the price on the menu. That said, it's extremely high priced.

Located at 9, Dempsey Hill, this restaurant has a great ambience, with indoor and outdoor seating. The service is great, staff are friendly. The food is amazing, especially the Tiramisu!. Don't leave without trying that.

One of the many restaurants in picturesque Dempsey Hill.The portions, prices and food are average. Ok for a casual meal but perhaps not for a special occasion.The tomato based pasta was a bit on the sweet side. Tiramisu was nice but panna cotta had an odd grainy texture

First of all is the ambiance is very relaxing, with good background music. The staffs are great that makes you feel very welcomed, a very good place to chill and relax.The food is worth value of money where the ingredient is very fresh, especially their pizzas are using wood fired oven to produce the crispy and great fragrance pizza, yummy

Rounded up a couple of friends for dinner at La Forketta Dempsey. Cosy ambience and really nice to sip some grapes with my raconteur friends. Service is so attentive such that the arrival of dishes were so well planned, we did not have to wait too long in between courses neither did we have to gobble up all before the next dish arrived. The pasta(s) are really great, done al dente and with just the right amount of fresh ingredients and seasoning. My friends had the pizza which came with a really thin crust making it really palatable and easy to move on to the next slice

Met a friend for dinner at Dempsey Hill. A location well visiting if you have time and want a change.It was a Tuesday, the restaurant was nearly empty. My friends said that the weekends it is packed out with a great buzz. The buzz was quiet, though the food made up for it. I started with the buffalo mozzarella, made the Italian, so full of flavour and so smooth in the mouth. My friend, she had a dressed salad, which looked, and apparently so good she would not share.Mains, a steak for her and heaven on a plate for me, the most marvellously cooked piece of pork, the knife just whispered that it about to cut and piece just fell on to the fork. Excellent, how it could it get better.Desert, her was a very nice looking tiramisu, mine however was the moist carrot cake, which was amazing, a proper perfect made English moist carrot cake in an Italian restaurant, in Singapore. If only I had known how good it was, I would have started with desert, and stuck.It was a really nice restaurant and if you have the time, even a little time go for the carrot cake and stay for the res

Overall I think this restaurant is average. The food first and foremost - my perception is that it is average. there were 4 of us and between us we had a chicken roast, a pasta and a regular pork dish. the 4th person had just dessert. and the last one appeared to be the best. all the other 3 while looking very good tasted very flat. the zing was not there. as a starter we had the ham and buffalo cheese. very difficult to go wrong in this one and to be fair, the ham was of good quality. the house pour red wine - the full bodied one was nice.the menu had a lot of options for the pizza. there were 4 pages on the menu. the first one was for antipasti, soup and salad. the third one was for pizza. the fourth one for drinks. the second one - this had pasta, meat and fish (the latter two without the pasta). to me it appeared that italian cuisine was too overdependent on the pizza section. i would have loved it of there were some more pastas available.the service was just OK. again no great warmth - no great welcoming smile and making you feel invited and important and nice - quite mechanical - no inputs / suggestion on the order - quite tired looking in fact. the decor is minimalist i would say. we sat inside. the table we had did not have adequate AC vents and it was getting hot. nothing that has the "wow" factor. cost wise 3 mains, one starter, one dessert, one house pour by the glass, one coke and one mocktail cost the 4 of us SGD200
