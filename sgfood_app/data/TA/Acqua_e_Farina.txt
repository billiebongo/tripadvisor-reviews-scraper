A nice place to eat at. The service stuff were attentive, the courses for the set menu came promptly and the food was delicious! Only thing is that the seatings are pretty close to one another, so if you need privacy, find it elsewhere.

Loved the white pizze menu items and pasta but since it had a ownership change. Things were well, not quite like it was. Can't put a finger on it. Still worth a visit once in a while but the ambience is different

Was recommended to try out this restaurant for authentic Italian dining, however we were sorely disappointed with the dishes. We ordered a Margherita pizza, and a Penne alla Siciliana. The pizza's crust was alright, thin and crispy, however the sauces on the pizza and pasta were definitely questionable. Not only were the cheese and basil missing, but somehow the sauces were watered down? The ambience of the restaurant was chaotic, waiters and waitresses were running about everywhere, it was noisy and not cozy at all.  The serving time was not too good as well, it took them 40 minutes or so to just serve two dishes. With the waiting time, and prices on the dishes this restaurant is just not worth the time and travel in my opinion

Combination of north and south of authentic Italian food with casual and relax restaurantLove their thin crust pizza (freshly, a-la-minute) and burrata cheese (with import cherry tomatoes) and dessert is tiramisu (moist and not too sweet)Ask the chef any daily special, sometimes they do have

Acqua e Farina located at The Rail Mall, 400 Upper Bukit Timah Road, Been of an Italian background, I am always on the watch for good Italian restaurants. The restaurant offers authentic Italian food from across Italy. The environment is relaxed and you feel like you are dining in a friend’s home. Food is very well presented and nice portions too. We tried several dishes that was on offer, all delicious with the real Italian taste, the highlight for me was Fettuccine Nere alla Polpa di Granchio, and it was to die for. Others such as calamari fritti, Sauté di Vongole, and off course pizza and calzone were all outstanding. Unfortunately after all that food we were just too full to try the desserts, which I'm sure they must be delicious, anyway I must confess it was the tastiest Italian food I've had for a while & it didn't break the bank. About the Service and atmosphere also get really high marks! Staff are very professional the service is excellent and very friendly and attentive. A perfect night, beautiful ambience and gorgeous food. Would highly recommend. I love it that much, I will be back. I truly recommend this place if you want high quality Italian cuisine

My husband and I popped in for dinner and really enjoyed ourselves. The food was delicious, unpretentious and the quality of the ingredients, excellent. It was Antonio's birthday and all the staff and customers were served prosecco and cake, after we all sang Happy Birthday to him! A charming end to a lovely evening

Ordered my usual favourites when I discovered that the previous focaccio- liked bread has been replaced by overly toasted baguettes! Brought it to the attention of the maitre d's and it was promptly replaced with a flatbread. My guests were really impressed. Made my dayI highly recommend the mushroom and truffle white pizza. Most delectabl

Not too sweet too

A bit hidden of Upper Bukit Timah road at Rail Mall is one of the best Italian places in SG: Pizzas are delicious, especially the Pizza Boats. Pasta are marvelous, so are various starters.There's a good wine selection. Do not leave without having the Lava Cake

I enjoyed the compactness of the place and attentive service staff. They are always ready to oblige even if you were to choose something outside the menu. I love the white pizzas especially as you do not find them readily available elsewhere.

The food was great and the service was good, although the price is a tad on the high side. Would probably do a takeaway of their pizzas/pastas/desserts in the future

Acqua E Farina is the transmogrification of Roberto Galbiati's well-known Italian cafe at Rail Mall. Roberto started the business as a cafe/traiteur: an ideal place to spend an hour or so with the newspaper, excellent coffee, and a piece of the home-baked lavender cheesecake (sadly, no longer available). On completion, one could buy some takeaway dishes from the selection on offer, to sustain oneself during the week ahead. Over the years, the emphasis became more and more on the dining-in business, and less and less the cafe. Today, Acqua E Farina is a fully fledged restaurant, serving some of the best Italian dishes in town. The pizzas are especially good, and for me, the best in Singapore. The pasta dishes are all authentic, and good. The tonnato, made with pork rather than the traditional veal, is a must-try dish. If you have sufficient space, the desserts are excellent, including of course, very good tiramisu and panna cotta. The list of Italian wines is as extensive as it is moderately priced. The service is prompt and pleasant.If you are looking for traditional Italian food at reasonable prices - this is one place that will not disappoint

I arranged to try out Italian Food and did a check online for a suitable restaurant. I found this one and ordered 2 different set meals. The atmosphere at the restaurant was really nice and the wall of wines on display really amazed me.The food served was delicious and decent. The restaurant staff were very attentive to the needs of the dining tables and to come by to help us clear the plates and serve the next dish.I really enjoyed dining there

This is a small restaurant in the middle of Singapore, i.e. Upper Bukit Timah. The italian chefs Roberto and Antonio have set up a superb restaurant with excellent quality and a wonderful service crew. Jhane and Janie read your mind when it comes to your wishes and they always keep a friendly face. Aqcua e Farina makes you feel like eating with your family and even the place is busy, which is in particular the case on weekends, there is always room and time for a small chat and a few friendly words. The quality of the food and the wines speaks for itself.Highly recommended to everyone who loves italian cuisine

Had a wonderful dinner and wine with my friends. Friendly and efficient staff. Both the Owner and Chef are very hospitable. Starters are of good serving size for sharing. The prawn and bacon is a wonderful combo! Good old creme brulee and tiramisu that you will wish to have 2nd serving. Good price point. Very relaxed setting. All in all, a good place to spend an evening with your friends and family. I like the fact that is it located at rail mall away from the crowded town area or Holland V.

few dishes to recommend:Fried calamari (not greasy / oily), Eggplant with cheese, prawn bacon serve with sautÃ© spinach, squid ink spaghetti (the sauce is black), 4 cheese pizza, mushroom + asparagus + truffle pizza, tiramisu.Cozy ambience, advice to make reservation in advance coz the restaurant is not very big and sometimes is full house

Efficient service on a Sunday night. My friend and I ordered a prawn, salmon and mango salad and Vongole as starters and had the pizza speciale as the main. I don't normally order salads at Italian restaurants but it was a right decision as i thought that it was refreshing with the right amount of interesting flavours with the seafood and the mango. The vongole needed a bit more salt maybe but it went well with the toasted bread. The pizza is highly recommended. I love the truffle oil with a very simple mix of cheeses on the crispy (but not overly crunchy like Roman style) pizza. I saw the other tables order pasta and the portions were huge, compared to another Italian restaurant in the Hillview neighbourhood. I am definitely coming back with more friends AND family.
