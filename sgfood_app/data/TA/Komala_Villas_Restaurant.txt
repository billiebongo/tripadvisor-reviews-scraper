For 13$ 2 persons lunch, we asked for the rice dish with veggies and they serve you more if you want, so it’s guaranteed that you do not live the place hungry!!! We liked it a lot, fast service
3
Had veggie taali food was average can do with more seasoning as food taste wasn't all that but prices are cheap
5
We went for lunch and this place was packed, everything we ate was great and reasonably priced. They are super busy though. Would recommend for vegetarians and vegans for sure! Right in little india too.
5
I liked this place so much that I ended up going there for breakfast almost every day on my business trip. The food tastes home made and is really cheap. Highly recommended if you like southern Indian style food.
4
Excellent food and good service. Choices are good. A smile on the face of the people behind desks and serving the food is welcome though not always seen.
3
Mostly south Indian food. Tastes good. Reasonable price. Went there with some Indian friends and they liked the food.
5
Asked for iddiapum takeaway. I really appreciate that the staff suggested I dine in as the taste and quality could be compromised if packed. Such honesty and caring for quality even if means a lost sale is rare. Top rating for service.
5
Good variety of South Indian food - the taste has remained consistent - rava dosa, masala dosa, uttappams! The meals are great value for money. The filter coffee is authentic..
Great pricing and good value for money
4
i absolutely love this place to come and eat but the main reason is the taste sometimes fail to excite me and enjoy the food. the pricing is amazing its totally fine to have a nice family lunch or dinner. variety of south indian food as well as others to cater for everybody.location is amazing as it is a very busy place.i look forward to visit this plac
5
The quality of this place is proven by the fact that it is full of locals every minute that it is open. The menu is extensive and the prices relatively cheap - by western standards at least. One may eat with fingers, chappati or spoons according to oneâ€™s custom. There are no airs or graces to this establishment - only good food, an extensive menu and a pleasant ambiance
4
This restaurant serves good south Indian food.Restaurant itself is not exceptional as far as the atmosphere goes but the service is excellent.We will certainly be going back.
5
The place was clean and the service was excellent. The food was like home made South Indian food. Would definitely recommend this place to people travelling to Singapore.
3
After many years we went there for lunch and has masala dosas and samosas.The samosas were not that tasty and the dosas were OK.
The food was not as good as it used to be unfortunately.
5
Went many times to this restaurant. Wide range of Indian dishes. Must try dosa and chilly idle at this place.
5
Absolutely delicious vegetarian food, extremely large servings so beware ordering too many extras! Gets busy so get there early for lunch.

Komala vilas R It is not a bistro; it is not a cafe; it is not a coffee-shop, it is not an eatery; it is not pizzeria; it is not a tea-room. It certainly is nothing of all that. And it is certainly no restaurant. Despite the label Komala Vilas Restaurant (KVR), it is a really a depressing street food stall but housed inside four walls, with an upper floor and of course a roof over all that. While a street food-stall may not provide much by way of seating, KVR does provide seating, and not too comfortable by any means. What adds to the discomfort is a team of aging (possibly past retirement age), sulky waiters taking “customer” orders. Their faces betray that sad, pathetic look revealing that they really are not interested in serving customers but are only there to get what little money they are paid by a bunch of undoubtedly very rich owners; KVR apparently started life in 1947 and it has several branches possibly attesting to the wealth of the present-day owners.My friend and I visited the restaurant one evening and finding the ground floor quite full, we were told to go upstairs. We did, and found a few unoccupied, spartan-looking tables. After a wait that probably lasted about 3 minutes, during which we looked around to see what was being consumed by others, an elderly waiter approached us. He looked unhappy, and we thought we could detect some sadness. My friend decided to have a rice dish, and with my curiosity aroused, I decided to have a paper dosa. For drinks, we both decided to have fresh lime juice. The rice dish arrived on what looked like steel dish or platter and my paper dosa, a rolled up pancake probably about 30-35 cms long also was served on a steel platter as well. Both steel dishes had slight recesses each of which contained a number of sauces. My friend expected his food to be served on green leaves and was looking forward to the experience, but that was not to be and he was really disappointed. We waited for the cutlery but it never came. How is one going to eat rice without fork and spoon? I was prepared to use my hands as others were eating similar pancakes with their hands. When we saw the waiter again, we asked him for cutlery. He returned with two pairs for both of us. But, where were the serviettes? We asked, and he went to the wash-basin and above it, was a paper dispenser for drying one’s hands. He pulled out some of the paper towels, really of the poorest quality, off-white coloured paper and gave it to us. I still had a problem: there was no knife and I had to do some quick finger acrobatics to cut the paper dosa.I did manage to cut the dosa into sufficiently small pieces with the spoon but it was a slow and tedious process on a smooth steel surface. I left two thirds untouched. The spoon could be used to pour some of the sauces on the dosa; the red sauce was really piquant or hot as was the yellow curry which contained some kind of beans, and which I now know, were lentils. The nearly white sauce made of coconut seemed to be the best tasting of the sauces, which I now recall, is a chutney.My friend who was hoping to eat out of a green leave said that the dish was “not too bad” as he had had eaten at Indian restaurants before. As for me, I had once had paper dosa in Toronto, Canada but it was far larger, perhaps 40-45 cms long --- was my memory playing tricks? That said, to be fair, I thought the paper dosa was OK and acceptable. Nothing to write home about, however.Both lime drinks had much too much sugar which took away the flavour of the supposed “fresh lime” drink. We were given a bill to pay downstairs, at the entrance to the place. There was a woman at the payment counter, and I asked if we could pay with a credit card. “No, cash only!”came the answer. She had an equally sulky face, like the waiters upstairs. We left KVR, not convinced that KVR was a restaurant by even the lowest of standards; the food may have been just acceptable in terms of taste, but we left with bad taste in our mouth, enhanced by the blatant lack of service; others may call it poor service. Ours was not by any means an acceptable dining room experience at what is really street stall but housed inside a minimalist building and providing a dining experience that has little to commend itself to others; if you want to experience bad or poor service in Asia, this would be the place to experience that. KVR wins my vote for one of the worst “restaurants” I have ever visited in all my travels. And that, in one of the richest countries in the world, Singapore! Sad, indeed!. The notion of service seems to be an alien idea in many places..

We want to little India . We stopped over at komalas. We ordered masala dosa , chapatie meal and filter coffee. The food was just plain with no taste. It was difficult to finish the meal. The taste of dal and aloo gobi was coming out the same. Just walk by skip this. There are many other good options
3
We came here due to TA reviews and we would not go back. It was packed when we went on a Saturday evening and locals eating so we thought it must be good.However it is not very clean or welcoming of tourists. We are from the U.K. and we were the source of much amusement to guests - we were not made to feel welcome and you are put on a table wherever there is a space which is fine but something to be aware of. Plenty of choice on menu and cheap. The food compared to others we tried in Little India was average and slopped out onto a plate or tray. You are expected to use your hands - again didn’t bother us but worth people knowing.We would not recommend or go back. Instead go to MTR - in comparison it is amazing.
3
Rated as a 3 because it did the job expected and we only had Appams (lovely) and some chai which for once actually reminded us of what we used to enjoy on Indian Railways. Staff were very nice. Surroundings are rather standard for a basic, cheaper Indian (fast food) restaurant but we would be happy to eat here again
3
This restaurant comes highly recommended by several sources, but did not meet the high expectations. The restaurant is not very clean. Service was ok. Upstairs opened at 4:30pm, and by moving upstairs we had a wider choice from the menu. Food was tasty, but not amazing. There were many locals eating there, which is always a good sign
5
Komala villas serve really good South Indian dishes, like the South Indian Thali. It is affordable and the taste is unbeatable. The filter coffee was also amazing.
3
I had heard good reviews but food was not as good as I thought. It seemed tasteless as it was prepared in bulk.
4
i am eating here atleast once visit in singapore since 1983. same taste of food and dosha and masala tea i always love to have it here.
5
Located in Little India Komala Villas Restaurant is one of the oldest restaurant Indian serving Authentic Indian Vegetarian Food in Singapore. Except very unhealthy toilets, the food is good, service excellent and prices reasonable. It is a low budget good food joint.
1
I visited this restaurant believing it to be the way it was 22 years ago , and was greatly disappointed. The ladies toilet was emanating a horrible stench, and the floor was wet. I had just returned from a one month stay in India and I couldn't believe Singapore has degenerated to third world standards. The tables were filthy and having the bin next to the table was nauseating. I was looking forward to a good Indian thali before traveling to Australia.I do not have adequate words to describe my disgust
2
Been there for lunch with friends one opposite to Mustafa center.Order one veg Thali and two Parota .Parota was good, But Thali was very worst above all very expensive . Curd was very sour , Veg gravy is very substantialService - looks like robot no smile in face.Not visiting any mor
4
You know when the food is good when a pkace is packed with locals and it's not even 10am. We went for an Indian breakfast on a Sunday morning and were treated to terrific food. I had the onion uttapan (apologies for spelling!) and my companion had pongal, both with marsala tea, all for about $12 Sing

I am writing a late review for this restaurant. i had visited this place one month back and was disappointed with the quality of food, and service. I chose this restaurant because the nearby restaurants were closed and komala vilas was only open until we stepped in around 10 p.m. They could have easily told us they were closed and we would have had gone home to a bread and butter which would have been more heavenly. After few minutes of waiting and when we were about to order the food they inform us that the kitchen is closed and all they could offer was a rava dosa and coffee. since we were too hungry and rava dosa was not a bad choice, we decided to take it . Unfortunately we ended up with 1 burnt dosa and 1 half cooked dosa that was inedible. when we returned the dosa , we could hear the chef shouting from the kitchen that he cant make anymore. Moreover, the dosas came in half washed plates (yukk!). The tables were untidy, the floor was filled with leftover and walked over crumbs and yikes i wouldn't bother wasting my money on this restaurant. I even wonder if singapore food safety dept does a check on these hotels and i wonder how they got tripadvisor excellence ratings.Rude staffpoor service(who serves coffee before your main dish arrives??!!)unhygenic(i suppose restaurants need to maintain a minimum standard no matter what time it is)Advice:if you need something to eat late at night, choose one of the 24*7 restaurants around the mustafa shopping centre. Atleast you will get edible foo

Hi,I had visited Singapore from Nov 16 onwards and finding good veg restaurant was priority. And after reading some reviews found Komla Vilas. every visit won't be complete without visiting Komla Vilas which has provided a great value for money and good authentic South Indian food. Enjoy your stay.RegardsGautha

Komala Vilas is a vegetarian restaurant which specializes in South Indian and North Indian vegetarian cuisine, sweets and savouries. It also has 3 other branches at Buffalo Road, Race Course Road and Serangoon Road.It occupies two floors of 2 shophouse units at 76-78, Serangoon Road. Business hours are from 7.00 am to 10.30 pm.The place still has the original shophouse feel and that simply adds to its nostalgic charm and authenticity. The dishes are priced very reasonably and are really value for money. Two of us ordered one parotta set (comes in 2 with 2 vegetables gravies) and a cup of warm masala tea each. It was a light meal for us. Total price was about S$6 per person.If you like rice, you can go up to the second level and have the vegetarian meal (which I understand is very reasonably priced too!). It is indeed a popular place for both locals and tourists alike. Great place to try Indian vegetarian food if you are at Serangoon Road
5
Eating in this restaurant since last so many years. Very nice service and yummy south indian food. No restaurant can provide such quality. Keep it up..
3
There is one across Mustafa which is smaller but better than the main komala vilas. Will not rate them as best. Have to be so much cleaner considering Singapore standards
5
Komala Villa is my favorite restaurant in Little India. Vegetarian menu offer many choices from Southern India. Food is so tasty and portions enough for big hungry. Staf is helpfully and kind.
5
A simple looking but best serving restaurant. Good for Chapathis, Dosa and other south Indian delicacies of veg.
4
South Indian food was very delicious and they are also very quick in serving on time. Good taste with reasonable price..
3
Good (and cheap) vegetarian food in a canteen style setting. We opted for set meals (a biryani plate and a chapatti plate). The food was tasty and there was plenty of it. The only downside was that as it is already prepared, the food was not as hot as it could/should have been. The servers are very generous with extra helpings of rice and sauces and we saw many customers making the most of this! This is an authentic experience and we were pleased that neither floor (downstairs serves dosas) was full of tourists (like us!)
5
I went to Komalas which is in ARCADE near the famous MERLION statue and within the business district having various offices. The food is typical south indian though you get a variety of other delicacies but the overall taste is very close to South Indian taste. Self service and eating there is value for money
4
Reasonably priced Vegetarian restaurant serving authentic south Indian and little bit of North Indian food items. Rava Masala Dosa was good and a cup of hot Milo was excellent. AC was not working to its expected levels and environment inside appeared to be hot and little uncomfortable. Food quantity was adequate and tasty. strongly recommend every vegetarian Indian to visit this place
5
This is the reason I come to Little India. The rice meal is exceptional. The palak paneer and Aloo Ghoobi are also delicious. I always enjoy finishing my meal by drinking the Masala tea. I have never seen this restaurant empty. Prices are standard for Indian cuisine. A must if you enjoy good food.
4
Many outlets, esp in the heart of little india.. this resto offers nice and simple south indian food. Nice ponggal for bfast in the morning till 11am. It also has various other dishes worth trying for the right price if you are strolling in little indi
1
Disappointing. Had heard so much about this legendary place. We ordered the veg meal. The rice was dry. The hot sambar and rasam were in carcinogenic plastic cups. The vadai was neither hot nor crisp. Enough said.
4
good food at amazing prices. very crowded, so reminds you of eating in India. must try. went back for appetizers
3
Had rava Sada dosa and friend had ghee masala dosa both came with sambhar and coconut and tomato chutney
Tasted ok
Butter milk was refreshing
Good while shopping in tekka for a quick meal / bite
Service is good
Cleanliness ok
Ambience non existent
5
Just went there for breakfast on a locals recommendation. Great samosas, lovely burfi and very nice masala chai.
Was like being back home in India
4
It was our first Indian Restaurant visit in SGP. Food was tasty and of good quality. Staff was not very helpful or welcoming but still it was ok.
5
A entire restaurant full of vegetarian options is usually an easy win for me, and this place definitely delivered. The food was really good, and the staff here were really friendly. The prices are very affordable, and the portions are large. The food does look deceptively small on the menu photos, so I ended up ordered way more food than I needed, but was very happy I got to try a little bit of everything
5
Not far from the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple is Komala Vilas on Serangoon Road which has been around since 1947 and its menu probably has changed little since. I ordered the thosai meal, and you'll get an extra-long, extra-crisp fermented rice crepe served with three vegetables, yogurt, coconut chutney, and sambar, a tangy vegetable-and-lentil stew, offered on a freshly cut banana leaf. Plenty for two people. The array of vegetables offered is a tour of diverse flavors and textures, it's an adventure trying them all. On another visit I had the Thali and was one of the best meals I've ever tasted, Tourists note, no knifes and forks, use your right hand only and bring your own napkins/wet ones.....watch the locals you'll get the hang of it
4
It's a busy place lots & lots of people coming & going with good option of food .. Tried Dosa & Idly. it was a delicious one i must say pretty Authentic South Indian Dosa specially its Cocunut chutney. Price is little high but one can go for it if they want a authentic mea
4
Went there for supper with my daughter and we both enjoyed it. The food is very good and tastes just like I remember from my trips to India.Staff does not speak much English so you are pretty much on your own, but it is very easy to order from the menu if you are familiar with Indian food. The patrons are overwhelmingly Indian, so can't go wrong!Less adventurous travellers might be challenged by the authenticity of the hygiene standards and the waiters, but it is in character! So go and enjoy.
4
We had a great dinner here, the food was fantastic and the staff was friendly and attentive. We tried the rice set, which had a few things we'd never tried as well as Chana masala and aloo mutter. It was all great. The only complaint was the naan was too small and we had to get extra orders
5
The restaurant is located very close to the little India MRT which makes it easily accessible wherever you are staying in Singapore. The food and hygiene is very good. Must visit place for vegetarians traveling to Singapore.
4
If you love Indian food then this place is for you. All South Indian and Indian Snacks like Samosa and Chole Bhature etc. you can get here at a reasonable price.Great food options and friendly staff.
Must Visit for Indian Food .
5
This is a no-frills, local establishment that serves DELICIOUS CHEAP FOOD!
Gives a real taste of Little India and gives you the opportunity to dine with all of the locals and not just other tourists.
So great we went back a second time :)
4
Komala Villas restaurant might be a little dated one,but it's one of the best South Indian food I had while in Singapore.
They have some great varieties and the prices are comparatively less.
Tips :try the paper masala dosa
4
Good service and food. Located in Little India serving vegetarian food. Had the chapati and biryani - both good choices. Best thing was the tea - excellent. Highly recommended.
5
Komala Villas having a very good atmoshere around with meals according to person's budget. All stuffs here is too delicious. Feeling very good to reach here
4
Bathura! When it came over we were awed! Hugggeeee bomb of crisp dough! With the crunch on the outside you wouldn't even expect the soft chewy texture when eating it with that lovely chick pea curry dip! Yum! And at a cheap price too! Komala's worth a visit if you haven't already!
4
Same Rava Dosa, same satisfaction in taste, speed and level of service. I didn't have to ask to top up my Sambal. Everyone knows what to expect, willing to share table for a quick meal. They can work harder on improving the cleanliness and smell of the restaurant
3
The food is good provided you are looking for Indian food in Singapore. It has both tiffins and meals as well. Nothing too special but not disappointing as well. However, my suggestion would be to really look at the cleanliness and ambience of the restaurant. The seating is too dense and experience of eating seems more like for the sake of eating Indian food and not for relishing it. As it is a family run restaurant, the service is good as they do personally look at everything and every customer
4
Yes It is not India, technically. It is just "Little India" in Singapore. But If sounds like India, tastes like india, smells like india, looks and feels like india... it must be india , right?Your senses and perception do not tell lies. The staff, the accent, the way their eat -what they eat and how they eat (No forks or spoons on the table unless you ask for them), will take you to south india.If you are not an indian food "connoisseur" the menu, mostly vegetarian, with pictures will help you to choose , and the staff will try their best to inspire you and inform you about the ingredients and tastes. Then... allow your self to be surprised.Important clue: Beware of the "spicyness" scale. Mild, medium, very or hot probably do not share the same meaning in your mental "tags" and in theirs. Their "mild" or "Moderately" spicy in curry , colud be a too hot to handle for your oversensitive gustatory buds -your tongue-.
4
Nice Indian meal while exploring Little India. If you're a light eater, go for one of the lighter dishes on the menu. The Mango Lassi was delicious. If you come solo, they'll help you find a seat because it gets crowded here.
5
Been to India and eaten some really good food and this was like being back there, amazing food whatever you order. Don't expect luxury just authentic homely curry!
5
Good service, good price, good quality and excellent food!!! In the center of Little India. A must in Singapore! Excellent place to have a typical Indian breakfast or lunch.
5
Crowded during lunch and rightly so... delicious, cheap, South Indian Thalia on banana leaves...both locals and tourists eat here..
5
must visit Indian place for authentic taste! South Indian food which just melts your taste buds. Plus the super filter coffee. The place is like a cheap eat but the quality is real good!! Would love to visit again.
4
Loved the restaurant, was really missing vegetarian Indian food. The place has a good variety of south Indian dishes and also a thalis. We were in a big group so ordered many dishes and all of them were tasty . The staff is also very courteous and serve with a smile. The only problem was they do no accept Forex cards. Otherwise a nice place to have south Indian food. The are a chain of resturants and also have few more restaurants in Singapore too
5
Started in 1947 and I grew up eating here as a child since the 50's. It was always an event when Dad and Mom bring us to Komala Villas for breakfast or lunch after shopping at Serangoon Road. Nice same ambience since I was a kid. I always reminisce the good old days Komala's had to offer traditional South Indian Food. Thanks for maintaining the old ambience with modern facilities
5
Popped in for vegetarian lunch.Went upstairs and ordered and paid at the upstairs register before sitting down with my receipt at a shared table. $8.50 for a huge Dosai Meal ( see photo) which I couldn't finish . Also Ordered a $4.50 mango lasi , which was wonderful and certainly not needed after my unfinished meal :)Go for it , you won't be disappointed
4
Love this restaurant, came here two years ago and had to come back the next time I was in Singapore. Amazing food, really cheap and friendly staff. Bathroom is terrible though. We all took light meals and were very happy about that, in this heat you don't get that hungry and then they're perfect size. Definitely recommend this place
4
This place is a vegetarian restauarant which lives up to its popularity. It is always packed with patrons, so Gard to find seating. I had the Masala Dorsai and Kashmiri naan with fresh water. They specialise in south and North Indian vegetarian cuisine, sweets and savouries
5
Never imagined south-Indian food would be so delicious that I would go there 4 times in a 5day stay! Fresh, Tasteful, great portion, fast and courteous service! Loved the dishes. If you are in Singapore, you gotta eat here!
4
This is one of our favorite places while travelling in Singapore. Great indian food. and value for money.
5
The food was really delicious. Even my husband who was not big fan of Indian cuisine was delighted. The only "but" is that they add sugar to mango lassi :-(
1
What an Un Hygenic place. I am not sure how this place couldnt even get any rating.Only staff seemed nice to talk to.Menu was dripping off food. Plates and Spoon were not clean. Tables were dirty.I would like the health team to make a round here as I feel its not clean and hygenic.The lady & old man, always smiling at the counter seemed to be ok with their setup as people kept coming to eat
2
Was there with my wife for coffee. Space downstairs was so squeezy and full, we walked the steep stairs to second floor. My wife took the seat and I was stopped to place my order at the cashier. Told the staff that we are here for coffee. Response was so unfriendly that 'only coffee?! Oh, you have to go dowstairs'. Told her it's full. Response - 'you have to wait then'! Asked her politely 'so we have go downstairs n wait though my wife is seated now at second floor and there are so many empty seats here?' Response - a firm 'yes!'Asked her again very politely - 'is it really correct for you to return a customer who is already seated?' Response - 'YES!'That's it! But guys, objectively, food here is great and I'm a regular visitor for almost 20 years
5
This is a Singapore institution. You can't say you've been to Little Indian unless you've at least had snacks here. All-you-can-eat lunch and dinner sets are a great way to explore the different flavours and textures Southern Indian cuisine offers but remember that it is only a small taster. The experiences of eating your meal served on a banana leaf with never ending train of steamed white rice, papadams, flour vadai, curries and other dishes is something any visitor to Singapore must experience. Meal comes with savoury soup/tea Rassam, yogurt to add to your rice, various spicy sambars, and a lovely ginger and sago dessert. Do note that food here is mostly simple fare and paying S$8-S$10 for just rice and vegetables might seem a bit steep but it is the experience that you are paying for. You can also opt for a vegetable briyani which isn't free flow but is also a decent sampling. There's a variety of fried fermented rice flour flatbread/pancake (Thosai) that are must-try. In fact, try them before you have any of the rice meals. Suggest the Masala Thosai (Potato stuffed Thosai) and Rava Masala Thosai (Semolina flour stuffed Thosai).All Thosai come with 3 sauces. A white coconut chutney, a vegetable and dhal curry and a spicier reddish/orange chili chutney. Don't be shy if you need to top-up your sauces the wait staff should be on hand to ensure you have enough sauce to go with your flatbread/pancake. Thosai make great breakfast food.Be prepared to dine with your hands and you might need a bit of practice. It is part of the experience and like learning how to use chopsticks. It is very ethnic and an absolute blast; they say that food tastes better when consumed with the hands. There are washing points around the dining areas that you can't miss that you should use before and after dining. Forks and spoons are available for the less adventurous. Avoid regular meal times and it gets very crowded. So aim to arrive before 12 noon and before 630pm. Snack bar, just behind the payment counter on the ground floor, is worth exploring. Dhal vadai with green chili is exceptional. Plastic packed muruku snacks are worth bringing back home as gifts if you don't have access to decent Southern Indian food. Do note that Indian sweets can be overwhelmingly sweet but are heavenly nevertheless. Take public transport as parking in Little India is a nightmare. Wait staff might be a bit overwhelmed and you might need to be a bit more assertive.

I an a complete food snob and think this place is the best south Indian eatery I've ever found, in Singapore or anywhere. I lived in Singapore for 5 years and tried them all, Komala Villas is the best. The food is fresh, delicious and cheap. It is crowded and noisy - but totally authentic Tamil food. The rice meal (which is a set meal) is the best deal, they'll give you more rice and side dishes if you want but usually the first serving is more than enough. Other classic dishes are iddly and dosa, the vada is also exceptional. I saw one review from someone who ordered naan and kofta and was disappointed: These are northern dishes, not what they specialize in so I am not surprised they were not good! Stick to the southern dishes that are their specialty and you won't be disappointed
2
We went to this restaurant based on their TripAdvisor rating. The service was quick. The price of the food was cheap. But unfortunately this was the worst Indian food I have ever had. I ordered a garlic naan because of a previous review but it was dry and bland. I also ordered kofta but it was pretty much inedible. The balls and the sauce were both equally bad. My friend who I dined with is Indian and was as disappointed with his meal as I was mine.Sorry but I wouldn't return
5
This time I had the Rava Dosa, a vada and cup of filter coffee. The staff were not overly friendly but were attentive and flexible. You just have to look and someone will attend to you. The turnover is fast, food is good and fresh, and everyone, including the customer seems to know know what to do
5
The chapathi thali was good. We could not finish the first rice serving and people around were having a 3 course rice meal!Buttermilk is an add on drink and was good. The chole batura was also nice.Sada dosa and onion uthapam were also nice. The sambar chutney, both were up to the mark. We loved the food here
5
The perfect Little India experience, eating with your hands a huge delicious dosa with very good vegetables. The chai was very good as well and the food came out fast.
4
Ate here for breakfast and wasn't disappointed. The coffee & food we ordered was all delicious! It's cheap which is a big plus, too. The staff was very nice & helpful. Would definitely return!
4
My first visit to a vegetarian restaurant and I was surprised by the quality and tastiness of the food. If you go at a busy time you may have to wait for a table but it's worth it.
1
Visited this restaurant on 26th June 2017 for dinner with my husband. We had ordered for rava dosa, medu vada and banana baji. First time in my I ate a soft rava dosa ( as opposed to a crispy one), medu vada tasted more like a bun, the waiter himself was not confident of the banana baji he was offering and asked us to taste and other the other plate. The accompanyments like chutney and sambhar we're also worse. Tomato chutney had mint and taste more like a mint chutney than tomato chutney, white coconut was super spicy. We had to wait for 15 mins after dinner for filter coffee that ordered in the beginning of the meal.As a tamilian, I would never recommend this place if you want to eat an authentic south Indian food in SingaporeThe trip advisor rating is very misleadin
5
Simple and tasty - standard Indian vegetarian meals for everyone. Visitors can go for Puri or the Plain Dosa. Cutlery is provided on request but do not hesitate to use your fingers to break into the various breads and the chutney dips.Complete the meal with a cup of Indian filtered coffee or masala tea. I have been coming here for over 12 years and have never been disappointed
5
Such amazing food at such a cheap price! We ate here 2 nights in a row and we were only in Singapore 3 nights! The service was amazing the owner came up to us a lot to ask if we wanted any curries or salads topped up or more drinks! The food was so delicious I was so sad to leave Singapore because of this restaurant! I could eat there everyday! For both our meals, naan and drinks it cost around $25 and there was so much food we couldn't finish it
4
My wife & I went to Komala Villas for lunch and had Dosa's. I had a paper dosa with butter while my wife ordered a plain masala dosa. The butter paper dosa was heavenly and crisp while the masala dosa was as its supposed to be. This place is a must visit & its also the cheapest good food you can get in all of Singapore. The coconut chutney could however be improved but at that price who is complaining

Visited here with friend and if number of customers is an indication of how good the place is then it speaks for itself. Really busy spot. Very friendly helpful staff. Vegetarian menu only. Food is simple but really tasty owner lovely guy and offered 2nd helpings. Cheap price. Recommended.

This tiny two storey South Indian style restaurant, on busy Serangoon Rd, has over many years stayed at the very top of my list of, must visit, eating houses. The rice plates, thali,s, dosas and general curries are just incredibly delicious. The mixture of sauces and vegetable preparations, rich creamy yoghurt and flat breads just gets more delicious as they all mix together. The rice plate is a culinary experience not to be missed for Indian food lovers. Always busy, reasonably priced, my recommendation is to squeeze in and enjoy
3
They have a standard, taste, fixed menu, fixed style etc etc.Dosa, Poori, Bhatura, Naan (during weekend), Kothu Parrota etc..All good and very consistent in taste.Little oily but I am ok with taste.Mod level pricy so for me economical.Decent hygienic . Service Super good.More than 1 time in a month , sure for my family
5
Here is the best curry I have ever eaten! Try sets and you could try different one. This vegetarian restaurant.
4
went for morning BF.Had masala dosa and coffee.Dosa was good but my wife wanted it
little roasted.I liked it.we ordered poori which was also decent.Coffee was ok
5
Food is great, although they're at short of Naan at that time. Not really something I'd expect but their snacks are quite excellent. Something I'd recommend if you're visiting Little India.
5
Place serves great pure veg South Indian food. We had the normal thali with Poori and Chapati for 9 SGD. You get what you pay for.
Taste is as good as in India.
Highly recommend p.
5
Had a great meal here... will definitely be back... everything coming out of the kitchen looked amazing
5
We have been going here past few years everyday for breakfast sometimes lunch as well amazing cheap food and really tasty
3
OK: It didn't help I went with someone from Chennai to this locale and myself experienced with Indian food. This is pretty basic. You order and pay with the cashier and take a seat. I found the food to be greasy, the dosa particularly slick with oil. The vegetarian flavor points a bit lacking. All in all pretty unremarkable. Prices are reasonable. Not sure I'd go out of my way to come here again
4
This was our chosen restaurant which served typical TamilNadu style South Indian Food. The Dosas were were very good but the best was the Andhra Style meal with Paruppu Podi and Pappu! It was at the beginning of Little India on Serangoon Road and hence very easy for us to walk from our hotel 'Village Albert Court'. The owner and staff are very courteous. This place can get crowded and hence you are to pay at the counter and then get a table for Food Service. That was the only improvement I could think of
5
I must say it has been a truly exceptional experience to go to Komala. The food was just great and the amount that I paid was super cheap. The owner is visible in the restaurant, and it has been really interesting to watch him how he is managing a high volume business like this. Even though he was very busy, I decided to ask him something and he took the time to answer the question and serve me the food personally. Highly customer oriented, great food, great ambience. I'm very impressed
4
Great value , tasty Indian vegetarian food. The usual choices, Dahl, masala dosa, chappatis etc Service was friendly . It was quiet when we went so nice and chilled . Could have been spicier for me and maybe lacked a little bit of flavour (some of the dishes) but I had my children with me and it suited their tastes.Would recommend it for a genuine little India experience
5
This is the first time i eat authentic indian food. I like the naan bread combine with delicious curry.
4
Nice, cozy, tasty food in the middle of crowded area. Food was good and we took take away too. It was neatly packed too. Neat restaurant in that area.
5
just go her eif you like the south indian fast food , great food , veggie and good service. I enjoyed a dosa but was too early for chaat as they only serve this after 3 pm i think
5
The hotel is too crowd and good enough as in Chennai National lodge. The food here is so nice and homely @reasonable prices. Located in the Little India it's easily accessible.
5
Same price level as a hawker - but in a restaurant setting. Very very good food, vegetarian food. Quick and friendly service. Would recommend to anyone who wants an excellent and cheap meal!

I've lived in Singapore all my life and I used to visit Komala's Villa with friend and family. One time, I was treated so poorly when I was there with friends from out of town, that we politely got up and left, but I vowed to never return. I had a friend from out to town visiting so I decided to try out Komala's again after 10 years. Bad mistake. Service is still rude, arrogant, and lazy.I had a friend visiting from the USA so I stupidly took him to Komalas. Not used to the heat. The man at the end of our table kept the water to himself so I reached over to the other table to grab some water. The staff walked over, removed the water from our table and returned it to the empty table. I guess empty tables are more important than paying customers. He did it on purpose to be mean and rude. He never came over to refill our water and ignored us the whole time we were there. We never got a refill of rice or dhal and were basically rushed out the door. There were no more customers for the day so he just wanted us out.We were not the only ones who had to raise our hands and wait for service. There are 10 staff members to each customer, but each is more surly, rude, and arrogant than the next. I think they treat the regulars with respect. Everyone else, they treat you like "we got your money, now leave." I left frustrated and angry, but I had to save face in front of my guest. I try to support local businesses, but Komala's Villa, I cannot support. I work hard to treat people decently and with respect. They work hard to remind you that they are an institution and that they don't need your money. It was like this 10 years ago, it is like this today, and if you look at the other comments on this page, I'm not the only person who thinks this way. Obviously they don't care. Be forewarned. You can get better food without the attitude. Stay far away from Komala's Villa. It's just a tourist trap now. Unlucky for the tourists
5
On our 4 day stay in Singapore, we always visited this hotel for our dinner needs.Even though, this hotel was at a little more distance from our hotel, we used to walk down for food. This hotel provides tasty Indian food items at a very cheaper rate. It is located in the heart of little india and is always crowded. You need to wait for sometime to get a seat. But, the food was very tasty and worth every penny
5
We had Idly and Dosai for lunch with lassi and teas poured with great flare by the staff. The food was amazing and very very affordable; the other patrons were great to watch too: the elderly lady next to us had fantastic filigrane earrings that covered half her ears. The whole experience was a real treat. Strongly recommended!!
5
I was 3 days in Singapore, and I was really tired of fried food what you can find everywhere. At Komala Villas you can find traditional real food with delicious taste of spice and home made atmosphere. Very good vegetable briyani with selection spice sauces. My favorite in Singapore. Highly recommend for everybody. Remember They are in Singapore a few restaurant with name of Komala. This one is on Serangoon Rd, exactly next to pedestrian traffic light.
5
So its our first night in singapore and we just wanted to get in the hustle bustle and feel for little india. We loved it here, pretty basic, but service was fast and food was very tasty. We had 2 mixed dishes between us and we were stuffed! So tasty too! We both ate for under 18 singapore dollars and just kept to the water! If we were going to be in the city longer we would probabky go back for a quic bite for sur
4
Komala Villas is popular amongst locals and tourists for economical Indian food of hygienic quality. The staff is very helpful but it is not the best food in Little India. I prefer MTR personally for South Indian food.
4
We ordered Punjabi food here. The time to serve was very high (because this is predominantly a South Indian resto). Also, the waiter had goofed up our order of rotis. The food was tasty and quantity was also good. Price wise this is decent.
5
Amazing food, easily share the biriani meal and the samosas were fab! The staff were friendly and service was quick. Would recommend 100% for a meal when you're very hungry! Good price for what you get, lush!
5
Mid range South Indian restaurant. It provides self service. Dosa, idly, South Indian thaali , Chinese and many more Indian meals. Must have filter coffee.
5
Vacationers. We had a great experience in this Restaurant. We wanted a quick and tasty dinner and got exactly that. The food was extremely delicious. Service is very efficient. The atmosphere is very busy (in a good way). 5/5
2
Make sure you have cash with you if you are a foreigner. They dont accept international cards which is awful. Their service was not great and lack of space did not do any good to provide a good experience. But if you are from Singapore you would not complain about space.
4
Was here for lunch and think it's a great place. The set menu we tried was ok with some great dishes but one somewhat less special curry.There are some really great stuff on the menu though. The spinach paneer is to die for. Go for that with a butter man only and you'll get a ab mea
5
This is a must visit place for those who want to feel and taste Chennai. Interior is intentionally kept rustic, creates an ambiance of a Chennai eatery, complete with menu written on wall. Food tastes delicious, the service is friendly and fast with reasonably priced items. When I have a craving for thosai, this is the #1 place i look fo
4
Looking for delicious Indian vegetarian food? Komala's villas is a good choice. Love the dhosai here, a wide variety available and free top-ups of any of its gravy. Their teh tarik is also well made; so do make sure to have one with your meal. Feel free tk eat with your hands too as there is a sink available for you to wash your hands before and after eating. Only downside, it is rather a small eating area so it is not able to cater to very large group, especially on weekends. Dont be alarmed when you have to share table during peak hours. Just enjoy your food and go
1
We visited Sunday evening about 4 pm. We were waiting next to the cashier at Second floor expecting sombody would guide us. As there was no one is addressing to us, i asked from the person who is appeared to be Chief Waiter"Can I order?" . Then , He arroguntly command me to order from the cashier. Then I asked from the Cashier "why he is shouting?" . I dont want to argue with him, then we left from the resturant as we wanted to enjoy meal not to be humilated. Whole evening was spoiled. Though I used to visit this place very frequently for last ten year, we will not visit again Komala Vilas.
3
Been here a dozen of times , Decent south Indian food. Can give the non south Indian dishes a miss . The filter coffee served was my personal favourite
4
Food is definitely good. Come here if you are hungry and want a good meal. If you love rice, try their Biryani rice meal. If you want Indian love, try the Chapati plate paired with a hot or cold masala tea.
5
This place was very busy, apparently it is quite famous! We went for breakfast so had idly dossi, very delicious! No frills or fancy tablecloths. ..... but if you want tasty and value for money it is great!
4
Excellent place to have cheap South Indian Food. Ambience is not very great but staff are very good and service is prompt
4
Food is really delicious and so cheap.Also vegetarian friendly and vegan :)
Only one down side is not very sure how hygiene it is.
4
This is a no frills, pocket friendly restaurant at the heart of Little India. The food portions are good, its authentic and great for budget travellers looking for Indian food. The service is slightly laid back but the food makes up for it. Must try
4
Best Dosa's I've ever tasted. Crowded at lunch. Service was fast and friendly. While it was vegetarian the prices were ridiculously inexpensive, particularly by Singapore standards.
3
Was super excited to eat South indian food, in fact was craving it.Read awesome reviews about this place before going.The place is not clean. Honestly, the tables could be wiped better.I liked the thali, but the dosa was really sad. Didn't taste good, especially the filling in it
4
It is an absolutely unassuming place, typical of South Indian joints. Go when you are hungry and in a hurry. It is certainly not a place where you can spend a couple of hours relaxing and chatting. A quick and delicious meal is what you should expect. I would highly recommend the Idlis, dosas, vadas and the pongal. All yummy 
5
I always end up here on every trip to Singapore. Just down the street from Little India MRT station, it's very easy to find. Delicious traditional Indian vegetarian food at excellent value for money. Love their rice and chapati platters. The quality is amazing. It's quite a low key place so don't expect silver service but the staff are generally friendly and the food is served super quick. It's often at full capacity but it's worth waiting for a seat.
1
Rice was very less and seem expensive and sambar curry tasteless regret went there and buy will not go again bye bye writen there extra rice and sambar bring back home still less hmm better go shanti villas and suriya restaurant cheap and best
5
Love going to Little India and eating here at Komali Villa, I mostly come for breakfast & have the masala dosai and chai, simple, cheap and tasty.
Good for families and a must when coming to Singapore, then wander around little India.
5
Delicious food that satisfied my craving for veg ... and chilli! Frequented my the locals of Little India and the comings and goings never stop. A very reasonably priced popular spot.
4
Delicious South Indian food! But queues can be long during lunchtime. Basic and simple stuff. Not fine dining. But wholesome, if you are into Indian vegetarian.
4
Visited here as berlitz guide book I had bought second hand recommended. Not my usual style of choosing a restaurant but it certainly worked. Great food. Great staff and friendly punters
5
Food here is very good and delicious .. amazing indian food and lunch was excellent and we had our lunch here even on next day..
5
I visit here at least once a month and love the Poori set. The staff are helpful and the food delicious. Everyone I have taken has loved the food and experience
5
Saw some groups of Indians going in which is always a good sign.Followed them in and was seated at a table upstairs for the 'rice meal' - This is basically a veg thali. Certainly one of the best I've ever had. Lots of variation and as authentic as any I've had in India. 5 different veg dishes, rice, 2 curd, chapatti and sweet.No cutlery, but just do as the locals.12.50 SGD for veg thali with a sweet lasi. I guess that's around Â£7.50, so good value for singapore really.Recommended

Komala Villas is known as the very best South Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore. We used to be regular customers at their Coleman Street branch, but since that has closed, we ate at the main restaurant in Little India. There is nothing fancy about Komala Villas in terms of ambiance. It is the authentic South Indian cuisine that draws clientele. The place was so crowded on the ground floor when we got there that we headed up to the first floor. Even that seemed cramped. We missed the friendlier atmosphere of the Coleman Street branch. It was delightful, though, to dine on vegetarian briyani, idlis, puris, masala dosa, and chappathis even though the food was not as tasty as we had remembered. We thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and no one complained about the prices. Very reasonable
5
One of the best Indian restaurants in Little India. It's not fancy at all, very basic setting with mostly local clientele, but the vegetarian food is very nice and the prices are reasonable. Good for a lunch or dinner when you hang out in Little India
4
Food is very good, tasty and typical vegetarian indian. Highly recommended. Definitely will go there again if i will end up in Singapore again.
4
Good place to get get the south indian food in little india Area. Specially Best for pure veg 😊people to enjoy the meal. Near from roucher and little india metro station...
3
Every things is good on food . Cost & Taste.
Typical Mylapore attitude when it comes to etiquette. What worked all These years may not in next few years.
Should update or there are many who can eat into their KOT.clean up and update !!
3
Authentic Indian restaurant which is very affordable for everyone.
Simple ambience and simple food. Worth a try.
5
You order anything on their menu & you will be sure to get the best of the Indian taste; be it South Indian, North Indian, Snacks or Chinese. Staff is friendly & very understanding. Hygiene is maintained all through out.
3
A nice restaurant located in Little India. There are 2 branches with easy accessibility from each other.
5
We had the masala dosa and pakoras -both nice, place was very busy so we shared a table with a nice lady - fine with us...Service was good, food came fast...
3
Nothing special about this one at all.. just an average place to have idli dosa.the ground floor can ne quite cramped so i suggest its better you dine on the first floor.ambience is very average .. idlu dosa vada.. puri bhaji are oki.. try the chilli gobi dry for some variety..
4
The decor isn't much and you have to go through the kitchen to use the toilet, but the food is delicious. Spicy but not too hot, the meals offer variety and choice. I had the dosa meal and it was superb and very reasonably priced. It's very like India but without the noise and dirt
5
Picked up this restaurant because of previous reviews. It was delicious. The place was packed with locals but the service was pretty speedy. We had the veg biryani and a dice plate and made the mistake of ordering a cauliflower side plate which want really needed. The portions are generous and interesting with several side dishes and the mango lassi although a lurid colour was good along with fresh apple juice. The whole meal came to $33 about Â£20 and so tasty. Some side dishes were fairly spicy, we are used to eating Indian food, so take care!
5
We went to little India only t have food at komala villas and it was up to expectation . Authentic south Indian meal and dosa. very good.
5
Dosas are crispy with variety of tasty sides. Coffee is awesome. Value for money and even we went 3 times.
5
One of the happiest memories of Singapore. The Biryani lunch special is legendary but don't stop there. Keep coming back and eat the whole menu! My favourite ever Indian restaurant.
3
Food was alright, but not súper tasty. The interior doesn't look very appealing either.
But it is fairly priced. I paid €13,- for a big plate of food and 1 watermelon juice. So that is quite cheap!
4
If you are looking for purely vegetarian Indian food then this is the best place in Singapore for south Indian delicious food dishes.
3
The staff is too rude
They don't know English
The food is ok
Too much rush at the place
The rates are average
5
I've been here several times and love it! Great value for an amazing and authentic meal. $9 for a set thali lunch. Friendly service!
5
Went here last night and loved the food! Very authentic and amazing flavors with fresh ingredients. The value for the food was very good especially in Singapore. Would recommend to everyone!
3
One of the few vegetarian restaurants to offer puttu and kozhukkattu throughout the day. Very popular with Locals visiting 'Tekka' for in-house dining and take-away. Staff who call you 'Amma' and 80-year old waiters make this a memorable little place to visit in the heart of Little India.
5
once you find the place just walk in and go right upstairs dining room- very few people speak english but they have menus in english and just point to what you want. you really cant go wrong with anything you order- it is shocking just how cheap everything is and the flavors are so dynamic. we ordered a dosai melas and garlic nan with cauliflower- it was more food then the 2 of us could eat and a total of $23USD total- cheaper then 1 drink at the Long Bar... it's not fancy and filled with locals- you will enjoy a wonderful authentic Indian vegetarian mea
5
The komala villas provide the most authentic south indian food in singapore at a price that cannot be compared with anyone in singapore.
5
Simple restaurant, very busy with both locals and tourists. Food was great, we had a masala dosa and a puri set.
5
Ambience: good
Food & Drink: Rice Meal, Masala tea and Thosai meal are very constantly delicious, everytime. This is my frequent visit shop in little India.
5
Visited during a busy lunch. The food was inexpensive, tasty and arrived quickly. Can't ask for much more than that. :) Also in a very fun to explore part of the city.
4
Seems that everyone that come in know what to do, where to sit and what to order. This means they are mostly regulars. Food was fresh, important for an Indian restaurant. This is why they have been around for so long.
3
Three ladies went for dinner 2 didn't get what we ordered but it was v tasty and full of locals enjoying a Saturday night out !
5
I was first little bit skeptic How this place might be but I was positively surprised. The service is fast and good and the food is marvellous thinking that it is low cost. The meals are big and you can ask refill if you want. My friend who has been traveling in india also loved this place. Would definetly recommend this place all though you have to remember that this is not a fancy restaurant. Perfect for us
5
Here was our first time in an indian restaurant and we enjoyed so much their food that we would go back if it was possible! We had dinner, in the our last night in Singapore, and tasted differents foods. Everyone was very good!!The restaurant was clean, confortable and cheap!We recommend it!
3
This little food joint is a legendary eatery and by Modi dining here with the Singapore PM last year it gained further popularity. Around 300m walking distance from Little India MRT, it's a South Indian joint. While the taste of the food is decent it's not heavenly that it deserves a 5 rating. The cleanliness of kitchen is questionable and I wouldn't give this a high rating for that surely. It's a like a old style chennai joint and for Singapore I would have expected a better cleanliness.
4
Had read reviews of this restaurant &, as I love dhosa, we had to visit. We were not disappointed!!Now don't be put off by the unassuming exterior. As you go in just grab a table & sit down. I knew that I wanted a masala dhosa & my OH followed suit, as well as ordering an aloo gobi & garlic naan.The restaurant was very busy.The food arrived, each dhosa accompanied by a small portion of daal - which was gorgeous - and 2 other sauces, which were equally tasty. We both tucked in, ripping a piece of dhosa & dipping it in the sauces. The aloo gobi was tasty and of a medium heat & the garlic naan was light and garlicky!! We had water & lemon juice to drink.Komala Villas is a very authentic restaurant serving excellent vegetarian food. If you are in Serangoon Road, Little India give it a try
3
We went with too much... food arrived cold and my order went unheard due to loud music blaring its was ok... had a nice meal reasonable price quick service..
4
clean place , good service , hygienic .. overall would advice anyone who likes indian veg food , this is one of best in singapore...
keep it up
3
Good vegetarian food. You can find these chains in all major MRT stations & shopping malls.
Affordable price. Must try their mock chicken.
5
Komala vilas can be found across SIngapore. They offer good tiffin service-idli, dosa, sambhar, vada and south indian meals. End it with a cup of filter coffee.
5
Cheap and tasty. Service was great. I had vegetable biriyani and couldn't even finish it all due to portions.
5
i have been with friends and find the place very interesting , nice food , nice service and value for money. will come back again
4
I often eat at barefoot down the street (which is amazing), but decided to try something different and less expensive. Komala had good ratings here, and I can see why. WARNING: It can be a bit intimidating for a westerner showing up as it is 90%+ Indian folks and it is a very crowded environment. In fact, I just about turned around, but figured I would ask. The lower floor was packed, but the guy in the front pointed up. There was one 2-person table left and I got seated right away on the second floor. Though, after I already ordered, they asked if I would move to another table with three other guys. I was not upset, I understood they were going to pull my table in with another to seat 6 people. When my food came, I forgot all about the crowd. Wow, it was beautiful and delicious. I had a dosa (pancake looking bread) with a series of delicious "dips" and three vegetables. It was like $8.50 Sing dollars!!! I also had an amazing Indian ice T (with milk and sugar in it). The price was really low and the service was really fast. Again, it is just intimidating because of the crowd. As I was nearly done eating, people were standing (even on the 2nd floor) waiting for a table, clearly my table as I was the last person left. As soon as I stood up my table was occupied again and it was hard to get out because of so many people standing in line. I think I was lucky to eat here at all seeing the crowd at about 8pm (I got there somewhere after 7). I would love to eat here again, but who knows if I will be so lucky to get a table. Yummy and cheap
5
We found the restaurant to be extremely good taste indian veg south Indian food in little indian. Both their restaurants in Buffalo road as well as near Mustafa.We attempted Ananda Bhavan on Buffalo road the first day of stay but quality of Komala was better. Especially the waiters took orders ans served food on the table. Kamala made our days comfortable in Singapore as we could eat indian food at least once in a day
3
The one located at Buffalo road is in between many flower and vegetable sellers. It is generally crowded and people share tables. The ambience isnt great. Only good part about this place is good taste and low cost food. Tried Rawa masala dosa. Chutney was good, dosa was crispy and well cooked, liked it.Good for daily eaters/ visitors or for budget meal
2
Terrible sitting arrangment. crowded and conjusted. Have to wait most of the time for a table as its a popular eatery as its very pocket friendly. You will end up paying bill of $10 for 2 dosas. Most waiters and full of perspiration and tables and floor are dirty. MTR is a much better option.
5
The restaurant is sooooooo crowded, because people are crush on the food here. Although the staff are really busy, the service is good
3
We had a quick lunch here after exploring the majestic streets of little India. Not bad but I am sure there are better options nearby. We don't need to go back.
5
I felt I was back in India when visiting Komala Villas. Don't judge this place on how it looks. Food was served promptly. Very fair prices and very tasty food. Recommended for an authentic, Indian experience away from India.
4
i visited here here in 1982 first time.and still going every time i go to singapore.very much same food and same taste.busy all the time.there are few on same name but go to oldest one to have real food.
4
Best South Indian food that has the original south Indian taste, fresh food all the time of the day without trying to cook enmass and keep it for the whole day. Price also reasonable thought not the best prices.
4
Dined on 4th Nov'2016Time 9.30pmHad Veg Biryani and Poori Meal and Masala Dosa Mealthe food quantity , quality and taste are at par with good restaurants in India.Price is from S$ 6 to S$ 8.50 and you can have a hearty meal and come out satisfied.Highly recommended
5
One word. Awesome, can't believe the food here for the price. Had two huge puri with chick pea curry for $4.20, bloody amazing! Tasted so good and their veg samosa, OMG! Breakfast for two $11.20, a steal! Place isn't much to look at but it doesn't need to be, the staff a friendly and attentive. I can't wait to go back.
5
This may be a little crowded, especially at lunch. You must order at the counter upstairs before being seated. Be patient. Relax. Order and pay - very little by the way. The prices are amazingly low for a Singapore restaurant. Wait for your table, and don't be upset if there are others seated at the same table. Say "Hi" and then get down to your meal.This is all vegetarian. If you are a meat eater (like I am), give in and try a veggie meal. It will be filling and absolutely tasty. Make sure that one of the items you order is naan, and I highly recommend the cheese naan. Our group of four ordered one to accompany one person's meal. We ended up getting three more.If you have never eaten with your fingers before, watch how the others do this and give it a try. There is a sink in the corner, so you can wash your hands before and after you eat. If this isn't for you, then use the fork and spoon the server will give you with the meal (assuming you don't look Indian or South Asian, in which case you might have to request the fork and spoon).Water comes with the meal, but they have fruit milkshakes you might want to try.In addition to South Indian, they North Indian and Tandoori dishes. If you visit their restaurant, you can review the menu. We were at the 76 Serangoon Road location in Little India.This is worth the visit. My entire meal was $9.00 Singapore Dollars. The others at the table had meals under $5.00 Singapore Dollars
4
I came there alone so I got a table in seconds and my food in under a minute. Water to drink is free on each table. Pretty awesome. The restaurant was packed and I sat at a table with three strangers. The staff was incredibly calm and friendly. It is the opposite of a quite restaurant but the food is very good
3
Went with family for dinner one day. We had dosas and a chappati plate. The north indian fare was not so great. South indian fare was good - but we felt that the other options like ananda bhavan were more better in terms of offerings.Recommended - but would not agree with the hype associated with this name
4
You find very good veg food here. This restaurant has always been famous in singapore and became more popular when recently PM of India Mr.Narendra Modi visited this.
5
Everything was good. Mostly Indian customers. We had a late lunch and as westerners we were of the fee not eating with the fingers.
Huge plates of food went by for the hungry locals.
4
Visited the restaurant and spending a few hours walking around Little India, had to queue for a few minutes as it was very busy. Enjoyed the experience and the food. Food was reasonably priced and the staff was very friendly.
3
It is like any other typical South Indian restaurant near Mustafa shopping center in Singapore.
Average food, only dosas are good. Rest of the food items are average in taste. Nothing great about it.
5
We just loved it - cheap and cheerful but also excellent and authentic!We ordered a Dosa Meal and a Chapatti Meal, together a Mango Lassi and a Watermelon Juice... The "meals" are very generous, and were served on a banana leaf. Delicious chutneys and Dahl/Gravies appropriate to the Dosa/Chapatti were accompanied by vegetable sides and it was an extremely tasty and satisfying meal, in a wonderfully authentic true-to-its-1947-roots setting..!Not to be missed and great value for money. Only down side it seems always busy and you might have to wait a few mins for your modest laminex table.We loved it
4
Komala vilas restaurant is situated in busy centre and nearby malls, hotels, metro station are there. Quality of food is nice. Vegetarian south indian food are available at affordable cost. Prime Ministers of both Singapore and India discussed in Komala vilas hotel. Even parcel service is available.

We stumbled upon this restaurant and thought we would give it a shot. We were seated quickly and the staff were attentive throughout. A good choice of vegetarian Indian food was on offer. We had a number of dishes that were superb, tasty and filling. Spice level was right. The bill came in used SD15 which trust me is a cheap meal for two in Singapore. Would recommend to any foodie who like to get there hands dirty with some authentic Indian cuisine. I also like that there was an obvious place to wash hands pre and post meal. Will visit again

I had stayed at Singapore for almost a week, and prefered to have both meals at Komala's Villas. Chhole Bhature, Mysore Masala Dosa and Masala Dosa were the best. Average costing for 2 people for a meal would come around roughly S$10-15. The offer good quantity and also quickest service. Ambience is average but the food is excellent...!

We were recommended this restaurant in Little India but when we turned up we were a little worried as it looks quite plain from the outside but we went with it and we weren't disappointed. It serves Indian vegetarian food only but it was extremely tasty and sooo cheap. A main meal was $4.20 (Â£2?) and it was great. A good sign was that there were quite a few Indians eating in there and mostly just using their hand
5
If you are around little India in Singapore this is an ideal location to have a meal with big family. The restaurant serve good South Indian Dishes along with few pan Indian delicacies. The price is very reasonable and they serve till 10 o clock in the evening.

I have just arrived in Singapore and this was my first choice and I definitely was not disappointed. Such fantastic food.
Typical service, but the food was so authentic in appearance and flavor ! How brilliant will be coming here again.
Thank you

Masala Dosai and samosa set for a quick lunch washed down by a great masala chai - hot sweet and well flavoured. Place is no beauty pageant winner but service is good and the food is terrific and cheap.
3
Really liked the choices on the menu and our meals. People were friendly but the place could improve by providing napkins and cleaning a bit more.
2
The premise is conveniently located in Little India and literally a canteen for locals and tourists alike. The service is almost non existent and the food tastes quite bland. Price is not as cheap considering the ingredients are all veggies.
4
Went here with a couple of friends. Awesome service, our server helped us with understanding the menu and told us what he recommended. What really exceeded our expectations was that we got refills(!!!) when the gravies ran out he refilled and when the bread was out we got new bread (not naan). Very nice. There is no bathroom in this restaurant though. When i asked for the toilet I had to walk through the kitchen to a disgusting toilet that was all wet and nasty. The food though: awesome.
5
Eat with the locals for the real experience says it all. We were seated upstairs and apart from on other couple were the only non Indians in the place. The service was attentive and genuine. The food was delicious and abundant. All the diners were enjoying their food and the atmosphere was amazing. Ask if you are not sure what or how much to order. You can wash you hands in running after before and after eating. Where we were upstairs the tap was near to the top of the stairs. Take tissues with you as serviettes not provided which is normal practice in most local eateries
4
Really enjoyed the food as usual. It is a place I like to go to when I am in Singapore especially as I don't eat meat and enjoy Indian food. The reason why I gave 4 stars this time instead of 5 stars was because they had changed their seating system since my last visit or this was how it was portrayed to me. I went upstairs and before I could secure a seat I needed to choose my dishes and pay which I felt put a lot of pressure on people who don't come often and need time to decide what they will eat ( especially as we are a party of 5 - 3 adults and 2 young kids) but as it is so popular people began queuing behind us so we had to choose quickly so we found this disappointing this time
3
The food here is pretty much the standard for Little India. Not a lot of big standouts but loads of staff standing around if you need assistance. Menu is set out clearly and the food arrives quickly. Water on the tables and plastic disposable cups are available. My boys wanted the mini chocolate dosai for desert but 'don't have'. Which was disappointing.Better places but usually have plenty of spots at tables
4
My father has been going to Komala Vilas since the 1970's when he was in the airforce and every time he visits Singapore he goes there. He said to me if you are even in Singapore you have to try this restaurant. The dÃ©cor is basic but the food is sensational. We both had the onion uthappam and rose milk. It was very busy, but the staff were very friendly and accommodating. We shared a table with some locals. We also bought some take away deserts which were perfect.I will be coming back to try other items on the menu
4
I have been visiting this restaurant for more than a decade since I live in Singapore. The food be it breakfast, lunch or dinner is quite tasty but sometimes they don't come piping hot especially thosas - all varieties. The restaurant has ton see to it that customers are getting it in the right temperature. No one likes cold thosais, idlis. The food is ofcourse quite tasty. But now & then they can change the variety of chutneys served. The same style of chutney as a side dish for quite a long time is boring. Ofcourse hygiene can be improved a lot
5
Excellent food. Served very quickly and knife and spoon was available. Great price.
Food tasted great. I would go back.
1
Poor service with every order wrong both food and drinks
Drinks arrived at very end and to cap it they were watered down drinks
Lousy food
5
Just Entered the Restaurant for 1st time due to so much Hunger... not knowing Veg or Non Veg Restaurant.....
But on a Note Veg Restaurant and the Food was Awesome..... Best Meal.... better than Meat..... just Loved it... for sure will come again...
4
Was there for breakfast - south indian, filter coffee. Very famous place, small but clean and tasty food.
4
What does an Indian restaurant full of Indians as well as non-Indians tell you? Delicious Indian foods!
Yummy food, nice coffee, fast service. And don't forget to grab some sweet or savoury snacks on your way out.
5
Very Good South Indian Vegetarian Restaurant. I liked the Vegetarian Meals very much. Best for Vegetarians.
4
Spicy fare especially the thosai with the chutneys. Inexpensive and tasty. Aviod the lunchtime crowd though as it was difficult to get a seat.
4
I visited Komal Vilas Restaurant,Singapore from 25th to 28th August 2016 with my family.Since I am from Bengaluru,I was searching for Dosa,Idly,Vada & south meals & Trip advisor was very much helpful to locate this restaurant .On 25th Night I ate South Indian meals which comprise of Rise ,Sambar,Rasam,sweet Kheer,vada,carrot palya,sagu,Curd,papad,pickle with Pooris. ( PRICE:7.9 SG).Very good taste indeed. My wife had North meal which contained Rotis, Vegetarian Biryani . My daughter liked Rava Dosa.Variety of meals like :BIRYANI POORI MEAL,PLAIN DOSA MEAL,BHATURA MEAL,POORI MEAL,PONGAL MEAL are also availableVariety of Dosas,Idly,Vada,Utappam are also available,(Price :3.8-4.8 SG) .we enjoyed south Indian food all the days during our stay at Singapore.Metro & Bus services are available very near to restaurant
2
Considering the restaurant to be a long standing institution I expected the traditions to be maintained. The food has stood the test of time, consistent good quality food. The waiters messed up some of our orders. It is totally inexcusable that such poor hygiene is allowed in Singapore - no tissues on the table, cutlery dripping with washing liquid(when brought to the table), washing area(wet and dirty), waste bin (it seems it has never been washed in all these years). I was extremely uneasy after eating there. If they cannot maintain hygiene in the more public areas of the restaurant, I cannot trust them with the hygiene in the kitchen. Never again for me!
4
Had lunch at this restaurant. The menu has a lot of options. All varieties of dosas, set meal etc. Ordered Biryani and rice meal. It was really good. Particularly friends are not Indians and relished the food. There are a lot foreigners as this most famous restaurant around.
4
The food is good and reasonably priced. It's not a very big hotel and cleanliness could be improved.
Having eating in many other restaurants in Singapore this was one of the better ones so its a must visit and worth walking a bit more.
5
Located on Serangoon road in Little India this place seems to be favorite for locals. Delicious South-indian food at good price. You are suggested to eat with your hands.
4
This place specialises in amazing south indian food and is open till late night. All south indian dishes and meals are available. Chola Bhatura was very nice. Clean Tables but jam packed place. Self service!
3
We came here for our date night dinner last night. The food was nice and an interesting (almost amusing) mix of Indian, Chinese and even Western. The only disappointment was how long it took to flag down wait staff to take our order.
5
After visiting Komala vilas and saravana bhavan, I find Komala vilas is 100 times better. Though it is little crowded during peak hours, food is very good, hotel is maintained very neat. Food (lunch) is served on banana leaf. Cost also less than Saravana bhavan.
2
Visited with a bunch of hungry souls (extended family with seniors and kids) anticipating delicious south Indian vegetarian fare but were completely turned off by the ambience and hygiene. Were made to wait for our table in a queue literaly standing over the other seated diners' heads. The restroom area was flthy. The same hand towel roll used for the restroom was provided as "napkin"/ tissue in the restaurant.Even after ignoring the above, the foo was strictly average so wouldn't really go through the trouble again
4
I went with a few out of town friends to show them around Little India and to try some vegetarian food. It is a very simple restaurant with good food. The only dish we did not like was the Channa Masala. Also, it definitely seemed like the mushrooms in the Mushroom Mattar were canned and not fresh. However, it is a very inexpensive restaurant, so I suppose this is to be expected
5
This is the perfect place to come to when the nearby hawker Centre starts to close as it is open until quite late. The food is a bit pricier but this is made up for by the brilliant service. The vegetarian food is great (no meat in sight) with the dosas being particularly noteworthy. Our server was extremely warm to us and continued to offer to fill up our plates when they emptied with more of the vegetable curries. This was very true to the Indian hospitality of not leaving a plate empty
5
A friend recommend us to try this restaurant at Little India district. The place was not fancy but you can get comfortable enough with the space and air conditioned room. The waiter was very helpful and he didn't write anything as we order (there were 5 of us) but he remembered every single order. The food was vegetarian, but believe me if all vegetarian food taste like this, you might not need any meat anymore. All curry taste on point, the various bread was delicious. Definitely will come back. Oh one more thing, we went there on Sunday night, the road was very crowded full of people just standing around in the street side. I don't know whether it was like that the whole week or is it there's something about that sunday night, but with that crowd, it is quite hard to travel with kids and stroller.
4
A busy restaurant serving a wide range of Indian vegetarian fare. Service is prompt and the dishes pack a punch, but with a wide range of flavors. The place can be a little crowded, but sharing a table with other satisfied diners is part of the charm. Definitely worth a visit
5
In have been in komala few times during my visit to Singapore and I kept coming back I love everything that I try from smaosas to any type of dosas and the rice meal....will definitely come back again
3
Excited and went there and realised it is not same komala Vilas from Nellore. It's a Tamil Small restaurant. But food is ok and reasonably priced. It is just in Little india. Easy to access.
2
This place looks awesome from outside, but the ambience inside is pathetic...was not at all impressed!!
4
South Indian restaurant with good food inclusing the masala tosai and chutney. Tea was a bit sweet. Inexpensive.
5
The menu has all the items you can expect from a south indian restaurant. the taste is good.
the ambience is a let down..
4
The veggie meal is better than other hotels, expensive though! You can try sambar vadai, dosai, idily. You get filter coffee here!
5
it has to be best as it was choice of our p.m. narendra modiji. food is nice, taste and service is too good
3
Went there for dinner, food is quite good we're very happy. Would be better if the whole environment is wider and cleaner.
在Komala吃晚餐，食物很不錯、吃得很開心。如果餐廳環境可以再寬敞、乾淨一點會更好。
4
We always want our own food, how much ever we travel..the taste of ones own type of food is a craving for most people. This is where Komala Vilas stepped in on my recent family trip to Singapore. We went there every other day in our 10 day stay at Singapore. 4 dinner meals were had there and we tried everything from idlis, dosas, north indian, meals,,,and ate to our stomachs satisfaction. Also since the hotel we stayed at was in downtown Singapore it was good seeing some familiar Indian faces everytime we went here at night after a hectic day of running around amusement parks. Food Quality - V Good, Ambience - Very cramped but we do not really care. Hygiene - Average, Pricing - Average. (Do not convert to INR..as we will find everything expensive if we do that
4
Had a quick and tasty meal here with my family. Very simple but kid friendly. Food is all vegetarian and very tasty. Amazing super crispy naan for the kids. Curries were delicious. Staff lovely to kids and high chairs available. Apparently even the Prime Minister popped in for a meal a few weeks ago
4
Really enjoyed it. The food was really good and filling. Good value for money. The service was excellent.
We'd never had south Indian before and we weren't dissapointed.
5
Great meals
Felt eating full lunch at home in india
Tasted great
Tiffin in the evening also tastes great
Best south Indian restaurant with good taste always
4
Visited recently with family for evening dinner. Service was quick, good quality food and at pocket friendly prices.
5
Great food, great coffee, great culture. I place I've gone for my dose of vegetarian indian food since I was young. Authentic! 😊
5
Great food and service, I'm not big on vegetable only meals but was more than happy with the selection and flavours on offer here.
4
Dropped in for breakfast with the family. Ordered a bunch of snacks. The red relish was great as well as the Masala dosa. Watermelon juice was freshly squeezed. The filter coffee is fantastic!
5
While in singapore , you are in a land where people relish all sorts of sea food and meats of all kinds .. for vegetarians , this place is a dream destination as you get the taste and flavour of home and that too at not very costly prices as compared to other places in singapore 
3
This restautant is located in Sarengoon road at the corner of little India. All kinds of North and South Indian food are served. Price was Cheap. Delivery was fast. We tried Chhole bhature, dosa, idli. They serve very big..one thali size Bhaatura, but it was not so good- rubbery. Dosa was nice. Its OK place but for vegetarian people it is the only saviour
5
I was unable to eat anything in Singapore because meat or egg was added in any food that i ordered. Too tired of eating biscuits alone for the whole day. Best south Indian food was served. Truly delicious. Even Indian Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi visited here. :)
3
Great coffee available and makes authentic South Indian cuisine. You can opt for a prata set meal which is very reasonable with lassi. Avoid the badam milk as it tastes synthetic. The chana bhatura can be too oily for the calorie conscious. The idli, dosa, upma and thali are highly recommended. Service is quick but the ambience is strictly average. Food is prepared hygienically.
4
very nice veg food with Thali system and very economic.Indian food in singapore is easily available at little India. among most Indian Restaurants Komla villa is best.
5
If you are vegetarian and looking for authentic Indian meal then Komala Villas is the place.You will all kind of choices but go for south Indian food.
5
Very good food and good service. We came almost at the closing time - but were entertained and served hot food.
Good service, cleanliness could be improved. Complete value for money
4
The quantity quality and price are very much competitive. they use disposable spoons and plates. Taste is also good.
3
Food variety is so so. Quality is Ok. Bit expensive. Non-courteous staff. Need to wait for a long time.
5
The most authentic South Indian food that I've ever tasted! From the Uttapam to the Chettinad thali, from the podi chutney to the filter coffee, it is a relief for a vegetarian Indian visiting Singapore. Do not miss it!
5
I've been here 5 times. We've ordered different items each time and everything is delicious and affordable. We've been here so often because every time we have visitors, we insist that they need to experience good Indian food. The service is good. A full meal for 4 people will cost around S$55. I'm sure I'll be going back.
5
If you are a fan of South Indian veg food , then this is th place to visit.We visited Singapore between 1st and 4th June 2016. We were told about this place by a local Chinese driver. He cautioned us against visiting other Komala restaurants and recommended Komala vilas. Komala vilas is a typical south India eatery. No great ambience. Simple tables and chairs. Modest cleanliness .However the food here is great. We had the rice meal . It is served on a tray lined with banana leaf. Steaming hot rice is served with many vegetables and curries . Rasam is rally nice. Topped with curd and payasam , it's really a great meal. The whole meal costs just 8 sgd. considering the prices in Singapore , this is rally a great deal.The taste was authentic and the staff v y courteous. They are really keen and interested in serving you. A must visit for anyone who loves sloth Indian beg meals
5
Komala Vilas Restaurant serves excellent food with great customer service (Special mention must be made of Mr. Balu). The best part is it has both South and North Indian varieties to cater to each one's requirements. The quality of all items are good and service is also fast. Price is also reasonable. If you're particular about having Indian food at Singapore, this is a must eat place
4
The food was Ok in taste. Its a no fuss, self service place. Everything was served in disposable cups and plates. And its pure vegetarian. Lots of Indians visit this place for south Indian fare. It was expensive but we had no choice that evening as this was the place open even after 10 PM
4
Visited this restaurant after reading an online blog and wasnt dissapointed! Food was excellent and great value for money. We paid $17 (sd) for two meals. If your looking for a real little india experience this is a must!
4
Good place for refreshments, particularly for south Indian vegetarian foods.
It has many branches in and around serangoon road.
We took food at komala Vilas just opposite to city square mall
4
This is a very good South Indian restaurant. The food is good and tasty.The service is good and fast .The prices good.
4
When the Prime Minister of Singapore takes Prime Minister of India, of all places, to this restaurant for dinner, that in itself speaks volumes about this place.
The restaurant feels congested even when not crowded due to less moving space.
5
This was some of the best Indian food we have ever had. Each dish was flavourful and you get a good amount of food for a cheap price. If you're in Little India you need to eat a meal, or two, here.
3
Food quality is OK, but felt a bit expensive. As it is a self serviced restaurant, you have to wait for a long time to get your food and if you want to eat more, again you have to go to counter, pay, and then go to service desk, wait (depending on the crowd) and then again search for a place to sit and eat. I didn't like this way. Not that great food to have this kind of service
1
Went there after reading reviews esp the one that stated about the PM going there with Modi. Went upstairs for the aircon, and surprised when asked to order before we even sat down!My wife went for the chapatti set meal, and I asked for the veg briyani meal. Both were pretty tasteless, and v v disappointing. Considering the range of curries from the Indian subcontinent they could provide, this was v poor. Do the PM's have such poor taste?Asked for the loo - got a shock when he pointed to back of kitchen, which you have to walk through first. As it was after 4pm, they were washing up and water was 1/2 inch deep that I had to wade through. No idea what the health and safety laws in S'pore are, but maybe they need to look at this.This restaurant had a long history but appears to be letting itself down. AVOID if possibl
5
I have known this place from 1980 and the rice meal I always order is consistently great in taste, freshness and variety. For me this is very similar to what I got at home in India when I was growing up. Keep up the good work
5
I was on a family holiday this may 2016, once when i hit serangoon road, my first option was the komalas, They have a very nice and clear line up of south indian food range. served with the traditional taste. very hygienic & well maintained ambience. A must visit for those who wants south indian breakfast, lunch & dinner. When i was there with my family. the staff members were very courteous & very friendly, Especially komalas branch ( the Multi cusine branch )in syed alwi road, located very close to mustafa and other small shopping center's, The staff member Waiters Mr.ilayaraja & Mr. kumaresan was very dedicated in their service. Manager Mr. Mahesh was very approachable to for your needs.Senior Manager Mr. Vasudevan & Supervisor Mr. Mohammed Yusuf are at your service in a very friendly..
5
This is a Traditional India cuisine restaurant in Singapore. Especially south indian food available. Always there is crowd at this place, as they serve non-stop food, starting from breakfast, lunch, evening snacks, dinner and home delivery too. Can be tried if you are tired of eating International cuisine dishes. Place is very clean, hygiene maintained with quality food and service too
4
We went with family and had dinner in Komala Villas, this is a very good place and those who want to try south indian food this is the place.
5
I come here often, so good and authentic taste of South Indian food.
My best buys are Idly, Puri and filter coffee :)
They still charge just 1.5$ for a coffee which is awesome. Prices are quite reasonable and food is mostly fresh.
4
Good dosas (thosai), even the fries here taste great. The Rava thosai and the mango lassi are a must-try.
3
South Indian restaurant on Serangoon Road, Little India. Ok for a budget meal with your typical Udipi type menu -- dosas, idlis, vadas, etc. A bit congested. Restroom was not good at all.
3
A traditionally old restaurant which server the south Indian breakfast, lunch and dinner, the food taste and quality is OK only not so good as people are saying big. having some better hotels near by
4
We visited komala vilas restaurant in race course road with family two kids ( one kid of 4 and other of one) . It was a special day for us and we enjoyed it throughly . The service was good food quality was good and price reasonable.
3
I have to tell you i was really horrified to see the level of cleanliness when i went to the wash area of this restaurant.The whole place is filthy!I am shocked that the authorities have not checked the cleanliness level of this eateries at Little india and the washrooms.Very disgusting!!Tables are wiped repeatedly with the same cloth over and over and its grimy!!Somebody teach them to rinse the washcloth to wipe the tables and use disinfectant!food crumbs are all over the floor and service is very slow and poor.kindly upgrade and clean up your eatery,its filthy
5
5 of us found this place in little india while looking for a place to have lunch which was our first meal in Singapore. Frankly the crowd and the smell pulled us to this place and the fact that it had both north and south Indian cuisine, i had the south indian thali which was filling, very delicious and cheap my friends had the kadhi paneer, naan, chola bhature and masala dosaEverything was delicious and everything was very reasonably prices.Must visit for indian food lovers or who want a pocket friendly mea
5
I was there twice, each time I couldn't believe that it's so so delicious! I had dosa, rice and Indian pizza, all served together with tasty sauces. Masala chai is amazing aswell, the service is super friendly and it gets crowded in the peak hours. Apart from this, it's veeery cheap - perfect value for money!
5
We went to Komala Villas as a group of four - 2 x vegetarians, 1 x omnivore, and 1 x reluctant carnivore. We ordered 2 special rice platters, 2 thick onion dosa, and some spicy fried cauliflower. All of the food was so delicious. The rice platter came with about 8 different sauces on a banana leaf, and you can have top-ups of your favourites. Our carnivorous friend licked his banana leaf clean, and couldn't stop talking about how tasty the food was. We were so full at the end, and the bill to feed 4 big eaters (and including 2 fresh pressed juices) came to $36. So cheap! Would recommend to anyone, you won't even miss the meat
3
Food is really good and tasty, but they have to give importance to hygiene too.
Many places in this restaurant was stinking.
I had a lunch set which served lot of varieties in it, and it tasted really authentic. Price is reasonable.
4
Nice Indian veggies at affordable prices. The service was nice and the settings were ok. If you love Indian food this is one place you can be.
4
I visited the restaurant with my friends and it is really nice.The place is nice with good service.The taste is good.The place is packed when we went for lunch.Really a good restaurant to visit in Singapore.
5
Had my favourite food for breakfast there last Friday. Very nice. Served hot with a lovely chutney. Great coffee. Superb service. The area around the wash room could be cleaner.
5
The food at Komala is amazing, the portions a huge, they even fill up your plate, nice staff, fair prices
4
We joined the queue on the street and were pleasantly surprised by how quickly they moved customers through. This is an "old school" vegetarian curry house with food served on tin plates. Don't worry about what to order, as the menu comes with pictures but even better just look at what the local's are eating then ask them what it is. All dishes are delicious!
1
Had lunch at Komala Vilas yesterday. Horrible food. Most side dishes had an over dose of fennel seeds . ForSGD 8.50, it was not worth at all. When I mentioned my disappointment to the owner , he just said that no one else was complaining. Arrogant and rude behaviour. Would never step into any of their restaurants ever again
3
Its a small yet really renowned Indian restaurant in Singapore's Little India and it serves up mostly South Indian food.The place is congested and run off the mill.The food is decent but I wouldn't call it Authentic as I have had better Dosas/Idlys in places apart from India as well and this was not at that level. The prices are pretty cheap so thats a plus. The entire family had a wholesome meal in under 30 dollars
4
Though there are a lot of branches in little India we went to the oldest one. It was very crowded bit we managed to get a seat.The chutneys with the dosas were mouth watering. The filter coffee is the best. The ambience was not too good as this was an old branch but the price was reasonable too. Overall Enjoy a heart warming meal in the heart of Singapore
4
Dropped in at around 10.30am after visiting sim ling square. Actually went into quench my thirst as the heat was terrible on that day. The atmosphere within looked so cosy decided to have a brunch in the form of paper dhosai, ulundu vadai and coffee. They did not have tea. I am not too certain whether they do not supply tea or on that particular day they did not have tea. The taste of the food did not matter whether I drink tea or coffee. It is a very clean, airconditioned cosy place situated at a nice location. When you enter you may wonder whether it is a North Indian restaurant as there are a couple of Sardarjis working. Food is fine. Place is very clean. Value for money. Very authentic South Indian restaurant. Must visit place if you are a lover of south indian food
4
A popular vegetarian restaurant with locals and tourists.. Offers a good array of dishes at value for money price. We were so impressed that we dined twice at this restaurant.
5
When we were in Singapore, we used to have breakfast almost daily here. The quality of the food is awesome. My 2 year old kid also liked the food there. It was sometimes crowded. Had to wait to get a seat.
5
I was back after 9 years in this amazing vegetarian restaurant, the food was exellent, the service good and the people very nice. The thali (meal) with unlimited refill was great with up 10 different courses, the masala dosa was the best I had in life (I spent 2 years in India!). I've been for the first time in this restaurant 30 years ago. It's always a great pleasure to get back. Cheap & best!Marco Moretti, Italy, ecoreport.or

Hi Friends,Staying in Serangoon Road, or just visiting Littile India? Tired after bags full of shopping at Mustafa mall? Hungry for Indian food? Step into Komala vilas for authentic, tasty Indian food. The hotel apprently is being run by locals now, with Sardarjee waiters but food was pucca South Indian. Superb and more than filling Thali meal. Good filter coffee too. Hop in and enjoy the food at reasonable prices.
5
My videographer recommended this place for the most authentic Indian food. It's simple, cheap, and I had dishes I was not familiar with, or would find with only great difficulty in the states.It's hard to order if you're not familiar with this type of cuisine, but there are many thali, or combination plates, so the best thing is just to dig in. Mine came with pickles, chutney, a papadum, and chapati, in addition to biryani and other dal (legume) curries. Very filling, and with two people eating, and lassis to drink the bill came to SG$25 (around US$18.50)
5
Located on Serangoon Road in the heart of Little India, it is a must-stop while exploring the shops and temple of this area. The vegetarian food is simple but so tasty. The restaurant is not elegant, but it has lots of local atmosphere. The place is popular with locals so you may need to wait for a table or go upstairs. We are repeat customers and highly recommend Komala's for genuine South Indian vegetarian food at a fare price. Be sure to try the masala dosa. Before leaving, pick up some sweets or cracker snacks at the Komala bakery shop next door
5
We have been to Komala Vilas several times over many years, and visited again a few weeks ago. And as usual, the food was superb - genuine South Indian food, the service was fine, and the prices are very reasonable. This is one of the restaurants that one MUST visit in S'pore, assuming you do like South Indian food
4
A very nice Restaurant for South Indian Food (purely vegetarian) and prices also reasonable as per Singapore standard. Per head charges for food come to around S$6-8 (nearly Rs. 300-400/- in India). It has three branches, all nearby, and having same name (all in Little India ). It opens up at 0700 hrs in the morning and was most convenient for early breakfast, eating or packing for going to Zoo or Jurong Bird park, as one has to reach there by 0930 hrs. Another restaurant having same name as Komala Restaurant is present near Mustafa Centre, one and half kilometer away from this one. That one is from other group and is slightly more expensive. Preperation is very good here
4
We ate here when we visited mustafa 24Ã—7 shopping center. Clean and well maintained.. You can see Indians who liked dosai and all South Indian dishesh.. Pure veg restaurant. It was little crowded.. Cheap food with proper quantity.. People can enjoy Indian dishesh here.. 3SGD for masala dosai.. Proper rate.. I would recommend it for pure veg travellers ..
5
My friends and I ate dinner here on our first night in Singapore, directed by our hostel receptionist. What a find! All of us were trying dosai for the first time. The masala onion dosai was amazing, although the portion was too large for my small appetite. The onion bhaji was alright, but we have had better

Thanks to previous reviews, we had our first meal in Singapore at this joint and enjoyed every single bite! Food was fresh and there was a good variety of menu choices. Would have returned had we stayed for another few days.
3
Solid Indian fare, good for vegans and at an unbeatable price. A good experience worth trying. Simple fare can sometimes surprise you.
5
Consistently good, always packed so you may need to wait. South Indian vegetarian meal offers a good range of flavours and more than you can eat.
5
Had lunch here on the 16th of Feb. Same standard and taste as having lunch here 20 years ago ! Ordered the Paper Dosai - never disappointed. Could do with an upgrade but will never miss the rustic charm !
4
I ate at this restaurant with my family! It's a good place to grab authentic South Indian food...the rava masala dosa and the rava sada were good. However I didn't like the buttermilk..it had an artificial flavour as if it contained soda. Service was good. It's a good place to end a nice and tiring day after all site seeing in Singapore. Must visit atleast once
4
I was traveling in Singapore last week with a colleague who's a vegetarian. He's a native Indian as well, so we decided to head to Little India in search of authentic southern Indian cuisine. We were so pleased with this place that we came here twice!For me the key was the very nice set menu, mine being bread-based to ease the eating challenge. The food was quite tasty, and the service was good as well. A few notes:+ it's crowded and noisy so don't go there for the ambiance+ there are only a few drink choices, none particularly large and none particularly cold (both of which you'd want after a long hot walk)+ the value is insanely good. You won't believe what you'll pay for a meal!We were quite pleased to find this place
5
This place didn't disappoint us. We stayed at Tyrwhitt Road. We used to walk 15 minutes everyday from our hotel to Komala Villas for Indian Food. The food is very tasty here, clean hotel, value for money. Felt like we were having the food in one of the south indian eateries in India
4
A small and packed, busy restaurant with tasty Indian food. The quality vs. price is great and was an overall pleasant visit for lunch. The toilet needs a facelift and passing through kitchen is not optimal.. Can warmly recommend for tasty food and cheap prices when in Little India
1
This place seemed promising, and at first I was enjoying the flavour of the South Indian cuisine, until I bit into a not insubstantial rock. Obviously I sent my food back and indicated that I didnt need a replacement, however they insisted on giving me something different and then charged me for it.Prior to the rock incident I would have been impressed by the flavours and the food at such affordable prices. Although I do feel like it is overrated
4
Bustling, you might have to wait a few minutes for a seat, but there's a real buzz here, and the prices are pretty realistic (low). Worth the wait though, I only tried the vegetable jalfrezi and a Naan (I'm not a veggie) and they were vg, although the naan's here are like chapatis, perhaps they just don't do big naans in these part
4
Komala Vilas one of the legendary restaurants in Singapore, been around for ages now and still continues to be popular among locals as well as tourists.
The food is served on the traditional banana leaf which makes the experience very enjoyable :)
4
I would say this is one of the best South Indian Vegetarian Restraurant in Singapore. Mid priced, do not expect hi-service levels as management being run as old school style and traditional. Nevertheless the staffs are attentive and reasonable.
4
This is an average looking place with a medium-high price tag for the items served.
Food is good, especially the authentic Sambar. It's yumm!
Do try this when you visit Singapore.
4
I was longing for simple dal chapati rice meal after traveling the streets of Pattaya and Bangkok. And Komala didn't disappoint.I felt I was in one of the eateries of Bangalore that pride on good quality food and promptness of service. The price appears high,but this is Singapore. Must visi
5
We sat upstairs, ordered, and even though the restaurant was packed, our food was brought in about 5 minutes. Quick service, and our waiter was very friendly to answer any of our questions about the meals.Food was delicious! My fiance grew up in Bangalore and kept going on about how everything tasted great and was prepared properly.Price was pretty good, would be cheaper in India, but of course cost of living will always change meal prices wherever you are. We had a Rice Meal, Masala Dosai, Coffee, and some Butter Nan for right at $17
2
I Don't know about the other experience but my Coach driver tells me that this is a very good Indian Family Restaurant in which Our Prime Minister Mr.Modi also takes a Dinner with the Singapore Prime Minister,so I thought this is a best Restaurant to try for but after Eating the Rava Dosa,but after Ordered I cannot see Rava in that Dosa It is a Plain Masala Dosa you can eat anywhere in India at Ferrywala's.I have also ordered a Paneer Butter Masala which is also Pathetic & has a taste of Sweet & Sour also ordered two Nans which is also Bad.So overall it is poor experience of The Restaurant.
5
It is absolutely the place food I've eaten in Singapore. The South Indian food was so yummy, I was reminded of the food at home! Had dosas here and they were truly delicious. Price was pretty reasonable too, and the location was easily accessible. Stop by if you like Indian food
5
We went here and tried their bathura. It was delicious and came with hot thick fries. We also ordered the salt lassi and I must say that that was also quite refreshing.I would definitely love to go there again to try their other mouth watering dishes
5
Komala vilas arguably remains one of the best South Indian food restaurants in Singapore . I have been there multiple times over the last 10 years and the quality and consistency of the food remains excellent. My preference is for the Sunday rice meal, which has an excellent variety of vegetables. The service at both of its outlets ( serangoon and race course road) is friendly, efficient and attentive
3
We tried Komala Vilas during our Singapore visit just because our PM Modi dined here during his last visit. We went for dinner and found that the place was little crowded, bit overpriced and lack of cleanliness when compared to our regular restaurant. The service was also slow and the lady at the counter was bit rude and declined to accept card payment
5
Komala Vilas has always been the iconic Indian vegetarian restaurant in Singapore for decades. It pulls such a crowd that you are always waking in line anytime of he day. Their meals are generous and tasty. A very good value for money.
4
We were recommended to this restaurant by the head chef at our hotel. We had lunch for 4 and enjoyed everything about it. Great flavours and value @ $30
4
tasty indian food with reasonable rates and ambiance if you are not very particular about hygiene...
5
If u really hungry, don't really care for ambience and cleanliness, u should head here. One of the cheapest places around in serangoon road. A nice south Indian meal costs only 9sgd. Must try for once if u r visiting singapore.
4
Visited several times since 2010! Good food, express service, sumptuous meals! But they can improve on the appearance near wash area and entry to kitchen as it leaves a question mark on cleanliness but nevertheless to say I am a regular customer and I have never had any Gastrointestinal problems so far after consuming food there
5
Many recommendations in Yelp I just found out. But we just happened to look in and this restaurant smelt good! So we sat. Pointed to a lot of food and a few of my group knew what to order. Everything that came out was tasty flavorful and delicious don't for get to eat everything f with your fingers. They do or provide forks for those that need proper tools. Try it here when in Little India, easy to get to by the Blue subway. Enjoy.
4
Komala Villas fulfills the Need of anyone yearning for genuine, South Indian food. The Seating & Ambience is wholly Functional, even Spartan - plastic cups are kept for drinking water. The Lunch served on Plantain Leaf is Superb - at a most reasonable price. Cleanliness & Neatness is maintained - no complaints but neither possible to compliment. Kamala Villas is Very Good Value-for-Money if you are keen to have Good South Indian Food
5
During my last visit to Singapore, I used to go to Komala villas restaurant for the dinner as I am vegetarian. Though there were many other vegetarian restaurants in Little India, I found food at Komala Villas very nice. There are two branches of Komala Villas restaurant in Little India and both tests equally good
1
Visited with family hoping for great south Indian vegetarian. While the food appeared up to the mark the experience was a let down as the ambience and hygiene leave a lot to be desired. Even if one forgives the typical dated udipi style ambience and the queue of clients waiting on the diner's head to be sat how does one forgive being given toilet paper roll to wipe wet plates and cutlery? What about the toilet itself? It's been awhile since I've seen a worse toilet in any restaurant in India let alone Singapore! Was completely wet and dripping and guess what had the same toilet paper which was apparently provided to us from here to clean our plates and cutlery. Do not recommend unless you can still stomach the food there after this review.
4
Decided to have breakfast, South Indian style.Tasty, well seasoned and certainly worth a try.Extremely budget ordinated. Cost for three persons was $12.00 Singapore.This is a no trills eating house...like you would find in India.Service - 3/5Food - 4/5Value - 5/
4
Competent dosa, medu vada & idli. Chutneys are good too. Self service. Staff at counter is efficient. Try the mango drink. Good place to eat before going on a shopping spree in Mustafa.
5
It's the original and the decor service and food are true to its roots. The dosa was amazing - thin, crispy and not greasy- and the masala filling perfect.
4
This is 5 mins by walk from Little India MRT. It is a small restaurant with 2 levels and purely vegetarian. Food taste was excellent. Accepts card and cash. restrooms are not maintained well. Closes at 11 PM
4
I go to this restaurant regularly for vegetarian food esp the one at Buffalo Rd. My Favourite is the podi thosai which was recommended by my Wife. Apart from that it's their authentic Indian coffee. Worth going. Value for money
4
Don't be expectignto just rock up and get a seat - especially if theres a large group. The food was so flavoursome and very reasonably priced. I normally eat meat with all my dinners but surprisingly left feeling very satisfied and filled up. the masala chai is a MUST! I went back a couple times just to get it to go. would definitely go again and will share with my friends who plan to visit. dont expect any fancy vibes though.
4
If your looking for South Indian food at value for money rates then this is the place to go,Have been visiting this restaurant since decades on every Singapore visit and this place still looks the same and food too is consistently good. Dont expect a fancy place and you wont be disappointed, good wholesome vegetarian fare at reasonable rates in Little India
4
We were looking for something less antiseptic in Singapore and so came as a family to Little India for lunch (children aged 15, 12 and 9). We chose Komala based on the reviews and can't make comparisons against other restaurantsWhat you get is cheap wholesome food in a restaurant popular with locals. The food was just fine - not spectacularly good, but then it's barely more expensive than the hawkersPortions are deceptively large, so it is easy to over order and if you do manage clean your plate a refill was never far away.
4
This is a busy place with very good food. We had the masala dosa and vadas and enjoyed them both thoroughly. Also had good masala tea. Service is quick and food is very good value. Made even more famous after Modi visit which was 2 days before us. Highly recommended
4
A warm and vibrant restaurant with a wide selection of dishes predominantly from south India. Authentic taste and fast service, reasonably priced. The area in which the restaurant is located is a busy and hectic place not for the feint hearted, especially after being greeted with Singapores sanitised and orderly approach. But none the less a place which has to be seen if one visits.
4
Good taste but the oldest in Indian veg food in Little India. Singapore PM entertained Indian PM here recently. THe food is good and the building is an old but refurbished building. Busy as ever due to its good food and publicity. Not that cheap though
4
Good south Indian menu, for the ones missing their South Indian delicacies. Worth a visit, but not a must do.
3
For cheap and best food, Komala villa is best, Personalize services, Felt eating like at home, must try.
1
Only southindian food is good but northindian food is terrible so im not want to visit there kailash parvat is good
5
I found Komala's food by far best in Little Indian region. Not heavy to pocket, you can get all variety of Indian food here.
4
the mid-day meal is awesome! with rice and variety of sides, it makes you drooling for more. Remind you, the food is unlimited though! All at a very affordable price.
4
This is a no frill restaurant, great value for money and very good south Indian food with filter coffee. Its crowded but worth waiting. Also found this neat and clean. Recommended for those who want to opt for Indian food during Singapore travel.
4
Go early in the morning. It's a no-frills place, but the food is delicious. Try the masala tea and dosai. The onion uthappam is also great for a hearty breakfast.
3
Ambience is alright, not that great. While eating lights went off. Electricity had tripped and the staff blamed it on the rain. Food takes reasonable time to prepare.Dosa are recommended here. We had the Mysore masala dosa, paper dosa and onion rava masala dosa. All were good, didn't disappoint. Staff were accommodating to the dosa being soft and crispy. Mango lassi was also good, not too sweet, just right. The chatnis of the dosa were good. 4 types of chatnisWe also ordered gobi Manchurian, that was good, but very oily. The roti prata with mock dock curry was disappointing. The prata was chewy and the curry was not very appetizing. Food cost is reasonable with the dosa varying from $4-$6.50. Good for cheap casual lunch
4
The food at Komala Villas reminded me of home. Simple, flavourful vegetarian food. We ordered the masala dosai and chickpea bhatura (this was very delicious). Service is okay but the service makes up for eat. Do not be fooled by the interior decor (or lack their of). The food more than makes up for this
3
This a good place to go, if you are in/ near Little India and would like a meal. The restaurant has a long list of items available, and is designed more like a fast-food court with multiple counters.So, you may have to pick your stuff from multiple counters to assemble a full meal.The South Indian/ Tamil dishes are good, though you do find dishes from other parts of India too
5
I've tried most of their foods. They are all awesome 10/10. Not to mention one of the cleanest place in Little India. Great customer service. Love the place.
3
Authentic & Cheap south Indian food available here.
Rawa masala Dosa is tasty.
Service is fast and restaurant is clean.
5
Absolutely authentic and very low priced, amazingly flavourful south Indian food in a humble atmosphere.
3
The food here is good especially their South Indian thali set. The coffee here is good and their other traditional South Indian tiffins. Worth for money.
4
Komala Vilas is a best place for meals. Its clean, hygenic and tasty as well. The prices are reasonable too.
The dosas are good too.
5
Quick and efficient Service, Excellent food, Good value for money. A must-go when you are in Little India.
4
excellent foods and quick service but typical staffs. It was fine! I fell in love with the garbanzo chutney. good quality and worth eating here.
4
Great service good food . Little India. Sit all together tourist and local Chinese and Hindus . Its crowd but you don't feel it. If you just wish for easy meal stay downstairs since upstairs there are larger meals and need to wait a lot in line. Don't forget to order mango lacy and chi masala at the end. Was great
4
The food was very good and the place had a nice friendly atmosphere with helpful and friendly staff. The prices were not very cheap but well worth the dinning experience. Next time I'm in Singapore, I now know where to go for Indian food and I would recommend it to everyone.
3
A good variety of indian dishes especially south indian.The service is efficient and the staff are helpful.It is a basic restaurant but the food is exceptional and plentiful.If you order a thali all the vegetable dishes are continuously topped up.The dosas are mouth watering and the masala tea with ginger gives a real boost
4
Good food and fast though its a indian cafe type..happy to go for quick one.
Clean and crisp.
Only thing is staff look very stress..dunno why? Other than that all good
4
Love the old set-up. Much preferred than the fast food style which has lost its touch as a nice diner. Good food. Samosas are great especially when served and eaten hot. Attentive staff. Reasonable price. Very much humbled diner.
5
A typical South India restaurant in Little India.Excellent food quality. Excellent breakfast and Lunch. I would suggest everyone to visit this hotel in Little India. Near to Little India MRT .
5
My favourite Indian vegetarian restaurant for over 30 years. Formica tables, TL lights, banana leaf and the old guy walking through the restaurant dealing food over the tables.
5
Went in here on our way home. Friendly & quick service & great samosas to take away. Would recommend - planning on heading back for dosas for breakfast.
5
We were in search of vegetables. We stopped in this quaint restaurant, sharing a table with another diner. We werent sure what to get so we let the waiter order for us. Everything was delicious and very affordable, we both got two meals and some mango lassi for under 25. They provided cutlery for us if we wanted. We felt very accomodated and welcome
5
We travelled to Singapore after a long visit to Greece and were ready for a change of diet. Komala Villas restaurant provided just that. In a vibrant upstairs restaurant we enjoyed this authentic place. Great food, perhaps it was just the month of Moussaka, etc., no alcohol and bustling diners eating with their fingers off banana leaves - not us, they gave us cutlery and plates. And cheap
5
I don't eat meat and I love Indian food - this restaurant takes vegetarian Indian food to a whole new level for me. There were 5 of us and we ordered so much food as we just couldn't choose what we wanted and we were not disappointed, the variety in the dishes, the flavours and taste were amazing and I was in heaven - just wish I could have took some of these recipes home to recreate the flavours - just wonderful! Also took some Indian sweets home as I couldn't resist
5
As soon as we checked in Sheraton, immediately we took a taxi and reached Little India, which is hardly 5 Kms and to my surprise, this part of the Singapore is entirely different from the rest of Singapore. You will find this hotel hardly 200 mts from the start of the Serangoon road. We had set of dosa and idly and to be very frank, we didn't felt the difference that we are in singapor
5
We didn't actually eat at Komala Villas in Serangoon Rd but at the original Komala Villas at 12 Buffalo Rd, opposite the Tekka Centre. This is the best vegetarian South Indian restaurant I have ever eaten at. Great service, amazing food and a real authentic feel. My daughter has eaten at the Seragoon Rd restaurant and says the menu is exactly the same, but I think it would be impossible to beat the original.
5
Komala Villas is clearly one of those places that has been around and will continue to do so. The food is amazing, the staff friendly and the setting unpretentious. We had the Chappathi plate, vegetable biryani and some dosai. You won't be disappointed!
4
A typical South India restaurant in Little India. The interior and the service is similar to a restaurant south India. The food Quality is Good. Will Recommend the Filter Coffee, Nothing Like having a great Filter Coffee from here in the morning.
5
Fantastic place. Real food, great atmosphere. The best restaurant in Singapore for vegetarian food. Try the "rice meal"; 9 different dishes, on a banana leaf for $8.50.
4
Came here when I visited Singapore back in the 80s and the place hadn't changed a bit .
Loved the food. The staff.
Good to see that some good things hasn't changed....
5
After a long day we reached the restaurant and ordered thalis. Ate to our heart content. The restaurant is clean and tidy and the food was equally nice :)
5
Best Indian food ever..less than $10 for two lunches. Quick service. Excellent experience. Would recommend to anyone.
3
When in Little India a visit to KVR is recommended for it's variety of dishes and sweetmeats at reasonable prices. Can be crowded, but service is usually good and very polite.
3
I have been to this plate now more then 3 times. i must say I have never been moved by there food but also not disappointed ever. The food is average some stuffis really tasty like chole bhature, gobi manchurian. But some dishes like manchurian are only available post 6 . Its a good place for quick food . South Indian food is good. Service is really quick
4
I come across this place on my way to Mustafa Center. Actually I went to this place because I once had an authentic Indian lunch with my Indian friend back in Jakarta, where he told me a lot of things about how to enjoy Indian food, and I think that I will have the chance to sample authentic Indian food once more at a reasonable price.When I enter the place, I see that the service is quite efficient, you pick your food and pay at the cashier, and move to another counter to pick up your food. I pick the "South Indian Meal" there for SGD 7.90, and my food was ready in less than 3 minutes.As I am not familiar with the names of each food on my tray, I could not describe them one by one, but in general the taste of the food is OK, and the portion is big (I could not finish up the rice). I also prefer to eat by spoon there, although I observe that most of the people around me eat with bare hands.Overall, the taste is good, the service is efficient, and I see a lot of other people come and go, employees, families, older couples, etc
3
Maybe I don't understand the fantasticness of this food (or is it fantasticity?), since we are only at the beginning of feeling our way through ethnic cuisines of Singapore, but food here seemed, while curious, not particularly diverse. The centre stage of the meal was a huge blurb of rice, which tasted like... rice. Not spicy at all. Lassi was good though. We, as Westerners, were given forks instead of eating by hand. Initially it felt disappointing, but ultimately proved to be a good thing
5
Had paper dosa and idli in dinner with my mom here. We simply loved the food.. very authentic.. priced reasonably
5
A visit to Komala Villas is a must when in Little India. The ambiance is so true that once inside you cannot make out not being in India. The food taste is authentic South Indian and prices too are light on the pocket.
5
For the people who expect both cleanliness and tastey food... This is the place
Pocket friendly....
They have good menu and staff was really good.
4
Good for South Indian vegetarian family Staffs are mostly North indians and just opposite to Ferrer Park MRT (Railway Station)
5
The place is located next to a hindu temple in little india. The portions are huge and taste is exceptional. One must try Bathora platter as well as i love their moti choor lados as desert
5
Ate several times here. If you have been to south india and love the vege food experience you will love this place. Wonderful thali dosai iddli and puri etc. Attentive and prompt service with lots of head wiggling. Will be back
5
My photography group decided to have lunch at Komala Villas on Serangoon road in Lt India. We were directed to first floor which only serves set meals during lunch. We ordered the all you can eat Rice Plate which came with 2papads rice, two vegetables, 2 types of lentils, yogurt, a soup , a sweet dessert , and a vada. $8.00 per head and you could request any item as much as you wanted. No sharing allowed. Excellent food, fresh and tasty. Highly recommended for vegetarians
4
Located very near Mustafa as well as Farrer Road MRT station is this small and nice restaurant. We had Vegetable Biryani and Dosa, quantity as well as quality were good. Food was served fast though its self service unlike Ananda's or Saravana Bhavan. Price was in line with other restaurants
4
We had food at this restaurant a couple of times. Service is good....they messed up on our order once, but immediately changed the food once we pointed out the mistake. We thought variety of food was less than the other hotels around Little India. Most of the Hotels in Singapore (that we visited) were self service
5
This is one place we loved in Singapore. This is located strategically on the Serangoon main road just few steps from famous Mustafa Center.Food is excellent...authentic South Indian taste with courtesous service. Even the take aways are packed very neatly to the International standards.I recommend this place to every one who love Indian foo
3
Not as good as Murgan Idlis. The sambar is good. The Vadas hard. The puma and rava dosa was good.
The coffee was also good.
5
Nice south indian food option in Little india, Singapore . we had dinner there during our visit. the meal and dosa is really authentic
4
Show up mid afternoon and order up all the pretty indian desserts heaped in the display cases on the ground floor. The sugar rush is enough to keep you bouncing off the wall the next several hours. Perfect if you are an athlete and needing a sugar high.This place specialises in south indian food, eat with your right hand. The humble meal with rice (atop the banana leaf) is eaten with 4 or 5 very nice vegetarian viands. Servers ladle extra servings of rice or viands into your plate if you ask. Loved the dahl specially, also have the tea or lassi to wash things down. The crisp bread-like dosai in all its variants, are not to be missed. Makes for a very satisfying meal worth repeating if in the neighborhood.This place gets packed by happy, large indian families so try to come in before or after the dinner rush
5
This eatery in Singapire in Little India caters to all those who have a craving for an authentic dish .On any given day the locals and the outsiders alike come here to eat . Prices are low and , there is no frills here - self service . The ideal location is an added advantage 
4
We weren't really looking for somewhere in Little India to eat and were really walking through to get to the MRT after the place we had intended to eat didn't have a high chair for our toddler.We love vegetarian Indian and the staff were so accommodating when we ducked in that we were soon settled at a table.Ordering was easy and the staff were helpful. We had vegetarian biryani and a thali as well as some naan.One of our favourite places to eat in Singapore is Naalan near Raffles City, but the food at Komala Villas is, perhaps, better.Pricing is very good and, if the number of customers in there is any indication, it is popular with the locals.Highly recommended if you are in Little India
3
We came here for breakfast for few times. Small, budget restaurant with good varieties of South Indian food. It is usually crowded but little more cleanliness would make this a better place. Service levels are good but place is less clean, and crowded. Food quality is ok
4
We tried another vege place (Ananda Bhavan) which was not as good as this one. Nice atmosphere with an indian family running the place. South Indian Thali (rice meal) was really good, cone dosa good, nann nice, although the vadas were not straight from the cooker so were a bit soggy and cold. Good value and will try again when in Singapore again
1
I love Indian and after reading previous reviews I was looking forward to eating here. I really don't mind what the place looks like just as long as the food tastes good and unfortunately it wasn't good or cheap. In one short sentence "the food lacked flavour".Last year I went to Malaysia and I have to say eating at the Indian Hawker Centres in KL was a sensation for the taste buds. I was expecting the same in Singapore and it just didn't deliver
5
My partner had reservations about visiting a vegetarian restaurant - but boy are we glad we did.This no frills restaurant served impeccable food with flavours to blow the mind.We had samosas to start - a large portion with dips for 3sgd. There was a firey kick that warmed the mouth without upsetting the belly and the filling was warm and flavoursome.Whilst the samosa were divine we regretted ordering as so filling and our eyes were bigger than our bellies.I had the dosa masala set and the boy had the chapatti set: both 8sgd and HUGE!Served on banana leaf we received 3 large portions of veg curry each and they were accompanied with a variety of tasty tips, and of course our respective dosa and chappati.My dosa was perfect - crisp on the outside and melt in the mouth in the middle. Stuffed with masala potato it was a taste explosion.For approx a fiver GBP a head we were full, content and as I write this; contemplating going back for breakfast!Don't fixate on aesthetics - live life and explore... best find of our trip
4
Komala villas offers a large menu of strictly vegetarian Indian dishes, such as massala dosa, tomato uttapam, onion uttapam, idli, puri, batthura etc. The food is really tasty, and it is extremely cheap! They are open from 0700 - 2200 daily, and also serve take away
4
Food delicious, average price, good service. Very helpful and polite staff serving the customers. Restaurant embien not too cold neither hot
5
This is a very good place to eat for Indian vegetarian people. This restaurant is very good in terms of service, food quality, cost & ambience. Indian tourists can have good quality food over here, at low prices.
4
This is just so close to Park Royal on Kitchener road and you get good options and the quantity is also good.One of the good restaurants in Little India
5
During our stay for 3 days we had our breakfast and dinner in this hotel. the food is very taste, served hot, neatly maintained, service is excellent and people are very polite.
3
Good Vegetarian food we can get here. Price bit okay.
Small place , i feel bit congested in the dining area.
has to be improve hygienic level
5
Fantastic Southern Indian vegetarian food - used to eat here with my family in the '60s when we lived in Singapore and make a point of going every visit since. Never dissapoints!
5
Found this lovely vegetarian Indian restaurant on a visit to Little India. Excellent food and service, so much food we couldn't eat it all, and the waiter kept refilling our plates! Great value for $$, $9 Singapore for a plate with rice, 3 curries, sauces and poppadums
5
Not that easy to navigate the menu here if you're not familiar with southern Indian food, but fortunately we were. Order and pay at the counter and give your receipt to the waiter.We had a couple of different sets, including the vegetable briyani and the normal rice set. Each came with slightly different vegetables, but mostly were the same except for the rice. Regardless, all were delicious! Sweet lassi and the plain dosa were also great. This is a cheap and fulfilling place, with no frills service but fab food
1
This was my 5th visit to Singapore. I always admired the restaurant for it's good South Indian Food. However the insensitive approach of one of it's staff towards customer is quite surprising. I've seen this happening to other customers in my previous visit, however, this time me & my family was at the receiving end. I ordered Dosa for my six year old son & handed over the token to serving person at the counter. I waited for 20 minutes in vain. However, I noticed that persons who ordered dosa after me were served first. I politely asked him for my order & to my surprise he ensured to make me wait for another 15 minutes. I went to the counter & requested to cancel my order as I had to rush to catch flight back home. On seeing this the person at the serving counter shouted on me at his peak using derogatory remarks. This kind of behaviour of that particular person (unable to recall his name) is highly unacceptable. If I recall correctly I've seen him misbehaving often with the tourist. I personally feel that the owner should counsel him to behave properly
5
love love loveeee the dosais here.first and last place in Singapore for vegetarian indian food.the syrup ice tea was nice as well and the hot chai.but just please try the dosais with the various chutneys and dips provided.the restaurant is crowded and cramped, the staff aren't especially friendly but just go for the food
3
The quality of food was average. If one is looking for Tamil meals go for Saravan Bhavan for better food.
4
If you are really longing for south indian food this is placce serving decent food. with little india not too far away, one could venture in there and find nicer places. overall, a fairly good breakfast.

Excellent food even to Indian standards. Prices are pretty competitive for Singapore.
Service is fast and customization is taken care of. Worth a visit. There are at least two joints in Little India, very close to the MRT.
4
I visited the Little India joint. Its a little crowded all through the day and rightfully so. The food they serve is really amazing. Highly recommended.
5
One of the best meals in my life! I ordered dosai meal that was served on banana leaf and masala tea. Presentation of my food was beautiful. People from other tables were taking photos of my foodâ€¦that tells you a lot!Food is great, service fast and bill very low
5
Had food there a few times and it was good but little priced high. It is located in the middle of little india area and is a vegetarian restaurant. Dosa's , chola poori, paratha are good. Restaurant is clean and the billing girl is cute !
5
This is where we had breakfast daily during our 5-days stay at Little India. We tried different kinds of dosas all of which were yummy, especially the Rawa dosai. The restaurant is quite clean and the prices reasonable. Make sure you go to the right place as there are restaurants with similar names at Little India
1
I visited the restaurant on Saturday, last week with my friend. Since the ground floor was full the person there asked us to go upstairs. When we reached on the I floor, the person in-charge there refused to serve Dosa and said that we have to go downstairs as they serve only meals there. The way he responded was very rude.I told him that there is no space and the person downstairs has only asked us to sit here. The experience was very bad and I had to return without even eating. The staff doesn't know how to well behave with their customers. I have decided never to visit this place again
5
Appreciate the promoter to have been able to meet or i should say exceed the expectations of an south indian traveler..My kids just loved their crispy dosas & wify loved their vadas, curd vadas...I simply indulged in their special south indian meals...We were regulars for almost 5 days for every lunch & dinner out here.
3
Used to patronise this restaurant at least two-three times a week for quality vegetarian food until service irks me so much I stopped patronising. Many tourists visit this place and I would still recommend tourists to try their vegetarian food despite their poor service. One of the best vegetarian food I'd say in the area, with good variety of selection.
4
Nice taste. I loved their rava dosai. Very very fast service. Staff is courteous. Ambience need not be good at the cost at which they service. Visit the one which is besides Ananda bhavan at the beginning of Serangoon road
2
ok type of food , with average food ..... . but staff is very good & helpful. I had samosa chat , which was good , but uttapam is not good at all ,,,,its very thick with raw taste .
4
I had the breakfast here which is near temples in Serangoon Road and the taste was really awesome same as the taste here in Tamilnadu
2
Notably poor service towards locals, food is of average standard. Won't go unless elsewhere is full.
Tourists please don't judge Singapore based on this restaurant.
5
For Masala Thosai, you csnt go wrong with this place. Always packed and those ordering for take out. Dont be fool as they have seatings upstairs too. Take your pick of Indian food and make sure you have that spare space in your tummy. They pile those side dishes like you never seen before. Masala Thosai are paper thin, crispy and boy O boy....the fillings inside bloats you so full. Wash down with their Lassi. Cost is value for money and dont be frustrated for not able to get a seat. This place is famous that they have other joints under the same name. However head for their main outlet in Little India. Food more tastier than the outlets combine
5
We love this south India restaurant since 1978 we are visiting this Restaurent there are some changes but we still love it ,Must try this place when in Singapore I love to travel from HongKong just to eat in Singapore I miss South Indian healthy food always and my favorite places are Komala Vilas Restaurent and know also MTR Thanks keep up the spirit of south

Before heading out to Little India for food, I decided to have a look on Trip Advisor for a budget restaurant selling good Indian food. This one came up high on the list and now I know why. For me and my partner, it was the best meal we'd had in Singapore on our travels!We each had the chapatti meal, which included 3 chapatti, 3 veg dishes, dhal, some yoghurty good stuff and a poppadom. We also ordered a side of palak (saag) paneer to share. We washed it down with a masala tea (chai). They realised we were westerners and brought us a spoon to eat with, but we decided to go Indian and eat with our fingers, scooping up the food with our chapattis. 2 hours later and we are still stuffed! The portions are pretty generous. The meal in total came to S$28.60. That's Â£7 each for Brits. Taking into consideration the amount of foos we had, it only worked out slightly more expensive than a hawker centre, but way more tasty! Certainly worth the trip. If it sounds like something you'd like, then try it - you won't regret it.Tips:Take your own tissues or wet wipes.Note that people who eat with their hands normally use just their right hand (because the left hand is reserved for cleaning oneself after using the toilet traditionally, and is deemed dirty), so just be aware of that - it is just a cultural norm. Water is available on the tables and is free of charge.To get there by MRT, travel to Little India station and follow signs to Buffalo Road exit. Walk down Buffalo Road to the end and turn left onto Serangoon. You will see the restaurant on the right hand side about 10-20 meters down the road. (They also have a smaller restaurant on Buffalo Road in between some of the fruit/veg/grocery shops.:

We ate twice at Komala Villa for very good reason, the food is DELICIOUS even our fussy kids couldn't get enough of the dishes we had at the Komala Villa. If you want real Indian food, not the the garbage you are served back home you have to try the Komala Villa.
5
We have been here a couple of times already and love this place. It's wholly vegetarian, and serves delicious and tasty food at excellent prices. The place is very simple, you might get to share a table, but it is very genuine, full of locals. And the food, to repeat, is very satisfying - you can choose simple dosai meals, or 'set meals' which are very filling. In any case, it's full of flavour and not too heavy! Highly recommended
5
Best bang for your buck in Little India! Obviously makes no sense to compare KV to expensive/proper dining places, but if you are looking for authentic Indian food in an authentic setting (by that I mean an Indian-style restaurant in Kolkata catering to locals, not some fancy-shmancy tourist trap in Mumbai) for ridiculous money, Komala Villas is your best bet.We have tried several others (veg and non-veg), but even though we are not vegetarians, we could not find anything better! We are fond of a lot of different cuisines very well represented in S'pore (thai, malay, japanese, korean, fusion etc), still ending up eating here most of the time..
3
they have range of indian cuisine..... taste good curry.... good option for those vegetarian people.... location easy to find
4
Had all the typical south indian snacks like, iddly, dosa etc at various visit.
Cheap and healthy, easy on belly and pocket.
Coffee not as good as in Chennai, tea ok.
4
We went to the location near the Little India MRT station. The food reminded me of my extended stay in Bangalore. Better than the (good) cafeteria food but not quite as good as the good restaurants. But that still makes it much better than the Indian restaurants I've been to anywhere else. We ate a lot of food (including a couple of northern style dishes) for about SGD 40. And it was fun being the only non-Indians
4
I went there, because it was close yo my hostel and I read many good reviews about this place. I wasn't disappointed! The food was really good, cheap and I was the only white guy in the restaurant - the rest of the people there were Hindu and it was full. Eat where the locals eat. Totally recommend it
5
If you are a vegetarian, bored of eating junks of breads and other stuff, horribly craving for Indian food, then this is the place in Singapore to fill in your belly and satiate your taste buds...Food is simply good, sumptuous and fairly priced. Try once and I bet you will every like to visit once more
4
Been years since i ate here, so my bf & I decided to go vegetarian on a sunday afternoon.This place is almost always filled. But that's cause the food is really good! So if you're hungry, & you need vegetarian indian meal, you have to try this place! Not big customer service or ambience, but even on a very busy lunch hour sunday, we didn't hv to wait long. We both ordered the Vegetarian Rice Meal Set, couple of iced milo & a soft drink. Total was about $18.& let me tell you, im not a fan of any kind of vegetable. So I surprised myself whn i actually finished everything on my plate. The paper dosa is also great, their vadai is perfect. Writing this review makes me want to go again tomorrow! Thank you for a great lunch you guys!

My family & I visited this restaurant whilst recently holidaying in Singapore. My husband is originally from India & was really looking forward to 'authentic' Indian Dosai. We caught the train to Little India & was surprised how many restaurants we had to choose from. We found the Komala Villas Restaurant on one of the main roads. We ordered Masala Dosai (one each to eat now & a couple of extra to take back to our apartment for later). Without doubt these were the BEST Dosai we had ever eaten. We were all quite hungry when we got there but found after one dosai each we were full to overflowing. The staff could have smiled a little & the restaurant itself is a little worn but once we were served our yummy dosai we didn't really care! Each dosai cost under $4 each so very good for the budget conscious traveller. Before we left we also bought a couple of the Indian sweets which were also very nice. We would happily recommend this restaurant to any other dosai lover
5
I had never had a breakfast of Indian food, but wanted to try it in Little India. Komala Vilas is on the main drag, Serangoon, so it's easy to find. They have several Dosa (crepes) options and I asked the food server to recommend one for me. The potato Dosa was excellent; so filling I missed lunch. I asked for coffee and it came very sweet. If, like me, you typically do not put sweetener in your coffee I would recommend sticking the with water pitcher on the table. The staff was not the friendliest, but once I got my food I didn't care. The place started really filling up around 10am. Like with most of Singapore restaurants, I could not believe the inexpensive costs
5
One of the best south indian vegetarian meal in singapore. They serve very authentic and good quality food.The price wise it is not too expensive. I'm visiting this restuarant from past 12 years but the taste remains the same.The staffs are very friendly and care about customers. The varieties of dosa are available
4
Very very authentic old school style type of place , full of locals ,no cutlery eat with your fingers and tuck in ! Cheap lovely Mysore dosa and a sweet lassi . Make sure you visit here to see how things were done years and years ago
5
Have visited this place umpteen number of times and till date have never been disappointed . Kothu parotta and wheat Dosai highly recommended
5
I have visited here multiple times on each of my visits and every time I loved the food. Good quality south indian food served hot and great service.
A place to make sure you visit if you like Indian food
3
A cheap and cheerful Indian vegetarian fast food place. The dosai are excellent, the atmosphere noisy and the service gruff... The downstairs cashier is just plain rude.
1
Had heard great reviews of this place but it turned out to be a terrible experience. The restaurant was stinking with bins overflowing and wash basins clogged.... Avoid this place, there are better places in Singapore for south indian fare...
5
The best South Indian vegetarian food outside India. It is a very busy restaurant, with no bookings, and may have to wait a while to get a seat. It is great value and very tasty food!
3
Diverse menu but they serve the same things more or less. We ordered for a biryani combo and the north indian thali. But both were ditto. Nice food. Prices on the higher side. They specialise in south indian delicacies. Bank opposite city square mall
4
The place serves up one of the best South Indian cuisine in Singapore at really cheap rates. The best part about the place is that it is not Singapore a Singaporean Indian place and serves actual Indian food which you would get in India . Must try for people who want to taste really good authentic South Indian food
5
The food here is excellent south Indian. The customers appear to be 75% local so it must be good. Everything was very good, and the dosai are fantastic. Try the rose milk. The mango lassi was also excellent.The waiters are helpful, efficient, and very pleasant. Comfortable restaurant for a woman eating alone. My only disappointment was they didn't sell the shirts that the waiters were wearing. What a good souvenir that would have been
4
Our first day in Singapore, and suffering from jetlag, we needed some tasty, filling food quickly.Found this vegetarian restaurant in Little India and it was extremely busy so we thought we'd give it a try.My other half had a Rava Dosa and I had an Uttapam. Both were very authentic, served with Sambal and two chutneys. Really tasty foodA really filling meal, for less than SG$10 - amazing. Definitely somewhere we'd visit agai
5
A very good option for south india breakfast. Only the taste of Sambar is not indian. But the taste of sambar what we get in India hotels is not available anywhere in Singapore.....dont understand why.....But the taste of food items is real good...a very good option for indian travellers at kitchener roa
5
I've been to Komala Villas many times and the food is always excellent especially the masala dosa, my personal favourite.
4
First time I tasted food in KomalaVilas in 1977 & several time thereafter. Recently again in Dec'14 & found it lovely. RKSharma from Jakarta
4
This a famous restaurant chain in Singapore famed for Vegetarian food.
Prices are above average but the food quality is food.
Good for families.
4
I always go for a good indian breakfast after prayers every Thursday.
The staff and the cashier always without fail gives me a welcome smile.
varieties of breakfast served and the bru coffee is a must for me with every meal.
5
Do yourself a favour and find this place... The food is delicious and incredibly reasonable.. We took a toddler and a teen for breakfast and we found food to suit everyone's spice meter!
5
Great place for vegetarian south indian fare. Hop in for light breakfast or large sized meals. Great value for money and great service too.
4
I went here with 3 friends on a Sunday night. It was busy but the service was fast and the food really nice.
3
We had to wait in long queue to get breakfast. The south indian breakfast was tasty with 3 items and unlimited tea/ coffee. Avoid when indian tours are here.
4
In Singapore looking for food that too in banana Leaf.....pl be here. Have hot hot rice along with Poriyal & Sambar of the day. you will feel proud after having food here, simply bcoz what u have at ur native ......will be here withour any change in taste. Be on time to secure ur place
5
Visited and dined at 2 authentic Indian cuisine restaurants frequently in recent months. This is one of them. The nan with raisin was great; bryanni rice fragrant and fresh; local fish-head curry finger-licking; the list goes on. The only complaint is the service staff shortage during peak hours. It took about 15 mins before our food was served after we got seated. There is a huge car park across the road. For those travelling by subway, alight at Tekka station and walk about 10 minutes. Suggest for lunch one arrive before 12 or after 2. Top-block. Highly recommended
5
Had been to Singapore in Nov. .n my I was delighted to Hv authentic Indian food..The dosa was just crispy enough n the coffee was brewed to perfection. .The kids loved it too.m
4
We were excited to find this south indian restaurant in Singapore. Offers quite a great variety of Indian foods, we expecially liked the dosas and used to go there for breakfast.
4
Had a lovely meal and as always enjoyed the food. The thali is really served well and the waiter served us with pleasure which made it still better.
4
The breakfast has the usual options of idli, dosa, puri, chapathi, upma etc. The lunch/dinner have meal options. The place gets crowded in the evenings, and there maybe waiting.The service is fast and without hitches. It is close to the Little India MRT.
4
I was here in this restaurant for couple of times and the food served here was good. Even at closing time also they served hot and tasty meals here.
5
I doubt if any vegetarian or a a food lover has not had a meal or two at Komala Villas. One cant miss this outlet on Serangood road. With branches all over the island and in some other countries as well, its by far one of the best south indian fast food chains I have come across. I dont like the North indian fare on offer at Komala's but the South Indian meals, snacks and the chhole bhature are worth trying. a must try if you come across this local home grown Singapore chai
4
My husband and I were looking for some authentic Indian food in Little India and we found it! We split the alook paneer and the chana masala along with some cheese naan for lunch. Delicious! Hubby even found cinnamon bark in his chana. Wish we had also ordered the mushrooms also at this vegetarian restaurant. Hopefully there will be a next time
3
I saw number of reviewers writing great things about this restaurant which tempted me to try this restaurant. Sure it is a vegetarian restaurant but finding a vegetarian restaurant in Singapore is that very difficult as has been made out by some of the reviewers. But I was very much disappointed by not only the food but the ambience, hygiene and cleanliness. You are heralded like sheep to any empty space on any table. No it is not done. I know many people might disagree with my views but that is what I experienced. Mind it the food too is not that cheap. And the food and ambience is much better at another restaurant of similar name in this Little India. It was much below my expectations Sorry
5
One of the highlights of our trip to Singapore was the food, and especially the food at Komala Vilas! One of the cheapest meals we had here and also one of the tastiest, with plenty of choice for us vegetarians. Try the masala chai tea and some of the Indian desserts. Delicious
4
It is a real nightmare for pure vegetarian Indians to find out a suitable restaurant for their lunch and diner in Singapore. Thank God we found Komala in Little India...The preparations are very good and the service too...Ms. Anju Arora at order booking counter is really very helpful who explains you the menu, in case you get confused among the variety of south Indian and Punjabi dishes. Only area of improvement can be the space, which is little untidy...but that some times make it a perfect location as it looked like any other Restaurant (fast food center) of any Indian town...Good job done Komala..Keep it up
5
One of my favorite restaurants in Singapore - loved the opportunity to eat with my hands on a banana leaf. It's a bit of a hike to get to this place, but well worth it!
5
Little more expensive than other local restaurants but this one has a lot more choice all through the day. Quality of the food is great. Try out their sweets!
3
From the dosas to the thalis, all items were yummy, with huge servings and easy on the pocket. The best part was the masala chai, though.
4
Been visiting this awesome, authentic South Indian restaurant since 1999! I guess, that in itself is a big enuf n self explanatory statement! Awesome South indian food!!
5
Very simple decor but the prices do reflect this. We visited this restaurant on our last visit to Singapore and enjoyed it so much, decided to try it again. I went for the paneer in a spinach gravy. Delicious. The service is very prompt. Nothing fancy, good honest indian food
4
We found this place while walking in Little India; it’s bigger than you think because there is second floor. One dish we had was Paper Masala Dosa, large thin flat bread folded over that was as wide as the table! (see photo). It came with tikka masala sauce, lentil and a creamy milky sauce, which was unlike anything I’d tasted in the states (I expected it to be raita). It was good but the portion was too large. The other dish was chappathi with ochre, lentil, tikka masala and squash with three types of bread. With two lassies, it was two great meals for <20 SGD
5
We went to this restaurant following the tripadvisor rating. To be honest, we would probably not have entered this restaurant when walking by as it looks - well how to say best, hmmm... quite origin/ "simple". To make a long story short... We ordered several meals and when finished we started again and ordered some more :)) Even the kids were very happy. Everything tasted soooo good plus excellent price. Highly recommended!!
5
Nothing fancy going on here, but if you like south Indian done right at value prices you're at the right place. I've been here in '02, '10 and again now. It hasn't changed one bit. I recommend the sambar vada, paper Dosa and mango lassi. Upstairs is a bit nicer for the sit down rice dinner. But again simple service, excellent food and great value
3
I was visiting after a gap of over 10 years, and clearly the standard and quality has deteriorated. The food was downright bland. I can understand this when an Indian restaurant caters to the Western crowd in the West, but it is totally unacceptable in the heart of Little India. The idlis were good enough, but the sambhar and the chutneys were insipid. The rava masala dosa was outright inedible. And they committed one of the blasphemies of South Indian cuisine by adding carrots to the masala. Just not done. The Uttappam looked interesting only to deceive in the taste.Head over to Saravana Bhavan, Murugan or even Ananad Bhavan for truly authentic souith Indian cuisine
1
The food was cheap. There's the positive. Downsides: Service was very poor. Gestures rather than speaking, not even acknowledging the order. We both felt very unwelcome, and like they just wanted to get us out. The food arrived quickly, but it was cold, and of pretty average quality. Nothing to write home about, and I've had far far better. They had reviews on the wall praising their excellent food and service - unless they just don't like tourists/white people, we didn't see any of that. Avoid
4
Is a no nonsense quick and satisfying place for south Indian food.The meals are extensive and filling.
5
One word for the food is "awesome" at the given prices compared to others in Singapore. South Indian is best here one must try. Badam Milk is also good one to try.note: Its pure Vegetarian restaurant. Service is also very quick and prompt here..
4
Good south indian food options at reasonable prices. We also use them for delivery, a bit slow though. Taste wise above average but food always fresh and service prompt.
Nice place to grab a Masala Dosa or a plate of Idly.
5
been a few yrs since i moved out and went there but had visited this place atleast once a mnth for abt 12yrs!! goood indian food, south indian thali specially! very affordable and generous quantities..after a day in cbd/orchanrd/ecp this place brought u to a bygone indian era :) my parents favorite for nearly two decades
3
This restaurant is like a fast food restaurant but with Indian food. It is bustling with people and it literally took 2 minutes from ordering the food to it arriving on our table. The choice for vegetarians is great as this can be tough in Singapore, but the quality was basic. Good value though and nice freshly squeezed juices.
2
- If you have tried authentic south Indian food, this joint is no match for the same.- Has decent menu but preparations are inconsistent- I would love to see more variety and better quality of condiments(read chutneys/typical south Indian sauces) to accompany the dishes.- The North Indian food/chaat offered can be skipped for better options elsewhere. - The Coffee was also OK and no match for the authentic South Indian Filter coffee. For some reason the coffee served was pretty cold(can assure you i hadn't ordered for a cold coffee though :-)
3
I went to this restaurant for dinner along with a friend. We ordered a couple of south indian meals. The vegetables were nice, but were quite oily. The sambhar and kolumbu was really good. We also ordered a plate of banana bajjis and got soggy and tasteless onion bajjis instead. The waiter on service refused to acknowledge his mistake and mentioned that he had got the onion bajjis because the banana bajjis were over! We also ordered mango milkshake and that was really nice.The quantity of food in general was good and overall experience was ok, but the wrong bajji and subsequent behavior of the staff left a bad taste in mouth
4
(People seem to be confusing the various branches of this restaurant, but here I'm referring to the original "HQ" in Serangoon Road. To reach it from the Little India MRT takes about 5 minutes on foot. If you get lost, just ask anyone Indian in the area, it's very well-known.)Now, this place is not fancy, but does have rustic wooden touches in its interior and is quite authentic. Depending on what time you get there, it may be slightly crowded.The food is reliably good, and is cheap. The dosas and naans are their specialty and are great when washed down with hot masala tea (which is a bit on the sweet side, ask them to tone it down if you want it less sweet.)Not absolutely the best south Indian vegetarian fare, but consistently good and fresh. If you are shopping in Little India, this is worth considering for breakfast or lunch
4
Komala Villas seems to get some mixed reviews on TripAdvisor and I can see why. The food is simple and the decor is very basic too. It's a rough and ready restaurant selling affordable food, so you have to go in there expecting that. I go to Komala Villas every time I visit Singapore because I love the simple, tasty food and I love the rough interior of the place. It's all part of the experience for me. That said, I've never been to India so I don't claim to know how authentic the food is. But for me, it's really delicious. My favourite is the masala dosai - it's absolutely delicious and so well-priced. Komala Villas pretty famous in Singapore, it has been around since the 40's and everyone knows about it. Don't go here for a romantic meal with your sweetheart or a first-class food experience. Go here for a more local experience
2
I was completely misled by the best rating given here on TA, and went there with a lot of expectations. I was so disappointed that it did not even measure up to even the average food served in major cities in India. Very basic food served simply at reasonable prices. I would never go here again !
2
had visited komalas for dinner but was very disappointed. we had masala dosa and hole bhatura.
The quantity of chole was almost negligible . the restaurant was quiet dirty.
5
The food was superb it reminded me of India the dosa and idly and chutneys were outstanding in our next visit we would like to dine here only in totality Singapore is outstanding country with a very fast development
5
Had a snack in the afternoon here with family. Good food! Would recommend to go for a cheap meal. Had the cheese dosai. I was expecting paneer but it was normal cheese. Still good flavours.
4
We stopped in here for a thosai and a palak paneer and got a good version. The thosai was good - crispy and thin with a softer centre. The side sauces went very well with it and they were flavourful. The Palak paneer was well done and the spinach was very creamy. It is a cheap, but decent place with good food and good hygiene. Definitely earns its reputation
4
It was as though we were back in India! The delicious dosai and set meals are amazing value and huge! Marsala chai was refreshing and spicy, finish off this great meal with a sweet from the Indian sweet counter! Yeeeeummm! Definitely recommend this cheap clean restaurant & we ate mostly at our first choice Komala Villas just up the road on the delightful Buffalo Road on the way to the M.R.T, both are good but we found the Buffalo Rd. restaurant more relaxed & friendly
2
It serves indian fast food (south and north indian) Taste is good but Cleanliness is a big issue ... There was uncleared vomit at basin in main dining room . Dirty dustbin located in dining room . Filthy floors. About food hygiene : is a big concern.Food quality : at times very oily and unhealthy. Better option are avaliable for indian food!!! Good for money savers who don't care for health ...
4
Good, no frills Indian food that comes out quick and at a decent price. When I arrived and saw that it was full of Singaporeans of all ethnicities I knew I made the right choice. I left happy and full and I now know why it is something of an institution
4
The dosais at Komala Villas are excellent...choice of paper dosais, masala dosai, rava onion dosai etc with tasty chutney. There were 5 of us there for brunch and we ordered various things from dosais to iddiappam, somoas, sweets etc. We enjoyed the experience and it was cheap, tasty and huge portions. We didn't enjoy the teas - too sweet for us! The restaurant does get noisy and people do share tables with other patrons, which surprised us! We went there for the food and weren't disappointed, the service was fast and efficient
4
This place is your cheap Indian fast food type of joint. Don't expect anything fancy with service or ambience. The potato masala dosai that we had however was extremely good and was bursting with flavours. Would definitely go back again just for that when we pass by Singapore in the future.
2
Komala Villas is apparently known for cheap South Indian 'fast food'. I went there in March 2013 - the food was ok. Iddiappam was great, fresh and delicious! But the lassi made me sick sick sick. Now in May 2014, I almost forgot about my experience last year and ordered home deliver - big mistake: onion rava masala dosa- terrible, iddiappam - terrible, dry, no condiments, puri sabji - terrible.Moral of the story - don't get delivery. When your there make sure whatever your getting is cooked fresh. Don't have milky drinks (or have them if you must at your own risk). There are much better places to eat in Singapore for similar food and prices
3
I had dosa and uttapam, it was alright. Value for money food. Order only typical south-Indian cuisine. Generally they are about to close at 10 pm, so not much options available.
5
The cost can be almost same as foods in foodcourt.However, quality and atmosphere are much better.It is worth visiting if you visit to little india.It takes only few minutes from MRT station.
4
Good place to visit for south india food in singapore, went for dinner two days during our stay . Food is authentic and reasonably priced !!
4
Serve very good Indian food, hips of verities and services is great. Upstairs is quite and clean more tables for couples. Highly recommend for foreigners who like s to try Indian food.
3
There was a lot of hype about Komala Vilas as being a true south Indian chain of restaurant. I was totally disappointed with the Dosas that I ordered. The dosas were not crisp and the sambhar was tasteless.
4
This place has a good food and tastes like home made food. Unlimited lunch/dinners, pretty reasonable price. One of my frequently visited spots.
4
For a vegetarian, who wishes to have a good quality meal at an affordable price, this is the place! They have a wide variety to choose from and also provide quick service. If you visit it once, you would surely visit it again and again....
4
We went to this hotel near little India accidently. The south indian preparations such as idly and dosa were good. Ambiance avarage, but clean. Later, when we want to try another restaurant catering south indian cuisine, everybody directed us to go to this one. So one can presume, it is a well known popular joint for dosa
5
I came upon this restaurant as we were looking around Little India, at first I snatched a samosa and a vadai to scarf down as we went along but immediately vowed to return as the snacks were crisp, fresh and well seasoned. On eating there fully I had a masala dhosa, which was delicious, and two glasses of the rose milk, which was divine; my friend, who was rather fearful of the more spicy Indian dishes, allowed herself to be persuaded to have the vadai, and a big tub of plain yoghurt, which she appreciated, along with a mango lassi and some butter naan. I would certainly come back here as the food is great, prices excellent and the staff are efficient and pleasant. It has a fantastic authentic atmosphere
4
Firstly, I notice that people are mixing up the Komalas fast food outlet with Komala vilas restaurant. This page is meant for the restaurant, not the fast food outlet. Dined here many times with my wife and the food was really above par consistently. We always go there for their meals, steamed rice served with vegetarian side dishes like kootu or aviyal, poriyal, masala along with sambar, rasam, yogurt, papadam and payasam! The food tastes fresh and definitely has that home-cooked taste. The staffs are polite, service is prompt and food is very reasonably priced. Overall, Komalas serves probably the best vegetarian southindian set meals in Singapore.

I never miss visiting this South Indian restaurant when I am in Singapore. I had the Upma and Pooris and believe me, it was better than having the same at Saravana Bhavan......
4
Enjoyed early morning breakfast and Coffee . The restaurant opens at 0730 hrs and is quite early. Service & Food is great !
4
Right next to Little India market, great place to eat if you're looking for a cheap, tasty and typical Indian restaurant. Strongly recommend!
5
the meal i had here is one of the best south Indian food i have ever had...it was fresh and very tasty and economical..if you are in Singapore and want to have south Indian food make sure to visit this place.. :)

I've been eating 3 times a week at Komala Villas since '01, and for the first few years it was in their Scotts Mall food court location, and then after Scotts closed for renovations my visits shortened due to having to go to Little India which was a bit far for a lunch.Anyhow, absolutely brilliant Southern Indian food, fresh & full of that awesome spice. If you live in SG and have never tried it you are simply missing out. If you are visiting, go down to Little India and enjoy the change in scenery along with some Komala Villas....you won't regret it!My favs are the Mysore Masala Dosai, Onion Uthappam, Sambar Idly, ALL of their side dishes, and of course their Chappati! Been living in Beijing & US for a while now but visit SG 3-4 times a year and always make it a point to visit Komala Villas......fabulous food
5
Tried Rawa Mysore Masala... very tasty pure indian and quite enough for a meal... but ordered also the Vadai instead of Samossa too common! ++ specialty u shd taste...after that i was fed up!MassalaTea... transports u to ChandniChowk old delhi s chai wallahs!For info it is a FULL VG RESTOAnd the CURRIES ONLY AFTER 18'

I was hungry, having skipped breakfast at the airport - and having walked about a kilometer to get to the restaurant. So ordered the rice meal. The quantity was generous and they offer free "refills" - I had a bit of extra rice. There were five little containers to go along with the rice - I detected the classic lentil curry (sambhar), the southern soup (rasam), yogurt, a dessert and a fantastic tomato based curry I could not recognize. Sparing the dessert for last, I used all of the other add-on's and found the going very good. In addition, the plate had a crisp papadam, a vada (savory doughnut), pickles and two, maybe three cooked vegetables in various heaps. I liked that it was served on a banana leaf, in keeping with traditional style. Also consistent with tradition, they did not keep any utensils on the table - however I did notice a little plastic spoon standing out of the firm-set yogurt. While the entrance to the restaurant gave an impression of grace and elegance, inside it was much more homely and informal. Definitely more of a casual diner. You have to pay for your food before you sit down, which was a bit confusing. During the meal, I was tapped on the shoulder by an elderly server who wanted to know if I wanted any additional helpings. I liked his warm and friendly attitude. I would gladly come back and bring family over. Rice meals are not available from 4 to 5 p.m
4
There are quiet a few branches of this resto in Singapore - seen a couple of them in Singapore - guessing they are all of the same brand. Good food at a very reasonable price. The resto's are small - someitmes cramped up and good value. One of the good options in the little india area
4
This is one place i visited 3 out of my 4 nights for lunch and Dinner. Very authentic, simple, yummy & home like food. I felt like i was at my hoime when in Singapore. This is a very old restaurant, guess over 50 years old, has stood by its name and reputation. The price for 1 lunch/dinner was 8 SGD, and your are sure to be tumy full by the time you finished the meals.Highly recommended place
5
Self and wife son daughter-in-law and grand son had been to Singapore during 13th to 16th Feb 14 on Vacation. During our stay we had the pleasure of visiting Komalas for our Lunch. It was really our best meals with good ambiance. People at the reception and serving us very nice and decent.We had sumptuous meals with variety of vegetables and at last fresh drinks. One more interest thing is that there is no pricing for the meals/dishes they serve. We may pay whatever we wish and there is no compulsion.I cannot forget this hotel in my life time and the courtesy we received from the restaurant authorities.Let me pray God that let this generosity to continue for ever
5
Had an awesome night with a mate, the food was vegetarian and even though we both love our meat there food was awesome.
Highly recommend for anyone who wants good food and a good night on a budget.
5
In Singapore this is the best restaurant good quality south indian food and value for money. Must try will try again and again
5
As we are vegetarians so we loved to have south Indian and north Indian food there.The staff was friendly and took good care of our special needs.If ever I visit Singapore I will definitely have delicious Dosa variety there.
5
What a nice surprise. Great authentic South Indian food, fast service, friendly staff, and fairly cheap too. I love a lamb curry, but didn't miss meat at all here. Try it!
4
The food was really very good, fresh,vegetables crisp, taste was perfect!
Ambiance is not very special, but the food makes everything good. prices are low. We paid 14 sin dollar a person incl drinks
5
I wandered into this restaurant based on the tripadvisor reviews. It was an amazing experience. If you are like me and don't know much about Indian food or just want to get a sampler try the rice meal & briyani. Food is a little on the spicy side but then again what are you doing at an Indian restaurant if you don't like spicy food in the first place :-
5
After visiting Mumbai we taken back with how fantastic and affordable the food was and also a little saddened knowing it would be quite a while until we were back there. After visiting Little India we were so happy we came across this place. Delicious and extremely affordable and all vegetarian as well. If you are someone who only eats meat in meals I absolutely implore you to visit a vegetarian Indian restaurant and be ready to have one of the best meals you've eaten
5
Hi All,The food is good and tasty you can have south Indian style unlimited lunch for a nominal cost that too with out GST and Service charge.As this is budget hotel not to expect much regarding the interior.To have stomach full veg food should visit it :-
5
We visit Singapore relatively frequently from UK, and always go to Komalas Vilas. It's quick, simple and excellent for a light snack/ meal. Don't expect to stay more than 30 minutes, but if you're tired and jetlagged, that's perfect. We're always the only non-locals there, and we have had excellent food every time we go - we've only ever gone for the light meal menu - e.g. bread (of varying types - all brilliant) with daal or curry. My favourite is the bhattura, but the dosai are great too
5
This was my favorite meal in Singapore. Busy, low-key restaurants right in the middle of Little India. We ate upstairs and ordered a ton of different things. Our favorite was probably the dosai meal -- which comes with 5 different curries to dip your crispy dosa in. We also really liked the aloo gobi. The mango shake is quite possibly the most delicious drink ever. If you like authentic, local spots, you will love this place. All food is vegetarian too -- we're meat eaters, but it was nice to have a break. Expect to pay $10-15 USD per person depending on how much you order
5
Famous south indian restaurant .. food is great.. loved it as its pure vegetarian,, ate here everyday when I stayed in Singapore for 5 days..
4
food was great, traditional, would go back again and again. Little hard to get used to eat food with fingers but what the heck you are on vacation.
3
Nice place, we took take away to feed son for his dinner, finally we took the idly back to Sri Lanka and he had it for breakfast, really nice taste and soft. Thanks
5
Going just a little past my comfort zone I tried this South Indian restaurant and was most pleased. They do cater to westerners and the rest can be figured out by watching the locals enjoy themselves. Read: Fingers : ) Such is travel! The food here was so terrific we came back a second time. The place has been around since the 1940's (I think, don't quote me) and once you try it out you'll appreciate the longevity
5
Although the offerings here are typical of South Indian restaurants everywhere, the quality of the food is better than what I can get back home. I went in looking for something new and exciting, but instead what I found was really solid execution of South Indian favorites. The prices are great, too
5
As indian vegeterians, my family could not stand the smell of the food courts in singapore that smelled all the meat. So our options was to explore veggie joints in singapore, especially the indian vegeterians. And undoubtedly Komalas with its great chain of restaurants across singapore is the best. Komalas had different options : from its original restaurant in middle of little india to the very elite one in suntec city mall (Tower 2 : Level 3 garden restaurants place).We visited the little india one for 2 days in a row for full breakfast that can sustain for the rest of the day as we went around singapore. Its very affordable and very nice. Order the dosas as its very fresh and good here. We had an amazing weekend brunch buffet that was for $10 per adult, ask for discount for child and they may give one, this we had in suntech city mall. The weekend brunch had some amazing spread ...the tomato rice, spring rolls was the bestIf you want some snacks in the evening after your city tour rides, get to komalas for some chats/samosas and more optionsDo google Komalas for list of all the restaurants to find the one that is near to you, and you will not be disappointed
5
Came here and could not stop eating! The food was fantastic. Most meals (downstairs) came with a form of bread and 2-3 different curries/dips/sauces. Each was great and the price was some of the best value food we had in singapore. Different foods are available on each floor which was a bit odd but we adapted out order and nobody was disappointed. The staff were very smiley, polite and seemed genuinely greatful for all business. The team there don't seem to have high levels of english (not that there is any reason they should) so come with patience and don't expect changes to the menu etc... If you enjoy indian food this place is a must.some patien
4
Via Tripadvisor we got this tip.We went to have diner.The staff is very friendly and very fast.We got two plates: one with rice, pancakes and 4 kinds of dips. We also got one with two kind of dips and pancakes.During diner The staff gave us extra pancakes. This, with two drinks, cost us $ 20,- Tip: GO THERETip: If they say the food is not spicey, know it is a bit spicey!!
4
There are a few wonderful 'local' Indian restaurants along this street and this is up there with the best. Good, clean flavours. And a nice array of dishes to choose from. Its well priced and continuously full of Singapore Indians which is further proof of its worth
5
This is not a posh restaurant and the service varies, but the food is excellent and it is definitely worth trying out. You have a huge selection of dosais and rice dishes. If you want to eat bigger meals (e.g. biriyani) go upstairs, but if you are happy with the dosais (pancake like breads), then stay downstairs. Each meal comes with its own sauces to dip your breads in. My favourite - the Rawa Masala Dosai (made with semolina flour, with chilli and black pepper, and stuffed with a delicious potato curry). You could have a Rasam starter (spicy drink) or a Vadai (lentil based 'bread). Try a lassi (a yoghurt drink) and if you have a sweet tooth try one of the many sweets they have on offer. The portions are actually quite large, so order one set and then see if you have space for some more. Wash your hands before eating, use your right hand when eating if you are using your hands to eat - you may be given a spoon and fork
4
My family enjoyed the Masala Dosa and the south Indian meals here. The staff is helpful and though the place needs to maintained form cleaniness point of view, the food is tasty.
5
I can't believe I was eating in this place, unique experience. Soo Indian cuisine, all vegetarian food. Although it was without meat, the taste of the curry is fantastic, I love it. The waiter serve politely and its also cheap.
4
As a traveller we look forward to food which does not hurt out system .we found a good variety of veg food at this place plus very courteous staff who make us feel at home
5
Best place for South Indian food in Singapore. Very tasty and food is served fresh. Staff very hospitable
5
cent percent pure and authentic south indian vegtarian restgaurant in Singapore.
there is no match of the restaurant. The restaurant is establised in Singapore more than 50 years ago
5
Wanted to have a nice Indian vegetarian food and this restaurant in Little India was ultimate choice. Great taste and very courteous staff. Full meals between 7-8 sing dollars. worth the money
4
There seems to be two places with similar names in close proximity. This ones on Serangoon Road. I was lucky to be around during Diwali. The place was busy with locals, but I was quickly shown to a table. Food was simple, delicious and very good value. The dips and curries especially so. Very welcome vegetarian food which had been difficult to find on my travels in S.E. Asia. The decor and layout is basic and no frills and gives the impression of it having been busy for many a year. Would definitely return again if I visited Singapore once more
5
I was in world of heaven on this restaurant, had the dosai set meal bit weird eating with your hands but I suppose that is authentic Indian, even though in India I never ate with my hands... The lemon juice is fantastic A+ recommended would eat there all the time if I could
3
Though I have eaten in many places at Singapore, this one I have tried only recently. Good South Indian cuisine at affordable rate. We need to pay at entrance (staff Anju looked upset when she was taking our order-don't know why) and then it is self service. Bad thing is they don't even give water. Come on guys, you have so many staff to clean, depute atleast one to fetch water which is very important. Well maintained and serving hot & tasty dishes
3
We had been there for a family dinner for 10 and ended up ordering Meal Plate which had vegetables not cooked the way it tastes in the same restaurant for lunch(which is quite good), chapathi plate (again the vegetables are cooked as though meant for small kids, not too spicy or tasty)...I would rate this place Good for lunch (if you are looking for south indian meals on banana leaf) but average if you are looking for variety in dinner or even a simple meal..
3
great indian food for a very cheap price.
Taste the "Dosay masala" and "Bhattura"... both fantastic.
Is a tipical indian restaurant. The staff is friendly and helpfull to choose the plate
5
One of my favourite South Indian Restaurants and I visit every time I am in Singapore. You get excellent Madras Meals.
3
Good place to try Indian vegetarian in a fast food environment. The food is nothing to shout about. Taste and quality is what you can expect in other reputable Indian restaurant.
5
It is one of the best south indian or indian restaurant in Little India.Preferable for people who love south indian or indian food.It may be costly to indians but taste was good.
5
just loved the food - very reasonable and tasty. it was an unlimited meal and the rice was so heavenly. stayed in Singapore for the f1 and visited this place on the last day of my stay. beingt a veggie, very hard to get your palette right. the service was nice too...the butter milk was cold and tasty! very much needed for the humid and hot weather in Singapore.My other 2 days went to ananda bhavan for lunch, but this was a better choice. wish I went there earlier days as well.simple and lovely meal!
4
Had diner there last night and I loved the experience! I was seating downstairs and i'm so glad I did!! . There were only Indians having diner in the room, ( The only few foreigners I saw entering the restaurant went straight upstairs) and I really flet like i was in India!! Everyone was eating with their hands but the waiter smiled at me and brang me a fork and a spoon after he saw my reaction when I got my plate :) I got the rice plate. It comes with a selection of different dishes so if you don't know what to order it's a good option to try different things. I think it was the most expensive dish on the menue, 8$ (still a great value) Most of the other dishes are between 3 and 6$.The food is good. Of course at this price you can't expect the best but it's fresh, tasty and a very good value!!The staff was really nice and I loved the atmosphere. I'm definitely going back there soon
5
Established in 1947 - what a history.Vegetarian only - don't that stop you! When staying nearby in Little India, this is my choice for breakfast.Everything works efficiently - if you want to eat and run - it is fast. ...and it is cheap! ($5.00 for meal and marsala tea - what a great deal)If you want to linger a while, that is fine - keep trying some of the snacks.Great melting pot of different patrons. and you don't have to eat with your fingers (cutlery is available). But what the heck - bog in
4
If you want an authentic, cheap, tasty South Indian meal, this is the place to go. We went to the Race Course Road branch of this chain. The service was prompt and we received our food very quickly. We had a very filling dinner for two people for $16! Amazing food and highly recommended
5
I used to eat here regularly; read lunch each day, sometimes dinner as well. After many years, I visited it again this past month. It is just as it was and a great experience as always.I've always eaten at the Serangoon Road location (though this review says 12/14 Buffalo Road). I go upstairs and have the meal. Eat with your hands, lick your fingers clean
4
This restaurant is very close to Little India station and as well as the shopping bazaar "Musfata Centre". We used to travel from Scotts road to Little India mainly to have breakfast at Komalas. We had Dosa and Battoora. The food was tasty but a bit costly on your pocket. I would definitely recommend this to travellers from South India who would like to shop and dine in Little India. All the very best
4
This place is one of my favourite places for a lunch or dinner at Little India. The taste there has always been the best and it's on my list of must visit places for people who'd like to taste South-Indian vegetarian food.
4
I had a meal here tonight and it was fantatic. In particular the papodums and the creamy milk dessert that comes with the set were amazing. Its very cheap and decor a little tired but that only adds to the atomosphere.
4
I went to the restaurant 3weeks and had a veg thali it was just amazing the sambar, rasam and the different vegetables that camr along.Honestly real value for money.Would recommend if you like vegetarian.
4
We ordered a mix of snacks and set meals.The use of garlic in some of the dishes in the set meal was a bit off putting and they had a bit more pepper than we like. However the snacks were excellent,specially the Vada and we went back to pick some up again as a takeaway.As a value proposition the pricing is more competitive compared to MTR which is reflected in its popularity
5
The food here was great! My boyfriend and I were living quite close to Little India, and stumbled upon this place. Went there for breakfast twice and both times it was great. The place is full of locals, the service is great and very quick. This is not somewhere you would go for a special occasion, however, the food is delicious and it can easily become a regular place to visit
5
For a vegetarian meal (I'm a strict carnivore, I usually won't eat at a vegetarian restaurant by choice) but stumbled across it while in Little India and recalled reading about it on another website. Some of the most tasty and satisfying Indian we've both ever had in our lives and the fact that it was all vegetarian made me respect the meal even more given that I avoid vegetarian restaurants usually.The food, whilst very tasty and satisfying, was incredibly cheap also. From memory mains were only a few dollars a piece (somewhere around the $4 - $7 each mark). Anyway we ordered a range of meals and polished every one of them off. Unfortunately can't remember what we ordered and didn't take any pictures but we definitely enjoyed them.The restaurant itself was very basic, by no means fancy at all, but you wouldn't come here for fine dining. The restaurant didn't take regular credit cards except for NETS which I'd never seen before so am assuming it's more of the local card, so bring cash.Would definitely eat there again if we ever found ourselves in Little India
4
We were 3 families and had visited this restaurant couple of time during our stay at Singapore. The Food is served in authentic Indian / South Indian tradition. We found the food very testy. and the Prices are also very attractive. I definitely recommend this hotel
5
When visiting Singapore, visiting Little India is a must do. When visiting Little India, visiting Komala Villas restaurant is a real must. The food, is so delicious and very cheap. We as a family had a wonderful lunch and so delighted to have natural taste of real south indian vegetarian food. The quality food is excellent with wonderful varieties. I'll definitely be looking forward to having some wonderful meals at Komala Villas when visiting Singapore next time
5
From what locals tell me this is one of the oldest, most authentic South Indian restaurant in all of Singapore. Having eaten at more than a dozen restaurants in the area I at attest that the food is definitely the best South Indian food I have ever had. The menu is entirely vegetarian, try their Idaly, Pathooras and different Dosai. The coffee, masala and ginger tea is also pretty good. Although, the ambiance like an high end restaurant but then the prices are very reasonable and the amazingly delicious food dosen't really make you think much about the ambiance
5
I am not vegetarian. I always thought vegetarian food was cauliflower cheese or carrots. Well I couldn't be more wrong. The South Indian Rice meal on banana leaf for $8 is sensational. Dont ask me what it is. . But it is tasty, nutritious and fantastic value for money. Highly recommend this place...oh..make sure you go to the upstairs area
3
if you a spices lover, you should try indian food in here and their prices is good. Ask the waiter to suggest a menu for you and explain what it is, it will help much.
4
Value for the money...Good Quality & good in Taste...Nearly 10 direct outlets in Singapore and 4 franchises...All the prices are same...So no need to worry......It was established in 1947..
5
The restaurant is at the perfect place - right outside Mustaffa. Eat as much as you want and you will not hurt your pocket a great deal. The best part is the food is really great, I mean authentic Indian cuisine.
5
Good food, Fast and friendly service. We are not expert in Indian food, but the taste was simply great. Big value for what you pay.
5
I like the tiffin but not their meals. Meals did not have too many vegetables and the curries were mediocre. Breakfast items are excellent and coffee is very good too.
5
Nothing to dislike about this one - affordable food with a number of good South and North Indian options!
3
Location is good and only walking distance to the hotel where i stayed in.What I liked best was ginger tea in the restaurant was very delicious.Prices are very reasonable and the staff is very friendly.I recommend this restaurant for those of you who are vegetarians
4
I have been going to Komala Vilas since I was a kid. It is one of the oldest Indian restaurants in Singapore and has been at the same location for decades. I always bring friends visiting from overseas there and women especially seem to like the food - not sure why. Try and avoid using the restrooms in the restaurant, as you have to walk past the kitchen and this could be a bit of a shock for the uninitiated
4
When you visit Singapore as a tourist or in Business, the one thing not to miss is to get hold of a food in Komala Vilas. There are three restaurants of Komala Vilas in the vicinity of Little India; all of them have similar taste and aroma. So feel free to enter which ever you find is less crowded. These restaurants are mostly run full house during the week ends. So beware of your timings, try to time in off peak hours. The food is very tasty and the most important thing is it doesnâ€™t spoil the stomach, so you can trust it and enter and have your share of the delicious food. If you want authentic south Indian tiffin in Singapore there is no better place than Komala Vilas, it is surrely not the cheapest, but considering the exorbitant fees charged by the higher end Indian restaurants, it is much more easy on your purse. The service is good. Ambience is not bad. So enjoy the food there. Even though they serve North Indian Food, if you want authentic North Indian Try more specific North Indian Restaurant. Over all a good place to eat!!!
3
Given the high ratings on TripAdvisor, our expectations were kind of high. The place is kind of dingy and not the best ambience, but we thought that's part of the hole in the wall aspect -- but the food wasn't that impressive (except for the Chili Protta). Vada, Cone Dosa, Masala Dosa .. they were just okay, and the Pakoda was pretty dismal. We were kind of hungry when we arrived, so weren't looking for shopping around .. but later as we walked along Serangoon road, we saw much better places (ambience wise) and judging by the crowd, would have been much better place to eat (e.g. couple of really goodlooking Tandoori places, and one place called Indian Wok that server "Indian style Chinese Food" -- so, don't waste your time her
4
Great south Indian food.
Food is economically priced. Taste is good. Hygine is good. Service is fast. Overall, a great place for Indians, Westerners and Chinese to taste real south indian food!
4
Good Food at reasonable prices.
However was stunned with the use of plastics so freely.
Avoid the coffee if your truly begin ur day with cuppa kappi.
You get a good crowd esp on the weekends here
5
Basic and wonderful - best Dosas in Singapore. The rice meals are very good value and its vegetarian so somewhat healthy!
3
Did not visit Komala Villas for quite some time, the food used to be great, and business was brisk. The old main shop of Komala, upper floor used to serve rice only, lower floor used to serve tosai, naan and alike. Was quite disappointed during my recent visit. more than half of the tables were not occupied, both upper floor and lower floor served every thing.The standard of both rice and tosai had dropped, the famous tea with milk tasted almost like those served at the common coffee shops.The only compliment was the price remained low
3
This place was supposed to be highly recommended for South Indian food, although I feel that it is more hype than facts. Our visit proved that there are much better south indian restaurants in Dubai (Taste wise as well as hygeine wise). The wash basin area was really dirty and disgusting. Food quality / taste was just okay, although the tea was great. Prices are reasonable
4
Authentic South Indian vegetarian restaurant. Food very tasty, quick service and prices are very reasonable. Don't expect ambience or western standards. Paper Masala Dosa & Masala Tea is recommended. Staff is very flexible and friendly.The great thing about this restaurant is authentic south indian vegetarian food. You just need to have a quick tasty meal and leave the place as more people waiting outside to get in
4
After a long day of sightseeing and returning to our hotel in Little India we wanted to try some authentic Indian food. Asking a middle aged shop owner for an authentic restaurant serving vegetarian banana leaf meals and dosas we were referred to Komala Villas Restaurant. We were pointed upstairs, chose our meals from the menu, paid at the cashier, were seated and soon served with simple but very tasteful dishes. It's a simple and unpretentious restaurant well worth a visit for everybody seeking good vegetarian food
5
If you are looking for authentic South Indian Food in Singapore there is no better choice than Komala Vilas. There are three branches - Serangoon Road, Buffalo Road & Race Course Road run by the same management. The taste is closest to Indian food that you can get in Singapore and service is very good. The food is priced very reasonable and is affordable for one and all. The staff is very friendly and attends to all your needs. Specially some of the breakfast items served are even better than the food you might get back in India. Great place if you want to have a quick bite and not fussy about the ambience. They do not charge GST separately and there is no service charge like other restaurants in Singapore which makes the price really affordable
1
To avoid confusion , this review os about the restaurant on Buffalow Road, Singapore . There is one more place with the sand restaurant name just 500 mtrs away .If you are a average middle class family with hygine cauncious , i will stringly recoomend you to avoid this place .The service is worst , taste is absoluy nothibg to dp with South Indian taste , there is heavy rush of loclites , loud music goes on , drinking wayer is unhigenic , hand wash basine are is absolute unclean .While servibg , sambar mixes with chutney mixes with ither eatables . If by chance yiu get a chance to see the area nect to kitchen , yiou will prefer the ordered food there & there itself .Over all in this area the indian Restaurants use plasic glasses to serve chutney , sambar , curds & sweets , this restaurant is not an exception .Over all the lady at the counter denied to accept VISA / MASTER card .Over all no good value for money . Fully avoidable

Lots of great reviews and one of my party decided we should go. I'm pretty flexible with restaurants, but this is one of (I think) only 2 terrible ratings I've ever given.By western standards, this is not a great place. It is 'South Indian' and if you don't know what that means, let me summarize as vegetarian and eat with your hands. I don't mind that, but the dishes our table ordered were pretty average and didn't really stand out at all. So the quality of the food did not make up for the genuine Indian feeling of abject poverty that the place portrayed. I know I am showing my western values here, but that is the reality of this restaurant. If you know what you are expecting and you like that sort of eating style and food - then like many others, you might find this place good. I don't and did not.Mind you - it was cheap. And I mean very cheap. Personally I would have preferred to pay a bit more and have better surroundings.PS - no alcohol here either
5
Great veggie place. Eating with your hands is the order of the day but they kindly brought us some spoons. The food is fresh spicy and delicious. Good variety to choose from and helpful staff if you are unsure about anything
5
Every year we visit Singapore, and our kids LOVE going to Komala Villas on Serangoon road. It is not a upmarket resturant, but if you want to taste the most devine vegetarian food, served anywhere in the world, Komala Villas is THE PLACE!!
5
they have a good menu card. convenient location.you can have good food at reasonable rates.can have a family time.
4
This small Indian vegetarian restaurant doesn’t look like much but the food here is wonderful and the staff was very friendly and eager to help us order whatever suited our fancy. Plenty of dosa, for sure, but for a real treat, try the “cone dosa” which stands at least two feet tall and looks like an enormous dunce cap—though you’d be a dunce not to dig right in and start munching. Delicious. If you get friendly with the owner, Vijay Singe, ask to see the kitchen. A great treat
5
Did not visit restaurant but got as take out. The food was excellent. I enjoy naan and this one was very good. The dips that came with it were good as well. Got a mango lassie with it and it was nice and sweet. What was more impressive wad the professional packaging. If the food is as good as the take out in store I will have to visit soon
1
I was at little India & was shopping for hours with a friend. We decided to have a quick vegetarian meal - only thosai & Vadai with coffee. They were bad. I have had better coffee at coffee shops. Quality is not priority here! Service slow & the staff not helpful. Worse, it is just too congested. Really not my cup of tea.
2
Food preparation and quality were terrible. Nothing was good. Neither Dosa, nor any sambhar, rasam or chutney was good enough. Some people in our group went back and asked them to make Dosas crisper, which they then claimed got them better tasting Dosas. Prices were low but really could have avoided this place for other options in Little India area

I have known and been eating at Komala Vilas Restaurant for more than two decades. They serve excellent South Indian Thali, which is a complete meal in traditional style, using banana leaf as the base for the food. Several curries, vegetable, rice, papadum for two persons, plus juice costs about SING$17.00 - very good value for money. The service is very attentive. A word of caution though, the attendant will be watching closely and offering to add your rice, veggies, curries etc at no additional cost !!! It leaves one who is trying to loose weight with great temptation of over-eating. We had late lunch at around 2:30 pm and were so full till night that we could only manage to have very light dinner.
2
I went to the new joint in Race Course Road after reading a lot of reviews but was totally disappointed. It was just too oily & tasteless for me. it's about time they worked on their service as there are a number of joints in that area that serve better food
5
During my stay in Singapore, I started visiting the Komala's branch, B1-17, Tasty Food Court, Tanglin Mall (5 minutes from Orchard Street - Delfi Orchard), after I got bored of the limited vegetarian food at Regent Singapore hotel. The food is great, looked hygenic and served in authentic south indian style on a banana leaf. I almost invariably ended up eating Paper masala dosa, uttapam, pav bhaji, vada sambhar, rava dosa, chola bhatura and masala chai and mango lassi. They also customised my uttappam a bit, so thumbs up for that as well :)). I didnt really go for the Thali as I am not too fond of north indian food cooked in south indian styleAlso, The food is super cheap, even cheaper than what u can find in India. I was mostly done in 6 - 8 SGD (drink included). The food is very filling.. BTW, they also have a delivery service - 6444 0444 (though I didnt try their delivery service, as I had a Komala restaurant branch right next to my hotel !!

Komala Vilas isn't the most up-market Indian food in Singapore, but their dips are really the best. Our son loved the cone dosa, which was simply huge, and we have enjoyed the masala dosa, dosa meal, and others. Good lime juice, too! Go upstairs to avoid chaos, and have more space, especially if you have children. Don't forget to grab a vada or samosa on the way out. The sweet shop almost next door is also begging for your attentionâ€

When in Rome do as the Romans do, so when in Singapore's Little India, what other choice is there? Plenty of food establishments and we chose Komala in Serangoon Road because it was buzzing with locals (a good sign usually). Not disappointed. Vegetarian Indian dishes eaten traditional way (fingers). Three Naan, dhal and a curry (plus a juice and milkshake) came to grand total of $10. From our accommodation at Fullerton, it was a quick train ride with one interchange from Raffles Place to Dhoby Ghaut.
5
I think my title summarises it all. Komala Vilas is the best south indian vegetarian restaurant outside of south india. Agreed, Ambience is not its forte, but the food is simply delicious, plentiful and consistent. Gives you the feeling of enjoying a wedding lunch in India.Each item on the banana leaf is so tasty and delicious & makes you go there again and again. The quality & quantity are excellent and the taste has been consistently the same since 1995 when i dined there for first time. At $7 a meal, you can't ask for a better value. I'd very highly recommend anyone visiting Singapore to try this place
5
Have been going to Komala Villas for 20 years, first when I lived here and now as a visitor to Singapore. We go upstairs and have the rice meal. $7 for as much food as you can eat and the quality and service is always amazing. The dahl is my favourite, but all the little pots are heaven! One of my favourite restaurants ever
5
In Singapore, do not miss Komala vilas vegetarian restaurant, which is situated in busy shopping area, Serangoon road, better known as Little India. You can taste South Indian dishes and some North Indian dishes, all vegetarian, at reasonable price. You would feel at home there. They have also opened a fast food joint nearby at the other end of the street opp. to Ferrer park metro station, opposit to Musthafa shopping mall, where you can shop for anything including gold jeweller
5
Komala Vilas is a very old (1947) restaurant serving authentic vegetarian south indian food. The food is excellent even though the restaurant itself is maintained the way it was maybe 20 years ago. The food makes up for any other shortcomings. I have been travelling to Singapore and eating there for the last 30 years and have never been disappointed.
5
Being Indians we are not only food lovers but food is a very important part of the trip. We had not booked any reaturants for meals. We did eat at few restaurants..best pure veg being Woodlands Ganga on Belilious road and Komala Villas near Mustafa....the new one. Eating at the old one was not a great experience. But best was Ganga woodlands...which serves all the menus in one buffet....Punjabi, Chinese, South Indian ! Very friendly staff...always smiling....Komalas is no buffet...you have to order what you want...neat and clean and nice...
4
This was the authentic South Indian food we had since we left India. Tasted like Chennai restaurant at Singapore. In Little India, this place is a tourist spot too as it is a very old one. Although cleanliness at toilet require little more attention, overall we liked the food and service
2
I used to have dinner many time here because its near MRT. Service is very good. Specially that silent little girl and the owner. Without the knowledge of the owner, the other people ..... Once when i ordered Masala Dosa, the person had given me the old dosa which was already done for someother guest. He just heated it up in oven and gave it to me.. People order Masala Dosa for its crispiness, and i too order for that. Mine was so soft and too hot. How is that possible ? Second time i got a long strp of female Hair in rice..I cant take it ...I hate hairs in food, image when i pulled it from Rice, it was never ending. The quality can be improved if Owner focuses on the things. But one tip for everyone, If you want to ry real tasty Dosa, Try Mysore Masala Dosa from Karnataka, India. Tamilnadu dosa are not good
4
We have frequented this restaurant many times. Fast, courteous, service. Locals (or local expats, like us) eat here, but it's also great for tourists, especially the giant cone dosa. It's the largest cone dosa I've seen. If you want to dine on more than snacks, proceed to the upstairs area. If you're not fond of authentic (wet!) Indian bathrooms, use the restroom before your visit. If you are visiting Singapore, please please try South Indian Vegetarian food. It's very different than tandoori style North Indian and it's the cuisine of the local Singaporean Indians
4
The food quality was really very good. Service was average, as it was difficult to see your waiter, and others refused to help. The cleanliness was wanting. Especially the toilet & kitchen area.
4
Authentic Indian food and prices are very cheap.Tasty food and various options.Would highly recommend for tasting Indian Vegetarian food.Cleanliness would certainly need an improvement . We stayed in Singapore for 4 days and we ended up having food on 3 days here.Very nice restaurant
4
If you are looking for some authentic Indian food at Little India but yet you prefer the comfort of air-con, Komala Vilas is not a bad choice.I dropped by for some afternoon tea after a walk along hot crowded Serangoon Road. The hot drinks are served in unique stainless steel cups and trays which is my first time seeing in Singapore. You can pour our your hot tea into the tray so that it cools quicker, or you can do the teh tarik (pulled tea) yourself!We also had the bhattura, a giant inflated object which I'm sure tourists will love
4
The main restaurant of this small chain is largely unchanged (with the exception of air conditioning) from it's original form according to a friend who has been visiting it for decades. Head to the second floor and order the rice meal if you have an appetite. This is an all-you-can-eat platter of several different curries, coconut chutney, raita, etc. You can ask for more of anything on the plate for the low price of 7 dollars. If you are up for something lighter try a dosa. Downstairs you can only order their sweets and dosas and the atmosphere is a bit less relaxed and more cramped. Be careful going down the stairs when you leave; they are a steep and can be somewhat slick under foot
3
Good food if you love South Indian food. However no place for non veg eaters, sadly. We tried chola bhatura, puri sabji and some sweets, burfi and laddoo. This is small restaurant with cramped place. At times not very clean, good for quick and as fast food. I am meat eater so definitely don't like going to only veg restros, however sometimes I do this for my wife (we have to be considerate right). I enjoyed a bit though, definitely I took my wife to another Restro to satisfy my craving for mutton :)I am mutton guy, chicken last option. I specially come to Mustafa to eat mutton and I love it at some places, sakranti (mutton vindaloo), Indian Summer (Rogan Josh). You should try this Indian Dish sometime
5
If you've been to Little India in Singapore, then there's no way you are going to miss this place. One of the best places where you get to enjoy authentic South Indian food. The steaming idlis, dosa, chutney, vadas, Filter coffee..the list goes on. Not at all expensive and well no compromise in quantity as well. Everything here is just made fresh and served hot on your table and moreover you needn't worry about waiting for your food as the service here is fast as well. And for people who expect a 5 star hotel experience out of this place, then this might not be the place for them
4
Two of us ate ourselves silly for under S$30! The service was fast and helpful and the tastes were sensational. I really haven't had Indian food this good since I was in India. Needed to go for a long walk afterwards to walk it off a bit. Yum
5
I've been dining here since my first visit to Singapore in 1972. The upstairs vegetarian restaurant is superb and hasn't changed much. fabulous selection. I had the afternoon free with a short overnight stopover in Singapore, so I took the trains from the airport to "Little India" station off Buffalo Rd. and headed along an extremely fragrant, exotic street until hitting Serangoon Rd. and there it was. While I'm sure there are other Indian restaurants around, I have proven this one to be simply marvelous every time. The flavours are simply amazing. I once studied in Madras/Vellore and it took me right back. The staff kept looking to me smiling because they could see my enjoyment. The toilet was clean but you had to walk through a busy boisterous kitchen to get there..did I mind? One of my favorite dishes is the Bhatura with chick pea curry. The Bhatura comes very hot, still inflated like a football in the process of collapsing as it is set down before you. This has been the case most of the time. It is always worth the trouble for me to go from the airport to that restaurant and back as I travel through Singapore
5
I did my research before visiting this place. The place has retained is down to earth, gives you a feel of the retro madras style fast food joints. The owners have retained the authentic Sambar taste here. I had my brunch: Dosa + coconut chutni, Idly+vada+Sambar and Filter coffee. The food was really tasty. The prices do not pinch your pockets for the quality and quantity of food. Perfect for a shoe string budget traveler(which I was).Somehow felt that they could have paid more attention to the hygiene conditions in the loo and the wash basin
5
Before going to Singapore I came to know of this restaurant and I stayed near to this restaurant to have food in this food joint.The expirience is good although the taste of south indian foods are not that great which we get it in Kolkata but still I have praise for it.The south Indian tea was also good.The south indian thali is given in banana leaves which just awesome.Overall this is nice restauran
5
A very good Quality Andhra Style meal , A tasteful experience, returned there twice to get the a very good quality vegetarian food, served on a banana leaf, felt I was in South India
5
I had an amazing, truly Indian lunch for 8 sin dollars!
The staff is super nice, careful and alert, you can have all the seconds you ask
3
The floor area is small. You may have to wait for a while to get a table. The food is served within ten to fifteen minutes after the order is taken.
4
Freshly prepared and value for money. Authentic taste and good portions. Though not a big menu, what is offered is of great quality. Would go there over and over again.
5
Vegetarian restaurant,you find all types or indian food served different type or naan. Recommended tor a quick lunch pit stop while visiting little india
4
This place is so popular that we had to wait to get in. We were heavily outnumbered by locals who think this veggie restaurant is worth visiting - and so did we. We met the entire cast of a play put on as part of the Deepavali celebrations - all locals - which we had just seen. The prices are cheap, and it is not a romantic experience - you share tables as with many of the local restaurants, and you can eat with your fingers, although we were given spoons and forks, but if you want local colour and food and experience, then come here
3
I am a Malaysian Indian and make frequent visits to Singapore to visit friends and relativels. During my last visit to Singapore on 31st August, 2012 I stayed in Victoria Hotel as the Hotel was just opposite the National Library where the Philatelic Exhibition was held. For me, I take any food - Western, Chinese or Malay food. But I prefer to take South Indian food as I am used to that kind of food in my hometown. There are many good Restaurents in and around Serangoon Road to choose
3
The food was okay , the atmosphere noisy. The service was good. There was a lot of choice for main courses, side dishes, and desserts. The prices were reasonable. For south Indian food, I personally prefer Murugan's on Syed Alwi Road - better food and better service
4
This is one place I have been waiting since hearing about this place since ages. Always have been hearing of the Sambar Rice and Curd rice which I duly ordered. Sambar rice was just yummy with the aroma of ghee pervading all across. And the curd rice was very tasty with the spicy lemon pickle. A couple of papads were given too. All this at a price of a little less than 6SGD. Have also tasted the same at their Deli at Boon Lay, and the taste is just the same.Seating was a bit tiugh and had to roam around the place with my plate to get hold of a seat. Most of the tables are 8 seaters and I was trying hard not to trouble families
4
Go there for a nice vegetarian food option. We tried both a south indian thali and north Indian daal + naan. Taste was good and authentic. ambience and presentation is very basic though, but if you are looking for a economical option (a full meal with drinks and desert @S$10), do go there.Its quite easily approachable through MRT as its just 100m from Little India station
4
Try the curry-dish head if tat's one dish one wants to try. Masala-chicken is also delicious.
Nearest MRT Station will be Little India.
4
It was a nice experience to have some good south Indian food at this hotel. The hotel being at a reasonable rate is always crowded. Tasty and Value for money.
4
As is seems there are more Komala villa restaurants, we ate at the place on serangoon road. Perfect, delicious food. Cheap, good service. Real indian food. Hardly a tourist there only packed with local indians, so this should say enough.
4
This is a great place for South Indian food. It is self-service so you need to place your order and get drinking water for your table, if you need it. Food is good and the portions are satisfying. Good value for money.
5
Not been here for many years, but as good as ever. South Indian vegetrian food all catered for. Menu has little changed but they have added some newer items for kids. And cheap as chips!
3
We had taken our dinner at the Komala Villas restaurant. The restaurant is located in the little India area. they serves the south Indian dishes and the combos of the south Indian dishes. We have ordered the combos but the food taste was not that kind of great and the main thing was that the food especially the combos getting colder in some times so that its not good to eat. For me its ok kind of food they serves but the plus point was that its veg restaurant in Singapore and quick service
5
Any person who goes to Singapore has to visit this place. One of the oldest joints, I have vague memories of this place, when I first visited in 1980's. The place is still the same, serving excellent vegetarian food. We had south indian meals and filter coffee
4
I ate upstairs; I was the only foreigner there. It's quite full, and I shared a table with another customer. Food was good, cutlery is not provided so beware if you're not comfortable about digging into a rice dish with your hands! I had a thali, and it was far too much food for me to finish. Not a place to sit and linger over a long lunch
4
Situated in Little India a restaurant serving Indian Vegetarian food. really impressed with the speed to service. A lot of meal options and combos available for the hungry traveller. They can take care of keep the place a little more clean during peak timings. on a few ocassion it took nearly 10 mintues to place the order itsel
5
I've been coming to this restaurant for many years but I only as part of a stopover in Singapore. Komala Vilas is renowned the world over amongst traveling South Indians as THE place to eat when you only have a short stay. The food was delicious (as it has always been) the ginger tea was especially good and the service and value without fault. Watch out for the tea cups if you do order one - they are very hot! That little bowl that they come with is for you to pour a bit of tea into to cool it down before drinking :) my personal recommendation is the puree set! Enjoy
3
Last time, the food is tasty and nice to eat. Now its just average.
5
This is a great, very casual restaurant with good food. Not exactly like home cooking but very enjoyable. Portions can be big and filling. I never learn and always order too much.
4
Taste like home made food and not very spicy for Indian food... better to have this than tandoori food as its low in Masala and Fat... you can also try their South Indian Filter coffee, South Indian food which is of good value and quality
4
Went upstairs for the extra seating, had the mushroom something and a paneer, three roti's all excellent. $35 to feed three of us lads. You can eat with your right hand like the locals if you want, but spoon and fork are provided.
5
This vegetarian restaurant feels truly Indian - we were the only tourists around. The staff were very friendly. We had a massive collection of dishes each - the vegetable biriyani dish - for only about 6S$, which is great value. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is even a remote fan of Indian food
1
My coupon given by travel agent had this name too. Had very good experience with Komala in Raffles place earlier when i had come for a business trip. There are quite few Komala in this place and unaware of this I entered into one Komala, person in counter told me to go to some other one nearby. (only by sign language). When I entered in to other one receptionist tol me to go to another one in my list called 'Tandoor' which is surprisingly not a komala one!!! Finally I found the exact one near to Mustafa. Ordinary one like some of the Darshini's in Bangalore, but food is not good and crowd make it hell
4
Very cheap, basic, and unpretentious vegetarian food in the heart of Little India. Tasty thalis at, what for Singapore, are ridiculously cheap prices. We had three substantial thalis and three cokes for 26 Singapore dollars. At the weekend the restaurant is extremely crowded. We were asked to share our table with, what turned out to be, a very friendly Indian engineer working in the oil and gas industry. Great for a cheap, authentic tasty Indian meal
3
The place was fully packed. We arrived early and was able to get seating. We tried what looked familiar (in the menu) and kept standing up to order additional nan or curry or other indian staples. Food was good. Ambience was a typical local restaurant where food is the only reason you go there. Worth a try
5
I can honestly say that the food at Komala Villas was be best indian food I've had outside of India. The restaurant isn't exactly cozy, but the staff was professional and service was quick. We had two different kinds of combination platters and although servings were huge, not a grain of rice was left when we were done
5
We decided to be adventuresome and sought out this restaurant in the middle of Little India in Singapore for lunch (recommended by the New York Times). It was so much fun - the wait staff helped us choose vegetarian options and the food was served on a large bananna leaf - incredible fun and absolutely delicious!
2
Amongst the worst dosas I have had. Avoid this place unless you are very very hungry
4
Not fancy (that is an understatement), not expensive (cheap), but excellent food. No tourists, just locals enjoying spicy Southern Indian cuisine.
4
Very good food. Went there several times and always hah a great time. Really nice place.
4
The Thali has a lovely spread and great price. Consistent quality gets a high five!
4
very good place to have an authentic south indian breakfast. Good service and genuinely local
1
I think this people do not need customers and they behave rudely on counters.They have a problem with the language or tourist I do not know.I was asking him about the sitting arrangement of the resturant and this people replying me we do not have system,but still they never told me that there is self service and coupons system.I visited komala's before 20 years and so very good expererience so i wanted to repeat the same but very bad behaviour
5
I brought a French friend out to lunch. Neither he nor I knew what to order. The set lunches were easy to pick out with the help of friendly receptionist. She was eager to seat us, feed you and free up the table for the next customers. I couldn't blame her. Between the two of us, we ate like kings and spent only $12.00.We were seated upstairs. I'm a carnivore and Komala Villas Restaurant is a vegetarian restaurant but I didn't miss the lack of mea
5
My friends and I visit Komala Vilas to eat the South Indian meals - unlimited, $7, served for both lunch and dinner. They make a wholesome South Indian meal and their service of the meal is unequalled. We have been visiting Komala Vilas for sixteen years now. This meal comes with rice, a number of yogurt and tamarind based broths and portions of a number of different vegetable preparations. You do get to taste a whole range of preparations, which are also prepared quite tastily and healthily. The vegetable preparations change every day and therefore the meal does not become monotonous. The service of the meal also aims to ensure that the customer is completely satisfied with the meal. Since it is an unlimited meal, you could keep getting repeats of all items on the plate and the service is fairly informal. There are a few other South Indian restaurants that serve similar meals in Singapore at comparable prices, but none of them rivals the meal at Komala Vilas. All the branches of Komala VIlas (in Buffalo Road and Race course road) are equally good at this preparation. There are not many Indian restaurants (even in India) that can provide as much value as Komala Vilas does
5
The Thali (Banana Leaf Curry ) served at Komala Villas is just as good now as it was in 1978 when I first ate here and little India is still authentic! Tried both the Buffalo Street branch and the original upstairs in Serrangoon Rd. - Both Rock ...bring at least Five Singapore Dollars and whatever you do ......don't visit the sweet shop at the Serrangoon location 
5
Komala Vilas on Serangoon RoadThis place attracts people from all over. It is busy and you can end up sharing a table with a local, an expat or and international visitor. Very diverse.Food is vegetarian South Indian style - if you are unsure what to eat ask the manager, he is helpful and explains well.I went there a number of times on this trip, and managed to get directed to a number of different variations
5
We all were staying here for 3 days and all of us preferred to eat here only after one average kind of dine at other restaurant Anand Bhaban.Very quick service and the best south indian hotel for all Indians.
4
This hotel on Serangoon road serves very good dosa, idli , vada etc., Appam is excellent here. Typical South Indian taste in a foreign country. Cost comes to within SGD 7 per head.
5
Fantastic value for money. Very good south indian snacks. Try idli , dosa aka thosai, vada, upma. Ghee pongal for breakfast. Of course filter coffee and you are transported to india.
5
high quality you can trust.nice vegetarian food and very reasonable prices. its an adventure eating here.
3
Filling and delicious vegetarian indian fast food. Definitely value for money - a set meal and be eat by 2 person.
3
Komala Villas is probably one of the oldest vegetarian restaurants along Serangoon Road. It, and it's menu may be a bit dated, but you know what you will get and it's reliable.
3
Just like any Mamak shop you can find at a neighbourhood coffee shop.
5
Best South Indian food in Singapore, very traditional and pure. Dont expect High Standards
5
Amazing Indian in a no frills restaurant with a no frills price tag! I will happily forego fine dining to visit this amazing eatery. Chappati plate is to die for and samosas are the best I have ever eaten! If you want linen napkins and tablecloths don't come. Of you're after great food at an unbelievably affordable price then this is for you!
2
please don't misguide people .after reading tripadvisor reviews i had been there .it was opposite to my hotel peninsula in peninsula plaza in basement.place is very dingy,,got a very bad gastroenteritis after eating there.would advice against it as there are better indian hotels right next to it there is MASALA ART a fine dining indian restaurant which is the authentic n very good
4
as other reviews have said, komala vilas is a no frills restaurant that serves great indian food. the dosas are fresh and the variety of food is as flavorful as it is colorful.
5
no frills place with authentic food at reasonable prices. they have maintained the taste all these years keep it up
5
I have tried all most all hotel of Singapore for Indian hotels but its the No1.Some of the staffs are proudy but food is good.
4
Komala Vilas is an icon among Singapore's vegetarian restaurants and still provides excellent value for money. Their filter coffee is the best in town, vadas and idlis so-so, but dosas and puriis excellent.
4
This is a vegetarian restaurant. I arrived around 10:30 for a brunch and the place was buzzing. I was the only white face in the place but didn't feel unwelcome. I discovered that some items aren't available until certain hours. The meal didn't take long to arrive and was tasty
4
I was staying in a Hotel in little India,closely located to this Restaurants.During my brief stay in Singapore,I visited this restaurants almost on all days to have snacks.They serve authentic Indian vegetarian snacks like Dosa,iddli,Vada,Uthapam et al.Really these snacks excites the Indian palate.The prices are in fact very affordable.I intend to drop in at this food joint when I visit Singapore next
5
Vegetable Masala Biryani $11.45 Singapore. My hesitance was apparent, so my food was delivered on a metal tray, with a spoon. Nearby people comfortable with the environment ate from banana leaves, with their right hand. I found the entire process and food excellent. The servers were nice, the food was good, the Mango Lassi was great. I even ordered "Butter Milk" which is very different than USA butter milk, but I really liked the flavors. This is some of the best food I've had in Singapore
4
Very good food. amazing south Indian and North Indian food. I had my dinner for 4 consecutive days here and I realy liked the north Indian curries. So if you are looking for good Indian food this is the place to go in Little India at a reasonable price
5
We took almost all lunch,dinner,breakfast here as no other hotels satisfied us,Some of the staff are not good here but food quality is very good.You can try any south Indian food here.And try to sit on it first floor as it very clean compare to ground floor.Its in Little India,while entering to little India you will see in right side after 10 to 12 shop
3
Apart from vegetarian food, tourists and others from India head to this hoary institution for good south Indian food! Tourists too make a beeline to this restaurant as ithas been widely written about and discussed in the media. Ambience is definitely not the forte of this place. The walls are garishly painted and as happens in most south Indian restaurants and generally there is loud Tamil movie music playing in the background! Service is not necessarily quick or helpful. You head to this restaurant for their authentc tasting south Indian fare! The menu is written on the walls or the waiters can reel off the items on the menu of the day. Food arrives not too soon but the taste food is what ultimately leaves most patrons happy and returning again! Themenu is limited and basic but has most south Indian snacks. Chapathis and pooris are served too. There are some items made of ragi. The restaurant also has a sweet store sellinga range of south Indian sweets. The toilet at the back of the restaurant is not maintained very well, though the restaurant claims to b rated clean by the local government. All in all, a place to head for a quick south Indian meal. The restaurant is not very big and can be easily missed in between the stores that surround it
4
Its great authentic south Indian flavour..must try if you want to try the South Indian Cuisine..and their Masala Chai (Tea) is very great..But very limited choice of North Indian cuisine. Mango Lassi is also good to try.
4
Love the South Indian breakfast available here. We got picnic lunches packed here.
4
amazingly cheap yet tasty south indian food, one of its kind in singapore. must try once......
5
This is as authentic as it gets....
Best South Indian vegetarian food around... Their prices are pretty decent as well. The ambiance is probably not the best around, but the food is truly delish... as Rachel Ray would put it....
5
Komala's restaurant in Singapore is the best Indan hotel and the food is just sumptous and feels very homely.
2
S. Indian fast food. oOmpetent.
4
We had a great time at the Komala Villas, the variety of vegetarian dishes was simply marvellous. I specially liked the Yoghurt vadas, very appetizing and the ladus with hot Indian style coffee was agreat way to finish the meal. The restaurant was simple in style and service was overall efficient and quick. As it was lunch time that we were there the place was crowded. We enjoyed the lunch visit very much
3
This is one of the oldest Indian Vegetarian Restaurants in Singapore and the history start from 1947 ... and still standing strong ...Personally, I like to go to Komala Vila for a different dining experience in a more than 60 years old eatery. To feel the BUZZ of the Indian Vegetarian eatery and the UNIQUE VIBE! And to get some of the Indian sweets and savouries (from Komala) which is just besides the eatery
4
This is one of the fewest places where i have been able to eat the most authentic South Indian food. The Dosas, Idlis wadas etc etc each and every thing is good here. This is a must visit for each and every Indian travelling to Singapor
5
This ranks as one of the better Indian vegetarian restaurants in Singapore, food-wise. I also like the table service, a rarity in smaller places in SIngapore. Don't expect too much in terms of the conventional definition of "service"- you'd be hard pressed to see your waiter crack a smile, for example- but it is quick and responsive. The food is unmatched in Singapore (and pretty much anywhere in India, I'll bet) and it is ultimate VFM. Even a simple idli can leave you completely satisfied. Don't miss the filter coffee
3
Not really fantastic
4
best veg food ever, beats all others without question. my new fav
4
"cheap and good"
4
quick and easy. plus tastes nice.
5
Love their masala thosai and poori.
2
not for the discerning of indian cuisine. find basic indian vegetarian staples served fast food style. can be a little clinical. you will not be hungry after you are done. for the budget conscious.
1
Sorry, I'm not a fan of this place despite rave reviews from my friends who are vegan.
5
used to go when I was very young
1
Very fast food type. Too commercial
5
Cheap and GOOD!
