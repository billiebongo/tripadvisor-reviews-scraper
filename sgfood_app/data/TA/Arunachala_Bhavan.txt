We came in a large group for lunch. This is one of most delicious Indian food we had. Must try their naans, masala butter chicken and mango lassi. It’s so delicious. One little comment - the name of resturant is hard to pronounce, harder to remember, also impossible to spell for a non-Indian. How to recommend to friends, especially non-Indian friends?! I have to tell people to go to “40 Race Course Road” for some amazing Indian food

Folks, if you want to try some truly great authentic Indian cuisine that’ll awaken your senses and rejuvenate your palate, look no further than Arunachala Bhavan. Their food is one of the best in Singapore at a reasonable price. It cannot get better than this. Period

Stumbled across this little place when leaving Little India. The food was absolutely delicious. The owner offered a taste of the briyani to my daughter to see if the spice level was ok. We were even able to order a dish that wasn’t on the menu as the chef offered to cook it for us. Service and food were fantastic.

As a south indian, I have to say this is the best authentic south indian restaurant in serangoon. Skip the queue for overated touristy restaurants like Apollo banana leaf, gayathris, muthus and visit this restaurant for a truly good experience.I chanced upon this relatively new restaurant due to recommendation for prawn briyani. Boy was I blown away. The Bru/Filter coffee is amazing too. Lime soda, try it. Tastes like those served in Chennai restaurants.Over the months they have added new items to their menu. Their fish curry is so authentic that you should not miss it. If you are fan of chicken gizzards, mutton intenstines (yeah they taste damn good), try them too. Mutton ribs masala is so good that you can eat the gravy by it’s own! I suppose they give top priority to service (fyi, not all indian restaurants in serangoon are service oriented) as they give you the best and explain in detail (I have seen them doing it to tourists) the food items, spiciness, recommendations etc).The prices are slightly higher than a normal chettinad restaurant, but definitely much lower than the overated ones. Visit them and trust me you will be hooked

This restaurant in under rated, I am their regular customer and I love their food. The serve food like it is cooked from home. Warm and friendly waiters, very observant and knows their menu very well and makes excellent suggestion of what to eat. Their rasam pepper mutton, fried fish and lime juice is a MUST TRY

Billing : Bill is fine if you get indian food in singapore after 3 dyas

Dropped in for a quick snack but ended up having roti and dosai with Dahl, chicken curry and fish curry washed down with lime juice.The service was really quick with the manager keen to assist with sorting out out order. The delivery was equally as quick served on traditional banana leaves.However the best bit is the really delicious food - the curries are deeply flavoured and traditional. The roti and dosai were both fantastic. The lime juice was also delicious.If you want quality tradional Indian this is a MUST.All for less than that $25 Sing - a serious value for money bargin
