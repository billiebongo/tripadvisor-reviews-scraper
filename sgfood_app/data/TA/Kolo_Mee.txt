Great flavored noodles here but a little pricey. I had previously also bad the curry chicken rice which is red in colour due to the spices. Not for people with a weak stomach but great if you love chilli

Love the firmness of the noodles, the fragrance of the soup and the generous quantity of bbq pork slices, small and delicious dumplings ...very friendly service. With a Coke, will cost you 10 Sing, maybe expensive compare to other places, but here you have air conditioning, friendly service, and immaculate eating environment

I ate at the Marine Square outlet of the restaurant. The cheapest item on the menu was the Jia Xiang kolo mee (dry version), which is supposed to be the well-known Kuching kolo mee. At $6.90 a bowl, it is like an up-sized McDonald item. The added cost came in the form of a small bowl of soup with 2 prawns and 3 wantan, which one does not get in Sarawak. The oil used in the kolo mee is fragrant enough, with char siew and minced meat.. Having brought up eating kolo mee in Kuching, the best kolo mee that I have found in Singapore can be had from a small stall inside a coffee shop located behind the Bedok library; ione bowl in generous portion costs $4. While there, you should also try the Sarawak laksa, which is very authentic, at $4.50 (I think)
