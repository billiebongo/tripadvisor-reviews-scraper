This restaurant or rather, stall has been here for the longest time, at least 30 years I believed.
It served one of the best Cantonese classic dish, the soy chicken. Always crowded in the afternoon during the weekdays.

Stumbled across this little Gem in China town. had the Soy chicken with noodles and dumplings . Full of locals which shows how good the food is. 2 dishes cost Â£3.50. lovely grub and pleasant staff.
No fancy advertisements just original good food.

Love going this place when I have craving for good Soy Sauce Chicken. The place is old school and one place you can shout your orders.

There are two shops selling soya sauce chicken along the street. Apparently this is the original one started by the founder. The chicken was tender and the noodles springy. The plus point is, the place is air-conditioned.

It's rare to find a great Cantonese soy sauce braised chicken but this it! Almost as succulent as poached chicken but drenched in a sweet sauce heady with aromatic spices.

Monday after the Race I was taken to China town by one of the local Marshals from the race for lunch. This place is recommended for its Soy sauce Chicken and believe me it was well worth it. Only a small shop in a side street but not to hard to find give it a try

Loved their noodles & rice here but I tried the hor-fun. It was as amazingly delicious, and I like that their sauce is more savoury than sweet. Chicken was soft and tender, and hor fun was springy. The Lime juice, at $2 per cup, is not worth it though. Order canned drinks or just skip the drink

One of the best Soya chicken in SG. really old family run place. usually sold out by 4pm latest. As like most commenters said it, THE BEST PART "NO LONG QUEUE" usually I get the whole chicken to share back home. one of the place that still serve juicy chicken breast, in fact it is one of the best part for of their chicken
