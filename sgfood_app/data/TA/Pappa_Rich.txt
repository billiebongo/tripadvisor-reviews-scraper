This is a very confortsble quick service resturant for some local eats. We enjoyed the classic char kuey tiao (Fried black noodles that is slightly sweeten with our local thick black soups sauce) and nasi lemak with crispy fried chicken. The food is delicious!

Food is just average nothing fantastic. Menu has wide range of Malaysian food. Service was poor,think they are under staffed

Pappa Rich offers very tasty Malaysian cuisine. The restaurant in the mall was quite busy, but we got a table immediately. Enjoed the place and the food a lot.

Good food, good service. The sambas was amazing and spicy enough! The whole plate screams cohesiveness

The food here is below average. The price they charged are not in line with the quality of the food. Not recommended.

Ambient Ok, food nothing fantastic. Service average. Prices are on the high side base on this kind of standard.

I tried the Penang char kway teow (fried white noodles) and it was delicious. There was enough wok hei (charred taste) in the dish and the ingredients were plentiful. Only complain was the cockles were overcooked and rubbery but that's probably how customers wanted them nowadays- safe without any trace of bacteria. Perhaps I'll ask Pappa Rich to leave them out next time. There were many other Malaysian local dishes and they looked delicious as well.

Mango shake was delicious, Pappas Rich because the main dishes are higher priced than other similar restaurants. Service was good and quick. Quirky ordering system, you fill out a form with your order number and quantity and pass to a passing member of staff, as it's a code number from a picture menu it's very easy and nothing gets lost in translation.We don't know if the food was not so spicy due to them serving Europeans but we love spicier food

Went to the outlet at One Km. Food also as authentic as the food in KL. I had the dry curry noodles and chicken. The curry sauce was tasty. The downside was the green cendol noodles which felt like it was still frozen and a bit too sweet
