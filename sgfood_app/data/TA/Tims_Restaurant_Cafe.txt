Though a bit cramped, the restaurant delivers on the food and presentation. Steaks, fillets, fish and chips and even vegetarian dishes. Service is personalized with amiable waiters and a manager who personally updates you if your food will be a bit late.

Four of us already had a meal elsewhere and decided to order 2 Wagyu steak medium done to share. Good service by helping us to share the tender steak.
Healthy free flow of water too.

When I went to Tim's Restaurant today,I thought the food looked appetizing. Unfortunately,it wasn't as good as it looked. The fish and chips was bad.there was too much batter on the fish,so much that you could not taste the fish.Even thinking about the fish and chips now is making me lose my appetite.the sirloin steak was okay for the price.The butter cheesecake was too dry.now to the pros.the ice cream was delicious and the serving was big .It went well with the butter cheesecake.the price was attractive.when I come again , I will try the Nepali food

We had individual meals and a bottle of red to go with. This is our frequent dinner outing location as it is a walking distance from our home. A great idea to offer western style dinner concept with a fusion touch. Good string and ambience though a little cramped up as most tables are taken up during the weekends. Food is reasonably good with a wide variety of choices.

Had grilled chicken lunch set which comes with drinks, bread, soup, main and dessert all for $13.80.The food is average but great for the price. Chicken needs a little more seasoning but the sauce and vegetables were okay. The chocolate cake for dessert was really light. Overall service was fast and good

The restaurant was located under a rather old block of HDB flats, and offered western and Nepal cuisine. For lunch, it also offered set lunch which consisted of a choice of main, garlic bread, soup of the day, day dessert & coffee, tea or milo.One could also topup $4.50 with any main course to make it a set meal, with garlic bread, soup of the day, day dessert & coffee, tea or milo.Nepali Lamb Choila ($15.80+)Boneless spring lamb leg grilled to perfection, marinated with pounded chilli, garlic, ginger, and Nepali spices served with pulau rice and radish acharThe soup of the day was cream of mushroom, served with a old school type of garlic toast.The lamb was quite tender without any gamey taste, marinated with spices which reminded me of Indian cuisine. The rice was soft, fluffy, garlicky with pieces of cashew nuts in it.The dessert was a slice of chocolate chip cake which was light fluffy.Finished off with a cup of hot milo

Came here at 8pm on a Saturday evening for dinner in the heartlands with businesses winding down for the day.Restaurant is well ventilated and lit, with still quite a few diners around. Wait staff was very friendly and warm, everyone welcomed us and assigned us a seat quickly.We ordered the Nepali Roast Chicken set with chicken based soup and garlic bread, vegetarian samosa and grilled chicken. Also we had coffee and durian puff.Food was freshly cooked and yummy. Spices similar to Indian cuisine. Would introduce friends and family here for the cozy and homely feel

Been to this restaurant 2 times for dinner with friend. They offer quite good selections of food in the menu. The food was alright and fresh with affordable price. It will get a little cramp during peak hours as the space is quite compact. Its a good choice of place to dine if you crave for western food

Visited with my friends and family. The owner and waiters are polite and attentive. Always welcome us with a cheerful smile. The shop puts in effort to prepare seasonal menu in addition to its regular menu. For such delicious western and nepalese food, it is really affordable. It's a gem at the heartlands

The food is very good, the portions huge (American size) and prices reasonable. They have daily set lunches that are super value for money. You get a soup (soup of the day), garlic bread, main course of your choice, cake and a hot drink (coffee, tea or Milo). Each dish is cooked fresh as per your order, so the taste is very good. However, it also means you have to wait for your main dish to come. So, if you only have an hour for lunch, I suggest you go somewhere else. Come back when you have more time to spare.My friends ordered grilled chicken chop with black pepper sauce. The chicken was delicious but not enough sauce. When they asked for more sauce, the waitress said it will cost an additional $1 for the extra sauce. Apparently, you have to ask for more sauce when you place the order, so that you won't be charged extra.The butter cake is excellent! Reminds me of the butter cake of my childhood - rich, buttery and not too sweet! They do sell whole cakes at reasonable prices.If you have a smaller appetite, I suggest you share 1 set meal. The price is really worth it

We tried the Western dishes, but did not venture on the Nepalese ones. The food was simple, tasty and quite easy on the wallet. Best of all, the restaurant is in Toa Payoh and near my home. üëçüèº

Been here for so may times with my friends and family and they never disappoint me. Their food are really amazing. Mo:Mos are mouth watering.
Those who love Nepalese food and Mo:Mos must visit Tims.

Amazing value for a sumptuous western or Nepalese meal. We tried the Momo and it turned out to be Nepalese "siow long pau" which was nice when hot. Their portions are larger than normal and pretty delicious too! Will be back there soon!

Cosy neighbourhood restaurant that serves interesting Nepalese cuisine if you would like to give it a try. They also serve western food at reasonable prices with set meals available as well as homemade desserts.

If you are ever in Singapore and want to eat great food - go to Tims Restaurant and Cafe in Toa Payoh - Block 95 Lorong 4 Phone 6250 5246.The stule is a combination of Seafood / Steak and interestingly Nepalese food - whilst I had the Large (and it was) Fish and my wife had the Ox Tail Stew - we both enjoyed it. Nepalese food is hale and hearty food . give it a g

We visited this restaurant with friends and were a bit disappointed. The staff were friendly but the food was very average. The chicken burger and chips was terrible. The Lassa chicken was reasonable and the ribs were quite good. The prices were reasonable but they probably need to choose one cuisine and perfect it rather than doing a bit of everything and not doing anything particularly well. I would not go back to this restaurant.

Not only does Tim's Restaurant and Cafe have the most service minded staff or waiters in Singapore, but also the most delicious chicken! I've come back to this place several times to enjoy the chicken tash, a Nepalese treasure if you ask me. (I‚Äôm not the right person to judge whether it's authentic though.) Its mix of spicy flavours explode in my mouth and make up a true party for my taste buds. The quality and the amount of meat is also a positive surprise compared to many other restaurants in town. The accompanying vegetables are both sweet and a tiny bit sour all at once, and complement the spicy chicken very well. Top this with the coconut and cinnamon flavoured rice and I‚Äôll promise you this dish will make you leave both full and happy after visiting Tim‚Äôs Restaurant and Cafe. My favourite restaurant in Singapore so far

Tim offers unique Nepalese food i the middle of Toa Payoh heartlands. During my last visit, I ordered a grilled fish which was good, grilled to the right level. My friend ordered a well done steak, but it came medium. Upon calling the waiter, he immediately got it changed and was very apologetic about it. Good service!

Tims restaurant is just a 5 min walk from braddell mrt towards the side of global yellow pages building. They serve Nepalaese and Western cuisine. The atmosphere is very good. Is is a non-ac restaurant. We had set meal at $10.80, which comes with a very thick and large volume tomato soup, garlic bread, main course (fried or grilled chicken,fish with chips), cake and tea/milo/coffee. They will give you time to eat one course before they give another. it is very good for team lunch or party. The authentic nepalese food is slightly costly. Around $11 without a set. It is a must visit restaurant for its value for money. Very friendly and courteous staff too

I visited this restaurant for dinner. This restaurant quite cozy, many customer visiting this restaurant but at the time I visit this restaurant, no queue required. The food is delicious and I love it. I spent about 40 dollar in total and planning to come back to try their lunch menu...

Was at the restaurant last sunday.
Was entertained by a particular lady server who was quite rude when we requested for a table of our choice.
This spoilt our otherwise happy occassion.
Food was of a reasonable price, quality and quantity.

Very busy at lunch time but quick service and good food. A lot of the local community are eating here which has to be a sign

Enjoyed ourselves. Food was good, with wide variety to choose from. Staff was friendly and provided good service.

Had the set lunch and ordered ribeye , and the steak is done medium well as requested. Self service ice water is good, the set comes with soup and garlic bread as well as dessert and coffee or tea. Quality is reasonably good for the price that I am paying. Probably worth repeat visits in future

This self contained cafe , located near Braddell MRT station, has plenty of seating for the lunch crowd. Service is prompt, menu varied with indoor and al-fresco seating. I had the Nepalese Chicken set meal ( about SGD$25 ) which comes with rice, vegetables, cake and coffee. The meal takes a while to be ready, vegetables are served lukewarm and chicken rather bland with no character aroma of Nepalese spice.A fish burger costs SGD$6.80 without drinks. It is 'hdb heartland style' with plenty of mayonaise on burger buns. My daughter felt that it was nothing to shout about.If I should revisit, it will be because it is cheap, parking plentiful and service cheerful. It is also near the MRT station.Will I visit again? Maybe, but to try out the steak which seems popular with the lunch crowd. But I will not make a special trip to Tim's anytime soon

My best mate, who is a vegetarian, took me to Tims. He mentioned that the steak & meat dishes were excellent at Tims. I was pessimistic at first because the review was given by a vegetarian. Then, I was introduced to Tom (the owner) & he recommended the pork ribs with pepper sauce. He didn't disappoint me at all. The pork ribs were excellent. I didn't finish there, i ordered a second dish, Nepalese mutton tesh. Again, it was excellent. My advice is, leave your expectations at the door of the restaurant as you enter. The dishes exceed all your expectations. Guaranteed! Also....Tom is a great host! He always welcomes you with a smile

I've been meaning to write this review for the longest time actually.Tim's is located in the heartland of Toa Payoh in Singapore. Access is easy by MRT (Braddell Station). Address is Block 95 of Lorong 4 Toa Payoh (located in a row of shophouses just two minutes' walk away fm the famous Nam Kee Chicken Rice Restaurant). I'm specifying the location because it's worth checking out and once you've eaten here, you'll want to return again and again!My family and I "accidentally" discovered Tim's a few years ago and have been bringing friends and family members here since for many reasons.Atmosphere is comfortable and unpretentious. Very clean and smacks of an unpretentious and yet cozy ambience.Most importantly, the food. Very reasonably priced. You get a good portion of baked fish with vegetables or fish and chips for just S$7. Add S$3.50 for soup, dessert and coffee. Specialty of lamb shank, steaks and other meat and and seafood mains are also very well-prepared and reasonably priced.Staff are efficient. The very friendly owner, Tom, personally oversees and ensures that customers are all well taken care of.Highly recommended, whether for an informal meal or special occasion. Reservation recommended especially during dinner on weekends

The food selection is varied and in some cases, unique. All are deliciously prepared. Prices are reasonable and the service is great.The "must try" specialties include lamb shank, beef stroganoff and sea bass. The proprietor, Tom, is very polite and attentive. Overall, the service is very good.This review is submitted for and on behalf of Mr. Emile Goh
