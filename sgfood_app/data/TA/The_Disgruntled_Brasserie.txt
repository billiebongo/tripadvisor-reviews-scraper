The Disgruntled Brasserie bucks the trend of many bland European bistros in Singapore with it's great food and an interesting but economical wine list. I've been a few times and went again last week for the Singapore Gourmet Flavours set dinner which was very delicious - photos attached and a highlight was the tuna tartare, served taco style on chocolate soil

Had dinner here a couple of nights ago with my wife and we both enjoyed the occasion. The presentation and content of the meal was wonderful. The service was also excellent and can not be faulted. The only downside was the price of the food and wine when you are used to Australian prices. Cheapest bottle of red wine $78.00.

I arrived on a late weekend morning for a lunch with some friends, and it was practically empty when I arrived, which enabled me to take in the surroundings.Very quite and peaceful, comfortable seats, bright with lots of natural light streaming in from the door leading to the outdoor seating.Service was fairly good for the most part, until it came to the serving of our orders. The waiter automatically brought us menus and asked if we wanted any water to start with, as my group of friends arrived one after another.All was good, until, as mentioned above, the serving of our orders. For a restaurant with barely any other customers in sight, the food took ages to arrive. I believe it took as long as 30 minutes for our food to be served each time. Worse, one of the waiters actually asked if we wanted the starter and main to be served together. Excuse me? Isn't it a given that the starter obviously comes first, followed by the main? It created quite a bit of confusion because we were so caught off guard by this question. Amidst the confusion we said to serve the starter, but then the starter AND main came together anyway, after a long wait. And with all those plates on our table, there was barely any space left. We had to shift our plates and glasses around to make space for the food. It was quite a mess and had the feeling of dining from some zi char stall instead.Needless to say, with the starters and mains served at the same time, our mains were left on the table for it to go cold, while we dealt with the starters. I don't know if this played a part or if my main simply wasn't good to start with -- or both, but my CNY special of crispy pork belly turned out to be rather tough. I did not enjoy the dish.At least the Truffle Snow Fries were good, because we had them hot.I really liked the place, but the strange question of whether we want our starter and main to be served at the same time, is really quite ridiculous. They need to sound out their waiters and send them for training, if the word "starter" isn't obvious enough to them on when to serve it

Looking for a good meal in Singapore when everything seemed to be closed for Chinese New Year, we happened upon this great brasserie quite by chance. With no reservations, we were turned away from the well known P.S Cafe, very overcrowded and noisy that day. We walked back down Ann Siang and saw the bar/club just across the street looked open, so I ventured in and asked if they served lunch and to our pleasant surprise we were ushered in and around the corner was this wonderful restaurant. Beautifully decorated in plantation style, the staff were friendly and attentive. They offered helpful advice for our perfect choices. Two of us had the daily special menu, all three courses for a very reasonable price, and our third guest indulged in the foie gras burger...yummy! The decoration is tastefully done with unusual mirrored antique looking panels and black and white photographs of Singapore in bygone days.We will be back for their brunch or the high tea, that last a bargain at 18 SIN

The Disgruntled Chef (Brasserie) is a feast for the eyes, starting from the choices on the menu, presentation of food, and the inventive presentation of the cocktails.And, the taste did not disappoint.Front of Staff house were very attentive, also giving lots of tips of where to get great hawker food. I love to share food, family style, so that I get to try other menu items, but the portions were too small

The branch at Ann Siang has been renamed The Disgruntled Brasserie.Starters was the famous deviled eggs and truffled brioche which was as good as expected.Highly recommended foie gras beef burger and roasted pumpkin agnolotti were delightfully delicious.Chose chocolate fondant and grand marnier soufflÃ© for desert which was the perfect sweet ending

This restaurant in a boutique hotel serves breakfast, lunch and dinner with a small but interesting menu. Service is tops and prices for what you get very reasonable.

The menu is different in the way that the combinations of food are presented. I was very pleased with the special of Crispy Beef ribs which tasted so tender served with a slight hint of a nice flavoured sauce. We ordered the Jamon and the Angel Hair with snow crab, the chicken, and many other dishes and were not disappointed with any, quite the reverse we spent time trying to pick out the flavours and savour them and decided quite unanimously that everything was good, tasty and well presented. The waitress certainly knew the menu well and had given us the suggestions that we were indeed very happy with and satiated

Was a little too quiet but everything was excellent. Would happily go back again. Hopefully more supporters appear!

Another restaurant week offering, we picked Disgruntled as we thought $58 was a good bargain for a dinner which would normally cost at least double. Not surprisingly this was a somewhat scaled down menu.The service is pleasant enough though the staff are somewhat stretched and not all are that knowledgable though they do try hard. We started with the foie gras which was rather good and contrasted well with the toaster fig. Mains was unfortunately a substitution from steak to a combination of pig collar and pig cheek which was average. Desserts was a bit of a mess by the time we came back from a quick puff. All in I would say that the diners might come away somewhat disgruntled. Fortunately for us with 5 bottle of plonk for the 6 of us, we weren't too bothered. However on sobre reflection, I would struggle to give this place a 7.

Came here because hey, it's The Disgruntled Chef and there was a restaurant week offer for $58++. I was impressed with the initial menu shown online (which included foie gras and steak) which appealed to the bourgeois glutton in me. Unfortunately when I checked online again on the day of my reservation, there was a change in the menu - the mains would now be a choice of confit or swordfish. Still cool right??Too bad, when we went there, it became a choice of pork cheek or cod. Granted, these sound like acceptable substitutions, but the dishes were somewhat disappointing. My partner had the codfish, which came with an interesting curry-like sauce, however the inside of the cod was dead tough and dry. It was probably not an isolated incident since we overheard the neighbouring table tell the server the same thing. My pork cheek was soft, succulent and savoury, which I enjoyed, however the pork collar that came with it seemed like something I could get from crystal jade. The starters were up to scratch, at least. Two oysters with yuzu foam, and foie gras with some pastry thing.I was hoping this would be a nice introduction to the restaurant, as we'd never been here, but I think based on this evidence, we will not be returning

I think we were the only ones here when we came. The restaurant has been revamped since its days at Dempsey and I have to admit I liked it better at Dempsey. The scallop carpaccio was out of this world gorgeous. My dinner companions really like the miso cod but I found it too sweet. Service was very good

Ann Siang Road in Singapore is a good place to go... Full of nice restaurants and rooftop bars! The Disgruntled Chef was a good surprise... Good wine... Excellent food... Amazing dessert ;

Ate at the Disgruntled Chef at Ang Siang Road with the family. Restaurant was fairly empty so the ambiance wasn't at its best but my god the food made up for it. The start was a little disappointing as the first 2 different wines we ordered were not available. I would rather the Maitre D let me know in advance what they have and dont have as ultimately it took around 20 mins just to get some wine as we settled on a 3rd choice. We ordered the some starters of Jamon Iberico and ordered the mains for the kids too. Steaks for both the kids and were informed that as we had ordered MW they would take some time. One was a fillet and the other a strip loin. Neither should take longer than 15 minutes to cook MW in fact when they reached the table they were medium at best. Still great flavours and beautiful sauces served with them. The chef really knows how to make a sauce. For me I ordered the Baked Miso Cod with Truffle Fries (Posh Fish & Chips) WOW WOW WOW!!!!!!! if you try one dish on the menu the Miso Cod is a must. The 4 meals were complete with a nice pasta dish. Over all the service was great, food was excellent and a very pleasant experience. I would definitely go back although I suspect the next time I do it will be considerably busier than the first

Food was pricy, but didn't disappoint. The prawn bisque was very nice. With a suprise egg inside. The burger was balanced. Yummy, and the cod was fantastic. Gratin was a let down though. Skip that :)

My husband and I went in when there were lots of tables available but the staff still decided to sat us at the bar and made us wait for over 10 minutes unattended. When we asked why are we waiting when there were clearly tables available. We were told that the staff were too busy to even lead us to a table and give us menus! So we left

Went there for their set lunch menu. The highlight was the scallop carpaccio, though it is not in the set menu. We ordered an extra starter to try. The seafood pasta was good.

Our meal was simply delightful. The brie and truffle brioche was amazing, the Maine lobster and chicken dish was fantastic The service was excellent. But what is really lacking here is atmosphere. The dining room is beautiful and by all accounts it should have been a great night - however the restaurant felt stilted, and missing of life
