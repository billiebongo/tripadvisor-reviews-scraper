Have come here at least 5 times, and would return 55 more. Luxurious beef with great service. Always a lovely meal!

The service was excellent, staff is cheerful, polite and professional. This is our third visit and YAKINIQUEST Wagyu is damn good. The meat melts in your mouth and the quality is very consistent.

My first time there. the meat quality is great. Highly recommanded. I will definitely come back one day.
5
Had the special omakase menu. Beef was just excellent. Sumptuous spread that we all enjoyed thoroughly.
5
The best Mizayaki beef in town. Had the Special Omasake menu again. This was my second visit and it was worth the wait. Great sake options too! Highly recommend. Wonderful ambience and the beef is beautifully grilled for guest for optimum flavour.

I felt good atmosphere here at Yakiniquest. Their service, especially grill the meat at the best time.
5
Best Yakiniku in Singapore, the nikusoumen and sukiyaki are my favorites. I love how the staff take care of you as well.
5
Go for the special omakase course which will take you through different cuts of quality wagyu meat. Leave the expert grilling to the attentive service staff. Interesting presentation with the Niku Soumen (raw waygu cut finely and consumed noodle style in a gentle broth). Will come back again for sure.

Yakiniquest is located in Boat Quay along the waterfront and it is an excellent place for beef yakiniku. The service staff were very friendly and attentive as well.I suppose you get what you pay for as it's clearly not the most wallet-friendly place around. Expect to pay easily more than $100 per diner. That said, would still return given the quality; just probably not as often as I'd like!Try the rib fingers

The advantage to visit this restaurant is to have the chance of tasting many types of Wagyu Beef from different parts of the cow in small portion.
5
Great selection of fresh beef.
Suggest to go for the Japanese wagyu....really juicy and melt in the mouth.
5
We visited as family. first, the service was really good, we did not feel any frustration while eating, and taste of the food was also good!! enjoyed alot
5
We had a course menu of $120.
It was sooo good!!!and hight level one.Yakiniquest must make you happy(((o(*ﾟ▽ﾟ*)o)))♡

This is probably the best yakiniku restaurant in the world. They take yakiniku very seriously here. We had the "Complete Beef Tongue Course", available for limited period only. Everything was delicious, but the best was the beef tongue tanzaku, a slice of the tongue cut horizontally from the root to the tip which allows you to enjoy the different texture and sweetness of the fat. The roast tongue salad was a nice surprise too, something new and creative. And of course the main dish of thick cut tongue steak was perfect too. The only flaw I found was the soy sauce for the tongue sashimi being a bit too strong....I would have preferred a lighter soy sauce or ponzu. What we love about this place is that they come up with special courses now and then, and they never fail to disappoint, keeping us looking forward to their next new ideas to surprise diners.Plus, the service and hospitality is amazing. Can't wait to go back again

Tried special omakase course. From starters to desserts, everything was exquisite. Service was professional yet personal, each slice of meat melted in the mouth, and beer selection was excellent. Highly recommend it for special occasions. Thereâ€™s also outdoor, izakaya overlooking the river if you want something more casual and light.
4
Very convenient location on Boat Quay. Very friendly and attentive staff. Food was good, but not fantastic. Overall, I found the experience a bit pricy for what we got. So while it was a very nice experience, I would not necessarily go rushing back again. For a one-off experience though I would recommend it.
5
Definitely should try it out if you never had Yakiniku. It's all about wagyu, a unique experience, you got to try it out and then decides whether you like it and whether you want to go back.Service was great, they were very professional. It was very up to the standard to guarantee you a great experience. Hope the aircon could be set to lower temperature cuz it was a bit hot.We had the special omakase menu. A great variety of wagyu in different ways of cooking and seasoning. You can make special requirements in advance, like you want some organs, you don't eat organs, etc. There were wagyu sashimi, wagyu soup, different parts of grilled wagyu, etc. A true wagyu feast. I suggest try the wagyu without all the different sauces they provided first, to have a deep insight of the flesh itself. The sauce was sometimes too strong and it totally suppressed the wagyu flavour. You don't get to feel the beautiful flavour of good wagyu meat, like butter.Alcohol was good but not unique. You can buy similar ones from shops outside.Personally, the portion is a bit small. You get 70% full, which is an ideal status for a dinner on a normal day, very healthy. But when you go to a good restaurant, to enjoy a wagyu feast, you certainly want to pamper your appetite, don't you

This is my third visit, and each time it has gotten better. We had the Special Omakase Course.....the wagyu somen (noodle) was amazing! And of course, all the other meat slices were wonderful, cooked to perfection by an expert staff. As usual, service was impeccable, the staff were attentive and quick. This place is really perfect, a heaven for yakiniku lovers!!
5
The best Japanese Wagyu Yakiniku I have ever had, note that I am Japanese! Omakase course starts with fresh raw sashimi beef inc beef somen, thin noodle with 100% wagyu. You will enjoy the best wagyu pieces with salt and pepper, sukiyaki style source, ponzu etc with all original seasonings, you will just enjoy and love this Wagyu Yakiniku experience!

One of the better place for yakiniku in Singapore.
Nice beef with affordable prices.
Recommended to come and try.
5
the beef quality is among the highest i have had outside of japan. the meat was very well seasoned and marinated
5
I had ordered the Special Omakase course which was absolutely delicious and worth the price. The service was impeccable and I appreciated how they cook the yakiniku for you.
5
Staff was professional, friendly and engaging. Food was of top quality. Atmosphere was calm, neat and proper.
5
Nice food and place, great place and will recommend more people to try. good atmosphere for more occasion
5
Food was excellent and service was very attentive. Our table was served by the founder himself and another Japanese lady and both spoke excellent English!
The only downside, the drinks were a bit too expensive
4
Chope did not disappoint. Good service, great food and awesome treatment. Despite the fact that we did not order the Omakase meal in advance, the chef accommodated us.
5
Second visit, this time we ordered the limited wagyu horumon course. The staff who took care of our table was very friendly and informative about each slice of meat. He grilled everything for us which we were glad for, as he seemed to know exactly where to place each slice on the grille, the timing to turn the slice over.....and every slice was grilled to perfection. Their menu is generally very pricey, but each dish is worth it. Even though the portions are small, you will leave feeling extremely satisfied, as each bite is rich and you can enjoy the real flavor of good beef. This place gives a new meaning to yakiniku.
5
Highly recommend trying the beef tenderloin (hire) - the staff grill it to perfection and it melts in the mouth. I really dislike beef that has a strong taste or that's dry - the beef at yakiniquest are juicy, tender, super flavourful, without being overly "beefy". Try having the special omakase set ($120 per pax) as it has a good range of beef parts and the staff grill the meat for you, as compared to ordering ala carte where you have to grill the meat yourself and may not get the timing right. Ala carte portions are small too. Each course in the special omakase set was great, from the starters to the desserts. Highly recommended!
5
A cosy and intimate restaurant with more service staff than customer! Nice change... and very attentive service!The Super Omakase menu which you need to order a day before, is what you must have. An excellent selection of different meats on the menu and specials selected by the Chef! The meats are barbecued to perfection at your table and the different cuts explained. We also had the sake tasting menu which complemented the meal very well... slurp!My only 'complain'? Because there are so many service staff, we felt as if our every move was being observed... a little unnerving...
4
The serving size was just right. We had the smaller omakase menu which cos ~95 and our total bill came to about $400 for two including the Saka flights, and an additional 180ml bottle.
4
Too bad the omakase must be reserved in advance, saw other tables with much better quality meat. But overall, this is a top class Yakiniku joint! Service staff was attentive but a little bit inexperience but they were trying their best.
4
Had a great dinner last night and service was excellent. We were lucky to have the boss grilling the meat. Good value for the quality of beef we got. Portions were just nice.
4
We had a great meal at Yakiniquest. It seems like a truly authentic Japanese experience. However if you're booking for a large group, be sure to book early as they only have a few (or maybe just one) room to accommodate more than 4 people. There was a slight miscommunication on the table when we booked -- we thought we were getting two 4-pax tables side by side but instead they were across the hallway from each other. So effectively we were two groups having dinner separately. The restaurant did apologise (and gave us free sake!) to make up for it though
5
The service was fantastic and the food was amazing. We got the omakase set and was slightly worried if it was too little, but there was no need to worry, as there was more than enough to go around! I have to recommend the tenderloin; it was absolutely superb. The atmosphere was very warm in the restaurant and I have absolutely zero doubts about going back again
5
With it's minimalist exterior, I was taken by surprise by the quality of the food served at Beef Yakiniku Dining Yakiniquest. It was my husband's birthday and he thought to celebrate his special day over Japanese Style BBQ. It was the right choice for us. We savoured the Special Omakase set. Each dish was lovingly prepared by the Chef. We enjoyed the Gyutan and Sirloin especially.
3
Fantastic service and loved the tenderloin very much! I got the omakase set and was a little worried it'd be too little for dinner but it was an adequate amount of food served! Servers were polite when helping to set the table, cook the beef so on and forth. Oh, they also serve very legit black sesame ice cream for dessert!!!!
5
I'm very reluctant to review this restaurant because one part of me wants to keep this great find to myself. But I have benefited a lot from this site in the past. It's the best grilled beef that I've had in Singapore. That's all I'm going to say
5
Together with Yazawa, I think Yakiniquest is one of the best places for Japanese beef in Singapore. Although it's mainly grilled beef, the omakase set includes sukiyaki, teppan steak, sashimi, nitsuke and curry rice styles - basically, all the major cooking methods for beef in Japan, truly an incredible spread. The portions are just nice and altogether filling, the drinks list is small but delicious and interesting. The pacing and gazpacho interlude well thought out. In fact, the gazpacho made me wished they served some citrus or sour soda to help wash down the very rich beef

As a Japanese-culture lover, I always like to try new places that have opened up in Singapore, especially when they have real Japanese roots. For informal dining and excellent quality, this one of the best I’ve tried until now! The owner apparently spent years on a long personal quest to find to find Japan’s most incredible Yakiniku experience, and then brought it to Singapore. I had heard about it from a friend and was intrigued, so I went to try it with a couple of colleagues, and they were just as enthusiastic as I was after the dinner. The Wagyu cuts are a must, brought in fresh from Japan to be prepared as per your liking, directly on your table, which makes for fun conversation and delicious results. We also enjoyed an assortment of traditional rice & noodle dishes by Chef Masaki Akutsu, who was a well-known chef in Tokyo before coming to Singapore for this new culinary adventure. Definitely a place that I would go back with an even larger group of friends, since it’s a great place for sharing the experience. Bravo

I went here with my family to celebrate New Year's Eve dinner. The quality of the meat is superb. The ambience of the restaurant is excellent. The service is also exceptional. Everything about this restaurant is perfect. Will definitely go back here. Fully recommended!! 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽

Absolutely incredible restaurant if you love beef. Great quality, experience and service. One of my favourite restaurants around the world!
5
It was such a good experience having for the first time in my life a 7 or 8 courses tasting menu with the best type of beef which is Japanese WAGOU BEEF. Food was out of this world. Whole idea of cooking your meet to your taste by yourself on the built in barbecue is amazing. I am pretty sure that this evening will stay in our memories for a very long time. Another aspect I have to mention is our waiter who made our dinner unforgettable. The knowledge he shared with us allowed us to understand why every piece of meat was so special. I highly recommend this place to everyone who will visit Singapore
5
This is the best yakiniku in Singapore. Every cut of meat I've had here, and I've been three times, has been melt-in-your-mouth delicious. Prices are expensive, but that's the price for quality in Singapore. On the bright side, drinks are very reasonably priced. For a special occasion, or if you just want some amazing meat with warm, friendly service, I cannot recommend this place highly enough

The air-flown wagyu beef served in Omakase style is a one-of-a-kind experience you get at Beef Yakiniku Dining YAKINIQUEST (a la carte menu is also available but the Special Omakase course is highly recommended). I'm certain that most Japanese will agree that it's more than just a Yakiniku restaurant.Iâ€™ve learned that the master chef of YAKINIQUEST is Japanese and his track record explains why I was able to have such a delightful dining experience outside of Japan. Starting from an appetizer and ending with a Japanese desert. In between, wide variety of beef served in different cut and taste. Fantalicious!! Raw meat dishes (sashimi and Niku-somen) are not currently being served in most Yakiniku restaurants in Japan due to regulations which were imposed recently so I was lucky to savor them in Singapore :)Although my next travel is not confirmed, my dinner venue is confirmed. I have to decide on whom to invite then but I'm confident anyone would enjoy this unique wagyu experience as long as he/she can eat beef

I usually would not go to restaurants in boat quay area as it's mostly for tourists. I decided to try this restaurant because of the raving reviews here and other platforms and also due to the fact that I love Japanese grill meats. We ordered stewed daikon with miso, Japanese green salad and Wagyu beef sushi to start then order tongue, assorted beef and rib eye from a la carte menu. In my opinion the meats were fresh and good value but there was no WOW factor for me. May be I had too high expectations from the reviews or may be the more popular omakase menu is better as some of the items on the a la carte menu was unavailable. The Wagyu sushi was of high quality and very fatty it was like eating toro sushi. The service here is excellent and attentive but not intrusive. We ate upstairs which was more quiet and private and good for dates. Overall I still give it a four stars and I'll be back to try the omakase next time I have a craving for Japanese grilled beef.

Went with my wife to this small Boat Quay restaurant. We went all in having the special Omakase menu at SGD 120 each. The service was discrete and very good and the waitier even asked if we wanted to change the wagyu sashimi since we were coming from overseas. The cuts were thin and delicatly prepared by the waiter and he carefully explained the different cuts
1
I was recommended by a friend who thinks that this is the best yakiniku in Singapore. Being Yakiniku lovers, my wife and I managed to find time to try out this restaurant (We are in Singapore for 3 days 2 nights).The table and grill is similar to Gyukaku that we went the night before. We are shocked when we saw the menu as the price is exorbitant. But with very high expectation as this is claimed to be the best in singapore, we tried the recommended normal beef and wagyu, and some side dishes. Unfortunately, the food quality are so so. We were not impressed at all.We won't be back
5
We really enjoyed our visit to this restaurant. We chose the $120 tasting menu and was not disappointed it was a fabulous experience and our chef explained exactly what we were eating and cooked the meats for us at our table. It was delicious and memorable. Definitely recommend this restaurant for something a little bit out of the ordinary
5
This Japanese barbecue restaurant in Boat Quay is a real gem! The quality of beef is absolutely impressive and the service is excellent. Although it is a bit expensive, I would definitely visit there again when I visit Singapore. It's difficult to find such quality Yakiniku restaurant anywhere in the world
