I went in for quick dinner, Spaghetti Bolognese, and the spaghetti was overcooked and too thick The meat sauce not that good either. It was very very expensive, the bread didn't taste that good, they didn't even have the pepper grinder, and basically fell short of basic expectations. It used t be much better, maybe its a change of management.. I hate to give such a low rating, because the restaurant used to be much much better. but S$48 for spaghetti and water was just too expensive for a poorly prepared and served meal.

We've been passing by the Trattoria L'Operetta as far back as I can remember but it was only last night that we went in for dinner - and boy, what a meal that was! But first let's talk about the sombre ambience of the place and I mean that in a sort of intriguing kind of way. The indoor lighting is turned down low and the place gives off a little bit of the "Godfather" vibe - which I like. The staff was lovely and on their toes. And the food, of dear heavens, the food! The ravioli tasted so good I had to stop myself from licking the sauce off the plate. We also ordered the parma ham pizza with a dollop of arugula and it was truly glorious! Certainly one of the best woodfire oven pizzas I have ever had. L'Operetta is such a wonderful discovery in our neighbourhood and we are definitely going back there a few more times

A cozy neighborhood-type restaurant with quaint Italian ambience. My second time there and the pasta remains good. We had the prawn aglio olio and crab meat pasta, both were above average. The roast chicken was pretty good too. Wine prices were reasonable and service friendly. Would return to try other stuff.

Love in the Neighbourhood and have been coming here for more than 4 years.The draw is the wood pizza oven that they have here which just seems to do a better job on pizza than all the other wood ovens in Singapore. It is definitely like pizza from Italy.Went last night and enjoyed a buffala pizza. Just a simple tomato and buffalo mozerella but it tasted great.Earlier on we are often able to get a walk in table. By about 7 it seems to start getting busier. Seems to be a popular place on most nights and the staff are very good and helpful

A quaint little restaurant that seems to be popular for their pizzas.I ordered escargots, squid ink pasta and pizza with Parma ham. The escargots fell short of expectations with bread by the side that did not enhance the flavor of the escargots in any manner. In fact the tastes seemed to clash and the escargots were not utilized to their full potential. The pizza came next and it had a layer of cheese that was pretty good but the overall taste was to put it simply -- bland. The rocket salad that dotted the pizza and the Parma ham was simply just there for decoration. The ingredients did not come together in a manner that satisfies the palate and the pizza was disappointing, lacking the special something that pizzas usually have. Lastly we had the squid ink pasta. In a word the pasta just tasted weird. There was some kind of herb that was sprinkled on top of the pasta and when combined with a sweet(?) sauce just tasted bad. The pasta was well cooked but the sauce just screamed off. Overall would not visit again despite the good service.

Yesterday, we had great meal at this trattoria. nice ambiance; you feel like you are in Italia. Extremely friendly and attentive staff. We had some delicious starters; Parma ham and garlic bread with excellent olive oil. Pizza were yummy. Espresso with home made biscotti and glass of Italian liquor for us and small ice cream for kids, to finish off.

I very much enjoyed their special course meals along with the best quality of fresh white truffle and surprisingly flavorful white truffle oil. The food was delicious and the service was fantastic. All wines that we had during the course was chosen by the owner of the restaurant, and absolutely well matched with each dishes! The staff were welcoming and very well trained. I have been to the Operetta restaurants including ones in other location more than 7 times, and I have never been disappointed at the quality of food and service. I wouldn't complaint about the prices at all, considering the quality of the food and the attention to detail. Lastly, I would love to say there is a dessert that I would personally recommend is their home-made basil sorbet. This is one of my favorite dessert here

this restaurant gave us the best white truffle experiences. the white truffle which is 20 times more expensive than black one was everywhere! like, even on vanilla ice cream ! surprisingly the white truffle matches so well. i believe the cost performance is one of the top in Singapore.don't forget to ask some Toscana wines, their variation is definitely the best

My last visit was in July and there was an Italian Chef. Service staffs were Korean? lady and some Singaporeans. I was not impressed at all last time but this time, I truly amazed by sudden improvement of service and food. They have changed chef to a Japanese who trained in one star restaurant in Italy and owner himself was giving quite enjoyable services with well trained staffs. What a big change! I think this place now becomes one of the best dining spot in East Coast of Singapore with special service and truly authentic Italian cuisine. We hope this will not change and we decided to use this place as our regular dining spot. Also Pizza is one of the best in Singapore after I tried so many for past four years! Must try

went in 10mins to 10pm and realised that their last order is 10.30pm. didn't want to 'disturb' so we left. their Ops Mgnr then noticed us still hanging around outside and observing the pizza man by the window and he came out to invite us in still! despite being so close to closing time.very impressed by his service. very patient & detailed & sincere recommendations. pizza came a little burnt, and he was very honest to us about it. told us if we werent pleased, we could request for a new one. pizza didn't taste that bad, in fact it was quite good! both of us were more than satisfied (: kept on checking on us if we needed anything (: cleared our dishes as soon as we were done. very attentive, interactive as well.received the bill and realised he had given us a discount. probably because of the burnt pizza. would definitely return for his amazing service and try out the rest of the menu. made our evening, thankyou

Fine Italian cuisine. Lovely atmosphere and decoration. Perfect place to bring your beloved one. According to me the pizza should be a little bit bigger, however it tastes great! The staff there is sweet and take good care of the customers.

The food was delicious and all the ingredients were fresh. Our food was served quickly and the tables are placed in such a way that there is an open concept, yet each table has its own private space.

The pizza here is one of the better ones I had since Rome. Do order the pizza!!
Service here is excellent too...
Do also look out for their offer.. it is rather affordable compared to other similar restaurants in town.

Saturday lunch. The restaurant is pretty, nice Italian setting, the large pizza oven near the entrance looks like they know their food, and there's Chef there preparing our bread. Good start?Bread came piping hot, was really tasty, except it's quite salty. BUT out of the 4 servings I ate 2 mouthful full of salt. I have to spit them out. Unsightly I know.. The food came less than hot. The cream pasta is something I can cook even better. The quality is somewhere less than what I will get from pasta mania. Taste wise it's just salty, the cream is like clear soup, consistency and taste is not there.Expensive yet...Until today I still feel the pinch..

We popped in for Sunday lunch. The Japanese chef was on duty, as was his wife who was helping in the front.We ordered the prawn linguine and their new Hawaiian pizza. The prawns were large and juicy, though the pasta sauce was too salty. The pasta was cooked nicely and was al dente though.The pizza was nice, crusty and tasty. I liked the pineapple slices, which were nicely sweet and went well with the ham. They also provided some pizza bread slices which were nice with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.Service was good and the Japanese lady was quick to provide water etc at each table

I ordered a pizza and a glass of wine. I asked for a side of vegetables and they would not sell it to me unless I ordered an entrÃ©e.This is an ungracious attitude at best. I cannot understand the reasoning behind refusing to sell something because I am not spending enough. All I wanted was pizza and something healthy. My bill was $32.00 for a very small portion of food and wine. Bad experience. Won't be going back

We live not far from this restaurant and were attracted by its cozy decor - it creates very nice typical italian trattoria ambiance, but the food is a real disappointment.. The presentation of food is good, however, filling of ravioli is a bit cold inside.. spaghetti cartoccio was overcooked and soft - al dente? not at all... and pizza calabrese, we don't even sure if we could call it that name, because there was a point of time we thought they served the wrong pizza... we were expecting to see the typical round shape salame on top of pizza, but there were only small tiny pieces of it.We spent 120 dollars for three pax, food with 1 beer (not to say the beer is bit sour). Maybe we set expectation too high? anyway it will be our first & last time

Bread didn't come until we chased several times and then the waiter admitted he overlooked. Food was jus average. Ordered a prawn pasta which tasted dry n bland. Pizza was too soft n soggy. Hard to get the attention of the waiters despite waving so many times and it wasn't even full house. Quite a frustrating and disappointing experienc
2
Ordered a prawn and rocket leaves spaghetti. Pasta came really fast (too fast maybe) 5 mins after ordering. It was dry and under seasoned. I reckon supermarket pasta sauce would taste better.Pizza was alright. not the best not the worse. Complimentary bread was stale and dry.Service was better than average though

We have walked past several times after dining at the nearby Punggol nasi lemak, so decided to give it a try for dinner. And we were glad we did.Service was warm and friendly, and yet very efficient. Our meal was well paced and we finished within 75 minutes. The Japanese matre'd and the lady server were attentive and our water was topped up regularly without prompting.We had the pate de campagne, which was served in a little bowl with some rather hard bread, a dash of vinegar and a dollop of plum jam. It was rich, yet not oily. We also went with three kinds of antipasto, kind of a trio of surprise small dishes by the Japanese chef/owner. This evening, we got two slices of proscuitto, a carrot and chicken salad, and truffled potatoes, which was our favourite of the evening.A close second for favourite dish was the tagliatelle bolognese. The hand-made pasta was very fresh and cooked well, and the bolognese was rich with nice chunks of beef.We also ordered pizza macellaio, which had chicken, ham and some bacon we beleive, and was delicious.The free bread basket was not as good though - we thought the breadsticks etc were a little hard. All in all, however, it was a great meal and we will definitely return

L'Operatta is one of my Favourite Italian restaurants and one I would recommend to my family and friends. Pizza and pasta are awesome and friendly to the wallet. Their Tiramisu is one of the best in town!

Our local favourite Italian. Good pizzas from the woodfired oven. Great wagyu beef tataki on the special menu. Our son loves the parmasan risotto. All round good but simple Italian food. Nice athmosphere and friendly service.

We were very hungry, we went there with high expectation because of the price. The staff is very attentive and quick, place is nice and the food is normal, good quality.

My 3rd visit here. Not one time was I disappointed. Twice I had wine pairing. The sommelier could gauge my preference and no wine served was disappointing. As a nearby residence, I am lucky to have a restaurant like this in my neighborhood.

Open concept kitchen, huge pizza oven, high ceilings, exposed beams and brickwork, vintage furnishings and bric à brac, plus racks of untold bottles create oodles of atmosphere in the Katong shophouse that’s been home to Trattoria L’Operetta for the past four years. It’s by no means the only Italian restaurant in this foodie haven; but as we’re about to discover, this joint has something a bit different up its sleeve for us – Japanese executive chef Takashi Okhawa. Highlights include just about everything we put in our mouths: an amuse bouche of melba toasties – chicken liver pâté with fig, taleggio cheese with black truffle; burrata cheese with prosciutto, rocket and baby tomatoes ($32); memorably sea-fresh sautéed langoustines with eggplant purée ($48 when available à la carte, and also featured on Chef’s occasional omakase menus); bee-yoo-ti-ful house-made tagliolini with Hokkaido sea-urchin and bottarga ($38); grilled Ìberico pork ($28), surprisingly and deliciously pink and tender and served with a caponata of mixed vegetables ; and an exquisitely simple tiramisu ($10).  House wines by the glass include a nice Prosecco ($12; $68 per bottle) and a quaffable Montepulciano Illuminati ($14; $68).Prices aren’t exactly low-end – today’s specials include an 800g T-bone at $118, for example – but there are well-priced alternatives, including antipasti at $10 each, plus three pages of authentically Neapolitan pizzas that look and are amazing, according to East Coast friends of ours who regularly pop in just for that. And all, remember, from the hands of a brilliant chef

We accidentally discovered this restaurant as we were walking down the road and managed to get a seating as the place was virtually empty. With apprehensions in mind, we ordered our drinks - however they mostly service wines only but they managed to serve us Black Label on request. The chef who is from Japan personally attended to us and whipped up an interesting menu of salads and main course which was delicious. The dessert Tiramisu was thoroughly enjoyable and we actually liked this place feeling we will visit again

I used to love the pizza margerita at the katong location from when it first opened. but 6 weeks ago on a sunday afternoon I had a craving for their pizza. I went and brought one home. it was mediocre and 2 hours later my partner had tummy upset but recovered. next day and for 2 days I developed a fever of 103 degrees. I must have picked up some virus or bacteria because I was completely fine until I ate the pizza. co-incidence or was the person who prepared my pizza sick. sorry, I loved the place but not taking anymore chances

It's a great pizza place near to my house. One evening around 6 pm we arrived. It looks like it's owned by a Japanese because of beverage selection and staff background. Nevertheless, pizza was nice but other items were so so. Ambiance is just like any other neighborhood place. Will I go back? Probably if I want to have pizza but lazy to cook. Yes. Not recommend for a romantic date although I saw many couples coming in with dressed up. There are so many other options in town.

I suggested Pizzeria L'Operetta at Icon Village Tanjong Pagar for a business lunch after one satisfying dinner date. It was a good choice. L'Operetta offered Lunch Set Menu that included one pasta dish and drinks. We ordered the set with Carbonara, Bolognese and a pizza. We enjoyed the food as well as the service and the companionship. The Carbonara was not overwhelmingly creamy, but it was rich enough. Perhaps this is the delight of the lunch. Will I come back? Definitely yes
