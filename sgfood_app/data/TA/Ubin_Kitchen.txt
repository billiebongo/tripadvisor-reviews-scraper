Came here for lunch on the 7th day of CNY. Wonderful service despite how packed the restaurant was! Great Kong Bak Pau and Lo Hei. The longevity buns are worth trying as well. Will certainly visit again.

I had the food from this restaurant for take away. They packed food nicely and I enjoyed their food at home.
The cooking style seems to be typical Chinese and the ingredients are fresh.
The price is quite reasonable.
This is now my favorite place.

This place may bring back some memories for some ....
Many of the dishes still taste the same throughout the years.
Come here for some local style of seafood.

The place was clean and prices not too outrageous given no surcharge.
Food was ok but would not say fantastic.
Would I go back? No not likely.

what a lovely little find. stumbled across it with friends and was greeted warmly by staff who helped us through the menu to select a delicious feast of food. Chilli crab, claypot and sizzling beef plus a very nice Indonesian wheat beer at 4.5 sing a pop. nearly fell of my chair when the bill came.. outstanding value.. so good I had to tell the chef personally....

This place is popular among locals where they offers singapore authentic dishes, serve in big portion (so you better come with bunch of friends or families), but in affordable prices. Don't miss their popular Chili Crab served with crunchy mantau bun. Other popular dishes is Salty Egg Shrimp which will makes you want more and more

Always enjoy my visit to this restaurant because of the friendly service. Tried for the first time their set meal menu. We ordered black pepper beef rice + egg and bitter gourd fish rice + egg at $6.90 each meal with free flow of homemade barley. Food is satisfactory. No service charge n GST absorbed for set meal. Will come again when they roll out their clay pot rice

I have been there a few times, not that I like the food so much, it is just because easy to get table even without having tonnage reservation. Though they are supposed to be a seafood restaurant even with a few tanks there, the crab bee hoon is a bit disappointed. It is not tasty and unable to absorb the freshness of the crab into the bee hoon. The rest of the dishes (ie fried baby squid, fish cooked in 3 ways, veggie....)we're not too bad but I will not say that I will miss their food

We had a craving for Crabs and went to Ubin Kitchen having read that the food is good and no 10% service charge (rare in Singapore restaurants). Restaurant was quite full and tables seemed to be waiting for their dishes. Thankfully, our food came in about 20mins. Ordered Oyster Hokkien Mee which was one of their oldest dish ($10 - small). Was delicious with a thick flavorful gravy. Had Honey Pork Ribs ($3.50 per pc, min 4pcs). Meat was tender. Finally, the Chilli Crab ($52/kg) crab was small, sauce more tomato based than spicy, crab was quite fresh though. Spent $80.65 including 7%gst. Would be back to try their other dishes. Service was friendly. Enjoyed the dinner
