I love how fresh the food is and the variety. Cedele's toss and turn is a great salad place, with a range of other options too. One of my favourite eating places in Singapore (even compared to those much more expensive and exclusive places).

Fresh salads, very good sandwiches and the soup is not full of sugar and salt
Will be back must try the pastrami sandwich

This place has a constant turn around of customers so wait for a seat and one will soon become available, though you may have to share tables or bench space. It’s a busy hive for the fresh foodies. Salads are made to your order and the serves are generous. There were 5 soup varieties and I ordered the wild mushroom, large serve at $8.80, with bread on the side, and it was delicious. Open mesh chairs in the cafe space are modern and colourful, but the plastic white chairs have to go - very dirty and distracting! Food is great - now work on the decor a bit more.

This cafe is a little like a Subway but so much better! You choose a salad base, add a protein item (hot or cold), and four extra's, and a dressing and there you are a HUGE bowl of tasty, fresh salad. A good range of fresh juices and smoothies, and desserts too

I like the salads here. You get to pick and choose items to make your own salad. There is a good variety of greens, grains and carbs, I like it that they have soba and smoked salmon. The portion size of salmon seems to vary with the server. I don’t like the so called hot mains because they are hardly ever hot so I have given up on them. I stilck with the salads and cold proteins which make a good meal (for one hungry person or two small eaters)

came by here for lunch on a recommendation. it was a good choice. the variety and price are excellent. except for one or two veggies which were not so nice (old ladies finger and overcooked broccoli which was served to me), the meal was very good. my favorite item is the pasta which was so flavorful. the ice tea completed the meal and it was a very satisfying one. the restaurant has a good layout as well

At the time of this review, I have been to this establishment 4 or 5 times within the last few years. I try my best to visit Toss & Turn whenever I am in Singapore, because the food tastes great and wholesome, and I like the nutritious variety for vegetarians (it is not a vegetarian establishment, but it is vegetarian-friendly. I suppose vegans should be safe here as well).In addition, the servings are generous and the prices are quite decent! I will continue to visit this establishment whenever I next visit Singapore, and I hope they will maintain their standards

Nutritious and healthy food! I love the diy concept with the various choices of salad bases and toppings. All of the toppings are fresh and taste great. The base of soba noodles is amazing as well as the Cous cous. The price is great considering the serving sizes are huge! I always feel so satisfied and full after eating here!

This place is create for a make your own salad. We went twice for lunch. The salad was large and delicious. There are sets you can order which include salad, soup and drink, good value for lunch. If you are in Vivo check this place out for lunch.

My favourite place for salad lunch . Body detox. Wholesome lunch.
You get to choose the items in two station. I like my salad without any dressings.

Din't like it much , vegetarian options were very limited.
Vivocity has better places that offer good variety of soups and salads.

If you want something healthy yet filling, toss and turn is the place to go. The food is fresh and clean. It is also tasty and the portions are generous. Even for a big eater like me, the normal salad will fill my tummy. It does get crowded during lunch time so you may want to pack it to go since seats are a premium.

I loved the "create your own salad" concept where you choose the add-ons (they have a wide variety...mushrooms, beans, couscous, etc.), the dressing, and the hot protein you want to go with your greens. My sister and I took a long time to finish everything. Love that there's a place like this in SG in the middle of all the places serving fried, oily, and spicy food. Very refreshing.

We had chicken and pork as main. Both meat re bland and dry. The sauce/gravy does not fuse with the meat. It like eating two separate thing. The sauce is also very oily. Not all the side comes in one price. You have to TOP up for certain vegetable and carbohydrate. Staff seems to favour Caucasians, they are served bigger portions

If you're trying to stay healthy while shopping, Toss and Turn is the best place to head to! They have sets for salad - with drinks/ small or large soups. For salad, you can choose vegetable base and/or spaghetti, 2 deli proteins, 4 vegetable/nut add-ons. For me I normally get a salad and top it off with a soup (the beef stew is really awesome) for $13.00. If you're hanging out with your friend, you could drop by for some cakes and muffins made by Cedele! Not absolutely healthy, but they try all means to make it so. For desserts prices range from $4 to $7/8. Every time I go there for salad, I'd spend 3 minutes contemplating on getting a cake, which is $6.50/ slice for most of them. Personally I feel that this salad combo is the most affordable of all places I've eaten at. Good food, great ambience, top it up with great company, your day is made. Disclaimer: I'm not paid to write this review. I'm just hoping that more people would get to experience great food and service. Cheers and have a great day shopping or exploring Vivo City!

The salad comes choice of protein n deli which is good. And the portion is really BIG. Really worth the money. However, the service is not superb. They don't bother to tell you "I'll attend to you shortly" when they see there is a queue. They just continue what they are doing: preparing sandwich, collecting money

I regularly lunch at Toss & Turn and I am always very satisfied. This is the best salad restaurant in town, the owners take time to source quality ingredients and have succeeded in creating a heathy and very tasty salad bar to choose from. They also serve great sandwiches, wraps and soup too! Delicious!

This review is actually for the Ion branch which I visited a couple of days ago. I wanted a healthy meal, particularly a salad, so we chose this. I ordered a Caesar extra, and had to tell them to take out some of the extras which really didn't go with a Caesar salad, e.g. big ham cold cut, prawns (allergic) and pineapple. It came with green olives, but the olives were whole and with pits, so really not easy to eat. The egg came whole. The bacon wasn't in bits but long pieces half chopped. They put the greens first, then the toppings and finally the dressing, and then served it like that. The best salad shops I've been in mix them, with ingredients already chopped to bite size pieces.On the plus side, the dressing and the chicken sandwich my wife ordered were both tasty.When I gave feedback after the meal, the manager told me some customers like their eggs whole, and that the ingredients came that way from their central store. I suggested they give the feedback to their central store to chop some of the ingredients.Not sure I'll go back again. There are more and more options coming up for healthy option seekers like me

Tasty roast chicken feta salad and tropical chicken salad. Great portion however presentation wise was a bit overwhelm, also it was quite challenging to have the sauce and variety of ingredients mixed well. Chicken was dry in both salad. Tables were not cleared as swiftly as the staff taking your order at the counter line.
