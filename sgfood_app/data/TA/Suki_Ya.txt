Most value for money steamboat which I really like. After they move to current level 4, they have soft serve. Better than expected, which I like.

Overall experience was good. Would be even better if there are more varieties of food to cook. Staffs were prompt to responses

Awesome place to dine with children. We tried four kinds of soup base and they are all really good. Don’t miss this opportunity!

A nice restaurant if u want to have a healthy eating. I had a well balanced lunch here with lots of fresh meat and vegetables but the selection is abit limited.

Good experience. Friendly staff and decent quality of food. Will visit again for buffet dinner soon!

Forget any semblance of an authentic Japanese experience. This is essentially good value for average food with average service.

It was a good experience at jap buffet as it was my first time and that's really not bad to try! Just that soup is quite thick

The pork and beef are decent and good slice compared to most of other establishment.Thinly sliced and not so much fat on it. Condiments dressing were in great varieties including mala chili, spicy peanut sauce, ponzu, chopped garlic, spring onion, soya sauce and pounded chili. Soup are with few varieties to choose. Each table is allowed to have types of soup. We chose kimchi and pork broth base. For the price of $21.10 net per pax during lunch time, each diner is entitled to one free-refill drinks.The green is fresh. The selection of meatball is of a quality. Try the shitake ball and lobster ball.They are delicious, but if you take these too much, you will have no space to try the quality meat.Service was alright if there is nothing to shout about. The ambience was great as there was not too noisy

 Bit of fun for the whole family ! They have J-pop going on loudly in the background. Choose your soup base - 2 types. And then buffet away! The honest truth was that we couldn’t eat that much. The items for the buffet were cheap but what do you expect? Kids had the cheap ice creams no water but very sweet drinks. Vegetables / noodles and free flow of meat. But they have a time limit so you can’t stay here for hours

Even though I love good quality food, I like the idea of going to an all you can eat once in a while. They offer duo broth pot so can have one each. This place quite similar to what I am used to, having a veggie and fish balls station, carbs station and you can add a few dollars for free flow of soft drinks too. The meat is alright especially at this price. I would not recommend anyone who's particular with the quality of meat to come here and the place is kind of fishy smelling as most of the cheap all you can eat places are. One comment to the management is to provide free tap water please. They're nice enough to serve tea but I did not manage to find water. Please note that ice cream is only included for dinner but not lunch. Happy customers and will consider going back.

The buffet spread was good, meat was fresh. But the time limit was strictly adhere to whereas other Suki ya outlets will not chase if there's no customer waiting for table.

Not worth to top up the premium meat. Very disappointed with the Wagyu beef slice. Might can improve on the food quality.

Value for money. I like the style of meat are serve on request which is good for food safety and hygiene purpose.

Fairly good concept of combination Chinese steamboat and Japanese sukiyaki. You are allowed 2 soup bases in one deep soup pan. I recommend sukiyaki and pork-bone base. From the meat, you can choose thinly sliced sukiyaki beef, pork or chicken. These are "refillable".The rest of the ingredients can be selected at the buffet table. They offer different types of vegetables, seafood and meat balls, tofu, mushrooms and noodles. You can also make your own dipping sauces depending on your taste buds. Add raw egg to your sukiyaki dip for that extra rich goodness. Rice is also available together with hot or iced lemon tea, green tea and soda. Both are available beside the veggies.Once you've gotten everything beside you, get ready to enjoy the comfort offered by hot sukiyaki. Will be super heavy on the tummy, but guaranteed to satisfy. Expect a queue during peak lunch and dinner times.

Overall, the dining experience at Suki-Ya (Plaza Singapura) is very good. We ordered Shabu Shabu and Sukiya soup base. The unlimited servings of beef, pork and chicken are definitely a plus point for the meat lovers. You can also pay an additional amount for premium beef/ pork. Vegetables, cakes and ice creams are also available. However, you need to pay $1 for the free flow of drinks.

The service crews were kinda helpful; but the Old Female Manager (Suki-Ya @ Plaza Sing) was pain-in-the-@ss. I arrived 5 mins earlier than booking time and requested to go to my reserved table to wait for my friends, she refused and demanded All 6 of us need to presence then she will allow us to sit in. I was quite piss off and planning to cancel the booking. I waited outside the restaurant and till one of my friends arrived first, we approached one of the crew to let us go in after the Mean Manager stepped away. This is damned outrageous to ask your customer to wait till all members to arrive then allow to enter, especially came from Manager herself. I was planning to rate this experience TERRIBLE. The Food and Service were Okay, could have been better, faster response to and more attentive to customers needs and calling

I initially reserved a party of 5 pax but when reached (on time), was informed that my table that catered to my party size was already taken by another group. When asking the staff why my table was given away although I was neither late nor without reservation, they were unable to provide me a table to seat my group of 5. I had to approach the manager twice, personally, to demand something be done and resolved with agreeing to pay for 4 pax since my table catered to 4 pax max. Overall I was appeased at the solution but disappointed that I had to first approach the staff for a resolution than one offered to me

This was my second time here, the first time i had it at tampines and it was rather delicious. However i was very disappointed this time round. There were very limited selection of food and the food were not fresh. The most depressing part was that the butaniku soup base was tasteless. I was surprised at such a dip in the food quality when this outlet is located in the central district. Total bill came up to $60 for 2. It was honestly not worth the money.Lastly the staff informed us that we have to finish our dinner in 10 mins when the entire place was rather empty. There is a chinese saying 'regulations are dead, people are alive'. I was hoping that since the quantity of food is so lousy, the customer service would be better to make it up for it. But sadly, both are equally a mess. This is not a place i would recommend or visit again.

Really love to have free flow meat and steamboat together so I went on for Suki-Ya by introduction of a good friend of mine. Well, it was really worth the price! Add on money for Wagyu Beef but really, it's not too much money. Ice cream, noddles, rice, vegetables like normal buffet. Free flow soft drinks, however limited choices.However, I was really upset by the overwhelming number of people queuing for it. Lunch and dinner always tends to be full of people especially over the weekend. A note, if you want to have Suki-Ya over the weekend, do try out neighbourhood malls as many people goes to Suki-Ya here at Dhoby Ghaut for dinner after work with their colleagues and queuing for a table is really tough.

Food choices is very limited. Vegetables are not fresh and I found a rotten tomato with the bowl of tomatoes. Manager just picked up the tomato and wanted to walked off. I commented that she should at least wash the whole bowl of tomatoes. Staff are not attentive and do not bother to explain much. Will never patronise again
