We enjoyed the duck that they are famous for. They also serve kway chap and braised meat rice. For the price point and the friendly staff there, it is definitely worth going back. The place is non-aircon though, so it may be rather hot sometimes.

Average braised duck rice. Not fantastic. Pricing is considered as okay.
Do consider better eating outlets along the same street.

This restaurant has the best Kueh Chap in Joo Chiat Area. There are others around Joo Chiat/Eunos Area but cannot match Yu Kee serving piping hot soup with the kueh chap. Their braised duck is inconsistent- sometime tender, another time tough. The price is reasonable. I go there for their kueh chap only

I have been there many times. Service has always been very good. All staffs are smiling. The menu is quite diverse even if it looks like this is Duck only. My parents from France came and loved it too. So good food, good service, good Location, children friendly at a very affordable price.

This shop with a green signboard and yellow wordings, is located in Joo Chiat Place, Singapore. It is an open-front shop cooled by fans instead of air-conditioners and as the name suggests, they serve braised duck and related food that usually go along well with it, like braised boiled eggs, tofu, bean curd skin, stewed mustard greens & the whole works. The dishes are served with their special oily rice, white rice or noodles, and they have “Koay Chap” too, which is a kind of thick flat rice noodles covered with duck soup & meat.The dishes are simple but more importantly tasty and prices are very reasonable. It draws a good lunch crowd and their popular dishes are usually sold out fast. Go early if you want to savour their whole menu. We tried an assortment of their dishes and I must tell you that their food was above the average fare and would put many a food outlet in Singapore to shame. Anytime, this place is worth a go

We were slightly hesitant as the place look deserted at first glance. However, I must say we didnt make a wrong choice. Duck is excellent and you have your usual side dishes, eg. salted vegetables, peanuts, tao pok, tao gua, etc. They have both white and brown rice, kwai chap and best of all, they literally have 3 chilli sauces to suit your taste

A shop on a row of old pre-war houses, near Tembeling Lane.Clean simple non aircon (good ventilation) restaurant with no wifi. Simple tasty dinner at $4 per person. Totally reasonable and acceptable. Enjoyed. Will visit again.Limited parking space on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evening

We had passed by this eatery when eating at Fei Fei wanton noodles previously, and decided to have lunch here today. And we were glad we did. This is really much better than the stall that we go to in Macpherson.The braised duck was tasty and was not gamey in taste at all, though the meat slices could have been thicker. The sauce was full of body, with a touch of herbal, and we liked the broth so much that we asked for refills. The salted vegetables were also nice, though the portion was smallish. We also ordered braised pork with a hard boiled egg, and the pork was tender and flavourful. The three different types of chilli tied it all up nicely and I enjoyed the meal with a bowl of kway chap and a bowl of rice. My wife had a bowl of noodles but it did not go as well.A meal for two, including two iced teas, came up to S$20. Service was normal, and what you would expect
