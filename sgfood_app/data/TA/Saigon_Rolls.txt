Authentic tasty vietnamese rolls are hard to come by in Singapore, and at an average of 3+ per roll, with fresh ingredients, larger-than -average portions and abundant sauces, this has got to be one of my favourite places for Vietnamese food. unfortunately, this joint does not provide seating area for dining in, a shame because Im sure a crowd will ensue and business would be brisk
