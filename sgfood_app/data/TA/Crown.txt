Waited more than 25 mins in total for 3 plain waffles. Poor service. They finally arrived cold, hard and deformed. Not worth the wait at all. For 8 dollars for a plain waffle, I can certainly find better ones out there. Will not return.

4 stars because I would return for the bread. It's a great place for those looking for a simple yet comforting breakfast. They have fresh and good bread selection. However, their Coffee is weak. Unfriendly service crew.

flat white with additional espresso shot taste good but the matcha latte taste milky more than the matcha.

They do fresh baked everyday and open early at 730am. I do enjoy my every single meal here.
Today I am going to try their Royal Eggs Royale. (Cross finger it won't disappoint me!) The sourdough waffles is always good too!

Crown Bakery has nice breads and coffee is good. I recommend the ciabattas and also their signature big breakfast.

I came here for breakfast, zero service waited for half an hour for my food, I had to go looking for it, eventually I got it. I don't understand why a buzzer exists, if I have to go searching for my food. That was the least of my woes, my coffee was cold. Normally, when I pay for a cup of coffee, I expect the coffee to be full in the cup, see pic below. how one can serve coffee like this, I don't know. I had finished the so called cup of coffee 25 mins before my food, I will not return and would not recommend

Very good bread with an interesting selection and decently priced.Food menu and selection also good range. The steak sandwich on Ciabatta was really very good (tender and juicy and melt in the mouth steak). Bread is light, tasty and not sweet.Chocolate banana french toast - delicious and the ABC juice, fresh and natural flavours. Coffee decent.Prices are reasonable considering the care and time to make such good quality breads. Personally, I find this to be one of the best bakers in Singapore

Came here for another cafe that was too crowded and ended up in this cafe. Latte was nicely done, tasty. Ordered Marinara Baked Eggs, which required 15mins, taste good too. Just that they should let me know that it takes 15mins when I am ordering. Overall, a nice & cosy place to enjoy coffee, bread and take a break

This bakery sells great breads and Western/Japanese pastries to take away, but you can also eat it. The breakfast/brunch menu is very nice, especially the fresh waffles with scrambled eggs and other toppings (bacon, avocado), and the French toast with berries. On weekends, can be a bit crowded in the morning

The baked goods Crown offers are fantastic to my mind. I've never been disappointed with what I've bought (usually baguettes, croissants, and some sweet pastries) They offer a wide selection of standard European bakery fare (baguettes, ciabatta, croissant, even bagels - as well as cinnamon buns, pan au chocolate, and almond croissants). They also offers some radical things, like Japanese macha tea loafs and hainanese chicken bread. I've never eaten at Crown Bakery, so I cannot comment on the quality of service and the restaurant food prices (as others in this forum have). But, strictly as a bakery, the prices are fantastic (e.g. $3 for a full size baguette) and seem like a great deal given the quality of the products. So I would strongly recommend coming here to pick up your baked goods.
