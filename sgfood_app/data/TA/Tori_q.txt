My husband and I had dinner at Tori-Q, Ion. It was busy and we had to wait in line. However we managed to find a table and enjoyed the yaki-tori. The food was delicious. We will be back for more.

Love the toriyaki with rice. Inexpensive, yummy and quick. They have many branches. I always go to the one in ION which has a sizeable sitting area. Must try!!!

It was crowded when we got there. Loved the set meals. My daughter would usually get a set A or B, and also add on a stick of chicken skin! Who would eat that? Actually doesn't taste that bad. Usually we are lucky enough to get seats to eat before going off.
