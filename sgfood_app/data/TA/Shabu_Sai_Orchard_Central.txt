Great places to dine and not expensive with free flow of meats for meat lovers. Wide varieties of vegs, fruits, sushi and many more item which is value for money.
Staff are friendly and good comfortable places to eat

We went for weekend dinner. Chose the Sukiyaki and collagen broth. Meats not great but sufficiently decent. Rest of buffet consisted of mushrooms/veges, the usual hotpot ingredients eg fishballs and beancurd. They also have a small selection of sushi rolls. We liked the food and concept. Good value. Limited to 90minutes dining for weekend dinner. They do not take reservations on weekends and we noticed the croud only builds up from 630pm onwards

Me and my friend were there for lunch buffet @ orchard central branch. The food quality is good especially the beef and tonkotsu soup base. However there is this Indian staff is very rude and arrogant. The way he talk to customer very rude and its not acceptable in service line. Please improve on this area.

Buffet style shabu Sai , Wife selection available. Yet at times when I visited there's only minced beef instead of pork minced meat. Would be great is both is available for selection as I don't take beef at all. Not much choices many vegetable but the soup itself taste the best after a period of boiling with meats!

Lunch is cheaper than dinner, free flow of meat with good variety of sides. Time limit applies, 70 mins for lunch and 90 mins for dinner. Always have new soup bases to choose from. Been a regular for sometime now. I won't recommend paying for the upgrade for Wagyu beef as it's not that great

As it is an all you can eat, I did not expect the service to be good and it is consistent with my assumption. I was taking a short moment to decide on the soup based as a first time visit and the waiter was not patient at all and walked away immediately. However, they do come very quickly to retrieve the meat tray once it has been emptied.I must make it clear that the hygiene of the place is not as nice as the picture shows, as soon as you take a place from the supposedly clean stack you'll feel that grease is still clinging to the back of the plate, it makes me wonder how well they dealt with the ingredients. Luckily everything will eventually be cooked at 100'c. Phew...Food wise, the variety is okay, the plus point is that they served a few types of sushi as well as the normal sauce station, veg station and drinks station (you need to top up around S$2 per pax for free flow of drinks).My major concern here is the size of the pot. Since you were only given 90minutes to dine, the idea of having a small pot really isn't the best. 1) As the soup gets boiled, the two selections of soup based merged and became one. 2) I cannot add items that requires longer cook time in first while cooking the beef etc. as the soup just keep spilling as I cooked and the beef cannot move around in the pot. 3) it became a race and constant balance of the power of heat and soup level instead of the enjoyment. 4) and on top of all that, you're rushing through to finish within 90 mins. ...As usual, with the lack of ventilation, you'll smell like the broth when you walked out of the place.Ice cream was good but after the battle of watch the level of the broth in the pot I was a bit tired of doing self serviced. Management: bigger pots pleas

Was looking for a place to have family dinner after we did our cycle and run exercise routine over the weekend. Just wanted to have a meal with more meats and little carbs! Decided to give this place a try event though it was in Orchard Central (we know the car park was challenging driving up and its difficult to navigate within the mall too - but its ok).Found the place quite easily on level 8. Did not make any reservations and just walked in. It was also the Primary School Leaving Exams period so we thought it would also be more quite. Got our table for 5 without problems. The place is very spacious. Well ventilated, open concept. They had the standard buffet fare of vegetables and meats (chicken, pork and beef). The other items included some Japanese maki,. The 5 of us shared a hotpot with 2 compartments for different broth. Usual routine is to take walks to get your food and condiments/sauces. Meats will be served to the table upon order/request. Oh yes, the waiter said we needed to finish our meal within 90 mins - so we set our mobile timer to countdown from 90 mins. What it we were still around after 90 mins? don't know. We were there around 745pm and guess our table can't be turned around for guest at 915pm when the restaurant's closing time is 10pm...?! One day we must really try and test it out.Overall the food was fresh. Service staff as friendly and prompt. No pressure for us to order drinks or ice cream (as there is an additional charges for these). We just took the basic dinner food buffet. The good thing was the very spacious and high ceiling and air-con/ventilation - we left the place after dinner with no significant food smell on our clothes...at end end, we had a nice family meal and then headed for the car park for a spiral drive down from level 6 (we parked at 6th) to street level:

This is an all-you-can-eat shabu shabu place but only the meats you order, everything else such as vegetables, rice, drinks, ice cream, sauces, you go out and get yourself.It is S$25 per person for dinner with unlimited drinks and ice cream at S$2 extra. Wagyu beef and nice seafood also extra.Anyone who enjoys hotpot would like this, especially those who are big meat eaters. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the standard beef that was included in the standard package as quite often, these kinds of eateries offer not so nice beef so you are tempted into upgrading to wagyu. There is a good variety of soup bases to choose from and the waiters come qucikly when you order more so that's always good for a time-restricted (90 minutes) all-you-can-eat.Shabu Sai is one of those places where you will have a jolly good time if you care more about the friends / company at dinner than the food itself. To me this place is great for hniversity friends get together, or a bunch of lads before watching football. Young couples too, I think

This is a regular hangout place for us. The food is plentiful, with a large array of fresh raw food to be dunked in your hot pot.The meats (chicken, pork, beef) are sliced finely and delivered to the table as you order to ensure freshness. We love the beef, and tend to have loads and loads of it. I also like that they do not try to anticipate your sauces, instead having all the possible condiments displayed for you to add as per your desire.Recommended soups:Tonkatsu (pork bone)Yuzu (if you like sour)Tom yam (if you like mildly oily and spicy and sour)Recommended things to dunk in your soup:Beef! Minced meat sticksMushrooms (as you like

On the eighth floor of Orchard Central, Shabu Sai offers a good sized variety to pack in in 90 minutes. There are at least six soup bases and four types of meat (including wagyu beef) to choose from. And, you can top up $1.99 for free flow drink and dessert. Good food, no waiting. Yay

A great place to dine in for 90 minute for hotpot buffet that come with beef, pork, chicken shabu, seafood and various vegetable. Choice of 2 soup base that u can choose for a pot. DIY source to suit your taste buds.
4
Eat till you full buffet. Meat and vegetables and other items are fresh. After meal can have ice cream. Just that quite stressed to eat within the given time.
5
Quite a good place for buffet as it is worth the money. Would definitely go again to have it as the soup stock is worth it.

Food and idea is vary nice but the staff shoud explain how it work. I enjoy the food but cud be more nice if they will say how to cook.

The restaurant was suitable for reunion dinner with my physically challenged mother and sister. The variety of vegetables, meat and desserts was good value for money. Free flow of drinks was extra but still good which includes soft ice-cream. The restaurant located on 8th floor of Orchard Central was easily accessible. Valet parking was available. Recommended for families and friends get-together.

Went there for lunch on 19 January 2017, reached there at 11:32am, a female staff told us to wait for another 5minutes for restaurant to open, while signage indicates clearly it opens at 11:30hrs.After sat down, she told us that lunch buffet is limited to 70 minutes, same time she put a note with '12:45pm' as ending time on our table. I told her that when we got in was already 11:40am and steamboat was not even set up yet. She answered in a harsh tone, 'very fast what..' soup base wasn't even boiled until 11:55am! Well, intentially cheating? When bill came, additional drink charges were imposed, I had to approach another staff to rectify it. Food wise, certain items, eg: babycorns are stable, topping of soup base was extremely salty.Definitely won't go there again

After returning from Japan for about a week, kind of missing some good Japanese food and shabu shabu is one of them.Decided to visit this value for money destination for shabu. This was not our first time visiting this place and the restaurant had maintained its standard. This soup base of the month Is tonkatsu laksa. Tried it but don't really enjoy it. Should simply go with the yuzu and sukiyaki.Good place for value shabu shabu!
4
Whenever I have craving for shabu shabu, this place always appears in my mind. They have a variety of soup base for one to choose from. Personally I love the sukiyaki, tonkatsu and yuzu soup base.Good meats to choose from as well. The lunch time buffet gives the best value at only $14.99 per pax
5
We had a very nice buffet dinner in this place. We opted for the sukiyaki and the tomyum soup. There are a lot of choices to choose from inclucinh maki. Dessert and drinks would have additional charges. The soups were great! We left this place with full stomach

Went to shabu sai with colleagues.The staff never informed that the water is free, thus we took the upgraded package.The meats were quite a lot, though sometimes it's a bit too fatty (more to belly part).The soup is not fantastic.You must add the chilli to make it pallatable.As for the sushi and sashimi section. It's all full of carbo, and the salmon meat is not that fresh.If you are a meat eater, Shabu Sai is a good choice, but not for the taste

This outlet in orchard central is better than suntec. More spacious and has more variety of ingredients. Always go to shabu sai whenever i go to singapore. Back in home haven't found tasty japanese shabu like shabu sai.

It was dinner time . Allotment for partaking the buffet is 90 minutes. Sushi maki serve as appetizers. Plated trays with thin slices of beef pork and chicken are laid out , and you can ask for more if you want to. Hot pot consist of both miso and sukiyaki soup . It was fairly good . For a few dollars more , have unlimited drinks , coffee/tea and soft serve ice cream . Good for couples friends and family . What a find in Orchard Central

Orchard central is a shopping complex above Somerset MRT. Most visitors are unaware of the floors of restaurants upstairs. This on on level 8 is worth a visit. It offers a buffet shabu shabu dining experience at a reasonable $30 per person. This included unlimited meat and vegetables plus drinks and sushi (limited). Great staff will help you on your visit .

Highly recommended Shabu Sai at The Central.The steamboat soup was splendid especially the collagen based soup. The steamboat spread was awesome with lot of vegetables. I like the shiitakes mushroom.The restaurant comes with a high ceiling and a good view of the Clark quay river.The only downside is the weekend prices where it costs twice as much as the lunch. This may be a drawback for family or group of friends

This was our first hot pot experience, we didn't know what to expect. The staff was very friendly and showed us what to do. The meat was nicely cut and fresh, same with all the vegetables. We were so full that we didn't even had a chance to eat dessert!! Highly recommended

Shabu Sai, an authentic Japanese restaurant that serves all-you-can-eat Shabu-Shabu and Sukiyaki buffet,This place is for foodies who plan for it like the way we would plan a military deliberate attack to capture an objective on the hill. First we start with gathering of intelligence.. This restaurant allows the diner 90 minutes for a set price. The best value and time is at 11am on a weekday. We are the first in the queue and the attendant brings us to the table and start the fire for the hot pot. The timing starts when the attendent brings us the beef or pork. (There is a 5 min delay from the order of the meat to arrival.) We love their beef and order 8 trays of beef for a start. We stay off the carbohydrates (rice, noodles, potatoes etc) Select plenty of vegetables and mushrooms. The joy is in the cooking of the beef and the pork (some like chicken) with the vegetables (corn, lettuce, enoki and button mushrooms). The attendants are trained to offer us the seasonal specials for an additional price.. We politely decline. We have a plan to eat steadily over 2 rounds of meats followed dessert(icecream) and coffee/tea. At the end of our lunch we only used up 70 mins. We had a full and satisfying meal, not too heavy but enough.. Wonderful food with wonderful friends.. this is what this experience is all about. enjo

Yes, for those who like to eat a variety of meat - beef, chicken and pork. This is a place for us! Literally free flow if you could stomach it. The meat is skillfully cut into thin and fine slice and its aesthetic appeal just intrigued me to eat more of them. They are presented in tray with about 6-8 pieces inside.The buffet also has its spread of sushi though limited, vegetables, noodles, soup and ice cream!They also provide a good range of beverage for your consumption. It is pretty crowded and you should feel that the trip down here is worth your time and money. It is a good place for couple and big group for a makan fellowship.

For a buffet, the food Shabu Sai offers is actually not bad. You get to select from a variety of meat (pork, beef, chicken), soup bases (e.g. tom yam, tonkotsu), vegetables, noodles (e.g. udon, ramen) as well as miscellaneous food items such as seafood, mushrooms and eggs. There is even an ice-cream corner where you can scoop the flavour you want and garnish it with toppings.For just $1 extra, you also get a refillable supply of drinks which you can help yourself too at the drinks corner.For a Japanese restaurant, though, the sushi is really horrible. It was not fresh at all and did not taste good. The service was not bad, and the staff attended to our requests pretty quickly and with a smile

We went for lunch at Shabu Sai and loved it. The ingredients were fresh and the variety good for the price. The staff was also very helpful for us first timers at a Japanese hot pot and the waitress made a nice spice mix for me. We got the Wagyu beef at an extra price and felt it was well worth it. There is a time limit, but we easily had enough to eat within it and the staff did not even mention it
3
The food doesn't really come quickly, during peak hours the staff can be overwhelmed, and I do advise cooking your food thoroughly before eating.

The signs stated that the close at 10:30, they chased us out before 10pm. The staff were rude and unhelpful.
The soup base was nothing special and the choice of food, terribly limited.
I would never patronize them again.

It was a chilly evening because it rained the entire day, so when I met up with *Helen for dinner in town, we decided to go for Shabu Sai, for some Japanese hotpot that serves shabu-shabu and sukiyaki.There were cooked food, mainly assortments of sushi and rolls. At SGD$24.99 per adult on a weekday night and SGD$29.99 on a weekend night, this shabu-shabu hotpot buffet concept was very worth it. The only catch was that upon entry, they informed that there was a time limit of one-and-a-half hours, meaning, you were supposed to wolf down your hotpot buffet dinner within an hour and a half.We grabbed an assortment of mushrooms, vegetables, eggs, seafood and sushi back for cooking and consumption. The set itself consisted of three different types of meat - pork, chicken and beef. For each table, we could choose 2 soup base, and we chose Spicy for one, and Tonkotsu (pork bone) for the other. The soup was good and the vegetables were fresh. The meat was tender; I was already full but just had to eat more of the really succulent strips of beef.Finally, time for some palate-cooling dessert. The soft-served ice-cream came in vanilla flavour only, and there was hot fudge sauce, rainbow chips, raisins etc to add on. It was not bad - not too sweet, but lovely enough to make for a nice, simple dessert.For full review and more detailed information, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2015/06/dinner-at-shabu-sai-orchard-central.htm

We went and give it a try cause their lunch is $19.99++ for weekend lunch and $1.99 for free flow drinks and ice cream. Prices are relatively cheap but quality of food was not impressive...The spicy soup base was ok, but towards the end was very salty thus losing the spiciness. Ingredients for hot pot are pretty standard- beef, chicken, pork, vegetable, mushrooms, fish ball etc. there is white rice to go with the hot pot as well. Free flow of soft serve ice cream with some condiments. Also a selection of sauce to go with meat.Overall food is ok if you wanna give it a try but I might not be back for more

Visited on 7thMay2015 w friends. It is located at level 8 of Orchard Central,there is lifts on its right,or if take escalator were had to pass by Kiseki Japanese Buffet restaurant n another japanese there reached. This outlets seems bigger than Causeway Point. We took the normal meat range - chicken,pork n beef so is $24.99+$1.99-free flow of drinks+10%service charge n 7%GST. So total is $95.30 for 3 persons. It never told us our limited timing till when as it is 90mins for dinner,might be last night,the restaurant was not that crowded but 99% occupied.This outlet has included sushi which Causeway Point.We tried the seaweed-bland(plain water)just add 4pcs of seaweed n seafood soup base. We choose pork n chicken,we got 4 trays - slices chicken n 4 trays of slices of pork. Sushi,just normal taste but all the vegetables n sushi replenished consistently. Whole night juz saw 2 Indian staff serving guests. Receipt shown name-Sutha,he is courteous along no matter is directing us to our table nor explaining the different soup base n billing w us. Overall,service is ok but find that the price compared to Causeway Point here will be a bit expensive as added the sushi n it doesn't include seafood for this price

We decided to try out the dinner buffet after seeing the nice display in front of the shop. Although the place was nice, clean and spacious, we found the buffet to be pricey and not really worth the money. The buffet only included chicken, pork, beef and vegetables. Seafood was not included, and we have to pay extra for that. Given the price of the buffet, we would have expected fish, prawns and squid to be included. For the equivalent amount of money we spent, we could have had a better steamboat elsewhere

Had the buffet lunch at Shabu Sai Orchard Central outlet.The service staff was friendly and explained the menu to us.Buffet is at $16.99++ and add-on $1.99++ to include free flow of drink (hot/cold) and ice-cream.We were given a choice of 2 soup bases ( sukiyaki and seafood) from the 7 available.Waitress suggested we try all the 3 meat types, chicken, beef and pork.We were served 2 trays of each meat type; the meat were thinly sliced.The buffet spread was a bit disappointing, not much of a variety.The egg sushi seemed to have been produced ‘en masse’, (made in a tray and sliced into pieces)?The yellowish substance on top of the rice was supposed to be egg, but tasted powdery and wierd.Vanilla ice cream from the dispenser was not creamy enough for my taste. Available toppings of chocolate sauce, strawberry sauce, corn flakes.It is rather stressful to be allocated 70 minutes to complete the meal, definitely not a place to catch up with friends over lunch.At $45 net for 2 persons is definitely not worth it. I do not think I will come back here for another meal

Wanted to try this restaurant as I always see crowd whenever I passed by. However I am disappointed after having my lunch there. Both the soup base was not impressive, the meat selection was also limited to beef, pork and chicken. What I like is the good spread of vegetables
3
I paid $22.50 for their lunch. They do not have a lot of food choices to chose. I ordered Spicy soup and sukiyaki soup base, would recommend sukiyaki soup base rather than Spicy soup. Spicy soup taste is like adding chili into normal boiling water, feel kind of cheated. Sukiyaki soup base is sweet and taste like normal sukiyaki hotpot in other jap restaurant. Would recommend this place for diners looking for cheap and process food lovers.
