Cozy place for quiet lunch.
Cold snow crab was fresh, juicy, sweet & oceanic!
Sauce for the unagi goes really well with the rice!

Went for lunch on a Saturday. Quite packed even though it was already 1.30pm.
Ordered the grilled saba bento set ($12). Saba was sweet and soft, the chawanmushi was very good with fresh ingredients (crab meat).
Value for money.

fresh Jap food, always satisfying. Great work lunch place. Remember to come early before 1230pm or they sell out on weekdays.

My son and I ordered the Bento box which apparently is limited to 10 per day. This was the best value for money. At $12 per box, we were given a piece of grilled Saba fish, two pieces of salmon sashimi, a chawanmushi, rice, miso soup and a piece of fruit. The food was excellent

Frequent diner at Hokkaido Fish Market for their Chirashi Don set. They serve the don with 3 different kinds of fish and tamago done with unagi wrapped within it. The set comes with a miso soup, green tea and also chawanmushi. The seafood is very fresh and the chawanmushi is very good! Advisable for office people to arrive before 12nn for lunch as the crowd can be overwhelming. Also, bento sets might be sold out even at 12nn

The sushi is very fresh and tasty. The selection is very small though, when I was there for lunch they only had tuna, crab stick and cucumber. It is no frills sushi, but the tuna chunks were quite big and really yummy. Thought the price was ok. Would definitely buy again, but wish for more options

I must first say that the food here is so so - not bad, but not good enough for me to return. The set up is a little tight and there are no baby friendly chairs.The 3 in my party ordered a chirashi set each. The chirashi set was fresh but a bit too little for the price - not value for money. The only good thing was the bowl and the chopsticks which looked good, though the food presentation wasn't particularly pleasing.It will be better eating at Teppei

Price slightly higher but there is not gst and svs charge so overall still ok. As you can see from the menu, the set unagi is @ $16. Comes with 3 pieces of sashimi. The rice is very nice as they topped with some of the seasonings that made it very fragrance. I think sashimi set will be more worth. Will go again

I bought sushi set and chuka kurage today @ 6.30p.m. June 11,2015. All staffs are friendly and helpful. This restaurant located in Square 2 on 4th floor opposite from NTUC FAIR PRICE. The quality of my sushi is OK. They mixed normal rice and Japanese rice and also no mirin in it though. The Salmon on sushi is fresh and sweet and marinade jellyfish was full of flavor which is good. TripAdvisor still have bugs on application. I uploaded pics on my several reviews and it never shows up. I have to do it again from my computer. So, I will upload my pictures later.

A friend recommended me to this small eating place tucked in a corner beside the food court of Square 2.Other than a few tables for dine in, they have ready packed sushi, maki and sashimi for takeaway. If you wish to buy the takeaway pack and eat at the restaurant, they will also serve you tea.Other than the usual set lunch, they will have special menu on different days.The set lunch comes with rice, miso soup and tea. I had the cod fish set, which was good. The sashimi from the sashimi set was fresh and thick.Overall, a value for money lunch
