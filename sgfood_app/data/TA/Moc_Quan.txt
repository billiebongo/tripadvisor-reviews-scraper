If you know what really good Vietnamese food is then you’ll love eating here. It may not have a river frontage but the food is excellent. I’m so please I found this restaurant ...I want to come back tomorrow!

Had lunch here with a friend. We shared the fresh spring rolls, which were very good. Had a pork noodle dish that was excellent - very tasty, very filling! The lime soda is very refreshing! Good service. Good prices.

Although the place is small but food is amazing. The best Banh Mi I have eaten.
The service takes around 30 minutes to bring food but it is worth the taste.
Must try

Compared to many other "authentic" Vietnamese restaurants in singapore I believe this restaurant serves up the most authentic food of them all.Their soup is fantastic and their freshly squeezed orange juice is wort the visit alone!It's a great place to have lunch, a bit away from the busy streets of Singapore. Their service isn't smiling until you start talking to them but the food says everything.It's one of my favorite lunch places in singapore outside the food courts

This place is just awesome. A small restaurant inside UE square mall. The banh mi is really delicious. The bread of the sandwich is very fresh just like the filling inside.The best is the coffee they serve there. Really authentic and a must try. Banh mi cost around 10-15$ And coffee around 5$ They also have a lunch set that comes with rice paper roll which is more economic choice

The market for Vietnamese food has been growing in Singapore as more Singaporeans have become better traveled to Vietnam, and to Australia or Canada where there is excellent Vietnamese food to be had. Where once restaurants could pass off average Vietnamese food, that's not true nowadays - and unfortunately Moc Quan falls into the average category.My wife had the pho bo (beef pho) which she said was average as the soup was not tasty and beefy enough. The beef was also overcooked and thus hard to chew. My kids too proclaimed that Mrs Pho's soup was tastier. My younger daughter, an aficionado of everything spring-rolly declared that she like the spring rolls here!The great thing about Moc Quan is that it has a small section catering to vegetarians so I ordered the vegetarian banh xeo which is like a large crepe folded in half over mushrooms, beansprouts and other vegetables. I've never had a vegetarian banh xeo before so I thought that this was a really good rendition. If we can't be bothered to drive all the way to Beach Road or Rangoon Road for Mrs Pho (or even further to Joo Chiat for Long Phung), then we may come to Moc Quan again

We came here for lunch based on reviews that this place serves authentic and reasonably priced Vietnamese food. I ordered the raw beef pho, S$11.50 ++ / bowl (reasonable??? - i think not, but maybe so for others) - beef slices were lean (which is a plus) but pho (rice noodles) were soggy (no longer translucent) and thick; and the broth was weak. We also tried the brisket (the fat on the beef were yellow in color - maybe no longer fresh?) and the chicken (strips - quite expensive at more than $11) pho broth.I really want to score my lunch 2.5 stars, 3 for average and minus half a star for not serving water - but can only choose 2 or 3.To be fair, I actually came for their banh mi (maybe those are better?) but they had none that day we went. If this were their strong offering, it is surprising it is not more readily available.Given the 3 disappointments, I am not likely to visit again

We tried this restaurant for a few reasons, food for the champagne bar across the mall came from here and it was busy with locals as well as close. We were not disappointed with our food, the highlight for me being the Vietnamese mango given for me to try although it wasn't available at the time on the menu. The waitress realized I loved this fruit and gave it to me from her supply she got in a recent visit home. It was a much appreciated special touch.The surroundings are a bit cluttered but the service is friendly and efficient and the food is good value for money

Food was authentic and delicious, portion size a little small. Ice Vietnamese coffee was so far the best in Singapore that I had tasted, the strongest but yet still not as good as the one in Vietnam itself.Service is crazy slow, had a 30 mins wait for a banh mi and a bowl of noodles. Tables after us were served first unsure why. Price is affordable but not very cheap. Overall a nice meal but too long waiting time

Moc Quan has the most authentic and delicious Viet Food in town. The family is from the South of Vietnam so their cooking is very Southern. Go for the BBQ Pork Chop rice!

Excellent authentic Vietnamese food. Great taste, quick service, relaxed casual meal. Seating inside and out, although quite warm for people not used to Singapore humidity outside. Loved the food, it has become a regular spot for family members.

This is by far the best Vietnamese restaurant I have been to. I was brought here by some friends for lunch, after a strong recommendation, I had M8 (with extra meat) and it was delicious. The meat was perfectly cooked, the sauce was exactly as spicy as I expected and the whole dish was full of flavour. More importantly, the last bite was as good as the first because the dish was so well balanced. We topped it all off with iced Vietnamese coffees which were brilliantly tasty and refreshing. this was the perfect lunchbreak for me. Highly recommended

Had dinner here with (6) friends and really enjoyed the food.Coming from Sydney, authentic food is everywhere and something I missed is good Vietnamese food.Eventhough there's a number of chain Viet restaurants, I found they're not very authentic.So when we came here and had dinner, the food was exceptional.I had a sweet and sour soup with vermicelli, which was just like the ones I have back home. It was good!! A little less on the vermicelli front though.My friend had the banh mi, which they had a variety to choose from. He's was bbq pork filling and other herbs etc. That was soo tasty!! Bread is baked there, so they advised. All up we had 3 entrees, rice paper wrap and deep fried spring roll, 6 mains & 6 drinks. All totalled $S200. Which is really expensive for Viet food. However, was satisfying :

Been there the first time yesterday and the food was excellent - far better and more varied than any other Vietnamese restaurant I have been to in town. Friendly attentive waiters.The downside was that they offered some Happy Hour deal on Saigon Beer 1-1 but when I paid the bill I had to pay for all of the 4 beers we had. When asked about the Happy Hour the excuse was "On Sundays happy hour started later" but they didnt know at what time and just tried to palm it off.I had a cab waiting so couldn't discuss further but I believe I have been cheated so I recommend you confirm their offers before placing the order

1st visit. Had lunch. Chose 1xpho and 1xbaguette selection. Sliced beef pho was tasty. Quite a lot of beef slices. Broth good but I prefer broth to be 'thicker' to give deeper taste. Baguette BBQ pork was crispy, tasty and abt a foot long. Jasine and lotus tea was fragrant and pot is sufficient for 2 pax.Aircon space small so most customers choose al fresco seating overlooking the street. Free wifi but have to ask staff for password. Nice place for reasonable priced meals

I suppose when you arrive at a restaurant and the first thing you notice is a dog lying inside - it's a sign. After reading on Honeycombers that this is really authentic I thought I'll give it a try. Inside its minus 3 degrees and windy so I opted for the outdoor seating. Ordered the spring rolls which I normally love. The supposedly FRESH MADE were rock hard on each end with the rice paper totally dried out. 3/10 for taste. Then ordered the sliced beef pho - the beef was like eating a pair of old boots. The accompanying sauces very average. Went to pay the bill and found the dog enjoying his lunch in the tiny bar area. At least the dog was nice until he started barking at the delivery man! Interior decor is thrown together cheaply and outdoors is like a storage room for the cleaning equipment. I won't be going back ever. Sorry.

Read several reviews which claimed that the food was authentic, so went there for dinner. We ordered the fresh spring rolls which were very delicious, we particularly liked the sauce that accompanied this starter, as it is very different from the usual served in the other Viet establishments. The 2 main courses had generous portions, my friend ordered the beef stew with noodle soup which he finished with gusto. I ordered the dry pork noodle but found the pork which was fried to be rather tough to digest.Credit must be given to the lady at the counter, as she had great PR, and was both pleasant and efficient

Vegetarian Vietnamese options are pretty hard to find in Singapore and it was so exciting to see an entire page of veggie options here. I had a mixed Banh Mi (Tofu & Mushrooms) - the portion appears to be rather large but I went through it easily! The Baguette was light and crusty, the sauce flavourful, and the Tofu & mushrooms were juicy and done really well. This' a great spot for some great tasting food - I'll definitely go back to try the Pho

I work nearby and sometimes dine here for lunch with my colleagues. I've visited this place at least four times over the past year. The food has been consistently excellent across all my visits. Go for the pho and other noodle dishes (between $9-15) and you will not be disappointed. It's a quaint and cosy place to have a relaxed meal in. Service is a little slow, so be prepared to chat with your dining partners and wait (it's worth the wait though!) It's also never crowded but don't let that deter you. The dishes are as good as long phung's in Joo Chiat even though moc quan's menu lacks the variety of the former's. Highly recommend for those who work or live in the area.

Good Vietnamese food - enjoyed the Pho and fresh vegetarian spring rolls. Very relaxed setting for very casual dining. Friendly service. Reasonably priced for Singapore / the location.

Small cafe is not UE Square. Simple but tasty food. Have monthly specials with street food type as the main fare. Well worth a visit.

Great friendly service and large variety of Vietnamese foods. Price match location but nonetheless a good deal compared to other restaurants in the area. Offers an outdoor space which is particularly nice in the evenings. Food is original and yummy. My favorites are the Pho and Banh Mi and rice spring rolls

Moc Quan is my neighbourhood Vietnamese restaurant. Coming from Melbourne I've been spoilt with delicious Vietnamese Banh Mi and Phó for many years. The quality in Singapore is generally fairly poor for Vietnamese so it's a pleasure that we have Moc Quan nearby. The Pho and bún is constantly good and their other dishes such as the Viet beef stew are good. The banh mi aren't traditional but are some of the better in town. All washed down with a few Saigons makes for a lovely dinner. The staff are friendly and the big lab keeps an eye on everyone, top place

I was introduced to this restaurant 3 weeks ago by a good Friend. She knew I love coffee and Vietnamese food and she highly recommended this place. The food was really good and fresh. We had beef spring roll and pho chicken. Ended lunch with their famous coffee. What can I say, the food was so good, I decided to visit this place again for dinner tonight. This time I brought my Husband along. He agreed the food was good. If you are a fan of Vietnamese food, this is the place to satisfy your hunger!!

Just a simple Vietnamese cuisine cafe located in UE Square. Can't be compared to what you get in HCM. Decent serving for the price.Quality not very consistent; sometimes the beef pho soup gets a little bland. The fried spring rolls are kids favorite. Personally I like the dry pork noodles
1
I craved banh mi and pho, which I had every 2nd day in Sydney recently, so I googled "best banh mi". After reading a favorable review from Daniel Food diary, I packed the kids, hubby and helper into the car and we headed to UE mall for a promising taste of Vietnam.Oh, the disappointment as I took my first bite of the super dry bread and the very skimpy fillings. I could barely taste the pate and ham. Such a let down.The sliced beef pho was average with the meat being so tough I could not eat it.Pork chop and chicken on rice was not so tasty either.As cute as the dog was I don't think it was appropriate to have an animal inside a Restsurant. It looks like I have to wait for my next trip to Australia or a holiday to Vietnam to eat some yummy Viet food

Wondered into this place for a light bite, and shared a belly pork Banh mi with my partner. Oh my god. I wish I'd ordered my own because it was absolutely delicious. So tasty, crunchy, sweet, sour, savoury and spicy all at the same time.. All the whole tasting fresh (fresh herbs and freshly cooked bread - I later learned they import their flour especially from Vietnam) it was a mouthwatering experience in a bun. Bravo. I'll definitely be coming back to try more items whilst I'm on holiday here.

We stopped here one evening for a meal after visiting a bar near the UE Square shopping mall. The menu looked enticing and the prices were favourably inexpensive.The waiter was pleasant and spoke English and gave us information on what the various dishes contained. The service was OK, but not exceptional, and we had a reasonable meal at a good price
