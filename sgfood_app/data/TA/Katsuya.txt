That's a real and authentic Japanese restaurant! A good surprise! I recomend! (Precision: don't expect find sushis or maki, just sashimi)

Had maguro sashimi and lamb katsu. Excellent! Sashimi was really fresh and served at the right temperature with real fresh wasabi.
Lamb katsu was tender on the inside and fluffy on the outside. Not oily at all!

I would rate No 1 Katsu in Singapore! It is very delicious... Dory is also fantastic. We always order Katsuya fu that comes Dory, Prawn, Oyster and Katsu. Everything is crispy and nice. Their service is also excellent.

The katsu set is very delicious, crispy outside and juicy inside.
Japan Tokyo standard.
The service also excellent, fast and attentive.

So far this place is the best tonkatsu restaurant for me to serve authentic tonkatsu restaurant in Singapore. Fresh, crunchy deep fried pork and akadashi miso soup can't be found anywhere but here.

If you are looking for a really good pork Tonkatsu, this restaurant certainly is a hidden gem right here along East Coast road! Do not be fooled by the lack of crowd and queues, people might be put off by the higher prices. The pork slices are fried with a really crispy batter and not oily at all. We tried the platter for 2, which includes pork, dory fish, 1 jumbo prawn and 2 oysters! The dory fish is one of the best I ever tried. For the pork Tonkatsu, it comes in 2 selections - Rosa (with fats) and Hire (lean meat and juicy). The portion is generous and the waitress will top up the cabbage. Even the miso soup that comes with the set is good. Very nice Japanese restaurant ambience along a very crowded road. You have to try to believe! :-

Had tonkatsu at Saboten and Ma Maison. Wanted to find out how Katsuya tastes like.To be honest, Katsuya is just about the same as Sab and Ma. Good quality cuts with crispy outside and succulent insides.This is where you would go if you want to steer clear from mall crowds. Katsuya is small and intimate. Perfect for the quiet evening to enjoy food that you love. Pricing is comparable to all other tonkatsu places. Affordable, although mid-range

Just have to go back specially for this in Jan 2017 during one of the weekends. Just can't forget the taste it left during the first visit. Luckily, we were there before the dinner crowd starts to come in if not we were not sure how long we will have to wait then because usually you will have to make a reservation on weekends. Other than that, please take note that you have to wait for quite some time before your food is served but it's worth the wait.

I have been to Tonkichi and Saboten before having the Tonkatsu today with my experience with Saboten just 2 weeks' ago. I find that my meal today is a pleasant one not only in terms of ambience but food as well.I ordered the mixed seafood set while my dinner partner ordered the Hire set (fatless). We shared both sets with Onikoroshi sake added to the meal along with some curry gravy.I must say that in terms of crispiness, the tonkatsu matches that of Tonkichi while the hire set which is actually tenderloin was both juicy and tender. The seafood set consists of a big piece of prawn, a generous piece of dory fish (sliced) and oyster. I can taste the freshness of the seafood and the prawn is pretty chewy which to me signals freshness through the deep fry. While the sesame seed sauce is stronger than Saboten, I prefer the sauce here as i do not need to pour too much of it and it goes well with the cabbage which in case you are not aware, it is refillable if you order the set meal.I like the service as I ordered onikoroshi sake which the waitress politely remind me that it is very dry. I find the dryness palatable and taste strong but decent for the meal. For a person who dislikes dryness in alcohol, this sake cuts nicely with the Tonkatsu. The meal ended nicely with some sliced oranges and contrary to many Japanese places which serves watermelon, it is something different and they taste sweet.It is not very crowded on a Thursday night and as i leave the restaurant by sliding the door close, I caught a glimpse of the chef looking at me. With a nod of his head to signal a thanks through glass walls of the open concept kitchen, I ended a wonderful meal for the night

Small yet comfortable restaurant run by the chef and his wife. The deep fried pork cutlet is very crispy and yet not oily. The meat remains juicy and tender. The chef cum owner said it is because of the type of oil used. My favorites are their Rosu and Kaki. I loved their curry too
