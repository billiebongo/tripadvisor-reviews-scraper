Tasty and healthy food, great coffee. All the menu is gluten-free, also a lot of the options in the menu are diary free as well. Keep up the good work, guys!! Waffles are a must try!

Tiann's is 100% gluten free so was a godsend for a coeliac. The staff told us everything is made on site. We came in the afternoon to grab some cake but ended up dining in for 2 scoops of ice cream as well, one of which has great gf cookies in it! We bought some small pieces of cake to take away. We had the tea cake and marble cake, both moist, dense and not in any way crumbly. We found the chocolate part of the marble cake too bitter and strong for our taste. Prices for were not too bad to ensure for tasty gluten free products without cross contamination. Keen to return again

Being a GF family we tried this place for brekkie. The waffles were amazing as was the walnut and date bread with avocado and feta. So good we returned for lunch!! The kids loved it and do did we. A must try for any coeliac travelling to singapore and four anyone else who wants delicious food.

Heard about this place as having an entirely gluten free menu. Cycled there this morning for breakfast. Had scrambled eggs sausages and brown rice toasted bread with a really delicious tomato chutney. Having cycled there I justified trying there signature chocolate and hazelnut cake. Terrific. They are clearly passionate about GF and sustainability. Really friendly as well. Given how much I ate I really should have taken a very indirect route home.Will be back to try other items- waffles looked good

These are the best waffles we have ever had! Even while eating gluten... you would never know they were gluten free - what ever kind of sorcery is going on it is pure genius and kind of makes me wanna live here. Will definitely be returning here and would recommend to anyone gluten free or otherwise. Wonderful place with good ethics and friendly knowledgeable staff :

My first visit to Tiann's. It has lots going for it, but unfortunately was sadly disappointed that EVERYTHING I ate on/with was a disposable product. In good conscienceI can't return to this bakery. It goes against everything I am trying to teach my family about eating responsibly and our impact on the environment. We created so much waste in just a single meal. I can't imagine how much trash is created in a week/month/year. Although all the products are biodegradable, they are still creating an enormous amount of trash! I did enquire and was told they applied for a restaurant license but was denied. I certainly hope a change will be made and more consumers will support the idea of less waste

Oh my goodness, this cafe is a ‘Must try’. Their savoury gluten free waffles are hands down the best I have ever tried! They also do a really good almond milk latte (with home made almond milk). They offer a number of local dishes, such as Bibimbap, but they make them with gluten free. You can also choose to have white rice or quinoa with their local dishes. Also worth a mention is the fact that the use no refined sugar in any of their food or baked goods. The only slight complaint is that they are a little pricey, but I am willing to pay a bit more for the reassurance that I am eating in a % gluten and refined sugar free facility

The whole place could do with improvement : service is slow, not attentive, and the food is quite disappointing - not matching the mouth watering descriptions on the menu, and the price. I do not think it is sustainable nor nice to serve food in disposable containers, even if they are recycled : gives a fast food vibe to what's presented. All in all, the gluten free concept is good for those with intolerance, but it needs improvement to make customers happy for the money they spend & wanting to come back
