restaurant was undergoing renovation..
5
having stayed at the Hotel we wanted to try the menu at Indulge.
it's a small menu but does offer a good selection.
do try the nasi goring.. delicous
3
I had the lunch buffet at the Indulge restaurant. The environment was quiet and cosy despite the on-going upgrading work at the hotel atrium.
The buffet spread was quite limited. I was quite disappointed that the buffet did not serve ice cream and durian puddings.
4
Traditional Chinese New Year dishes which we missed much these days! Keep it going, indulge at park. We will come back for more
4
When there during the lunch hour rush, but was surprised to see many tables vacant. A nice selection of a la carte lunch was available. Prompt service and a nice place to chill.
4
Services was prompt. The hotel was under renovation but the atmosphere remained comfortable and cosy.
4
this was the restaurant for the daily breakfast for the people who were staying at the hotel. The breakfast had the same items repeated for 5 days of our visit, making us think whether they are serving the same items again and again.The staff was courteous and ambiance was good
1
Numerous restaurant staff dining "loudly" in the restaurant some seated next to me and my family and another big bunch seated right smack in the middle of the restaurant and dining and talking loudly and non chalantly!!!It was a sad day for my family and I as we had to put up with the numerous staffs gossiping and complaining about their work when we pay good $$$ to dine privately but was unfortunately greeted with this unpleasantness.I can understand that some hotels allow their staffs to dine in the restaurant but this will usually find the staff seated in a lone corner and dining quietly and quickly without disturbing the other paying patrons.However this was not the case,,,Buyer Beware!!
5
Good spread of seafood and international dishes. Fresh oysters, salmon, Boston lobsters and Alaska crab and large tiger prawns. Don't miss the chilled durian. Many many more dishes that unable to try all in one visit. Friendly staffs and service level far exceed many other 5 star hotels that I had been. Chef replenish the buffet spread almost immediately once finished. Only thing is that the hotel is under renovation and not easy to find the entrance. Must reserve table before hand as restaurant is not really very big in sitting capacity.

As it was Xmas season, there were a selection of treats like turkey, log cakes and warm Xmas plum pudding. We enjoyed the cod fish with teriyaki sauce and roast duck.The crayfish and prawns on ice were fresh and crunchy. And of course, we loved the desserts especially the chocolate cake
3
The food choices is limited.suprising the ice-cream served is melting.Overall,the food quality is average.
4
As above. Restaurant was rather empty on a weekday evening. Service was not bad too.would recommend.
4
Went for the 3 course set lunch Food was surprisingly nice! We enjoyed the dessert "Taste of coconut" the best! The chef was innovative and sincere in creating good food.
5
It was a nice place to spent a evening for a dinner even you are alone!! You can find variety of continental food items. Hospitality is awesome. People are more friendly. You can experience a quality service here.
4
We had a simple lunch fathering with colleagues. Food were simply delicious and well presented. Worth our trip down to try the food.
3
We knew that the hotel was being renovated, however the price charged and standard of room is high compared to others
4
We picked Indulge for a team's Xmas lunch as it was near to our office and with a broad buffet spread that will possibly please everyone. Indulge did not disappoint and everyone in the team is happy. Service staff is very attentive and we love the abundant choices, including some Xmas specialty

On our first visit at Indulge, I was disappointed with the food and I wrote about it here. Last night, ended up having dinner here again and this time, we were blown away! Not only was the food great, the service was fantastic! Let's talk about the food: It seemed like they updated the menu because we saw some interesting stuff that we didn't see previously. We ordered carbonara and half-chicken with rosemary with truffle fries and THEY WERE SUPER GOOD! The carbonara was a perfect blend of creamy and satisfying and I especially loved the crispy slice of bacon on top. The chicken infused with rosemary and thyme was nicely done and the meat was just the right kind of tender. We had citrus with fruits and mango ice cream for dessert and they were indeed a perfect complement to the delicious mains. As for the crew, just wow! They were very nice and attentive and you can really tell that they are passionate about their job as it shows in the way they treat their customers. Thank you, guys, for such a wonderful dining experience last night. It was so wonderful I had to write another review.:

Wanted to try Greg's seafood shack menu which has moved into the Indulge cafe and the food quality did not disappoint. Tried the broiled seafood platter with garlic butter sauce which came with 2 sides, salad and truffle fries. Best truffle fries I've had in a while. Seafood was fresh and very well cooked. Was attended to by Daniel and the rest of his service team and they gave my wife and I excellent service.

Perhaps my expectation was a little too high because I went home after dinner at Indulge with a tinge of disappointment at what I had been served. I ordered a salmon dish and my husband ordered the fish and chips Ã  la carte - and I found both to be very oily and to be honest, not really appetising. Maybe we should've tried the buffet instead for more options. The restaurant is also a bit dull. I suppose it's because the hotel itself appears to be undergoing some renovation, hence, the uninspiring look and feel
5
I had dinner here one night in January and the selection of food was outstanding. Everything was constantly refreshed. Plates were cleared quietly and quickly. And the entire staff was all smiles and more than happy to do anything to please their customers.
4
I had been to this restaurant a few times but i must say that the variety of choices was so much better compared to years ago. I am referring to its buffet lunch. Worth and value for money.
4
Stayed in Grand Park hotel last december, and breakfast.
The food was really good and they gava us like a special breakfast.
We def will come back soon !

Breakfast was part of our package when staying at the hotel. It was adequate with plenty of choices, just loved trying the asian delicacies at breakfastt time.

I had a lunch buffet here last weekend with my sister. The spread was alright, in fact small for the price at $55/pax. Seafood: Ok. there are prawns, mussels, scallops, sashimi Hot food: very boring and not good. The roasted pork and duck sit in the tray for so long, it's cold and dry. In fact we came in around 12.30pm so it shouldn't be that dry. The food is hardly replenished. At 1.30pm it's half empty and left as-is. There's only 1 beef station which is slightly more exciting than other hot food.Dessert choices are ok, some icecream, banana sweet soup. Overall atmosphere is very dull, not very enticing. Will not come back or recommend

Just attended a business lunch at the renovated cafe at Grand Park City Hall. It was a nice surprise with the creative renovation. It provides the restaurant with a nice cosy atmosphere than before. The food was as nice as the ambience. We had the truffled mushroom soup full of aroma with bites of mushrooms. Slow roast salmon and herbs roast chicken were both prepared up to fine dining quality and peresentation. The dessert was heavenly..... whole young coconut filled with coconut jelly with homemade ice cream was out of this world. I realized that the hotel has built more food joints just before I left for meeting. Surely, I will be back!

With the closing down of the Chinese Restaurant in the hotel, Indulge @ Park is the main restaurant. The ala carte set lunch and dinner are value for money and well done. The fruit salad, Black Angus beef and fish dishes are recommended. Besides the Western dishes, there are also local favourites - Hainanese Chicken Rice, etc
5
Had the set buffet,plenty of choice.The sea food was delicious and plentiful.Pick your meat and cooked by chef and brought to the table.I had bread and butter pudding and icecream for dessert very decadent.Our friend choose the beefburger meal.Enormous portion,beefburger,bun,fried egg and loads of chips.We had had a beer in bar prior to going to restaurant and as it was happy hour we had 2 for price of one.They brought second beer to restaurant from bar when we were ready,now that`s service

Stayed at this hotel for a week and had breakfast here as my room came with breakfast. Was a bit disappointed at their breakfast as I though there would be some local breakfast dishes but there wss none. They had some congee and fried noodles but the congee was too thick and noodles were not as good as one could randomly get on the street in Singapore. There were no Malay or Singapore style offerings.
4
I've stayed at Grand Park City Hall and I've tried this restaurant both for breakfast and dinner. On both occasion the service was good and the food was very nice. i was impressed by the number of choices for breakfast of both Chinese and International food
5
Special Asian food including plain/chicken porridge, hot soya milk and yuh tiao.
Variety of western food also available.
4
The food at Indulge at Park is excellent and one of the best that you could ask for in the area. The service was excellent.
5
At the Indulge at Park are very Good and fresh meals and drinks, I can choose different meals, the service is nice, all is clean, the staff is very helpul
3
The range and standard of food here is not as good as one would expect at a putative 5 star establishment . The kitchen managers should visit the swiss Hotel at Merchants Court to see how its done .
3
Limited choice of food at buffet and ala carte menu. We order tenderloin steak seems it had been storage quite long. Service average, food average.

I went there with my boyfriend for Christmas eve buffet. the seating was a bit problem at first as there were free seats but the manager insist it was reserved but we waited till 9pm but no one eventually sat there. The Christmas buffet was good with variety of Christmas cookies. cakes, chocolates and fresh oysters, scallops, prawns and crayfish. They even have a gingerbread house on display and some celebration poppers and hats for each guest. except for the glitch at giving us the reserved tables which actually no guest eventually sat there and we have to argued our way to be sorted there because we actually were the ones who resrrvedd window seat but the manager insist we didn't reserve any seats.

I went on a weekday and tried their buffet for the very first time. As I'm a regular buffet goer at different restaurants I am quite impressed with the food and service at Indulge at Park. Service is good. The restaurant manager is also friendly and very approachable. From the time you walk in, you are well attended to and greeted and shown to your table with a smile. Special mention must be given to Edward who provided exceptional service. He remember guests names, serves with passion and anticipates their needs. I like the seafood spread as they have quite a lot variety. From prawns, lobster, alaskan crab, oysters, claims, cray fish and more. The chefs are also very attentive in topping up the good regularly. There is also a bbq corner where you can send in meat and seafood for cooking. The ice cream tastes very good, I think it is gourmet ice cream. The main dishes are in general good but not excellent. Dessert station is quite complete. For the price I would say its value for money and I will come back again. Keep up the great service and food!

Attracted by the courtyard while walking past the hotel and feeling a little desperate we enquired at Indulge if they could accomodate our party of four adults and five children.They were happy for use to sit in the courtyard and we ordered some drinks. These arrive reasonably quickly and so we perused the menu and made some selections. Most of the mains were priced around S$20 and so we ordered a few different dishes including a pizza, carbonara, pancakes for the children and nasi goreng.The pancakes arrived after about 30 minutes. Followed by the nasi goreng. Shortly afterwards (about 45 minutes after we ordered) someone came out and asked what type of pasta we would like with the carbonara. About 10 minutes later someone else came and said that a particular ingredient wasn't available for the pizza. These dishes arrived at least an hour and a half after we ordered. Everyone else had ordered.We had six beers for which we were charged $17 each.None of the items on the menu included a service charge of 10% and GST of 7% which was not clear on the menu.While the food was OK and the order setting was pleasant this was not a meal worth the $267 for which we were charged. There was no apology from the apathetic staff for the extreme delays nor for the fact that each dish arrived at a different time

The breakfast buffet was part of the hotel package. The buffet spread was good. As we have 7 of us from 3 different rooms, we have requested for table near to each other. However, though the tables were unoccupied, our request was not acceded to. Dirty plates clearing was slow due to manpower shortage. My sis and brother-in-law had their lunch buffet there and the spread was excellent!

We were looking for a place to dine for dinner on a Friday night and a friend suggested this buffet restaurant that offers BBQ items in addition to their usual buffet. Its at Grand Park Hotel Hotel at City Hall, which was convenient for most of the group and we came here for dinner.The restaurant is located on the ground floor, with the buffet sections spread out across the restaurant. The sections include: - Fresh Seafood section: You get cooked Alaskan crab legs, which was later topped up with half lobster in the latter part of the buffet. - Japanese section: You get sushi, soba and somen noodles. The variety of sushi were decent and I like the somen noodles, which you normally don't get at buffet restaurants. - Live Cooking Station: They pan fry Chinese dumplings and also prepare the claypot chicken rice here.I loved the claypot chicken rice which was prepared at the live station. When you lift the claypot cover, you get a whiff of the chicken rice. The chef added soya sauce chicken to the calypot, some vegetables and heat it up. Its good. - Meats: On offer were Roast Beef, Cooked leg of Ham, Unagi, Fried items - Spring Rolls, Baked Scallops and Oysters. I liked the roast beef and baked oyster with hollandiase sauce.- Chinese Cooked Food section: Fried noodles, vegetables, seafood, tofu and lamb in stock were available.I was focusing on the other sections of the buffet, and didn't eat much from this section.- Dessert section: Good selection of desserts, with 4 choices of ice cream and variety of toppings, fondue, macarons, local desserts - nonya kueh, durian penyet (thick paste) and mini desserts in shot glasses. I especially like the mango pudding which was shaped like a Koi fish and the gold leaf pasted onto its body. I also like the Durian Penyet, which was thick and delicious. The black sesame ice cream was also good.The BBQ section is located in the courtyard, where you can pick your choice of meats and seafood and the chef will cook to order. There is marinated pork, beef, lamb, salmon, scallops and crayfish. Sweet corn is also available. After the chef has cooked your order, the serving staff will bring to your table, reliving you the hassle of waiting at the station for your food to be cooked.For the price of $62, the buffet offers good value, where you get BBQ items in addition to your usual buffet items. Try it

they have a great food at the buffet, a lot of choices and selection of dishes. Money is worth it. You will never regret dining in.

This was amazing with everything from the freshest seafood to local delicacies, to international cuisine and the array of deserts was incredibly tempting.

Good staff service polite n helpful
Great variety of international food
Can improve by providing warm plain water once customers sit on the table

I saw the 'food magazine' in the room and decided to try the CNY buffet lunch as it was only $39++ and it has beijing duck, suckling pig and alot of other festive promo food. The food is total disappointment. Food were cold and kinda tasteless. Seafood & sashimi although placed on ice but was not cold and it is quite small. We were not told that drinks were included so we only had iced water

The breakfast buffet that was included with our club room can be had upstairs in the club lounge or downstairs at "Indulge", opt for downstairs the selection is 10 times larger at Indulge.The buffet selection is huge with many Western and Asian selections available, food was hot, fresh and everything was delicious. It was a great way to fuel up for the day before heading out for the day of excursions or tours, or whatever bring you to Singapore.I am not sure what the cost would be as it was included with our room, but I think it was in the SGD$32 range and while on the expensive side for breakfast, if we had to pay we would have it was worth it.We also had the dinner buffet twice as well, for SGD$55 not inexpensive but they had a tremendous selection of dishes including shrimp, steamed lobster, and crab. Huge dessert area with dozens of selections for those with a sweet tooth.We never tried the lunch buffet as we were always out about and also did not order anything al la carte either (the buffet looked too good to pass up

Set against a waterfall backdrop, this restaurant is perfect for lazy Sunday lunches..... The seating was warm and cosy, with a table large enough to accomodate our plates and plates of sumptuous food... a big plus!The spread was good, with Continental, Asian and local specialties..... The desserts were among our favourites.... Service was prompt and polite....Overall, we had a wonderful lunch here...

The breakfast service was superb, the everything is fresh, its still warm, the quality is good. The dish ive got nothing to complain about, but there was one dish , the dish made from the poached egg, cheese on top, bread on the bottom, it was really really good, the texture of each component makes it realy good, from the top to the bottom, it was really sustainable, a very simple dish, the humble of the ingridient but taste really good. The service was good too. Good job
