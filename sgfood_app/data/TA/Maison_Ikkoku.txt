Pleasant experience. Food was decent and served pretty fast for omakase. But felt that it could have been more value for money as some of the items were pretty generic.
Nice surprise for birthday as they presented the dessert ice cream w sparklers
5
The ambience was good. We had the Omakase dinner with bespoke cocktails. The service was good and food was delicious. Overall a pleasant experience.

From the moment Instepped in we were made to feel welcome,the cocktails were exactly what we wanted just from three questions and each course was a delight

says Japanese but actually it's fusion kitchen...
the bar service is excellent, however the food quality is far away from japanese...
wagiju beef as tough as my shoe...

Just came here for Valentine’s Day dinner and I’m greatly disappointed with the service, food and seating. We had reservations for 8:30, got seated only at 9:10 pm. The service was the slowest and most unorganized. The food was definitely not worth the price, and it took 2.5 hours just to get through the courses. Not coming back here again. I was looking forward to my dinner date here but this restaurant just ruined it for me. Go here for a drink if you want but I would not recommend eating here at all.
5
I've never been to a bar where there isn't a menu for drinks. The bartender came up to us and asked us for what kind of flavours we were looking for - and he delivered exactly what we wanted. The place has got a nice little outdoor seating with the view of the Sultan Mosque in the background - that looked really nice when lit up at night.
5
TLDR: This place offers you a dining experience worth remembering for the special occasion, be it an anniversary or a birthday, for a price that doesn't blow a hole in your wallet (We spent $213+ for two person omakase experience).Would definitely return!What we liked:- The food was great at the $68 we're getting, in the form of a 12 course meal. The portion may be small for some but it's expected given the pricing, but the taste of each dish was special and a few of them were out of this world. The chefs clearly put a lot of effort into making their dish stand out- The staff was great at their service. Willing to help take pictures and checking with us on how the food is and just chit chatting. We even got a balloon for our anniversary! - Their signature bespoke cocktail, which is an experience to remember itself. The bartender/mixologist was clearly passionate in his arts, and he's able to whip out just the drink you're looking for without you going too much into specifics. Seeing him in action was a highlight in itself- The cozy environment. Dimly lit with a romantic ambiance to it, the perfect place to bring your date What could have been done better:- The $9 water that they served you at first. We came prepared knowing it thanks to earlier reviews and were prepared to pay for it, but felt that the restaurant could have at least given us the choice or absorbed the water price under the omakase price. Because knowing in advance is always better than being caught by surprisePro-tip for visiting:- The place seats at specific timing so don't come too early or too late. Reservations are a must as well, so make sure to book in advance before visiting

Wonderful place! We went for cocktails before dinner and it was truly unique experience. There is no menu and drinks are made based on your description of preferences. The drinks were amazing and each cocktail was made exactly to description! Each drink had a unique smell and taste! Everyone there was so nice and the place was very cute. Must try place!!!!

We had the Omakase set dinner at this Japanese fusion establishment in Fort Canning. Food is excellent and pretty good value at S$68 per person. It was nice and quiet as it was there late. Food was served at the bar and we sat on stools.There are no proper seats at this restaurant. The most unique aspect of the dinner was the drinks where the bartender would concoct a drink based on your preference be it spicy, fruity, dry, sweet, type of alcohol. We had a bit of difficulty finding the place initially. It’s at the Fort Canning Arts Centre and entrance is at the front by the arts centre entrance/ticket box office. Parking is at car park B just before the top of the road and before Hotel Fort Canning entrance.

Maison Ikkoku is my absolute favourite for a weekend breakfast/ brunch. Having tried a number of brunch places, I can tell you that this one is by far on of the best. Their French Toast with Berries, Eggs Benedict and iced chocolate is what I would recommend. They do really nice coffees too. I have recommended this place to a number of my friends and all of them have loved it. The place is cozy and chic. It gets busy on weekend, so recommend getting here early for breakfast, or getting a reservation in advance for brunch (you need to call before Friday night to book for Saturday or Sunday)
5
Customized dinner and cocktail. Very nice industrial chic atmosphere, deep immersion into modern japanese cuisine. Very good service!
5
great service great ambience great food great value and very friendly staff. this is a hidden gem in the city. one of the best omakase i had. will definitely visit again!

Enjoyable meal. The 12 courses were substantial. Ingredients were fresh. Creations were flavorful. However, there were the repeats in the ingredients used. Flavor profile was 2 dimensional. Nothing stood out or was memorable. But at $68 for a 12 course omakase, I'm not complaining.
4
thumbs up for Matt - the bar managerA very friendly, creative and passion in his work personI never like cocktail but after trying few cocktail he mixed.This is the place I would strongly recommend for those who "dislike / hated / had bad experience" with cocktail, tell him your preference and he will customise cocktail for you.About the food, I had the 12 course Omakase at $68++ (no harm trying once...) 1.8/

We arrived later than expected as we got lost and missed the turn into fort canning twice. When we got there, we were rushed to our seats and served the first course immediately. We had the 12 course omakase meal. Initially, we were pleased at the speed of the service. However, when the courses started to flood. 5 courses came in the span of 15 minutes. We were still eating the 2nd course while the fifth plate was being served. This is very unprofessional for a restaurant that claims to be serving an omakase meal. When we requested for the food to be served slower, the service staff told us that because we were late they had to speed up because the food was already prepared. Completely ridiculous. We finished our very unsatisfying "12 course omakase" in less than an hour and left. For 90 over dollars per head (without drinks) you could have a way better meal elsewhere with much better service. Don't bother wasting your time
1
We went to Maison Ikkoku for a cup of coffee. We already had breakfast and we just wanted coffee. After 10 minutes, they asked us to leave their place (!) because they wanted to give our table to someone who wanted to eat something! First time we face such a rude behavior anywhere! As for the quality. Coffee was OK, but nothing special. Definetely one of the most overpriced places in Singapore. A pure disappointment
5
Came a couple of times and I must say the food has never been better.The new concept of the cafe: display of art pieces coupled with soothing jazz music, made the place very intimate and cozy.The food - I tried the truffle eggs benedict, breaking dawn (their big breakfast) with their chai latte (I had 2 servings lol). It was amazing. You have to try everything on the menu!! Nothing has failed me.Most importantly, the staff are the friendliest and very approachable, almost felt like home.This place definitely have quality food, drinks and staff! Must visit
1
Came here previously and the latte and cakes were good. However major disappointment letdown this round. How could they serve us $7 cold latte and the what on earth latte art is that? Complained and was told the latte served by different people???? So where is the right person?!?!?!?! Only saving grace was the matcha tart....
5
It was an awesome funky bar to visit. My friends run this place and my dream to visit them and see it. Awesome and very friendly Italian bartender I have ever met before with creativity is beyond expectation.I highly recommend this bar to anyone who is interested in some funky place to hang out with good drinks. Comes with nice view

Read good reviews on their 12-course omakase meal and the price of $68 is much more affordable compared with most other omakase meals. The staff were very thoughtful and they checked with us if there were anything we don't eat so that they can replace the item to give us the best experience. There was a good variety in the menu, ranging from meat, seafood, veg, soup, pasta, rice and dessert! I particularly like their corn soup with whisky, interesting twist to the usual soup. FORT by Maison Ikkoku is also famous for its bespoke cocktails. Instead of the standard menu, you can tell the mixologist the taste that you would like and you'll be surprised with his creation. As it's bespoke, the price is also slightly on the high side.I would recommend this place for special occasions and do remember to make reservations as the place is quite cosy
5
Attentive service and marvellous bespoke cocktails mixed to your specific preferences made for a very enjoyable drinking experience.
5
The food is simple and yet enjoyable. Planning the next visit for Aug with more friends. The cocktails designed by the bartender is simply amazing.
5
had an omakase for my gf birthday celebration.. the food was presented very nicely and taste greatly as well
Took a lot of pic here, certainly instagram worthy spot
4
Great concept
Awesome food, go for chef's special and you will be amazed
Unique choice of wine in red and white is fine too
You will enjoy a quiet / romantic diner, but be sure to book as capacity is limited
Bon appétit
4
Restaurant is small but nice ambiance. Food portion looks small at first but it is filling as it reaches the 12th dishes. Taste of food is nice and the waiter will explain as they serve each dishes.
5
Amazing Cosy Bar and restaurant, tucked away in a little remote spot on Fort Canning.Highly recommended! Had a 12 course Omakase Meal for SG 68bucks! Had the most amazing cocktails, whiskey sour to be specific ( with spicy green and red chilli padi)Also tried several other cocktails! Superb presentation and I love the music they play here! Ken the bartender is skillful and friendly! I have since returned on 2 other occasion with some other friends! Has been consistently good
5
Always splendid service and great value for the 12-course omakase set. This quaint bar sitting restaurant is a definite must try. We have kept going back because of the wonderful service and wonderful tasking food! Great for a romantic date or a night out with friends
5
We went there for a birthday dinner and we ordered the 12 courses meal at c. 65 SGD. It was a great value for money.We also ordered two bespoke cocktails and both of us were happy with their related cocktails !I definitely recommend the place

1) My simple gin tonic dont even taste good. The tonic water is too sweet and there's too much lemon - that spoils the gin. How can one foul up a gin tonic - the most basic drink to such an extent? Very pricey drinks at $25 and upwards per drink. And I do not understand my gin tonic - a long drink cost the same as my colleagues' cocktails? It's not double shot. If a gin tonic costs $25, i will like the pleasure of pouring the bottled tonic water myself, not a standard pour from a common bar.3) The ordering of the drinks was slow as the server had to ask what our preferences so that the mixologist has enough info to make a drink. Definitely a waste of time. I understand that the price premium is worth it if the drinks was really crafted differently. However some of them common like pina colada, or earl grey gin. Asking a few questions definitely does not worth the price. Bespoke??? Right..3) The space which is air-conditioned is small and cramped. It's not good if u have a large crowd.4) I do not think i will ever go back again
5
First visited MI back in 2012/2013; It was an accidental find but wow, it has kept me going back many times since then. They used to have a pretty small sitting space but since a couple of years ago, they have revamped the interior space a little and now it's more spacious for groups. I have only tried the brunch menu, not the drinks at night. Every menu item that I have ordered has been awesome so far. But if you were to come this place for one thing, that's the coffee for sure! It serves one of the best coffees in Singapore - be it a flat white, iced americano or their signature MI latte (double shot latte) - just make sure you order a cuppa when you are here/in the area!This is definitely one of my favorite cafes in Singapore. :
5
I seldom give 5 stars but this place deserves it.
Just had a wonderful dinner with friends.
The barkeeper is from Sardinia/Italy and the owner Ethan is looking after us.
Cosy atmosphere, I like it.
Must try.
4
One of the best service I've seen in Singapore. The cappuccino is very good and the lava cake is a pleasure for the palate! I highly recommend this place of you like to enjoy some peace around Arab Street area.
5
I'm glad I decided to give Fort a try. The cocktails were great and the people there made everything even better. Great vibes. Will definitely return!
4
Thank you Adrian and Matteo for those great cocktails during my last weekend in Singapore. This little bar was packed, lucky we still can squeeze in. Service was great, they are friendly but professional. Definitely will come back again for another episode of girls night out
4
Matt the bar tender was good at hosting and customizing drinks with a wow factor like burning rosemary or safe for more Ommpah lumpah! However the omakase had some hits and misses with its courses some we like very reproducible dishes. Soup was good! Basil olive oil bisque. Wish they had a print of what was the dishes of the day just so to guide our experience. Very private place on the hill! Good for dates
5
It was an awesome night we have at Fort by Maison Ikkoku. That night was fabulous and every detail was taken care of. The menus on the table were perfect, and I would like to make sure the manager personally praises our server, who was so nice, fast and helpful. Orders were taken quicky and efficiently, and our food came really quickly as well. I will definitely recommned you guys for anyone looking for a group event, or just wanting a great place with good service and food for a night out.
5
Been at Fort for my boyfriend birthday and had their 12 course omakase. Ambience is amazi g with great music playing, staff very friendly and good quality food. Drinks are all customised to your personal preferences and they use fresh ingredients, which is very difficult to find it anywhere else. They surprised my boyfriend with a helium balloon and a sparkle at the time of the dessert. I believe the small things make a restaurant great, and they nailed it in making you feel welcome and participate throughout the dinner. Definitely will be back soon

Managed to enjoy a 1 for 1 promotion on the eggs benedict (only available for weekend brunch) thanks to Snatch app. Only 2 choices were allowed (despite having 4 different eggs benedict). I chose the signature which comes with prosciutto parma ham whereas my dining partner chose smoked salmon. Really love the perfectly poached eggs that had a merciless flowy factor, my ideal definition of a poached egg! <3 The toasted brioche in the eggs benedict was also soft, pillowy, a texture i adore and a much better substitute to the usual eng muffins IMO!
4
Yes, indeed, I'm a matcha lover (because I'm half Asian), so a place featuring matcha lava cake will surely score high points in my heart !Well Maison Ikkoku has actually more to offer than just a delicious mouthwatering matcha cake.First of all, it's a delightful place located close to the ultimately cute Haji Lane. The venue is cozy, and it's defo a great place for a breakfast or a noodle lunch.The atmosphere is relaxed & chill, the staff is smiling and friendly ; prices are correct (don't forget you're in Singapore !). So it's a big YES 
1
Had reservation for at 8:30pm, got seated but waited until 9:05pm to get our first course. Could tell the bulk of their profits came from "bespoke" cocktails. We didn't order any drinks and it was clear more attention went to patrons who were ordering rounds and rounds of cocktails. Food was pathetic, first course was a tiny side dish of pickled veggies. Then followed by simple plain greens with yuzu dressing nothing else accompanied. Dessert was a tragic single roasted marshmallow on a wooden stick. The creativity portion when it comes to food was a massive let down. There was no harmony to the different courses, they just serve you whatever they have in their tiny kitchen. Portions are so tiny, i wouldn't be surprised if they were all catered to kids. This place isn't worth the energy to cab or walk into Fort Canning nor is it worth your time. Very poor food planning & portioning, poor service. The only good thing is the ambiance but the sound system kept having issues throughout the night. I had high expectations about this place but all i got in return was a ruined Saturday night!
5
Perfect breakfast! Cute cafe with wonderful food and coffee. The fruit salad was amazing. The salmon and eggs delicious!
5
Excellent cocktails in a cosy intimate bar, small terrace overlooking mosque. Unique and refreshing.
5
I'm a professional bartender,i was in this cocktail bar with my gf,the bartenders makes amazing drink,I told to the bartender I like gin and the,he made me a earl gray gin Martini plus elderflower.... WOW!!!!
Highly recommended

My usual go to joint when I need strong and consistently good coffee. Love the M.I speciality latte especially!

We tried the 12 course Omakase meal..First of all the place is very well decorated. Music is great and good place for a date. Food is sub par. Good value for $68 but your money goes into the place over food. ComeFor a great date but not if u are a foodie. Onsen egg with garlic sauce was worse than Killiney Kopitiam. Salad was just fresh greens with ponzu sauce. And the sushis were lower grade fish. I won't come again 
1
Had our v day dinner and I was anticipating a great time but it was outrageous. Outrageously disappointing. Had a bespoke drink and it came with a straw that belongs to a Kopitiam. The egg (I think it was the appetiser) was underwhelming. The steak was cold and gamey (Wagyu steak) and clincher was the chocolate dessert in a small test tube which was probably less than a tablespoon. Wow. The quality of the food doesn't justify the price.
4
As mentioned the snickers cake was rather nice and not too sweet. I am a coffee drinker but when I ordered the long black they did not tell me what beans were used until I ask about when my coffee was brought to me. The stern guy was informed though and told me the mixed blend. Place is quaint and highly patronized
5
Hidden within Fort Canning is a restaurant-bar well worth the drive/walk uphill. Been there a few times but never disappointed. Offering affordable 12-course Omakase at $68 that's ever-changing and do look out for seasonal Omakase during festive periods such as Christmas and Chinese New Year. Had the CNY Omakase which blown me away with indulgences like the Miso Abalone, Otoro Nigiri and Unagi Don. The bespoke cocktails were favourites of mine which I cannot leave without! Beautiful place to dine in with friendly service too
5
Without our local friend anthony pang we would never have found this excellent cocktail bar...The mixologist made us some drinks never to forget..It is really a place to put on your to do list when going for drinks after dinner in SingaporeDo it!
3
Without spoiling the surprise for potential patrons, the experience was fun - you anticipate your food with some level of trepidation as the tapas-size portions tempt your appetite progressively. I would have expected a wider range of food options and a couple of items were sub-par. A decent experience overall
5
Amazing! Best night we had in Singapore. Unique expression. Great food and awesome cocktails. Service was on point. This truely made our stay.
4
We stumbled across Fort and it was a good find, high quality food in a cozy environment. We had sliders and pasta which was excellent, drinks were slightly pricey though, but all in all great place!
5
A delightful and quaint establishment which maintains most congenial personnel!
Hand brewed coffee had the most delectable aroma and flavour!
4
Really good western food in the Kampong Glam area. We were surprised with the lunchtime special price of $5 off every main. Great drinks with fresh juices, interesting fruit iced teas and coffee.
4
I stumbled upon the place and decided to have dinner there. My husband and I were the only guests. It is a bar cum dining place. The unagi linguine was absolutely delicious! We tried the mock tails and they tasted wonderful! Ambience was relaxed. Staff were attentive
4
I was taken here by my hosts and was pleased with the originality of the menu and also the bar. We ordered the 12 course tapas-style menu and I liked about 9 of them. Which isn't bad! The bar was unconventional in that there were no regular cocktails. The barman asked which type of drinks you like and then produced some cocktails which were variations of you preferences. I was surprised at the results which were nice
4
Set atop Fort Canning Hill with a view towards Orchard Road, it has a nice ambience. Seating is mostly around a central bar.Service is friendly and they do announce the food like fine dining establishments.Parking is free and aplenty outside of Pinacotheque Museum as well as nearby car park B.I was here for a friend's birthday with a special menu. Food portions were small. I noticed that they have set menu as well as degustation for a reasonable price.Certainly worth a second visit
5
Thank you to Jane, Adrian and Eugene who made our evening extremely pleasant! We stumbled across this restaurant after visiting the Battle box at Fort Canning and decided to hang around for their 6.30 Omakase sitting. The price is very reasonable for a delicious 12 course meal and the cocktails were awesome! We will definitely be returning..

LocationTo speak the truth, whether you drive or do not drive , the location of the bar is not easy to find. It is situated beside the Fort Canning Hotel. You can park at the public carpark or the hotel carpark, in both cases, you will still need to walk. For public transport, the nearest MRT is the Doby Ghaut MRT. After which you need to walk a bit of distance up the hill to reach this Bar. But because of this, it is very private and not that rowdy as compared to other bars in Clarke Quay or Boat Quay. There is absolute privacy and it is a romantic place.FOODWe tried only the a la carte. The raw stuffs are fresh and paired with interesting seasoning. It is good. They have set degustation which to our surprise is not expensive. A set of 12 fusion dishes is only SG$69++. The chef is very bold in his taste and tries to whip up very interesting selections. From the main entrance you have to turn right and walk straight and you will see the bar there. There are some other restaurants but they are on the basement level. DRINKSThe drinks on the other hand is rather pricey and if you get high and want to drink more especially the cocktail, beware cos the base cheapest price of one drink is SG$22 ++. Also House pours and beers are not cheap too. But there are many interesting mix here and no standard menu. You can get the bartender to whip up something interesting for you.SERVICEBy far we felt the service was good and nothing to complain about, the place is rather small as compared to what is seen on magazine and every one has to sit around the bar. There are some outdoor seats too but it will mean a miss to all the action at the bar
3
I booked the restaurant to celebrate my 3 GF birthday after seeing the introduction from Bengpire show. Although food quality is still relatively good but the presentation is very very much lacking as compared to what they feature in the show. Also their mocktail drinks are much expensive $24 as compared to their 12 course omakase dinner at $68. Felt it was somewhat a rip-off on the drinks
5
The beef rendang benedict was so mouthwateringly delicious. I still think about it. I only had breakfast here, but I here the cocktails are inspired and delicious.
4
The coffee was excellent with strong aroma. Aglio Olio was delicious. Cakes was cut into a very generous portion, texture and taste was good but I finds it a bit too sweet. Overall the service was good and a good place to chill out.
5
Found this place randomly, but what a surprise! The bartender was really skillful and made us delicious and fancy drinks! Just let him know your preference and he'll make you satisfied.
5
Goos times here! Drinks on a good lvl and bar team really nice, definitely worth checking it out!
Place also serves food but we were there just for drinks :)

[note: this review is just about the service. I didn't even get to try the food.]Wanted to check out Fort by Maison Ikkoku today for a special occasion. I got a 830pm 2nd seating reservation.Part of the party arrived early at 8 and were ushered into some corridor behind the restaurant, given some bar stools and shared a waiting area" with what looked like part of the restaurant's stock. It was suggested drinks be ordered whilst waiting for the 630 seating to finish. There were other 830pm parties too.At 840pm, a young waiter is sent over and tells us apologetically (though somewhat seeming as though he had been intentionally thrown to the lions, or customers as hungry as one, by unfeeling management) that it would take another 10-15min as the 630pm seating were into their last course.When asked about the delay, he said some of the patrons had come late and the restaurant seeks to serve all together since it's omakase (presumably easier on the kitchen). At 8.55pm, the last course has still not been served and it transpires that the earlier patrons are on the 2nd last course at best. I ask to speak to the person in charge and I'm pointed to Executive director / senior master mixologist / head chef...Ethan Leslie Leong. Gosh his titles are as plenty as his service attitude and contrition is lacking:- I inquired on the delay and that nothing had moved since the 840pm announcement. Shockingly, he said it could not be helped "if our customers eat slowly". He claimed, the last course would be served "soon". No attempt to manage the situation or give and indication on how long more the wait would be- as one of my party was feeling unwell, we informed that we could not wait and would be giving up our place. I inquired on the bill for the 2 drinks ordered. I asked if something would be done about the wait and inconvenience (genuinely hoping for a contrite apology, not free drinks) but was met with a wall of callousness. - Not realising he was not just a mere staff but the boss (there wasn't any gravitas to give it away) I asked if it was due to policy he could not be flexible. I mean sometimes an employee's hands are tied from making it up to a hangry customer. He actually snarkily said, "our policy is you drink, you pay. You eat, you pay!" I guess I also missed out on the clause saying "I book, I don't get to eat!" That really took the cake.- so after settling the bill, one of my party informed that a bad review was in order given the unpleasant experience. Ethan gave a patronizing look and said, "thank you! See you again!". You could feel the sarcasm dripping. So I guess that's that. I will be having some reservations before I foray toFort again. Pity about the poor service attitude of the boss @ Ethan. The staff were far more genuine and you could sense true regret for our predicament. The drinks were good! Not sure if they were done by "head mixologist" cos they were sweet, in contrast to his sour face. For those intending to try: aimFor the 630 seating. They're clearly flexible with time. If you are saddled with the second seating, may be a good idea to eat before going

My wife and I showed up on a whim for an after dinner cocktail. This was a great idea. I'd been here before and remembered that the cocktails were excellent. This is probably one of few instances where describing a cocktail as "bespoke" is a legitimate move. The bartenders ask you "which base?" and follow up with a few other details. And then they whip something elegant up. Sometimes fairly standard (an old fashioned with a twist). Sometimes radical (monkey grape - I don't even where to begin except to say "grape" was accurate). Always carefully executed. It has an outdoor section with a great view of the Sultan Mosque.To be sure, these cocktails are not cheap. But they are well worth it. Treat yourself. To make the night a little more special, there was some sort of promotion going on for "Singapore Manhunt." I'm still not sure I fully understand what was being promoted. But it involved a lot of guys in way better shape than I not wearing shirts and taking photos with my wife. This was awesome and I hope whatever it is they were doing works out for them.
5
I found this place on my lonely planet book and loved it. I had this beef donburi that was delicious and it was exactly what I wanted. And to drink I had this apple + lemongrass + ginger iced tea and it was delicious as well. Everything was 16,90. Definately recommend this place
5
Have to say, that I was shocked at first glance seeing the prices of our breakfest to be ordered. BUT, had to change my view completely by the end of our stay.Perfect quality breakfest especially when having to fill yourself with energy before a whole day sightseeing tour in Singapore.Very delicious food, and great choice of various breakfest solutions. Both kids and parents find what they need for the day.Was absolutely worth the money. Bit costly for my standards, but we didnt need lunch instead
1
My hubby tried their lunch and highly recommendated their coffee to me. So we decided to go for their breakfast this morning, and I had a horrible experience. The food looks really good. But sadly, the cappuccino was tasted sour and the smoked salmon was not fresh and tasted fishy. I asked my hubby to tried the salmon and he agreed it's not fresh. I politely requested for a change but there was no apologies from them at all. As I was sitting near the kitchen, I heard the cook complaining loud and clear.... He said, "it's smoked salmon, of course it's not fresh. They thought its fresh salmon, is it?" I guess he think I have never eaten smoked salmon before. After hearing his complaints, I lose my appetite and decided to ask for a refund instead. The only good thing is they agreed to refund without any argument.

We were at Fort Canning for walk when we chance upon this restaurant we checked the menu and we decided to come back for dinner.We ordered the 12 course omakase which was very good. It was a nice surprise, the food and drinks are tasty and creatively done. The restaurant was quiet with only 2 couples when we were there. Their service was attentive
5
This place was amazing!! I really love the cocktails here. I had the yuzu sour and they are so good!!!
4
Good variety of food from breakfast food to pastries for tea to coffee, all day long.
My favourite ~ Maison Royal (healthy fruits & yoghurt).
5
This was a perfect spot for late night cocktails. It is one of the ‘original’ bespoke cocktail bar concepts in Singapore and the cocktails are wonderful!
5
Coole Location upstairs... Super Drinks. Tolls Barkeeper. Einfach Geschmackswunsch nennen und sich überraschen lassen...
Menton your taste and get a great drink, which will surprise you.
4
- Cosy Ambience
- Can get crowded at times
- Slow service but worth the wait
- Nice Coffee and Yummy Sinful Cakes
- Try the Red Velvet and Boston Chocolate.
5
I had my first singapore sling here! Excellent! Wonderful staff! Really enjoyed going to Maison Ikkoku! Please save some time to go and try one of their great cocktails.
5
Chanced upon this restaurant via a recommendation..classy yet cosy vibes and super friendly service staff..Beautiful 12 course omakase..oka yes humbly, but do not underestimate them... so fresh with flavours close to the heart! Not to mention, Ethan, Matteo and Adrian made 10 of us feel so special with the bespoke cocktails they made..we tried a couple of their housemade infusions....Blue Cheese gin for cheese lovers, pandan, red dates, hibiscus etc..this place is as genuine as it can be. You will be surprised to find such a treasure hidden amidst tranquil Fort Canning Hill! Tourists friendly... definitely no rip off gimmicky stunts here. 12 course Omakase at 68 only!!

My partner and i visited the restaurant on the 30th March, which was a Wednesday night. There were only 2 of us and another couple that evening. It was a very nice, quiet restaurant and we enjoyed our time tremendously. The service was prompt as there was only 4 of us, everyone was friendly and we felt very comfortable dining there. The whole decor of the place was very chill and chic, music added the right touch to the ambience. Although the seating were mainly around the island bar counter, it was still relatively comfortable. We had the 12 course Omakase set which cost $68. It was very worth it as every dish tasted good with a few stand outs like the salmon carpaccio, grilled chicken, unagi rice and sorbet. Dishes might not be all fancy and exquisite but it tasted good. For the price we paid, we would definitely recommend it. Ordered the bespoke cocktail too and i loved it! I asked for "Sweet" and was given a Blackberry, Yuzu, Vodka cocktail which i absolutely love! It was slightly more expensive than the regular cocktails but the mixologist was very professional and really ensured we enjoyed the drinks. The bespoke cocktails cost between $$22 to $26. The Omakase set and 1 drink would cost you about $100/person. I might go back to visit again if there are updates to the menu as the choices are limited. Reservations are recommended during weekends as it might get packed

Went there a few days ago for dinner only to find it pleasantly quiet. Despite being in a secluded setting it was not at all hard to find, just a walk away from Fort Canning Hotel. The restaurant itself was hauntingly beautiful (perhaps all the more so for the lack of crowd), with lovely lighting and elegant furnishings. The choice of music was great as well, matching the mood of the placeOpted for the Chinese New Year set menu, which was pretty delicious albeit small. The smoked duck was particularly memorable. I would say that the salmon was slightly too well done but still very acceptable. Went for the cocktail pairing as well, all of which were very good- and nicely sized to go with the meal. It started with a lemongrass sake (to go with the scallop) which had a very nice delicate flavour, enough to tease your tastebuds. The second was a Prosecco with little caviar balls which by itself was okay but worked to the second course's favour (the duck) as it didn't over power the smoky taste of the food. The third was a cocktail made of mandarin and cinnamon and sugar- a perfect drink. The last was a sweet cocktail then by Itself finished off nicely as dessert.A bit pricey for the portion size but this is fine dining with really great cocktails- worth a shot definitely

Stumbled upon this place for an early night cocktails and this is great place to try their bespoke cocktails. No menu is present and the bartender makes drinks the way you want it. Tried the smoked whisky and a sour vodka in the first round to warm up the interaction with the bartender. When you encourage the bartender good enuf, he would try some extreme mixes like mixing skippy nutella and whisky. Another good one was a passion fruit and vodka. The final drink which the bartender made was an Indian based rasam kinda drink. Definitely a good place to try bespoke cocktails
5
A great spot for Sunday Brunch!
Also be sure to try the cocktail bar upstairs no menu so the bar tender creates something based on what you fancy at the time

Visited this cafe during Singapore's National Day and was treated free coffee (below $5) with every food order. We ordered their signature eggs benedict and teriyaki chicken pasta. Both was fantastic and definitely worth trying.
4
10 cocktails amongst 4 friends.
They ask for your tastes and then make to meet.
8/10 were to my liking. That isn't to say they weren't good, but rather just not all to my taste. The one that I was very defined on, was superb.
4
We tried the coffee here. Love the coffee because it does not taste light. The ambience of the cafe is cosy. There is outside sitting too but not everyone will like it because it is by the road.There are car parks available there. It is accessible by public transport too.Not a huge cafe.There is not a wide range of cakes but their speciality is coffee and that serves its purpose :
5
This place is lovely, expensive but lovely. Instead of a menu the server asks what kind of drink you would like (sweet, sour, smoky) and the bartenders personally design a cocktail everyone was happy with their cocktail. We also have small bites which were very nice especially the fried macaroni and cheese.We went late in the evening (around midnight) and there was still a good buzz in the bar but wasn't too loud that you couldn't have a conversation. Tables are small though, a group of 5 can't sit comfortably together but would make for a very impressive date venue

Small place tucked in at the end of Kandahar Street. Chanced upon it while walking around and then read good reviews online. Nice place, nice service. You have to order yourself at the counter- which is not a stretch at all. The salted French toasts were amazing. The orange juice was great too- freshly squeezed but somehow when I saw it had froth around it- almost looking like a mango shake. Would I go again- yes I would. Especially is one is in the Arab Street area. There is no other place which is a worthy competition for MI - except maybe The Hangar but then it is overcrowded and one is always under the feeling that one should leave soon
1
Waited over 30 minutes for the 'bespoke' cocktails to arrive, when they did the flavour was uninspired with one sad twig of Thyme flopped on top and there was no thyme within the cocktail. The service staff did not explain what was in the cocktails and was not interested in taking our order or giving it. At the end it was the most expensive cocktail I've had in Singapore and service charge included even though there was no service. It then appeared that the 'bespoke' cocktails had names on the bill that were not custom. On another note the coffee downstairs is very good :)
4
I chanced upon this restaurant cum cocktail bar when visiting the Art Museum at the Fort Canning Art Centre. It was the unusual setting that attracted me initially. It is a restaurant with counter seating only so this is not a good place for groups. The design is trendy and looks out over Fort Canning Hill towards the city. The food is Japanese inspired and in small interesting portions. Mainly seafoods with very minimal meat dishes.Their specialty include cocktails designed to suit your pallet. There are not cocktail menu and you are asked to describe the type of cocktail you would like to have in Sweet/Sour/Bitter and the mixologist will create something to your liking. Good experience and very attentive service
4
I chanced upon this quaint cafe as I was staying in a nearby hostel. I loved the interior and also the atmosphere of the cafe. Food wise, it was good~! Coffee was lovely too and I must say, it's value for money. I would come back again if I am in Singapore again
4
Maison Ikkoku is a charming little place where we have been for brunch. They have a wide variety of coffees and the cold pressed ones are excellent! They throw in a coffee free with every main ( I donâ€™t believe this was a special offer but just the regular menu), which make it a good deal indeed. Our table loved the Poached Eggs rendang style, as well as the avocado on toast with feta and scrambled eggs. Plus, the folks were very smiley and friendly. Definitely going back
5
This is the best bar in town!! They make you drinks after what you tell them- no drinklist!! Every drink is a piece of art! Small and intimate bar with friendly staff that is passionate about their work! Love it!
4
Place is pretty cosy. Food is nice and price is reasonable. But the main difference here is the coffee. It just taste nicer, especially their MI latte. Worth going back for their coffee and come snacks.
3
Food was above average and good ambience, place get crowded after 9pm for dinner. Average price range as other cafe nearby.
5
Found a little treasure in Singapore: great coffee in a lovely little coffee shop with atmosphere and very friendly service. Not easy to find- just a single door off the street down near the mosque.
5
This review is for the bar on the second level, not the cafe downstairs. Service is very reliable and polished compared with some of the other speakeasy bars around. As is with the trend nowadays, the option of sweet, salty, sour or bitter brought forth a luscious purple berry rum mojito once I settled upon sweet. Having been there a couple of times, I have never had the same cocktail twice, and some of their dessert- like cocktails are better than the lackluster desserts served in some restaurants. I shan't go into too much detail, since a bespoke cocktail requires only your craving and the cocktail masters creativity to result in a fantalicious treat. The only reason why I don't go there too often is that one cocktail is upward of S$30, and how does one stop at just one!
5
Visited the place 2 days in a row. Coffee was good, chicken burger was delicious. Was feeling rather adventurous so we went for ondeh-ondeh cake without even knowing what ondeh-ondeh was, I was pleasantly surprised. The cake was very good, extremely moist, the portion was massive. Will definitely return
5
Want the ultimate bar experience in Singapore? This is definitely the place to go! Forget about those fancy hotel bars where bar keepers quietly check their recipe book after you order from an endless list of cocktails on the menu. At this place, you do not even get a menu! They ask you what you like, come up with great recommendations and mix you a drink you would not believe it. Truly awesome. Yes, prices are steep. But no regrets. After all, you are not in a backbackerÂ´s den but in one of the "go to" areas in Singapore
4
If looking for a good chilled out bar experience with unique conjured up cocktails to help enhance the conversation and experience, I would recommend this place. A little tricky to find, but well worth the treck and effort. The prices were a bit on the higher side - but hey, this is Singapore! Definitely rate them as a bar well worth checking out as long as cocktails is on the agenda
5
Do youself a solid the next time you are in Singapore and hit up Maison Ikkoku for a quaff. The staff are amazing and unlike other bars you there is no set cocktail menu. If you feel like something refreshing, made with gin, and has pineapple - a drink appears right in front of you make to those exact specifications. I've never had a cruddy drink at this place. Never! For an added treat, call ahead and make a reservation to sit at the bar so you can watch the masters at play. Happy quaffing!
5
This bar is a must visit place ! The cocktails we had here had to be the best cocktails I ever tried The atmosphere is buzzing , decor is great and even better the bar men ! They are so friendly and so attentive to what type of drinks one wants There are no menus here - you just tell the bar men what u like and voila magic ! Seriously pay this bar a visit - it truly is the cherry on your Singapore visit Oh and the food is great too :) so do pay this place a visit - you might be hangover in the morning but the cocktails they make are genius
5
I am terrible with the mixture inside cocktail. Over here, you can tell the server what you want and what you do not like and the bartender will make you your prefect cocktail.
5
This is my favorite bar in Singapore - every drink is a master peace of its own and the location is perfect.
5
We stumbled upon this place when wondering the streets surrounding Arab street. Reminded us of a Melbourne coffee house. AMAZING coffee and friendly staff. If you are looking for a good coffee while on holiday, which can be hard to find, you need to visit this place
5
first we order cappucino and it so good. i dont know how they make it. just perfect taste. then come sandwich, last time i order salmon florentine. damn i want more... just nice combination melting cheese, fresh tuna, toast, and salad dresing. in the last we order gula malaka and banana cake. love it, will come back to here when im in sg
5
Maison Ikkoku is a real treat! No menu, but they know exactly what you want. You tell them your wish and they will make it come true, especially if you wish for nice cocktails. It's a nice little place, but very relaxing and service is excellent. It's a bit on the more pricy side but worth every dollar you spent
3
A couple of my friends and I decided to visit Maison Ikkoku to have a quiet cosy birthday celebration. We arrived at about 9.30am on a Wednesday morning. Jokingly I asked the staff if they would cook the breakfast usually served at 1100 for us, but we got an unexpectedly cold reply. Maybe this set the mood for the rather cold service the entire morning. They were nice enough to help us take a photo when we left though. I must say that the food was really good though. Between us, we had the Turkey eggs and ham, fiery omelette and a croque madame. I'd hope to go back for one of their famed sandwiches, but I'd really be wishing for a more friendly crew
5
Our son had told us about this place and as we were staying very close by, we thought we would seek it out. It was well worth it. You book in via an iPad and then have to wait, and please be prepared to wait. We were there at the weekend for breakfast. We enjoyed the aircon and the vibrancy of the venue, after 30 mins our table came available. I chose a iced caramel latte and hubby had an aero presse which took a while to prepare. To eat I chose the Toasted Brioche with Berries, whilst hubby had Eggs Benedict with Turkey Ham. It was delicious. We weren't rushed, despite them being busy and allowed to enjoy our meals.Do go and explore this little part of Kampong Glam :
5
I have been to this Bar over last several months and the more I visit the more it keeps growing on me! Last time one of my friends asked for a dessert in a glass and this bar delivered. That is not an exaggeration. But what makes Maison (as we have lovingly got to call it) special is Ethan, the man behind Maison. He exudes such an energy and what a genius with cocktails. I could write a long review but if you really want to experience this ...go find this treasure trove and tell me I am wrong
4
This place here serves good brunch, however, it gets a little too squeezy during lunch hours. Nothing much can be done about that, I guess? Choices of cakes/desserts made available in the cafe is plenty, although some of the cakes are slightly dry. Beverages served were delightful. Will definitely return to this place during non-peak hours. Love how cosy it is then
3
This place is for you if you want breakfast all day. "Break of Dawn" was served in a generous portion. Couples can share but don't think the service staff will be happy about it. Cakes are amazing. Not too sweet. Reservation policy for a group more than 10, is everyone had to order a main and a drink. Endless streaming of patrons and queues even started forming. I can see why this place is popular but there are many of them around. One out of a dozen around.Till then
4
This is a small place but very nice with leather seats and wooden tables ! Pretty decor. Food is perfect for brunch. Everything is yummy, even all the hot drink. I wanna go back !
5
If you are in the Kampong Glam area this is a must for coffee and cake. The red velvet cake is too die for. Great coffee and busy, we found if a place was busy it usually means it is good.
Highly recommend.
4
Stumbled into this place while waiting for an appointment nearby and thought it was super cute! The mango cheesecake was good though rather sweet. The iced chocolate was excellent!
3
Popped by after dinner for a after meal coffee and desserts. Ordered the latte and a salted popcorn caramel cake. Sadly, all the cakes seems to be salted caramel something.. Coffee was spot on but our cake was neither on the salty or sweet side. Some might say it's balance but it was quite blend to me. Service was good on a busy night
1
We took a brunch today with few friends & few hour after it, we all have been sick all afternoon. smoked salmon bagel & salmon scrabble & mushroom scrabble... So the egg for sure !!! Plus the service is very poor ! Brief, don't recommend the place.... :(
3
Drop-in upon seeing TripAdvisor signage.. First experience was that service crews were not welcomely, most probably of the busying.. Assigned a small square table, ordered & fully occupied with 2 big dishes & drinks.. Unapologetic from crews despite seemingly unsuitable allocation of table. Main food not recommended, even though appeared to be appetizing & filling, however taste bland & not satisfying after few tasting. However the vanilla latte was nicely strong-brewed.Overall only recommended for coffee-tasting.. Nothing else worth mentioning.
5
This small bar is tucked away in the Arab Quarters, and if we hadn't been out with locals we never would have known it existed. Mixology is apparently all the rage in Singapore at the moment and I can understand why. When you're seated, the bar tenders ask what base spirit you like and a few questions about your tastes such as sweet or sour? Herby or fruity? etc. and then they surprise you with a beautifully presented cocktail they hope you'll enjoy. We were not disappointed!! I had a rosemary gin concoction they set alight at the table, whilst my partner enjoyed a smokey (literally) whiskey drink. The atmosphere was great, it was quiet enough that you could have a conversation and the theatrics behind the bar was mesmerizing. A well-kept secret of Singapore that I recommend checking out.
5
We went to Maison Ikkoku for a couple of cocktails and nibbles. What an experience. You tell the bartender whether you want sweet or sour, refreshing or ?, spirit base and off they go...... We watched as the guys behind the bar sploshed and created the most amazing beautiful and deliciously tasty cocktails we have had anywhere. My first one was gin based with herbs. It arrived with a bunch of rosemary in the glass, it was then sprayed with alcohol and set on fire! Pure theatre and it tasted heavenly. Another one was due to cocktail envy of one of our party who saw someone be served a creamy cocktail but with a toasted marshmallow. Her cocktail started with Nutella being smeared round the glass then various potions were added and the marshmallow 'side order' was toasted and a drizzle of chocolate was flash frozen on to it with liquid nitrogen! It took all of us in the party to restrain our friend not to completely lick the glass clean! We had snack food too, which good, if not slightly overpriced. The cocktails more than made up for it though.Tip : sit at the bar to observe the real masters at work. A truly wonderfully entertaining evening
4
Went for dinner but realise they only serve all day breakfast. Tried them and come in super bigggg portion. Really value for money. Was so food after taking that.Didn't tried their coffee but my friend did, and looks really nice. For cake wise, tried red velvet nutella, a bit too sweet for me. Not to my liking.Overall service is alright, and the main dish is really affordabl
4
I went to this cafe happens that it is near the place that I planned to go. I got my lunch - egg benedict and coffee. They have lunch promotion during weekend, when you order any lunch main course, you can get the coffee for FREE. That is great save for me. Lunch is crowded but I was alone so great that I still can get a seat.Egg Benedict here I would said is one of the best I had tried among so many cafe. The egg is just great, egg white is done and yolk is running. The sauce is great too. No comment on the desserts but the desserts that day didn't attract me, also because I dun have room for it to try out. Coffee is great too. If you happen to be around that area during weekday, you can pop by for lunch
5
My favourite cocktail bar in Singapore! Cute, small, friendly bar staff... Wonderful creations... All fresh and freaky ingredients.... We bring all our visiting guests here and they all have loved their Maison Ikkoku experience...
4
Went on an easter Sunday for Brunch. Great find as all-day breakfast food was value for money. Coffee was good too but it wasn't hot and they didn't allow to re-warm.
The place is tiny but conducive for convo.
4
Good coffee, bold and smooth. However, for the price that they're charging, they should've better chairs and tables. The chairs were very uncomfortable, ok more like a stool really. The tables were tiny and mis-matched. I suppose I prefer a more polished feel. But coffee was great and on that basis, I will return if I'm in the area
5
We stumbled across this cafe whilst walking around Arab Street area trying to find somewhere to eat.It's a great place to relax after some hectic bartering in Arab Street, where the food and cakes are delicious, with healthy portions. Grab a table inside, order and pay for the food and drinks and the staff happily bring your order over. Wifi also available.
4
I've heard plenty from my friends who have been here and they raved so much about the coffee, atmosphere and food that I simply had to try it sooner (rather then later).Although it was a Saturday evening at around 715pm, there wasn't much crowd. We nabbed a cozy spot next to the door, with sofas and our back to the wall panelling. It was a pretty interesting place as we had the privilege of looking at the types of people walking in the door. My keen eye spotted a socket plug at our table, and immediately started charging my phone.Coffee was excellent while the Lady Lemon cake that we ordered looks tasty but fell flat to our expectations. They have other cake selections on display as well but the selection/names didn't catch my attention.The staff/service is highly commendable. Even though we were seated near the door, the cashier took note of our departure and bid us adieu.Would definitely be back here again!Tips:- Our seat had 2 socket plugs so internet/phone junkies would love this spot to recharge your phone- Don't sit outside unless you are sure that the people at the table next to yours are not going to smoke.- If you prefer a cooler, air-conditioned experience, it is better if you take a seat further into the cafe
5
It's rare to find an establishment that does two seemingly different things so well, but Maison Ikkoku impresses with its coffee and its cocktails.A friend of mine who works in Arab Street introduced me to this place and I can't stop going back there. The hot coffees are wonderful but it's been a long time since I've so enjoyed iced coffees and I have to say there's is one of the best I've had.The bar upstairs has got to be one of the best I've been to in Singapore. I generally find bars noisy and irritating, but Maison Ikkoku gives exactly the opposite atmosphere. Its small and cosy and very very relaxed. In fact on two occasions, there have been no more than 5-6 people in the bar when I've gone! The mixologists are very good. I'm not big on cocktails since I prefer wine, but I must say every drink I've had there has been good. And their bar snacks are delightful as well - a must try is the smoked duck.It is a lot more expensive than regular bars but if you are an occasional bar visitor like me, then I highly recommend this place
5
I went at 4pm on a Sunday evening. Best decision ever. We hit the cafe, had their amazing chocolate peanut cake (don't quite remember the names). After which, we decided to go upstairs and check the bar out. We were there from about 5 onwards. Stayed for a good 4 hours. Every cocktail was enjoyable, the mixologists are the best I've met; they cater to each and every request accordingly. Highly highly recommended. This review is based on my first visit. And, I've been back about 4 times since! Pictures uploaded speak for themselves! You are in for a treat, guaranteed
4
Found this the website. The pictures of the outside view are very misleading. The bar is actually inside. That said it was a very good atmosphere and the cocktails are excellent. You have to look for the numbers on the door (number 20) as its just a door way leading upstairs

For more reviews, visit my blog at ms-skinnyfatWeekends are for brunches and i finally checked out Maison Ikkoku's brunch offerings! I don't know why i took so long to visit but anyway i'm glad i finally did because it was purrrrrfect. Nothing makes me happier than brunch with perfectly done eggs, a strong and aromatic cuppa and of course great company. What sets Maison Ikkoku apart from the regular coffee shop is that it sells a lifestyle and not just a product. Think of it as a one stop shop for the chill out weekend; Maison Ikkoku is branded as a lifestyle boutique combining mid-high end international menswear retail, a café centered on quality coffee and the perfect semi-alfresco cocktail bar.I was too occupied with brunch to check out the other levels but anyway.. Great Iced Mocha that wasn't too sweet. Bittersweet and intense melted chocolate was used with the strong coffee that had my head and tummy singing. Girls being girls, we each ordered a different dish so that we could try as many dishes as possible. The adventurous Y went for the Spicy Beef Rendang Fusion sandwich. Not my typical choice for brunch (i'm boring that way) but this was a surprisingly fiery and exciting option that i would consider in the future. It's easy on the coconut so you can taste the well flavored rempah but it's pretty spicy.I struggled with my brunch choice and in the end i went for the Croque Madame instead of the Eggs Benedict. Great flavors from the honey glazed ham, gruyere and home-made béchamel but it just seemed a little dry with the toasted pain de campagne.The benedict/florentine really takes the cake here at Maison Ikkoku. Full bodied and well balanced Hollandaise sauce is so hard to come by and this was da bomb. Loved the texture, loved the flavors, loved the overall moisture of every bite. The savory spinach in the Salmon Florentine gave the dish an interesting twist and made me crave for more. While the brunch items were great, the desserts were meh. We had the Blueberry Cheesecake which was very light. I liked the graham crust but found it too crumbly! The blueberry sauce was a tad too sweet and require some tartness to balance it out. The Salted Caramel Chocolate Cake was really dense a la brownie texture but it tasted empty. I really wouldn't wanna be wasting my calories on this one.Maison Ikkoku is definitely on my favorites list. Enjoy

Most coffee shops in Singapore use machines that you find in airline lounges, not a proper coffee machine manufactured in Italy. So it was a delight to walk into this tiny bolt-hole, see the machine, smell the beans and order a Latte and a Capucchino. The barista knows his stuff, the coffee was strong but not bitter, milk perfectly foamed and just the right temperature (just under hot). We loved it so much we came back for seconds. Soundtrack in the background was cool, the service was friendly and efficient and we got our caffeine hit. Very satisfied
4
Awesome coffee, yummy eggs benedict. Pity I didn't have space for their cakes. A return soon!!!

Maison Ikkoku is the only place in Singapore where I will order espresso based coffee. After weeks of hunting around the city for a decent espresso based coffee, I mostly gave up. The stuff you get from Starbucks, Coffee Connoisseur, Tea Leaf & Bean and similar is junk. Usually watery, tepid, and bitter. Mostly, I got comfortable with the kopi houses all over singapore for my caffeine fix. It's a very different kind of drink, but once you get used to it, I found it to be a better option than the other coffee available.Anyway, back to Maison Ikkuku. This is the place I visit on the weekend, when I want to have a real coffee. Fresh ground beans, well roasted, and made properly with a decent espresso machine operated by people that know what they're doing. Best coffee I've had in Singapore. I gave it 4 stars, because even though it's the best, it's not comparable to what's available in Melbourne
5
One thing I do know about is BARS having drunk and been drunk in some of the best and most of the worst in Asia. Maison Ikkoke is right up there with just the best cocktails money ( and lots of it ) can buy. The chap making the drinks really made an effort and I look forward to another visit.May be a smart thing to book a table when the trendies are out. Got my five star award which is rare !Can not wait to my next call in.Not a kid place at all up stairs

This is one of the apparently mushrooming "artisinal coffee" houses in Singapore - but this mushroom seems to be a toadstool. It's a pleasant enough looking long, thin shop house on the edge of the Arab Street area. The ambience is pleasant enough, but the downhill ride starts when you get the menu. Unless you want to go for a tried and tested espresso-based drink, you have to select from a matrix of 8 different ways to make your coffee, times three different beans. The serve-bot on duty Monday night had absolutely no idea what the characteristics of the Costa Rican beans were, and suggested we make his life easier by sticking to Brazilian. Thanks.The "artisinal" methods seem to consist of odd-shaped contraptions designed to amuse the barista, while separating the customer from their money in exchange for lousy coffee. I had the siphon - apparently a late 19th century method enjoying a revival, which "accentuates the acids in the coffee". In plain English, makes it rancid, dishwatery and gut-wrenching.My companion had the Brazilian coffee in the Chemex, which was supposed to accentuate the nutty flavours in the coffee. Which it did, if by "accentuate", they meant "make taste like the hazelnuts were ingested by a dog and farted into the cup". The end result was that two caffeineheads were unable to finish a $7 cup. Other "artisinal" choices include the French Press - which is the $15 coffee plunger you can buy from Cold Storage, which produces the minimal acceptable home coffee; A "Woodneck" - which seems to be how Ya Kun makes its $1.50 coffee - and the V60 pour over, which is a basic paper filter. Save your money and go somewhere with large espresso machines and less artistic delusions

Was at the establishment this PM with my 2 years old twin boys & 6 year old daughter. They were playing with their newly acquired toy cars and had wandered off while we were eating, and that was when one of their female staff decided to tell one of my boys & his sister off by telling them not to play in the cafe. The same staff that I noticed that was giving us the looks, since the time we walked in, or everytime my kids were being, well, kids!!! Now, I've been to a lot of diners as that is what i love to do, with my family but I must say that this is the first time that my kids were told to sit in their chairs & behave. I understand that you are running a business & was told that it's for "safety reason" and that it's not a playground (duh!) but i don't get the point of her telling a 6 year old & a 2 year old kid & not straight to their parents, if at all my kids were misbehaving.  If indeed family with kids are not their preferred guests, then i think there should be some sort of signage or indications that that is the cafe's policy & i'll be sure to avoid ur cafe in the future. Or at the very least, markings in the cafe, where kids are free to roam & treated like little adults that they are and not a nuisance.  What was suppose to be a nice family outing turned out to be anything but that. Didn't get to finish our coffee or the salmon sandwich that we bought either as all we could think of was to get out of there & never to come back.

Maison Ikkoku is more than jjust a brunch place and a fantastic coffee joint. On the second storey of that cosy shophouse is, in my opinion, the best cocktail bar in Singapore. It stands out for me because of the dedication of its head bartender and owner, Ethan, and the consistency of their cocktails. They do not have a cocktail menu, and although you can order the classics, they have exceptional cocktails that are concocted simply by mentioning your preferences in taste and style. The first one I tried there was prepared after I mentioned that I preferred sour and strong. I was served the most memorable cocktail I've had to date in Singapore, the Torch daiquiri. It's a very unusual daiquiri infused with torch ginger and served with a little floating origami boat, folded out of a torch ginger petal and filled with mint liqueur. The latter is to be gulped after the drink is savoured in order to cleanse the palate before the next drink. Other cocktails I would recommend are the ginger Mojito and the Negroni. Cocktails cost about SGD22 on average. As a side note, Ethan is the bartender who designed the most expensive cocktail in Singapore - The Jewel of Pangaea. A glass of this expensive elixir will set you back SGD32,000 but comes with a Mouawad diamond

I love their latte. Their american breakfast is so good, it is much better than any that I had in the US or even at the American club. However, you have to be the first patrons if you go on a weekend, the breakfast takes an extremely long time (I guess, thus the quality). The cafe is quite cramped. Most of the tables can comfortably accommodate 4 medium-sized people. Parking around there can be a problem at certain hours of the day. These, however, would not stop me from visiting again
4
A nice place near Arab Street. The menu is very Continental brunch-ish. Eggs benedict, waffles, lots of coffees etc. I am not a huge fan of this kind of food, but I had a caramel french toast, which was very nice. It is small, but has a nice ambience, and the others we ate with loved it
4
Around the corner from the mosque on Arab street is a gem of a cafe offering good 'artisanal' coffee, free WIFI, a tasty western breakfast and floating furniture in the ceiling. The environment reminds me of a nice cafe in a college town in the US. Single patrons tap on their laptops, couples nurse lattes over quiet conversation, and boisterous families share their French toast, breakfast for champions (eggs, bacon, sausage, toast and blood orange salad) and other delicious delights. Although my European husband thought the French toast was too sweet, I found the toasted walnuts on his plate perfectly addictive. My meaty breakfast for champions sated my morning hunger, and I wasn't able to finish all my toast, which was delicious but too filling.I would definitely go back to this cafe. The row of shophouses in which it sits offers other businesses, restaurants and cafes that look interesting. I noticed an Austrian cafe a few doors down from Maison Ikkoki that offers Kaiserschmarn, a favorite dessert of mine from Austria
5
Fab place! I started in the very cool upstairs men's wear shop. Mostly stuff from Japan but also some European brands. Then headed downstairs for awesome coffe, strong and creamy. I didn't eat but all the sweets looked great! A must when on Singapore both for shopping and coffee. The third floor is occupied by their cocktail bar and there is also a rooftop terrace. Ambitious place that pulls it off
