Always a good taco time at señor. Great service at the Clarke quay outlet. Get the fish taco! Super yum
4
Had a wide variety of authentic sounding Mexican food. Never had them in Mexico so I wild know exactly how they taste like, but generally good!
5
Food is value for money, was served by friendly and attentive staff making my dining experience enjoyable. Will go back again
3
Taco ingredients were not generous at all, music was abrupt and played off YouTube. Happy hour was decent and so was the service
3
Senor Taco is conveniently located in Clark Quay area amidst many choices of food offerings, from middle eastern,mexican,french, Italian cuisine,irish pib and german brauhaus. Drinks were ok. Food, was somewhat average as we have eaten Mexican Dishes in many places across various countries.
4
The senor taco isn’t a bad place to dine. Food is good, and the location is good. Most of the servers has got service, only one maybe having a bad day
2
Had the classic quesadilla which was served looked unappealing and portion was small for its price. Also tried the al pastor taco, which the waitress said was their popular item but the meat was tough. Wouldn’t visit again.
1
If some one want to enjoy Tamil song please visit this Mexican place. All good and amazing because of location however all staff is Php and Tamils so basically you don’t get the feel of Mexican bar..Very disappointed even after speaking to staff.. non stop Tamil songs..

We stopped here mostly for margaritas, but did have some food as well. We sat outside, where on can observe the passing crowd and surrounding action in the busy Clarke Quay part of town. Although it was raining hard, the wonderful high canopies that have been constructed over the outdoor areas between the buildings kept us nice and dry. The margaritas were good, if expensive (as is all alcohol in Singapore), and the food was typical Mexican fare
3
In the heart of buzzing Clarke Quay.A lot of choice in the area - which I can thoroughly recommend.Señor Taco bisects the street. Menu was typical Tex-Mex fayre, however I felt they could offer more choices - I wanted more than an individual taco, but the only substantial offering was the quesadilla. I went for the burrito, which was okay... I think would have been better as a place to chill with friends, rather than go for dinner.Staff very friendly, service was quick. Buzzing place with a live band
5
After an eventful evening out at Clarke Quay, this is the best spot to grab a quick bite before heading home.
Very accommodating to varied dietary needs, even made a special no carb meal for me..
Excellent..
4
The food is pricey but delicious, as a tip go on Tuesdays where they do 1 for 1 tacos, try all the flavours!
3
My first time to a Mexican pub and it was good. Rather crowded and noisy inside for conversation so we opted to sit just outside where we can listen to the live band (which was awesome) and also watch the people dancing. Nice food though it is on the pricey side.
2
Not a great place for family with elderly folk or little children as all their chairs are high bar stools. Some of their lightbulbs were no longer working and they didn't have any spares to replace them so that where we were seated was too dark to read the menu and to see our food properly. Some portions of food was really too scanty, like not enough fish to taste in the taco, for example. The pork soup didn't have pork flavour at all but tasted onky of salt with slight taste of paprika. The staff were helpful but the faciliies and food just didn't satisfy!
5
Great service by the manager Ryan. Staff were attentive and great Mexican foods. Live band played nice Latino songs with guests dancing on the centre area
1
I should have listened to my sister not to go in -- (she lives in Arizona) and who knows about good, authentic Mexican food. This is not the place ! I was dying for Mexican food (I'm from NY) so she caved in and let me choose this place. Small portions, and overpriced. The food tasted completely Asian,.......that's not what I expect when eating Mexican food
4
Atmosphere was decent, though the choice of music wasn't perfect and the lyrics broadcasted seemed a little perculiar.Food was decent, would say that I'd get more bang for my buck at Guzman Y Gomez, which is really cheaper and serves better food.Service is really good, staff are patient and cheerful.Otherwise, this spot is definitely worth visiting with friends!
3
There is a live band here and is good for chill out. Will come back again in future to chill out with friends
3
Checked this place out because there were a lot of people there. Food was ok but small portions. I would get any of the single tacos vs the Al pastor. Al pastor comes with two tacos and is cheaper but they are extremely small and not worth the price. Carnitas on the other hand was amazing. One taco but the pork belly was delicious
3
Pricey as everything in this popular night spot is but fast efficient service and your basic mexican options. Good vibe and a hit with the locals as it was full and a queue to get a place
4
We came here for a couple of drinks recently, quite a good atmosphere and location is amazing, particularly at night as it overlooks Marina bay and the MBS hotel.We arrived fairly late and kitchen was closing so we just had some snacks which were good. Staff were friendly and overall service very good
1
Small portions of tasteless fast-food served up at extortionate prices by disinterested staff - there are numerous far better places to eat nearby
4
Staff is attentive n helpful despite the place is very crowded on my visit. Will back again in future
4
The food at Senor Taco was excellent. My girlfriend was craving Mexican food, and she said that this was the real deal
5
Senor Tacos serves the lightest & most delicious chicken fajitas, cooked your before your eyes at the open air kitchen. Quite amazing! Superb staff throughout, including the superb kitchen staff.Excellent Colombian band & local DJs play inside (Bachata, Salsa, Merengue). Top dance lessons (Tuesday Bachata, Wednesday Salsa) are on early evening. Great crowd, drinks, dancing & chicken fajitas! Congratulations & thank you
4
I stopped for some tacos. I ordered the Al Pastor tacos - they were pretty good - among the more authentic flavours of the Mexican restaurants I've tried, although the meat was excessively salty... maybe they wanted me to buy more drinks. I ate outdoors around 5pm, so I don't have anything to say about the nightlife. Even in the middle of the afternoon, it's loud as hell outside. Pretty obnoxious atmosphere, in general, which is just a symptom of spending time at Clark Quay, but the food at Senor Taco is good enough that I would come back... IF I happened to be at Clark Quay. The margarita seemed fairly authentic
1
We ordered tacos and quesadilla for takeout. The portion was pathetic, especially the Classic Beef Quesadilla. It was just a few pieces of beef and cheese. Plain. Tasted bland. And it was around $10 for that miserable quesadilla.With such pathetic portions, high prices and average taste, I won't think of ever setting foot in Senor Taco
4
Ordered a pork burrito and beef quesadilla, both were tasty and delicious, but a tad too oily (hands were dripping with oil as we ate them
3
Waiters did not know the menu well. Smokers all around even though smoking was not allowed. Portions v small for some items
5
This place is a hub for youth and live music , dance and ambience , the outlet is located in clarke quay , which is good place for night clubing and drinks
4
We were here for dinner, food was delicious!! We particularly enjoyed the enchiladas and ceviche.The place has daily promotions so look put for those. Mains had happy hour pricing before 8pm when we went. Later in the night, the place comes further alive with the live band and patrons on the dancefloo
3
The music was so loud we couldn't talk. I realise this is a place on Clarke Quay and they are trying to be trendy, but we were eating at 6:30 not drinking at midnight
4
Had a great time at seÃ±or taco. We had the fajitas (really delicious at medium rare), the fish taco (half priced! Well worth to get it during taco Tuesdays) and the chicken flautas (?). The latter was perfect as it wasn't too heavy. The servers were really attentive as well.
2
I was there on a Tuesday night and this waiter doesn't know what he is doing. I ordered a bunch of food. He never even listed it in a paper being over confident in taking the order. Ending up serving me a spicy chicken wing which he thought I never ordered. Dude! I literally bite the celery already on the dish yet you served it on the other table telling me that it doesn't belong to me. And it ended up that no chicken wing was served at the end of my meal. Next thing I asked is cutleries. I literally asked cutleries for like 3 times. You guys need to buckle up on your service. I'm giving a 1 star because of bad service, dirty tables, late and dirty cutleries which i had to wipe. Not worth to spend your money.
5
If anyone loves salsa/bachata or meringue. This is the place to go. It's small and cozy. As well as a live band playing throughout the night. Great people and salsa dancers all around.
3
Food is good as always, portion is normal, service is okay however it is quite pricey for such kind of food. Give it a try if you really craving for Mexican food
3
My husband and I had a meal here, after arriving in Singapore quite late at night. We were pleased that they were open and still serving food around 10 pm, when we got in. This place really has more focus, at least at that time of day, on the dance club / bar, rather than the food. But, when it's late, you sort of take what you can get -- and after months of travel away from home, some Mexican-style food was quite appealing. Our food was decent, however. My husband had several tacos which he said were good and my burrito was tasty. We also ordered chips, with salsa and guac -- although the salsa never arrived (we weren't charged, either). Portions were very generous. It is expensive -- as it a lot of food in Singapore -- but perhaps even above the average, given the popular and hectic location. Service was distracted, but it was very busy and our food was delivered quickly. My only complaint with respect to the meal itself was that I was, somewhat bizarrely, informed that they had no water and I could not get any. Given the location, this place is pretty much as you would expect. But, it's tasty food, open late, and has a fun atmosphere. If you're in the right mood, it could be a fun spot
3
After wandering around Clarke Quay for 15-20 minutes with a work colleague we decided to have dinner here.Service was extremely prompt and we had drinks quite quickly. The food also arrived quite quickly after ordering. The food was OK.After finishing our meal we left having realised that this is a bit of a cross between a fast food place and a restaurant. Probably much the same as a lot of places in the area
4
The guy who started this now small Singaporean chain is from Monterrey, Mexico, and they've got the goods! Far from a true taco stand in 'el zocalo' but to find quick, tasty food like this in the middle of SE Asia is a gem. Ice cold beers, quick service, and prime location. Hola
4
The Red Chicken Quesadilla is really good if you love CHEESE! The place is nice to chill and there are even live band performances if you stay late enough. Would definitely visit the place again
2
Was surprised to see that my taco order was only 1 taco and cost $8 and my quesadilla was the same size as the taco. Food was just average
1
Great location with excellent atmosphere but downhill from there. Food was overpriced and very ordinary, meat was almost puréed and cheese resembled the cheddar you would get on top of a McDonald's burger. Added to that was they wanted $15 for a stubby of beer. Avoid at all costs !!
3
Small space. Be aware that sometime they have dance class indoor and probably get too noisy.Drinks were pricy I thought. A pint of lager was 16.9 SGD
5
Helpful service, enjoyable atmosphere and delicious carne. The chips and guacamole were small. The steak sandwich and quesadillas were delightful. Kids loved the festive atmosphere.
5
The joy and energy of Señor Taco is absolutely outstanding and doesn't have any comparison on Singapore island. Great tacos, fajitas, drinks and most importantly life band music directly from Mexico
2
Went here for dinner after reading reviews. Had Grande Quesadillas, Chicken Fajitas, Al Pastor. Very basic Mexican and not tasty at all. Very oily and very average quality of meats. Not much flavour and my Quesadillas are 100% times better. Venue was great and music was amazing. Over all very under par for Food in Singapore or any were else in the world.
4
Actually there is more space outside than inside due to the live band.After 22:00 there is a band playing before it is mainly latin music.Service isn't really up to task - not very attentive - once called they are very friendly.If you do not call them they will pass by several times without asking if you want something more.Food was very tasty and fresh - it was also quite fast.Beef Quesadilla, Shell Taco and green chilli was very nice although not too large of a portion - but correct as it should be.Recommend the Fish Ceviche - very nice!till 22:00 they have 1 for 1 Margarita - well prepared, very good!In all a nice place to have some mexican food and listen to latin music - small tables and a bar with some room to dance.You may also sit outside and watch the scenery with plenty activity.Can recommend the place, prices are according to singapore standards and reasonable - only the beef burrito i find a bit overpriced although it is quite a larger portion
4
Living in Europe for the last 17 years, I have been disappointed by many so called Mexican restaurants that end of truly making only Tex-Mex food. However, Senor Taco was a true delightful discovery. Their tacos al pastor tasted just as they do in Mexico. Didn't try much else, but I would definitely go back. Their only down side is that their mojitos taste watery, so stick to beer or sodas
5
Located in the heart of Clarke Quay, Senor Taco serves delicious Mexican food with a great ambience
4
Food was tasty. Taco portions are very small. But mains are a good size. Very much a bar design with high tables and high seating. Not really a kid friendly design. But staff are pleasant and accommodating.
4
Tacos are nice, but staff are somewhat clueless about service and can't do recommendations.
Don't order the mains!!
5
This was our evening bar on a recent visit. Great vibe, great staff, fantastic food and amazing cocktails. Great value for money. The resident band are superb. We visited on a Tuesday evening for a salsa dance lesson
4
Great night food was pretty good vibes were great and some cool drinks on the menu little bit expensive to drink but the entertainment is great so it's worth it.
3
Food is pretty mediocre, portions are small, chicken was dry. Entertainment was good they had a nice cuban band with salsa dancers all over.
3
The service was really good, everyone is friendly although you might find the waitress keep on eating their snacks behind the cashier. Food experience was mixed, ceviche was good, as well as the tenderloin, but not the chicken burrito.
5
The food and atmosphere is awesome, the best carnitas in the world along with tacos al pastor. Enjoy
4
6 people several dishes and nothing to complain about. Besides the price. But that is Singapore at the turist hotspots i guess. Really authentic all way round. The interior, the staff, the music and of cause the food and drinks. We were seated inside that will give you the full experience
4
I ordered the tacos on a tuesday, and there is an ongoing 50% off on tuesdays. Had a mojito as well. The tacos were mixed. I liked the Al Pastor (I hope I spelt it right), but there was one Chicken Fajita that was too salty. I liked the Vegetarian one as well. Staff were friendly and helpful. When I went, there was a dance class going on in the inner restaurant (they have seats outside as well), I'm not sure if this is a regular thing. It did not disturb me, my friend liked to watch, but some people might not
1
Ate with friends and were all disappointed. All meals were so small with a see through slice of meat. Poor quality for a holiday setting and far too expensive. We would advice people to have a walk at Clarke quay but all the bars are a rip off for food and drink. We were gullible as just arrived so did not have our bearings. There are lots of other choices for eating and drinking in the city that are much better with a realistic cost.
4
Great location, good margaritas and best of all they have fresh corn tortilla and authentic taste This is a good Mexican option if you are in the Clark quay area (best in Clark ) but they are very expensive , then again Clark quay area is very expensive being a main tourist attraction I think the Mexican food at Robertson quay is a good alternative for the same price ..
5
I'm from Mexico and I can say that these tacos are delicious, local flavors with spicy salsas. Also excellent service !
3
Singapore has many more mexican restuarants why waste time and money trying this one. Add to that small portions. Maybe they know if they serve appropriate quantity people will figure out how bland the food is.
1
We had the misfortune of sitting down and eating....we each had one mouthful of the nachos and left never tasted worse. The cheese was synthesized cheese and the guacamole was liquid....seriously DO NOT eat there.
1
Current band is a disaster .... no life.. monotonous singing ... food was good. Loved the previous band because of which we returned
5
Good Mexican food asking with a good drinks menu and a lovely location. Salsa lessons available also if you get bored
4
Nice food and the cocktails are amazing. As everything in Singapore a little expensive but it's worth it.
5
I had the tacos which were really good but I really loved the Coronaritas! awesome!! Also a great place for people watching! Clark Quay is a great place to visit!
4
Great food. Had the burritos and guacamole and chips. Food was fairly expensive but I guess most food is in Singapore! Liked the sauce selections on the tables
3
We ordered a Quesadilia and Veggie Chorizo with 2 lemon ice tea. The Quesidilia was nice but the veggie chorizo wasnt great. the size of the helping is small and we werent full even after spending sgd 30.60 on the above mentioned order. Location is nice - and music is good too
5
Senor Taco dishes up nice authentic mexican food in generous measures...it was a great location, right in the middle of Clarke Quay with so much hustle and bustle...and with such good food to go with, all in all was a great dinner experience. Food was fresh and the hot sauce was so good; they even serve a mexican soda which I tried out !!
5
I love and enjoy the saucy salsa dance night with live music and great Magarita and food :)
Do try the awesome Guacamole!!!!
5
This place in clark quay district is the best mexican tacos in town you feel that you are eating tacis like mexico great fiod great attention snd good value offer it is a must in town
4
Had a recommendation to try ....food was excellent and we decided to sit outside. It was kinda expensive overall but hey it is singapore and clark quay
4
Located in the heart of Clarke Quay, a hotspot for restaurants, cafes and bars, Senor Taco offers good Mexican food. The tacos are generously covered with chili, unlike many places which are stingy on that. I like the pulled pork too.
4
Tasty food,varied menu,reasonable prices.Staff were friendly,efficient and helpful.
Music super loud but great atmosphere.
Would recommend.
1
It was the worst Mexican food I ever tasted. It was just gooey and tasteless. I wish I didn't waste 30 dollars on a plate of nachos. My advice never have food from here
4
My girl friend has been raving about SeÃ±or Taco's Coronarita for months and I didn't get to try it until recently. I must say that the raves were completely founded! Couldn't think of a better way to spend a token GNO than with a tall glass or two of their mean 'ritas! And that's not all that this famous joint in Clarke Quay has to offer. Their food is just as palatable - from tacos, to quesadillas, and all the way to some of the usual Mexican treats you can think of, this restaurant serves it up with a lot of great taste at a price that's reasonably okay - for Singapore. If you're a fan of the sexy salsa (or is it bachata?), then you will love this place all the more because when the clock strikes 9, the dance floor is fired up by a lot of sexy sways and gyrations by the dancing patrons! Definitely coming back a few more times.:
4
It was my first time to try Senor Taco, and I was told by those who had been there before to not bother with the lackluster burritos there - to just go straight for the tacos.So that's what I did, and I was not disappointed. The tacos were great - particularly the green chili & pork chicharon.I was hoping to have a Negra Modelo, and this is indeed on the menu, but I was told it was actually unavailable and the only dark beer available was San Miguel Dark - a poor substitute in my opinion
5
Located in the lively walking street behind the Clarke Quay main thoroughfare, we found this place! Serving pretty authentic and delicious Mexican style street food on one side and then a table menu on the other side! The best I have tasted anywhere! And I've been to Mexico! The staff were great, willing to have a laugh and were so helpful! Drinks were also good! Worth a try, big thumbs up from me!
4
I visited senor taco while honeymooning in singapore and i would like to say that i absolutely loved the food and the flavours infused were completely lip smacking! Being vegans both of us ,that is me and my husband were quite shilly- shally about our eating out but stumbling upon this place in the heart of clarke quay that happens to be the partying hub and houses variety of restaurants and nightclubs,our hunger pangs were completely satiated courtesy the amiable gentleman , an indian named Akash who served us and having met him we felt so homely in foreign land and all in all we really had a gala time so much so we visited it thrice on consecutive nights. I am sure their non vegan menu will be loved by you as much and talking of its Singapore outlet this place is definitely worth a shot
4
Enjoyed my dinner at Señor Taco Clarke Quay. The Carnitas was amazing - had it with the very spicy sauce. Also enjoyed Pacifico beer. Service was friendly and attentive. Sat outside to enjoy the fresh evening air as well as the crowd walking by.
5
Live music after around nine, good mexican food, good drinks (Mojito jugs especially!). What else would you need? Senor Tacos offers eithers either indoor, outdoor or take away seating. Better choice is just to step in and enjoy.
3
This is a good place to drink margaritas and people watch. The food is OK at best and usually comes from the takeaway bar across the way. Good atmosphere and decent service but don't expect great cuisine.
3
Was looking was Mexican food in Clark Quay & just happened to be by the place. We ordered 2 burritos. The food was ok, not great to the extent of Mexican food we get in the states, but ok compared to being in Asian sub continent. The stuffing was good, quite filling but 30 SGD with coke per person, too expensive, considering the ambience & food quantity. Nothing extra ordinary
2
Felt like a schmuck paying S$17.43 for a 12 oz beer when customers few feet away, at the place next door, were paying S$6.00they charged me 14.90 for one corona plus 1.49 service fee and 1.04 tax for a total price of 17.43, then I noticed the place immediately next door advertising 12 oz beer (Asahi) for 6.00 including tax and serviceI did not see the price for beer in the menu I ordered from, but I did see a large glass display fridge filled with coronas from top to bottom, a practice typically indicative of a promotional item. Later, as I was leaving, I noticed the 14.90 on the wall next to the cooler, at an angle not visible from where I was sitting. So it looks like they thought of this setup very carefully, in what what looks like a tourist trapThe sad thing was, I actually enjoyed the food, but got heart burns after the bill. Being from Houston , I can say the food had an authentic taste, but was not as good as Taco Cabana, for twice the price of Pappasito's In Singapore, you don't have many options for Mexican food, and this place is definitely an option, and I will probably be back for the food, not sure about the beer: no one likes to be taken advantage of.5 stars for service and location, 3 stars for food and -1 star for the questionable price practice So I am giving 2 starsI suggest to management to charge around 12 net for coronas, and 10 during happy hour till 7 , in that case my rating would be 4
1
This is one these Singapore joints where they feel it's actually OK to rip you off with rubbish food Expensive pricing and smiling service Not a pleasant experience at all
5
Well I have to say that being from the US I was having a hard time going without an authentic Mexican meal. I have been in Singapore a couple months and am so glad I found this place. The food is fantastic and if you can believe it I'd have to say the best that I have eaten. In my home state Oklahoma a great meal is around just about every corner, Mexican is my favorite and I'm really picky about it. Senor Taco is now my favorite place to eat in SG. Cant wait to go bac
1
The prices are high – even for SG standards … but Let’s not forget you are paying for the view along the river here. But when I pay high prices I still expect value. Staff all seemed to concentrate on hooking in the next client off the street. So as soon as we were seated we were ignored.Drinks – with 2 A and 2 C – we wanted just 2 beers – but they tried to push us into buying a bucket of beers… no thanks was the far too obvious answer.The menu had all the options you would expect.The food more than disappointing. Lacking spicy and flavourful way I know that (OS) “Mexican” restaurants can deliver. Toned down for local tastes perhaps? Certainly short cuts in the preparation of the sauces that should take hours to simmer and develop flavours that were lacking here.But the killer was the service: not slow but far too quickly. HOW could they possibly serve enchiladas in that amount of time? Before my first bite I knew – trying to cut through the pancake it was rubbery and tough. You only get that consistency by heating flour products in a microwave – yuck!The first bite confirmed my suspicions. Microwave heated pre prepared meals. I tried to get management’s attention – but all 3 had they back to me – preferring instead to suck the next victim into their web. So I gave up. We had other places to go and clearly someone knew what a disaster the food prep was..Instead I leave this award – after 30 years and 30+ visits to Singapore this is my very worst dining experience in Singapore - ever. Poor service, high prices, and worst of all low quality food showing a lack of care and love – from initial prep to final re-heating
1
Just dont come to this place!!! So over priced, its insane.We paid 24 bucks for 2 tiny tacos, and it is really not worth it
2
The food taste was bland, the portion was tiny and the presentation unappetizing. Not worth the price at all. Had it not for the ambience i would not hesitate to give it one sta
4
Me and my girlfriends had a wonderful mexican dinner. Loving the authentic taste of tacos and fish tacos, superb. The service is good, and I strongly recommend, come and try it.
4
Small but cosy and lively, with good band and dance crowd. Responsive and efficient service. Good drink selection. Wide selection of imported beers which are pricey but ok for Clarke Quay. The carnitas are reasonably priced, I enjoyed the bellypork carnita.
3
We came from Indonesia and decided to try some mexican food here. Pass by this restaurant and get our dinner here. We didn't know there was event like tap dance, etc.
And our view was rite near a fountain. It was nice
4
Very good Mexican food. With live music.
We had al pastor tacos which were a bit small but very very similar to ones you find in Mexico. They serve also Mexican beers and cocktails. The mujito was great.
Very recommend (!)
1
Overprice and didn't taste good at all. I would never go back. The meat was awful. Nice staff though and good music. Would do for a beer but nothing else.
2
I grabbed dinner at senor taco one night. The portions were small and the food was bland. We ended up paying around SGD80 for 2 dishes and one sangria . I didn't find the place worthwhile and wouldn't recommend it to anybody
5
This surprising little Mexican restaurant tucked into the plaza by clarke quay could not be better. I popped in for quick bite, and decided to pair it with a frozen mojito. This was on a Friday night. Whilst enjoying my veggie burrito , a Latin band started up. Unexpected surpris
4
I have yet to eat here but it's always a family stopping point for the margaritas, tequila, and best of all for the kids, virgin margaritas. Service is very good and the presentation is always great. Definitely worth pre-dinner drinks, and the menu looks amazing. We'll be back for drinks and hopefully dinner one day
1
Over priced food. Taco had measly fillings. We tried hosting Tacos Tuesday there once and regretted it. Also the restaurant refuses to serve guest free tap water
5
the place is at Clarke quay the area in general is lovely, a lot of out door bars and restaurants. senor taco plays cool rnb music in the outdoor seating area and a live band is indoors the food is seriously delicious tried almost everything :) quesadillas were amazing, the tacos, nachos and the burrito even the mojito was real good served in a small jug. the waitress was very friendly too; the atmosphere and food all in all is a great package a must try while ther
5
They've added a lot of different stuff to their menu over the years but the original sets are the very best, especially the Al Pastors.
3
The Burritos and sizzler's were really nice, but the drinks were average. I found this place to be over priced!
4
Tacos + a Corona is perfection after a full night out! Really nice restaurant in Clarke Quay. Really nice staff!
4
A tad expensive, but authentic Mexican. The flavours, ambience and music gave a complete Mexican feel. We tried the burrito with a mojito and surprisingly the drink was more memorable than the food. The Mojito was top class. The food was good too.
4
After 45mts of awe inspiring marina bay cruise, SeÃ±or Taco was just the place to unwind and get the evening @ Clarke Quay started....We ordered chicken tacos but the highlight of the place was CoronoRita...lovely concoction of Corona and Margarita. We sat at the bar and enjoyed watching the bar tender mix funky unique drinks...was quite an education -:) The Latina band started around 9.30pm and quickly set the floor on fire. What I loved the most was fabulous graffiti all over...created warm and fun ambience
4
We visited Senor Taco just off Orchard Road. Best chicken burrito I have ever eaten and fantastic margaritas. Could have stayed for hours drinking margaritas. Really enjoyed the informal vibe of the outdoor bar seating watching the world go by. Husband had quesadillas which were a bit small for him, probably better suited to entree. Would certainly go back for another. Serve
1
This is not a resturant! We paid $250 for a family of five, we ate with plastic knives and forks and out of plastic baskets. The food quality is less than what you would get at a food court. We are very easy going, we enjoy our meal, pay our bill and go back to our hotel. This time, we paid our bill and it was so bad we had to say something and asked to speak to the manager. The assistant manager told us he was sorry for our experience and let us know that he tells his friends not to come here. Don't waste your money going here
4
The owner is Mexican, they have great tequila choices and the food was excellent. They even had a Mariachi band that had real latino musicians playing all kinds of Latin music. Great take! If you are Jonesing for Mexican, head here. You do pay for it, but if you need some Mexican....gotta go. Outdoor seating as well
4
Came here because of a recommendation. I was there in the evening. I ordered their tacos and a strawberry margherita. Their tacos were delicious but too small for the price. The tortilla was extremely thin and light. Not filling. Because I sat outside, I saw a performance next door, which was ladies from the persian restaurant belly dancing. They drew in a crowd
2
I used to go to this restaurant when it was in chijmes square, it was high quality (authentic) mexican food- great service nice chef and some really traditional Mexican dishes. However, it has really gone down since, you can clearly see that there has been some cut costs and instead of a nice place to sit and have a drink it has gone to a more "party" place. The only thing that remains good is their Habanero sauc
5
best food had a good meal and met friends staff good go here for mighty dish . plenty to eat on dish
3
The food and the ambience looks much better then the taste - kept me wishing I had gone someplace else for my meal.
4
We got there at night and the atmosphere was really nice. Mexican music, not too loud (like some other places around) and not quiet at all. People dancing salsa inside and being more relaxed outside. We had different types of Mexican beer and ordered four tacos, which were nice, though the chicken fajita taco was quite tasteless.I enjoyed my time and would go back to try other food on the menu

The food at Senor Taco was very good, quite authentic but pricey like nearly everywhere in the touristy Clarke Quay area. Service was prompt and efficient. The taco's were small but delicious. We tried 5 different ones and enjoyed them all. The street food platter was delicious but not what we expected. A massive bowl of corn chips and chicarone with 3 dipping sauces. The restaurant is incredibly noisy. The music is loud, like night club loud so don't go there for dinner and a conversation. They ate very quick to get the food out so dropping past for a quick snack is a great option as well
2
Worse taco I have ever had, didn't look anything like the menu, didn't look like a taco! Very greasy in fact soaked in it it from the meat. Quesidilla just as bad, not a genuine item. There are so many good Mexican outlets in Singapore so try them before here
5
I love Mexican food and this place has the best one in SG. Dishes as Tacos al Pastor taste quite authentic. Staff is very friendly and this place has a great atmosphere with live band on many days a week. Space is a bit small and prices are on the higher end, but if you like Mexican, I recommend this place
1
My friend and I ordered one of the mains to share and portion was ridiculously small. RIDOCULOUSLY.and the price was also therefore unacceptable. We were so close to just walking away. And the greasiness of what we have was unbelievable. Food like that can in no way be served
3
A nice little place, and good tacos.Very close to the ones you get in MexicoThe only downside is the price they are quite expensive, this is of course on relation of what can of meal you can get for the same money somewhere else.An average experience overall
5
We travel often to Mexico and being from Arizona we are accustomed to tacos almost every week. We met the owner of Senior Taco last night and had a few shots of tequila with him and heard his story on how he launched the brand. We were at the Clarke Quay store and he led us to the indoor restaurant to listen to the band. The musicians were from Mexico and South America and played some wonderful Latin music. Don't miss this one
5
Fantastic! Dance lessons if you go early, dancing and live music. One of a very few REAL Latin dance clubs in SE Asia. I go here every time i get to Singapore. Good food, great atmosphere, friendly locals and regulars. Great place to dance and enjoy the Latin vibe. You can actually speak Spanish here and people know what you are saying and answer! Wonderful
4
Walked into this restaurant after a long walk around the city. Not bad at all! Had a chicken fajita and a chicharron taco. Pettite sized, but very tasty. All and all a good value experience.
1
The place definitely seems like a very good one from outside but trust me the food that they serve is not even close to good. The quality of food is bad, the portions are really small and seems like the kitchen is run by amateurs.
4
We went their on Saturday with office colleagues. Ambience is nice, place is small and cozy but just good enough to entertain a small group.Good food and live latin music and staff very friendly
5
This small restaurant has the most amazing food and live band. My kids enjoyed and so did me and my wife. Its definitely a place to be repeated again and again.
2
I love trying nachos wherever I go on holidays, doesn't matter if it's Asia, Europe or Australia, it's a must for me. This place has a limited many compared to another Mexican restaurants in Singapore. Their so called Nachos are simple tortilla chips with spicy beef, and that's eat, no sour cream nor guacamole!!! If you want guac you need to order tortilla chips and guacamole, they don't even give you the option to add it at your own beef nachos. Nachos without guacamole and/or sour cream is like a computer without Internet... Useless
2
I really love mexican food, however this place was disappointing.. I tried the Corona-Rita which is a glass of margarita and a bottle of Corona in one, mostly just Corona and not enough Margarita(the margarita comes from a slush machine) defiantly not worth 26 dollars.The portions are quite small, for example the Baja fish taco has a small piece of fried fish in it, while it should have been minimum 2 pieces after my opinion. I wish the guacamole was a bit more spicy and the chips a bit more salty. Honestly I couldn't taste much difference between the baja fish taco and the chicken fajitas which is not a good thing. Very blend taste.Defiantly not a place to go solo, a lot of groups of people and most of them, including the staff giving pity looks.Besides that the staff is very friendly and helpful.I will not come back as I think the place is overcrowded and overrated, but if you do decide to go I recommend to book in advance
5
Surprised my girlfriend with all our close friends and proposed at Senor Taco Clarke Quay itself with the help of the awesome staff. Kudos to the Restaurant Manager, Luis RodrÃ­guez, for going out of the way to facilitate the plan! Had dinner and drinks with everyone and all of them loved the authentic Mexican food served. Will definitely be coming back and would like to recommend this place to anyone
3
Good setting however, the portion sizes are way too small for a casual cafe type outlet. I liked the servers but the cooks on line looked a bit pressurized and the orders prepared were very ordinary.. I guess the orders to cook were a handful. anyways due to me catchng up with family after a long time we went on to the next dining..I also didnt see my next tables ordering any food either but just drinks.. may be its more a beverage focussed restaurant
4
Missing Mexican food and thought we'll give this place a try. They have 1 for 1 Tuesday Taco, which is worth it, else your bill will be even more. Generally the tacos are tasty, but I prefer the burrito, it's packed full of refried beans and chicken is tasty too, love it! Al Pastor Taco was probably their recommended taco, but I prefer the Chicken Alambre and Baja Fish. Tried their Hot buffalo wings - Alitas Habanero - not to my liking. It's saucy and tabasco sour only. Strawberry Margaritas is mediocre to me.Pricey food, but taste wise, good. Feels like in those casual dining Mexican cafes in USA, but much more worth it there, for sure
5
walked pass and smelt the freshness of the herbs and the chillis and had to buy some soft tacos. I ordered the pork belly and the chicken. They were cooked right in front of me on a big open grill. Everything was fresh and they tasted delicious, I could of ate more but was in a hurry for a meeting. Will be back again for sure. Also I thought $7 a taco was ok for singapore.
5
It was the best Mexican food I have ever tasted it was divine and it had a liv band and I would recommend the quesadilla it tasted superb
5
A nice small restaurant in the middle of the busy and happening Clarke Qyay which serves some amazing Mexican food and nice cocktails. we ordered some Quesadillas, Burritos, Guacamole etc and everything were excellent. We preferred sitting outside in streets as it is more happening and loved the ambiance. We ordered their signature CoronaRita which is a Margarita with a bottle of Corona on it and simply loved the drink. Pricing was also very reasonable
4
managed to get a table for 9 of us as we were walking around after dinner to find a place to celebrate Christmas. service was quick and friendly. Good recommendation from the waiter. he did jokingly mention about tipping him, knowing he is a foreign worker like myself and unable to celebrate Christmas with family and have to work on this special occasion. tip him when settling bill as he fully deserve it!will be back again with empty stomach to try out their food besides nachos and margarita
2
Our Mexican acquaintance said they had OK tacos here. Having had authentic Mexican food our entire lives, we trusted this source. I had seen on the internet they had wheat flour and corn tacos. I wanted wheat due to allergy to corn but FOUR wait staff told us they could only do corn for tacos. So, while I did not want a caramelo, it came on a wheat tortilla. Two servers asked me if I wanted it medium or well- done and I said "medium" and when it came it looked so pitiful on the tortilla, like a sad piece of thick liver. It was medium and I was anxious to devour it but it had NO flavor tho it was tender. It had an unusual odor. I hate to waste food so I asked my husband to eat it. He tried but could not. His meal was OK, beef enchiladas. I was up most of the night with indigestion, it happens w bad meat and chewy squid, so I avoid squid. The wait staff is friendly and beer good, but because of that sad meal of inedible, questionable "beef" we will not go back. I thought the 85% of caramelo left in the basket was a message to the chef but no wait staff commented.
4
Went here on a recommendation from a local friend, and found the food to be delicious, especially the guacamole, and "house recommended" pork & fish tacos -- really tasty flavors! We were lucky to choose to go on Tuesday evening which is 1 for 1 tacos, highly recommended to make dinner even better value. Also, unlike other reviewers we had good service (we sat inside). The *only* reason I didn't rate as excellent is their unfortunate policy to not serve tap water, and charge $5/bottle for normal 500ml bottled water (and other standard soft drinks). I can only guess that they make their margins on the drinks...but if they could revise this policy it would be our perfect Mexican in Singapore
5
I have to say it, I am Mexican living in Europe for the past 6 years and I have been traveling within Europe and Asia frequently.... the closes thing to a real Mexican restaurant I had found were in Madrid (Spain) and one in Shanghai which no longer exists. But now I have to give it to Señor Taco in Singapore (located in Clarke Quay), simply the best Tacos I have tried outside Mexico. If you are in for good Pastor-Bistec Tacos or Quesadillas, then you have to go there while in Singapore. The chilli sauces are also great, real and spicy (depending on the sauce) they also have guacamole-sauce. The menu had many many mexican goodies (Carnitas, Pozole i think, Chiles en Nogada, etc...) things that you rarely find in the mainstream "mexican restaus" outside Mexico. I went there twice over my weekend! (it was that good). I seriously recommend the place. And service was really good, the people working there were definitely nice, quick and helpful
4
Visited Senor Taco late on a Friday night. They have a decent spread of mexican food available from their menu. We ordered tacos, enchiladas, and the guacamole. The enchiladas and tacos were a bit small, but tasty. The guacamole was also very good, but came in a HUGE portion. Don't miss out on these when you visit. They had live music playing classic songs, with a few mainstream artists thrown in (Juanes, Mana, Santana). It's a bit loud inside with the band, but they also have outside seating so you can people watch
2
Seemed like a good place to sit for a meal. Wrong. Ignored by staff, eventually when someone realised we were there wrote our order on a scrap of paper, and then we waited and waited. Drinks (bottle of beer) eventually arrives with my partners meal. After more time her drink and my meal. My meal is not what I ordered but I am starving by now and I can't be bothered making a fuss to people that are not really interested in just a little bit of customer service. The bill took 24 seconds to reach my hand from the moment I asked for it - we timed it just for a laugh. Bye bye to $60 and the knowledge that this was the worst restaurant we've encountered so far in Singapore. Congratulations Senor Taco
3
We ordered burritos and chicken tacos, they were nice. The service was great and the staff were friendly
4
There's a good range of touristy and authentic dishes with an emphasis on soft corn tacos, which would be great if they weren't so expensive. It's not cooked extensively enough to get the real flavours of Mexico but the baja taco and the pirata were seriously some of the best Mexican I've had in Asia. Combo meals can help with the high cost if you're drinking. Nice outdoor seating under the canopy
3
We went here to celebrate my birthday. We had margaritas and they were good. But nachos was just average. I think there are other bars around with better food.
4
Guacamole extremely flavorful, chips crips and fresh. Beer cold, love that they had Pacifico. Fish taco superb. Everyone in our party was pleased with what they ordered....lots of flavor. Got to watch the belly dancing next door. Sat outside. Fun restaurant. Great service.
5
I moved to Singapore 4 years ago, and I must say that this place really makes me feel like home. The food has real Mexican taste, service is great and friendly, and the place has a really good vibe. I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the mood for Mexican food, some tequila and a great time.2 thumbs up
3
Craving for taco, me & best friends decided to dine at Senor Taco @ Clarke Quay. We had alambre de pollo, pedro and ribeye. All good, only the size a bit too small for us who were hungry. So, we topped up with 1 burito share between us. We preferred tacos over burito. Pls use all the sauce to add the flavor.Choose the table outside coz it's more entertaining. If you r lucky, one can enjoy bellie dancer from next door restaurant
5
I have become a regular customer for this mexican food place. Their signature dish is the Tacos al Pastor, let me tell you that this tacos are 95 percent the same as the original ones you can have in any of the best tacos places in Mexico City. This place is owned by a mexican guy and the chef is also mexican. Recommend this place to everyone, should try the pastor tacos and must have a michelada mexican style which is a beer poured on a glass with lemon juice and spices
5
I have to say that this are the best tacos out side Mexico . The tacos al pastor were so good.But not only the tacos, the service was very good, the menu is big and there is a lot of different kind of tacos, but all of them very tradicional Mexican Food.So if you are looking for a true Mexican Restaurant in Singapore look no more and go straight to Señor Taco
1
We were keen to have some Mexican tapas and margarita. We missed the happy hour yesterday so we came back the next day for the happy hour drinks. We ended up ordering some drinks recommended by the waitress that weren't included in the happy hour deal (only realised that when we got the bill!). The waitress knew that we wanted happy hour drinks! The worse things were that the food was below average and the cocktails were horrible! What a shameful tourist trap
4
Senor Taco has teally good mexican food, we have tried the burritos, nachos, tacos, fajitas and also the margaritas. All of them were well prepared and were delicious. howevere the price wise is almost double of what you would pay in a normal Asian restaurant. the portion of burritos is good but for tacos the portion is really small and not enough for one person. For 30+ $ you get a huge fajitas with 5 pieces of tortilas, which is really tasty and delucious but well is expensive. but is enough for two people with an additional set of tortillas
1
Was attracted in here by the waitress offering a 1 for 1 deal. The food took 45 mins to arrive (it's only tacos) despite their being only a couple of other tables eating. When the food came it was awful and tiny portions. The bill then came and we were told we weren't eligible for the 1 for 1 despite that being the reason we came in. We even specifically asked for the 1 for 1 meals. A terrible experience from a restaurant that plays on tourists and no repeat business. Won't be going back and would recommend it. There are many better places at Clarke quay
1
Wandered in by chance while looking for a fun date weeknight option, and had one of our worst dining experiences. The food is terribly over priced - the Nachos were just bad, limited toppings and the flavours didn't come together. The veggie Burritos were okay but not something you couldn't have off a food cart. The cocktails were so-so, but my partner had a house beer and really liked it. Paying 70++ for very average food is definitely not my idea of any dinner, let alone a date night
5
Went to senir tango and took advantage of the happy hour and liked the Mexican beers tried the quasadillas were hot fresh and tasty but expensive but for sure would go back again
4
Great tacos from the chief chef Luis. Rayan was the best waiter and brought me and my friends happiness. Quite expensive for the amount of food you get but still great taste.
4
Perfect place for a cold Pacifico and Taco's. We always stop by when in Singapore to watch the world and enjoy a cold beer.
4
Only went here because it was late and the place we were looking to eat had shut... Glad to say it was a decent dining experience backed up with terrific cocktails. The food was your normal Mexican fare but tasty and fresh washed down with nicest Margaritas.. Sweet as ! Reasonable price I felt .. So if you pitch up late and need food to soak up your beer.. No hesitation about recommending Mr Taco. Good stuff 
5
As a Mexican living in Asia I am always looking for Mexican comfort food when I travel. A Mexican friend that lives in Singapore recommended us this place and we loooved it. She told us that the owner of this place is also Mexican, so as you can imagine the taste of the tacos and the salsas here was really similar to the Tacos in Mexico. We order Tacos al pastor with Mexican beer, yuuummm! The prices are a high yes, but then again so is everything else in Singapore
1
Bad service.Waitress did not know anything about the dishes. Needed to get another waiter to tell us about the dishes. Due to one of us allergic too gluten we chose dishes that contained corn tortillas.The waitress assured us that the dishes contained no gluten.In fact we were served the wheat tortillas in stead, result was a severe allergic reaction that came a few hours after leaving the restaurant.I got my main dish 20 minutes before my wife.Bear heavily over priced, even for Chimes 
5
i have been to the clarke quay location twice now, and i must say that it's nice to sit outside at the tables where you can smoke, drink, and eat, and watch the passers by. the food, especially the tacos, although small, are some of the best most authentic that i've had in asia. price is pretty good for clarke quay also: 4 tacos and a beer for $20. the service has also been very good and friendly both times as well. and they have sexy music videos on the big screen to watch in between the prostitutes passing by, haha
4
This was my second visit to the restaurant, and it was just as good as the first. We ordered soft tacos with chicken. The guacamole, salsa, refried beans tasted delicious. They don't serve crispy tacos.. yayyy…. They had 3 different types of hot sauce: from mild jalapeño to the seriously hot habanero. We had ice-cold corona beer to subdue the heat.The restaurant is located in Clarke Quay, one of the many hip food centers in Singapore. The complex has plenty of diverse restaurants. Next to Señor Taco is a middle eastern restaurant that has belly dance performances in the evening. Crowd of passer-bys would flock and film or photograph the dancer with their cell phones
2
This was my second visit to Chimes in a week, and after not having great food at the restaurant I chose previously, I decided to return to one of the restaurants that looked bustling and busy in hope of good food. As a single diner I hoped it would be easy to get a table on a Monday night - but I was only offered a seat at the bar - which being tired and hungry I took!! I later regretted this, as being so close to the grill behind the bar, I then pretty much smelled like a greasy onions all night as a result!!I chose the chicken enchiladas with rice and refried beans - they appeared almost immediately, but I have to say the quality seemed to reflect the time taken to prepare them!! The chicken was ok, but the sauce and the tortillas were really bland and not that pleasant - soggy and pretty tasteless. The only thing that added flavour was the refried beans - although refried beans aren't ever going to make a meal!!Still feeling hungry, I chanced dessert - only to be told there was only one to choose from. This turned out to be something crossed between a creme caramel and a panacotta - and this at least was ok.Having dined at Chimes twice I have figured 1 thing - it's a nice place to enjoy a drink outside on a warm evening, with the church lit up and the bustling ambiance....but judging on the two meals I had this week, the cuisine doesn't match the surroundings!
5
I had dinner at the new Senor Taco Clarke Quay yesterday, I tried the Carnitas Taco and the Baja Taco and they were sooo good!!! the table next to me ordered a Coronarita and I had to order it myself! Its the perfect combination of a fresh lime margarita with corona.The ambience is nice for hanging out with friends. I will definitely be back for more! Senor Taco is great i recommend this place 100
5
The new menu is fantastic, but particularly the caramelo de res is incredible!!
A must try!!
With a nice and cold Coronarita!!
4
Not exactly standard Mexican but well worth it. Margaritas are great. Service is good, effecitient and timely. Location is very good and restaurant has a great decor.
4
I'll be brief; food is very good, Margarita's tasty but weak, waiters pretty clueless (had no idea what Grand Marnier is, or what they put in their Margarita's), outdoor seating is blissful, but at 6:10pm indoor seating showing a selection of the raunchiest MTV videos going on a 15-foot TV screen isn't perhaps the smartest idea. But for the right crowd, this place is great
5
Tacos Al pastor, and Baja (fish) are outstanding. Closest to Mexico we have had in Malaysia or Singapore. Barbacoa was good, but a little over processed. Sangria was a little sweet, but delicious. Negra Modelo an Pacifico Bottles. If you have to ask how much, then you have been missing it long enough!

This review is for the chijmes outlet. Just stating the facts without any bias at all. I and my husband visited this place for dinner on 19 august. We saw a board of happy hour 2 for 1 drink offer as we entered the place. We were seated at a nice wooden table outside. Then after a while a guy comes to take our order. We ask him if there's some happy hour promotion. He says "no". We say that we saw a board outside which said so. He said he will check. He comes back to take the order and informs us that there is indeed a 2 for 1 offer on margaritas. We order the margaritas and ask him to bring the 3rd one a bit later so that it doesn't melt. He agrees. Now to place the order, We mention to him that we are vegetarians and do not eat meat and order vegetarian burrito and vegeratian enchilada. He looks confused and asks us to repeat. So we repeat, while he is still jotting down the order. When he is done, I ask him the wifi pwd. He said he will get it. After a while he comes back and asks if we want the red or green sauce in enchilada and that the red one is spicy and green is not since it is made of guacamole. So I reply green sauce. Then after a while a lady comes to us with notepad, and asks us our order of margaritas again and says that they will have to bring all 3 at the same time, even though it will melt. We say ok no prob. Then she asks our food order!!!!! The third time! We again mention that we are vegetarians and would like to order vegeratian enchilada and vegetarian burrito. She asks red or green sauce and says that green is more spicy. We say that the guy earlier told us that red was spicy. She says that the guy was new, so ignore that. We say ok red sauce then, no prob. Then I again ask for wifi pwd. She says it is not working outside. We again say ok no problem. Then the 3 margaritas come, they taste nice. Then the food arrives. I taste the enchilada and find chicken in my mouth to my horror!!! None of the guys are anywhere to be seen. I go inside and ask the lady if she got me meat enchilada! She takes my dish back and gets me a new one apologising. I tell her this is a huge error as I am vegeratian by religion. She says sorry and goes away. The food tastes ok, but the mood is extremely spoilt by now. We decide to do a take away for the third margarita on our table and ask another waitor (waitors are so tough to get hold of in this restaurant) if he has a glass for take away. He says "no"! Then we repeat" you don't have a plastic glass?". He says "yes" now! So he just hands over a glass to us. We then call for bill and ask to bring a feedback form. He gets the bill ( 86 dollars) quickly but no feedback form. We pay the bill and again ask for the form, we give a bad review and go inside to find a drop box so that he doest throw the form away. The manager comes to us and introduces himself. We hand him the feedback form over. He reads it and asks what happened. We narrate the whole incident. He just says sorry! And nothing more. Disgusted, we move out never to bother coming here again
2
Had dinner with 4 friends on a Saturday evening at Chijmes and will never go again. We had to deal with poor service providing microwaved food charged at high prices. I really like Mexican food and was hopeful that Senor Taco would be able to satisfy my cravings. I need to look elsewhere
4
senor taco is my favorite hangout place for a quick catchup with friends or just two rounds of drinks with my bf to de-stress. the staff is super friendly, and the food cheap and good. they serve the best strawberry margaritas in sg in my opinion
3
my husband and I went for lunch at Senor Taco, following a recommendation that they were the most authentic Mexican food in Singapore.The staff were friendly.The atmosphere is ok: they've got music tv playing which is a bit of a distraction and it wasn't particularly busy - perhaps it would be different in the evening.The food is expensive in comparison with other restaurants serving similar food in Singapore.The food we had was very tasty, but a word of warning: they do not (currently) mention this on the menu but all their sauces contain ground pine nuts. Very dangerous if (like me) you have a nut allergy! The staff were very good about it and offered to change the dish - in fact they did not charge us for the dish in question - but a word of warning, if you have an allergy you need to ask about it.Overall it was ok....but I wouldn't go back
4
Reviewing the Chijmes Location. An absolutely stunning location inside the Chijmes complex… the outdoor seating is the way to go, as Senor Taco seems to have secured the best spot in the whole complex. We sat on the comfy wooden chairs and watched a huge, tropical storm rolling in from northwest with the old, Catholic convent in the foreground… amazing.Our server was good and seemed to understand the menu really well.The food was delicious and tasted more authentic than any other Mexican food I’ve eaten in Asia. The mojito cocktail was fantastic… highly recommend.It’s hard to pay $40pp for food in Singapore, when you can feast on local food for a fraction of that… but this was worth it for something different in a unique setting
4
Friendly service, tasty tacos, great prices and a decent frozen margarita - what more does a lone business traveller need? There's always great people watching potential at this busy spot, so no need to bury yourself in a book or your iPad/iPhone. Tacos are $2.50 each and taste just as good if not better than some at home that cost $6
4
Felt like a good burrito and a frozen margarita. This chain has just opened up in the Star Mall in Rochester. Have tried their branch at Clarke quay before. These guys make seriously good frozen margaritas.
3
Not reallly what I would call traditional mexican. Its departure from the core ingredients and flavours is a little sad.
3
We ordered for quesadillas, which were really small portions. That's my only grudge against the place. Otherwise, with the outdoor seating, music and beers, it just adds to the fun that is Clarke Quay!!
4
Good location next to the river and popular with foreign tourists and open well into the night. Serves good Mexican food and drinks & cocktails. Very pleasant staff and promt service.

TAKE NOTE I AM REVIEWING THE SENOR TACO IN CHIJMESSince I recently created an account here, I decided to write reviews on the hotels and restau I have been to last year. This was one of them so that explains why it took time to make a review on my experience here. Anyhow, my friend and I, went here for dinner and ordered burritos and Salsa Molcajeteada. The place was cozy, you wouldn't feel the aircon though since they opened the wall right thru the garden. So we choose the place inside instead so we wouldn't have difficulty calling the waiters. To our surprise, they have not greeted a good evening or smiled at us nor smiled back after we did. They were smirking and eyebrow raising throughout the night. It took awhile to get our orders, to think that they only served 2 tables that night, ours and the other group of 5. But when we arrived there, the other group were already eating their meal. So it shouldn't take long to get ours. Till we got our meals, they weren't seem to be attentive on our follow up orders. Getting our bill was also a test of patience as we have tried to get it more than 3x and it seems that it fell on deaf ears. We also had our meal taken out coz their serving is way too much 2 people. But then again we waited more than 30mins and because of our conversation we totally forgot the reason why we were waiting. Just as when we're already a few steps away, had we not remembered we have something taken out we wouldn't go back and claimed it. People there, seriously need to have a coaching one on one from their managers or owners, on proper customer service and follow through. No initiative! Tsk. Tsk. By the way, the person I was with happens to be the F&B General Manager of Holiday Inn Singapore, said if he was in charge of your restaurant, he would fire all those people right away. Not a good way to ramp up and keep your clientele. No matter how big or small the group of people who comes in your restau
4
All I can comment for is the Tacos al Pastor. Outside of Mexico and southwest US, these tacos alone are the best I've had. The condiments weren't anything to brag about, but as a first generation Mexican-American, with roots from Monterey, NL, this is as good as you're gonna get. Overpriced like crazy, but well worth it for me. You want real Mexican food, go to Mexico. Maybe bring your own salsa
4
PLEASE TAKE NOTE THAT I AM REVIEWING THE CHIJMES LOCATION.We dined here with a group of friends (12 pax) last week to celebrate a birthday. I already had positive expectations about the place - given my colleague from Mexico told me emphatically that the food here was as authentic as it can be. He was 100% right. The food was excellent and did not fall short at all. The service, however, was appalling. The wait staff were slow, missed out on alot of our orders, and the time it too to get the food and our drinks was unacceptable. It's a good thing the food was good. The ambiance was ok. And the price was fair; quite good actually, especially since Chijmes is a more up-market location. I will definitely come back here but make sure that before doing so, I am not as hungry or in a rush to get my food. :
2
My spouse and I dined at Senor Taco on the Chijmes complex in Singapore on Oct 28, 2012. While the restaurant is comfortable and well appointed, the food leaves much to be desired, and is more of a "Mexican wanna be" than "Mexican". It is the first place in the world where I was offered "guacamole", a green runny fluid, in a squeeze bottle, alongside habanero and chipotle sauces, in similar bottles. The nachos had no tomato salsa on them, but refried beans smeared over (?), and mozzarella cheese, instead of cheddar. We had to send them back for re-heating, as the cheese was lumpy and had not even melted. I had a similar experience with my "Quesadilla Veggie" (a chef's recommendation in the menu), which came barely lukewarm and was rather tasteless. We did not finish the meals, as the disappointment was growing by the minute, so we left after finishing our drinks, promising not to return, even if hungry
3
The food is inexpensive and tasty, but the portions are small. Service here is excellent and friendly. You can sit at the bar or at tables and they have an assortment of beers and mixed drinks. This place is open very late (3 am maybe) and you can always go get a quick round of munchies in between shopping, bars and clubs. It is really best to visit here with your friends between the hours of 9pm and 12am and just sit back with a drink and watch the scenery. Watching the night lovers show up to the many clubs and bars in the area is quite an interesting sport
1
This is in Clarke Quay and I love their Habanero sauce, which I know of from their now defunked eatery called Senor Burrito. I may just be missing Senor Burrito, but in comparison, the food here is terrible, The meat taste like bits from your shoe really, no matter what you take, I only ever go there when I miss the habanero sauce so much that I can't help myself, and then I take the taco and cheese douse it with the Habanero and die and go to heaven. The cashier is ok, but the guy making the tacos, serious non-hospitality attitude. Horrible! Overall it's such a displeasure going there

Located in Chimes precinct so never going to be the cheapest. Lovely and fresh food. Great selection of Mexican food and decent tequila list too. Good for big groups but also can have quiet couple's meal outside.

Worse enchilada and tacos ever! Not only the ingrediants where totally wrong, it was lacking the well known flavours. The dishes were not oven baked, but nearly warmed up. Even the tortilla chips dip sause was tasteless. Enjoy your drink at this wonderfull location, but skip dinner

The food here was excellent. It wasn't the usual 'tex mex' dripping with cheese, but really tasty (reasonably authentic, as much as it can in Singapore) mexican and just awesome. Nice spacious outdoor seating on the stunning Chimes courtyard with indoor seating options too. We are regular travellers to Singapore and this is a great casual dining option. Location is great too in the Chijmes complex so particularly convenient for those staying in hotels around Raffles City (e.g. swissotel, fairmont, carlton). Highly recommended

Located in the wonderful atmosphere of the Chjimes Restaurant complex, the venue alos has outdoor seating which is very pleasant not just for the ambience but also on during the evenings when the temperature has dropped.The menu choice is wide enough however the quality of the food is nothing expectional. Like most mexican restaurants, serving sizes and generous. The service here is a bit chaotic and I found myself having to remind the waiting staff to bring drinks and even the starters well after we had originally placed the order.While its not fair to compare this with the tex mex venues in the US, its a reasonable venue if you are craving a mexican hit

Great selection of fingerfood and main dishes, all tastefully presented. Many many types of tequila on order.The location is in a large courtyard, with outside tables directly facing a grass patch where a band was performing.The place was buzzing with people, but the open area in the middle gave some air and it did not feel like everyone was sitting on top of each other.All in all - recommend

Tried it once and it was poor, gave it a second chance and it was worse.Poor excuse for Mexican food with tacos / quesadiallas with barely any fillings.I guess if you've the beer munchies on the way home after a night on the beer then it might satisfy your craving for grease.Much much better establishments within a stones through

Pros:- Quick service: in and out in no time.- Food's decentCons:- The portions were extremely small- Seems like they were more interested in selling beer than food Overall:In general, mexican food in Singapore is always over-priced (other than the one at Boat Quay - can't remember the name though) and this is no exception. Unfortunately for senor taco, the taste is not comparable to most of these other over-priced eateries so it is unlikely that I'll visit it again*. * But they do have decent beer deals so it might be worth your while

So to sum it up: great food, great music and videos, great service, great place!!! You guys have to try it!! The owner must be mexican, cause he really knows what he is doing!

We ate early (6pm) and had quick service. The cooks didn't seem to be too sure about what they were doing. Servings were small. It seemed as if they were more interested in selling beer than food. There must be better Mexican in Singapore, but OK for a quick meal on your way to other attractions

I had the misfortune of visiting Senor Taco at Clark Quay March 3020There is no doubt that this is a popular restaurant however, I could not fathom why.The restaurant was not busy, yet it took us over an hour and a half to get our food.The service is absolutely horrible, the waitress gave all kind of excusses from we have a new cook to the register is not working, never took responsibility for her own wrong doing. She kept forgetting and I didn't understand why, if there wasn't hardly any people there, that should've been my first clue. We literly had to ask for our food about 15 times, by then my hunger had passed, and I didn't eat it when the waitress finally brought us our food. Couldn't even tell you how the food was, since I never even got a chance to taste it
