Walked by the shop and decided to try their set lunch. The place has a casual, neat modern look with the open kitchen on one side. Had the beef pho which came with a serving of prawn fritters. The noodles had a bit of bite (which I like) and the broth was tasty and light. The beef, however, was a bit tougher than expected but the think slices made it palatable. The prawn fritters were a pleasant surprise. They were wrapped and fried into thin cone-like pieces and were surprisingly good. The only gripe is the serving is pretty small (probably because it is a set meal) but should be adequate for most ladies. Service was fast and efficient. Overall, a decent meal for the price

They have separated out the noodles and the garnishes so that one can choose what to add in for each personal taste. It also comes with a bowl of Keropok as well. I simply threw in all the parsley and mint leaves together with the lime juice and tuck it immediately. The soup base was clear and slight taste of citrous enhance my appetite (remember I was just looking for a small bite only). However, the only setback was the noodle soup was not hot enough, but that does not really affect the overall taste. The pork ribs was so soft and tender that you does not even requires any strength to chew the meat away from the bone. (^_^)The cup of dripped coffee was relatively small and the colour resembled of an expresso shot. On the first sip, you could taste the acidity of the coffee and a lasting strong bitter after taste. Perhaps Vietnamese like their coffee sweet, i thought too much sugar or milk does cover up portion of the coffee's original taste. Nevertheless, the vietnamese coffee definitely has its own unique taste and aroma.#foodingsingapor
