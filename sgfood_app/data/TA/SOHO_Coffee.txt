If you happen to stumble upon this wee gem on your travels then pop in and have a coffee - best in Singapore!

All day breakfast, great coffee, attentive service, comfortable chairs, free wifi, lovely ambience. Everything I look for in a cafe. Tucked away in a peaceful side street in the heart of the historical museum district.
