always had the chicken with grain $10 nett option, but it ran out today. so opted for the chicken wrap, and it was really good too. at $10 nett, its rather reasonable in the CBD.

new year resolutions have me eating healthy for awhile, and glad to discover this salad shop that serves rather tasty salad, both customised and pre-packed; try their chicken and grain, its delicious!

It was a very unique experience of eating in an altogether healthy food joint.The quantity available in different sizes are similar,not much difference in the portion-size.It is pricey,too.

My favorite salad for lunch. Elephant size plus a salmon on a bed of spinach base with a whole bunch of other healthy stuff. Avocado dressing is fantastic.

This for me was a surprise discovery.....would rate this as one of the best salad places in singapore. Enjoyed my lunch and really liked the variety they have to "make your own salad"
Excellent lunch and highly recommend for salad lovers

Very nice/clean and efficient place to eat something healthy in Singapore. Although I won't recommend you to go at lunch brake because is a total "war"... always after 2PM is perfect... quiet and sometimes no bread :)) but that's life anyway isnt that healthy :) the only little comment I think the prices are not cheap for such kind of salads and on mine they forgot to put the sauce (pesto in this case) or they put so little when I specify to be 50%more... pity..

LOCATION Right by One Raffles Place on the yellow river. Simple and well decorated. SERVICELines can be impressively long at lunch time but move so fast so don't get scared. Service is friendly an efficient. A good choice for take away in the evening for light dinner. Just keep in mind last order is at 16:45. Should stay open later in my opinion. FOODIf you like salads then is your place. For SG standards salads and veggies are fresh enough. Good choice of grains and add ons. Ample choice of dressing to satisfy any taste. I recommend it and will return. CIA

If you are a big eater, you may not find this filling. I order the biggest size, and top up to get soup and coffee. Smoked duck or salmon too ups are still my favourite. The rest is up to you. You choose what you want , queue up to make payment, then they will serve you when u r seated. Place is very cramp, not much privacy to talk. Many people just pack to go. Not cheap, easily $15 for a salad. Good to indulge and eat once awhile.

Since starting on my healthy diet, I have been hunting around for places for good salad. I have tried many salad shops and restaurants. Recently I came across The Salad Shop and had the best salad ever. The portions are generous, ingredients are fresh with great variety. The dressings make the salad taste so incredibly good, and every mouthful is heavenly. I love the different salad sizes you can choose from, according to the amount you feel lie eating.This place not only allows you to achieve healthy eating, it makes you enjoy the process. I am a strong believer that I can eat healthy and still enjoy my meal. Thank you for making this possible

Salads here are made to order right before they are served or put in a takeout box. A great option for those who want a fresh tasty salad (not something sitting in the chiller for some time). The soups are good too and the complimentary sliced bread is a nice touch (they only do white bread though). It gets really crowded at lunch time so where possible best to dine in off peak or come in early for a take out
