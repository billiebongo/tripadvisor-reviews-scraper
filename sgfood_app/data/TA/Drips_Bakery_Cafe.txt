Me and my hubby is a fan of their tarts! Especially dark chocolate and their fruit tarts are not too sweet and light for individual serving. A comfort food after a hard day at work !

The blackberry tart is very delicious without over sweet and bottom is not too hard. Quiche is very nice as well. Shop also offers various of bread , biscuit, and brunch. Coffee is average quality

Have tried some of their tarts. It is very delicious but pricing is quite expensive for each tart. The cafe gets crowded on weekends so I chose to takeaway instead.

Took away some pandan cakes and it was not happy with it. The bite is not what i expect of a fresh cake. It doesn't even had the nice aroma of pandan at all. A waste of money! Staff was straight faced and curt.

Enviroment is not cozy and comfi enough. Chairs have no backing and hard seating, not comfi, n. Aircond is warm and i am sweating. Food is so so only. I ordered kaya toast, it took 30min to come and it was not crowded. Food pastries are a bit pricey. A berry tart is at sgd9.8. oveall price is not average at that location. Food plates left on my table were not cleared until i requested.Overall i does not worth my visit. I wont return

DRIPS was voted top of the top 16 cafes in Tiong Bahru by TheSmartLocal in 2017. Their specialty is tarts and that’s exactly what I’ve been looking for.I was supposed to eat dinner first, then tart.I was careful not to over eat so I had their House Salad. A very colourful, crisp and crunchy salad with generous chopped nuts and sesame dressing. I said to myself I can eat this salad every day. I chose the berries tart and did wince a-bit to know a tart cost almost $10.I made sure I ate every bit of it, not just every berry bit every crumb. The tart wasn’t seeping wet at the base. So it didn’t crumble and remained crisp. Blueberries. raspberries, strawberries crowded over the tart. Every fruit from the tart was almost perfect. Every bite was a pleasure for my tastebuds.I’d like to visit again but I hope my next visit would see these improvements:Maintain a comfortable air conditioning temperature NOT a freezing, blasting one.Cleaner toilet and a “friendly” one with a hook to hang a bag

Nothing special about this cafe. I had a meringue lemon tart and a skinny cappuccino. The meringue tasted more like cream and doesn't seem to go well with the tart. The base of the tart was totally over baked and burnt. It had a bitter taste. I removed everything and ate the lemon filling only. For the price I would have expected something better. Coffee is average as well

Cafe is located near the junction and easy to locate along Tiong Poh Road. It offers freshly baked tarts and a good spread. The chocolate and fruit tarts are worth the calories. Pleasant ambiance though it can be quite noisy. Nice & friendly service.Street parking is limited

We went everyday we could whilst in Singapore. The tarts were flawless, the best I've ever sampled, and dare I say, ever will. Drips needs to come to England! The banana smoothie wasn't to my taste, it was a green banana taste instead of a ripe one. However, the ice tea was perfectly refreshing.If I ever return to Singapore Drips will be my first stop

Took an Uber down to check out this Bakery. I had the yuzu tart and chocolate tart. For me the chocolate tart was the winner and that quiche was very yummy as well! Lots of filling!

Came here for coffee and a tart after lunch today. Good selection of tarts, although fairy expensive. Coffee was good but not exceptional.

Been here many times for coffee and sometimes a yummy tart. Coffee is always good and cheaper than many other places in Singapore. At the moment they are doing renovations which should be completed in another week or so, so seating space is more limited and maybe a little noisier. Staff are lovely and remembered us from previous trips to Singapore. Love the Yuzu and Lemon tarts, also the Blackberry and Strawberry topped ones. Yes they are a little expensive but are big enough to share between 2 as an indulgence.We'll be back

We tried shop after shop, after dinner. So we tried the chocolate tart (not the salted one) it was microwaved to warm for us. $8 each and complementary cold water.It tasted and textured like a lava cake I would have at most restaurant. The tart was quiet nice but not outstanding. Maybe I aimed too high. Would I come back? Probably not since there is real competition Around there.

Drips is located on 82 Tiong Poh Road, and even though you can easily get there by hopping on a bus from either Tiong Bahru or Outram Park MRT stations, I suggest taking a bus from the latter as the bus stop (called Blk 55, stop ID: B06051) is a lot closer to the café as opposed to coming from the Tiong Bahru side. Exit Outram Park MRT Station via Exit A, cross the overhead bridge to reach the bus stop called Opposite Outram Park Station (Stop ID: B06011). From there, take any of the following bus services listed: 33, 63, 75, 121, 851, or 970 and alight at the next stop, which is Blk 55. Walk through the lane behind the bus stop, turn left at Tiong Bahru Bakery and continue straight till you hit a traditional coffeeshop; Drips is diagonally opposite on the right. Alternatively, from the bus stop just walk in the direction you came, past Galicier Confectionary, turn right at Chapter 55 and you should see the same traditional coffeeshop as well.The café specialises in tarts and they usually offer a lot of different varieties. The ones garnished with fruits are camera-worthy, though they can be a lot pricier. For instance, the Strawberry Tart can cost S$9.20 apiece. In decreasing order of prices are the sliced ones, followed by the individual ones. I’ve tried a couple of their tarts before, while they are all usually quite delicious, my favourite is the Choc de Tart (S$7) and the chocolate salted caramel one (S$7); they may not look as pretty as the others but taste-wise they’re a lot better! The former is bitter and rich the way I like it, while the latter’s salted caramel is not overly sweet that it overpowers the chocolate. Service was average; the staff didn’t seem very enthusiastic but they got the job done anyway so no complaints from me

My first try cafe in Singapore & is the worst cafe ever !I'm a hot chocolate lover n i can tell is from chocolate powder !! my wife order flat white n is milky n when we give feedback to one of the barista (slim , tall with spec) what a bad attitude (sound like they don't care) Do not visit this cafe, terrible coffee and bad attitude from barista

The coffee was excellent . But the desserts were to die for. Tried the Cinnamon Raspberry tart and the Dark Chocolate Tart( which melted in your mouth) and if that was not enough took away a box with Baked Lemon Tart and a Mixed Berry Tart. A must do if you are in Singapore ..

A ingest my favourite places for coffee and cake. The fruit tarts are superb and the chocolate deserts very good. If you prefer savoury nibbles their sandwiches are also of a consistently high standard.Add to that the slightly quirky, very clean premises and the friendly helpful staff and you come up with cafe that is adelight to visi

Visited this wonderful little cafe and am so pleased we did. Staff are friendly and helpful. But of course it was the pastries that really stood out. You can watch the guys actually making them through a window. We had raspberry and almond tart and it was perfect. My husband had the passion fruit tart and he said it was the best. If you get a chance please pay them a visit

I particularly love the Pear tart. And do hunt their baking times or ask for the tart to be warmed up. I love the interior that provides an open concept view of the baking area. Natural light fills that place and it's my secret place for inspiration when it comes to work. Go there just for the tart. It's lovely

Cozy place. Cafe has a variety of pastries. I like the brownies with ice cream. Drinks were quite pricey though. Good place to hang-out with family & friends.

I ordered the all day breakfast (sausages, mushrooms, tomato, scrambled eggs, toast so hard they could cut tongues). Also ordered a fruit tart which tasted decent. Not worth the money.

We've lived nearby for nearly two years, but I just walked into Drips for the first time on December 31st. I picked up some amazing tarts for NYE and have been back 2x since. I had great help from Jason (I think -- from my receipt) yesterday who was super helpful and recommended his favorite cookies, the Almond Sugee cookies...amazingly addictive! I'll definitely be grabbing dessert from Drips for future dinner parties

I walked all around tiong bahru to find a cafe to chill in, and came across Drips and decided to give it a try - definitely a good decision. The couch area is super cosy and comfy and just has a really nice feel, i had a great coffee and tried the mango and blackberry tart which was delicious! And service was really great, they advised me to wait for a fresh tart that came straight out from the kitchen! Love it

The place was crowded even though it was a hazy Monday evening. We tried the mixed berries tart, dark chocolate tart and the cinnamon pear tart. All of us loved the tarts. While the tarts were pricey, there were generous portions of fresh blue berries, strawberries and pear. The dark chocolate was rich and thick. They were absolutely delicious! I would return again to try the other tarts

Saw a review for this cafe and when in the neighbourhood found it. Doesn't open until 11am which is later than some reviews. We had the delicious fresh fruit buns, with an iced coffee. Very good, lots of temptations - home made cakes etc. Recommend a visit if you are in Tiong Bahru.

Lovely place to meet friends for coffee and cake! Nice friendly atmosphere to spend a few hours catching up with a tasty offering from Drips. Service is ok, not amazing but absolutely fine. Coffee is great! Reasonable prices also. Would return again and recommend if you are in the area

I have tried their best selling apple cinnamon tart and dark chocolate tart along with mushroom, cheese and spinach toasted focicca bread along with ice latte. The tarts were excellent. The coffee was freshly brewed and tasted fantastic too. They have six to seven varieties of tarts. Definitely, I will return to try them all.Overall, it's a nice neighbourhood cafÃ© selling excellent tarts and coffees at a reasonable price. In contrast to the fellow reviewer's negative points, they're serving water now and the service is good. Looks like they have improved

We came here today for a coffee and a tart after lunch in the vicinity. Great atmosphere even on a weekday lunchtime. My cappuccino had a pretty little design and plenty of flavour. The blueberry/raspberry tart was also quite decent. Prices aren't particularly cheap, but then you get what you pay for
