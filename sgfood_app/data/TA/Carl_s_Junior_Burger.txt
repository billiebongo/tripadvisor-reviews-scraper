prices are high food quality and taste not at all similar to the U.S. but conveniently located in front of Marina Mall.
3
Yeah its a burger chain.. i wouldn't go out of your way to find it..I found the burger to be quite boring.
5
Had the Angus Beef Burger with my favourite Crriss Cross Fries, simply amazing and melts in your mouth.
I always visit Carls Jr when in Singapore.
3
I like carl's junior~ but this branch looks a bit messy, average service. Location is.good, near office. Dining experience was soso... i prefer the one in VIVO
3
Average burger with average service, but nothing new here this is the same everywhere. They offer free flow bottomless soft drink deals. It took a bit of time to get my order too, while it was quite.
5
Quick lunch with family on a public holiday. Bacon chicken burger tasted awesome. Big holiday crowd but the queue moved fast. Service was fast and the staff were polite

For Foreigners who dont know what Carl's Junior Burger is it's a west coast fast food joint in the U.S. I dont normally eat fast food but craved a burger so we went. Place was clean and moderately busy. It is for "fast food" a little pricier than it should but burger + fries were very hot and tasted good
4
After all these years. I consider Carl's Junior high quality and certainly much better than other burger joints in Singapore. Pricing is a little higher but worth it. Burgers are thicker and juicier, fries seem more freshly cut and fried. Like the self serve drinks and condiments.
1
Carl’s Jr (Singapore), at least its Jurong Point branch, started to show all the signs of all other failed fast food shops and restaurants I observed in Singapore so far. These signs include, rude staffs, wrong delivery, wrong charging, etc. Another important sign is, they are not keen to take any feedback from the customers. I won’t be surprised if I see Carl’s Jr closing down their business in Singapore in the near future. Meanwhile, I would recommend foreigners not to visit Carl’s Jr in Singapore as it will give them a completely wrong idea about Carl’s Jr in Anaheim

It's american chain burgers - in Singapore, It's not the best american chain burger to start with, but if you haven't had one of the others you won't know any better and you'll enjoy the novelty.The burgers taste the same as they do in the US so points for consistency. The service was good & the food was hot and fresh.If you're after a novelty, or you're homesick then you' ll be happy. About S$9 for a burger and S$13 for a combo.It's mid-range dining and let's face it, in Singapore there is so much better for so much less on offer. But if you've somehow managed to become bored of the hawker stalls, or you're an unadventurous tourist, then it's not the worst tou can do. Just don't expect too much and you'll be happy
3
The burger here is better than Burger King and McDonald... Juicy tasty and not as dry as McDonald... Worth to spend a little more to come here than eat at the other 2 places.
4
The service was amazin and the staffs was kind and friendly:) not to forget the food was marvelous too.
4
the beef here is Hugh and juicy whatever you order. The good also is the drink are free flow. Although it's expensive, but it worth the price. Be prepare you get messy because the burger is ready big.
5
I enjoyed burger here twice during my trip in singapore. its really good taste, cozy atmosphere and nice staff. thank you all
3
The burgers are still good, value for money, but what happened to the beef chili cheese fries? The fries were tough, cheese was not melted and i could even count the amount of minced beef in the box. Although it was a take-away order, but the quality was just bad. It is now just another overpriced fastfood outlet.Such disappointment
4
Compared to other chains, the burgers feels more premium, the quality slightly better and more variety in type of meat and veggies. I usually order the Famous Star. The food is delivered to the table after making it so there can be some waiting time if many customers. They have mayo but have to ask for it
4
Carl Junior has different unique burgers cater for different audience. My first impression of carl junior compare to other fast food chain is they had big burger and the portion is very filling. Their chili cheese fries taste good too. There are also free serving of different sauces. I learnt from my colleagues to mix all the sauces into the cheese fries and it taste real good! In term of the pricing compare to other fast food chain, for the set meal is much higher cost (approx. ~12 to 15dollar)If I want to go for slightly healthier version, they had burger wrap with vegetable and not bread (carbohydrate) as shown from my photo.Personal favourite burger is portobello mushroom thickburger. They are using premium beef where you can taste a big difference from other beef burger.Burger lover would love carl junior. Enjo
2
well this fast food chain, the burger is good and warm, bigger then the rest, the fries is just so-so. but they're service is very poor (e.g. they just don't lisiten to customer compliant/feedback and never fellow up any action and never lisiten to what customer wants
4
On the ground floor of the shopping mall near the hotel, it is convenient. Better burgers than McDo, but still industrial processed grade. All you can drink soft drinks that one can pour by oneself. Service is close to non existent, but that is the way they operate.
4
They serve large very satisfying burgers here and as they say,be prepared for a messy dining experience !They serve generous beef patties in their hamburgers so reallyit is value for money for the portions & burger quality.Their set deals include free flow of drinks.Their is also a salad bar optionFood rating : 6.5 out of 10 point
4
Those hungry for huge and filling burgers can eat here. Value for money and I love the many varied burgers.
4
the only irk is the much higher prices compared to its prices. but my favourite is the bacon western cheeseburger. but its beef patties and the different variation of fries to choose from is the highlight here. a good treat for every now and then.
5
try the low carb - awesome- makes you feel as though it might even be healthy for you with no bread lol
5
For me it's as simple as this: this is the best fast food ever! The burgers are huge and tasty! Try the one with Guacamole! You won't regret it!
5
Familiar brand of burger from USA.
Hard to beat the low carb hamburger for taste and price.
Easily my vote for the best value burger in Singapore.
Excellent consistent service and quality of ingredients.
3
This Burger Joint is one of a chain and offers a large variety of burgers (very hard to make a decision). Once you have made the decision, the rest is easy. Wait a while and then get stuck into one of the best burgers around. True, it's a bit more expensive than the super burger chains but they don't have the size value and taste of a good old fashioned burger
2
I never expect much from a burger in a fast food restaurant however this particular branch was a let down, the staff were somewhat miserable when dealing with me.....the food itself was luke warm and soggy...the burger a bacon and cheese style was wet and tasteless and the rest of it fries etc very forgettable....I like Carls hence I was disappointed as I love the branch in San Fran..maybe I caught it on a bad day but I doubt I will retur
3
To be honest, I struggled with the burger. It was huge, slimey, sauces soaking through the buns onto my hands, creating a huge mess. It was hard to eat, very delicious and definitely finger-licking good, for want of a cliche, but with people standing in line waiting for their turns - they had nothing to do but to look around and I sensed some were staring at how I was tackling my burger - I gave up eating, red-faced, wiped my hands and left. So my advice is to go for "drier" ones like their bacon burgers and ask for takeaways and eat at home. This way when you make a fool of yourself, no one will dare laugh
4
Love the burgers here and even the fries... They definitely beat the competition out of the other burger joints around. Yes, the price is slightly higher than the other burger joints, but when comparing the size, both hubby & myself are full just sharing one burger over here, so that more than makes up for the price.Considered as great value for money since you can also help yourself to the free flow of drinks as well... Just found out that the Big Splash branch has a drive through area... :
5
The original Famous Star burgers were made at Carl's Drive In in in my hometown, Anaheim,CA in the early 50. Carl's Jr founder, Carl Karcher, was flipping burgers himself. The Famous Star burgers at Plaza Singapura in Singapore are exactly like those Carl made in Anaheim 60 years ag
4
The burgers here are mega sized and I enjoyed the taste of these. These would have to rank amongst the best burgers possible. Wish they would employ better counter staff though. Had a tough time explaining myself to them
5
Nothing much to say really. This is a fast food joint that serve REALLY good burgers and side dishes. I recommend the Guacamole Burger with fries (pick some jalapenos from the condiments desk to give it some additional punch).
4
simply like their burger and also their fries , not to forget onion rings. No way you can compare it with McX and KFX ..
their potion can be a big huge, it can actually shared by two.
4
price wise on the high side.
taste and burger choices are considered the best. never fail to disappoint me. i will go eat this CJ once in a month. :) get someone to share the burger will be a good idea :)
3
We were at the Jurong Point outlet last month, very few customers, Carl's Junior used to have brisk business.We used to have tasty & juicy burger here, but the standard had dropped, the burgers were average, but very salty, we had a lot of water after the meal.Hopefully, this was an isolated incident
4
I ordered a low-carb burger and it came housed in lettuce leaves. The patty was very juicy and tasted yummy. The only down-side to this was that without the bun to hold the patty in place, the juices ran down my hands and I got very messy eating this burger. If only I was provided with a fork and knife, I could have eaten more elegantly
5
For it's size and pricing, CJ Burger is by far my favourite burger joint in Singapore. The size will just blow your mind and their taste will leave you craving for more. What I really like about CJ Burger are their fries. They use all natural potato cuts, with the skin on. It just gives the fries an extra crispy outer layer, that will tingle your taste buds when bitten into. I would gladly choose CJ Burger over Mcdonalds anytime of the day,week,month. Maybe I'm just biased, but CJ Burgers are the way to go if you're looking for some sinful cholesterol goodness. =D
5
If you really must have fast food or junk food ...have the best ...unlike other burger joint that now offer better meat ..Carl's been serving great burger with REAL meat ..yes it do cost more ..but the taste compensates for everything ..as this is a fast food joint ..don't expect any service ...you got bugers craving ..Carl's the place
5
There's no Carl's Junior from where I lived so I'm pleased I get to try it out at Singapore. I ordered the Guacamole Burger. Beef patty is juicy, tomato and lettuce was fresh and juicy too, cheese blended perfectly. This is by far the best burger I have ever had in my entire life hands down. Just my personal opinion though :OBy the way, don't forget to swap your fries with the Chili Cheese Fries!
3
The beef patty for some outlets were very dry. Supposed to be juicy but lately the beef patty seemed to be overcooked and lacking in flavour. I miss the quality of the burgers they serve when they just opened, gone were the days of the really big and juicy beef patty
4
I know the Junior is a name not really the junior. But well, that's catchy. I loved Carl's Jr burger. I'm a big fan of McD but they serves really delicious, good, big portion of burger! Soft drinks are free flow as well.
5
Love the low carb burger. Lettuce is used to wrap the beef patty instead of the usual burger buns. Help yourself with the drinks, salsa and sauce when you order a combo meal.
4
Tad pricy but the serving is huge for asians. I like the chicken tenders for my kids. And the portobello mushroom burger is divine. great they have re-fillable drinks as well,.
2
Carl's Junior Burger is grossly overpriced ... ihmo, you better off going to a small restaurant than spending at Carl's Junior.
4
Great burger for anytime of the day and you will never feel hungry after that
4
We come here regularly 'coz my kids love its western bacon burger, onion ring and rich milkshake. I like how Carl's Jr uniquely provides its special chili sauce, salsa, and jalapeno as condiments to enhance its burger taste.
4
If you like your fast food restaurant burger meaty & juicy, this is the place to go. Fries are good too. For small eaters, the set meal can be too much. The staff is happy to slice the burger into 2 for you to share. Just ask when when you order
4
Eversince Carl Jr opened in Singapore, I find that there's no more reasons to return back to Mac (Unless it's closed). Free Flow of Drinks made it an ideal place to chit chat with friends. Currently my fave outlets are the Big Splash outlet and the Marina Square. Highly recommended if you are craving for burger
4
There are a few outlets in Singapore and I've eaten at the one on East Coast Road and several times at the one in Tampines.Compared to the more common fast food restaurants, where portions appear to have shrunk gradually over the years, the Carl's Jr burgers are BIG and tasty. I usually have one of their angus beef burgers and occasionally have the one that comes with guacamole. Being so big, I skip fries 'cos I rather have the complimentary tangy salsa & peppers to go with my burger
5
I love the juicy beef burger here, tasted awesome and great. So far is my favorite beef burger in town. The portion is relatively big and I need to share with others but I love all the beef burger.I tried the chicken burger but it is just average
3
If you are already tired of eating sea food and want to grab a burger somewhere m this is your place. Better than the regular fast food chains.
2
I think my subject header says it all. Was my favourite... but the last time I had it, it was so expensive and the quality was so dismal.
5
For me The Carl´s Junior is one of the most delicious hamburguers I´ve ever eat.
4
In Singapore, I think this is one of the best burger restaurants. Large size and good quality burgers and the best part, drinks are refillable. I think its worth the money and its one of my favourite burgers restaurants.
5
Double Burger an Chili Cheese fries Man oh Man do you feel great full stuffed an satisfied Its one of the best burgers what will cross you lips
3
The burger is way too big for me. I wish they sell them at smaller portion & at a lower price too.
4
The salsa is fresh and not to be missed. It's free too !
5
Really - it's tasty and expensive - as everything else in Singapore but it's tastes - just watch your cholest!
4
Ate Carls Junior at Vivo City. The meals are all very expensive. But they make you full as the burgers are huge. The only downside is the price of the meals. Makes you think that Mcdonalds and the other fast food outlets are more value for money
5
It may be `fast food' but the variety makes you perceive it otherwise. I don't mean `the food arrives slow' but the sheer depth of the Burger and Sides menu gives it a top spot in the Burger Eatery arena. My favourite is the Guacamole and Bacon Thickburger. Simply mouthwatering
5
I love this burger joint even before and I still love it. The free flowing of drinks, the big service of drinks...the ONION rings! yey! love it...
4
LOve the burger.. tasty for a quick bite if you are around the area
5
You can buy the low carb burger. No bun but fresh crisp lettuce instead. Best burger I hae eaten in ages with no after effects!!
4
Very huge burger, very huge fries, very huge drinks.. which is unlimited. I love it! Its an American serving. Wasnt able to finish it off since the size overwhelms me. Should have shared it with my hubby ;)
5
Great tasting burgers at almost affordable prices. One problem.... I never know which burger to go for everytime I visit.
4
Was really great until they reduced the size of the burger last year! Love the condiments and guacamole burger!!
5
dope!!this is what i call a hamburger!!
3
Satisfies the occasion crave for a burger...
4
Great burgers! try the guacamole or the chili burgers, you won't be disappointed!
2
Burger's et al.
4
Value for money, after trying Carl's, I have not gone back to Macs nor BK
4
Juicy burgers, the best fast food type, way better than a Mac or a BK
3
for the filling burgers
2
Yummy burgers that I got to agree!
5
love the burgers..n love their salsa sauce too!
4
best burgers in town.
4
I ALWAYS order my favorite Portabello Mushroom Burger (with onion rings, of course) whenever I visit Carl's Jr. It's my favorite unhealthy meal!
3
Yummy greasy burgers...
3
Yummy burgers!
3
Like the portobelo mushroom burger and milkshake.
3
Worth to skip 10 McD visits for one at Carl's.
4
Spicy Beef Fries!
2
not as "special"....
2
Just burger... nothing to rave about
3
love the range of sides and its chicken pieces
1
NOT value-for-money leh.
4
Love the portobello mushroom burger

i like ths joint.. The burgers are solid, huge and beefy!! And finally.. a place that serves REAL salads with chicken and blue cheese dressing too!!
3
This is the upsized version of McDonald's upsized portions. Deliciously huge portions for those with big appetites. Best of all - free flow of drinks and can choose your own pickles and other appetizers to go along so that you won't feel "gelak" ! Another plus- can choose healthier versions of the burgers for those who are into healthy eating
4
The salad's good!
2
No doubt that this fastfood chain sells burgers but not in regular sizes. I think it offers one of the best fastfood burgers in town.
3
Nice burgers if you can handle the calories..
3
cheese fries ^^
2
Chilli chesse fries
3
have to share the burger
3
great burgers for a fast food joint.
4
Love the pickles, salsa and the crispy bacon burger. Actually I like every thing with bacon.
3
Taste better than some fast food outlets but pricing wise definitely got to revised lower. Portion wasn't as big as before and the price do not match the food.
3
Better than some popular burgers but the portion is huge and the price is steep!
2
so so only.......
4
slurp
5
for great, huge burgers go here. and the onion rings taste like real onions, not the processed kind. haha.
3
Cholesterol injection for the month - Nice and hearty indulgence (once every few months is ok)
3
Sin food
5
damn good burgers
4
One of my fav fast food. This is real burgers..
3
huge serving~ for the hungry ppl~
3
love the beef fries & onion rings!
4
messy and yummy!
2
The ingredients and portion are worth you extra buckeroos. However, too much of everything makes thing worse. I feel that the portion is too huge thus making the burgers jelat!
3
A little expensive
3
need only apply if you are up for a major pigout! good burgers.
3
Even though it taste quite good... the portion is too big for comfort...
4
My fav fast food.... why are they not delivering to further areas? Will gladly pay...
3
over-sized burgers i love to sink my teeth into, jaws get tired after chewing one third thru, hehe...
4
my favourite fast food joint! :) Beef burgers never tasted better (esp the portebello beef burger!)...chilli fries...ahh..simply divine.
4
Famous Star with Cheese-Charbroiled all beef patty on a Toasted Sesame Seed Bun. Love those CrissCut fries.
5
Me and my girlfriend's all-time fav =)
1
very salty chicken...yucks.
5
Love the portion . Yummy first on my fast food list after BK. Tis is how a burger suppose to taste like .
2
Besides being extremely large, the burgers are overated. Its a no for me
4
chilli cheese fries is yummy!
5
The burgers are so fat, juicy, sinful and delicious! Just the way burgers are suppose to be.
4
A real Treat for flame broied burger fans.
3
Don't really fancy burgers but anyhow waaaaay better than mcdonald
3
Nice grilled chicken burgers. But I still can't get past the bun. Oh well.
4
huge serviings ... chili cheese fries ... yum yum ....
3
Big-sized burgers!
3
Juicy, thick beef patties...yummm
3
a meal here is enough to feed a village in africa...
i do love the beef chilli cheese fries
4
Great portions with refillable drinks. Seriously all fast foods should be like this. Fried zucchini is great! Burgers are OK, huge but not very special. Onion rings have real onions in them.
Go when you're really hungry.
1
I always feel compelled to walk into a Carl's outlet whenever I see their delectable pictures on a hungry stomach. But half-way through my burger, I'm always wondering why am I adding unhealthy american excess fat into my asian body...
4
its more worth it for a big eater like me and also quality and quantity applies
3
Higher priced than the usual fast food. Worth the money. Better ingredients are being used, portions are at least twice the size compared to regular local burgers. Free-flow drink with your meal.
4
Get Deliciously Messy!
3
Good meaty burgers. It's fastfood done slowly. Sinful.
4
Super huge burgers! Even the fish burger is surprsingly huge. I can say everything is humongous even to the side orders
3
The burgers are good, though a bit expensive....
4
definitely for the hungry - mouth watering burgers and awesome criss-cut fries.
3
Big Burger is the one.
3
Huge servings of burgers and fries, but with the recent write up of red meat and processed meat increasing the risks of different kinds of cancers, this may or may not affect the business.
All in all, its value for money.
5
This is what i call American size burger! Love the mushroom burger and the cheese fries is nice too.
5
The best Burger in the world...Not even different than I tried it in California.
1
Not my type.
3
The original, and best branch of this hearty chain. Far outclassing McD's and even BK. Watch out for the many bored teenaged-girls staring at their half-nibbled burgers, obviously there only to indulge their famished boyfriends
3
Nice!
4
I love it but was told the standard has dropped? Who can tell me if it is still as good? I got to try it again man ..
4
Bigger and better than Mcdonald's and BurgerKing. Like the Chilli Burger.
4
Haha, good for Ladies' Night out, Dating Routine! Guranteed to not break the wallet while delivering a satisfactory burger!!
