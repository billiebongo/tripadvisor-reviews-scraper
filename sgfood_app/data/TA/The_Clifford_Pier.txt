The location of the Restaurant is great. Huge, open space. The food was delicious, but a bit pricey. If you want to have something special, go there.

Great Experience. The food was good. Great for couples. Service was great. Value foe money.
Atmosphere was also great. The food might look little but the quality is great.

It is a great space, and the seating very comfortable (although our corner table was too close the next table). We had a Chinese New Year buffet and the range of food on offer was wide - we didn't sample all the stations. The food was good and well presented. I'm happy to pay a premium to enjoy such a nice place, and the meal wasn't cheap. I differ from my fellow trip adviser in that I thought the service could be more relaxed: waiters kept asking to remove plates. But they did so politely and were helpful. And we were tired after a long day slog round Singapore, and enjoyed our experience here

Yes the room is beautiful but the buffet is absolutely terrible.Extremely poor selection of appetizers and cheese, overcooked fish and duck... The beef was okay but you really have to ask for a slice to be prepared right for you because the ones they leave under the warming lights get as dry as paper.Staff is mostly uninterested into what you think about your experience, as long as you pay you can leave disappointed they couldn't care less.Avoid at all cost

I remember the Pier in the 1970's - it certainly looks different today & I like seeing it preserved & used.The tables are large & the seating is comfy.The service was great, & although my food arrived slightly different from described the staff were happy to correct it.The food was tasty & well cooked but not cheap. I guess this is really a bit of a tourist diner - but for me it had old memories so I really enjoyed eating here

Went for the high tea with mummy.After we got seated, we were not presented with any menu or explanation of any kind what they are serving at the moment.We waited as we thought someone will come soon.But no..... after 15 mins of waiting I had to call out to get the menu and order a drink for my mum.Food was cold and hard and I had to ask 3 times for water as I was drinking champagne and I really needed water to cleanse my mouth after eating.Staff were just standing around talking amongst themselves or chatting with particularly a couple of tables that looked like their friends or family.The coffee shop below my block offers better food and service.Won’t go back again for sure. High tea places aplenty in Singapore.I’m unhappy because it was supposed to be a date with mummy but they ruined it for us. :
3
Just came here today at 330 for high tea was about 40% full. Service was second-rate. Took 25 minutes to get my tea, gave me the wrong tea, some of the cookies were missing from our plates when we received them, it was hard to get servers attention, and then they left the empty plates and their holders on our tables for far too long. Beautiful restaurant but not worth the hassle of getting down there and the hassle of making sure you actually get what you want. One plus of notable mention, they do have options for your menu if you need: vegetarian and non-pork

After researching for a place for a quality high tea the Clifford pier rated very highly.The place itself is lovely and the staff very friendly and attentive but for $50 ++ a personI felt the selection was very ordinary. The savory selection was quite good, you get 8 of them plus 8 sweet servings. Some of the sweets were inedible and I'm a sweet tooth.They were bland, and some felt a bit on the stale side. We left more than half of them and no one questioned us as to why. I also ordered a latte, nice to have the choice but it was so awful I didn't drink it. tasted like sump oil. I don't believe it was made via a proper coffee machine as it had artificial froth on top. For the price I expected a higher quality of food and drink. I suspect the food was catered for a different clientele than us

The Clifford Pier is part of the Fullerton Bay Hotel, a modern version of the classic Fullerton. Hence, services and hospitality are promising in this property. Clifford Pier itself is beautifully decorated with extra high ceiling and traditional sofa seat. It would say this dining place is more on quaint side instead of hip side. Haven't got a chance to try their renowned afternoon tea. Based on the light dinner I had there, I would say food quality basically catches up with other high standard set in this place
3
Very disappointed with the variety and quality of the snacks for the price that I had to pay for the high tea. With a couple of dollars more, I can be enjoying a decent buffet lunch with fresh seafood elsewhere. The taste of the snacks was so-so only, nothing fantastic nor extraordinary too. The only thing I liked was the nice quiet ambience.The restaurant, however, was pretty attentive. They surprised me with a small cake for my birthday which is a very nice gesture on their part. This attentiveness was missing when I dined at Jade a week ago for the same occasion. Incidentally, The Clifford Pier and Jade are under the same hotel management.For the type of food offered for the high tea, I think it would be more appealing and enjoyable for diners if the price is lower. It is really not worth the money at the current price
4
Food was pricy for local food. Taste is ok. Atmosphere so so due to open space. Servicing staff seems to be busy and food takes a long time. Overall, all went well.
5
Nice food. Good service. The lobster roll is delicious. However, I ordered from the set and it did not come with the usual truffle fries that I would prefer
5
We had our anniversary dinner here and the ambience was perfect, pianist playing lovely music, and choice of food delicious
5
Decor and ambience was lovely. We had laksa and chilli crab pasta; we were impressed with the latter, as it had generous serving of fresh crab meat... Yummy! Service was good too. The lime tart I had was not impressive, I didn't finish. Price wise, it may seem pricey for local fare, but well, setting and ambience is different; cannot be compared. A bonus for us was the piano and singing performance; enhanced our enjoyment by heaps and perfect to wind down our work week. Very nice experience! Will go back again

I was with a gang of eight. Five were locals so I guess they picked this place as a special venue or something like that. It's like eating in a train station. I don't mean that as a bad thing. It's a huge open space and architecturally pretty interesting. The food was so so. I may have ordered poorly - 'chicken rice' it's called but it really was bland. The guy to my right was really happy with his food, the girl to the left said her chips were soggy. So not a great food experience. The thing that made the place hard to stomach was the demographic and the music. It's all men in sports jackets, ladies in stillehtoes with a glimpse of side boob.....and piano music. The piano music is the buzz-kill. He plays, she sits on top of the piano and sings stuff like titanic with nauseating levels of emotion. Would put most people off a meal but maybe it's worth it for a look

Have a Heritage Dim-Sum Brunch at the Clifford Pier. So disappointed that the service is really terrible. The reception greeting is really bad. Guest have to stand there and wait while she is chatting on the phone. Follow that just bring us to our table and walk away without even bother to ask if we want any coffee or tea to start off. It is Heritage spread where it suppose to introduce the delicacy of Singapore but seriously the food are really below the standard. I think the hawker food will taste better and cheaper too.The number of dim sum also minimum. Basically there is no waiter or waitress to serve your too. Requested for the coffee and tea waited for the sugar almost never come. Needed to ask twice just for sugar. Overall the really didn't worth the money paid either for the food or the service
5
Had a great experience here - our server was very helpful and guided us well. We shared the Heritage tasting menu and the lobster roll special. The heritage tasting menu is quite substantial so unless you have skipped lunch may be too much for one person. We really enjoyed both.
5
This was our second visit for the Hi tea experience. What a great time we had. All of us loved the food and the environment that we experienced.Congratulations to the management for training such a helpful staff. We were welcomed by such a nice european lady, I was impressed of her attentiveness to meet my vegetarian needs. The food is always maintained at very high quality, well done! Live music and excellent service just make the place lovely and enjoyable.Many thanks to Selan who took good care of our table. He was the best ever thoughtful and helpful. We definitely will be back!
5
My table was served by Selan and his service amazing. We were so well taken care of and he is so humorous. The service overall from the team is really good. Thanks you very much!Next come the food. The afternoon set is more toward asian snack like chilli crab bun, panda swiss roll, Kuih Pie Tee, etc. There is live music and singing, nice soothing background music and singing
3
In the experience economy service is everything. It can elevate bad into good and further beyond. In other cases it reduces what should have been a high quality event to a laughable one. Thankfully, today, it was a joke rather than a painful jaunt. It really should have been much better. I think the staff need some training
3
I would say the place is really good for taking photos. The food is ok and the ambience makes up for it.
5
Excellent service as always. Appreciate the amazing atmosphere, the spaciousness of the restaurant and the delectable desserts.
5
This is a beautiful resturant with great views of the Marina Bay Sands across the water. We had a teatime working meeting and it’s relatively quiet and conductive for discussion. The overall service is good.

We came to Clifford Pier at the Fullerton Bay Hotel on 14th December for its one time buffet dinner during our first time to Singapore and final night stay. I would have rated this event 6 stars on TripAdvisor if only I could!Very special mention to Sharul (Shye) for assisting with reserving our table right next to the live pianist & singer, the very warm welcome/greeting on the night and throughout our dinner!!The buffet dinner was great, but at best, it's a buffet... However, when you mix this with the venue, then it's a totally different story. Clifford Pier is truly a classical story of when heritages meets pure elegance. The architecture, display settings and ambience is absolutely amazing. Photos within Clifford Pier would show totally symmetrical architecture of the curved ceiling and even the huge chandelier would reflect a perfect mirror image on the marble floors. The images turns out spectacular!You can also walk out to the balcony and have a direct face on view of Marina Bay Sands (light shows), Singapore Flyer and really, enjoy the entire Marina Bay views.The highlight of our dinner was that the live singer and pianist did a wonderful job at playing songs which my 6 year old daughter loved (e.g. River Flows in You) and then asked what song she wanted to hear. My daughter said 'my heart will go on' and whilst we thought that was the end of it and started getting the bill, the beautiful singer started to sing it!! My daughter then uncontrollably started walking to the stage (looked hypnotised) and froze in front of the stage in amazement, only to be taken on stage and sing together with the singer until the end of the song! We then heard a round of applause from the restaurant guests and my wife nearly started bursting out in tears from the emotional joy for the wonderful experience that my little girl had...This was one dinner that we will never forget for our first visit to Singapore. It made us want to visit Singapore again and will likely choose to stay at Fullerton Bay Hotel next time (we stayed at MBS this time)Thank you Shye, the beautiful lady singer and pianist for making our last night at Singapore truly memorable! We will be back

The quality and amount of food for the Heritage afternoon tea are indeed impressive and worth the trip! You can request for additional free flow of any food items you enjoyed, almost like a ala-carte buffet. The selection of exquisite tea and coffee is also wide. The ambience was excellent with very comfortable seating (ask for the sofa seats on the sides and corners) and deco. There was also a pianist and singer on-site. However the service level can be further improved. Maybe it is the year end with more customers and the dining hall is big, however it was quite difficult to get the attention of the waiters and waitresses. They seem to assign certain waiter or waitresses to us, however the coverage is large and usually we ended up trying to get the attention of another waiter or waitress serving the other areas. Even for payments, it took a while. And based on observations, other guests seem to face the same experience. Hope the management can improve this aspect so that the overall experience is more pleasant

Our family booked the Christmas Lunch st the Fullerton Bay Hotel Clifford Pier Room and we couldn’t have been more pleased with the setup. The Smorgasborg was so extensive it had everything and to to off the day the staff sang Christmas Carols, they could have easily been a choir of done sort they err so good, well done. Would do it again. Well done Fullerton Bay Hote
5
Had dinner at this restaurant to celebrate my wedding anniversary. Cosy ambience, good food and great live jazz music. The hotel staff surprised us with a treat (chocolate cake) for the special occasion, which was really sweet
5
This is the second time that different colleagues chose this as a lunch venue - and it’s easy to see why. The setting is so elegant with a choice of western and Asian dishes all of which, in keeping with the surroundings, are refined and beautifully presented. (We had the Hainan chicken rice and the lobster roll.)There is also enough space between the tables to enjoy conversation without raising your voice and also without being overheard
4
Met an old friend here for lunch. Many executive types as it's in the CBD. It's a pretty restaurant in the fullerton bay hotel with an open concept on the lobby levelHad overpriced local food. My bachor noodles is ok. My friend barely touched her fried kway teow as it was too sticky for her. The kueh pie tie was o
4
Service was a bit slow to begin with, but when they changed staff halfway through our seating, it improved dramatically. This was a great free-flow high tea (all items on the stand can be replaced). Decor in Fullerton Bay Hotel is gorgeous. If they improved the service, this place would be outstanding
4
A high end kind of dim sum buffet. Lots of variety of asian food but little kinds of dim sum. Nice ambience... can go for a short photoshoot as the place is nicely decorated.
3
We were blown away by the ambience and historical values. Such a monument and landscape. Unfortunately we were letdown by the quality of food and service. Appears to be a catering venue than a restaurant.
3
Not much variety, although food was pretty alright. The traditional kuehs were nice only.Great ambiance looking view of the pier.Will not go back there unless itâ€™s fre
4
The restaurant decor made me think of Amitav Gosh trilogy books. The old colonial style dominates the modern converted warehouse design. The views over Marina Bay and the light show at night are amazing. And the food - almost an accessory given the ambiance - is good too
5
We were staying at The Fullerton (the converted heritage Post Office .. absolutely fantastic) across, or rather 'under' the road, from The Clifford Pier restaurant in Singapore.Because the food was exceptional, the ambience extraordinary (google the venue and location and you'll understand) and service top class, we ate there twice during our stay in Singapore, once for lunch and once for dinner. Both experiences were fantastic, the menu laced with traditional 'fare' such as the satays, soup Kambing and 'Chicken Rice', but the Lobster Roll and the Prawn Laksa (with lobster) were to die for.The service was excellent, attentive, but not overly, and the wine list extensive. We loved the French Chablis ... and a couple of 'local' ales for starters!The Restaurant has a number of low lounge type booths, which were, or could add that little extra to a romantic dinner. There was a pianist present playing subdued music the night we had dinner.I can thoroughly recommend this venue to add that extra memory to your trip to Singapore, where the competition for great food is extremely high

We were recommended by friends in Singapore to bring our friends for their wedding anniversary to high tea at Clifford Pier, it began bad we arrived 10 min early told to go away and come bsck in 10 min not ready lots of seats inside why not just seat us offer water or a drink??? Came back 10 min later told we were in wrong place 10 min earlier they had our booking found the french lady rude the other lady stepped in all good . Sat down placed coffee / tea orders 15 min later still waiting chased with a different waiter from then on everything was great, food service all what we had expected from a Fullerton. Great selection of local foods would go back

I came across some websites featuring The Clifford Pier at The Fullerton Bay Hotel Singapore, and it was wow, so stunning, so beautiful! I looked for more information and what they offer that I actually could try. There were quite a few interesting options such as Dim Sum Lunch, Heritage Afternoon Tea, Dinner buffet (which not available during my visit period), for example. I decided to do the Heritage Afternoon Tea, so I sent them a mail to reserve a table for only myself. I have requested a comfy sofa seat by the window so I could enjoy the view of Marina Bay outside.The reservation date had arrived, and I showed up before the actual time. I got a table with comfortable sofa by the window as requested. The table could actually accommodate a whole family of 6! Really appreciated their kind assistance on this!The staff here, I must say, everyone was so attentive. They came around and asked whether everything was alright, or anything they could do for me, or anything I might need. Excellent service from friendly staff!Now the food, the savoury local dishes were absolutely lovely. With this one meal, I could tried many kinds of local food such as chilli crab with mantou, stewed pork belly with bun, wagyu beef rendang that came with risotto, many other things!I also had a glass of lovely Moscato too. I only could have one pot of Vanilla Bourbon tea, was lovely too. For the desserts & sweets, I must say that since I didn't have lunch that day, so I had too much of savoury that I only could have a few small bites of the sweets. I think the desserts were just normal, although scones were pretty good!On top of all, I came to The Clifford Pier to enjoy myself in a beautiful atmosphere and I had it all. I really had a fantastic time here even though I was alone.Next time, I would definitely come back with people I love to share this lovely experience with them. Thank you The Clifford Pier for such a great time

Had a birthday celebration there and they gave a complimentary slice of cake! There was also live lounge music and it was nice that the singer sang a birthday song as well!Ambience was excellent! Was given a choice of buffet or ala carte. Went with the latter as the buffet had limited choices and they didn't look too appetizing having left there all night (particularly the salmon sashimi). Prices were a bit steep but that is to be expected of a restaurant in a luxury hotel.Overall a great dining experience! My 2nd time there and more to come :
5
I had the Singapore Heritage Afternoon Tea and it was amazing. The dining area is spacious, beautifully decorated with an abundance of natural light. There's ample spacing between tables. Table linen and cutlery were clean.The sweets are served to the table and the savouries lined up in a buffet; with some live stations. There was a good spread of dishes (mainly local food) and all are tasty. Service was excellent. The waiters and managers were attentive and would attend to you promptly
5
I love a lot of the buildings in Singapore and wanted to have a look at the interior and it was wow..... so we stayed for lunch. It was pricey but the quality, tastes etc. Were wonderful and the ambience. They have afternoon tea ... would have loved to have sampled that in thoses exquisite surroundings.... we are heading out again in march and definitely putting that on my to do list...
5
Most items in the menu are local dishes so it seemed overpriced to locals like us. However ingredients are of high end and high quality and the great colonial design and ambiance make up for it.
5
Great ambience, quality food, comfy seats & relax piano pieces! My hubby & I, even our toddler enjoyed there!
5
A very beautiful and quiet environment. Wait staff are friendly and efficient. Food is tasty and portion more than decent.
4
restraunat was slightly barny but atmospheric enough to be worth while. food was excellent but like most of singapore exy but well done, in this part of town.
5
The first step into the hotel and I know I have come to the right hotel. Love the excellent ambience and live music by the pianist. Service was undeniably excellent. Food was scrumptious. It was the perfect afternoon date with the spouse.
4
We had a lovely lunch here although they had sold out of 2 of the dishes we ordered. Great service and reasonably priced for where it is and the room is beautiful. We did see a wedding here also throughout our stay and it looked magnificent.
4
The Clifford Pier cafe is restored and refurbished from an actual working pier of the same name! It has a beautiful setting and great to spend a relaxing time for lunch or coffee. The food is nice, but I personally think can be better, and it's not cheap. It may not be a good dinner place, but can come after dinner for a nightcap.
5
I love coming to The Clifford Pier! Great ambience, live piano music and tasty food. Finally had an opportunity to try their Singapore Heritage Afternoon Tea ($48). Comes with a choice of tea/coffee, 8 savoury and 8 sweet items. Best of all the items are refillable!
5
The Clifford Pier Resaurant is not only beautiful but has an elegant old colonial style and feel to it. The food is exceptional, I had the sea bass. I also had my first ever Singapore Sling cocktail there! We happened to be there on an evening they had a pianist and singer. It was a wonderful evening and the views are beautiful. I found it to be extremely romantic! Enjoy!!!
5
I was thoroughly pleased with the afternoon tea sets at Clifford Pier. Having the menu on the table acted as a guide to all the yummy delights. The bao and the carrot cake were especially good. The wait staff were attentive and helpful as we had a baby with us. Loved the piano player too! Plus, the view out the wall of glass was beautiful. Love this plac

Took afternoon tea at Clifford Pier which is a very pleasant venue. Delicious heritage menu with a good selection of delicacies. Also a good range of teas. Coffee also available for those that prefer it.Experience was marred by poor service and inattentive staff
5
I stayed at the Fullerton Hotel Singapore (near the Fullerton Bay hotel).I was walking by the bay and came to the Clifford Pier by chance.I went in and was amazed at the beauty of the place.I think anyone who comes to Singapore should at least try to have dinner here once
5
The Clifford Pier has turned into a very charming restaurant with great ambience and food. It is a good place to chill out in the evening after the office crowds and cars are gone. We went for the buffet and were pleased with the quality of their seafood/shell fish - from fresh oysters to prawns, clams to sashimi. The roast beef was good but the oriental meats were not quite there. They have a 1 for 1 house wines during happy hours till 8pm and we had both the reds and whites and they were great. We forgot to ask for tap water and was served still and sparkling water which was very costly. The pianist sang well and that enhance the dining experience. Make your reservations ahead of time as it is always full from Fridays to Sundays, and ask for tap water if you are not particular about having your water branded
4
We went to The Clifford Pier for High Tea on a weekend. The ambience is extravagant to say the least. The open concept with its plush sofas and contemporary décor coupled with beautiful chandeliers gives a very old-world rich feel. The food on the other hand is mostly local or a fusion of Asian and intercontinental dishes (e.g. wagyu rending risotto - beautiful combination btw!). What was a little disappointing was the variety of options in the spread. Perhaps I disappoint myself due to my own extravagant expectations for I was there for high tea after all and seemed to be expecting a dinner spread?
4
I went for the heritage hi-tea here with my husband on his birthday. I've actually been to quite a number of hotels for afternoon tea, but none has accommodated for birthday requests. So I didn't pinned on much hope when I made this reservations via chope.co, and briefly mentioned "husband's birthday". When we were in the midst of enjoying the local delicacies, the staff came up to my husband with a slice of rainbow cake and sang happy birthday song to him. There was also a pianist playing the birthday song. I was wowed at the gesture, noting that we weren't even doing lunch/dinner. Service was impeccable right from reception till we left. Food was good - we added the laksa sampling portion. The laksa broth was thick and they don't stinge on the ingredients even though it was a sampling portion. I would definitely be back and would highly recommend this place.
3
The ambience at Clifford Pier is great to be honest, for all occassions. However, the food we had was nothing out of the ordinary. The lobster roll my girlfriend had was just okay and the medium rare beef steak could be so much better. A return visit would only be for the ambience
4
I confess I went to this restaurant not for the food but for the ambience. I love the high curved ceiling, the views from the restaurant and the feeling of spaciousness. The food is not bad. Wagyu rendang, laksa and satay are good. The popiah was below average. One or the snacks they serve is the addictive Malay snack made from nuts, batter, herbs and anchovies - I think is called rempeyek. On my last visit, my enjoyment was marred by a fishy stench as I entered the restaurant. What could it be? It was alarming. Later, I realized the smell was from a display of fresh fish at the entrance. Perhaps not ideal especially as the fish deteriorates upon exposure and stinks by evening
4
Great ambience with nice local food uniquely prepared. Restaurant is big and hard to get the attention of service staf
5
I find that upon our arrival from door step to restaurant reception, the hotel staffs were very welcoming. We were given the best table. Staff was accomodating with extending our table reservation as I had to ring up from airport as our flight into Singapore got delayed. Afternoon tea was fantastic, not many restaurants feature such local heritage style. As we had guests from overseas, we were happy that we could offer them some Nanyang style delicacies in a grand ambience. It wasn't noisy despite there was live singing so we could converse with ease. We had a pleasant time here. Thank you
4
The atmosphere was perfect and food generally decent. Service staff seemingly unattentive and sometimes were too anxious to clear the plates (even though there were still food on the plate). Do ask for the standard menu as that was left out in our visit
4
Mix of traditional and western items on the menu. Everything we had was well presented and tasted good. Food came quickly but the service was not great. Good value for the location and the restaurant was very comfortable and bright. Would recommend.
5
The beauty of this restaurant is unparalleled. The food is always excellent - great place to get Heritage Food.
3
Gorgeous, luxe, bright surroundings make for a delightful spot for afternoon tea. The Clifford Pier puts a local twist on high tea - serving up eight savory and eight sweet treats all featuring local flavors. The high points (for us) were the Pork Kong Bak Bao, Chili Crab Bao, and the the Beef Rendang Croquettes. We were quite full after the savories, which was okay - as traditional asian sweets are usually too spongy for our liking. High marks for the scones though - especially the version studded with tropical fruit. The service, however, leaves much to be desired. We struggled to get drinks (both cocktails an the complimentary hot beverages), water refills, extra croquettes, the bill, etc). Part of the indulgence of high tea is the feeling of being pampered; alas, we were not afforded this luxury. We were also disappointed that the piano player only played two "sets" of about four songs each. We would've really enjoyed his music for the duration of our afternoon respite
4
I had the National Day brunch there with my family and parents and the ambiance was lovely and relaxing. However the selection of food and quality is mediocre
2
We ordered 2 lobster rolls, 1 jumbo lumpy crabmeat pasta and 1 spaghetti vongolle. Only the spaghetti vongolle was acceptable, the other 3 were served almost immediately after we ordered, which were only slightly warm and rather average in taste and quality of produc
4
Had the Heritage Dim Sum Buffet brunch there, and the food was slightly higher than average as some dishes were abit cold. However, the service was really good, they constantly refilled our tea, and cleared our plates. Atmosphere was perfect, there was even live music, a guy playing the piano and singing. Enjoyed our time there
2
Asked the first waiter who served us tea for warm water-he never returned. Asked a second waiter for warm water, he offered two glasses to the next table. A very young waiter, suspect they are not properly trained. Went to the laksa station, the server took a long time to prepare the food, eventually I noticed he missed out an ingredient iny laksa bowl, i pointed out to him but he insisted he had put it in. Total blur. And at the ice cream station, the server put my ice cream cone on the surface of the cart while scooping ice cream. He could've left it in the cone box! Laksa was too salty, yong tau foo was too hard. U would've guessed by now we were there for the national day high tea. Very expensive buffet for low quality food. Their normal high tea is much more impressive, this pales in comparison
5
Just leaving the Clifford Pier after attending their National Day event. The evening started not so well due to where we were seated however, the manager Shye did a wonderful job of moving us to a better location and making sure everything was good with the evening. This was a great example of a class hotel solving a problem - thanks Shye, you should be commended for your work! The food was excellent, really good free flow wonderful entertainment - happy 52nd birthday Singapore!
4
Embience is great. Live music / singing liven up the feel too. Food average with limited menu choices. Local delights with western food available. Price slightly at the high side but worth it given it's nice set up attentive services and cozy embience. Don't forget to ask for credit card promotion for up to 15% off. Great place for gathering. Couple would love it too. Ask for sofa seating if you plan to stay the whole night for chatting.
4
It was the very first time to dine during afternoon tea session and I must say the overall experience was still an enjoyable one. Though the service was abit too attentive to my table as few servers came and asked about our orders; repetitively which need us to repeat again that either we do not need the service or orders have already been made through another service staff.
5
excellent leisurely lunch and a great opportunity to try some local Singaporean food, which was beautifully cooked and presented.
4
Good local fare in a historic setting, one of the few remaining restored historic buildings of Singapore. Very elegant ambience , entertainment with live music and great service. Can walk out to patio with Harbour view. Good for entertaining overseas guests
4
I have not had dinner at Clifford Pier for a while. The food standard has been kept but service is still below expectation especially in case of the reception staff. They are not only unhelpful to the customers but also to their fellow staff. If they are being pay just to act like decorations, then I will suggest that the management can install a sculpture when ch will be more attractive.
4
When we feedback that the clams in the vongole dish has sand in it, They were quick to offer alternative options to compensate for that dish. Staff were also friendly and smiley. The food didn't impress us but we liked the ambience and the singer on stage had a great voice!
5
A group of us dinner at The Clifford Pier for a Celebratory lunch. Clifford Pier is a Singaporean historical landmark that has been lovingly restored into a top notch restaurant. To see how it's transformed is a truly fantastic assault on the senses but to dine here capped the experience off. The fare was local and Chinese Dim Sum and the selection was superb despite my vegetarian requirements. The staff were excellent, attentive without being too overbearing, a great balance. The ambience was sublime, just wanted to stay there and soak it all up along with the excellent pianist.This is a must do experience and feel so glad we came here
4
The place was lovely for friends to catch up over afternoon tea. Good spread of sweet and savoury options for high tea but would be better if the food was warmer
4
Though service is not fantastic, the ambience is good. Menu has now more choices, although I missed so,me of the local stuff that has been taken off.
5
In one word? YUM.It's quite spectacular looking place from the outside and the inside - and even if you don't intend on dining there it's well worth the visit.Maybe it's not as well known as Raffles across the road, it the service and food is as good - we a spectacular view.I went on the Sunday and it was $48 for the buffet and unlimited tea and coffee. And I did. And I did enjoy myself.Well worth it - as I said even if to look at the amazing room
5
Great service, ambience & live music! Restaurant gave a complimentary birthday cake for my boyfriend's birthday celebration, very nice & thoughtful of them!

Went for the Heritage High Tea on 4 July as friend came for the high tea about 2 months ago and raved about it. The same friend brought me here to celebrate my birthday. Alas, the experience was way below our expectations. I have nothing much to say except that the restaurant setting was very nice, the kong bak bao, chilli crab bun and hot beverages were nice. Everything else was just average or poor... when we asked if this was a buffet (friend claimed that they used to state it was heritage high tea buffet on website when she booked in May, but the word buffet was dropped when she made the reservation for July...), the waiter who was serving us the tea said he doesn't know and ask us to check with his other colleagues :cMaybe you should just order from the a la carte menu or come just to catch up with friends over a cup of coffee or tea... the bill for high tea for two came up to about S$105 including taxes and service charges....Environment - 5Food (heritage high tea) - scones (2), savory items (3), chilli crab bun (5), long bak bao (5), sweet items (1)Food presentation - 2Service - 2.5Value for money - 1Really very disappointed with the experience... I hope they can improve.

Such a beautiful environment to enjoy High tea with live piano performances. The heritage food was great with a good range of food for a high tea session.
5
Excellent service, excellent food. Brought family friends here before proceeding for walk around marina bay waterfront. Reasonable hotel prices.

I attended a large event here that booked out the whole venue.
The building is spectacular and the location stunning.
The venue really worked well for a large group and the food was very good for a big event.

I've always had a theory: restaurants with great views have mediocre, to lousy food! Clifford Pier seems to want to prove this theory true.One of the reasons why I keep returning to this place with foreign guests is because of how charmingly beautiful it is and how great a view it has -- Marina Bay Sands over the water. The food is only passable for the expensive price paid -- thankfully my foreign guests are usually none the wiser for the food quality. I would only eat the local food at the Clifford Pier, because of its air-conditioned & beautiful setting. On cooler nights I would, instead, bring my foreign guests to eat local food at Satay by The Bay, for a fraction of the cost.As you can read from previous reviews, service here needs a lot of work! To be fair, the place is a little too large for the existing staff to cover. Sometimes it's hard for the staff to see my frantically waving hands -- every other guest can see it! -- due to the size of the place. Human Resources and higher management need to actually get on the ground to try serving even half a house to understand how inadequate their current staffing is! The existing staff have no time to exchange pleasantries with guests, making them seem unfriendly. It seems that the distance from the kitchen to the Clifford Pier is rather far, which also causes the food to sometimes get from hot to lukewarm, or cold; this must be frustrating for the waitstaff, who have to handle all the guests' complaints. Don't get me started on the live music. It sounds cheap. But then again, I'm a music snob & have refined musical tastes. So now I avoid going to the Clifford Pier at dinner.Whenever I bring guests, I have to anticipate the poor service and pre-order items, or ask for the bill (discretely) before the meal is officially over, lest I have to wait even longer just to leave. If possible, I visit at off-peak hours -- ie not at lunch, tea & dinner -- to enjoy better service.I also agree with one of the reviewers that the hosts at the front of Clifford Pier are snooty and stand-offish. And as many times as I have revisited this place, neither of the hosts can remember me, yet the waitstaff always do!When Clifford Pier first opened I went there nearly every week. Then due to continued poor service, I stopped for several months, only to return to the "same old, same old". I can only guess that higher management is not actually hearing and acting on the feedback from the floor -- both guests and waitstaff. Well, perhaps the Fullerton Bay Hotel is happy with Clifford Pier's current state of affairs: a beautiful edifice, covering up expensive, average food with unhappy staff

The Singapore Heritage Afternoon Tea at The Clifford Pier is available from Mondays to Fridays at 3.30 to 5.30 pm at the price of $49++. The high tea came in three tiers of savouries and sweets. The chilli crab bao, pork kong bak bao and chill bak kwa on savoury egg tart are marvellous. However, the rest are simply disappointing. The kueh pie tee, carrot cake, wagyu beef croqueatas were cold while the scones were rather hard. Other than the service and ambience, the high tea is simply not value for money
3
The setting is really pretty, with colonial style furnishes and a view of the singapore river. It is also accessible to the river taxi and close to raffles place mrt. You just have to exit the station towards Chevron house, go to second level and cross the overhead bridge. The hotel is right below the stairs. Food tastes good for the affordable price of 32 (2 course) to 35 (3 course) for set lunch. It offers an interesting mix of Asian and western. A la carte prices are slightly more expensive, so would recommend the set. Set lunch is 12-230pm. However, the service is really slow, waited 20min for main, only arrived after a second call, waited very long for the bill as well. There is a man pushing a drinks/coconut cart which we thought was a bit out of place..
5
Went for the Heritage Dim Sum dinner buffet on father's day (They had a 50% off if you went in pairs, thats like 1-for-1, definitely good value for this promo) The oysters were really fresh, with a very on point crispiness to the fried tofu skin and ngoh hiang
3
Food quality was disappointing. The only item worth repeat -order was the Kong Ba Bao, and that is if you like pork. All the sweet items were forgettable; The savoury ones tasted mass-produced and pre-prepared.
3
We treated ourselves to the Clifford Pierâ€™s Singapore Heritage Afternoon Tea (SGD45++ per person) in luxurious surrounds that showcase the excellent contemporary design interpretation of the colonial era with live piano music in the background. The tea set comprises a 3 tier stand with local interpretations of savouries and sweets together with unlimited beverage options of various teas, traditional local coffee (kopi), teh tarik or rose syrup milk drink. Pros: nice to have a different variety incorporating local flavours than just the usual western version of sandwiches, cakes and scones. Waiting staff were all friendly and polite, and when they discovered we were there to celebrate our anniversary, they surprised us with a small and delicious decadent chocolate and ganache cake together with a souvenir postcard of the original Clifford Pier!Cons: Although tasty, unfortunately the food elements that was supposed to be hot/warm were already cold when they reached our table. The scones were especially hard, dense and dry. Suspect the tea set was made in advance, so it was not as fresh as it could have been which was disappointing.We were not able to finish all of our tea set yet we were told we weren't allowed to take away leftovers - even though we paid for it as a whole!Overall it was a unique experience of afternoon tea in luxurious surrounds
3
Food is average. Service is slow. Not value for money. Take quite a Long while for drinks order. Food variety limited
5
Dinner was excellent and service as well. Everything was fresh and cooked as it should be. Stay with the local style dishes and you cannot go wrong.

The Clifford Pier restaurant at the Fullerton Bay Hotel is absolutely stunning. The chandelier in the entrance is amazing. The view is perfect. Wonderful old Colonial feel and just utter luxury. They even bought me a stool to place my handbag on. Now that is style. One friend chose the Lobster Roll which she said was divine and the three of us had the spicy jumbo crab meat spaghetti which was excellent. Washed down with a bottle of New Zealand wine which was a tad expensive at 138 Singapore Dollars a bottle! The staff were attentive and friendly, the service impeccable - even going to far as to ensure we had reserved seats on the verandah after our dinner to watch the light show. Singapore Slings were bought to us on the verandah. A fabulous, fabulous experience and one that we all hope to repeat. Thank you all for making us feel so special, for giving us a fantastic meal which we are still talking about two months later. We do so hope we will be able to dine with you again
5
Great ambience and music was good. The beef steak was excellent. We were indeed surprised by a beautiful complimentary piece of chocolate cake for our wedding anniversary celebration
5
We were taken aback upon arrival. What a great setting and truly fabulous restaurant. The place is huge and comes complete with a classic singer and pianist. Service was superb, these guys have been trained to a professional standard. The quality of the food was great and not too expensive (which was a pleasant surprise). Will be back
5
I've been to Clifford Pier several times and the service has always been impeccable and consistent. I celebrated my fiancé's birthday this time and requested for a simple birthday dessert - they up it a notch with two fantastic desserts and a birthday song from the live band. Greatly appreciate their kind gesture.
5
A friend of mine very passionately recommended this place when I asked for suggestions for high tea places, and now I can clearly see why she is so in love with The Clifford Pier. Just the facade and decor of the restaurant alone make a striking first impression, but the food (we went for the Singapore Heritage High Tea) is truly the highlight - yummy, unique and worth the price tag (because it's a buffet). My personal favourite is the chilli crab bun! Would definitely recommend this just as passionately to someone else :
4
A most relaxing environment with live pianist singing in the background in this stunning restaurant where you can enjoy afternoon tea or coffee. The choice of local and western pastry are delectable. You can also enjoy the view of the bay outside. The wonderful news is the drink and choice of food may be refilled FOC. So choose your favorite piece such as the chilli crab bun, pork belly pau or the pie tee and make that second order again.

I was delighted to have been invited by a long lost friend to have a cup of afternoon coffee at this luxurious place. So imagine my excitement when my friend was instantly recognized by the head waiter or captain and was almost seated promptly.The decor and the furniture of this place was exquisite and excellent! The sofa seating at the corner was also extremely comfortable.Our orders were promptly ordered and was served with a greeting and a generous smile. The orders arrived but it seems that the waiter might have forgotten who ordered coffee and who ordered bandung (consists of rose syrup and milk) in which to me, its quite embarrassing and disappointing. My cup of coffee was served with milk but the waiter seems to have forgotten to serve together with the sugar bowl. My friend tried to get another waiter's attention and I noticed that it was only after he raised his voice a little then another waiter came by. It seems that the waiters didn't pay full attention to their patron's call for attention. This was also apparent when we were about to leave and my friend was trying to call for the bill.My friend also did ask for some chips or finger food to be brought but throughout the hour that we were there, it never came.The coffee served was of an excellent quality in which was the saving grace for this fine establishment.I would have given 5 out of 5 if it wasn't for the lack of attentiveness of the waiters there and also, not remembering what we ordered when serving
4
Overall good. Will come back here again. The savouries are good. The sweets are a bit too sweet for me. Good selection of tea.
5
Overlooking the mythical merlion and Singapore's iconic building Marina Bay Sands across the sea, with a glass of champagne made the atmosphere sophisticated and classy. The food was luscious, especially the cod fish is perfectly done. The place is the gem that one can hardly come by.
5
This restaurant was really a highlight.Friendly staff, good food, nice atmosphere, live music and a top outside location ar the terasse, especially at night time. I 100% come back.
5
Has a superb afternoon tea here. Lovely place and excellent service. Outside the views across to Marina Bay Sands Hotel are pretty good too
4
Decent place to have dinner after visiting Garden by the Bay. The price is reasonable and environment is very comfortable. Food variety is acceptable and staff are very helpful.
4
The food taste good as well as the presentation. The atmosphere was wonderful as it was perfect for a quite lunch meeting. The staffs were very attentive and professional
5
I like the resturant ambience. It is so comfortable, relaxing and cosy. The service staff is attentive & friendly. The food is nice. Their chin chow drink was mixed with soya bean and i cannot take soya bean so i requested to have chin chow with plain water, and they specially made it for me a cup. Thank you for your effort. I really appreciate it
5
Having an afternoon tea here is so fascinating. Good tea, good cake & good view is very wonderful ambiance
3
Was expecting a dim sum buffet dinner (as described on website) but turned out to be a hawker fare buffet. Interesting theme, though food was not impressive. Service staff were attentive and friendly.
5
I was over the moon with my lobster roll. Lobster was perfectly cooked and seasoned. The wee roll came with a disproportionately large portion of fries and a wee salad. I suppose if you were a guy you would be disappointed in the portioning. But I have a small appetite and was ecstatic about being served this understated piece of perfection. Flavours 10/10, freshness 10/10, rubbery overcooked lobster - no way!Service was excellent and how to ignore the wonderful setting? I would happily hide in a corner with a book and a cup of earl grey. I have memories of Clifford Pier when it was still a dirty pier. Have you not cleaned up well? Beautiful hotel now and this eatery a highlight. Worth a stroll outdoors when the sun isn't blazing too brightly.Currently, The Clifford Pier is offering a buffet featuring Tiong Bahru hawkers. So if you like chwee kueh, lor mee, chai tao kueh, glutinous rice cakes, tao suan. Not my thing!
5
Loved this restaurant! Visited a couple of times during our stay and each time enjoyed it thoroughly. The room is simply stunning, service perfect and the food delicious..For us it was a perfect lunch stop, to be out of the heat, eating and drinking in such opulent surrounds.
5
Great place to unwind and relax after a tough week at work or a pace to just take some time off away from city life.Good and attentive staff who never fails to meet your expectations
5
Beautiful place, with good local food, excellent service. Brought some friends from overseas to try good local food in a nice ambience.
5
Staff was very friendly and warm. Food is good. Place is beautiful and spacious, ideal for business meetings, date or family
3
Quality of food was pretty good, nice ambience, great service, a little pricey for the selection. But the big sofa makes it great for family gatherings.
4
The restaurant was very beautiful and the food and drinks were very nice. The view was fantastic. Will go again.
3
The location is nice being in an old ferry terminal. High ceilings and open layout, comfortable seating. Tables are not too close together. Savoury dishes are in buffet style and sweets are served to your table. Would say what made this experience good instead of great was the service. When we arrived, we were waiting for one more friend, we asked to have ice water while we waited. We had to ask 3 times. When we finally did order tea, we were served tea, but no tea cups until we asked if we could have some tea cups. The waiter looked surprised also that we had no tea cups. At around 4:30pm, we were served our bill. This was quite off-putting as we were still eating and drinking our tea. We asked if we could pay once we were done and the waiter said ok. We understood tea was at least served until 5pm. At around 5pm, another waitress brought us another bill. And while several tables were still eating, they began cleaning up the afternoon tea buffet and setting up booths for dinner (?) right next to our table. Was a bit disappointing and kind of ruined the nice, relaxing atmosphere. Although, it is a lovely venue and location, would have to think twice to join afternoon tea here again.
3
Was there for business. Nice ambience with good service. Staff are attentive and friendly, striking small conversation with us. Restaurant serves a good selection of famous local cuisines. Tried the wagyu beef rendang, laksa, chicken rice and satay. Teh tarik is fragrant and meet expectation. Nonetheless, prices are expensive for those mentioned above and not really a place for such local delights. Nonetheless, good place for business talks
3
Food was ok, with only 1 or 2 dishes to shout for. Service was mediocre, often forgetting what I've requested and they were more in a hurry to clear the crowd. May not return
5
Both my friend and I liked their savory selection more than the sweet, but nevertheless, food was still amazing. What was even better was the service. Every single staff was proactive and took care of our needs even before we asked.
5
Had a really good experience at the restaurant. Staffs were attentive and selection of good was great. Loved the savoury bites most. Will definitely visit again soon
5
We got together at The Clifford Pier around 9 pm. We were easily seated in the outdoor section overlooking the bay. This was our first time seeing the lights and we quite impressed. Two of us ordered desserts (Key Lime Pie and Banana Fritters) and one ordered Fish and Chips. We thought the food was excellent. We thought the price was reasonable given the view. We'd do it again
3
You are paying for the decor and atmosphere. I guess the plave is great at tea time but a dinner time it's less amazing.There's a singer and pianist.Food is ok but very local selection menu.Portions are slightly small
2
We returned to this restaurant after taking my family there while in Singapore for Christmas 2014, then it was a wonderful experience but this time we were bitterly disappointed.We sat out the front, amongst the clutter of furniture pushed to one side as a group of people played at modelling or whatever, to have a couple of drinks. After 25 minutes of being ignored by staff we gave up and went inside to be seated not where we had asked when booking 3 days previously.But the big disappointment was the food; my entree of popiahs were over cooked, greasy and chewy while my wife's calamari was also overlooked and tasted on of old cooking oil.My hamburger was sickly sweet and the rendang was barely passable.All this was compounded by the whopping bill......Wow, not only was it the most expensive meal we had in Singapore but the worst......what happened to the wonderful experience we had in 2014 ????. Sure, the ambience was good and the singer a nice touch but the rest of our experience meant we will never return
5
Watch the sky change during sunset and enjoy the lovely ambience and very attentive service at The Clifford Pier. A range of different foods to choose from, something for every palate. The atmosphere is elegant but not too stiff.
5
high class place. maintained the old world charm. high end for buffet dinner but their spread is wide and food are tasty. the roasted pork belly is crispy on the outside but soft and tender on the inside. same for the roasted rib eye. oyster is fresh and sweet. smoked salmon, seasoned squids etc. dessert is also wide spread - bread pudding, ice cream, jelly in a cup etc.. coffee / tea not included in buffet price.good place for gathering, not noisy since charges are on the high side, so no rowdy crowd. think prior reservation is required
3
We had dinner at The Clifford Pier after a long day walking around the city. We chose the restaurant for location and its menu, and being part of The Fullerton we knew it would be good quality. The food was nice enough, A chicken curry and the farmers salad along with truffle fries. With an atmosphere set by a singer and pianist. It was not however beyond what we expected, and we would possibly be disappointed if it was the same in an upmarket hotel at home. Also to note the Marina bay sands no longer to their light show at the moment as we went to sit outside to watch this.
4
~our boss arranged for us to meet our new boss for dinner here last 2016May, our team went off the beaten path to the new Fullerton Bay Hotel and along the water's edge to their grand entrance~located in a beautifully restored structure, The Clifford Pier exudes luxury and recreates a bygone ear of old Singapore opulence (ikr you just gotta visit)~evening lights and service was especially polite and unhurried, actually a nice touch ~the menu OMG it's kopitiam dishes and many local favorites souped up with something High Class, while nothing seems out of place, being a local guest is out of placed... I'm all for paying menu price but not used to paying for local dishes at these prices (but I wasn't paying) PHEWWagyu Beef Rendang - AMAZING YUMz (and dry)Teh Tarik Ice Cream - very Good but I wouldn't yet couldn't say why it shouldn't be ice creamed and worse I can't explain why I chose this for my dessert either (it's because Teh Tarik is a hot tea drink served after being tumbled cool) not for one to ignore good food, this is a different spin on local foods made good at at least an attempt to justify why. I like the way the menu is created to appeal to locals as well as visitors who may want to sample some local dishes (um somewhat) but for the authentic taste of Singapore it's priced way lower and never sold in a restaurant such as this :) Come for special occasions, the view, the location, the history, the heritage, your date, your valentine, your weddings... there are many reasons to visit... for the food you gotta be a local taste adventurer with deep pockets or totally unfamiliar with local dishes to appreciate them for the first time here

We have been coming here since the opening, to showcase to visiting guests the impressive transformation of a working pier into a splendid restaurant with a spectacular view of MBS. For that unique ambience, we will continue to come. However, while slowly improving with the years, food and service continue to be sub-par. The dishes, whether local, Asian or western, are slightly below what you can get at more modest outlets in town, to downright terrible (e.g. chilli crab, Vietnamese chả giò, etc). Also not practically plated for optimum enjoyment. Service is friendly, but not alert: we ordered two camomile teas; one came a full 10 minutes after the other, as we were about to leave
4
Except for one staff the rest were courteous and extremely polite and attentive. Food was great and delicious and they provide free dessert and bread.
5
We brought some visitors who wanted to taste the local cuisine. The ambience is in the old pier with a rich history and the doors open to the bayside walk to the Merlion and beyond. Not just a scenic setting, but also great local food - Bak Kut Teh, lobster roll, prawn laksa, heritage bites which included small portions of kueh pie ti and other delights. The local beverages add to the meal - bandung, Chin chow, Teh tarik. Banana fritters and pulot hitam were flavoursome desserts. Service was great
5
This is our second visit to a Fullerton based restaurant and I must again congratulate management on training such wonderfully cheerful and helpful staff. The wait staff were all smiles, and extremely quick on their feet. We were here for a birthday celebration and waiter Zaw Zaw saw to it that we had our free birthday cake coordinated with a live piano piece of "happy birthday" when the cake arrived. A truly special moment! Apart from the truly 5 star wait staff, the ambiance could not have been better. They have kept the original interior of the old Clifford Pier and the place just oozes with nostalgia. The seats however were a bit more plush to our liking and sank significantlyFood wise it was excellent. A must try for the lobster roll, soup kambing, chicken and beef satay, and top hats. Their menu consists of both local and western delights though we would have preferred it to have more western choices. Also the beer and wine list were somewhat limited (I think the restaurant was geared more towards high tea).Parking was free too which was the cherry on the cake!A very satisfying dinner overall
5
This place is fantastic, The building itself is on the river with view on marina bay sand and the bay. The food is not too expensive for the place and the service is royal. Go there for anniversary parties, or for romantic dinner
5
Was here for the dim sum brunch! Stunning place and decor, high ceilings, helpful servers (don't recommend sitting at the corners because it was a little difficult to get their attention from there) and serves one of the best buffet food I've eaten, quality and taste wise. Definitely a recommended, must-go place
4
We had brunch here yesterday. The food was good and quite interesting but nothing special. Very little was "cooked to order". Mostly pre cooked and in the usual metal containers. The trolley was fun and the ribs and buns were good. No "wow factor " though which was a disappointment for a hotel of this standard. A bit tired and in need of a rethink. The only Western pudding was ice cream. We didn't enjoy the other desserts. This was our first visit and I doubt we will return. Staff here and in other parts of the hotel where we wandered about - including the Bar where we had a glass of bubbles - were delightful and very helpful. The views are fantastic and the setting is lovely.
3
Pros:- Wide selection of food during the buffet dinner- Great presentation- Amazing view of the bay & MBS- Good service staffCons:- Food is nothing to shout home about, especially for a restaurant in the hotel of that standard
4
Eating in this historic pier is an elegant affair. We enjoyed the buffet and it was comprehensive and quite jolly. Great selection of food items, especially local foods to Singapore such as Indian, Chinese and Malaysian.After your dinner, nip to the Lantern bar on the roof for a cocktail with a view
4
My mother visits every two years or so. She loves high tea. As a local resident for the last nine years, I need to rustle something up for her. After a disappointing visit to the Raffles Hotel, I am pleased to say, this is much better and twenty dollars cheaper. The ambience is vastly superior - Clifford Pier offers a relaxed, yet stylish afternoon tea experience. The restaurant is spacious, the seats comfortable, the unobtrusive music is tasteful and jazzy, and the Aircon is not too cold. Service is solicitous, friendly and professional.The food is ok. Clifford Pier is all about fusion. A criticism often heard is that you can get their food better and cheaper at a food court. Perhaps, but not in style and with such marvellous surroundings. The high tea offers local food buffet style. Today there was a specific Chinese New Year theme. Once that has passed, the choice may be different. The high tea tray features ok scones, too little clotted cream and fusion or Asian sweets. The tea is very good and plentiful.In summary - we are still not quite there with the high tea experience, but so far it is the best I have been able to find in terms of atmosphere and acceptable food offerings
4
This is the first time we had our afternoon tea at The Clifford Pier. Since it is the Lunar New Year season, there is an additional surcharge per person as per the staff when we made our bookings a few weeks ago. The canapÃ©s and desserts come in a set and can be replenish as many times we like. The Lunar New Year snacks include the love letters, kong bak bao, pineapple snacks, cookies and so forth. We would hope to see something more special and not what we could easily get outside. Frankly speaking we were a little disappointed. Note that reservations a few weeks in advance is a must to avoid any disappointment. Remember to check for credit card discounts. We were not informed for the UOB discounts but luckily this was the card we used.Anyway, the food is average but the restaurant is really pretty and the ambience is great
4
As we were staying at the Fullerton we went here for lunch. Beautiful location and good service. Food choice was a bit limited but quality was good, but as you would expect for this location a bit pricey. Very central location and a great area to walk around afterwards. Worth a visit
4
High tea from 3:30 to 5:30: I was a bit nervous going to this restaurant because the reviews were not that great, but I"m glad we took the chance and went. It was expensive, but a beautiful setting and the service was great. The food was great too. It is a set menu, they bring you different foods and you can order more of anything you choose. We didn't like everything, but it was nice to try different local foods and not go away hungry. You could just order more of what you did like. The TWG unlimited tea was superb and you could try different ones as well. We loved it
4
Came here for a business event. The interior was nicely decorated. The location is good as it is centrally located and reachable by public transfer such as Raffles Place MRT. One can walk through the restaurant and at the other end will be a view of Marina Bay Sands.
5
From good to wine to service everything was tip top! Our vistors thoroughly enjoyed the evening! We'll definitely bring our next guests there again.
4
Beautiful dining in comfortable sofas. Enjoy the local fare here. Limited menu but quite good. Service was also excellent.
5
Given the majestic Fullerton, beautiful view and top quality food, La Brasserie is very moderately priced.
4
Good place to have business lunch with a good view of Marina Bay. Serve local delight. Business set lunch is value for money.
4
Went to the Clifford Pier Restaurant for afternoon tea. Decided to enjoy the open air and take in the incredible view over marina bay. The armchairs are very comfy, the service was great as well ! the prices are fair for such a location. A nice place to relax after a long day in the heat of Singapor
3
My mum and I went there for lunch. The restaurant and surroundings are beautiful. Servers are wonderful and polite. The food is generally great although I feel that the Claypot Nonya red snapper curry can be improved. It is not bad but something is missing. I cannot put my finger on it. But overall a very pleasant lunch.

Reflecting back on our trip, this restaurant is the only negative experience we had - both with service and food quality which is very unfortunate because it is a beautiful place with a great view. After a long day of sight seeing, Clifford Pier was one of the few restaurants open on New Years Day. We were jet lagged and had been out in the sweltering heat all day. The hostess made us feel like we were not good enough to eat at their establishment - more than half the tables empty and servers standing - no one in waiting area but yet she told us there were 2 tables ahead of us. We evaluated our options and came back to a different hostess who seated us immediately. We ordered the burger. It was the chewiest hamburger we have ever eaten in our lives. And coming from Texas - and eating a LOT of burgers - we can both say this was the worst burger both my husband and I have EVER had in our lives! Burger king would have served us a better burger for 1/20th of the price! Overpriced and underwhelming. This is our first bad Trip advisor rating and our ONLY negative rating of many ratings while in Singapore
2
Came here for dinner the other night. I'd booked in advance and told them my food allergies at the time of the booking 24 hours before hand. When we arrived they couldn't cater to my allergies because one of them is in EVERYTHING on the menu. And I mean EVERYTHING. The chef had to come out and talk to me about what I could and couldn't eat. Ended up with a $30++ plain vegetable fried rice with tiny pieces of chicken. The salt and pepper I added into it added some flavor but still not worth $30++.All alcohol is SEVERELY overpriced and still have the ++ to be taken into consideration. Total bill for 2 ppl to have 1 entree, 2 mains and a drink each was $140.Would never come here again. Only gave it up to poor because the venue looked nice and the calamari entree was nic

The old Clifford Pier has been developed as a magnificent setting for a restaurant in the Fullerton Bay Hotel. The room is the feature - large, high ceilings, well spaced tables and great outlooks. The food is very good and on one visit, their feature buffet was available. The range and quality of the food was excellent and well priced. They still kept the a la carte options for those not interested in the buffet. The noise level is naturally low in such a setting, the service friendly and competent but the wines are very expensive ($25 per glass) and a limited choice is available . The solution - drink cocktails at the same price ! an
5
Having heard of how tastefully Clifford Pier has been refurbished, the 6 of us strolled in on Saturday 17th December evening and chanced upon the buffet spread being offered at $58++. The freshly shucked huge oysters lay besides the assorted sashimi, scallops and seafood whilst roast beef, turkey, ham lay on the other table. A row of cooked food, kongbak pow, chicken rice, satay etc was assembled next to the dessert, cakes and ice cream. Luck was with us as there was a display of antique classic cars in the lobby area. We chose to sit outside al fresco so as to view the laser light show from MBS across Marina Bay. Overall, it was a very pleasant evening
5
If you enjoy a classic high class environment and the historic style, you need to visit this place. You get a cup of tea or a coffee in a very nice and quiet atmosphere. You can just sit down and relax.
5
We were a group of four for afternoon tea and were seated at a table with a couch seating on one side and armchairs on the other. Quite comfortable. The savory buffet was extensive including chili crab soup, smoked salmon, small pies, fried rice dishes and baked salmon as well as savory tarts and delicious breads and more. The table delivered cake and scones tower included many delicious items and the pots of tea were very good with plenty of selections on offer.The desert buffet included molten chocolate to coat pieces of fruit and berries – altogether too tempting – as well as cake, and since it was approaching Christmas time, a gingerbread house.We shared a very good bottle of champagne and came away replete having thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The tab came to $550 so this wasn’t a budget event; but enjoyed and appreciated in grand surroundings

The Good - For our anniversary, my husband booked online a table for two to celebrate our Anniversary. They remembered and served us our cake. Thank you :) Loved the scenery, hotel decor and my companion. The Yummy - Crunchy Kueh Pie Tie, chewy Rainbow Lapis, Deep fried yam dumpling, Soup from Laksa dish and ice cream. The Bland - Mostly local food. Small spread of fried dim sum and steam dim sum dishes served from a trolley. It was bland and not served piping hot... The Sorry - The pianist came, stroke the keys to play two short pieces then exited for smokes before he returned and repeated the process. The Comparison - This (Heritage) Dim Sum Brunch is overpriced and boring. Would rather pay a little more to have a fulfilling chomp at Cherry Garden, Mandarin Oriental. The Verdict - Forgetable food + great scenery for two at around S$115.00. Worth it or not? You decide..

Had dinner with some colleagues for a birthday celebration. A yummy slice of cake was arranged without me asking which was great. Ambience here is fantastic. Met Sivan who is the outlet manager & is very impressed with his hospitality. Will definitely go back again

My table booking was booked under my husband Rick chew on 30/11/16. The foods was ok, but prior to my birthday, Fullerton did gave my husband a call and mentioned that there will be a complimentary cake on my birthday, unfortunately we wait and wait, no cake were serve! There is a table of guest who have his birthday today, the staffs gave him a cake and others. This will be my first and last time to Clifford

We decided to have our anniversary lunch here and we loved everything about it. The food was good, the ambience was bustling with activity and the staff really tried their best to be attentive despite the weekday lunch crowd. The ice cream dessert add on was the best choice of the meal, worth every penny of the $6 extra. Staff was generous to serve us 2 full bowls of fish crackers when we asked for it. Already am planning for my second visit with my parents!

We were feeling peckish but didn't want to spoil our appetite for dinner, so after exploring the Fullerton area, we retreated from the mid-afternoon heat and arrived at the stylish Fullerton Bay Hotel to have some drinks and snacks at the very inviting Clifford Pier. For drinks, we ordered the recommended Fullerton Express Tea, the Chin Chow Moon Walker and the Virgin Red Lantern. We also ordered the "Heritage Bites" - a platter of Kong Bak Bao, Kueh Pie Tee and Grilled Satay. The platter had generous portions. There was a substantial chunk of Kong Bak Bao (braised pork in dark sauce) served in each steamed bun, but the meat was unfortunately dry and a bit tough to chew on. The Kueh Pie Tee is a popular Peranakan dish with julienned vegetables and prawns served in thin and crispy tart shells. The Fullerton Bay version deviated with the addition of quail's eggs. It was still quite delicious. The third item was satay, a local (and tourist) favourite. The grilled chicken and beef on skewers were both sweet and tender, and were the highlight of the selection of "Heritage Bites". The Virgin Red Lantern looked pretty in pink, with cucumber slices swimming around in the watermelon juice, with a hint of lime and undetectable sugarcane juice. It was visually pleasing and was quite a refreshing drink. Unfortunately the recommended Fullerton Express Tea ("white tea with crystalline infusion of highly aromatic wildflowers") did not deliver - it was far too light...and forgettable. The Chin Chow drink with the fancy "moon walker" name was also a let-down. It tasted like a diluted version of soy milk poured out from a cheap "Tetra Pak" packaging served with slices of grass jelly, a popular Asian jelly-like dessert ingredient. We still had a lovely time. The Clifford Pier serves quite a lot of hawker and local fare, including a local afternoon tea. It is a beautiful place to relax, with frequent live piano performances. Another place to consider for an afternoon breather is The Landing Point, which is a cosier, more private place tucked away in a corner further in from the hotel lobby.

This is definitely a non value for money stop in Singapore. Average food, limited menu choices and moderate service. Great location though. It would be a landmark in this city, but..
5
Me n my friend decided for a belated birthday luncheon and then it turned out to be a lunch plus high tea plus dinner in one go. We had all we asked for and the team was always attempting to read our next order. Compliments to all at Clifford pier n we'll be back Highly recommended for all 3 occasions
4
despite being dim sum brunch the items were limited.But there was many local hawker food so not so disappointed and some snacks found in olden days.Dim sum wheeled around with trolleyand piping hot.though abit pricey but with lavish ambience and awesome view worth the value for money.It has a classy setting with a relaxed ambience.The service is first class with a group of well trained staff.Though the food is not so extraordinary,overall is a great dining experience for me and my hubby,especially thanks Mohan for providing a good service

Wow!! What a spectacular location and menu.
The main restaurant is designed to be pure colonial elegance and totally hits the mark. The food was divine.
A fantastic venue for any special occasion or for a work meeting.
5
You walk in and expect to have a typical fancy hotel (which this is) food experience and yet the food is surprisingly good. A bit pricey but good food with good service, a lovely view and a fantastic live singer all combined to make this a great meal
5
I am so in love with Clifford Pier. I have been coming here for dinner every month or so. The ambience is perfect. It has high ceilings and beautiful huge arched windows. The singer and pianist serenade the evening crowd with lovely old school tunes. I've sampled most of the food from the menu. The food generally nothing memorable. Steak is not too bad though
3
Great ambience with live music, service wise was friendly however forgotten one of our orders, food selection was mainly coffee house food selectio
5
The ambience is beckoning and so is the cuisine. The high ceilings, the smartly dressed chefs and service staff, and the orchids take you back to an era of the colonial times. The tea list is long and feature combinations like Vanilla Bourbon, English breakfast and also coffee. High tea is a delectable spread of local Chinese, Indian, and Malay cuisine. You will be able to indulge in chili crab with man tou, roti canai and chicken curry, braised pork and steamed bun, salads, pie tee and so forth.To top it up you can find a combination of hot puffs and also Nyonya Kuihs served on your table.The seating arrangement is lovely and you will be amazed at the wide spaces
5
My husband and I were having drinks in the outside area of the Clifford Pier, and when I walked by the restaurant inside I ended up checking out the dinner buffet. It looked great, and for what was on offer the price seemed quite reasonable. I'm so glad we ended up eating there. The service was excellent, and the ambience was really nice. It wasn't too crowded, and the singer and piano gave the area a festive feel. Everything we had was delicious - especially the freshly shucked oysters, sambal shrimp, and chocolate mousse. It was a perfect treat

We were looking forward to have a wonderful tea at the clifford pier restaurant but our experience was far from what we had expected. When we arrived at the restaurant, the hostess was serving 2 ladies. She obviously saw me waiting patiently for her to finish. When she was done with them, instead of serving us, she turned and attended to 4 other gentlemen who were waiting behind me. The saving grace was the gracious gentleman who reminded your hostess that I came before them and she reluctantly attended to me. The Heritage Asian tea was a rip off. The hot items served were cold. The chicken curry wrapped in roti jala was cold and stuck to the paper cone that it was served in. All the other savoury items were also cold. The scones wrapped in the napkin was cold as well and we expected them to be served warm. When we told the staff that the items were cold, guess what the answer was. We will feedback to the Chef. There were no attempts made to exchange the items and obviously the staff thought she could just brush us off . When we asked if our teh tarik can be served without sugar, the answer was no, so we immediately knew it was made from a pre mix.. For the price that we paid for those unappetising morsels, it was daylight robbery. We did not expect that the standard of food and service to be so poor. This will be our first and last visit
4
We came for afternoon tea, by mistake! Meant to be at the old Fullarton hotel! However had an amazing experience. 18 pieces of what looked like traditional English afternoon tea but with an Asian / Singapore twist. Local specialities turned into pastries canapÃ©s , local jams, and flavours. Huge range of wonderful teas and drinks...recommend the rose milk and the apple tea. A good mistake in a lovely setting. Well worth a visit
5
Living as you do in Asia, brunches and long lunches on Sundays become a social occasion. It's hard often to choose a good place, as there is so much choice and also so many pricepoints.With kids, and their active nature, its also important to find a space that allows for a bit of freedom but that is also comfortable.The Sunday Dim Sum experience at Clifford Pier is amazing. Not only with value for money, but also with comfort, allowing adults and kids to enjoy the experience together - and a great price point.Myself and a friend took our 9yr and 3yr old along one Sunday, we enjoyed all manner of asian delights, as well as a dessert buffet for the kids, and the enjoyable dim sum trolleys with all the fav's pork buns, dumplings and of course chickens feet! Ribs in Black Bean Sauce as well - Yum! Also some live "hawker" stations , inc Laksa Hainanese Chicken Rice etcIts well priced at around 50++ and we ordered wine and other drinks onto. Chinese tea is included.. Definitely worth a try on a Sunday
5
Great~ Thank you so much! We had an enjoyable time. Would love to see different main course for dinner.

If you have guests to entertain, this restaurant is a good option. Just off the Raffles Place area, via the OUE overhead bridge, you get a spacious, airy restaurant and decent food.
5
All good. People were friendly. Location is good. Food is nice. Price is reasonable at lunch time. Highly recommend.
5
Reservation respond is fast in terms of clear details stated. Special request is also fulfilled upon arrival.

The Clifford Pier is located in the Fullerton Bay Hotel (one of top 3 hotels in Singapore). It is very classic and beautiful place with live music in the evening. It is a good choice for formal or romantic meeting for the lunch or dinner. The menu is not very long, but has options of European and local cuisine dishes. The buffet is nice. The stuff normally is very accommodating, but frankly the service could be improved, as very often it takes a long time to catch attention of the stuff. If you are looking more towards drinks, snacks and more casual atmosphere, you may consider The Landing Point or The Lantern Bar, which both located in Fullerton Bay Hotel as well.
5
Even though many people might not think of having local hawker fare in a hotel restaurant, Clifford Pier serves really good local dishes. Prices are definitely steeper as compared to hawker centres or food courts but the ambience and service that you receive makes the dining experience well worth it

I enjoyed the Heritage Dim Sum Brunch at the beautiful Clifford Pier Restaurant last month during a brief stopover in Singapore. Now part of the 5 stars, art deco inspired, Fullerton By the Bay Hotel, the space currently occupied by the restaurant was a working pier built in the late 1920s, early 1930s, where goods, visitors and immigrants destined for Singapore used to land.The Heritage Dim Sum Brunch is a buffet that occurs on Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. It serves up a relatively large variety of local fare in comfortable, five stars surroundings. It triggers nostalgia for those who grew up with this kind of food. It also gives an opportunity for visitors to sample local favourites under one roof in very comfortable surroundings. The cost of approximately $50 per head is reasonable. Alcohol can be ordered for an additional cost

After a few reincarnation since it was turned from a bump boat pier to a restaurant, someone finally got it right. It is now one of the most charming dining venue in Singapore. The high ceiling with the arch like structure provides a majestic feel. It resembles one of those grand dinning hall in Europe. The surrounding water view added a serene dimension to the whole ambient. Both food and service was good. Suitable for both casual dinning or business meal
5
We celebrated a birthday High Tea at Clifford Pier with family after a wedding in Australia. The building was designed by Frank Dorrington Ward, an English architect and was the place where goods were brought by boat to Singapore. It has been very well transformed into an airy well constructed eating place with a huge Chrystal chandelier at the entrance. The food was well presented and the service excellent. They catered for gluten free and vegan plates, all nicely presented.
4
It is indeed visionary for the owner of the hotel to take over the venue and turn it into a venue to sample traditional cuisine in an elegant setting with an impressive view of the Marina Bay. Whilst the prices are not for the typical hawker store patrons, the chefs are tasked with preserving the traditional tastes
4
Come for high tea in this "red light harbour". It was converted from jetty to cafe many years and has not tried their service/foods.The place will let you recall the jetty for many cruises to tour the sea front as well as the Kusu Island visit.The saboteurs are just average. Cookies and cakes are good
3
Ambience is really nice as it overlooks the sea. Service has improved since the last time I visited. Food is ok.
5
This is a terrific spot to visit for both tourists and residents alike. Loved the ambience and the staff couldn't have been nicer. A bit pricey, but worth it for a special occasion!
2
Had lunch recently in group of 8 pax and each had set lunch with extra peranakan dishes to share. 2nd visit since opening couple years ago. High ceiling and view of bay are great but food standard not Restaurant level and serving times not in tune with diners starting and finishing dishes at same time. Drinks take at least 15mins to arrive.Wonder if this outlet is part of hotel? If so then Brasserie is preferred albeit east west menu.
4
 The Clifford Pier had been transformed from the early days of an old trading port with immigrants and coolies making their way up and down the Pier steps to the present beautiful spacious dining room that embodies elegance and poy shness.Once inside, it brought us down memory lane .We had a memorable evening with good food and live piano entertainment. The singing duo was lively and commendable. It was not a very crowded night but service was not quite up to mark. Servers were polite but seems a little disorganised. Would still recommend the place as it is a lovely setting with a historical influence.
4
Tried the prata with chicken curry and the beef rendang , both taste outstanding .Ambience was a great experience Only complaint I have though, like most fine dining the portion was too smal
5
We visited with friends for the Sunday buffet with free flow champagne and walked away feeling very satisfied and heavy! The food selection is great and the quality exceptional. The Ruinart was spectacular and the cheese buffet is the best selection in singapore. Save lots of roo
5
We visited the Clifford Pier for a midweek late lunch by chance and found there were plenty of tables without the need to reserve, however I can imagine this is very different at the weekends. The time we visited we visited (2pm) was too late to enjoy the buffet lunch and too early for the afternoon tea - however the Al a Carte menu was very extensive and we were not short of choice.The food seeks to reinvent the traditional favourites of the hawker stalls of south east asia - I admit the heftier price tag to what you would expect on the street was off putting at first but completely dispelled once we dug in! For a restaurant of this calibre on the harbour front in Singapore the price is acceptable if high end.We enjoyed the Pork Baos (which were huge and wholesome - good job we shared) and duck breast for main each, washed down with some cocktails. (SG$150).The staff are extremely attentive and made us feel very welcome, whilst only taking lunch it was difficult to fully appreciate their efforts but I can imagine dinner is made extra special by the team.The setting within the colonial pier (originally the immigration office) has been affectionately restored and makes for a perfect location for that special meal.There are many places along the harbour front for such an occasion but I would definitely recommend Clifford pier
5
Food was excellent, highly recommend the fried chicken entree. Service was great. The staff were attentive without being intrusive and showed real thought for our dining experience. For example, we were provided an additional chair on our arrival for our bags and later in the evening when one of the staff saw us on our phones he asked whether we wanted to use the WiFi.The ambience was amazing. The dining hall is airy, richly furnished with a great view. The tables are nicely spaced apart and there was live music at just the right volume and tempo.
5
High tea at the Fullerton by the Bay is a must do when in Singapore. The decor is plush Neo Colonial. Very Singapore. Live music in the background adds to the refined ambience. The service was excellent as was the food. It is advisable to come hungry as there are so many delicious items to partake of. High Tea starts with a buffet of savoury Asian foods followed by sweets which are served on a tiered plate at your table. $105 Singapore for two. Outstanding value!! One suggestion is a small pot of hot water to top up your tea
5
This restaurant is just beatiful. And old pier converted to very nice restaurant . I was there on a Monday night and there was live music. We sat outside to enjoy the view but inside is equally beautiful. Didn't have a full meal but opted for appetizers and drinks. Everything we are tasted good. Our selection was all Asian dishes.. Eating at hawker stalls is good but if you want to have one nice meal during your stay in a special place, consider going to The Clifford Pier.And lastly, I was with a friend whom I have not seen for years.. Servers noticed the deep conversation we were having. When the restaurant closed, they said we could stay at the deck outside as long as we wanted .. That was very nic
5
Piano music in background , a snack of chicken satay , staff so helpful friendy attention to detail so lovly to see
4
Nice local food, service and excellent environment. very nice view of marina Bay Area, Highly Recommend for tourist ..
5
We stopped in Singapore for a two days and had a walk at Marina Bay. We noticed this lovely place and decided to sit for a drinks. They were closing but they let us sit. Beautiful Stella greet us with her lovely smile which made impression on us. The most beautiful view and amazing service. Big thank you to Bharath and Kui Taah as well. Great job guys and looking forward to see you again

My girlfriend and I had the Local Singaporean Brunch on Saturday. The venue is simply elegant and a sense of relaxation takes over once you are seated. It is a good way to try the local delicacies like Chili crab, satays, laksa, dim sum and then finish off with very local sweets. There is also a pianist who played and was simply excellent - another way to keep that soothing feeling. Also if you want to do free flow then that is also possible, although we decided not to imbibe. A lovely place to take visitors when they come to Singapore to try some local food in a very pleasant atmosphere
5
Spread was not too large but whatever that was put out exceeded all expectations! Delicious local fares and fresh dim sums on carts going around tables.Service was excellent, ambience was perfect. Great way to spend the afternoon, away from the soldering heat outside

We were in Singapore for the weekend and I read about this restaurant from a Singapore tourist booklet, googled it, read the reviews, and we decided to make a reservation for dinner that night, with our daughter, to celebrate our 36th Wedding Anniversary. It is a lovely place! Great atmosphere / ambience and very friendly staff with great service! My daughter mentioned that we were there for our wedding anniversary, and at the end of our meal, we were presented with a small choc mousse cake and choc writing on our place wishing us a happy 36th Wedding Anniversary. We were so surprised and delighted by such thoughtfulness. The Filipino entertainers (male pianist and female songstress) were very good! They sang easy listening songs and songs from Les Miserables (one of our favourites!). Although the restaurant was not busy on a Saturday night, the buffet served was fresh and of decent quality. I wouldn't say it was excellent, but it was good. There were mainly Asian dishes with a rib eye roast, grilled vegies and a salad bar. Oh and rock oysters. We were going to try the local Singaporean dishes on the menu, but after checking out the buffet, found that it had some of those dishes there, and was value for money, when one considers the great service, the ambience of the place and the great singing entertainment. The wait staff were always there to whisk away empty plates, and re-fold our napkins whenever we went to the buffet table for another round. Cayla was very pleasant and has a great attitude in the service line! We enjoyed the satay (chicken, beef and lamb) served with a nice thick peanutty sauce, very good chicken rice, curry chicken and roast pork. The soup kambing was disappointing though, lacking omph and was thickened with corn starch. Desserts were good and we enjoyed the local flavored ice cream - gula melaka and mango! It was an unexpected thoroughly enjoyable evening, great service and entertainment, good food, wonderful ambience. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Singapore (great view too) and look forward to trying the high tea next time when I am in Singapore. Only 1 observation on improvement. We found the seats a bit too low for eating (chest height) so my daughter & I placed the back cushions on the seats to get the right height
4
We decided to try this place since it looks really majestic from the outside. Impressive and stunning I would say. Decided to sit for awhile and order some drinks. We shifted to the alfresco after some time since it was too cold for me. The night view was splendid. With tourists/ people buzzing around, taking photos, it was a joy to be people watching as we sat and enjoy the view. Service was lukewarm. No idea why given the status and prestige this place holds. If staff were profiling their customers and giving different types of service to different profiles, that would be a turn-off. But we didn't let it affect us as the ambience make up for it. A place to enjoy with your loved ones, definitely
5
Was just strolling down from the Merlion Park looking for a place for dinner, came across this beautiful establishment by the bay. First we were just very impressed with the indoor decor of the venue, then we found out it was actually The Clifford Pier Reastaurant at The Fullerton Bay Hotel. We were told they were setting up for the buffet dinner they offer only on the weekend, $58 per person plus service charge and GST. Straight away we booked it.There is a make-your-own salad bar, as well as ready-to-eat gourmet salads on the other side. A good selection of Asian and western style roasted meat, such as roast duck, char-siu, rustic roast beef, pork and vegetables, a whole fish, etc. Seafood bar with prawns, oysters, scallops; also a nice dessert section, tiramisu, creme brulee, nyonya cakes, chocolate almond pudding, etc. Drinks are extra, which is probably the only thing my boyfriend weren't impressed with, SGD$10 for a cabin size pepsi (no coca cola). I liked my kumquat mojito, SGD$16
5
Lovely ambience. Kudos to the manager Gibson for making us feel welcome. Great service! Pastries can be improved though
5
Spent a week in Singapore catching up with friends. I love this city. The Clifford Pier is opulent and traditional, we visited for afternoon tea, Singapore style. Had a great afternoon here, would definitely go back. Great restaurant for drinks, lunch or dinner. 5 stars
4
Pretty unique and surprisingly nice taste for most of the items. Good ambience n service. Recommended!
5
After a couple of years of passing by this historic building I finally found time to bring my wife for an afternoon coffee at this restaurant. The place oozes class with carpeted floors, high ceilings and immaculate furnishings. The panoramic view of Marina Bay was one to behold. It's definitely a great place to bring family or business partners. And, the bill was lower than what I expected of a similar establishment. This is really good value
3
I love the ambience of this restaurant and the views.... Service is average due to shortage of staff.Food is average...
4
An icon for Singapore seaport history, refurbished well and a classic location for high tea. Service was prompt and attentive. High tea savory items were limited but quality was there. Overall, food was great. As a local, this is a gem for a Singaporean taste high tea without the hustle/bustle of most places or didn't hear much screaming children (maybe afternoon naps). The ambience is lovely with the high ceilings
5
Beautiful environment, great variety of local brunch cuisine in historical building with great view. Eat slowly and one type of food at a time. No hurry- bring friends to hang out with and chat. Come not too early as after 11:30 am, yum Cha on carts appears. We arrived at 11 am and were full by the time the extra snacks arrived, and wished we had space in our tummies. Go there it's good ! $ 50 for adults $ 25 for under 11 plus 7% tax plus weekend and public holiday charges. Leave the sushi. Not sure why it's there really.
5
A stunning restaurant with service and food to match. The view is incredible and the openness and natural light of the room makes it even more amazing. We came here for the heritage brunch and the food was fantastic. Great selection of local flagship dishes and a great dim sum trolley. Food and drinks are much better quality and value for money than many other places along the river and the hotel itself is just incredible. I always bring guests here to show them what Singapore has to offer.
3
Well the restaurant has an amazing view and inside the arrangement is also awesome.The balcony on the bank of the river is super cool place to hangout.The food somehow was not as great as it could've been, but maybe my choice was not great.The servers were courteous and helpful.overall it was an experience
4
Visiting Singapore for meetings, I attended a business lunch at Clifford Pier. A lovely atmosphere - and I was able to order "local" Singaporean food, while my Singaporean colleagues could order "western" food. Enjoyed my meal and the views over the water to Marina Bay. Of course you can get much cheaper (and authentic) local food elsewhere, but not in such a lovely setting
3
Food selection was limited, additional 10 dollars for coffee and juices (no indication what juices and got charge 5 dollars more because the waiter gave the selection not on free flow). Food was average and I most likely wouldn't want to return again.

This was a pier built in the 1930s where people can be ferried to the nearby offshore southern islands such as Kusu Island and the sea route has since been destroyed around less than a decade ago by the Marina Bay Sands and Marina Reservoir. Upon stepping into the main hallway, the supposedly Victorian and classy decorations and furnishings are really welcoming. Air conditioning was slightly cold and upon settling down on the sofa seats, the feeling was pure relaxed and cozy. We arrived at about 1130H for the brunch and there is seemingly minimal crowd at that time. We were shown to our seats quickly by efficient staffs who quickly briefed us on the dim sum and drinks selections. I was rather disappointed to know that chinese tea and jasmine tea are the only few complimentary drinks inclusive in the brunch buffet. Juices, soft drinks, coffee will only be available "free flow" with an additional $10+. Beers and wines will be additional $50+ with the selections extremely limited - Tiger and Heineken for beers and somewhere less than 10 selections of wines.On the food, the dim sum selections are limited and the tastes are all mediocre at best. 1. Pohpiah tastes nothing like pohpiah. It should be leaning towards savory-sweet and not sourish. Just get one from coffee shop stalls or Pasar Malams (night markets) and the difference is obvious. 2. Char Kway Teow is cooled. I have to believe it was served warmed. 3. Hainanese chicken and rice was okay mainly because the chilli sauce is good.4. Rojak was ok as well with the sauce well balanced with the full selections of mixing ingredients.5. Satay is cooled. 6. My family loved the chilli crab sauce and fried buns. The sauce's texture, taste and the starchiness are just right. 7. Curry fish was the toughest curry fish meats I had. Its harder to chew than the hainanese chicken.8. The desserts are generally made to petite sizes and the selections are reasonable for a heritage themed brunch. Generally, the brunch provides an idea on the types, tastes of local and heritage food and it will only get better elsewhere from there. The ambiance, relaxed and coziness of the place, accompanied with live singing performance by a pianist, has salvaged the quality of food in this place
5
The right enviroment for lunch and business conversations .
I like the buffet spread which is sufficient for an executive lunch
3
We came here for afternoon tea. First off, Princess, our staff person, was absolutely wonderful. She really did an outstanding job amidst circumstances outside her control and she did so wonderfully. Food - The food had its high and low points; the Singapore chili crab bites were delicious and an interesting take as were the pork belly "sliders" (pork belly wrapped in a Chinese bun. But somethings were off -- why were the scones dry and cold? It's tea service!! Tea - I love afternoon tea having sampled at various places (favorite still remains Claridge's). It's mind boggling that they serve tea from tea bags...really?! I'm not being petty, but if you're selling afternoon tea, shouldn't we at least try for loose leaf tea?This place has great ambiance, but I wouldn't come for the afternoon tea service
4
A day of surprises .... My cousin asked what I would like for a prettyMy Cousin told me she took her dad here just a week ago, she strongly recommended a platter of kong Bak pau, satay etc & truly it was very nice.Next on order was the lobster roll with truffle oil chips. It was good chips n lobster roll was really tasty.We ended the day with a platter of suckling pig. So good that the skin was crunchy, it rocks.We finished the late lunch with two shots Long black. A must return
5
It was a fabulous experience! We ordered 2 sets of Asian lunch set and added the popular lobster roll. Fried carrot cake, chicken curry and laksa was very well executed. The carrot cake was fragrant and had a 'wok hei', the texture of the thick beehoon in the laksa was springy and the ingredients were aplenty.The kambing soup was a letdown, not authentic and we can't appreciate the slight starchy texture. The lobster roll had nice lobster but the roll could be worked on, another let down after all the raves. Overall was an awesome experience because of the awesome service from Evans and Peter! Excellent service always makes a difference!

This is such a beautiful hotel and one would expect much more from a restaurant at the Fullerton Bay hotel.I have been to the Clifford Pier restaurant three times prior and this past week we were a party of three and ordered three mains, we had very high expectations given the location and history of the hotel, however non of the meals were any good (fish&chips, burger, chicken) these are all quite 'easy' to get right relatively speaking... We also felt ill as soon as we returned home as well all had a few bites of each dish. We were forgotten about for most of the sitting and then 2 other waiters came by asking if we wanted dessert (given the quality of food and service we rejected). When the bill came the waitress one who was not serving our table came and coldly said only 'excuse me' and we had to sign and settle quickly. This was not at all appreciated and I was appalled at how little elegance and manners are taught here.On Monday evening, there was a lovely singer in a red dress with a beautiful voice as well as a pianist who were serenading the very few tables on Monday night - both of them were great. However there was a table who kept asking to go on stage as if at Karaoke and sing a song, it was quite sad to see/hear and for the reputation of the hotel it is difficult to understand why the hotel/restaurant would allow this type of thing, so the professional singer had to step down for amateurs...This was my 3rd time at Fullerton Bay and while only the first time was a nice experience mainly due to a kind waiter named Newman, I wanted to give it another chance since our second visit was marred by an arrogant waiter at Lantern who brought us 3 water glasses for 4 people, even after asking if for one more glass since one person did not have water he ignored our request. I think there is a problem with the staffing and management in this establishment, it is worrying and I highly doubt we will be returning
5
Lovely ambience, attentive staff. I had to change our reservation numbers a couple of times, but the staff took it in their stride. The heritage tea was good, though many of the items went cold quite quickly due to the airconditioning. Our party of six were sat at a corner sofa (very comfortable), and lingered for quite a bit longer than we should have after official tea hours ended. I'd recommend this place for a leisurely, lingering, afternoon out.
5
MY wife and I were looking for something different to try. A bit of internet research revealed the Heritage Brunch at the Clifford Pier restaurant.The decor and ambience were very classy but relaxed at the same time (As indicated by the number of families who were dining there)The food consists of a wide range of Singaporean cuisine and some Japanese. There was everything ranging from Laxa (Do it yourself!) to chili crab and lots in between.All of the food was superbly cooked and presented and, best of all, there was plenty of it!The dessert bar was also very unique as it showcased the very best of Singaporean desserts, including such items as Pandan cake. The only concession to Western desserts were the strawberry and vanilla icecreams available (By the way, it was probably the best strawberry ice cream I have eaten anywhere, believe me I have eaten it in a lot of places!)The staff were friendly, highly efficient and very helpful. I cannot praise them enough.If you want to try A great range of Singaporean food in a relaxed but classy environment, then I cannot recommend this place more highly.

After Taylor made her Holy Confirmation we went for a family dinner with her Sponsors to celebrate and also enjoy the wonderful buffet on offer.We started with the fresh Sydney Rock oysters which were fresh and delicious with a nice red vinegar sauce. We tried the various different dishes and enjoyed a bottle or red and the girls had a cocktail.Following the dinner we had a super selection of desertsThe ambiance was really nice the tables are spread out and we had a lady singing in the background.It was a very enjoyable evening.

The thing that first attracted me to this restaurant was the elegant room...French colonial setting on the bay. Eating here did not disappoint, we tried the local dishes...carrot cake, chicken satay and chicken rice. All were divine! and presented beautifully! My only negative would be the service...although the staff are very friendly, they are slow to take your order and inattentive...we ordered a bottle of verve clique to spoil ourselves, not cheap! And had to gesture to the staff to have them refill our glasses. Hopefully that was an isolated day and not indicative of the entire staff

I went there for Anniversary with my baby girl and husband. Service, food and environment all good. Staff is friendly and helpful

Food is excellent and service impeccable. Nice ambience and great way to spend the afternoon. ..........................................................................

I came across this restaurant online and booked a table there based on the menu and location. Photos showed it was gorgeously decorated and we booked this a month in advance. We turned up and outside there are lovely fountains that change colour and are a good photo op. We arrived into the main lobby and was amazed at how beautiful the restaurant was, just as the pictures had promised. A huge chandelier, pianist playing in the background, large vases of fresh flower arrangements, just what we wanted. We were shown to our seats as soon as we arrived and the tables are nicely spaced out so you have privacy. It took 20mins before anyone came and attended to us, and when they did it was merely to ask us what water we wanted. Once the water was ordered and poured it then took a further 10 mins for someone to ask us our drinks order.. whilst we were slightly irritated at the slow service we overlooked it as the restaurant was so nice to look at and we were enjoying the pianist. We ordered our bottle of red, and then about 5 mins later was told this had run out, so we picked the next option which luckily was in. Unfortunately our waiter’s English was not great and so when we asked about the starters and mains (asking for advice on what some of the dishes were as they were local dishes with local names) he couldn’t explain to us what they were, he called another colleague over to try to explain but his English too was not great and so we got a shrug as if to say ‘sorry we can’t really explain’ and then they walked away. So left to depict the menu ourselves we picked our starters and mains. The waiter did tell us that they didn’t have any of the starters that we wanted but that we could have a main instead as a starter option. We thought that this would come up in starter size, but it did not, it was huge and far too filling, so we were forced to eat just half of it and leave the rest. Worst than this, my boyfriends starter came first, mine did not come for 20 mins!!! And so by the time mine came, my boyfriend had already finished his food. What then happened next was even more crazy, so I am half way through my starter and they bring over both the mains. So I now have 2 dishes side by side, when I am not anywhere near ready for the main, barely half way through the starter! My boyfriend asked them to take the mains back as we were not ready for this and so they took them back and left them on the side under a cloche. Of course by the time we were ready for the mains they were cold and so needed to be remade which then added a further delay of 20 or so minutes to recook another plate! We both ordered the steak which was fatty and very average considering the prices. By the end we were so upset with the terrible service, and the fact that the staff had no idea about table service that we were feeling really quite glum and ripped off. The staff did deduct our wine (without us asking, I assume our faces said it all) but we still ended up paying £90 for the meal and it was really unsatisfactory. We were so disappointed by this experience, the restaurant was glamorous and had a great atmosphere but the food and terrible service really let the whole evening down. The air con was also up so high that we were shivering and actually wanted to go outside to warm up! (Never thought I’d say that! I live in London!)Overall, they didn’t have the wine in stock, 3 of the dishes we wanted to order were off the menu as it had run out (not good for a 7:30pm reservation) and the staff were clueless bringing mains and starters at the same time! They really need to look into this because it will lose them a lot of custom. Poor

Love this restaurant, excellent ambience, great view. It feels great to be in a historical building enjoying lovely meal.The food wise, abit pricey. However, not all dishes are nice. It varies time to time
2
A weekend brunch in this venue should be a fabulous experience. However, the air conditioning was chillingly uncomfortable, and fans on high, obviously set for maximum guests and hottest days. Yet requests to waiters were met with rebuff: it's set, management controls it etc. Tables still had congealed food, our table and the one next door, from the breakfast. They up-sold us to free pour without saying it ended at 2pm and we'd had just three drinks each so had barely used half our free pour and asked for more drinks and it felt like a swill as they were clearing lunch for the high tea, which no doubt is cleared similarly for dinner. This is a hotel buffet restaurant with very set rules and underwhelming food. Don't be misled by the beautiful room. Walk through it and find a better buffet somewhere else.

I love the rolls with lobster and french fries. eat outside opposite the Marina Bay Hotel and enjoy the evening flair including the laser show. Price for food is really acceptable compared to other Singapore restaurants
4
Came with friend for the Singapore Heritage Afternoon Tea by Shermay Lee. Loving the ambiance, the decorations. Staff were friendly. We ordered Fullerton Express Tea and Moroccan Mint. We loved it. Our favorite: Kueh Pie Tee, Chilli Crab Mantou (Savourles), Pandan Swiss Roll and Marie Biscuit Cake but Coconut Fruit & Nut Crumble Bar is too sweet for me
5
So we came for Sunday brunch and the place was completely amazing. This space is completely beautiful with the high ceilings and great lights on top. This brings together an elegance that already made us feel relaxed. There was a DJ there with Latin music which gave this entire place a very hip feeling. There were showgirls going around with more feathers on their hair then clothing on their bodies! The food was great too with truffle risotto and egg; wonderful cold seafood; breakfast area; so many types of roast meat etc etc etc. The cheese station and the seafood station deserves special mention. Naturally the price was equally spectacular
4
In Singapore for one night on our wedding anniversary and booked here for dinner. We expected a good view, but there was a function going on so couldn't see much! Service was good and ambience nice. We ordered a main each and a pudding which were both nice, though not amazing as I was expecting . Unfortunately there weren't many vegetarian options on the menu, other than salad which was disappointing.

Lunched here to celebrate a colleague's birthday. The place is really open, with a lot of natural light flooding in, since its surroundings are all full-length glass windows or doors. The ambience is very lovely, with the high ceilings and the chandeliers hanging over us.The Clifford Pier offers local fare in their posh setting, and food-wise, it's a mixture of reviews. I had their kong bak bao for starters, and though delicious, I personally feel that the meat should be a little more fatty. Then again, I guess the restaurant needs to cater to the majority of diners who, unlike me, are generally a little more concerned about their health and/or waistline.The Hainanese Chicken Rice was very good as well, and I appreciate that I got to choose between breast or thigh meat.My friends, who had an assortment of other dishes like char kway teow, bak kut teh, etc. felt that those dishes weren't so fantastic. So I reckon the quality of the dishes aren't all consistent.I took one star off, because service wasn't great, and I expected more from this posh restaurant. It started out fine, but very much like their counterpart in the same hotel, La Brasserie, the speed of their service became a bit of an issue. While they were not quite as slow as La Brasserie, it did take a little longer than expected for our food to be served. On top of it, the utensils provided to us were very often not quite right, for our respective dishes.Do remember that these are local dishes, so it's not all forks and spoons and whatnots.I wouldn't mind coming back solely for the experience of the lovely ambience, but I'll know better to manage my expectations of the food now
4
I've been here at least six times in as many months because my family loves the ambiance. It is a beautiful, airy restaurant. Unfortunately, the menu is limited and the buffet is overpriced for what it offers (compared to other city hotels like Four Seasons). They offer a decent selection of local food which can vary from very good (the satay) to mediocre (the mutton soup and rickshaw noodles). Even then, the satay I had on my last visit was cold. So, it just depends - if you're lucky, the food can be very good, and if not, it is mediocre but never bad. I'm giving it a Very Good rating because I believe the ambience makes up for the food

Right from the moment I stepped into The Clifford Pier Restaurant, I simply loved the ambience - from the high ceiling to the décor. The architecture was astounding and the atmosphere relaxed - something I needed for a restful weekend. I was greeted by Maria who smiled at me and made me feel all so comfortable in an instant. The Singapore Heritage Afternoon Tea by Shermay Lee was a delight – with a refillable tray of Sweets (which we did not manage to refill as one round of the Sweets had filled our tummies to the brim) and a generous buffet spread of Savouries. Love the crowd that Saturday afternoon – filled with families, tourists, couples on dates and girlfriends chuckling over tea and cakes. The space between each table was of a good distance and one can be assured that the conversations stayed within your table. The afternoon tea is worth a try and do book early if you want the Saturday slots. The Chilli Crab Sauce Mantou (bun) was quite to my liking but not the Fish Milk Sauce Choux Bun - it tasted a little strange for me. At the end of the meal, we had a nice pot of tea while we sat back to enjoy the live performance - the singer's voice resonated well with the high ceilings. Thank you Maria and team! I did not manage to get most of your names and I sincerely appreciated your constant attention in ensuring that our plates were cleared and serving us tea. Overall, a great dining experience

Excellent selection of the bufferGood value for money Fresh seafoodAll the meatsGood taste of Singaporean food also internationalVery completely beautiful ambiance and serviceAnd a spectacular view of the sand and the Singapure bayAsia is famous for hotels buffet this is first class
5
Let's be honest. It was the best buffet i ever had, not even the one's at Ritz beat this one. First the place, lovely and fashion and what a view. Second, service 6 stars. And last the food was 7 stars: seafood (oysters from australia so fresh, scallops so good), roast duck, beef so well cooked and sauce lovely. If only i would recomend to improve something would be on deserts as i would expect more, but the ice cream just touched me. Love to come bac
3
The food is a hit and miss, one thing we all liked was the lobster roll. The place is beautiful, has a piano player sometimes which is lovely, and overall it's a good place to visit, but not for the food. The service staff while polite and nice, was severely understaffed so don't expect attention
4
The Clifford Pier is simply elegant, classy ambience and with lovely lighting that adds to its charm. The local dishes were tasty, fresh and adequate serving. Service was polite but perhaps management needs to put more staff on shift. Even though we were seated at the entrance, staff appeared busy at the computer. And we had to call for service.Seating on couches ...hmm, just a little bit too low compared to table height. So I would not recommend seating on the couch. The pipe-in music was a bit loud where we were and it competed with the resident pianist, I would have preferred listening to the pianist. Now the white wine needs to be chilled a bit more. Getting champagne, cocktails, sparkling water and white wine chilled a tad more seemed to be one of the problems dining in a hot and humid Singapore.While we enjoyed our meal, it was expensive .... But then, it is Singapore dining prices.
3
We came because this is a lovely historic building in an interesting position, giving good views across Marina Bay from the outside terrace. Sadly, it appears to have become simply a family dining restaurant for The Fulllerton Bay hotel. The pianist play gamely, the staff were OK but the food was decidedly average and my Hendricks gin martini the worst, by some margin, I have ever had. Water slightly flavoured with gin. I told the serveuse, but she was bemused. She asked me if I would like to complete a comment card. I said no,I would mention it on Tripadvisor instead. She looked confused. She did not offer to take it off the tab. Go for the view, stick to wine or beer and accept the food is pretty average. We were also frozen stiff, wearing long sleeves, so take a jumper or better still a coat
3
I tried the ala Carte laksa. Next time will go for the express lunch set which seemed like a better deal. Hotel price. Good location
5
I visited this restaurant on Saturday for its dim sum brunch.Service was attentive and good. Food were delicious. They have setup many stations around the restaurant, but they also have a dim sum cart that they push around for you to pick out ones you want. Many dim sum restaurants in Hong Kong do not use carts anymore, so it was refreshing to see this.There were a couple of managers walking around the floor greeting and talking to diners. There were a couple of kids who ran around the restaurant, and the senior manager stopped those kid, got down to their eye level, and had firm, but gentle, talk with them. I thought he handled the situation perfectly.Anyway, for the classic and beautiful decor, good service, and good food I would visit this restaurant again when I visit Singapore next time
5
Came for the Sunday buffet and was not disappointed! A culinary hidden gem....no hawker food here! A good choice or either western Or Asian
3
Admittedly, you don't come here solely for the food, especially authentic hawker fare. Having said that, it's pretty decent, and this includes the non-Asian dishes too. You just can't compare apples with oranges; also not fair to compare prices as well - just look at the surroundings you are in.It's hard to imagine how anyone would not be wowed by this restored 1930s beauty; so come here for that. It is also a great place to bring visitors to Singapore.But the service - I'm not sure if this time was a one-off, but it was quite disconcerting right from the start. The lady at the front, Princess, showed us to a table directly in front of the singer and due to a previous visit when we felt that the singing drowned out our conversations, we requested for a table away from the stage. The restaurant was about half filled. She gestured to the table right next to the first, but we asked if we could be placed at the fairly empty front section of the restaurant. She mumbled something to the effect that 'she cannot guarantee that we will be well looked after in that section, whereas, in this section, she and her friends will ensure that we will be.' It took us a second to understand what she was trying to tell us, so we asked her to repeat it. We still however said that we would prefer a quieter table and she reluctantly led us to the front, after which, for the rest of the evening, she ignored us (as a form of punishment??). In this section, the waitstaff all seemed to be very busy even with few tables to attend to. For more than 15 minutes, we waited for the menu to be brought to us and in the end, had to raise our hands for quite a long time (all 4 of us) before we were noticed. Throughout the meal, it was a challenge to find a pair of eyes who would be able to make contact and notice our needs, let alone anticipate. Good waitstaff are able to go about their duties while keeping an eye on all tables (esp hands raised!). But it was not the case here. And the restaurant wasn't even close to full.When we did get service, it was mostly from a very hardworking, earnest and pleasant young guy (Wei Leong??). But all of them need training to be more professional in a restaurant which is so iconic and of this calibre. We were given only 3 glasses on the table for 4 of us and the waiter mysteriously filled only 2! Another case in point, we ordered ice cream for dessert, but all of us were served forks instead of spoons! Trying to get a waiter's attention to have them replaced proved futile (arms getting sore already) and meanwhile, our ice cream was melting!! So my son proceeded to the cabinet drawers to help himself and was met with Princess again who asked what he needed. There were no spoons to be found in that drawer, so she mumbled something like, "I'll go check" and walked away, never to return. Finally, another waiter noticed us, went back to the said cabinet, did not find any spoons still, and proceeded to the next cabinet and got us some spoons. In the end, the ice cream had turned into a drink. It would be a pity that such an iconic and resplendent dining destination is let down by amateur and trainee-style service. Let's hope that this is only temporary

I'm there for the view, not the food really. Food tasted average. Hawker stalls can compete with its local cuisine. One good point is its service and for a nice ambiance, you only need to pay about S$35 for a two course meal
5
Was hosting a group of biz clients for dinner and their have requested for local food. As these were Snr executives, I decided to bring them to Clifford pier. The place was very well designed and very impressive! We were lucky as Tues were buffer dinner and there was singing on stage started at 8pm. The spread was not fantastic but the food was very well presented. Service was very good as well. Truly a place of fine dining with a nostalgia feeling. Btw, the bill don't come cheap, it was about $69++ per head. But with the ambience, good service and music, it's worth it
5
The high tea here is excellent with lots of food choices in the buffet bar - the sambal prawns and pork belly are so tasty. The view towards the sea with Marina Sands, etc at the background is fantastic and the decor superb - very high vaulted ceiling and posh chandeliers
4
On my last day in Singapore a week ago, I caught up with friends and we enjoyed a light lunch at the Fullerton by the Bay Clifford Pier.The building has been converted from the old immigration and cargo pier that used to occupy Singapore Harbour.Now, it is light and airy, part of the Fullerton by the Bay Hotel.The light lunch food is excellent, with fragrant spicy Chinese inspired food predominating on the menu.Excellent with a sparkling water and rich espresso to finish
5
Menu covered a wide choice of food. Continental, Italian, salad and all the specialities of Singaporian cuisine. You can be casual or dress up to enjoy the great setting and the bay.
5
We had the buffet dinner on a Saturday night and the selection was surprisingly good! Almost every dish earned raving reviews from my family. The seafood was fresh, roast duck and chicken rice were delicious, roast beef, satay, wonderful dessert selection.. Everything was great! Coupled with the nice ambience, we had a fantastic experience here. The best thing about tonight was the live music. The pianist and singer were the highlight of our dinner, soothing vocals and excellent song choices. We are already looking forward to the next time we are back here at Clifford Pier restaurant
5
Part of a large party for a business dinner. Had a 7 course menu that had been chosen for us and every one of them was excellent. Fresh seafood, wagyu beef that melted.The building itself has been restored fantastically. Live music that was unobtrusive and well performed. Finished with coconut espuma and a proper coffee.Enjoyed very muc
1
Booked for drinks and dinner outside with business colleagues as great view looking at marina bay sands hotel. However only people outside and pretty poor service. No real prospect of dinner outside and so boring inside we left
5
If there's anything in Singapore that's been restored beautifully, this place is a stunning example. Just over a year old, this place is worth the over-priced food and beverage that they offer. It looks like it should be quite noisy, but with the thick carpeting and luxurious soft furnishing, this place provides just the right amount of privacy of conversation
4
the savoury tier was good. but the sweet tier so so only not really fantastic. service was okay. order drinks but took a long time to serve.
4
Had lunch here and both the lobster roll and wonton noodles were great. The two of us shared the mains. Truffle fries were on point. Lovely ambience. Would recommend this place
5
Had a sumptuous meal of lobster laksa, kong bak bao and Wagyu beef rendang. Great local food in a stylish historic setting along the Clifford Pier. Impeccable service completed this memorable experience.
3
We had high expectations for our dinner at The Clifford Pier, the hotel and location are exceptional. The food was quite good, although the portion size of the lobster roll was quite small. The service was a big miss, very inattentive and took 20 minutes to get our check! Don't see us going back any time soon...
4
The Clifford location offer most probably the best view of the Singapore Marina.The location on itself has a special "flavor".I have been here for a special occasion and, I have to say we have been very positively impressed.Service was very accurate and professional since the reservation.Food was very good, the wagyu beef meat I would say stunning.Definitely recommended, and all considered also very affordable
5
Our visit with The Clifford Pier was on 11 February for dinner. Our server (Newman) went beyond miles and made our day (or evening)! The service was beyond expectations. Apart from product knowledge, we were also informed of the fireworks display. The staff member assist with transition of tables from indoor dinning to outdoor by dessert time, so that we could catch the fireworks. Truly, top notch service! Thanks, Newman
2
My colleague and I were staying at the Fullerton Bay and we had a late dinner with a friend at the Clifford Pier on Thursday night (04.02). We ordered a Lobster Roll, the Hong Kong Wonton Noodle Soup, and the Bak Kut Teh. The lobster roll was fine but the 2 other dishes had no taste. We were very disappointed and could not eat them. Still hungry we decided to order another lobster roll to share.The waitress did not care at all the staff were too busy tiding up for the night
5
This restaurant excels in service, decor, food - a unique Singaporean experience. The have an attention to detail and care about your experience. And - make sure you have reservations (it took three times for us to finally get in) because they have major events that close the restaurant
4
If you have visitors in Singapore, you can bring them here for a taste of local dishes in a very posh ambience. Price is still acceptable for a place like this. We celebrated my daughter's birthday and chose this restaurant because my children get to be hyperactive in a noisy environment. This dining place is just peaceful for us to enjoy our much loved hawker foods in a beautiful setting
4
Staffs were pleasant n quite prompt to assist on any request. They were very sweet to give us a bday surprise without me asking for any complimentary throw in. Am happy with their service. Food wise is normal
5
We were made to feel very welcome in this luxurious place. A beautiful place, very relaxing and comfortable. The food was excellent - the soup wonderful, the salads exceptional, thebeef melted in your mouth and the sweets - to die for. Not a chreap place to eat, but very good value
5
Had a dinner during stay. Food was very tasty & the restaurant was very classy. Absolutely loved the decorations for the christmas eve. Worth trying.
2
Our afternoon tea at Clifford Pier promised so much... and then failed to deliver. The historic room is beautiful but the live singer was way too loud. And monotone. Let him play his piano, which he does well, and quit the singing, far more appropriate for a relaxed afternoon tea. We sat down and the waiter started to take away the place settings. When we asked why he said he thought we were there for drinks only. Why not ask us first. The menu was informative in walking us through the food and tea selection and the TWG teas were good. The food sounded great, a Peranakan-Euro fusion of savoury and sweet treats taken from an old cookbook but, many of the items weren't as fresh as they could be. The bread on the bak kwa jam sandwich was downright stale and hard. We had to ask for extra jam and cream for our scones as the tiny pots were hardly enough for one person let alone the four of us. When we asked for hot water to top up our teapots, a fruit tea was delivered (eventually). We only discovered that after pouring it into our existing teas, which then tasted different. Service was not attentive and we had to wave hands wildly several times. The servers did not know the menu and had to go away to check basic facts, for example, is champagne included in the free flow wine and beers. All in all, disappointing for $49 a head
5
Attended the restaurant for its famous Singaporean "high tea". It's the normal high tea with local delights instead of the traditional European pastries. The savory choices included Kurobuta pork with a steam bun, chilli crab bao! Nyonya chicken curry and roti jala wrap. Also a selection of sweets complimented the savory selection.What can I say, everything was Yum! The price included endless "topping up of both your favorite food and drinks. A wonderful way to spend a couple of hours to relax and talk. A live musician was playing adding to the ambience.Will definitely come back. Only advice is, come early as the kitchen closes at 5.30 so give yourself time to enjoy without rushing. You don't need dinner after this meal
4
Was great food in a great location, but for a business lunch it took way too long to order and get our food.
5
The ambience and setting of the place was amazing. Food was great and there was even live music played by their pianist.

I find it hard to believe that I wrote the first review of Clifford pier on trip advisor! I have been a regular there since. The staff there - Mohan, Prakash are lovely and always make me feel welcome .It's the ideal place to take visitors . The local food selection Iike rickshaw noodles, satay, kong bak pao , chicken rice, char kway teow, laksa and rojak are all great conversation starters. ( I have named them in order of lip - smacking quality ). Don't forget to leave room for the local desserts - they are excellent , everyone of them ! I like the pandan and the teh terik ( milk tea) ice cream .If you fancy something more international , the restaurant offers a salad buffet andDaily roast .Or go for the lobster roll !Coupled with the history of Clifford Pier and the entire Singapore River vicinity +gorgeous interiors - you can see why I keep returning ! But you must make reservations before dropping by - the restaurant may be closed for events at times or fully booked 
5
Located behind the entrance hall of Fullerton Bay hotel. Very spacious and great interior. always good live music for diner. Atmosphere is quite romantic. Menu is short though. Contains some local specialities. Some really nice, some... tastes differ, but everything is fresh and perfectly cooked. Service is fine, but I would say a little lower level than in the hotel. Sometimes you need to search for waiters. Unfortunately kitchen closes at 22.00 so visit needs some planning.As hotel guests we had 15% discount on menu
5
One of the top 10 places to go for high tea in Singapore and it lived up to the reviews. And a lovely building in a great location. We had the 'heritage' afternoon tea which means it's Singaporean not a traditional English or western version. There's plenty of savoury and sweet dishes to try and all can be replenished as much as you want. And there's a long list of teas to go with it. It's a decadent, peaceful and relaxed way to catch up with friends and quality service to go with it
3
This restaurant has a great view overlooking the Marina Bay Sands and its surroundings. At night, you can see spectacular light and laser shows - fantastic view. But do not expect the meals to be as good as the ambiance and the view. It is typical hotel food quality. Moderate your expectation and you will be fine.
4
Good place to introduce out of town guests to local food. Space is nice and open. Yes, it's a bit formal for eating chicken rice and other local specialties and more expensive than going to a hawker, but it's to be expected-- ambiance is infinitely better as are the views! Sometimes you just don't want to sweat during lunch, and Clifford Pier is a good option. I had a nice lunch with an out of town guest, who enjoyed all the food we tried. We did the set lunch and shared 4 dishes between us, which was more than plenty. Chicken rice, char kway teo and carrot cake were all good...I would pass on the bao next time - just didn't care for it
4
This was one of the best restaurants in Singapore in our stay. Nice combination of food from the region and live music during the dinner. Highly recommended! Try the prawn laksa
4
Good ambiance, quiet and good food. Would appreciate if waiting service was more prompt but overall a great experience.
5
A lovely place for an afternoon tea with girlfriends. I visited with my family. The kids were excited. The little one felt absolutely like a princess, amidst the beautiful, cosy, comfortable English style decorations. Food though limited, was delicious. Service was excellent.
A worthy visit!
4
The ambience alone is worth the hype and visit. Savoury food was especially good. Desserts were average.
3
This is a lovely space which has converted the landing point from the original Clifford Pier ferry terminal into a large, bright and air conditioned space now housing the Clifford Pier restaurant. Lots of natural light, tables spaced comfortably apart and just about competent service makes this a handy location for breakfast and lunch for the Raffles Place and MBFC crowd.The prices and portions of the food suggest though that the people running the restaurant think most customers will be able to expense their meals and don't arrive hungry.On a visit 6 months back, the nasi goreng and chicken rice were fine portion and taste wise. The meal I had today was different; in fact shockingly inadequate. Having ordered the two course lunch at $31, the starter portion of rojak was so small, it did not even fill up the dessert sized plate it was served on. As for the chicken curry main course, the curry portion was fine but it was served with what would constitute half a slice of bread if all the thinly sliced pieces of white baguette were put together.My lunch companion's char kuey teow faired better. Portion wise it was ok and it was tasty. The dish did cost $18 though and for that price the restaurant could do better than serve the dish with two prawns (we're not talking the jumbo Ines here) and a few slices of Chinese sausage. If any egg was used in the preparation of the dish (as the menu claims), it was not evident.So come here if you want to have a meet up over coffee only or don't expect to eat very much and are armed with a corporate credit card. I left feeling rather nostalgic for the no frills nasi padang cafe that use to occupy what is now the restroom area to the left of the lobby. It was always packed at lunch and the cost of our meal today would have fed me for a working month
3
This restaurant is located close to the lobby area in this hotel. The room is beautifully designed with great views of the water and Marina Sands Hotel. The menu however did not impress us. There is a small selection of both local as well as western choices, all of which seemed pricey to us. The poor value was confirmed when the dishes arrived. All the portions were small and the flavours were average at best. This meal was most definitely the worst during our 5 day stay in Singapore. Service was fine, just don't sit close to the live band that performs in the evenings - way too loud
4
We came here on the 22nd Dec for a high tea set. The view was fantastic and the service was good. The high tea set (the only item available for high tea) was yummy-licious! The pastry tier was a little too sweet. Overall, the food tasted great! We really enjoyed it!For drinks, you can order as many as you want. So we had coffee, a pot of flora tea and others. Lovely
4
Had our first anniversary dinner at The Clifford Pier. The menu is largely Asian/Singaporean fare, with some American/Western dishes thrown in (burgers, fish and chips etc.). We ordered the grilled prawns for starters - very good, served with an excellent avocado salad. For mains, it was the Hong Kong Wanton soup and the ribs in oriental marinade. Excellent portions, though I felt the ribs were a tad overcooked. I really had to saw away at the meat, and it didn't quite just fall off the bone as one would expect.We were seated inside for dinner, and then made our way outdoors for a quick drink facing the pier. Knowing that it was our anniversary, they even brought out a really nice slice of dessert. Not sure what it was, but it was absolutely brilliant. We were on a sugar high for a few hours after having it!All in all, a great experience - wonderful food, not overpriced despite being the Fullerton, and excellent service. Look forward to heading back soon
4
From the moment we checked in till we leave, i am very satisfied with the service, food and overall experience. However, a black jacket Chinese man wearing spectacles is not that smiley and i believe he is too stressful by providing service that he loss his smile.

A must do if you are in Singapore. The place is fabulous, it has been so nicely decorated. There was a big choice of savoury and sweet cakes. Hibiscus and pineapple jams were delicious. If I could fault something, it would be to bring the scones at s much later stage so they don't get so cold. Highly recommended
5
A converted pier that is cavernous with row story high ceilings and glass walls that provide lots of natural sunlight and views of the bay. Terrific choice of local and Western cuisine. Has outdoor deck seating area that is great for evenings. Highly recommend it.

The foods were fantastic however the service was a disappointment. This is my second time visiting and the services were below my expectation.
4
The local specialities are worth trying here. The service was very good and attentive. The only minor point was that there was only one desert wine (a moscato).
5
Best summed up as you surely won't go away hungry! You can get free refills of the food, though I'm not sure you will need that. The chef creates some simply amazing savory dishes combining traditional British high tea items with the culinary experiences of the local region. The service was also amazing, and the venue itself is a treat on the eyes, combining a great view of the waterfront with the historical significance of the venue itself.I would definitely go back again. Helpful hit - don't plan to have major dinner plans as you likely won't be hungry at all

Food was average and the portions were a little small for the price tagged. I guess we are paying for the ambiance and service. We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday (and so were 3 other groups of customers) and they were more than happy to help us out with it! :) Kudos to the pianist-singer who entertained us very well with his great piano skills and professional singing

Had dinner with a journalist friend there and we enjoyed very much! Good atmosphere and service, food is not bad too! I ordered lobster bun, very nice! I like the pianist and songs! One tips, they don't serve water... so when me and my friend order a sparkling water and distilled water, is about S$20

Jaw droppingly beautiful. It was a privilege just sitting in this restaurant taking in the architecture, style, view and glamour. Sunday dim sum brunch buffet is wonderful and great value for money. The laksa, dumplings, sambal prawns...mmmm, so delicious. This was my favourite part of a jam-packed weekend in beautiful Singapore.

We visited Singapore in October 2015 and whilst walking around this wonderful city we stumbled across the Clifford pier restaurant,it was a cool haven from the heat and humidity.My wife and I opted for a traditional afternoon tea in this quaint calm environment,the ambiance was great piano playing in the back ground ,efficient staff lovely food I a colonial style setting. Not cheap but worth every penn

Replenishable 3 tier goodness - local meat delights, crab sandwiches, macaroons, TWG tea, a mixture of cakes, popiah and local delights. For the first round, have a bit of everything. I ordered the kong bak pao several times - this is the local version of pork belly with steamed bun. Very succulent and soft. Well-cooked and fragrant.
4
The Clifford Pier has a lot going for it; it not only has an impressive location, but boasts a great and varied menu, delicious food and the service from staff is very professional. A fine dining experience in every way. The lobster roll is a delicious dish and manages to combine the informal with the formal nicely. My only bug bears were the amount of lobster in the lobster salad starter (very little). Apart from that - very nicely don
4
Ambience of the place is extremely good. The live performance was good as well. A little disappointment is on the food. The calamari was too salty.
4
Attended a stand up business event at Clifford pier. The venue is a beautiful space catering for a large crowd. Room has a colonial British feel with very large glass windows looking out to marina bay sands. Restaurant is attached to the Fullerton Bay Hotel.
5
the food was really fantastic and the live music created a nice atmosphere. totally recommend this place.
5
The reservation was easy.. We had an enjoyable birthday dinner with my family and I will use this app again for booking.
5
A great selection of food. Various modern takes on typical Asian cuisine.
Reasonably priced food and great quality.
Service was friendly and relaxed.
Beautiful restaurant and view!
Will come again!!!

Place was nice and spacious,staffs are very attentive and address to your needs immediately.food is nice!
4
Nice ambience. I visited the place repeatedly for both lunch and dinner. They offer set lunch and buffer lunch options at S$30++. In the evening, they even have live singing performances.
5
Fantastic authentic Singapore food in a stunning setting, the old Clifford Pier building which is air conditioned to perfection. The food here is as authentic as at the Hoka centre but served with style and a smile. The lobster with yellow noodles were amazing and have to be tried.

The place looked really nice, but the service of staff could have been better. It was a dim sum buffet, but there was only one dim sum trolley for so many tables. It should have been obvious to the management that customers were going to be unhappy. There were quite a few unhappy customers, myself included. The popular selections were always taken by the time it reached the last few tables. In fact, in a two hour brunch, I had to wait 45 mins before I got the popular ones. The staff were friendly at first, but I think that by telling your diners that the trolley is on the way for 45 mins reflects badly on the management. Somethings needs to be seriously done if they would want people to revisit this place again. It is really a pity that the place is so nice and pretty, but the service standard is of such a huge disparity. Would really ask potential diners to think twice before going down to this place as I was too attracted by the set up of the place initially.

My friend and I decided to try out the Dim Sum lunch buffet, available on weekends and public holidays, on Hari Raya Haji last week. We were expecting a big crowd but were pleasantly surprised to find a decent but quiet group of patrons at the restaurant. This was a welcome change from the usual hustle and bustle of lunch-hour in Singapore. The restaurant itself is the remodelled Clifford Pier, an actual functioning pier that used to offer speed and junk boat rides till not too long ago. The renovation of this historical place has been done very well with the structure of the pier, especially the arches and the high ceiling, retained though it is now a much fancier space. Being a dim sum lunch buffet, there was a good variety of steamed dim sum that was served via a “dim sum trolley” pushed by a pleasant “dim sum auntie”. We could choose the type of dim sum we wanted and help ourselves to as many refills as we wanted. All the dim sums were yum but the char siew bun in particular was delicious. The selection of fried dim sum was neither as extensive nor as impressive. Other than the dim sum selection, we could help ourselves to the very wide array of local food delicacies including all the favourites such as chilli crab with mantao, laksa, chicken rice, Chinese rojak, popiah and many many more! The dessert selection was great with different types of local delights including Teh Tarik or Pandan ice cream and all sorts of kueh. The buffet deal comes with free flow of Chinese tea and you can upgrade to include either free flow of soft drinks or champagne. We stuck to the Chinese tea so we could maximise our tummy space for all the yummy food. Needless to say we were really stuffed by the end of it all.Overall I would recommend the buffet if you want to enjoy a decadent Singaporean meal in a fancy place without breaking the bank. We paid around $57 per person for the buffet which is pricey for the “local food” but absolutely reasonable for the experience. Oh and make sure you are in the mood for a leisurely meal as you need sufficient time to do justice to the extensive buffet spread
5
Such a grand dining room, super high ceilings and plush dining setting. Service to match with very nice food. I really enjoyed the singer and piano player which added a touch of charm. It felt like I was transported to a magical place.
5
Great local food for business lunch in a lovely setting. But too pricey though; ridiculous pricing for coffee and tea. I would come back if there are special deals.
4
We brought a foreign guest and she was blown away at the space, design and ambience of the place. She also liked the bak kut teh and the laksa cod dish. Desserts were memorable especially thir take on the lemon meringue pie.The colonial branding works especially the historical subtext in the menu which is a useful talking point for guests. As for the live singing - perhaps a light jazz quartet would be more suitable for dinner. The place closes at 10 pm sadly as some guests would like to linger on for after dinner drinks. Perhaps a smaller space can be dedicated for this as there is plenty of room still at the foyer

The refurbished restaurant gives anyone walking in a 'wow' moment because the decor is impressive and the waters surrounding it immediately slows you down a few beats. You will wish to have a lazy afternoon sipping tea and eating snacks while watching the activities on the water and snapping photos of the marina bay skyline. But once the food is served, the whole 'wow' experience is turned upside down. For locals who have tasted the best of our hawker fare in every nook and cranny of Singapore, the food here is definitely given the thumbs down. Whether it is satay, hainanese chicken rice or Hokkien noodles, none of them will score at least a passing mark. The only saving grace was the Teh-Tarik ice-cream which is not typical hawker fare. If you really do not wish to brave the heat and the less hygienic environment of an authentic hawker centre, a better choice will be the Straits Kitchen at Grand Hyatt. The satay there is so good it has a constant queue. The muah chee dessert is better than those you find at fun fairs and pasar malams. For tourists wanting to sample authentic Singapore hawker food, you can skip this place because it gives you a false impression of the standard of hawker food here.To add to the miserable food, service was extremely slow. We spent almost two hours on a 3-course set lunch
4
Evening dinner here and asked to sit outside. Stunning views to marina bay sands and of the light show. Menu is a little limited and some odd dishes but have to say the ones we chose were excellent . Wine was good too. Service was unrushed and helpful. So for an evening out soaking up the marina bay atmosphere if you get an outside table you really can't go far wrong with this restaurant . Recommend

Been here a couple of times. Selected food from their ala carte menu and was not disappointed. Their prices are definitely on the high side but I guess you are paying more for the ambience than the food. I've had different experiences with the service staff with some being extremely slow with our order and at other times it was pretty decent. If there's anything I like most about this place is that it's a lovely escape from the madness of Raffles Place during lunch time and holds nostalgic memories of days past. Their Nasi Goreng and Chicken Satay are my faves. Dessert wise, their Profiteroles, Banana Fritters, Carrot Cake and the Hong Kong Dai Pai Dong French Toast (extremely sinful) are great! Good cappuccino
3
The location was lovely. The food was satisfying but nothing wow. The prices were average but probably not worth the quality. We ordered the nasi gorang which wasn't the best and the rice a little too spicey. I actually thought the rice may have been cooked a long time before it was served because of the texture. The satay skewers were tough and didn't have the best flavour and the fried drumstick again dry. The prawn wonton soup was ok. Have had better and nothing wow about it. Would go again but would probably order something different
4
I was struggling with the rating because we had gone there for a dimsum brunch over the weekend, and actually everything except the dimsum was good. Food variety was moderate, but what we ate we enjoyed. Staff was pleasant ... although the dumsum trolly didnt come around until 30 minutes after we started eating. Dessert also left a lot to be desired.Go, but dont expect amazing dimsum ... enjoy the rest
5
We had an overseas visitor and decided to have afternoon tea at a special venue. I remember Clifford Pier as a pier when I was a kid, so this was a perfect venue for my parents and I. The hotel was such a gorgeous restoration of Singapore's past. Afternoon tea at SGD45 before taxes was delicious. The chili crab mantou and kurobota pork bun were local delicacies made differently. Must try the Teh Tarik, it was aromatic and flavourful. We didn't manage to finish all the food, so come with a hungry stomach as the items can be replenished. Special shout out to the staff, I remember Alice and Newman! Very attentive and always smiley. Newman is a perfect model of Singaporean hospitality, I hope he wins the Singapore Experience award again.
4
I'm usually a bit wary of hotel restaurants as they can be lazy and overpriced, but Clifford Pier is different. The food we had was good (though my laksa used pasta instead of noodles which seemed crazy), the surroundings are gorgeous and the staff were absolutely lovely, telling us about the history of the pier and the hotel
5
The combination of food, ambiance, wine list, service (ask to be seated in Newman's section) and location (right on the Singaporean waterfront) are unbeatable.
5
This offers lovely view of MBS and live music. Probably good date restaurant. Kids should not be brought to as it breaks the ambiance.
3
Amazing venue - designers did an amazing job. Could stare at it for hours. Service was poor - had to ask for attention over and over, dishes delayed and some flavors not great. Chef needs some more feedback. Also A/c on too strong and it was cold. would try again for the setting if they dont do better, too bad.
4
My husband thought this place deserved a 4/5. I guess its more of the very quiet ambience, lovely live piano and singing and the view of Marina Bay. We went for the high tea, the tiers were refillable but the selection was too much for us, we didn't order a refill. I didn't find the food exceptionally appetising, after a few puffs and pancake and I was feeling rather full.We were curious about this celebrity chef as reports claim she had her roots with homely nyonya matriachs, hence, very local flavour and ideas. pretty good I guess, but not exceptional for a high tea. My husband and I loved trying out new places for high tea, hence maybe my expectations were set pretty high.The high tea offered bandung, tea tarik and some coffee and tea choices. They have a more extensive tea selection - with additional cost.Do drop by if you've never sat here before
3
My reservation for Dim Sum Brunch was not logged into the system, perhaps due to a change i made. They gave us a table still, but took about 5-7mins before they served tea to me only, while my family who was getting food wasnt served till later on. Seem kinda understaffed or else inappropriate instructions on who to take care of which area.Breaking down the food:Mains - quite goodDesserts - most of them full of flour taste except for Wa Ku Kueh, Young Coconut Jelly and Ondeh OndehDim Sum - push cart basis, took about 30mins after being seated before the first cart came out and ran out of certain dish before it came to our table. Low frequency of carts coming out, only had Har Gow after te 4th time it was out and about 1.5hr into the meal.Service got better after about 1hr, there are jasmine tea and water served since I did not pay for drinks
4
The title really says it all. If you want a relaxing, chill out from the bustle of Singapore - this would be one of my choices. Even better you can walk from the Entrance to the Fullerton Hotel virtually all the way here under cover (It was torrential rain when we went for lunch). Had specifically visited to make a face to face booking, only to find NO Booking. However a table was found for us. We chose from the A la carte, which has a good selection of chinese dishes - nicely presented and very tasty. They do a buffet Lunch - which looked Ok but totally western. Plenty of staff "rushing around looking busy" but actually quite hard to get anyone to actually serve but what is served is good. Mains around $24 Wine around $16. A stroll back along the waterfront, though Fullerton to the Asian Civilisations Museum (one of singapore's secret highlights) rounded of a good relaxing lunch and afternoo

One of the best restaurant providing local dishes in Singapore ! Magnificent view of the skyline, awesome interior best serenade music. Thank you for arranging the night for us, debie hope we got your name right! The team performed very well! Warm welcome and great assistance ! Will be back again!
5
The ambience of the restaurant is a big as you could see the full view of MBS integrated resort from here. The food spread for the buffet was excellent, there are sushi and soba, Chinese dim sum, peranakan cake selection, laksa, satay, ice cream and local food such as hainanese chicken rice, fried carrot cake, and many more. Look at my photos posted and you would want to miss this place
3
We tried the specials and were looking forward to some very special and tasty dishes, but the service was mediocre and so was the food. The setting is beautiful and live music is definitely a plus. But the overall experience was not what we had expected of such a name. Still, the setting and interior is pretty amazing, one should go there and maybe at least try the afternoon tea, which we haven't tried yet but looked great.
4
Managed to sneak in a quick lunch in this fabulous restaurant on a work trip to Singapore. The rojak was excellent, the fried carrot cake was so flavoursome, the Hainanese chicken was succulent and the broth just perfect. Ah.. drooling just thinking about them..Anyway, go!!! The delicious food is second only to the history setting you'll be in.
2
The restaurant itself in terms of location and ambience is fantastic.As is the food; when you actually get it.And there is my problem. My wife and I had afternoon tea at Clifford Pier yesterday and the experience was marred by lacklustre service and attention.With one of us vegetarian we received a separate tray each. However my wife's arrived a full 25 minutes after my own - the contents of which were cold by the time we could both eat.Multiple requests for fresh coffee and tea each went a full 15 minutes before being fulfilled.So yes the restaurant looks good, but with a seemingly total lack of respect for your custom the general feeling you are left with is that "yeah we'll take your money but not you really aren't that important".And to be blunt no one needs to feel like that regardless. It comes off as arrogant and complacent
5
For someone who may want to showcase our local fare with good ambience and historical value, Clifford Pier would be a 'must' visit. The set lunch offering is good value for money. Selection from the buffet is extensive which include pasta and soup. For an additional $8+++ you can try the daily roast as well.
5
My parents and I were looking for a place to chill and chanced upon The Clifford Pier for its panoramic view. We were greeted with smiles and proceed with ordering some snacks and a few drinks. About an hour later, we decided to settle for dinner. We ordered the roasted chicken and the cod fish. The cod was one of the finest I ever had. The meat was succulent and skin were cooked to a perfect crisp. It was the taste of heaven.Overall, we were really impressed with the level of professionalism and service they provide
5
We had the most pleasant experience at the Fullerton Bay Hotel, Clifford Pier High Tea.The local coffee, Kopi Kosong is a great drink to start with. The Kurobuta Pork bun and chill crab mantou are delicious!Dining at Clifford Pier is a most nostalgic experience and the local high tea variety fits the place. Really good quality food. Go try
3
Food was normal, nothing special.1)Service staff was blur, drinks were double served twice.2)When my husband ordered his 2nd drink for a pot of tea, tea cup not given. When asked for a tea cup, there was traces of lipstick stain on it. Had to asked for a new one.3) When asked for last order to refill our food, after 15min food is still not served. When bill is presented to us food is still not served, we can't be bothered to ask. Make payment and left after a short while.For Fullerton, standard like this is not acceptable. Disappointing
4
The restaurant is beautifully located in the old Clifford Pier. This place will surely give you a good dose of nostalgia for those who have been here to catch a ferry.....quite some time ago. The restaurant is open and the deco is tastefully done. The roof and handling lighting is a real visual draw. Food: Decent....high end and expensive local fare.....Service: Good....place was empty when I dined there.Value for Money: Well....average.Overall: Worth a visit...

I went to have dinner at the restaurant and was promptly seated. I sat there for 20 minutes without a single person approaching the table. I had to flag down a waiter to ask what I needed to get something to eat and drink. The restaurant wasn't busy and the better part of the meal, the staff stood off to the side talking. The food was delivered and nobody bothered to check back with me. At the end of the meal the waiter asked me if I wanted to speak to a manager. I asked the waiter if that was the manager standing off to the side and he responded it was. I responded that the manager had stood there watching the entire meal, I didn't think it was going to do any good to talk to him if he had been standing there watching the entire time. The food was disappointing leading me to believe that the only reason to eat in the restaurant was for the view. It is the most beautifully decorated restaurant in a great location, unfortunately, it was the worst dining experience I had in Singapore
5
My friend took me to The Clifford Pier restaurant at Fullerton Bay Hotel and the place literally took my breath away.Serving meals plus afternoon tea, she promised that it would be worth the price.We arrived a little too early for Afternoon Tea (which starts at 2.30pm) so we decided to order from the Lunch menu.We shared their famous Kong Bak Pau, which is a Chinese specialty of soy-braised pork belly served on a steamed bun, Lobster Roll and a cold glass-noodle with Sea Urchin. All the dishes were superb and we thoroughly enjoyed the meal.Prices are not cheap though, but it's worth the splurge. Will definitely be coming back here again

It's hardly surprising this restaurant is often closed for private functions, especially weddings. It's a magical-looking place with a world-class view across to Marina Bay Sands.On one of the piers jutting out from what was once a major immigration post for Singapore and part of the Fullerton Bay Hotel complex, the space has been beautifully restored and decorated. During the day it's the place for a power lunch, featuring a wide range of Asian classics that have been executed with a high level of finesse, as well as a couple of western touches - an excellent lobster roll for example. Our highlights were some perfect pork belly buns and an incredibly well-balanced laksa. The service is efficient and friendly and unobtrusive. It's a real touch of old world glamour
5
Fantastic pasta and great fish and lobster dishes. The food is real tasty and the service is first class. On the roof you find a nice bar - great place to escape the heat and you can enjoy the beautiful views while having a cool drink and a few tasty snacks.
5
This restaurant was refurbished from an actual working Pier, and they couldn't have done a better job. It was lovely sitting at the comfy seats and enjoying the scrumptious food. Somewhat overpriced but yummy.
4
Enjoyed the ambience to this amazing transformed boat pier. I am thankful they kept the exterior intact while the interior has brightened up. When I was younger, this is a place where people are seen with bags getting to ready to board their boats. And those who returned to shore. It was a sweet nostalgia for me and family. The view from where we were seated was awesome. We faced the Marina Bay Sands and the river. The food and services was great. Love the fusion rendition to English Hi-tea to a localized, filled with authentic local flavors. You got to try if you have not as yet

Converting one of Singapore's landmarks by the Pier which used to be part of Singapore's Sea Hub, this Restaurant now makes a grand and relaxing place for relaxed Afternoon Tea Dining. Great acoustics too with random 3-piece Band, solo pianist or just great playlist of appropriate music.Afternoon Tea served on a 3-tier tray and good selection of drinks: coffee and tea. Be careful as the Marketing Team schemingly designed the key points to be in microscopic fonts which I find a real distateful move for all the great the Restaurant offered. Not all drinks formed part of the buffet, doesn't help when Service Staff doesn't even bother to go through the Drinks Menu and the prices one have to pay for those off-buffet list.Tourists who want a nice ambience, wonderful location, rich culture rich venue and not forgetting great food, also want to mention 2 speciality items which are served by service staff fresh off the kitchen: Chilly Crab on Fried Bun and Kong Bak Bao(layers of pork belly stewed in dark sauce over a steamed bun).Price: doesn't come cheap but for the overall dining experience, I find it value for money
4
Clifford Pier is located at the back of main lobby of Fullerton Bay Hotel. For lunch you can enjoy 2-3 set lunch from 30S$ to local food dish for 20S$. You are facing Marina Bay Sands right across the water and the venue has full of natural lights. They do offer buffett lunch which suits group business lunch.
5
We booked a table to celebrate my Mums birthday, food was fantastic highly recommend the lamb chops and lobster. Drinks were reasonably priced for Singapore. Staff were very friendly and courteous, the singer even sang Happy Birthday when the cake arrived. Will definitely eat here again. The rest aren't itself is lovely, comfy chair
4
We were there for the Father's Day Afternoon Tea. The ambient was relaxing, great and right. It was beautifully decorated, a pianist was playing at the grand piano, sofa seat was very comfortable. Listening to the live piano pieces and chatting away with your companions. The Clifford Pier was definitely a good place for afternoon tea enjoyment. The afternoon tea was priced at $49++ ($57.33 after tax & service charge) per adult and $25++ per child. On usual day, it will cost $45++. The foods and beverages are refillable. I personally think that the savoury items tasted better than the sweet stuffs, especially the Chili Crab Mantou and Braised pork bun. Scones were great with the different jams of your choice. However, the other items tasted really average and maybe below par as compared to our local eating places of coffee shop or hawker center. The portion of foods served were considered big. We did not manage to finish some of the cakes and cookies from our only 1st serving, although we came weith empty stomach. The staffs were attentive, friendly and obliging. There was this Mr Newman who was really observant and attentive to our needs. Overall, thumb up for all the serving staffs on duty on 21 Jun 2015. Conclusion: Worth to pay for the enjoyment of the ambience and nice decoration as well as the service. However, not so much on the foods. I would rate it as Good, between average and very good
3
The interior of the place was beautiful - classy, historical and relaxed. They did a great job maintaining the structure of the Pier. Ambience is one of the best among the other hotels in Singapore. The high backed sofa chairs were plush and very comfortable.Dim sum brunch buffet was priced at 48+++ which is quite reasonable for hotels. However I do not recall pricier ingredients used the fare was local and dim sum.The local food was good. Special highlights were the rickshaw noodles and the carrot cake. The popiah (the turnip) and rojak was disappointing.The dimsum though was a joke. Despite being a "dimsum brunch", the solitary dim sum cart would wheel out once every 10-15 mins and the items on the list were very limited. In the first round, only 2-3 types of dimsum dishes were available, and the second time it came by, it had another 2-3 items.Since i viewed the menu online (http://www.fullertonbayhotel.com/~/media/fbh/menus/the-clifford-pier-heritage-dim-sum-brunch.ashx), I asked them if the other items are available. The staff looked puzzled and said the menu I was showing was not their restaurants. I showed the name tagged on the menu again. Her manager quickly came in and helped to get some other available dishes such as the fried beancurd prawn roll. Some items I wanted to try such as the Steamed Custard Bun, Baked Fresh Milk BunDeep-fried Yam Dumpling were not avaialble.In short, dim sum was far and few and between. The dim sum menu already is VERY limited and several items were not available. Its quite silly that there was only ONE cart coming out in such long intervals if it is a dim sum buffet.The dim sum was also unfortunately not very good - not expected from a good-classed hotel. I can get the likes and better at Crystal Jade/Paradise Group chains.It was still a lovely experience at the location - ambience, and local food. I think they should stop this dim sum thing. If they market this brunch as a dim sum one, it flunks
5
We loved the food, specially the local food. The view and the ambiance are also wonderful. While we were there they had a really good singer and pianist. We really enjoyed this restaurant, went twice during our stay in Singapore and will return for sure next time we are there.

Dined here for lunch on a Sunday from a recommendation from our hotel. On Weekends, it is a buffet style with a nice mixture of local food. In addition, there are food stations with chefs on hand and also yum cha trolleys with great dumplings, etc. The location itself is amazing, you get perfect views over the bay and of Marina bay sands. The inside of the restaurant is equally stunning (see photos by other reviewers). They also had a 3 piece jazz band playing which lifted the the experience to another level. The food and service were both excellent. The food was a nice mixture, I did manage to try most items and given the price you pay per head, I thought it was very reasonably priced. Service was friendly and attentive. Overall we had an amazing experience, one of the highlights of our holiday. Great food, excellent service and amazing setting to enjoy lunch with friends and family. We are already looking forward to going back on our next visit to Singapore

This is the restaurant you go for ambiance, to impress your guests, to have your first date, or to rekindle old flames with your loved one. The food is average with some hit and miss. We had the Burata cheese for starter, that was great. My wife had lobster roll, which was a miss - the lobster did not taste fresh. I had the local rickshaw noodle, which was average. Given that it is located in a posh 5 star hotel, the bill was reasonable. So moderate your expectation about the food there before you go, but the ambiance will compensate that.
5
We had a gorgeous lunch in this beautiful space. The food was fine, the atmosphere divine and the service staff were friendly and welcomeing (which I wasn't expecting based on previous reviews). Looks like service issues have been ironed out. Well done Suryaprakash! Highly recommended!
3
Drinks were good. Food was fine but there were so little options as it could be better. They serve local food. Avoid tables outside the restaurant as it contains lots of ants- maybe from the small plant pot.
Staff was attentive.
4
The ambience was really nice and romantic. However, I think $45+ is a bit to steep for what were served. One of the wait staff was very clinical in his service - ie cold. Overall, service can be warmer. We asked for a serving tong but was told to use our hands as it is local food. We are more concerned about food hygiene. The tong never came. We are planning to go back to try the dinner menu in 2 weeks' time. Hopefully, the service experience will be better and we will get value for what we will paying for.
1
We were 5 mins early, approached the counter, told us to wait till 3.30pm, then we waited, they served other people and had then seated, we were still waiting, we went to ask her about our seating, she told us to wait again, we got stood up for more then 15 mins. The counter lady kept forgetting our name?! And our reservations. Not too happy with that. Then we finally got our seats, no one came forward to take our orders, before we could ask questions, waiter told us to wait n walked away, he came back only 5 mins later and asked what would we like. Bad service experience.
4
We left the Lantern on the rooftop of the Fullerton Bay Hotel at 10.30 to realise that most restaurants had stopped serving. We ended up at the Clifford Pier where the staff offered us to take advantage of the buffet for 30 mn. The food was very good, service was perfect. The table and chairs are really well set and comfortable.

We chanced upon the beautiful & majestic looking Clifford Pier restaurant on Saturday 9th May at 9.00pm after our dinner at the Customs House next door. Attracted to the beautiful setting, my guest of 4 and I walked towards the host requesting to see the menu. Without even a word or any greeting, she handed over the menu to us in such a perfunctory manner, we were shocked by the actions of Miss Noellene. After going through the menu with my guest, we returned the menu back & thank her but once again there was total silence & with no response or request for any reservations. My guests & I was absolutely shocked for it is such a pity that such a beautiful restaurant would receive guest in such an appalling manner
4
We had a lovely dinner with good service at this restaurant. We started with delicious cocktails and chose Asian food. Service was attentive. During the evening there was a duo of a singer and a pianist performing, which we enjoyed. Later on we had coffee in the outside bar and watched the laser show which was a first for us and we enjoyed it. A wonderful way to end a great evening.
4
We had dinner here on the first night of a 3-night stay in Singapore. The location on the marina is lovely, and the interior of the restaurant is a large, historic, and beautifully refurbished space. The food and service were fine. If anything, we thought the ambience was lacking - it was a Thursday night and most of the tables were empty - and the emptiness and quiet was all the more obvious because it is such a large open space. After dinner we had drinks on the roof of the hotel at Lantern. The views were great, and the service was excellent. We were shocked by the drink prices, but we eventually learned that this was standard for Singapore, at least in touristy bars

Service was great and staff were attentive. The ambience was excellent - background pianist and very nice surrounding views with lots of photo taking spots. The food choices were poor. We left behind half of it. Our suggestion is keep the scones, otak sandwich, pandan roll, crab buns and replace the rest with cucumber and egg sandwiches, mini curry puffs, Ã©clairs, parma ham on crackers, mini bruschetta. The biscuits can be a nice touch if served together with coffee or tea.

After taking in the sights around the Marina Bay, enjoy a lovely relaxing dining experience at the Clifford Pier Restaurant. Ask to be seated at the side near the back facing the bay where you can have a good view of the Fullerton Hotel (which looks grand when lit up at night) and the bay as the day sets. Yes I would encourage arriving just before sunset. The setting in the restaurant is spacious and grand. Together with the lighting, it has a nice atmosphere of unimposing grandeur. The menu is a mix of local and western. We had the Heritage Bites, a mixed platter appetizer of satay, kueh pie tee and kong bak pao. Not the best of each that can be found elsewhere in Singapore but collectively pleasant. For mains, we had the Ocean Trout and Pier Beef Burger. Not the best we've ever had but not bad. Had a glass of Pinot and my partner a cocktail. While we dined a 3 piece band played some Jazz numbers that infused well into the ambience. The servers were polite and their service prompt. However at times I felt a bit imposed upon when several servers would take turns to regularly check at our table. But they were all friendly. Perhaps they could be a little more discreet. We were pleasantly surprised to be served by Mr Newman, the Singapore Tourism Board's Singapore Experience Award 2014 winner for Best Customer Service, Food & Beverage. We had a wonderful chat. Perhaps the restaurant can strive to achieve the best experience award. I would say it's on its way. Bottomline: worth dining there to complete your experience around the bay area

The ambiance was fantastic.lovely and cozy environment to have a date.Enjoyed as we dine with the live band playing.Love the lobster roll and the Trishaw noodle.service was great too.
2
Go ahead if you have that extra cash for great ambience but average and/or below average local food. I rather u explore local hawker centres for authentic local food.

Beautiful setting, great makan. Wish we had gone outside earlier to finish our drinks...amazing view of marina bay area.

We were prepared for a classy dinner. But the first impression has NOT been good. And this bad service went on from reception counter to the table to when we left...Waited at the counter to the restaurant but the lady was more interested to talk over the phone than to serve me. And then a Caucasian couple came waiting behind us but the lady just kept us waiting while she continued to entertain whoever she was talking to on the phone...???Finally got to our table, and the waiter just shoved the menu at us...The food was not bad but service was sub-par. At the end of the meal, we waited a long time for the bill and had to ask for it more than 5 times but it still didn't come. We finally walked to the counter to pay but the two ladies were more interested to talk to each other than to help us....It is such a pity that this lovely place is marred by poor service.

location - Fullerton Bay Hotelpremise - coming into the space that is grand and also welcoming. With nicely done decor and also fantastic nostalgia, hotel lobby greets you with an open and warm heart. The wait staff who welcomed us in was also polite and very professional.staff - how do i express excellence? I can only say that our dedicated wait staff = Mr Arwin, was a fantastic host. He was attentive and also very welcoming. He made my Bday extra special with his good care and also fantastic service made us feel like distinguished guests.food - the lobster roll was better than what I have tried elsewhere. The starter consisting of Iberco pork in man-tou / satay / pie-tie was glorious. The only let down was the dry mid-well burger. The portion was spot on and it filled us perfectly.crowd - it is a good place for events and also for casual eats. It requires a smart casual dress code but it was welcoming to patrons in bermudas. So i guess, as long as the patrons were not in singlets (for men) it was fine.verdict - come. just come. service and food both encapsulated in a fantastic and nostalgic feel to the resto just makes you to come back. Mr Arwin of the wait staff has commendable behaviour and makes us want to go back for another good service and food session

The sort of restaurant you would expect in Colonial Singapore, aesthetically very pleasing with a relaxed atmosphere in a formal setting. Great views over the to the Marina Bay Sands and Science museum. Menus is fairly limited but the food is well cooked and reasonably priced for the location and service which was efficient and friendly from a young wait staff. The drinks on the other hand were overpriced, $120 for an average Australian Shiraz and $20 for a beer even taking the location into consideration are bordering extortionate.Would definitely return for a dry lunch :-

People come here for the Ambience: colonial, airy, with fine views across the marina bay. I found the restaurant a little too "open": lacking privacy and somewhat noisy. It's ok for a casual business lunch with colleagues. Service is fast and efficient. Menu is limited but whatever we had was decent: lobster roll, laksa. Would not rave about i

We wandered in to this restaurant while exploring the marina district and loved it. The restaurant is in a very large room/hotel entry area. But has unique architecture and large windows to look out at the marina area. The is a lot of coming and going from hotel quests. This did not bother me, but it is not an intimate setting. The food was local favorites that I thought tasted excellent. Not sure how authentic they were, but they were fantastic non the less. I had a curry chicken that I loved, my wife had satay, can't remember what others had, but everyone was happy. We had a nice wine. Service was a little distracted and it seemed to me uninterested. I would go back for sur

Had afternoon tea here on a Monday. As seen from the previous comments, the restaurant indeed has one of the best views for tea in town. Was intrigued by the menu that greatly differed from any other high tea venue that usually serve English tier sets. There was a good spread of local delicacies that tasted just like a slightly elevated version of Toast Box. Savory goodies were a little too cold, making me wonder if Lao Pa Sat just nearby could make a better version of them. Service was definitely a 2/5 for most of the waitresses seemed to be having a bad day. Staffs were slightly unresponsive and slow as well. Overall, I did not feel welcomed in the restaurant and unless I really had to, I do not think I will visit it anytime soon
5
We had dinner here it really has a colonial ambience to it with fantastic decor and space. We both had fish dishes which where very nice. The service is good but it is not cheap but you get what you pay for. It's just near the Fullerton hotel and the wharfs with its many bars. Well worth a visit
3
the title says it all. ordered a cross-section from the not-quite-a-concept menu. hits included the satay and the lobster roll. cocktails were just so-so, and took forever to arrive. wines by the glass also hit-and-miss.
4
Great destination for bringing tourists friends or business colleagues. Serving local foods in a really posh manner, this restaurant brings it all together with it's spectacular view. For some after dinner entertainment, move outside to the outdoors seating after dinner to watch the light show.
4
The restaurant occupies the newly restored Clifford Pier. Designed by acclaimed designer Andre Fu, the interior has retained the British colonial architecture of arched ceilings and high ceilings. We had tea there on a sunday, where a four piece band played old Malaysian-Singapore favourites and nostalgic songs of tea-dance days. The food was a change from the usual high tea selections, offering a taste of Singapore in the form of tea sandwiches and cakes. The setting itself is worth a visit, but do try the lunch or tea while you are there
5
Went to the Clifford Pier to take advantage of the Fullerton Heritage Special. Was a bit concerned after having a very disappointing experience at Catalunya using the same Special. However had no need to be- this was amazing! 4 huge courses of excellent, tasty food! The first course- a platter of different appetizers, was a meal in itself! Followed by soup. Then a choice of fish and noodles. Now I have found when you order fish in a Singapore restaurant your normally get a small piece. Here there were fillets of tasty fish were piled up. Then a delicious desert and coffee. There were four of us and none of us could finish! We left feeling very satisfied. We will definitely go back to Clifford Pier in future and have no hesitation of paying full price. Exactly what a special should be.Service got off to a shaky start but I gave feedback and this was completely turned round.A beautiful venue with a view, amazing flower arrangements and a good live band
4
We were here for cocktails ....it's a great venue sitting on the veranda, with good chill out music with a spectacular view of the waterfront. The ambience is charming. The wine list is terrific with delicious cocktails....St John's Island, Macha..... The service was polite.....but was slow...or perhaps laid back? Service could be a tad more slick
5
Upon arrival for our afternoon tea sitting at Clifford Pier we were greeted by a cordial host who escorted us to our table which had a wonderful view of Marina Bay.Provided with an ample selection of tea we chose an assorted selection along with our afternoon tea sets which were superb! Generous in its quantity and it's diversity, a modern twist on afternoon tea but a most welcome one!Having sampled many afternoon tea houses I can assure you there are no shortage of variations in Singapore these days, singling out one can be formidable but Clifford Pier is certainly one of the finest
5
What a truly glamorous venue! A superb historic interior with stunning luxury furnishings. This was undoubtedly one of the most exquisite interiors I experienced in Singapore. The service was perfect and the high-style hawker food quite delicious. All the courses were presented beautifully and we really enjoyed the live entertainment.If you get the chance, try and have a drink at the end of the pier overlooking Marina Bay before you dine. Highly recommende

You will see The Clifford Pier as you walk into Fullerton Bay Hotel. It takes pride of place at the end of the vast lobby which used to be the historic jetty of the same namesake. As you read about the history of the venue, the atmosphere sinks in which adds depth to the beautiful surroundings.We went to try the afternoon tea or high tea as we locals like to call it. The food was an interesting twist on the usual English tea-time but done with local flavour. Some particular highlights were the Chilli Crab Bao, Have Bee Hiam French Toast, Bak Kwa Jam Sandwich and Bandung macaroon. Among the choices of drinks were bandung, teh-terik and kopi.We thoroughly enjoyed the food but unfortunately cannot say the same for the service. The waitstaff were not up to the expected standard for this kind of higher end venue. Luckily the restaurant mangers didn't disappoint and made up for any shortfalls. Overall a lovely place with lovely food, we will definitely be back and even considering holding an event

Clifford Pier offers "authentic traditional local" afternoon tea in a beautiful setting. We have been for afternoon tea few times at Landing Point, the other restaurant at Fullerton Bay Hotel which is really great. So had quite high expectations for Clifford Pier and were looking forward to try the afternoon tea with local delights.As high as the expectations were the reality was just as disappointing. Food was really pretty bad. It was a nice selection of sweet and savory local dishes in miniature form, but the quality and taste were just very disappointing for a place like Fullerton. There are plenty of hawker stalls that offer better tasting food than what we had at Clifford Pier. Absolutely not worth to pay their price just for the beautiful setting, I would prefer to also enjoy this setting with a bite of tasty food. Do stay away from the Afternoon Tea food, do enjoy the tea and the setting if you have a chance

I brought my family to this restaurant to celebrate my wife's birthday and everyone was wowed by the ambience and decor and started taking photos. We ordered the laksa (good), lobster sandwich (good), bak kut teh (average), wagyu rendang (served almost COLD, UGH!), nasi goreng (middling).Still, we were rather happy with the place due to the beautiful relaxed atmosphere until we were told that they did not allow our birthday cake to be eaten in the restaurant! The manager didn't bother to come over to explain why either. It seemed to us like a coffee shop mentality of 'No Outside Food Allowed'. Considering the class of restaurant, not being offered any tiny treats even after knowing a birthday is being celebrated was kind of disappointing. Perhaps the overall atmosphere of the restaurant was so elegant that I expected the service to keep up. It's good enough for a date, I suppose. But I'm not bringing anyone here for any kind of celebration, birthdays, anniversaries etc, if ever.
4
Jazz live band and great ambiance. The food was local asian food so for some it might be overpriced, but for the experience of family gathering or romantic dinner it's well worth it.
5
Great place to have dinner, with good selection of wine, and both western and local cuisine. Nice ambient and courteous and friendly waiter.

We came for brunch on NY day. Surprisingly quiet. The hotel is beautiful and very impressive from the minute you walk in. We ate at the Clifford restaurant. The buffet was not as extensive as many Asian hotel buffets, but the quality of the food was outstanding. Yes, it is probably more expensive than others, but the combination of excellent food and service was a winner. In addition to the buffet brunch, you get to choose a "main course" cooked freshly in the kitchen. We had the fish and chips, suckling pig, duck. All excellent. Highly recommended.
1
Stuffy, uncomfortable and ridiculously overpriced. You should go to The Clifford if you have tons of cash you don't need and you aren't hungry. Go ahead and order the lamb chops, cut the tiny pieces of meat off the bones (two of them), put them on a cracker and make an appetizer. Then you can order the steak.. no need to worry about getting a knife.. one bite and it is gone anyway

This restaurant has magnificent ambience and a superb location overlooking Marina Bay.......a truly lovely dinning experience for my whole family. The food was reasonably priced for such a place and everything we had was good and well presented. My serving of beef rendang was a little small.The only issue that really annoyed me was that upon arrival we were asked if we wanted water and the waitress printed a clear glass bottle. It's common practice for table water to be presented in such a way so I thought nothing of it. It wasn't until We were asked if we wanted more and that I noticed the waitress unscrew the lid and the name Evian, in small letters, was on the side that I realised it wasn't table water . So we were charged $26 ++ for 2 ordinary bottles of water......a bit of a sly con I thought as table water from a jug was produced upon refusal of a 3rd bottle.....which was just as good and free
5
Fantastic evening - for both my wife and myself !!!!!!!We arrived and the setting was magnificent, the ambiance of the place was unbelievable.The food was out of this world and the service was incredible.And what great music wow soft but beautifulThe we had some red wine to top off an unforgettable evening with many photos for memories.Thank

Spent a unforgettable Christmas Eve Dinner with family at the Clifford Pier Restaurant. Good food but Poor service. No beverages were served and we were told to order Evain which was charged at $20 for a bottle which is already opened. Not even sure if its plain water refilled. Seriously, this is a Buffet dinner and why on earth do you not serve any other beverages like fruit punch/orange juice just like the other 5 star hotels do? We felt obliged to order wine as the waiter and waitress keep shafting the wine menu on our faces and keep asking if we were going to order some beer and wine which was charged at sky high prices. First and Last time to this beautiful but run by poor management and a group of rude service crew

Second time at this restaurant, which was converted from a pier. We told our son about the old days when people used to board bum boats from the bustling pier. The hotel has done a wonderful job with the decor - certainly one of our favourites because of the pretty setting. The menu by Shermay Lee is great for those who like local food - we recommend the wagyu beef rendang (we had to order this twice!) and satay. The drinks are yummy too. They've got to work a little on their desserts but otherwise a good place for a meal.

Named after the historical location of the Clifford Pier, a landing point of Singapore’s forefathers, the restaurant sticks true to its heritage, paying respects to the hawkers of the past who used to sell their street food at this very same location. As head Chef Ken Zhang merrily explains, the memory for him of helping his grandfather make and sell noodles influences his primarily local menu. The best way to get a feel of the local delights would be to sample the Heritage Bites – a platter comprising Kong Bak Bao, Kueh Pie Tee and Satay. Probably amongst the best that I've tasted, the Kong Bak Bao has caramelized Iberico pork belly slices smothered with a sweet soy sauce, sandwiched between a fluffly steamed bun.Other local highlights include a wagyu-version of the classic beef rendang – rich, coconut flavours permeate the fork-tender meat, perfect with steamed white rice.Truly showing off the versatility and creativity of the chef, however, is the Uni Glass Noodles – this cold dish, best eaten as an appetizer, has every element perfect. From the saltiness of the sea in the sea urchin to the earthiness of the land in the truffle, one mouthful of this salad offers up a refreshing explosion of flavours.And if the mains don’t showcase enough of the infusion of local flavours, the uniquely crafted desserts surely will. From Kopi-O and Teh Tarik ice creams to Banana Fritters and Love Letters, these desserts with a twist are perfect to end the waterfront dining with

Went last Sunday for a family dinner. Ambience, muisc and services - goodFood- very odd menu and salty- not good.Value for money -noAs a local, i think i tried once but wont be going back again.I dont mind paying a premium price for good food. The local food is very salty and not much favour. We tried beef and lobster roll which i think cost above $30++ which is ok. But lamb and pork ribs soup.. which cost $19 is lousy. So you see the difference. . I agreed with other review the menu is very odd for such a nice place.As for the seating.. you can request for proper dinner tables rather then sofa. But think the sofa would be idea for tea time and lounging to enjoy the ambience.
4
impress by the architect who transform this historical place to a beautiful hotel and restaurant. For the food quality, maybe it still lack of creative.
5
I would say the foods are good. Services is excellent. It was my second visit to The Clifford Pier due to great ambience which catching up with friends and family members. Definitely, I will come back again.

I went to the Clifford Pier for dinner with some colleagues. It's a really nice setting overlooking Marina Bay and the newly refurbished restaurant has a very pleasant airy feel to it. I'd been expecting a traditional fine dining menu but actually quite a lot of it looked more like a selection of very upmarket bar snacks. I chose the duck red Thai curry which was very good - tender meat and a nicely balanced sauce. The service was reasonably attentive and efficient.However, throughout the evening all of us were shifting in our seats trying to ease the obvious discomfort. The problem is that they've equipped the restaurant with chairs that are essentially lounge style with low,deep seats. They might be fine for a relaxed afternoon tea, but they're totally unsuitable for sitting up to a dining table.It's a shame really because my abiding memory of what could have been a very pleasant meal is a nasty bout of back ache! Sack the guy who chose the chairs and get some decent replacements and this place could be quite good
5
On a quiet Monday evening we enjoyed a pre-dinner drink on the covered deck, overlooking Marina Bay with various attractions in view including the Singapore Flyer in the distance. We then adjoined to the restaurant inside and enjoyed the live duo and some beautiful singing. Our meal was fish and were extremely happy with it. The staff as would be expected, were most attentive and of course courteous. All were most friendly and interested in US! Close to everything and very quiet. We finished off our evening by asking our taxi driver to take us back to the Ritz Carlton via Orchard Road so we could see the Xmas lights. A great evening in total
4
Huge space, comfy chairs. Pretty quiet on a weekday evening. Menu was rather limited in choice. Appetisers portions are meant for about 2-3 pax max. Food-wise, the menu has local dishes and western. The skinny beef satay was really tender and marinade was good. For mains, the lobster roll was good. Truffle fries was nicely crisp. Liked the not so tiny chunks of lobster meat.The pasta with kong bak, with the onsen egg ontop, was enjoyable but probably will get 'jelak' after a while. For desserts, was really keen to try the baba au rum, but we didn't. Got the key lime pie and profitteroles. Nicely sweet and tangy, that key lime pie. Would be great with a cup of coffee. If you like ice-cream, you'll like the tiny profitteroles.There was live-music as well at certain intervals, creating a very pleasant atmosphere.Service was not as attentive as anticipated, but was still good
4
Sensational space. Lots of beautiful orchids n great lighting plus a good piano playing singer. I had the black cod and hubby had the sea bass. Both very good meals. My two vegetarian diners had to have the fried rice. The only other option for them was the salads. Their opinion was that it was the crappiest fried rice they ever had! That's why I gave this place an average rating for food! Maybe it's time for restaurants of this calibre to put some really good vegetarian options!
5
Great design of the restaurant, with high ceiling and classical chandeliers. Perfect place for relax with the beautiful voice of life singing. food was tasty and taste the local flavour their high tea menu. service crew was polite and always pay attentions to the guest. strongly recommend:
4
We had a Red Lantern (SGD23) and a Pina-Co-Lime (SGD14) and we very much enjoyed the drinks as well as the quite atmosphere outside while watching the night setting in over Marina Bay.The staff was very friendly and the service was fast.The live Jazz band inside, with audio outside as well, added a nice touch to the whole setting
5
A friend brought me to this establishment once, and I was completely taken up with the place. The first thing that struck me was the perfect balance of ambiance, decor, and service. This place is great if you want good food, as well as being able to chat with friends. Service is excellent, the staff take great pains and extra steps to ensure that everything goes well with your meal. Another plus is that while it is an elegant restaurant, they don't mind if you show up in less formal wear...I was dressed in a T-shirt and jeans, and that was fine with them (although I would not turn up in shorts and/or flip flops)The food was excellent...there are many choices on the menu. Although prices are a little high, the quality is good for me, no complaints whatsoever. The staff are always ready and willing to attend to your every whim...whether you are dining solo or in a group. The live music on both occasions was great; the musicians certainly know how to control the music volume and I found that it added immensely to the ambiance of the restaurant. Well done!I'm almost certainly going to visit this restaurant again the next time I'm in Singapore
5
After reading reviews online and being mesmerised by the photos, we made our way to Clifford Pier for a nice lunch. The $29 Heritage set lunch is really affordable and the food is fantastic. We paid a bit more for their lobster roll which is a must try.Great service, stunning dining room and amazing food! Must try and I highly recommend
4
It has been a pleasant dining place to bring my friends from Australia. Spacious with privacy as the sittings are far apart.

Late lunch, very accommodating and friendly staff. Ordered local style food, well presented and tasty. Very low cost given the surroundings. A good escape from the city.
2
And it's not the place. Shame about the service and the food from the incomprehensible front of house girl to the dry and hard carrot cake. And those ear plugs are not cool when you cannot hear your customer ordering!
3
The service was excellent and ambience was really nice for afternoon tea with friends and family. However, the taste of the local food served was disappointing. Only the kong bah bao was delicious. Even though it was a high tea buffet, we did not order much for second serving as most food items were not really nice
2
Well the location is great, the room is impressive, but that's all folks. The menu is Singapore Street Food, the problem is it's not well executed, you can literally get much better food at Hawker Centres for a fraction of the price. The wine list is impressively expensive for average brands. The service is just so incredibly poor, not enough service staff, and the staff they have are poorly trained. - deliver food to table don't scan other tables in your area, look at the floor and walk back to serving station, look at wall as long as possible and avoid eye contact with all customers for as long as possible.... shockingly bad!!

The recently re-vamped Clifford Pier hosts a wonderful Singaporean Heritage Afternoon Tea. Full of novel tea time treats that are spun off favourite Singaporean local flavours this Tea Time does not disappoint.Singaporean cookbook author, Shermay Lee, curates a selection of 8 savoury and 8 sweet items to reflect Singapore’s multifavoured culinary past and present. The little 'creations are handcrafted with a nod to traditional skills and are based on heirloom recipes handed down to Shermay from her late grandmother, Mrs Lee Chin Koon, author of the famous Mrs Lee’s Cookbook and widely recognized as the doyenne of Peranakan cuisine in Singapore.' The deliciously sweet Teh Tarik being the most popular on our table I opted for the strongly brewed Moroccan Mint Tea. we kicked off with the 8 Savoury items which were topped up galore! Firm favourites were the nostalgic Kueh Pie Tee, Bak Kwa Jam Sandwich and Chilli Crab Bao. The Tropical scones were surprisingly crumbly and moist (not a norm in Singapore’s humidity), and the Pineapple-Vanilla Jam and Kaya spread were very well paired. I would say a really good scone job done by Clifford Pier!For those who have room – 8 Sweet Singaporean treats await you! The Hainanese Roti with Kaya got my attention first as did the Sugee Financier and Bandung Macaroon. The bright green Pandan Swiss Roll unfortunately didn’t deliver for me – a bit dense which was a shame as I love Pandan!This is the Ultimate Tea for those who love to savour the culinary delights of Singapore or for those that want an intro into Singapore’s long love affair of blended South East Asian cuisine. The Clifford Pier’s colonial feel is a well suited venue for the Heritage Tea with its oppulent deck and great views of the Singapore River.For a full review @ www.pearlsbounce.m

We went for the Saturday Brunch to celebrate my husband's birthday and this place was just perfect! The food was great - they call it a semi-buffet which means you help yourself to a great spread of food as well as being able to order small portions of breakfast a la carte items. The American was gorgeous as was the Russian. Nice sized portions and the staff were all super friendly. Excellent value for money - we will definitely be going back

After looking at a splashy article in the Singapore Airlines Kris magazine last week on my way to Singapore I decided the new Clifford Pier restaurant would be worth trying. The reception and wait staff were helpful and polite, the interior fitout quite beautiful with soft colours and gorgeous table orchids and the room itself was stunningly restored. The wine was good and the entrees quite tasty though ordinary. However it was the main dish of wok seared snapper with aubergine we shared which really let things down. The 3 small pieces of fish were coated in a thick crunchy commercial style batter that tasted oily and had been so overcooked it was tough to cut with a knife and the fish inside was left tasteless as if it had been frozen. Even the swirl of sauce on the plate made no difference.Worse was that my piece contained bones in each mouthful which is very dangerous unless one is eating a whole fish and expects them. After a couple of mouthfuls neither of us wanted to eat anymore and we returned the dish. It seems strange in a city of culinary excellence like Singapore where seafood is plentiful such highly regarded hotel would produce and then serve to a customer such a bad dish. Didn't anyone check the filleting or look at the plate as it left the kitchen.No amount of glamour in a setting makes up for bad cooking. Staff were apologetic for the bones and took the dish off our bill but the end result was we felt our meal at Clifford Pier was a huge let down and would not eat there again or recommend it. Save your money and eat elsewhere

This restaurant is absolutely beautiful, so I thought I'd give it a second chance. Attributed the previous bad service and food to teething problems.Well, the issues are still there. The servers are very polite and friendly....if you manage to get their attention. Servers did not know what the food items they were carrying when they brought the food out. Food items are always a hit or miss. Shermay's pork belly bun was excellent, but I wouldn't go back for anything else. For this space, it's really a waste. I wanted this to be my family's go-to place

Simply love the Fullerton Bay hotel for the beautiful architect and charming interior and lovely flowers scent. With the newly unveiled Clifford Pier that adds the charm to the already wonderful hotel. The beautifully renovated restaurant with the well conserved historic landmark is simply elegant with an enchanting view. Love the unique roof structure with the colonial feel. Just sitting here and feeling the enchanting atmosphere is already a wonderful way to spend the day, coupled with good food and service. Food is tasty, tho not fantastic or anything to rave about. Price is expensive for local delights, nonya Kueh and local desserts but considering you are paying for hotel price and the ambience, I think is worth to pamper yourself with. I'm on love with this gorgeous place and is sure to keep returning, despite the price

Beautifully decorated setting let down by:
- Boring menu
- Ordinary food
- Poor service
- Conceited management
- High prices
Fullerton Bay hotel management needs to return to the drawing board and start again

i am loathed to write this review as i love the beautiful space and elegant decor of this restaurant with a view to die for. we have been there twice for lunch, once when it first opened and another time last week when they had a guest chef being featured. the first time i attributed my poor experience to teething problems. however on both occasions, the food and not to mention the haughty and sparse service, did absolutely no justice to the lovely ambience. we did not get any water despite asking the waitress a few times. it finally arrived 20 mins later, after enduring some snide comment from the captain. the dishes were served cool, and so was the rice ( it was $5 for a bowl of plain white rice, and we had 4 bowls of rice for 6 to share so that was $20 just for white rice!). the featured food from the guest chef lee shermay, was actually tasty, so pity about the temperature it was served at. we had to ask for bigger plates to eat our food from because they expected us to eat our chicken curry and rice out of the small bread plates! the local food we tried were just poor renditions of what you would find at a food court, laksa and chicken rice were way too salty, the popiah skin and filling were chewy and dry, there was no childrens' menu so we ordered some penne carbonara for the kids and that cost $28 per serving. we enjoyed the jazz band after lunch. while we had coffee /tea and the kids had a scoop of vanilla ice cream each, we were appalled to see that tea was $15 per person (just a teapot with a tea bag period) and ice cream for kids was $9 per scoop. it was quite disappointing especially since i took the time during my first visit to write down my comments re the food, and there was absolutely no improvement. i would really like this place to do well, but if the food and service continues to stay this way, we will not come back to this place

We went for a Sunday lunch here, while on a walk.The location and setting is beautiful.I ordered Fish and Chips and my wife ordered Beef Radang. We both had lime juice to drink.We were not impressed with The Clifford Pier, supposedly of a high calibre and that was prepared to charge us S$ 109 for this.The service to take our orders started off fine. Prompt, polite and helpful.However, my wife was not given a napkin and had to ask for it. For both if us the food arrived cold and my fish and chips came without one of the core ingredients, the malt vinegar. The waiter did not tell us this and, when we pointed it out, he came back 10 minutes later, to even colder food, and offered white wine vinegar.Neither of us finished our dishes, as it was simply too cold to be tasty.When we mentioned these facts to the staff, they were polite and listened but demonstrated no empathy for the issue they had created and offered no corrective action, other than to replace the dishes. As we were on a schedule, this was not an option for us.We were charged the full price, including the +++.Disappointing, particularly when we came here and realised all the reviews are similar and the restaurant clearly has no interest in improving. We will not return ..

Visited while in Singapore as my husband had been with a colleague just after opening and had a great meal. Not so this time. We visited on a Sunday and despite a pretty empty restaurant were put right in front of the piano and couldn't hear ourselves think. We were moved on request. The best thing about the food was the chips (you could say the same about a fast food restaurant) - my husband's rendang was cold and tough, and after sending it back, it was returned with the rice in a lump which he could pick up with a fork. It had obviously been put straight in a microwave and just re-served. Not good enough! Only reason is gets 2 stars is the location and the fact that one of the staff at least cared enough to apologise profusely and be very embarrassed. My advice to him would be work in a better restaurant and thanks for trying

The place strikes me as a little neither here nor there. It has the decor and ambience of fine dining, yet the service and menu of a run-of-the-mill hotel cafe. That works, if you just wanted a bite at a hotel cafe and it happens to have the beautiful high ceiling, live jazz accompanied and 5-star decor. If you had any expectations for what's on the menu, you may be slightly disappointed with the barely there standard of a 5-star hotel cafe and squarely 5-star pricing

For full review & photos, please visit: http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2014/07/afternoon-tea-at-clifford-pier-80.htmlWas here for afternoon tea. I think the main attraction to dine here is the lavish ambience rather than the food. But somehow it's a pity that the local hawker fare does not fit into the classy ambience here... This gorgeous restaurant should serve fine dining food or at least serve other types of food rather than hawker fare. Love the charming vocal from the pianist-singer! Anyway it's really a very romantic place so i will definitely come back again. Hope the chef will continue to improve in the food quality and creativity

I never thought I would regret the passing of 'One on the Bund', the restaurant which used to be at Clifford Pier until last year. The dÃ©cor was nice, it was way overpriced (especially in those days), service was pretty bad for a restaurant of such caliber, but the food was special and very, very good! The remake of 'One on the Bund' into 'The Clifford Pier' is a mixed bag. The venue is spectacular, either by day or night. Service is slightly better than before. Prices are reasonable. But the food is truly below standard! It is indeed a good idea, for such a venue, to offer a combination of hawker and Western dishes, to cater mainly to well-off tourists. However, execution is poor. The western food is very average; for instance, you can find much better lobster rolls at many other places in town. The glorified hawker food (bak kut teh, rickshaw noodles, beef rendang, etc) is a shame to serve! If you want to showcase local FOOD to tourist friends in an air-con environment, Straits Kitchen at the Grand Hyatt would be a better choice. Take them here for the ambience and the view without exposing them to the mediocre food - tea would be perfect. I suspect management will rectify this problem soon, as it is so obvious

I decided to try out Clifford Pier recently. The venue was lovely - the room is spectacular. The food however is pretty average and nothing too special (a mix of local and western). The service was also a bit inconsistent when they got busier. A good place to take visitors from out of town if they want to dine in comfort but try local food

The setting is very chic indeed but we found the service over attentive, constant hovering which was impeding conversation and the staff member was too personal.The food was average in comparison the the other dozen restaurants we tried in the area.Had a live singer and pianist which is not my thing but we're not performing when we first arrived so did not notice them, they seemed to arrive with entree and drowned out conversation once again. Venue 10 out of 10, food 6 and atmosphere for us a 6 as wel

Do visit The Clifford Pier restaurant for sentimental reasons if you like reminiscing about the old landing jetty, bum-boats, change alley and it's colourful past. The revamp is stunning and extremely stylish, but dinner was bland and disappointing. e.g. I had to send my chicken rice back, because it tasted tough, boiled and rubbery. At $19++ you'd be better off ordering that dish from any food court/hawker stall at a quarter of the price. Or pay more and go to the Mandarin! On the upside, the staff were polite and obliging, and I was able to choose something else, so ordered pieces of fried snapper and aubergine drizzled with a sweet dark sauce. It was okay, but basically just fried fish for $28 ++ The rack of lamb was also passable, but nothing special. The menu simply does not really fit in with the fabulous setting and ambience, but if they want to stick with hawker fare, then get a really good local chef who knows what the real thing should taste like! Well done to the waiting staff and duty manager for behaving politely and without attitude over 'tough chicken problem'. The young mainland Chinese girls did not understand my english accent, but they were very sweet and did their best. I also liked the band and lounge singer. It would have been quite a boring dinner without the music
