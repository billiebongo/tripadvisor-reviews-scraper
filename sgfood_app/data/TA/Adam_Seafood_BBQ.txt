This stall, which is closed on Mondays, offers a variety of fish .... not only stingray.. to be barbequed.Howwever, do note that whichever choice of fish you decide on, the BBQ chilli sauce used is the same. As is the case with the squid rings.That said, the piquant sauce is an amazing blend of spicy, sweet, tangy flavours! The BBQ dishes comes with a separate serving of chincalok - yummy.In addition to fish, shell fish are also on offer.These BBQ dishes are served with steamed rice (separate order).... which comes in a bowl / chopsticks or disposable foam plate/fork spoon.Service is prompt and friendly

The Adam Road Food Center is in my opinion the best hawker center in Singapore. Why? Because it has two of the best dishes you can get in the city (of dozens of great dishes). Besides the nasi lemak I have already reviewed, the Adam Seafood BBQ offers you another amazing meal. My suggestion is to bring a few friends and order 3 dishes - the ace of the three is without a doubt the bbq stingray. The combination of the sweet tender ray combined with the fiery bbq sauce is unbeatable. Its spicy for sure, but in a multi-level complex way that will make the sweat pores join in the celebration. The morning glory as a side dish will make a perfect balanced meal - adding the veggies we should all eat - but with a sauce that is rich and meaty and yes, spicy. The third dish favored by my friends and I is the squid. It is served with the same bbq sauce as the ray but will be offer a different texture altogether. I have courted the lady owner for years asking me to sell me a jar of that sauce - alas without success. So I keep coming back over and over, I am persistent and as a reward i get to eat that ray and that morning glory. Go by taxi or try your luck in a normally cramped parking lot. A small tip to increase your parking luck if driving - sometimes i Find parking around the bend of the lot.Buen provech
