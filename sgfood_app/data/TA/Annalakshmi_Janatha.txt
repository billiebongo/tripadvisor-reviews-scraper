I was surprised to visit this nice vegetarian restaurant with great options and authentic taste.
The place was nice and clean with a great concept of pay what you like but the vegetarian fare was the highlight.
Must visit for vegetarians in Singapore.

Not very far from Shaw tower we decided to try this place for lunch after having read great reviews in TripAdvisor about it. Their principles are bit different. No price fixed for lunch buffet. Unlimited meals both north Indian and south Indian vareities.very clean and always crowded with people. The staff were very helpful, only self service and please remember to put the ladels on the counter trays and not in containers. The staff gets pissed if not followed. Nice ambience, and food is light on stomach.keep up the good work. The payment is made out of our own will no fixed price

If you are vegetarian and then I would recommend visiting this place. Everyday they changes their menu but you will find common things like dal, rice and rasam.I have been here several times and never been dissatisfied. I got good food all the time. Also, the interior is also good.Finally, you can pay on your whim.

Their so called concept of eat all you want and pay what you like is far from it. The cashier a female was very sarcastic when I paid what I could afford but she refused to accept and gave me a lecture!??! So is this restaurant true to its concept or forcing people to pay more. You are not keeping to your principles...I m not eating free so you should gladly accept what I pay. Word of mouth is dangerous and people will stop coming. Stay by your principles and God will bless your good work. My first and last visit...daylight robbery. Bad bad bad cashier spoiling the restaurant name. She should be replaced, she is not running it out of her own pocket so serve as a volunteer and don't go beyond that

I have been to this place for lunch quite a few times but got to review it only now. This place offers South Indian vegetarian dishes on buffet (on weekdays, don't know about weekends). The spread is quite good - chapathi or poori, with one vegetable to go with the Indian bread, white rice or pulao, sambhar, rasam and curd with pickle to go with the rice. Papad and fruit juice are also provided. Most of the dishes are good and consistently so. It is eat as much as you want and pay as much as you want!The place gets crowded and the queue to refill gets longer if you reach after 12:30 pm.A good place where you can expect consistently good South Indian vegetarian dishes. No hesitation in recommending this place.

When i Visited first i was asked to serve myself and afteri finished i asked how much to pay. The counter staff told me that as much as you can. Then i was suprised.Then i started knowing more about this concept hotel. It is being managed by a charitable trust and their concept is to feed as many human being as possible hence there is not menu- pricing concept. eat what you can and pay what you can.Coming to this restaurant in Amoy street it is just behind the Nagore dargah in telok Ayer and walkable distance from Telok Ayer station and raffles place.They serve Hot and sumptuous Vegetarian meal with north and south indian cusine. This is ideal for a Person who wish to have a meal prepared neat and clean in healthy environment. The restaurant peak time would be from 1230 - 2.30 where most of the people working in down town flock there to enjoy the meal.The restaurant ambiance is well maintained with cleanliness. Please do drop by to have a simple yet satisfying meal which is not available at other indian restaurants around the telok ayer.If you are an Indian person, you will find the taste of home and if you are non indian you will find a taste of indian cusine and the spice level of food items are kept low to medium to suit for every national. Please do note to take away your plate and drinking glass after eating. Please note that everyone working there are volunteers and be considerate and treat them with respect

Note that this is only open in the noon between 1130 - 3 PM and is very near to Telok Ayer MRT. Their main branch next to the temple of fine arts serves both lunch and dinnerWe went to this place today for an afternoon lunch. It's a decent spread as everyone else have already said. It's fresh it's hot. They make different breads on each day. On Saturday it's Chapati and my fav Appam. Don't waste the food here.While they say it's free food, they don't appreciate if you don't pay. The Lady runs towards the exit counter as soon as you finish your meal and I have heard that paying $10 per person is a norm which we did

Another satisfactory visit to this excellent place which is run by charity and You pay as much as you want for the meal.....The food is excellent, wholesome and has that "home-cooked" feel to it. The spread is wide (2 kinds of bread, 2 kinds of rice, 3 kinds of veggies and 3 kinds of curries) ... And all vegetarian. The diversity in the curries and the veggies is also excellent (the spice and cooking styles are different and thus suits most palates ) They serve appams on Saturday (cooked in front of you) .. Head there if you love those in addition to some good food

The food was pretty good, lots of flavour and a good selection but the rice had been sitting for too long and was very sticky and unappetizing. Interesting concept that you pay what you like. A good spot for vegetarians for lunch.

This restaurant serves authentic south indian food with a smile..the spread consists of many south indian dishes like idli/vada, rasam, sambhar, roti, sabji, rice, puttu, sweet, curd,etc which tastes yummy, they also keep on changing their spreads frequently.
Please book in advance before visiting.

You eat your fill and pay what you want.... it is a restaurant run as a charity to feed people. Vegetarian food and good quality

The restaurant is unique. A perfect lunch buffet. You pay what you feel is worth.I think it opens only for lunch. If you prefer to get your place, visit them between 11 -12 noon as it gets crowded later.I know it deserves more, but to start with consider atleast 5 SGD for adults and kids (as you like).A traditional south Indian vegetarian food without limits:We had the following on the day we visited there:Coconut flavored rice noodlesChappatiChanna DhaalRiceWhite pumkin sambharTomato kootuPotato, beans and cauliflower curryRasamPotato Masala (gravy)Curdbutter milkPicklePapadSwee

The food at Annalakshmi was excellent... very home-cooked, strong South Indian fare, with a decent mix of North Indian syles. Pure buffet only works well for this place as all of us are in a hurry and need to quickly sit down and eat.The Eat what you like, pay as you feel is a great concept and much appreciated. Also the fact that revenues help support arts & cultural activities through the Temple of Fine Arts is an added bonus

Hello,I have visited this restaurant several times for lunch as it is just 5 minutes from my office... they have the concept of buffet and pay whatever you feel like....the buffet options are pretty good... Food is tasty and healthy... they serve only veg food

Aside from all the social value that this chain supposedly supports, for me this restaurant is a friendly reminder that good wholesome food doesn't need to cost a lot. One doesn't see a lot of hungry people on the streets of Singapore, but if there were, it's nice to know they have a place to go.

The food is wonderful. Been there 3 times. Food taste best when you savour it with thankfulness. The old gentleman at the counter is the owner and he is most willing to explain the purpose of the restaurant and the art pieces displayed for sale. His course and his person must be respected. The lady staff cannot help it except to visit Korea if she is born with a frown. EQ, please. She is smiling when she serve the masala tea to me and my daughter. She is most graceful as she busied herself serving out the drinks. There is a young man who recommended us the benefit of each drink available. The lassi is great. There is another lady serving us, explaining to us the health benefit of ingredients used in the rasam and other dishes. Think of the people who are starving around the world. Food is sacred

I have been here a few times primarily because i was told that this has a social theme.The food is a south indian buffet with a fair selection . They do serve rotis/pooris on rotation basis. They also have some juice (usually lime),sweet and papad and sometimes raita.The problem with this joint is as follows:1. The quality of food is steadily deterioraring: Lime juice getting more and more watery,vegetables in curries lost in a large volume of liquids,items frequently run out and are not adequately or promptly topped up.2. Poor Behaviour: The lady (not sure if staff or owner)seating people is extremely unpleasant. She always wears a frown and the behaviour lacks the humility and service attitude required for a place with a social cause. 3. Confused Social belief: I was told that the original concept was that patrons can pay whatever they like which i feel is terrific as a concept. However, i think that the owners do not really believe this and expect a premium from everyone. People who will not pay as per their expectations are likely to be misbehaved with.I feel that had the quality of food and service been good,people would love to contribute as a donation rather than link value to food. But given the dropping quality and poor behaviour of staff (particularly the lady and the senior citizen at the counter), regular office lunchers would usually want value for money and pay them as they feel fit.Please note that this review is not based on my last visit alone (few days back) but from multiple visits usually with many colleagues.I really feel that they should price their buffet as their focus is clearly profit making/minimum revenues instead of allowing patrons to second guess.Else they should stick to their original principles and serve customers with a smile and with good food.If they are confused about what they are professing,better to close shop
