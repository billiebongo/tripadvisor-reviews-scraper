Quaint cafe with delicious cakes and good service. The Onde Onde cake is definitely worth trying. Ordered a Salted Caramel cake for Dad-in-law and instructions were followed to the “T”. Coffee was also good.

Food was not amazing but still good. Not too expensive. Service was very nice, waitresses were smiling and dynamic (most of them :-)). This was a good moment. Would go again!

Food is nice and reasonably priced. Interesting menu with some local dishes like assam fish and usual western fare like salmon. Music is too loud though.

Disappointed to make a trip here, only to find out that most of W39's menu is available only after 12PM, but this isn't mentioned on their website. For some reason, on Quandoo, we could only make reservations at 9AM, 11AM, 1PM if you're talking about brunch/lunch timings. So here we were, at 11AM, only able to order food off the brunch menu (which is available 9AM-5PM on weekends & public holidays). We also had to sit outdoors, which cheesed me off a little. If you're using Quandoo to reserve, make it a point to indicate whether you want indoor/outdoor seats - because I didn't ("Special requests" doesn't exactly prompt me to think of indoor vs. outdoor seats). On the bright (no pun intended) side, the fans were sufficient to keep us fairly cool, but I'd always pick indoor seats over outdoors in Singapore's humidity.The food- I'd come back for the Lamb Shank Eggs Benedict ($15++) alone, which really surprised me. The fluffy butter top loaf soaked up the runny egg yolks & hollandaise sauce perfectly. The lamb shank was also a unique & welcomed twist to your usual Eggs Benedict. If there's anything I would fault this dish for, it's that there was only 1 small mushroom in it. If your menu says mushrooms, i.e. the plural of mushroom, then please have more than just 1 lonely mushroom inside. The Savoury French Toast ($17++), on the other hand, was so disappointing. I can't fathom why this is more expensive than the Eggs Benedict!? This looks like something I've made for Mothers'/Fathers' Day in the kitchen. Granted, it's not terrible, but definitely not worth its price. Time for coffee: Flat White ($4.50++) & Latte ($4.50++) with an extra shot ($1.50++). Coffee was on the milky side, & not particularly memorable. Fairly decent & not too acidic.  Accepts credit cards Air-conditioned seats available☀️ Al fresco seats available Accepts reservations - I used Quandoo Free WiFi available️ Parking is scarc

Was there with girlfriends for a birthday celebration. We ordered 2 cakes to share and some drinks.The beer was something I hadn't tried before by definitely something I would drink again. We had a unicorn cake! We almost didn't want to slice it open but I am glad we did. It had lemon butter cream on the outside and rainbow layers on the inside! Not too sweet and we enjoyed every mouthful.We also had a slice of sea salt caramel. The chocolate cake was moist and fluffy. The sea salt caramel in between was just perfect. Not overpowering in flavour. The staff were very accommodating. We came in about 930pm, half an hour before their closing but they didn't rush us out. We ate and drank as they cleared up.Thank you for being patient! We will be back again

A quaint little bistro located on the south side of Clementi Stadium. I had the Braised Lamb Shank Sandwich which was exquisite. The flavor and seasoning were perfect and the side salad and salsa were delicious. My wife had the Pork Cheek Quesadillas which were also delicious. The Apple Crumb Tart was the "icing on the cake" and would make any American's heart happy. The drinks were refreshing. The only downside was the absence of a children's menu. The service was pleasant and the ambience was quiet

I frequent W39 at least once a month. Its a cosy cafe situated at west coast. I totally love the ambience both the inside & outside. The staff are very friendly & efficient. The food they provide is reasonable in terms of pricing. At the same time super delicious too. You wont regret your visit to this lovely cafe
4
It's a pleasure to find this little cafe tucked away in a sleepy corner of a private estate. You really have your work cut out for you finding this place if you're not familiar with the area. The food served is simple and tasty. Don't expect 'chef-y' food here but what they do, they do well. The staff are friendly and attentive.

Went to the cafe in search for wifi and coffee on a lazy saturday afternoon. The service was good and so was the coffee and across my table, i saw some other customers ordering their duck confit which smelled really good as well. The service was also excellent. i'll consider coming back here again if i'm in the West

Since we are nearby west coast park, so decided to give this little cafe a try since we miss it last time. It is located in quite a distance from Clementi MRT station. The food served is fast even though there are quite some crowd inside. While waiting for our food, the cafe have some nice little prop for us to take photo with. We have ordered har cheong gai chicken wing, truffles fries, carborana and sharperd pie. The food came in quite a big portion and taste delicious except for the chicken wing. The price is in expensive and we enjoy ourselves, i do see a lot of people bring their dogs and sit at the outside of the cafe. Highly recommended to try

Nice restaurant, on is very good for if you want a late, lazy Sunday breakfast..bit pricy for the location, but it is the only dissent place in the west coast area..
5
I had the beef burger, it was so yummy. My friend had the linguine and he said it's the best he ever had! 10/10! Duck confetti is 9/10, Salad is 8/10.
4
There is a wide range of breads and cakes for choice. The mains and sides are decent too. The ambience is cosy, and there are aesthetics which reminisce to our childhood days. Overall, it was a pleasant place to chill, and relax.
5
A nice hideout especially on a weekday when it's not so crowded. Weekends would be crowded, so need to make advancement booking. Cosy cafe with good food with slightly step pricing.

Chanced upon this place and it was a quiet afternoon. What a gem!Great service and good coffee. Waffles were delicious and their other savoury dishes are good as well. Fried calamari was cooked just right, and sake mussels.. Yum. The cakes looked great, will probably try them next time. At the counter they have sweets and candy from when we were kids - pop rocks and push pops etc. Had a few laughs just sticking a candied foot into a bag of pop rocks - good fun. Will definitely come back again.

Went there for brunch, the place is pretty packed with people and pets. It's good to know there's a pet-friendly restaurant around.Lamb shank eggs ben is awesome! Chef's Special Nyonya Mee Siam is nice and very tasty. The classic mint lemonade is really refreshing. Service is good too. Will be back for sure :
5
We enjoyed our Sunday brunch here and it was a very nice experience. Staff was very friendly and quick. We received our order very quick and everything was well prepared and looked tasteful as well. You can sit both inside as outside, both nice and they play relaxed music. Will definitely come here more often to try everything else on the menu

Happy New Year! Went over this morning, first time. Nice corner cafe tucked away in a quiet corner with choice of indoor or al fresco dinning. Such a beautiful morning for a new year 2017 we decided to enjoy the surroundings outside. Neighbourhood was nice, breezy & quiet ...possibly due to most people sleeping in after the count down parties. Nice outdoor seats with music to wake up to in the morning. Ordered: Hearty breakfast $18, Egg Benedict with smoked salmon $15, iced mocha $6.50 and coffee $4.50. Food was mediocre, nothing to shout about. Bacon in the hearty bfast' was not crispy, generally food and drinks not served piping hot. Just warm. Only needed that slight but crucial improvement to win me over. The only saving grace was the location of the cafe situated in a housing estate of landed properties. A bit pricy for the standard I'd say.Parking: open air and along the road, coupons $0.65/half hour

We did a shoot mid 2015 so we had the outdoor seating by choice. Though I am supposed to focus on the taping, I was actually more interested in the food and place. The bistro is little bit hard to find if west coast is not your place. I ordered a grilled mushroom appetiser it comes with i think 4 slices of wild mushroom for quite a price. Nice plating but a little bit too oily and chewy. Their bakeries was OK but definitely the kind where you gotta consume 1-2 hours after purchase. The mains were OK but nothing special for such a price. Had the beef though

Came by this place after seeing the rave reviews on TripAdvisor - so we drove down to this little "tucked-away" corner cafe and entered. The server's first question was "Do you have a reservation?", which normally would indicate the popularity of this place.So we did not, and were then shown to the outdoor seating (fortunately the weather was not too hot).The seats and table were small and quaint like any old-school Chinese coffee shop - you're meant to sit and have your coffee, and then get up and go immediately.So we ordered the below items:- Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon ($15.00)- French Toast with Bacon and Sausage ($17.00)- Long Black ($3.90)- Iced Chocolate ($6.50)The long black was pretty OK, strong and not too acidic. It was a shame that the raw sugar packets for the coffee that they placed outside on the shelves were damp (probably due to it being exposed outside).The iced chocolate was good as well.The eggs benedict, funnily enough was cold on the inside, an indication that it was re-heated rather than cooked-to-order. The only thing good was the toast which the eggs and salmon were served on - it was soft and tasted freshly-baked.The french toast was similar - soft and freshly-baked, unlike any other french toast we have tasted before in many other self-proclaimed (hipster) cafes. The bacon however was cold and not crispy at all.The experience of having brunch at W39 was quite alright - there was a bustling crowd once the clock struck 10am on a Saturday morning. Outdoor seating is right beside the roads plying the landed housing estate, so while it may be quiet early in the morning, one can imagine the traffic building-up outside becoming a distraction as nearly every vehicle driving past are patrons coming to visit W39.Parking is very limited, so do come early. Servers were chirpy and friendly, though the place was bustling and hard to get their attention especially if you're seated outside.All in all the bill came to $46.65, with a +10% service charge, but no GST. Slightly overpriced, methinks... especially when it was only the toast/bread that outshone the rest of the food on the plate

Have ate here many times and its never disappointed . Everything on the menu is great ..try the coffees too
4
Like the location and the ambiance of W39. I like the food there in general, too. My only complaint is the fact that the menu is very limited and they hardly update it.

This is a nice neighbourhood brunch place. A bit off the beaten track, but good if you live in Clementi or Jurong area. We went for lunch on Sunday. The local dishes -- mee siam and nasi lemak -- were sold out, which is a good sign. I had the quinoa salad, and my partner had seared salmon. Tasty, well prepared, with serving sizes and prices lower than a more central equivalent like PS cafe. Small menu, but good coffee and the iced lemonades looked good. There's a laid-back ambience and even at 1.00 pm on a Sunday it wasn't crowded. Service friendly, although they tend to bring orders in batches rather than all at once, so some people end up waiting. Baked goods are decent, too, with slightly sweet brioche-style breads and slices of cake featured prominently. Got the rainbow cake for my mother-in-law but have not yet given her it so can't report back on that yet

If you are staying in the West and is craving for some decent food and cakes but does not feel like travelling down to town, you might want to consider visiting W39, a small little bistro and bakery, hidden at the corner of Jalan Mas Puteh, off West Coast Road.With a cozy home-style look to it, W39 Bistro & Bakery served European styled dishes, subtly enhanced by an array of local and regional ingredients. There are a wide range of breads, cakes or tapas for your mid-day snacks, brunch, lunch or dinner.Read more about my dining experience on darrenbloggie.co

We have been here for too many times. It started all good until we ran out of menu to order, they have good food with not too big selection so we got bored. But, the coffee is always good so many times now we just come here for their coffee.Their staff is nice and my youngest son loves their peanut butter cake.I love their crab cakes and their tuna. They said they would rotate their menus and change regularly... I really hope so because I like everyone there!
4
Hard to find but when you find it, it is actually a little gem in the neighbourhood. Some nice beers, cakes and burgers. What else do you need?! Staff is attentive and the place gives you a neighbourhood like feel between de landed houses instead of high rise Singapore buildingsFor sure one of the best West Coast restaurant
4
Nice cafe, child and pet friendly. Good food and set up.. A glance of Roberson Qay in clementi 4 mins walking from our condo. Bit pricy for the area, but it is ok once in a while..:-)Good for brunch or if you want to chill in the afternoon

We went for a family brunch. The location is a bit hidden even though just off West Coast Road. There's comfortable enough space to sit inside or out. Given the heat we went inside. The place despite its location has a Tiong Bahru cafe vibe though maybe more family oriented than just a young singles scene. The menu has plenty of good options. My wife ordered the breakfast set, son had the beef shepherds pie and I had the Mee siam with a side of fries, a passionfruit ice tea, blue lemonade and apple juice. My wife loved her scrambled eggs as she claims very few places get it right in Singapore. She also liked her toast but the mashed potato side wasn't that good. My Mee siam was very good but lemonade was ok. My son's pie was decent, but the fries were excellent. And my wife's passionfruit tea recommended by the waitress was delicious. The staff was very helpful and friendly. After all the food we would have liked to try one of their standard cake choices but were too full. All in all, a very nice find. The only knock on the location being that you would be more likely to visit if you were a neighborhood resident. Nonetheless, we have family in the neighborhood and can always pop in here before visiting them

Trying out a new place every month for regular gathering with friends. Small cafe, friendly young servers and good food presentation. Had 2 appetisers and 2 main courses with a dessert. There was a 1 for 1 wine promotion at night and discounts for beer till 8pm. There were a few misses in the case of crab cakes (too bland) and chocolate cake (supposed to be best seller but a bit too sweet for me). This bistro is hidden from the main road but it's probably less than 5 mins walking distance from nearest bus stop. If you happen to be in this area, can give it a try

We went there after reading some reviews. We enjoyed trying out different cafes. This one was good for the ambience. Limited parking lots. I ordered salted caramel cake, Oreo cheesecake, sautÃ©ed garlic and paprika prawns and a pumpkin soup. Salted caramel cake was really soft and melt in the mouth texture. Oreo cheesecake was a little too dry and a little overly sticky texture. The prawns was fresh and taste was just nice. The pumpkin soup was tasty.Their price were reasonable. The staffs were really fast and attentive, very polite.
4
Went there on a weekday for dinner. There are both outdoor and indoor seatings but I find the seatings indoor are a bit too cramp. Food is not bad and quite reasonable. They sell bread too. Overall, I like the ambience...
4
This is a really nice cosy cafe by the west coast. I didn't knew it exist before until my curiosity took me for a walk..
Nice cafe/bistro. The over all ambience has a natural bright welcoming feel to the place.

We had the following items on Executive set lunch which was superb1)SABA mackerel ( be careful of the bones ), very tasty nonetheless2)Pan Fried Salmon which was one of the best that i have tasted.The Best was the SEARED TUNA FOR $5 ( which comes as a promotion with 2 mains ) We will back ...for sure

location - tucked away from the main street, make sure you use a GPS. It's nestled in a residential area. Some coupon parking available but be weary of summon folks when they come by. An they do come by quite regularly.premise - compact inside with a big kitchen due to their baking needs. Inside seats about 20 pax and outside seats another 16pax. Basic decor but serves its purpose.staff - friendly enough folks to make you feel welcomed. Attentive as well and polite.food - the warm salad was a 1st for me and i loved it. it was good and interesting. the fried pork chop was also a healthy portion. the chocolate cake with ice cream was also good. went off with a smile to the face. and oh, they serve beers as well.price - usual bistro pricing so nothing to shout about.verdict - may go back again to try other food but not really a must for me
4
Visited with some friends some time back and Hana (my toy poodle) tagged along too. Staffs are very welcoming and prepared water for her too. Do mention if you are bringing pets along so that they can arrange an outdoor area for you. Food is decent, will be back! Great service and attentive staffs

Good local joint, popular with locals in the area. Mee Asian was brilliant for the sambal, but "glassy" shrimp in the Mee Siam detracted from the otherwise good rendition.Think their "Warm Caesar Salad" is a really acquired taste. Loaded with ingredients but the heat wilts the greens, making the rendition somewhat mushy and like a "cabbage" melt of sorts. That said, it kinda "grows on you" - the more you have of it, the yummier it gets.Big breakfast did not disappoint, was good for portion/price mix. Huge disappointment was the prosecco by the glass - literally one third full on arrival (terrible portioning) and there were black specks on the inside of the glass!! Not cool...Service though was attentive and polite, and a nice and pleasant experience given Singapore's poor F&B service culture these day

Went here with my husband and our little Ewok(shih tzu) for dinner, and were delighted to know that they allow pets. They allow pets outside the restaurant but not inside, which is fine with us since we prefer the outdoor seating. Food was ok and service.. well, it could be improved. The person opening our wine didn't know how to open it so i had to open it for him. Ok the food, we were intrigues by the Baked Caesar Salad as we do not know what to expect, but when it came, the plate was hot and when we tasted it, it was sooo good. I have the Miso Marinated Sea Bass which was delightful, and husband hada wagyu burger, We also ordered prawns, theyre ok. Overall, i would like to come back for Brunch but i imagine it being crowded since it is in a neighborhood area and i suppose people that live there with dogs would go. Oh, and the cakes were not too bad either, I had the chocolate fudge and husband had the carrot cake. theyre both pretty good

west coast is actually pretty good area to explore singapore. there's w39, a brunch cafe like many others sprouting up all over singapore, there's west coast plaza (a shopping centre) just down the road, a hawker centre and wet market just opposite west coast plaza, and there's west coast park a short walk away.i've been here twice with my partner, and both times we were wowed by the cakes (selection differs, refer to display) more than the brunch items. the chocolate ones especially. definitely quality chocolate.we'll return to try their nasi lemak, their own take on the local coconut milk flavoured rice. it looked really good, served with a big fried chicken leg, cucumber slices, a poached egg (it's traditionally hard boiled or fried), and sambal chili. we saw a few tables having it the last time we were there, and everyone looked satisfied with their nasi lemak

A friend heard good reviews for this place and decided to try out with our fur-friends since it was supposedly pet friendly. "Pet-friendly"- hearing my friend let out an "Oh" when we first arrived, I knew it wasn't the kind of place he expected. There was nothing pet friendly about the place when we can't sit inside, neither do they have anything on the menu for our fur kids.Anyway, it was too late to change venues as we purposely drove down to this place and were fuelled by lunch time hunger.I was torn between the Eggs Benedict and Hearty Breakfast ($16) (scrambled eggs, sausage, Bacon, mushrooms, rocket, broiche). Seeing that they recommended the hearty breakfast I decided to go with the latter.They got the part "hearty" right as the portions were quite huge but I don't see why it should be the most popular item on the menu. It was mediocre, the sausage was bland beyond belief. My friends ordered the "Chicken for 2" ($39) to share, no complains from their side so I supposed it was nice other than the fact that it's a bit pricey for just half a chicken. We also ordered the pancakes ($10) to share as dessert. If I was blindfolded and asked to guess what I was eating, I could probably never tell what it was. It was no where near fluffy, in fact, it was hard. I don't know how's that possible for pancakes but they managed to do it. We just couldn't bring ourselves to finish it. Why waste your calories on something that's horrible right?After lunch, we all decided that this was the last time we would visit this place. And perhaps, I should have just ordered the eggs benedict after all.

My family and I decided to come here for lunch with our dog because we heard that it was a pet-friendly cafe. However, when we got there, we could not even step into the cafe with our dog and we had to sit outside. The servers there were not friendly to our dog either. The food there is not fantastic. Average and typical western food that you can find in any other western restaurants. Half of the items on the lunch set menu were not even available when we arrived. There weren't even any dog-friendly food or even water provided for dogs unlike other pet-friendly cafes. To pet owners who were considering bringing your pets along for lunch, just give this place a miss and go find a real dog-friendly cafe where your dogs are actually welcomed and treated warmly. How can you even call yourself a pet-friendly place when basic water cannot even be provided for the furry friends that patronize the place
