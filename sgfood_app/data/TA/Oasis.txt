Truely amazing place to just get away and have good food. I would recommend it to all my friends. We had a good sergeant named Yan Yuin.
5
We had 30 people come for CNY we were made to feel very welcome. A must if you are visiting Singapore and have a free day night.
5
The staff are excellent, the food is wonderful and the ambience is also fantastic. We have been coming to this relaxing and casual poolside restaurant for years, every time we visit Singapore. The Mee Goreng is my favourite dish, also the menu is really, really good. The Manager is very professional and friendly, the team work very hard to make sure guests are happy. Cannot speak highly enough of them!!!

We organized a big networking event at Oasis restaurant.Everything went perfectly. The team was very professional. They perfectly respected the timing.The food was very good.We definitely recommend this place!Thank you again

I would like to thank team of Oasis who has been looking after us during our stay.Specially Tango, Sienna and Yan have been remarkable.Would highly recommend the food and surroundings.Thumbs up

Celebrating my friend’s birthday and we opted for their BBQ buffet with free flow drinks. Impeccable service! The glass of bubbly in my hand were never emptied as they were so quick to refill the glasses every time we sipped. Service staff were attentive and always have a ready smile.Food were served by courses, any item we liked, we could order again separately. Loved their oysters and shrimp on ice as well as their BBQ fare, steak and rack of lamb were also cooked to perfection. As this is an outdoor location, by the hotel pool, houseflies and huge ants would be present but all were quickly forgiven after the third glass of prosecco!
5
Amazing food and amazing booze!!! Staff is really friendly... if you’re an ex at in Singapore you should come here
5
Great food, great staffs and great location.A must chill bar with a few Pinot Grigio and ask for Francis to look after you.A gem and a asset to this bar.A must try his their tomatoes and water melon salad.My 9th visit and I always have a drink in this bar. It’s an oasis.L

Brilliant. I do not want to write this review as I don't want too many people to go to Oasis!! It is my favourite location!!! We went there, by accident, and had a great time as the service was fantastic (make sure you get served by Tango and/or Senna). Location is brilliant, next to the pool on the 5th floor, so great atmosphere. Food is not "leading edge" but good, solid reliable BBQ, roast, grilled foods as well as superb oysters and massive prawns. But it is good solid food - and with free flow alcoholic drinks it only costs SGD80+++. My sister came to visit us from UK and of all the places we took her, Oasis was the winner. Will we go back? Yes, every other week we try and go back. We love it as does out daughter and the service makes us want to go back

We are doing hotel restaurant hopping for our vlog site and good thing we came across Grand Hyatt Hotel in Orchard as they said there's a nice cozy ambience on the 5th level where u can just chill and relax while enjoying the great food. They are famous for bbq dinner buffet with free flow of drinks and wine but unfortunately we were there at the middle of the day anyways we still enjoyed the ala carte menu being offered plus what's more important is the service provided by the staff..really knows how to value their customer as always showing "service with a smile". Kudos to Emmanuel and Sienna who are sooooo friendly and nice to us and Emmanuel knows how to suggest the best food they have! I hope Grand Hyatt Hotel will give compliment to these kind of staff as u can hardly see people like them in the hotel service line nowadays esp in SG..so keep it up! And we will be back soon..i want to try the dinner bbq buffet next time cheers

Came here on a Friday night. No air con. BBQ. The air was smokey so bad for dry eyes and nose. Range of food was limited. Long queue for the small burgers so I didn't get to eat that. Dessert was quite good.
4
Indeed an oasis in bustling Singapore shopping belt. Quiet & Serene up on 5th Level of the Grand Hyatt.Foodâ€™s decent and the staff really outstanding especially Sienna from Korea. Extremely helpful and recommended the stuff that was good. My Wife and I ordered the nasi goreng & the bbq tiger prawns. It was good recommendations by Sienna.Sienna was friendly, helpful and wow us with a cup of cut fruits after our meals.Great job, Sienna!RegardsD An

Anyone who has ordered drinks in Singapore knows how expensive it can be. If you've ordered food in the Orchard Road area it can also be pretty pricey, and if you've ordered food and drink in Orchard you may have needed to take out a second mortgage.So where can you get good quality food and free flow drinks in a really nice location on Orchard at a reasonable price? Oddly enough, at one of the smartest hotels! The BBQ at Oasis at the Hyatt is a really great deal. I've done it a few times and always had a great time. The food is barbecued right there and there's a good range of salads, veggies and fresh seafood as well.Room for improvement would be a bit more variety on the meat options and more speed from BBQ to plate. If you get your timing wrong the food can be a bit dry. However, these are minor points. The food is great, the location is lovely, the staff are really nice and it's a really good deal
4
my family had BBQ buffet on this Friday night. At pool side, felt very relaxed.I am very appreciated to kind and attentive staff. they r always smiling and caring.Food was good , too(a bit limited range of food but still ok). especially free flow drinks r best benefit. We absolutely go back again.Special thanks to staff Sienna. (love her smile :)
5
We stayed here on two separate occasions in August. Dined here both times with the family. Fantastic food all around but the best part is the very attentive, friendly and professional staff. We are quite discerning travelers and this place rocks! Recommend their angus sirloin steak and oyster on half shelf. Highly recommend Oasis to unwind after a long day.
4
With almost four hours of free flow drinks and buffet at just around $100, Oasis offers great value for money. While selection of food might be a little limited, it's still a fun place to go with big groups of friends for good weekday happy hour. The staff, especially Sienna, was very accommodating and attentive too.
4
I visited the buffet brunch about 6-8 weeks ago for a friends birthday, the buffet started a little early for me as I work until 6pm however Francis ensured that we were looked after very well to make up fro being a few hours late! The food was great, the red meat went very quickly though. And the cocktails/ prosecco were great. Big thanks to Francis for being the best host
5
Excellent service, great staffs, superb food. They really took care of everyone be in house or business. Service with love
5
Myself and 9 other friends went to the evening free flow buffet last week. Sienna was our waitress and she was fantastic - couldn't ask for any better service. All the food was very good and I would definitely recommend this dinner option to anyone living or visiting Singapor
3
I'll not recommend this place for food or drinks at the prices charged. Food selection limited and quality low for Hyatt's standard and price charged.When I was there this evening, I was the only local.There's a pool by the side...al fresco...probably cater more for expat. Definitely can get better quality & value somewhere else
5
Great place near pool. Impressed food & service. Especially thanking staff Sirena. Really had a good time for her warm & kind service. I will be there with my boy & girl.
4
We went here last night for a birthday celebration and I wanted to thank Nami our waitress who kept the free flow drinks topped up with prosecco and Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc. The food was lovely and setting was very nice. Thank you

Having been a frequent customer over the years most recently only 6 weeks ago, I have just returned from an evening at Oasis with guests that has been utterly disappointing. This event has changed in those 6 weeks from a delight to a disaster. The event is billed as a BBQ. There was no steak. Hardly any red meat at all, some average cubed lamb was all that was on offer. 6 weeks ago the lamb chops (on the bone) were succulent and tender, 6 weeks ago they had sirloin steak which was beautiful. By 8pm tonight they'd either run out or never had any to start with. Finally as we were told to make our final drinks order at 8:55pm for a 9pm "bar closed" imagine the disgust at the next table pouring from a fresh bottle of prosecco at 9:55pm.I'm very upset that I billed this place as somewhat special to my visitor friends only to be treated to a below average night. I will not return any time soon and would urge others to give it a miss. Terrible disappointment this evening.
5
Very good selection of BBQ meat and mini burgers. Not the widest selection of food but it was all very good. The staff were very friendly and attentive
4
The restaurant is in the grounds of the hotel next to the pool. Its my restaurant of choice for a late breakfast or lunch. Nice back drop relaxing, chilled with good service. The food is always good and the perfect spot to kick back for a late afternoon cocktai
5
Wonderful and friendly staff. A great place to enjoy the day and chill out with good food.Will definitely visit again
5
Poolside, very chilled, great food and ambience, lives up to its oasis name. Really enjoyable time her
5
What a great afternoon with friends. Food was fantastic and the service staff were so friendly and helpful. Kids enjoyed a swim and the adults got to enjoy the drinks! Best value in tow
5
Great afternoon with the kids playing in the pool and some good food. Francis was friendly and made sure we were well looked after. Hyatt turned it on!
5
Awesome food and awesome service. Loved the ambiance too. If you are ever looking for a quiet spot to enjoy great food with excellent company look no further.
5
My company organised my farewell party in this beautifully located restaurant. It was a great experience mostly because it was a free flow (wine, beer, cocktails, bubbly....) and the most delicious food from the buffet. It included fresh oysters, seafood, different types of grilled meat, various salads, desserts and "make your own" noodles dishes.... Really good and fresh.A great thank you to all the hard working staff members who really made an extra mile in serving us, especially to Francis who was very professional and entertaining! Well done
1
The food at the Oasis BBQ was quite nice although the choice was very limited.But be warned - there is a 9PM deadline for the "last pour" of the free flow drinks and from that moment on the staff will do anything they can to get rid of you as soon as possible even though the restaurant officially closes at 10. There was no advanced warning of this when we made our booking for a birthday party of 5 at 7:30. The BBQ stopped being refilled way before 9 (although the chef did cook an extra plate of stuff for our table) and the staff were cleaning away dessert before 9 too forcing us to make a grab for what was left before we'd even finished our other food.When you're paying more than $100 a head being made to feel unwelcome and virtually swept still hungry out of the restaurant 1.5 hours after arriving is absolutely disgusting.NOT recommended
4
Oasis restaurant is located next to the rooftop swimming pool at the Grand Hyatt hotel on Scotts Road. We have visited several times and the long serving staff are always attentive and tuned in to their customers, which is not always common in SG. Food is both delicious and plentiful. The free flow F&B BBQ has to be about the best value for money experiences that you will receive in Singapore. A great place to bring family and friends that are visiting. We will continue to return to Oasis in the future

Had a number of lunches and evening dinners in Oasis. Menu doesn't change from lunch to dinner except there is a BBQ for dinner (all you can eat / drink). From the menu the food is good, all freshly cooked and arrives quickly, salads are crisp and fresh. Nasi Goreng is a good dish. In the evening the food is BBQ based and is good too...it could be a little warmer if you pick from the already cooked food but they will cook fresh for you as well. If you are vegetarian they will change the menus to suit you...Biggest drawback is that the evening food stops at 9pm, so this is a little early.Overall though a lovely setting, absolutely superb team of people who go the extra mile to help... and the food is comforting and good! Will always eat her
5
Had lunch with my wife on Sunday. Menu not very extensive, but varied from Western fare to local type cuisine. Food well prepared. What stood out was the waiting staff. Very attentive & efficient. Will definitely return.
5
Great location for chill. Nice environment. Good food and beverage. Great to try weekend bbq buffet, it's worth!
5
Wonderful service by tango the oasis manager.The food is very fresh and well prepared. Had an great night! Definitely will come again!

Had dinner at the Oasis Pool-side Buffet over the weekend. I think if it wasn't raining so hard it would have been a lot nicer sitting around the pool, however, it wouldn't have done anything for the food options. Unlike Mezza that has a fantastic selection with excellent quality, Oasis was a disappointment. I believe if you're an oyster fan it is worth the money, however, if not I would suggesting eating at one of the other restaurants. If it wasn't for the vegetarian station (which was decent) my entire family would have had to go to dinner after "going to dinner". No one in our family is a vegetarian but it was the best option. There was also a birthday party going on at the same time. I'm fine with a party, however, when the guests are all standing around the buffet chatting and drinking it made getting to the food very difficult. Seemed chaotic. The best part of the restaurant is the service. The wait staff is attentive, professional and on-top of their job. Well done. It's truly a shame the food quality/options aren't held to the same standards. As a huge fan of the Hyatt and as a Club at the Hyatt member, this experience was very disappointing. If it wasn't for the free flow wine it would have been a total bust
3
The restaurant is next to the swimming pool. Actually it looks more like a pool bar than an actual restaurant. Not really much atmosphere there, it looks practical but not particularly good.If you try the Dinner buffet menu - free flow of meat/vegetable/drinks, it is fine. Not great but not terrible. Quality of the meat and the food is OK, vegetable are average, price of the menu is acceptable, drinks are included. Nothing special but for some situations, it may be a valuable offer. Note that if you buy drink outside the Dinner buffet menu, price of drinks are absurd. I was quoted 29.5 SGD for a glass of poor-to-average white wine, which I returned as it is an absurd price even by Singapore standards
5
Weekend happy hour promo, poolside dining, good quality food and excellent service staff, what more can you ask fo
5
Perfect place for a pit stop during this Formula one. Unlimited beef, chicken, lamp, seafood and oyster. Not forgetting the key attraction, unlimited pour of beer, wine, cocktails and juices. Unfortunately these have to be consumed by 930pm
3
Went there on 8th Jul 2016.First time dining in alfresco. It was very warm and drinking wine is not helping the situation( wine comes in the buffet )Food wise not much variety but the wine was good. The worse thing is, the female washroom has no toilet rolls and that is the only washroom on that level when we ask the waiter. There is only one cubicle as the other cubicle is for shower. We asked three times for it after 1hour each and nothing materialise. Perhaps it is too "grand", thus it takes more than 24hours to replenish the toilet roll
2
I've been to this restaurant several times over the last year as I am member of the spa and this restaurant is just next door. So, I've eaten here on at least half a dozen occasions only because it is convenient. this bistro by the pool only an okay alternative for a brunch for locals and visitors if you happen to be on scotts road and can't think of any where else to go . The meals are average, coffee nothing to write home about, the juice has been sitting around for a long time and so has that bitter after taste. You are paying a lot for sub standard fare.we tried the seafood buffet and it is an extremely poor way of spending 100$ per head as the wine they supplied is best described as a pipe cleaner and the seafood are all overly grilled and greasy. it is at best, a 20$ meal.The only Plus point is that it is one of the few outdoor places that that is not like a sauna or a fish market. so, you can actually talk and eat in some comfort
4
We had a enjoyable dinner at the restaurant. The staff were very attentive and polite. One suggestion is that it would be nice if they can have more fans around the restaurant as it can get very warm
2
Ladies night on Thursdays @ $49++ seems like a pretty good deal. BBQ buffet, chilled oyster and giant prawns on ice, Peking duck station, choose your own stir fry mee station, softserve ice cream on tap. Sounds good right? Nope, the food is a shame, other than the delicious giant prawns (be it grilled or iced), the rest of the food are all a let down. BBQ stuff were cold and hard, oysters were flat and skinny... The food is really mediocre.. Saw two caucasian chefs walking around and tasting the food (maybe the executive chef and sous chef), I think they feel the same! In the end, we were there for what its for, the free flow drinks: Prosecco, beer, Margaritas, juices, red and white wine. We just treated it as a visit to a free-flow bar, took some crackers from the peking duck station and chatted the warm, humid and mosquitoes-infested night away. Pity the gentleman that came with us as they were charged S$99++ per person. Is it worth it? Only if you drink (like a man) and is a lady and go on Thursday nights.If you are not, then please do not go. You can spend your money better elsewhere.Another thing to add: the staff were very rushed, but its not their fault as they are barely enough of them, and they practically have to run all over the place. They had no time to be serving slowly and delicately. I think each night is a fitness work out for them in that sweltering heat
5
Pool drink service, day beds for swimming.. Food was superb (we had buffet as part of a conference)Staff fantastic, very attentive.Best Singapore slings in Singapore
4
Thursday night is Ladies Night around Singapore. This is an excellent, central location. Oysters and huge prawns, tasty roast duck, sausage, grilled veg, fish, chicken,beef- small but well done .... good choice of side dishes... the service is lovely and they are very quick to top up to your glass (prosecco, red/white wine. margaritas)..... the biggest downside is that it is by the pool and outside - Lord knows what happens when it rains (it does in Singapore occasionally!) and it is very hot and humid. There are a few fans but no a/c as it is totally open. I would do it again but probably with a small group of no more than 3 or 4.... it is quite a short serving period (6.30-9pm
3
With wines and spirits thrown in, Sgd49++ was a great deal for ladies.Buffet started at 630pm and ended at 9pm. Bbq included steaks, lamb chops, chicken, fish and prawns. Cooks were slow in toppinv up the servings and by 8pm, there was always at least a 10min wait just to taste the steaks. Roast duck platter was not refilled. Stir fry veg also had no refills after a diner emptied tgd mushrooms. Cold platter of prawns was the best, oysters not bad. Did not get to taste desserts as they were cleared out by the staff by 9pm. Unlike other buffets, the staff did not come round to alert us to take our last helping of food before they are cleared.Saving grace was the good service by the waitresses and quality of good served.Advice to future diners is to be there as early as possible and try to sample everything by 8pm. Else, it becomes a struggle with the limited choices left
5
Been here a few times now. Firstly, be ready for no aircon; you are outside at the poolside BBQ restaurant. The setting is great, particularly if you are out behind the pool on the decking. And whilst the kids might find the pool very tempting, I don't believe you can use it if you just go to the restaurant. The food is great. It's all BBQ meat with salads and a dessert bar. Good quality and reasonable range, and for $98++ with prosecco, wine, beer and margheritas, this is one of the best value brunches around. And the kids buffet has a good range and they often have entertainment for kids as well. Just enough to allow you to complete a conversation and grab another cocktail.
4
Been there for alacart buffet before. It got a wide range of meat for u to choose from and the ambience is good especially when u go there for anniversary celebration
3
Nice but not fantastic. For those who love bbq, they should come here... Wine, beer, bbq, nice outdoor environment ....
4
There were BBQ items such as prawns, beef, chicken, spicy fish, lamb chops and vegetables etc grilled on the spot. You could also choose your own ingredients in which the chef would whip up vegetables/noodle dishes, that I particularly loved. Went on 10 March and the restaurant was full. This was a return visit. We were seated near the pool again, and service could have been a bit more attentive. Food could also be served up faster as every time we went over, we had to stand and wait so long for the food to be churned out. Especially the seafood on the ice, in which I only managed to grab two oysters towards the end of the buffet. Booze was good and that probably was the savior of the day
5
My fiance and i had a lovely time at Oasis Restaurant on Valentines day. The staff were polite and friendly. Great experience. Will definitely recommend and go back again
2
Food selection was limited, no air condition. The free flow of drinks and food is till 9.30pm. If you are there for catch up with friends, got to adjourn to another place.
4
We had the buffet in the evening, and got a table by the pool. Very refreshing to sit outside, and the atmosphere was nice. The buffet had a good selection of sea food and grilled meat, the grilled prawns and oysters were especially nice. Overall the food was very good, and the staff were friendly and attentive. The drinks were however a bit disappointing
1
Don't bother with lunch, buffet in the evening a much better choice. Salads were bland, chicken wasn't fresh and I think it's the most I've ever paid for a salad.
4
The menu is not extensive but they do offer a reasonable range of choice. I ate here twice when I wanted to sit in the open air, near the pool and have a lighter meal. Service was very good and the food was also very good
4
Restaurant within the Hyatt pool area. Tables inside and up to the waters edge if you want them. Note no air cond in this restaurant but inside there are fans to keep you cool...overall food was good with some local dishes as well as western barbecue. Service is superb nothing too much trouble. For eating outside and just enjoying a quiet dinner this is a good choice. All you can eat and drink buffet at weekends - a la carte other times
4
Tried here on my last night at the Grand Hyatt, attracted by the idea of sitting out on an evening and enjoying the relatively cool atmosphere.The food was good, service very quick and efficient the best that I have experienced in the three restaurants on site It is well worth the try and enjoy
5
I was recommended by a friend to come to Oasis for the Free Flow BBQ Buffet whilst my parents were visiting and I'm so glad we went, it was fantastic! Service great - lovely waitress constantly filled up our glasses with Prosecco, food was absolutely delicious with lots of variety to please everyone. It certainly was 'all you can eat'! The setting is lovely, we requested a table outside by the pool when booking and this was what we got - I'd definitely recommend this choice. It is good value in Singapore for what you get and I actually preferred it to a brunch. Can't wait to come back again
5
Just about anything you could desire if available at the breakfast buffet, including quail eggs!!!! the service is first rate
5
The pace up on the fifth floor of Grand Hyatt Singapore is a little more mellow and relaxed, the staff are great, friendly and fast. The food is wonderful. Try the house special rose wine and the Mee Goreng... A great combination.
4
I had made this booking calling from the UK, and it did not disappoint. The staff were very accommodating, considering I had 15 people in the group from UK/Australia/Germany/Singapore, and they gave us a long table near the pool. It was quite dark, which we made a comment about, and they brought 'egg-lights' which made the atmosphere more cosy. The price for the buffet and drinks was S$98/person, which I thought was pricey, but went along with it as it catered for my whole group. However, this cost was met mostly by the alcohol we drank (plus the food). The buffet was alright - steak was a little tough, and there were very few pieces to choose from - the pieces left on the grill were quite burnt, and there did not seem to be a chef around there to ask, as he seemed busy making drinks on the other end (we did try to get his attention for a few mins, but after 5 mins of standing there, we decided not to wait any longer). Those pieces were still there at the end of the night, without us noticing any new slices coming out! Otherwise, the duck was lovely and tender, and the prawns were big, but the oysters were not completely fresh (they had a strange smell to it!). Having said that, my group was happy with the salad/vegetable options (there was 1 vegetarian), which were very tasty. The ice cream and dessert were lovely too, so that was a bonus. All in all, my group had a lovely time at Oasis. They enjoyed the salad, dessert and alcohol. Point of note to management - you have fantastic staff. However, it would be good if your chefs appreciate that chargrilled does not equal burnt, to the point where there is more black on the meat/it is tough to eat! It will be good to refresh meat if it is not taken in that hour on the tray
5
Very nice evening, setting and attentive staff. We opted for the "all you can eat" BBQ with free flow of drinks. Nice margaritas and Valdobiadene prosecco. We haven't tasted the wine. Food was fresh and tasty. Particularly good oysters with all sauces and crispy duck with wafer thin pancakes. Very nicely grilled asparagus and selection of greens, but may not be the best option for vegans. Altogether good value. Guests- mostly expats and young expats/students celebrating. The only minus is the toilet section. They are arranged for the pool visitors, shower and toilet with frosted glass windows. Unless you lock the entire toilet from inside you can expect tipsy gentlemen knocking on the glass door and trying to be funny. I suggest enjoy the dinner but opt for another toilet in this lovely hotel
5
the market fish was perfectly cooked as was the steak. Thank you for being so accommodating to my little monkey of a toddler - as usual, your service was friendly and prompt.
5
We had a lovely family meal at Oasis on christmas eve. The service was great and all of the staff were helpful and friendly. The buffet selection was great - excellent bbq and salads plus fresh seafood. Nice aspect looking over the pool and gardens.
4
Did not go for the BBQ buffet, we normally drop by for lunch. The menu is limited but the staff are very attentive and friendly. The food is also always of a high quality. We'll definitely be back
3
We went to the Friday BBQ buffet recently, it was my first visit here for several years and this was previously my favourite eating spot with free flow beer and wine.I found that the quality and quantity of the food had dropped. For example, there was little sea food and the chef carved up steaks into slices which were presented to rather than giving you a whole steak.Small things but all put together they amount to a drop in standards
5
Gorgeous space for a drink by the pool or a more substantial meal. Was very happy with my bbq prawns and salad. Biggest prawns I've seen! Good variety of food and drinks (cocktails included). It was a shame we weren't around for dinner but I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch experience 
4
For more reviews, visit my site at ms-skinnyfatOasis is a BBQ restaurant with an open bar, where chefs prepare meat and seafood selections a la minute on the open charcoal-fired grills. It's located on the 5th Level of the Terrace Wing, same level as Damai Spa, the gym and the pool.All you can eat appetisers, main courses and desserts with free flow of Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc, D'Arenbery 'The Footbolt' Shiraz, Tiger and Heineken beers, margaritas and soft drinks for S$88 per pax. Buffet is available on Fri and Sat nights while platters are served on other nights. We saw that it was very popular with large groups.A selection of the appetizers. The roasted sweet potatoes and tomato salad was delicious. From the grill, there were some hits and misses. The first couple of prawns that we had were juicy and succulent, however the later batches were burnt and dry. The fish and roast beef weren't to our liking as they overdone as well. The sausages and the pork ribs however were noteworthy and had me going back for seconds. Surprisingly good was the roast duck which came with a Peking duck sauce. Yummeh. Another part of the Hyatt is Listening project is to maintain their guests' health and well-being on the road. Their new menu offerings include fresh juices and smoothies, balanced portions and "create your own" options. We made our own fried brown rice with plenty of shredded cabbage and carrots, baby corn, mushrooms and some chili to taste. This was very addictive
