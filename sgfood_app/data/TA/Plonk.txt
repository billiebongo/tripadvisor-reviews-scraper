The atmosphere was nice, fancy. No aircon just fan. Service was efficient. Large choice of dishes well cooked and nice presentations. Large choice of drink also

The food is generally above average. A nice assortment for the kids menu as well. Decent sized pizza and pasta.

Went with a girlfriend for drinks and light bite; perfect spot to get drunk in slippers since it is near home. Food is decent too and service is adequate.

The white wine was off, the steak was such a poor quality cut of meat it wasn√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t worth eating but the the lack of respect for food allergies was off the charts. I ordered a steak without garlic due to an allergy and the meal was brought to me twice, covered in garlic. Take your business elsewhere as plonk has nothing good to offer.

Had lunch on a Saturday afternoon and there was just a small crowd of mainly Caucasians. There is actually a second level that I guess would be ideal for big groups. Food was okay but the service staff could have been more attentive considering it was not crowded

I hadn't been to plonk in some time and always liked it but my visit last night although pleasant and with good service was a little disappointing as the pizza and linguini dishes were cold on arrival.The place was busy and the food arrived in good time,just wasn't ho

Had went to this restaurant for birthday celebration, this restaurant is located in one of the shop houses in serangoon garden, easily accessible from chomp chomp. The waiter is friendly and topped up our water frequently. I have ordered a beef rendang and girlfriend ordered a risotto. Not really to my liking as the beef rendang is a bit spicy and I can't take spicy, but the risottos is nice, as well as all the other who ordered fish & chips, chicken....... Etc. Will definitely visit again to try on other main course, when we sing happy birthday for our friend, all the surrounding tables also help sing along. Highly recommended

First visit just moved to the area. Very smooth coffee not boiling hot, made just right. Had pancakes very reasonable price big serve freshly made. Real maple syrup on the side. Recommend eggs benedict just right not drowned in hollandaise sauce. Well done Plonk, we'll be back

Had a very good dinner at Plonk. Good tapa, excellent portion size, and very good for drinks. Second floor service was poor though as staff member disappeared after mains.
4
While the selection of wine is comparatively small, they are good! We enjoyed the tapas and dessert as much as the ambience and music.
3
Food was good and a decent serve size for tapas, wine was good. Easy place to visit but nothing to rush back for.
4
Fantastic meal with the family here tonight, tapas were amazing, chicken risotto with pumpkin and feta was amazing, staff were also friendly and helpful, can't wait to go back on the weekend to try breakfast.
5
Food was good! Atmosphere was great too. Staff was attentive but seems to be short handed. Overall great experience for our first visit.

My family and I recently dined at Plonk on a Sunday evening to celebrate a birthday. Plonk occupies a shophouse along Maju Avenue, just after the My Village mall and next to Happy Daze.This is a casual Australian-style bistro that serves bistro fare and tapas like pizzas, pastas, salads, tapas, burgers and mains. Amongst the dishes that we ordered, we had the fish and chips, truffle risotto, wagyu burger and the chicken parmigiana. The food was definitely of a good standard and service was attentive and prompt.On a Sunday evening, the restaurant appeared to be about 60% filled, with the ground floor full and we were given a table on the upper level. No issues for us as this was air conditioned and cosy. All in all, this was a nice neighbourhood dining establishment serving good hearty Australian fare and a selected range of alcohol

This restaurant was reccomended to us by our friend. We order pizzas, Few small plates(prawns,haloumi,chorizo) and pasta seafood for sharing. The food are really tasty and so unique, the tuna pizza is d'best(thin crusted). very good price of wine as well with a range of $50 a btl. try the sticky date pudding dessert as well yum-yum....The Service is also a Top Notch. Service staffs are very helpful,smilling service and well trained. This is not our last visit here for sure..excellent.

Had a nice cosy dinner on a Sunday evening with friends. Wasn't too crowded or noisy, we were given a seat at the corner. My only gripe was that the wait staff weren't extremely attentive and it took quite some time each round to catch their attention even to get our orders taken
1
It must have been an off night based on previous reviews. We ordered three Tapa's. Mushroom bruschetta, Soft shell crab taco and Coconut/lemongrass prawns. The bruschetta was okay and tasty although the bread base was soft from the sauce base - needed toasting. The crab taco was exceptionally disappointing...oily and greasy with a rather strong tasting crab, so to the coconut prawns, dry and tasteless. This was followed by a prawn gourmet pizza. The base was good, topping looked okay but seriously wan, tasteless and undercooked. Had two drinks each, both cold and fine. We will not be back. Overall on reflection this has to be one of our worst food experiences in Singapore

Had dinner with our family of four on a fairly quiet Saturday night. Staff was friendly and attentive. We ordered 7 tapas for 2 adults. We were going to order more but the waiter suggested 7 would be enough and he was right. That sort of advice is always appreciated. Kids had a pizza each. They were very good and in fact I want to go back to try their gourmet pizzas. I would describe the menu as pan-European with tapas, pizza & pasta and fish & chips, lamb shank etc on main course. Nice selection of wines and microbrews which you can also buy to take home. This was our second visit and as we move to Serangoon Gdn we will for sure become regulars at Plonk

Location relatively easy to find. Pretty chill out place for a nice bottle of wine and good food. Service is attentive . Will definately return again üëç
4
Love the tapas and the selection of beers. You can mix different selection of beers to be served in a bucket.
4
They let us bring our dog here, the food is really good, so is the service. It's an easy walk for us which makes it worth going to often.

I had a pleasant experience at Plonk! Service staff were all very friendly and attentive. Food was also served very quickly and all of them came at once. Tried the 6 tapas platter, roasted chicken risotto, Barcelona pizza, and seafood aglio olio and all of them were pretty good. Only drawback was that they did not allow us to have the birthday cake that we brought to celebrate my father's birthday. For having a birthday cake at their premises, it is chargeable at $20 which we thought was too expensive
5
Dropped in here for birthday dinner and was very impressed. The Chicken Parm was amazing on top of shoestring fries alongside a Plonk Salad. Very tasty. Relaxing music and wonderful open air entrance leading into a buzzing street. Well done to the owners! And the chef and serving staff

Been here a couple of times and I got to say it's really a good place to dine, wine and chill. The place doesn't get overly crowded so it's really nice to hold conversations with ur love ones.tapas is delicious . Love the mushroom bruschetta especially. Sadly my fav wine is out of the list. Will be back for sure again . Cheer

We regularly go to Plonk on a weekend for a meal, and always love the atmosphere, food and staff. It's not super cheap, but they do have a good menu, and we have never yet been let down. Alcohol , especially wine is unfortunately quite expensive.
5
I think this place could fast become my fave place to go because it's one of those bars/restaurants where I feel so comfortable that I don't want to leave. I have been for dinner twice now, yet to try for lunch or brunch but I noticed they had a decent looking brunch menu. There's no fancy decor - it's a bit hodge-podge with artwork scattered on the walls, exposed brickwork, wine and beer on display (to purchase), really friendly staff and good service, good choices on the menu (our meals have been lovely each time), great wine, comfortable seating upstairs and downstairs and a really good vibe. Go there, you'll like it.

Went to the restaurant just before Chinese New Year. This place has lots of tables. There is a great selection of meals including tapas. I had halumi with watermelon and pate. Both were delish. The wine list is very good and reasonable prices. I would definitely go back there again
3
All is fine till the cancerous campfire marshmallow for kiddo came. It tasted butter-burnt with chemical-torch in the chocolate dip as well.Feed back was NOT well-received as the cashier claimed it's their best-seller. Not worth the time
5
What a lovely place to hang out, a friendly vibe with good food and cozy atmosphere. There is a lovely play area for children upstairs and the staff are helpful and very polite
Keep up the good work and we look forward to coming back
4
Had business lunch there, quiet atmosphere allowing good discussion. Set lunch was perfect and well priced at 17SGD including starter meal + espresso.. Too bad that tapas are only available for dinner, I guess I'll have to go back to taste them
5
We got here to celebrate my friends' wedding anniversary and besides the good company, must say that the food we had (tapas platter) was pretty decent. Would definitely be back again to try the foods from the rest of the menu.
5
the food is incredible i brought my family there for a quick meal and ended up staying for OVER TWO HOURS. with the great service of the their waiters mark and eric. and wonderful food coked by chefs lennon and jules.
5
Great little place in Maju Ave at Serangoon Gardens. Excellent breakfast menu with great coffee barista service.
5
I was impressed by the whole experience. My lamb t-bone with pumpkin feta was perfect, and my friends' dishes--Chilean sea bass and rib eye steak--were equally delicious. The service was excellent also. Our dessert of sticky date pudding with honey ice cream was original and perfect for the palate. Our waiter appeared at the perfect times, cognizant of our needs without hovering, and he was able to answer every question I had about the menu or ingredients. I would definitely eat here again

Drove by and spotted this new place, decided to try it out. Dinner time and we had chicken dish and pasta, love the concept of the over sized menu that featured the daily specials and shortly, went back again for brunch. Food snd coffee is good, slightly too expensive due to small portion. What made it 3 star rating is because it is TOO WARM, close the windows and turn up the a/c please. Humidity in this country is not great with open windows.
4
In summary: great food and service. Not close to where we live but will travel here again and take friends. Upstairs, downstairs and outside space, this restaurant offers a great brunch menu. Tucked away in Maju this is a hidden gem. Would recommend Eggs Royale and the Corn Fritters, both excellent and attentive service with a smile!
5
What a blast! We had a large group and the staff provided a fun and informal meal. The chef was full-on knowlegeable about gluten free food options and provided a great grill + seafood option for me. The name Plonk is funny - and the service was great

Came for an evening drink after dinner on a Saturday. Sat on an outside bench watching the slow but still bright neighbourhood. Very relaxing, unpretentious atmosphere with good service. Read in their menus that the chef came from Jules which was super good. Definitely coming back for a meal
