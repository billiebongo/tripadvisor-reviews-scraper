Always nice to find a decent coffee spot in another country, sometimes it is so hard! The shot was a little bit underextracted, but even so the coffee was very tasty and still the best I had in Singapore!

Came back here today this time for lunch. I opted for the smoked salmon bagel which came with a small side salad. Really quite tasty. Efficient and friendly service. Not too busy at lunchtime. Worth another visit.

Excellent coffee and desserts. Definitely worth an afternoon. The only problem is the desserts are soooo rich you will want to nap afterwards!

This place is very quiet for a cafe. Came for lunch and is able to spend some quiet moments here alone.They have lunch set here, selling some sandwiches and burgers. I tried the teriyaki chicken sandwich. The bread seems abit too toasted, but overall, with the teriyaki chicken and vege, it tastes good. Just feels that the teriyaki chicken is too small portion. I thought I saw the menu indicating "generous portion" but thr portion of meat did not meet my expectations.The latte top-up was additional $2 to the lunch set, so I decided to try their coffee as well. It has a unique taste, which I kind of like it. They have dulce sugar on the table, which is interesting.The staff is friendly and accomodating. Can see they use heart to make a cup of coffee for you. Love the coffee art too.Will definitely be back to try their burger and other coffee on the menu

The seasalt caramel latte is popular here. It's a cozy little hideout, it does not only have your quick and easy cafe food but also there's a chirashi/jap food pop-up store within it. It's called Boru Boru. It's like having the best of both worlds, coffee and chirashi. Oh and right inside you have a manicure place too! Interesting place

Came back here again for a second visit yesterday with a colleague. We both opted for a cappuccino which was served at the right temperature with some pretty art on top. Decent multi-origin coffee and efficient service. Not too busy even during the busy Friday lunch period

Best sea salt caramel I've ever had. They make the caramel in house; always a good sign. Next stop: Melbourne to get it from the source - Dukes Coffee Roasters. Loved this place and staff were great. Came back a second time the next day and had the chicken teriyaki: love it. My wife had the ham and cheese and a flat white - both were delicious.
