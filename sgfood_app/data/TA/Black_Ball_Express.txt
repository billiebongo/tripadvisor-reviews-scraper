My sis loves their desserts so much and always ask to visit them whenever she pops by Punggol to visit me. Located conveniently in Punggol Waterway Point.

Went there to try it once. Kept going back for more. They serve Taiwanese desserts that are really delicious and Refreshing. Price could be a bit lower but overall still not bad

This dessert stall serves Taiwanese style desserts, with the Grass Jelly as their signature dessert. There are standardized mixes or you could design your own dessert. Pretty cool. The taste is okay and not too sweet.

Selection and price are okay but the management need to allocate more manpower especially after dinner. Almost everyday there's only 1 employee and doing all the job from ordering and preparing food. It's so pity to watch the employee alone whereas the opposite competitor (Koi) have more than 5 employees. So yah if you dont mind waiting around 15-20 mins then it's a good dessert to take considering the hot weather of Singapore

Just when you thought deserts are for quick and fast, this one serves fast but still there is a queue of 7 orders before us. Yes we were served within 28 mins but this queue NEVER ends, immediately after us, there is another queue set up for at least 5 more behind me...Singaporeans love desert
