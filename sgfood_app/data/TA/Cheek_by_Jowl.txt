The food is truly amazing. We went for the 3 course a la carts and enjoyed every mouthful. The wine was a little pricey but that seems to be the norm in restaurants these days. Will definitely return.
4
Service was great. The food tends to be packed full of flavors - might be a little too strong for some. The quail is our favorite!
5
Had a wonderful dinner with my wife. The staff are friendly and attentive. The food is excellent. Certainly will come back again.

Truing this place for the first time. Went for the 3 course meal. The wait staff was patient and friendly to introduced the 2/3/5 course and also took care to ask for any diet restrictions. We decided on 2 starts and a mains: oysters, fish - starts and steak (medium rare) for mains. Everything was well presented and tasted well. The restaurant gave us olives, grilled small green chilli peppers and a bread with cheese dips as finger food before serving the meal. It was really nice because the olives and grilled green chilli reminded me of my recent trip to Spain end of 2017. The restaurant had a casual and comfortable setting and ambience, even had counter seats with a view of the kitchen. Its a place I would like to come back again

Booked dinner for friend birthday celebration. Ambience relax and casual. Staff service was great. We took the 5 course Tasting menu but seem like 8 Course lol. Overall, the food was good and filling, but interval was a bit long. For a S$88 tasting dinner menu, worth it
5
Was a lovely experience all the way through from booking to billing. Atmosphere was ideal for a business lunch, menu had a variety of choice. Food was farm fresh and served very timely. Staff were welcoming and educated on the menu. Would definitely recommend this restaurant and will be visiting again soon
5
Absolutely excellent experience have already booked next week with friends ! Amazing food , great relaxed service and atmosphere , wonderful taste , combinations and presentation . Seldom I have seen such an efficient and well managed kitchen - Chef and Wife you so deserve +5 stars !
5
This restaurant has very minimalistic decor that shows the kitchen . You can spot the cuisiniers in action and cooking. A little like a tv show. The food is very delicious. Enjoyed the barramundi . Very crispy and moist flesh . Delicate cooking. I also enjoyed the wine here , service was superb . Enjoyed my time without being asked alot of questions as a single person. Merci , will be back 
5
We managed to get a couple of seats t the counter with only 2 days notice. We were lucky and I would definitely suggest booking in advance....We have the tasting menu and had a couple of hours of some amazing food. Flavours and presentation were excellent. I'd highly recommend a visit here and I will be back on my next trip to Singapore. My husband actually enjoyed it so much he took corporate clients here twice more during the following week
5
We did the 5 course set menu. The food is very good. Presentation is good and each taste had that wow or “really yummy” aspect to it. The variety of ingredients and textures is also terrific. The service is good to very good. It’s a nice little place and although fully occupied the sound inside wasn’t deafening as so many other similar sized places are. We will definitely be back. It was a great meal and excellent value given the quality of the food.
5
The food was great, could ask for more. The service was also excellent. Those snacks served in between of main courses are nice. It is very thoughtful of the chef to arrange something in between. Overall dining experience is perfect. I will definitely go back.
5
Yum yum ! Love the buzz of the restaurant. Delicious meal . Had the barramundi , yoghurt dessert. Spot on . Great energy
5
Great food, wine and service!!! Really outstanding experience from beginning to end! Could not recommend it anymore, would definitely go back! Impeccable flavors, innovative use of ingredients, five star service and well earned Michelin Star!
4
The food was really good, well presented and expertly prepared.
Staff was friendly and the atmosphere ‘smart casual’.
The menu was reasonably priced and - given the quality - offers a great value.
Would happily go there again.
5
Every time I go to this place I walk out happy. The quality of the food is stunning. The presentation and the mix of textures is sublime. Clearly one of the best restaurants in Singapore. Fantastic food, very friendly staff and a casual ambiente.

Been here several times and the set lunch price is the same but 1 course has been removed. They have also removed the raw beef salad from the set lunch menu and told me its only available in the dinner menu. Kinda disappointed with the choice of mains in the menu. Apart from the seabass, one of the other choices was vegetarian. For steak, there would be an additional charge. On the plus side, the pre-starters of home mase bread and olives waa good.
4
This is such a cool modern Australian resturant .The chief has taken parts of animal that are less eaten and have turned them into fabulous dishes . It’s very fresh and creative and judging by the difficulty in reserving a table this resturant has found its sweet spot

Been there for a business lunch with a prior reservation and request of a Vegan lunch menu.Upon arriving the hostess asked me for my name to check my reservation and told me that my guest was already seated in the restaurant and pin pointed in the direction of the table, but when I got there the person sitting there was not my guest. After going back to the hostess and telling her that this is not my guest she had to check with 2 other people and myself once again if I am sure about the person sitting there not being my guest??!! And I was left in the middle of the restaurant to figure out which one the correct table could be??!! Once ready to order my guest asked for the Vegan choice as requested while making the reservation. But was just told by the waitress that all the choices are on the menu and the chef can just take whatever he does not want to eat of the plate... :( !! We both were a bit shocked to hear that in a restaurant like that to say the least. Even after asking if the Chef might be able to come up with a menu on the spot, NO further efforts have been made to accommodate us by the waitress which did not even check with the chef and just kept repeating what she said before....Food: good but not memorableService: way below expectations...will not come bac
5
I came upon Cheek by Jowl both before and after it got its Michelin Star. Service is excellent and what can I say about the food? Superb. I went for a farewell with work colleagues, and even the most difficult to please local was impressed. We went for lunch, which is great value. Try the barramundi, that’s what I go for, the steak is also good.
5
Three of us went there for a 3 course lunch and were not disappointed in any way. The venison starter was sublime as was the artichoke dish. we all had sea bass for the main which was perfectly cooked and the burnt pear dessert and the cherry dessert were excellent. The table service was superb with an explanation given of all of the dishes as they were served at the table. The wine list is extensive but you will definitely find something to your liking to wash the food down with. It's not cheap to eat here but you certainly get value as a result of great service, great food and great wine. I would definitely come back here anytime
4
This is my second visit to this restaurant. *For majority of the dishes on the menu, it is a worth a stop to this restaurant, while a minor few may require some rethinking or tweaks.
5
Australian theme and very thoughtful and beautifully presented food.
An amazing artichoke dish also imaginative cooking of farmed Barramunddi.
Blackberry ice cream.
5
Absolutely excellent, great service , fantastic food , wonderful taste and details ,great wine recommendation , will definitely come back !
5
We took Singaporean friends to dinner & all 4 of us loved every plate which we shared. Great service & atmosphere! Made our trip to Singapore very memorable. We will be back.
5
Food was served in nice shape and smell, and most importantly outstanding tastes. Amazing vibe for a Saturday lunch, appeal to both western and Asian customers. Location is easy to find as well.
4
Four of us had a lovely 5-course meal with our own bottle. The resturant is small and intermide. Service is professional and attentive. However parking is a real challenge at weekend nights. With corkage, the final bill was about S$118 per head, real great value for money. The dishes are a treat to both the palette and the eyes. The 5 course meal includes 5 complimentary and innovative snacks and sides. You would not fill over stuffed, as the portion size is appropriate. Highly recommend 
5
We brought two friends for dinner. The only negative for the whole evening was the loud music which was turned down a bit at our request. At S$ 88 for the 5-course tasting menu plus 3 amuse bouche is some of the best value in Town. The fish, quail, fish, and lamb we absolutely delicious, and so were the amuse bouche. The service was very good, and the staff competent, without overdoing it.Highly recommended, booking essential
5
We were so lucky some ex-pat friends of ours organised dinner in this incredible restaurant. They secured the 4 seats at the kitchen bar and we were treated to a truly amazing meal. We chose the chefs 5 course selection option and experienced what seemed like 10 or 11 different amazing courses. The cheese bread, the liquorice cake dessert, the incredible liver pate cigar....every item was a winner. Too hard to choose a favourite. The service was also next level with the chef and maitre'd both taking time to talk to us and explain the menu. Always great to watch a kitchen in action an this one hums like a well oiled machine. No drama, just a small kitchen brigade delivering outstanding food
5
Tried this as it got a michelin star. I can see the appeal - SGD88 for 5 course omakase , add 3 amuse bouche and 2 snacks before the main. And the 5 courses are pretty sunstantial - fish, quail, fish, lamb , dessert. Unlike some other establishments with more fluffy dishesHence it was packed when i arrived at 9pm and there were still guests when we left at midnight. The place is pretty small so book way ahead to get a tableFood is good, not wow. Ditto for service4 stars for food/service. 5 stars for valu

The well deserved award of a Michelin Star has done nothing to dampen the quality or warmth of Cheek by Jowl.It is of course busier , as it should be, but go at lunch time if you can't get an evening reservation.Chef Rishi Naleendra is on the top of his game producing innovative dishes using fresh ingredients and mixing Asia and international flavours.It is hard to describe how innovative the menu is - it changes frequently and so I keep going back.Manuela keeps the wine list interesting with various organics and interesting grape varieties -if you don't know what to order, leave it to her and you will not be disappointed.She also keeps the service at a consistently high level especially given that it is always full ! If you are a foodie then visit - I guarantee you will leave satiated in ind and body !
5
We had business lunch at Cheek by Jowl and it was excellent the service was friendly and the food perfect,presentation, flavor !!!! the price lunch time is a great value and I will with no hesitation go back for an other great meal.
5
the customer service was really good! the food portion is a lot for fine dining. our favourite was the oyster :)
5
Finally came down here and totally satisfied with the food and drink! Can't complain much! We'll visit again for sure!
4
A nice, pleasant place with excellent service. The Chef-owner and his wife take personal care and attention and the regular wait staff are also very competent, efficient and friendly. A small selection for the a la carte , with the chef suggesting he prefers it when diners order the tasting menu as that allows him to show his creativity. The food is good, but nothing really distinctive from the many other high quality restaurants that have sprung up all over the city offering so-called 'modern' takes on various cuisines. However reasonable prices and the excellent service will certainly have people coming back regularl
5
This is a Modern Australian with a twist of fun and creativity. We enjoyed the Chef Courses and the service was wonderful. We were treated to a very consistent quality of amazing treats served in adequate portions. We left on a high note and promised our wonderful hosts a returned trip
5
It's my boyfriend's birthday and he's been very keen in visiting Cheek by Jowl since they first launched. My boyfriend and I simply loved the service and food! Only thing I would feedback is the air ventilation, as the kitchen and the floor are open concept, so I could constantly smell the oil coming from the kitchen. Other than that, great
5
Beautiful dinner. Tried the 5-course Chef's Tasting and it was worth it. Lots of surprising combination of ingredients, but really glad they work. The appetizers are all well-seasoned, refreshing, and balanced. The meats are all cooked to perfection, and the dessert (hay panna cotta) was one of the best I've eaten this year (you'll especially love it if you don't like heavy desserts).Chef Rishi was really friendly and he was not hesitant to engage with me when I asked him questions with regard to the unique ingredients and methodology he used. It was a pleasure to directly see him commanding the kitchen. His wife, Manuela, is also very attentive and she always try to make sure that you enjoy your time in their restaurant. Overall, it was a pleasure dining there and I would not hesitate to come back again and again. (Don't forget to try their cocktails since they are damn good
5
This restaurant was recently awarded a Michelin star. Chef Rishi deserves it - the dishes are interesting , Flavours blend well , it's not too heavy as portions are just the right size and tasty.The menu offers 2,3 or 5 courses. The 5 course menu is effectively the tasting menu and it's realValue for money at $88++. Rishi has stayed true to his passion for good Creative dishes and the Michelin star hasn't led toPrices increasing .With the tasting menu, we go some delightful starters - finger food to whet our appetite. We had also informed the staff what items each of us avoided and the replacements were very satisfactory.The quails eggs , quail meat , lamb , suckling pig, smoked makeral, barramundi were expertly prepared with accompanying garnishes and sauces - the nice thing was that even though it's quite a few dishes , you do not feel overly heavy. The honeydew with mascarpone was a lovely end to the meal.Service is very good ,attentive , friendly and accommodating . Each item is described and if you don't hear it first time,ask again because it's important you appreciate what you are about to Savour. Manager Manuela is on hand to explain and supervise to ensure all goesSmoothly.Chef Rishi was available to chat with us and share his passion. We even took a photo with him.Definitely worth another visit , and I am sure Chef Rishi will create new items as he has a passion and the enthusiasm to keepImproving 
5
overall, a very good experiencei took the chef tasting menu. i found the food sizes were very small. I took them in one bite and wanted to ask for more. It tasted so good.Surprisingly with those small sizes, i was full after dessert. The staff is great
5
Visited this place for my Bday dinner along with my husband. It was meant to be a surprise and I can't be happier with his choice. The place was buzzing and warm. The food was absolutely fantastic. We tried the 5 course meal which was completely designed by the chef based on our preferences. The presentation, the flavors and the different textures really made this a fabulous experience. Would highly recommend!
5
Visited for lunch. Two things great about this place
1. Delicious dishes at reasonable price
2. Very good service and staff
I had smoked mackerel,barramundi and honey dew which was quite a treat for the taste buds!
5
Food was delicious. Highlights of the meal are the quail and the barramundi, which I could eat for every single meal! Be careful while eating the deceptive egg, I burst it and yolk went flying everywhere. Not cool.
4
Lunch menu is great value. The burnt pear desert is amazing. Friendly staff and fantastic open kitchen!
5
This is really one of my top favourites to celebrate a special occasion. The food was insanely delicious and very well executed. The ambience was warm and the crowd was not too deafening. Perfect for special/romantic moments.
5
We had an amazing team, staff really friendly and helpful, food was delicious! Do not miss the raw beef salad.
5
Visited before they received the Michelin star. Was a wonderful evening with each dish a delight to the palate. A pity we couldn't eat more than our stomachs could fit. Though the monkfish arrived slightly undercooked, they apologised and fixed the dish immediately. Dessert was a blast. Even months after the visit, I still look forward to dining here again

Geez Michelin what are you doing to rate this nice and imaginative little restaurant a one star?Cheek by Jowl is a nice little bistro style restaurant run by a Husband and Wife team who do a good job. Him cooking, her front of house. The food was nice but not wow factor, the restaurant ambience was not great, a bit cheap and cheerful, the prices were expensive particularly for the wine (problem in general in Singapore).I think it's not great for this restaurant to be awarded or accept a star- it leads to expectations from the general public that if not fulfilled lead to disappointment and reviews like this
4
Food is pretty good. I like the charred taste on the vegetables.May be an issue if you have a big group as they require deposit upfront for 8 pax n above and was told that if one doesn't turn up last min, they have to charge 8 still! Doesn't sounds too customer service oriented, as I thought this can be better managed.
5
Been wanting to try this for a long time and didn't knew that they were a Michelin awarded restaurant. The service was good, the waiters even told you what you were eating before every dish. The only down side is that they will usually want you to take your course according to the sequence
5
Not sure what I can say but we loved Cheek by Jowl. Food and wine is very personal. For us our night was a stand out. If you love tasting good food and wine, like an intimate restaurant and like down to earth people who work incredibly hard to present all of this then go. You won't be disappointed
5
from the friendly welcome to the bread, the amuse bouche, the starter, the main course, dessert: absolutely perfect.
5
Wonderful food experience at very generous prices. We did the 3 course a la carte and fully enjoyed every dish.
5
Great food, positive energy and fantastic food service even during the peaked hours. The meals were well portioned and the food quality was good even when it's packed with the lunch crowd.
Looking forward to my next one. Hopefully it's dinner this round.
5
got 5 course set lunch for 58 and quite worth it. fave is the complimentary oyster! ordered another 2 ;)
5
Had the 5 course chef's menu. Wonderful meal, from snacks down to the dessert. Loved the barramundi and the cheese bread.
5
Its no wonder how such a young establishment earned it's first Michelin Star. Everything from start to finish was on point..
4
This place have nice ambience together with good service.
Food is good too.
Recommend to come and try if you are around here.

We went for the three course set lunch ($46++)Starters were the smoked arctic char, and beetroot with feta cheese. Both dishes were excellent - light but flavourful and well-executed. For the mains, we had the roast pumpkin and barramundi. I didn't enjoy the barramundi - it was well-cooked and all, but had this inexplicable...slimy texture? that didn't quite sit well with me. The fermented carrot broth was rather oily as well. I thought the roast pumpkin was the clear winner - the kale boasted a strong "wok-hei" from being sautéed in high heat; the spiced cashew nut was addictive on its own and provided a nice crunch to the overall texture of the dish; and the pumpkin was roasted to perfection. If I had any gripes with the dish, it would be that the pumpkin wasn't sweet enough. The dessert (coconut semi-freddo with laksa ice cream) divided us: my partner liked it, but I didn't. I thought the flavours were weird, and didn't quite gel together. He thought it was an interesting and refreshing take on dessert. In all - decent meal. Not sure quite if it warrants the hype, but still worth a visit.
5
Cheek by Jowl - For sure, one of the best restaurants we have been to in 2017. This Husband-and-Wife operated bistro serves modern Australian fare. We were presented with a short but adequate menu, and both of us chose the 3-course dinner. The small quantity of bread that came with butter in purée form, and the accompanying olives, gave us a sneak preview of the quality of food that was to come. Our starters of roasted quail and raw beef salad were excellent; the main courses of suckling pig and barramundi were sublime; our desserts of burnt pear and coconut ice cream were a worthy finale. All in, it was clear why this restaurant has the accolade of one Michelin star.
4
Our 4th Michelin restaurant over the past month. Food was interesting in variety and taste. I liked the snacks. The starter course was fresh and a great combination of flavours. The quail, barramudi and kangaroo loin were good. The dessert was actually a nice surprise. Their service is good though it can be better. There was good explanation of the dish and liked a lot their suggestion on how to eat the dish.
5
Superior combinations, great taste foods, excellent services, relax dinning mood and you will love come back for more.
5
Excellent food, great location, nice Australian fusion cuisingreat service, highly recommend the 'house' Pinot Noir too!
5
Each the dishes were thoughtfully paired in terms of ingredients and everything(!) tasted excellent!
We had:
Oyster Smoked Tomato
Roasted Quail with chestnut, mushroom, mint
Salt Baked Beetroot with goats cheese, pickled raisins, horseradish
Barramundi with fermented carrot broth, pslane and white dandelion
Duck Confit
4
The barramundi offered as part of set lunch was awesome! I'm never into fish, neither was I into beef cheek which was the other meat option for main course . I chose the fish since well, I don't have much alternatives and this proved a wise choice. The skin was crisp and meat was fresh. As for starters, the quail won hands down as compared to the char.
5
Was here with my bffs for lunch. Despite these dear ladies' dietary constraints, the Chef still managed to satisfy all of us. Everything tasted good but the most memorable were the hard bread rolls with housemade cheese and the laksa leaf ice cream. Will be back with other friends
5
What a combo - Chef Rishi, and Manuela running front of house.Billed as modern Australian, both lunch and dinner menus show an incredible fusion of Asia and the Pacific- all matched with interesting wines.Seriously good meats as you might expect, but served with fascinating accompaniments - and the fries are superb.There is also a great cheese selection - if you can fit it in.Roshida and Manuela have just been awarded a Michelin star which is well deserved.The ambience is more bistro, with an open kitchen , which gives it a relaxed feel mixed with the buzz from the kitchen.Lunch is an amazing 58 dollars for 5 courses ! Dinner is still good value for the quality at $88 for 5 courses.Great hosts, superb food - why wouldn't you ?

Entrees were excellent! 1. Smoked artic char (5/5)2. Roasted quail (5/5)The beef cheeks (main) however was sub par. There was no balance to the dish. Acidity was not present to cut the richness of the dish. Unwhelming(2.5/5)Barramundi was good.(3.5/5)Burnt pear was alright. (3/5

@TheKuoKnowsI had the good fortune of trying Cheek By Jowl before it was awarded a Michelin star. At that time, it was easy to get a table. But not now!I have to say I was very impressed with the food. Everything was top drawer. The Raw Beef Salad was exquisite. Lots of flavour. Oodles of contrasting ingredients. Bags of colour.The Pan Fried Baramundi was top of the shop. Cheek by Jowl has turned the humble Asian sea bass into a work of art.For the budget-conscious, the lunchtime fare is affordable. But like many Singapore restaurants, prices tend to go up at dinner time.This is one place that I have put on my speed-dial. The food is expertly prepared. The ambience is second to none. And the waiting staff know the menu inside out
5
Visited Cheek by Jowl on 07 Jul 2017. I had my Lunch Menu set. Appetizer of Roasted Quail was cook to perfection. I chose the Barramundi as main course which was also the signature of Cheek by Jowl, the fish was crispy on the outside and moist inside. perfect culinary skill. The desserts of Coconut is simply unique. love the laksa leaf ice cream. would be back anytime soon. well deserved 1 michelin star
5
The cooking at this establishment is both singular and inspiring. A student of Chef Tetsuya Wakuda, the chef brings a stunningly beautiful approach to his cuisine that is totally unique to Singapore. Most impressively are his vegetable dishes as well as his unique spice work. The Chef's profound sense of minamalism and respect for ingredients culminate in what I can only describe as the best one Michelin starred restaurant in Singapore. The service is humble, sharp, thoughtful, and unobtrousive. There is an impressive but reasonably priced Australian wine list. I absoloutly love the place. Order the Pumpkin dish and prepare to never look at that vegetable the same way again. Utterly fantastic! Highly recommended
5
Gret experience overall. Staff were friendly and attentive. The food was spot on, hearty with interesting flavors.
5
What an astonishing and enjoyable assault on the senses. Every dish had the most beautiful flavours. We tried most dishes and all were extraordinarily tasty. Kangaroo loin was sublime. Service was first class - everyone clearly loves the food and delights in your enjoyment.
5
Enjoyed a lovely evening with friends the days after Cheek by Jowl had won its Michelin Star
Superb and top class service
Food was over all excellent, especially the Cheesy Bread, goats cheese with beetroot and raw beef appetisers.
Over all a lovely evening.
4
Having been to this excellent restaurant a few times now, is it time to change the menu? Some new dishes would be welcomed
5
Always enjoy the food and ambience here.... will always come back for more good food and great service :D
5
Wonderful experience. Food was sensational, delicious and creative. Being relatively new to the requirement of a strict gluten free diet I did not have to worry here. They went to great lengths to ensure that I was well catered for. There were gluten free options and a willingness to modify other choices. I really cant say enough about how well I was looked after. We will definitely be back and I recommend that you try this one out too.
5
Food was creative and delicious. The chef has a talent for combining flavors. The 5 course omakase set was very good value for money. The staff was friendly and helpful. Only remark was that it was a little noisy and hard to hear each other & food descriptions due to being seated under a speaker and the crowd. Would go back and would recommend others to go too
5
It's truly a shame this restaurant doesn't get more recognition for the quality of its cooking.The food here was bright and often enhanced by the addition of some acid/vinegar. I love the taste profile of all of the dishes we tried. Strong flavors with interesting ingredients, presentation and combinations that restored my faith in the western food dining scene in Singapore. It really feels like the chef here has something to say and in his own voice. Service was warm and efficient.Space is cozy
5
This is the best meal I've had this year. Reasonably small so book early. The food was fresh, delicious and different. A month later, I am still talking about the plum dessert. Don't know how they do it - somehow you get a multi layered taste sensation. And over time. Amazing. Like a B52. Or a Willi Wonka chocolate bar. Go.
5
Really surprising restaurant. Very casual style located on small 2 floor traditional house in Singapore, we were very surprised by the quality of the food and creativity for the taste and presentation.Keeping this casual style on the small wood table, the elegance of the food cooked with ingeniously gave to our evening a real wish to come back.Really you must discover this.In appetizer we recommended Oster!, salade and main course the lamb is nice as well ribeye. ( little bit disappointed by the duck)Desert was to strange taste!Thank for its warm welcome staff
5
Very good food. Nice ambience, polite staff. The fish also very fresh. Good job, keep it up. Good good good good good
5
Chefs take special care in explaining your menu for you and bar seats were amazing as they'll make you feel at home with the amazing service. Second time there and i will be back for more
5
Awesome food - the tasting menu is highly recommended.
The service was excellent!
My friend had a wonderful birthday dinner
5
The food was quite unique but it was absolutely perfect Austrian food with reasonable value.
Size of restaurant wad a bit small but it made us more comfortable and cozy!
4
Elegant sophisticated delicious food beautifully presented.
The complimentary cheese bread balls with cheese foam is divine.
5
One of the best experiences for lunch. Tasty well prepared food and a full house. Loved the beetroot and coconut sorbet! Will return and will also try for dinner.

My Boyfriend and I went to Cheek by Jowl on May 13th 17'. My mom recommended it to me after having seen a review of the restaurant online. We chose the 630PM - 830PM booking on a Saturday and were not too surprised that the place remained rather empty the entire time we were there. For that seating, there were 4 couples (including us) and 1 family having dinner. The place is in the heart of the CBD so we didn't think many would be heading down that way on a weekend. We ordered 2 drinks - a "Blood and Bone" and a "Spiced Apple Cider". Pretty good, but at $18 per glass, it's a little pricy. For food, we ordered: Appetisers - Cheese Bread, 2 Oysters, Raw Beef Salad Mains - Barramundi, Rangers Valley Red Eye Between us two, we went out stuffed without even having dessert. I'll definitely be back to try dessert next time! The cheese bread was great - soft, fluffy donut-like bread with silky, whiteComte cheese sauce on the side. I would recommend it for sharing. I don't usually enjoy oysters but my Boyfriend ordered 1 for me and 1 for him, and I thought, "what the heck!". So Glad I did - the oysters were fresh and the texture springy, and the smoked tomato on top was smoky and tart. Delicious!! The raw beef salad was insanely good. They deep fried the Brussels sprouts until crispy and mixed it in with the aged, raw wagyu. This to me was the highlight of the appetisers I tried! The Japanese flavors in this are so yummy. The barramundi was fresh, light and the perfect way for me to end the meal! It was cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection. The steak my Boyfriend ordered came with the most delicious Cafe de Paris sauce and thick, well seasoned triple cooked fries. My Boyfriend promptly gobbled the steak up - he was a very happy man afterward. Overall, a fantastic experience. The staff were attentive and service was quick. Opt to sit at the bar where you can watch the chefs hard at work!

Wow! I have travelled the globe sampling great food from amazing chefs and CBJ is a hidden gem. Chef Rishi and wife/restauranteur, Manuela(what a great pairing!) have created a mouthwatering (and innovative) culinary masterpiece! The fresh oysters topped w smoked tomato ice shavings wowed us and brought us back for a total of 3 visits in 4 days to sample the rest of the menu. We simply love the place. It is a foodie paradise and without a doubt, CBJ deserves at least a Michelin star!! A very authentic blend of different ingredients to create a flavorful and mouthfeel that is truly unique. Tip: do sample the organic wines that Manuela has compiled. Love the Jauma'Tikka the Cosmic Cat' Syrah Grenache blend and from the same vinyard but not on the menu a wonderful textured chenin blanc. Thank you Rishi/Manuela for a delightful culinary experience
5
Chef Rishi is a seriously talented Chef and front of house run by Manuela , his other half.Between them they host a relaxed restaurant but with superb food and a seriously interesting wine list.The tasting menu in the evening is wonderful and good value at 88 - this goes up if you want the steak (a huge rib) but quite frankly the other dishes are filling and delicious and we struggled to finish the steak.Rishi's mixture of flavour and textures is sublime - smoked mackerel with a crust made from bones was just stunning, as was the lamb tongue.For veggies there is a fabulous sweet pumpkin dish Desserts are also a delight using tropical flavours and pears and coconuts he conjures up gorgeous dishes.For a taster just go for the limited lunch menu - cheaper but the food is just as good
5
2nd visit this time . Both times I had the tasting menu, Chef decides , where you get to try almost everything they've got to offer . Which was great, cause Both visit after couple of months in between, it felt like I was surprised with a different and new dishes. Got to try from fish, oysters, kangaroo to veal .
4
Very tasty and well executed food which was also stunning to look at. Interesting wine selection devoid of big labels but of good quality and artisanal.
5
We had a delightfull tasting menu. All dishes were very good and the wine pairings likewise. Excellent service.
5
Food was fantastico, from appetizer to desserts was very delicious. Will come again in near future for sure.
5
Continues to be one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore. Chef Rishi's changing menu keeps me going back.
5
We had the tasting menu for 6 accommodating for dietary needs amongst the group and the food was nothing short of outstanding. Each course met and surpassed expectation.The staff were courteous and helpful and the wine list good.I would recommend this restaurant without reservation

Delightful dinner at Cheek, tried everything on the menu and everything was delicious, literally. Their vegetables dishes are amazing & somehow outshines the others (i hate vegetables, coming from me, it's something) I also know that they change menu very frequently, which is another major motivation for us to visit again.would definitely recommend to our friends

This is an odd place with a chef trying much too hard to make his dishes fancy and trendy.Miniscule portions adorned with a smear here or a foam there.At lunchtime there is not much choice and a quite simply weird drinks and wine list. Sadly not everything the chef thinks goes with something odd actually works.It is being odd for oddness sake rather rather a delicious taste.The place is noisy, the seats very uncomfortable and the service brusque. Better places with proper food and drink are to be found nearby.Swerve this one

Overrated! Food is so so only. Not worth the price paid. We ordered the beetroot, duck and fish. The beetroot wad one of the must-haves I was told but it isn't as great as it was described out to be. Fish was not too bad but for too expensive, not worth it. Duck was weird.
4
This is our second time here and we always enjoy the savouries. The dessert the first time was okay but the second time around, the desserts were a bit weird. The hay pannacotta was not as good but at least the sorbet was good.Nevertheless we will come back. The entrees and mains are good and service is also good
4
Went here for the set lunch ($30++ for 2 courses), chose a vegetarian main which was tiny but delicious and a dessert. The dessert was unusual - burnt coconut husk with plum and coconut sorbet. Service was very attentive, restaurant is very popular so was a little cramped and tables are very close to each other. Overall a nice lunch and will return for dinner perhaps
4
Food is creative and beautiful. Perfect for posting on instagram. Set lunch is decently priced although the portion is generally on the small side.
5
Came down for lunch and the course lunch was reasonably priced. Service was really good. Some of the menu on the lunch set is available in the ala carte menu but with a more expensive price, but probably at a bigger portion
5
I went to Jowl for the first time last week with 2 colleagues and the food was amazing! Such a treat for all of us and we enjoyed the beautiful food presentation, the knowledgeable staff and the ambience. Will definitely go back!
5
Every morsel was tasty and we handed back cleaned out plates for every course! Generous portions that was just enough to keep one satisfied yet not too much to spoil the rest of the tasting menu dishes.
4
This is a nice cosy restaurant with personalised service.
Food is alway nice and tasty.
Recommended to try.
4
The restaurant is situated along Boon Tat Street, nice an cosy ambience and quality food served. Really enjoyed although portions are relatively small
5
Went for a meal at cheek by jowl on 09.03.2017. I have to apologise for making a mistake by booking the reservation on 08.03 instead. The service staff was forgiving and welcome me on the next day. Choose the counter seat to have a close experience with Chef Rishi and his team and it was really wonderful! His team took turns to serve me and explain to me in detail for each course. Amazing simple combination of ingredients! Thumbs up
5
I ordered a 3-course lunch menu and left extremely satisfied over one of the best lunches I've had this year.The beetroot was an amazing starter. It had a ribbon of pickled beetroot, on top of cubes of salt-baked beetroot cubes, on top of goat cream cheese. It was an uncommon combination of sour, earthy and gamey, but everything combined perfectly. A highly recommended dish.Next, I had the barramundi. It was served with charred lettuce, prawn floss, caramelised onions, with a layer of prawn foam. The fish was perfect - crispy skin, firm yet soft flesh. The sides were not common, but combined really well to gave the dish a rich umami kick. Another very good dish.Finally, the cherries dessert. It was another strange combination of flavours that worked brilliantly. There's burnt coconut husk meringue, cherries macerated with Szechuan pepper, and butter vinegar - it's a new world of flavours you've got to taste for yourself.Service was great as well, with the staff refilling my glass of warm water constantly and always with a pleasant smile.This could be one of my favourite restaurants
3
Went there in a group of 4, but was disappointed by the food. Felt that this place was over-hyped, flavours and portion were rather bad in my opinion. Especially since we went in a big group... no one felt filled/happy and we had to go somewhere else after that to continue our meal.
5
Sitting at the kitchen counter, catching up with friends, chatting with the Chef Rishi and the ever wonderful host Manuela is one of life's pleasures. The atmosphere here is perfect to lounge, chat, drink and eat at a pace that always sees me the last to leave. The cuisine claims to be "Modern Australian" - but what you will eat is far beyond that simple moniker. It is creative, whimsical and clever. Fusions of unexpected flavours married together perfectly in elegantly framed plates. Each dish testament to an Exec Chef and his team at the top of their game.Visit soon. Get a seat at the counter. Go with a date, or go with friends. You will not be disappointed
5
Recently we went to Cheek by Jowl for a group lunch. It was Excellent and Fair value for money. All of our friends were very pleased with it. It was fine dining at an economical price
4
Value for money set lunch with wonderful offerings! A bit sad that the crab starter has just been changed to arctic char but I also love arctic char so it was still good! My sister-in-law the vegan opted for the beetroot starter with goat cheese which was beautifully presented and tasted just as good. Her mains of the roasted pumpkin was not as dramatic as the beetroot. The rest of us tried the nicely seared barramundi (serving a bit small but ok for me - not a man size eater though!) and the steak & frites were reasonably good.A must- visit lunch destination but you must have the time to wait for your dishes especially if it is full house and you should make a reservation
5
I went to this restaurant for dinner twice with different friends. I have to say the experience of both dinners were wonderful! The first time I tried the main dishes on the menus. From the starters to the main courses and the desserts were so delicious. The second time we tried the set menus which was designed by the chef. We had about 8 different dishes, a small amount but with really interesting combinations of materials and good quality. The dishes were serviced by some young chefs. They also introduced the dishes in details! We felt the price were reasonable, and we really enjoyed the dinner very much
4
Great food and great service. We decided to take the lunch set menu and my selection was the raw beef salad. I completely missed out the cured egg yolk as one of the ingredients .. it's just gives a very eggy aftertaste in your mouth... if one is comfortable with that then it's ok.. I liked it but only for the aftertaste I don't think I will order that again . My main was the Barramundi which was awesome. Crispy skin, soft barramundi flesh accompanied with prawn floss was too good !! And best was the cheese platter - towards the end ... the blue cheese was like butter and accompanied with raising jam was too good. Definitely coming back again
4
Had a wonderful meal at this delightful little restaurant. We ordered a selection of starters and mains to share. They were all cooked to perfection. The menu is short but the quality of food is excellent. The portions are rather small. I should add that it is not value for money. I thought the place was a little cramped and very noisy
5
I have been several times and on each occasion have been wowed by the tastiness of Chef Rishi's cooking. It is based on flavour pairings that work and the food is always tasty & full of flavour. The last time was for lunch & had the crabmeat with pickled squash to start with. This came in a flavoursome crab broth. Ordered the chef's version of steak frites and was served a perfectly cooked piece of meat which married nicely with the accompanying cafe de paris butter. Dessert centered around a honey dew melon theme. I liked that it wasn't overly sweet & was a nice end to the meal. Prices are reasonable & service is very friendly. Look forward to my next encounter.
5
My girlfriend and I went on a date here Friday night after she scored us a reservation with seats at the bar. It was fascinating to watch the kitchen work. We both ordered the five course tasting menu, which did an excellent job of hitting highlights of the regular menu. Chef Rishi Naleendra was very friendly and approachable, making us feel right at home. I can honestly say that I had the best lamb of my life here, and the melon sorbet at dessert was perfectly on point. We'll definitely be going back
5
We went there for a family dinner and had the tasting menu. I am a vegetarian and we had informed the chef in advance about this. I must say that I was absolutely impressed by the food. The vegetarian dishes were very tasty and well presented. The beetroot entrÃ©e was fantastic and so was the roast pumpkin with spiced cashew nut, kale and pumpkin seeds . The non-vegetarian food was also very, good but my family all wanted a bit of my food as it was soo...o good.The service was great. Manuela provided the personal touch and chef Rishi also came over for a bit. On whole, it was a wonderful experience and I would recommend it to all our friends. We did not really like the laksa icream with green chillies. That was partly because the previous dessert served (melon sorbet mascarpone parfait, pickled melon rind and caraway seeds) was out of this world! The only real problem was that we were too full to move after the meal. :) I would like to go for an ala carte experience the next time
2
I am totally disappointed. Instead of giving just 1 out of 5, I hv given 2 because the price is reasonable. $88 for the set dinner in a causal setting restaurant. Many young executives on a Thursday night. I guess the location and price point must have drawn the crowd.My friend & I do not know how to appreciate the food combination for almost all the dishes. I do not like fish unless they are done very nicely. Obversely it was not. The other main course (Pork) was not good too.It was highly recommended by the owner so my disappointment is even greater!If I have to given them the benefit of doubt...maybe the main chef is on leave that day
5
Had a wonderful 3 course set lunch at the restaurant. For starters, we had the raw beef salad. This was nice and didn't look completely raw but more seared. The salad and beef was very tasty. For the mains, we had the barramundi which had a nice crispy skin, yet tender on the meat. There was a very nice sauce which made it very flavourful. For dessert, we had the coconut laksa ice cream. There was green Chilli in the ice cream, some nuts and coconut sorbet which was heavenly. Overall, very happy with the meal. We also ordered a glass of white Sauvignon Blanc and a Pinot Noir. We ended the meal with coffee. There was two of us and the bill came to $148. My only gripe was that they had only one airconditioner on with the fans blowing. This made the room a bit stuffy, hence the Low rating for atmosphere.
4
Comfortable and friendly service. Food was good, but main course portion was a little small, about similar portion size as the appetizers. Overall, my sis did have a great birthday lunch at CBJ. Thank you.
5
really good restaurant for dinning and gathering! Food was so nice and the staff there were so friendly and helpful! The only pity thing was they don't have much choice of beer!
5
We thoroughly enjoyed the tasting menu as an intro to this restaurant can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes soon
5
Impeccable service from attentive and friendly staff. We were not rushed, but given a good balance of service, and time to ourselves. The food was divine, incredible flavors and textures. The beetroot entree was not only beautiful, but delicious as well. Barramundi was cooked to perfection. The cocktails were yum. Definitely recommend going here for date night or just a yummy meal . Yum yum yum ❤
5
We ordered the tasting menu which was a few small snacks followed by 4 courses and then a dessert. It was good food throughout and everything was fresh and tasted brilliant. Even though I don't usually like eating tongue the lamb tongue was pretty good to me.
5
The menu was quite interesting with great taste and nice dish decor. The combination of culture and taste come out relatively. When coming to dessert section, the menu is quite creative. We received good suggestion all along the night in selection of menu and drink list from the waiter. The service was great with friendly atmosphere. We would definitely come back

5
Went for an end of year work lunch for about 20 of us so we closed the restaurant. Basically a set main and choices for entree and dessert for this large group. A few extras thrown in such as coffin Bay oysters with smoked tomato granita. Very good. Pickled beetroot with mascarpone ( from memory- fair bit of wine since that course) was terrific. The set beef rib eye on the bone was delicious although some slices were basically raw. Dessert was sensational. Coconut laksa ice cream with Chilli and pomelo.Balance of Flavours just right and really refreshing. Terrific meal
3
We had some very nice appetizers to share washed down with glasses of Sauvignon Blanc.Between the four of us we tried the duck, pork chop and lamb shoulder main courses. We added the baked potato to share with the table. These dishes were all very good indeed. However, we ordered an Australian Syrah/Mourvedre blend which was brought to the table direct from refrigeration. It was much too cold. Our attempts to allow it to open up and warm up were thwarted as the waiter kept replenishing the glasses every time someone took a sip. A red wine of this quality really does need to be allowed to reach room temperature and be given time, preferably by decanting, to open up. It would probably have been a really excellent accompaniment to the meat dishes we chose – but we’ll never know for sure. This was quite a spoiler for the evening as far as having a good opinion of the restaurant. If we were to consider going back we’d have to remember to order a fish or seafood dish and accompany it with a white wine; but I doubt we’ll bother
5
We had the Barramundi and the Pork Chop. Everything tasted fantastic. Service is very good. I had one of the bottled cocktails - Wattleseed Negroni. The Negroni was soooo good.We had the 6pm reservation but we were so hungry so we had something before our dinner. We regretted that as we would've ordered other dishes. Will surely come back to taste other menu
4
Food is interesting and well paired, especially the quail! Tender and the condiments provide so much flavour and textures. However service was disappointing, tea was served without informing us of the charges - a shocking $5 for a small cup each
3
The food was good. The atmosphere was great but the service staff don't seem very happy working there. No love felt at all.
5
3rd time in 4 months at this restaurant. Never fail to surprise. Will definitely be back again. Great food and service.
5
Talented Chef with his delightful Wife operates this noveau Australian cuisine； while occasssionally incorporating local Ingredients into his very dainty but subtantial dishes. Ask for their very reasonably priced degustation menu.
5
the chef knew that this was a repeat visit and took the effort to make new dishes for me that was not on the menu. he was eager to share his creativity and get our feedback. the flight of amuse bouche was a warm welcome; infact the delicacy and execution was on par with any fine dining restaurants.service was warm & genuine.price is very reasonabledefinitely will be bac
1
The service , needs a lot of attention . There were no smiles all around and we felt that it's a little sad, especially when the place looks great paired with well thought of dinner menu. The wines are over priced and really overrated . To think that unlisted collection is a well know company . Boring beverage menu and sad service staff 
5
Had my birthday celebration there will a bunch of friends. We orders almost everything on the menu. Everything was perfect. Presentation of food was nicely assembled and the flavors were excellent. I especially love the oysters with the shaved frozen tomato sauce. Their signature barramundi was very perfectly grilled. Service staff were attentive and very well-informed about the dishes.
5
Excellent food with beautiful presentation, fresh and sometimes unusual ingredients creatively put together. I have been there at least 5-10 times and each visit was always a delightful and satisfying experience. Reservations recommended as they can get busy during meal times. Go try if you have not done so - you will not be disappointed
4
Heard so much about this place. Finally gotten the chance to drop by for dinner with friends. Each dish is well executed! Value for money & definitely worth a visit. We had so much food till we have no room for dessert. Will visit again & leave room for desert. Would love to try the coconut dessert
5
This is our second time dining in this restaurant. This time we have the set lunch. The service was very attentive, the confit duck with salted caramel sauce and waffle were delicious. And so was the ice cream with laksa leaf and pomelo. Will visit again.
5
We ate an 3 course lunsj with good wine pairing. Very good service and we were taken good care of by the host/owners.
Nice atmosphere and a kitchen with fokus on good tastes and good presentation.
5
The food is really interesting here - really creative! I love it. Service is excellent too! Definitely will go back.
4
Great service and food was good. loved the chef selections and catering of menu to suit dietary preferencesupplement.
4
The food was unusual. We liked the duck confit and roast pork. But we found the first pork a but too under cooked and difficult to bite.
5
Must try, chef is daring to come up with ideas and interesting combinations and full of surprises! Simply amazing !
5
One of the best meals I've had in SG. Went for the set menu which changes daily and you don't know what you get till it arrives. Was reasonably priced and the presentation and quality of the food was outstanding. Was worried at first it wouldn't be enough however the dishes kept coming.
4
We went for the 5 course set menu n it was excellent. The foods were well presented in a refreshing way n servings were generous. One set back was the inadequate air-conditioning in view of the fact that the windows at the front are left wide open. It can get uncomfortably warm so be sure to ask for a cool table as far inside the restaurant as possibl
4
Food was very good . We had the surprise 5 course set with wine pairing which was excellent and the somalier/waitress is good at explaining the grade of wine and its origin. The only two things lacking was that : I made a reservation for a birthday and I was initially served to a table near the door which was loud and slightly hot , which I personally think they should put more attention to such details . The music was country loud music and the hostess said it fits the theme of the place ,which I find amusing . Regardless, I will go back again for the food ,
4
Ordered the following: Oyster, Lamb and Coconut.Oyster - A fresh oyster served with tomato granita on top. The smoked tomato flavour of the granita and the melon-like sweetness of the oyster did not pair perfectly, but the combination of textures in the dish was exciting nevertheless.Lamb - Lamb shoulder was tender and served with caviar which gave it additional texture and flavour. The vegetables (cavolo nero, celery root) were cooked well and paired perfectly with the rich lamb. It was delicious.Coconut - Essentially laksa gravy deconstructed. Coconut ice cream was rich and creamy the way I like it, accentuated with green chilis for an interesting tangy and spicy aftertaste. Laksa leaf ice cream, plated beside the coconut ice cream, was unique and aromatic but could have been stronger flavoured. Pomelo pieces offered texture and a bitter fragrance that complemented both rich ice creams. Very interesting dessert worth trying
4
The best things about Cheek by Jowl is the chef's bold use of Asian flavours, and his technically strong treatment of each element of the dishes. However, I found the portion sizes for the lunch set menu on the small side.There were three of us dining together; two of us ordered the set lunch (S$30 for 2 courses) while the third opted for the a la carte Confit Duck with Waffles (S$36). The portion size was generous: whole duck leg with a side salad and three waffles. The flavours were well balanced, although my friend who ordered the dish thought that the sweet, sticky sauce that accompanied the duck could be rich and cloying after several bites of the food. As for the sets, we had the Roasted Quail and the Salt-Baked Beetroot as appetisers. The quail is the better of the two dishes - the breast was wonderfully cooked such that the meat was tender and moist. While the beetroot was nicely accompanied by creamy goat cheese, the flavours were muted and not very exciting. Both of us who ordered the sets had Barramundi for the main course. The fish was well cooked, if slightly overdone - but not enough for it to lose its moisture. There were lovely Japanese-inspired flavours in the dish, complemented by puffed rice for crunch and texture. I wish the fish had been bigger though.The waiters were friendly, and each dish was explained when it was served to the table. Also, the restaurant was happy to let us linger for a considerable time after we had finished our food. The vibe of the place is relaxed - a nice place to catch up with friends
5
Been here twice and the food is and service were spot on as usual. One of my favourite places to go to in Singapore. Desserts are delicious.
5
Went there with my family on a public holiday. We ordered the surprise 5 course meal. 2 snacks, 2 starters, main course and dessert.
Everything was delightful and well plated.
The oysters are a must have!
5
Could not fault anything at Cheek by Jowl. Food was amazing. We had the tasting menu and the additional Tommohawk steak between 6 of us. Service was great.
5
Have eaten here three times and all at all times the food and service has been excellent. No wonder it's always packed. Highly recommend it
5
Great place and atmosphere. It is open feeling and there was such a buzz. Food was very good and excellent. Would come here again,
5
Came here for a birthday dinner and Chef Marcus accommodated our meal to perfection. Service was tiptop with explanation of every dish in specific details was really impressive. Ambiance was really nice and very suitable for a romantic dinner or a special occasion. Recommended Food: Oyster, Roasted Quail (starter), Barramundi, Steak & Potatos.Happy Hour Wine going at $12 per glas

Food started off pretty good with the appetizers of smoked mackerel and quail. A good start to dinner but what followed was really disappointing. Had the Barramundi and the lamb shoulder as our mains. The barramundi came to us under cooked. Cut through the center of the fish and more than 50% of the flesh was opaque. We got it sent back to the kitchen, came back and the other components on the plate wasn't hot , the skin of the fish wasn't crispy and they gave us back the same fish which we had already cut into half. I mean I'm fine with that but that is what distinguishes an average restaurant from a good restaurant that delivers a good experience.Next was the lamb shoulder. All we tasted was spices and none of the lamb flavour came through. It feels more like drinking a bowl of herbal soup. Spices were way too overwhelming and completely destroyed the whole dish where the other components just doesn't go well with the overwhelming spice flavor. I certainly wouldn't pay $38 just to taste spices.Service was pretty average where it wasn't warm enough to make you feel at home and servers were not attentive enough. We took almost 30 minutes to finish the lamb dish as we thought we should finished what we had ordered even though it was not to our liking. No one actually noticed that we were struggling with it and came forward to ask if there was anything wrong. I have been to many casual restaurants where servers are actually attentive enough to notice if the food isn't to your liking.Overall what seemed like an exciting and interesting dinner with all the hype and good reviews it has been receiving, the main courses failed to deliver which is what one would most look forward to. Service too was pretty average. Not a place where I enjoyed the food nor its hospitality
4
A friend highly recommended the duck confit with waffle for our lunch. And I am glad I followed her recommendation and forewent the well-valued set lunch. The combined flavor of the duck, the waffles, and the salad was very well balanced. I liked the flavor infused to the cucumber slices. I also enjoyed the pear dessert which was light and sweet. Perfect closure after the duck and waffles.
4
Service was great at the restaurant where we were served promptly. They were attentive and prompt in serving our needs. Had a 2 snack + 4 course meal (I didn't really consider the 2 snacks as a course) as part of the $100Gourmet deal. Every single dish was well presented (not fanciful) and the texture of each dish came well together. Music was too loud for me, but it is the concept for this restaurant. Personally prefer a more quiet and private atmosphere for gourmet meals
5
A small but interesting menu, with food done really well. I much prefer this concept as it ensures consistency and gives you the opportunity to try out several dishes. Celebrated my birthday here and we did just that - stand out items were the barramundi (my favourite dish!), roast pumpkin, and the special of the day - suckling pig with a sublime kimchi salad. We also had a generous cheese plate and the yoghurt parfait, which is a must try! I was also treated to an absolutely delicious chocolate dessert as a birthday treat. The service was excellent and it was lovely to meet chef Rishi and his wife. Best of all, the food and wine are really well-priced compared to other restaurants which are similar in concept
5
Well presented. Staff were professional and well-trained. Nice ambience. Food were on-point and taste great! Definitely highly recommended!
3
Although the presentation of their dishes are beautiful, the ingredients used are not harmoniously chosen to complement each other.
5
The food was interesting (but not too interesting that it moves into the strange category) and delicious. The wait staff politely explained each dish as it was set down and was attentive and courteous throughout.
5
Amazing, amazing wine list, amazing service. Highly recommended. Go for the chefs menu. Must trys: beetroot, wild venison, quail, ribeye, lamb shoulder.
5
Overall food was good but no strong highlights in particular. Degustation menu was well put together except the desert which I felt didn't quite 'fit'. One small mention that the oyster dish didn't taste particularly fresh. Other than that, I'd still recommend the place.
5
Chef Rishi's menu is brilliant...very risky with nuts in almost every dish but he did it!
Bravo!
Manuella & Sean looked after our table everytime we come...very friendly, warm and knowledgeable!
Keep up the good work!

We have lived away for some 6 years returning yearly for visits. And every time there's some exciting restaurants. Singapore has amazing offerings to tease your taste buds. The range from local fare (Chinese, Indian, Malay, Penarakan) to fancy restaurants. Cheek by Jowl was a place we need to try. Modern Australian : We had two main (lamb shoulder & confit duck leg) 2 appetizers ( 2 servings of beetroot with goat's cheese & 1 roasted quail) 2 desserts (yogurt parfait & caramelised pear) costs us SG215. The desserts were fabulous. Very much the highlight of our meals. The various flavors marry very well. A little hesitant with clove icecream but that was our favorite. Taste was subtle but enhances the sweetness of the julienned pear. The appetizers raised your expectations of the main which we felt was average. The confit duck leg doesn't quite have the nice herb infused flavor although it's nicely done with a slight crisp. And meat is tender. If curiosity kills the cat instead of your pocket ... Have a go.
5
We had a fabulous dinner with friends at Cheek by Jowl and we are still talking about it! Rishi the Chef and his lovely wife Manuela who looks after the front of house are a formidable team. They have created a casual, welcoming atmosphere but don't be fooled, the food is elevated to a whole new level. We had the chefs menu and every dish was to die for. The Chef was very accommodating for one of our party who had some food preferences and he went above and beyond to serve up dishes that were amazing (Always a good idea to let the Chef know in advance if you have any food requirements when having the chefs menu).The service was impeccable and the wine list was great. Run don't walk
5
My husband and I had the pleasure of dining at Cheek by Jowl on Friday last week with 5 other friends (they all live in Singapore we were visiting from Perth).We had the chefs menu degustation which I can confidently say was one of the best meals of my life...and I've had some pretty incredible meals. From the 'snacks' crispy cracker with smoked eel and an incredible cauliflower soup concoction which blew my mind to the main of suckling pig (one of our friends doesn't eat seafood or pig and her meals were just a sensational) were phenomenal - using a lot of adjectives but there's no way around it. It's a well appointed narrow space the service fabulous and G&Ts spot on.When we visit Singapore next year we will be back. Do yourself a favour and get there.

Chef Reeshi Naleendra is a talented cook, good with his flavour combinations. I first tasted his cooking at the now defunct Maca & he's certainly raised his A game since starting Cheek By Jowl. This is a smart restaurant serving some really tasty Australian food. The duck with waffles is the dish of the moment but you can bet that the Chef has other dishes up his sleeve. Over the course of three visits, everything I've had was exceptional. I remember the slow cooked lamb, the roasted pumpkin, the poached rhubarb with lingonberry ice cream. You can be assured of a good meal and a friendly welcome every time.

YUM! YUM! YUM!
Not cheap, even by Singapore standards but dEEEElicious!
Great service, great wine and the flavoursome food- just superb!
Also loved the simple menu.
What they do, they do very well indeed!
4
Certainly not cheap, esp for SG standards, but the food is fantastic and portion sizes are decent. Roasted pumpkin, tomatoe salad with crushed macademia, barramundi and lamb shoulder were all outstanding.
4
Food was really good and service was fantastic as well. It was a bit pricey though. The menu is quite limited so I would not recommend the place to picky eaters.
5
Great restaurant. Very very good food - light, flavoursome and imaginative. Exceptional value for the quality of the cooking and service. Super wine list. This place is a gem.
5
The food was well paired with a very crisp reisling from the Clare Valley. Australia. Unfortunately the tiles made the sound bounce, so slightly noisy to hear.
4
It was our first visit and we had previously heard good things about Cheek by Jowl. All the food we ordered was excellent. Each dish was expertly crafted and really special. I appreciated that the staff explained what's in the food and the cocktails when they serve them. Yes I would definitely visit again, on another special occasion, or when we want to splurge and give ourselves a treat
5
The food is so good because of the imaginative flavours the chef uses in each dish. Ingredients are fresh, and the portions are not small. Drinks are on the pricey side though, but that's Singapore anyway.Its not a large menu - but the food was so good i would go back and have the same dishes again!Really stand out dishes for me were the barramundi with bonito butter (who would have thought of bonito + butter?) and the laksa leaf ice cream
5
The chef is absolutely amazing in the way his combines unique flavours. The food is fresh, crisp and incredibly flavourful. We tried the smoked mackerel, wild venison, barramundi and their steak. For dessert we had the rhubarb that topped a spectacular evening. The portions are tasting sizes, you may want to order the 5 course option. Also the negroni is to die for
2
Came here with raving expectations, in a group of 4 and ordered almost the entire dinner menu to share (most appetisers, and all mains were ordered). Most of them failed terribly, and we cannot understand the hype of this place.If there is one dish you have to try from this place, we would recommend the duck and waffles. The waffles were delish!Everything else disappointed us badly. I have to say the service is good though, but i notice most people there for dinner were having drinks instead of food. Bill came up to $2xx, and I guess we are never coming back
4
My wife and I sampled the tasting menu which included a snack, two appetisers, two mains, and a dessert. All the dishes were delicious and left us wanting more. The roasted quail (appetiser) and barramundi (main) were the most memorable. We're not heavy eaters and while we enjoyed all the dishes found the portions too small. Would have been great to have at least a more filling portion in at least one of the dishes for a more fulfilling meal
4
Food and service is great.
Only, small, downside is that because of the open kitchen you come out smelling like food

Cozy atmosphere, good cocktail, smiling employees and just great tasty food. Small intimate restaurant, casual and relaxed total experience and nearby bars for afterwards drinks.

Chef Rishi and his team keep delivering fantastic food with fresh ingredients bursting with flavour. In my most recent visit I tried the pork collar, chicken and rhubarb dessert. Fantastic!

Perfect from reservation to the end of the meal. Impeccable service with the staff knowing who to give the birthday cake to. Great place !

Wonderful food although portions were a bit small. Disappointing selection of desserts, only two to chose from. Lovely decor and ambience

When the majority of the guests in a modern Australian restaurant in Singapore are foreigners and it is full at lunchtime then you know the food is good. We had the S$38 three course lunch at the bar at Cheek by Jowl. Service was efficient. Whilst the portion sizes were not large they were sufficient and extremely good. A highlight for me was the dessert which included Asian flavours such as green chili which sounds odd but was good. I will be back.

Had lunch here and all three in my party has the set. Excellent value for money. The food and service were impeccable. Thoroughly enjoyed the pork starter and the barramundi for the main. The laksa pesto ice cream for dessert was interesting to say the least. The music was a little loud and we struggled a little to hear each other.Overall a great experience and definitely worth a return visit

We were a party of 4 celebrating a birthday, and all of us tried out the chef's dinner menu. I told the manager, Manuela that it was a birthday treat and checked if they would be ok if we brought a cake. She suggested that they could organise a chocolate parfait for the birthday guest instead - which relieved my mind of of one more thing to organise for my guests who were visiting Singapore. The service on the evening we were there was friendly and efficient, the 8 mains + appetizers were whisked out one after the other. At the end of the 4th course, I remarked to the chef that the portions seemed small and he assured us that there were more to come. By the time we ended the meal with the beef cheeks and the laksa leaf ice cream, our stomachs were replete and completely satisfied. Great portioning, an adventure to our palates and overall, excellent value at $120/pax with drinks

I am guessing the ranking of this restaurant is only due to it being small and relatively new as it should be vying for the best eating establishment in Singapore - it's that good!I am travelling for 4 months and I was lucky enough to be taken along by two friends who live locally.I cannot begin to describe the complexity of flavours I experienced - every mouthful was a journey as every taste bud was tickled, then teased, then satisfied at various moments... Amazing!I highly recommend the tasting menu.. The owner and head chef come the table to describe everything in detail to engage your mind before letting your mouth take over..My best eating experience in a long long time...

My husband and I dined at Cheek by Jowl last Friday after hearing rave reviews from friends as well as online. It did not disappoint in the slightest. The food was spectacular, one of the best meals we've had in recent memory. Every single dish was an amazing combination of textures and flavours. For starters, the beetroot with goat cheese was perfectly balanced and delicious, the braised pork shoulder with pickled apple and turnip was beautifully tender and flavourful. For mains we shared the lamb which was cooked perfectly and completed perfectly with the peas, mint, parsnips and pistachio it was served with. But the duck confit with waffles was the dish I came to try, and it was a particular standout. It was beautifully flavoured and so tender, the sauce was divine and the waffles were crispy perfection. Though there were only two desserts to choose from I was thrilled to see one included rhubarb, and it was fantastic. The ginger caramel custard it is served with was smooth and sweet, and the roasted white chocolate is one of the best things I've tasted in a dessert. Truly excellent food, creative and tasty. And the service was equally excellent. Everyone we interacted with was warm, friendly and so welcoming. Manuela who greeted and seated us was lovely, and the servers we interacted with were friendly and very knowledgeable about the food and menu. They were able to make recommendations and explain the dishes perfectly, and the fact that the chefs present some of the dishes is a great touch! My husband was quite late for our reservation, over half an hour, and during this time I never felt rushed or like I was inconveniencing anyone with the wait, quite the opposite in fact. Overall it was a truly spectacular dining experience and a place I will return to soon
