This place is a place to get good local foods with reasonable price. I love the carrot cake sold by Local Delights. Very authentic local delights with no frills. This place also has other kinds of food too. It has stalls of Siam delicacies, Japanese cuisine, La mian, roasted delights, house of fish soup, mixed veg rice, mini wok congee, ban mian, fishball noodles, and, braised duck kway chap. Oops a stall selling soft drinks too. Must try if youâ€™re at Terminal 3 Changi Airport

After being on a plane for 8 plus hours, how nice it was to enjoy a real barista coffee instead of the tar tasting liquid served on the plane. My flat white was delicious, the service quick and the staff very friendly. Be sure to call in again on my next trip through Terminal 3
