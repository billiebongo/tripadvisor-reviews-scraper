Been my favorite traditional mooncake. Loved their lotus pasta baked mooncake, not too sweet and the outer crust is baked to perfection with slight roasted favour.

I visited Terminal 3 at the Singapore's Changi Airport on 13/5/2015 to kill time while waiting to catch a flight to Perth. When I stepped out of the inter-terminal monorail, I saw the shop sign TAI CHONG KOK. I thought that was a People Republic of China's shop because CHONG KOK means CHINA in Mandarin and Cantonese. When I entered the shop and saw the pastries in the display cupboards and shelves, I realised that it was a spin off of the wonderful Cantonese bakery shop in the Singapore's Chinatown. I was so very happy to know that I need not wait till the once a year Lunar Autumn Mooncakes Festival to buy my favourite 'piglets' cakes (cakes in the shape of pigs) made from flour pastry used for mooncakes. As in the old days, the 'piglets' came in plastic 'piglet baskets'; so very nostalgic. I can now buy my favourite pastry every time I pass through the Changi Airport. Bliss
