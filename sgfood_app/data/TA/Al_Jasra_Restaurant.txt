7.90$ for all you cant eat prata !!We had 7 each out of a choice of 16. You order as you go, meaning they will charge you extra for the ones you cannot eat, which is fair.It is made to order so you have to wait a good 15 mins between your orders, but at least you don't feel so stuffed afterwards.The dough isn't too greasy either, that's nice

We ordered the prata buffet. It was not worth it. The staff were not the friendliest and were not keen on making it easy for us to order. Other people who came and ordered way way after us got their orders earlier. We waited more than 30min before our first round of prata came. We were so turned off by the service that we wanted to just leave. It was also difficult for us to call for service. We tried to order the second round but the service was still very slow even though by that point, there weren't much customers left. We waited for another 30min before we gave up and left feeling frustrated. Overall, not very satisfied with the place. Would not recommend to order buffet. Might be better if you order ala carte because they will serve you faster
