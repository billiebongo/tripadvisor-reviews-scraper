After closure of Bukit Purmei's Lor Mee, this is the only stall that still serve traditional Lor Mee with enough ingredient to cover each and every bite. At $3 and $3.50, the noodles are considered cheap. However, the queue is the hassle you have to put up with in order to eat a bowl

Be prepared for long queues. The old aunty who prepares is very nice, friendly & helpful. The mid-age bloke is also efficient & helpful. Comparing to the other Lor Mee in the other central corner, this one gives more quantity, more ingredients & cost cheaper too. Service wise is relatively better than the other one (who is slightly aloof & unfriendly). This one started late at 11am & surprisingly finished quickly too because most customers prefer eating this one

The lor mee here is fantastic but you must be prepared to queue for it. However, the queue moves very fast as the people who operate this stall is very efficient and organised. Love to eat the lor egg and the gravy is perfect. They also provide the garlic and the vinegar which make the lor mee very delicious
