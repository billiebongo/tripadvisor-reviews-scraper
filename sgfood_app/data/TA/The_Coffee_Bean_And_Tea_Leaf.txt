Good for a Me time. Free wifi is accessible. Ordered Chicken Mayo sandwich which is huge for 1 pax. Love the ice mocha. All is good!

It is very good. It has cake and coffee too. I love coffee bean and tea leaf. I will always go there to drink coffee.

This is a really nice outlet. The menu is the same as always, but the staff is always extra-helpful.
