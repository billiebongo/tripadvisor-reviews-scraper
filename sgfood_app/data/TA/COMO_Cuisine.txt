They serves excellent fresh product always with style and in a small portion. The best is probably to order few small plate and share to discover. Bravo for the fish curry ! Simply excellent.I would consider the price 20% up to what i expected but eventually you get a very good service and posh environment

We went to Como cos PS Cafe was full. It was a pleasant experience. We like the white clean look of the restaurant. Very contemporaryThe bread was excellent. We had 2 servings. We ordered pumpkin soup and octopus for starters. It was good. Steak, fish and chicken followed. It does not disappoint. The price is a bit expensive for the food. Overall a pleasant experience. The service staff was friendly. Ida, the Asst Manager, was very attentive. Great service.

Slightly lacking in atmosphere but the food was amazing and service excellent without being intrusive. Cool in the middle of a huge rainstorm with umbrellas to get you from the bar to the restaurant (a necessity in Singapore!). Menu was varied and all the food we had was excellent; we chose a variety of starters to share which was fun - the samosas were outstanding and the octopus fabulous. Very well located at Dempsey.

We sat down mid afternoon and were presented with a very limited brunch menu. I chose a "Truffle bikini sandwich" which is a fancy name for a ham and cheese toasty. The price was $24 so I was expecting some embellished spin on the sandwich. I was also expecting a substantial meal or at least enough for lunch. When it arrived it was a very small brioche toasted sandwich. The truffle was indistinguishable and the cheese and parma ham were added is such stingy proportions I was amazed. To top it off the brioche was burnt black. I decided to give it one bite just in case I was missing the point but it really was a tiny, stingy burnt, charcoal tasting, cheese and ham toasty for $24. The point here is that you have a kitchen happy to serve a small burnt dish for $24 that anyone with any pride about their food would have thrown directly in the bin. I'd add that my girlfriend had a main sized chicken salad with again was small and only a stingy amount of chicken added. This place was a huge disappointment. If you are hungry don't go because the portions are tiny and the prices high. Add to that, the kitchen have no pride in what they are serving. Do yourself a favour and give it a miss

One of the worst culinary experiences in a long time. Menu has only 7 main dish options. I took the pork schnitzel and came burned and massively overcooked. Place looks smart and modern but food was simply bad. I won’t recommend

Food was great. Curry snapper. Beef. Linguine with peas and crab. Vegetarian friendly. Everything was cooked to perfection, not over powering in taste - there seems to be a lot of thought put into the assembly of ingredients. It felt very special and mucho credit to chefsThe reason I didn't give full pointS was the fact that restaurant chose to charge for everything. Even starter breads, no birthday treat and the wines mostly start $125 and above.I love the food but I think they could consider making birthdays more specia

This new restaurant in Dempsey Hill has only been open 8 months, but is already leading the way in healthy, clean, gourmet eating.The fit out is bright, white & calming. A hanging forest from the ceiling creates an aura of mystique.For lunch there is a set menu or a regular menu.I had the seasonal green soup which was stunning. It tasted good & it tasted good for me. My body started glowing as I ate it - seriously good.The fish with peas and a super light crust was fresh & light. It tasted healthy.I couldn’t resist the chocolate tart, which is (apparently) healthy, but very luxe & delicious.A great new Singapore find. Don’t miss it if eating well is a priority.

So after hearing about the latest restaurant in the COMO Group from my friends, I finally decided to find out what all the hype was about. The decor of the restaurant is very minimalistic and has a green touch to it with the air plants and tables.I was quite late and by the time I was in the restaurant was quite full, and I expected to have to wait sometime for my table but to my surprise I was escorted to my table immediately with a wide smile which set the tone for my experience.I was served by Monish, and to be honest this was the best service I've had in a while. He greeted me with warmth and introduced himself. When I asked for some recommendations regarding the menu, He did something very unique by asking me what are some items I like in general and was extremely knowledgeable about the menu, answering my every inquiry about the menu. Throughout my entire experience in the restaurant he never stopped smiling and I was in awe of how he was going about doing his thing. The thing I really liked about Monish was that even though he was very busy, he never made me feel that he was, constantly coming back to check on me and my experience and even took the time out to talk to me about myself and my hobbies. It was a extremely amazing experience and I would surely go back just for the Service.The food was genuinely very good and I could taste a combination of different cuisines with each dish that was recommended. I had the Sashimi, the Prawns, Samosas and Romaine Salad. All of which were unique and satisfying in their own way. Finally I must credit the Chef for the Beef Wellington, which came with Truffle. I ate it all before anyone could take any photos of it.Overall I would say my experience in Como Cuisine was an unforgettable one and I would highly recommend anyone to try this new place. I would suggest to have an open mind when it comes to the menu. Top Notch Service

the front counter Japanese lady was a bit blur, although I have make a booking and already sit inside the restaurant and she can call me again to ask if I will still come for lunch. Even I already answered her that I have already seated inside the restaurant, she can called me again to ask for the second time if I were coming?!? Anyway, luckily the entire lunch service and dining experience was good. I wouldn't say excellent but it's alright.

Visited this place with kids. The sides and starters offered plenty of small vegeterian options. The main courses were a little restrictive and pricing was high. The ambience was great as well. As with most high end restaurants in Singapore, the cost is frankly prohibitive , but that does not stop the restaurants from running at high occupancy. Overall a great meal, in a good ambience - at a high price

Went for a works Christmas lunch and really enjoyed the food and service. Unfortunately they weren't actually serving any Christmas themed menu items (which in December is a little disappointing) but the set menu I had was very enjoyable. The deep fried broccoli starter and chicken and polenta main were very well cooked. Although the chicken dish would have benefited from a bit more sauce. Staff were very friendly and helpful and I would happily go back in future

Lovely combinations of cuisines creatively assembled in one dish. For starter we had a tasty falafel dish with eggplants and Spanish padron peppers with an Asian style dipping sauce that went very well. Main course was very delicious fish in curry and the other with quinoa, with typical notes but not overspiced.the best -of course- was the dessert, not only the taste experience but also the arrangement on the plate. What I personally liked most: in every dish was one ingredient I didn’t know. Service was also very good and the flair of the interior design is really nice.

This was our 2nd time. Really good food and simple wholesome menu. It's such a shame that with all those staff, and they are nice people, it takes so long for drinks and food to get to you. The quickest thing to arrive was the bill. Staff stand around looking cool but no one has any urgency, this will really hold you back. Sham

It’s very far to rate down a restaurant that offers such exceptional service. From the moment we were seated outdoors; we were in love with the ambient surroundings. And the from the Chef to our server; everyone was fabulous. The Chef specially created a Super spicy vegetarian pasta for us.Enough options for vegetarians.We had the burrata; guacamole and an avocado and greens salad for starters. All of them were delicious! Then we had the best truffle pizza I have ever had , a mushroom risotto (also created out of the menu by the Chef) and a Super spicy pasta that lived up to its name. We really enjoyed the meal and the whole experience. It’s a must do if you’re visiting Singapore!The Warm chocolate cake is all we had space for in the end and was lovely.Their wine list is lovely and I particularly loved their basil ginger Margerita! A must must do!

loved the warm lights and high ceilings, that just made the place both grand yet comfortable; some green plants by the bar helped as well; service was great, food was good, would come back here again

My first visit to COMO Cuisine at Dempsey was a tad disappointing. First I couldn’t really make out the type of cuisine based on the brunch menu. Perhaps it is like the name implies: the cuisine of COMO Hotels, dishes curated from their various resorts. That and the COMO brand probably also set high expectations.Then we were surprised with the relatively small portions and unsophisticated platings. The menu said poached eggs and vegetables but there was only one egg: most breakfasts come with two. Similarly waffles and fried chicken normally comes with large squares of waffles and a couple of sizeable chunks of chicken. COMO’s was half the usual. My buckwheat pancake was interesting but I’m unsure if it was meant to be deliberately soaked in the middle. There was a nice poached plum but I would have liked a generous heap of berries or other fruits too. Our side of slab bacon was the saving grace: it was a nicely charred char siew of belly pork; sinful but yummy! Although we were still hungry, we didn’t bother with dessert which is a spread of pastries.Given the COMO branding, I thought the restaurant could be more elegantly fitted; and to commensurate with the charming surroundings of the old colonial and CMPB buildings. I couldn’t understand the basketball-sized, poker-dotted Japanese paper lanterns (why not huge plain ones since the ceiling's high sans the other bright lights?) with indiscrete wirings and vinyl flooring. However, I do like the centerpiece of air cacti hanging from mid ceiling fixture. Service was decent. But the overall brunch experience – we looked at the lunch and dinner menus and were puzzled and uninspired too – falls short with the likes of PS. Café and Atlas; both (Dempsey and Bukit Timah respectively) had long queues as we drove by later

Food is good. Easy and not difficult to eat. But what differs COMO from other restaurants in the Dempsey enclave is the ambience. The design and layout of this restaurant is so nice to be in. The space that has been chosen feels fresh, clean and uncomplicated. There is no squeeze, no pressure. Just simply a great space to sit, eat, perhaps chat and argue a little. There are many restaurants in Dempsey, each with its own unique personality. COMO is no different with its version of ... CLEAN

This is the fourth and final restaurant at the Como at Dempsey precinct. It recently opened.The cuisine is modern and fusion Asian, celebrating the mix of multicultural culinary experience in Singapore.The minced lamb samosa was delicious. The scallops were decent too.The Wellington beef coated with foie gras was more unusual but my friend testified that the flavours worked.My pasta was quite good too.The two desserts we had were decent too.As a new restaurant it will need to iron out some minor issues to become a popular eatery

Was there yesterday night with my colleagues. Loved the main (the Wellington was tasty but the temperature was not cooked to my preference) and the dessert (the Date Tart was simply heaven)! Starters were just average (probably 1 out of the 4 we had was tasty! Loved the bread basket, too! Well, the staff has great knowledge of the dishes but need more training on order taking. The ambience was NOT really WOW; and overall the restaurant gave me a high-end canteen feel - nothing spectacular! But, worth trying

The space and decoration was beautiful, but I'm quite speechless about the food.For the ease of decision making, the group of us just ordered the 88+ menu, and it was served in a large portion for share. The per-captia portion was really small, there was no innovation at all in terms of food, and the quality was very average. The service quality was not consistent across staffs. Some waitress would voluntarily pour tap water for us, whereas others might just bring us the bottle and left. Not super attentive in terms of cleaning up the space, once all dishes were there. A colleague's finished soup bowl stayed on the table until the end of the meal. I might say among everything, I like their toilet best
