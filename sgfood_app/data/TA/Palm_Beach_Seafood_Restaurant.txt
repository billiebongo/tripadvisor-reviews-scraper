Arriving for our 2pm booking we were told everything closed at 2.30pm so hurry up. We couldn't sit outside because that's only for evenings! The food we had was good but it was all too rushed. Maybe evenings are better there.
5
Best Crab and Seafood restaurant in Singapore with great view!! It’s little pricy but it worth it. Will be back for sure.
5
Enjoyed the evening. Stunning views!!! Should be a must. Near Merlion. near Finance district close cool
5
Good food and great view!
This is my first time to have dinner at Palm Beach Japanese TV show recommended.
That experience is better than what I imagine.
5
Brought my overseas friend here to try out what is dubbed as "Singapore's national dish" and was not disappointed. The food, view and ambience were all on point. To top off the gastronomic experience, the highlight of the meal was the service. I would like to especially commend Mr Jee Shien's for his patience and excellent service rendered, who took time to understand our tastes and preferences and gave great food recommendations! Not sure if you could choose your server, but recommend to look for him if you have any questions about local food and wine

After several folks recommending we go here for the Singapore Chili Crab, we decided to give it a try. We fortunately got an early reservation and were promptly sat at a front table. Our 2 year old was sleeping and the waitress brought two extra chairs over for him, built a nest with an extra table cloth - talk about service! This enabled us to enjoy our meal and have a real date night!After ordering, the waitress informed me I may have over ordered, which was appreciated. Thus I had her remove an appetizer. Thank goodness we did - we ended up with just the right amount of food!For dinner we shared the king prawn soup, beef skewers, black pepper crab, asparagus with scallop and the seafood fried rice. Everything was DELICIOUS!It is not the cheapest restaurant around, but we had a wonderful experience and would dine here again if in Singapore
5
I went to try this restaurant for lunch at 1 Fullerton Rd. You can make reservations in advance but I went as a walk in and they accommodated me well. Ordered the famous Chili Crab and no regrets, it was very tasty so much.Clean, very nice staffs, restaurant with a view and great location
5
This has always been my most voted restaurant for group dinner . The service received has never failed us from a good team from Palm Beach Seafood, Amanda, Andy, CK, Jew Shien, Sasa.. Thank you all for the impeccable service that you have have always showed to us. The good service, good team work with the great ambience and delicious food makes you A BIG STAR!! Keep up the good work!
5
So tasty. We had the chili crab, seafood rice and pomegranate chicken parcels. Most highly recommended.1) book. This place is crazy busy.2) ask for a table outside- the view is amazing. 3) chili crab is messy, don't wear white. It's cheaper elsewhere, but this is the bomb #getwhatyoupayfor4) this place sells seafood, nothing else. Don't take that person who "might eat salt and pepper calamari". Just saying.Have fun
5
This place is expensive but what a crab!! We came here on the recommendations of a Singaporean friend and were not disappointed. It definitely hurt the credit card (~80$/kg)! But definitely worth it. The chili crab was delicious! The crab meat is super sweet and tender. It was a great meal! Good for a once off/special occasion.
5
Tasty chilli crab with very good service of staffs! Besides very enjoyable views with marina bay sands for outdoor seats!
4
The food was generally good, although the chilli crab sauce was on the sweet side. They provide aprons and gloves, and even de-shell the claws on request. Price of crabs at $95 per kg was on the high side.
4
Had a very nice dinner this evening , especially the excellent service rendered by Ms Stella Sa Sa. She is most helpful and professional serving and treating her customers. Paul Teo (Diner)
4
Food is nice but find it overpriced.
Excellent view and location.
However, the dining time is quite rigid. They have 2 seatings and hence you either eat from 6pm to 8pm or from 830pm to 11pm.
5
Good view! Good location.reasonable price.
If I go to Singapore again, I will visit again!
Thank you
4
I visited this restaurant as part of a business trip. The location is superb with great views of the marina. The food was excellent, particularly notable was the chilli crab and the steamed grouper. An expensive location.
5
Came here to celebrate my wife's birthday. Our experience was nothing short of perfect. The ambience, the service , the food and especially the birthday cake presentation put the cherry on top. The staff were super friendly and nice. The amazing weather had a part to play too since we were seated outside and enjoyed a nice breezy evening.Thank you for this unforgettable experience Palm Beach
4
Brought 6 Japanese Guests to Palm Beach for seafood. The price are not cheap, but the service, ambience n location oversee the price. Highly recommend Chilli n Black Pepper Crab, they cook to perfection, and of course many more. Service is super the staff will provide you with a bib n help you to tie round your neck. This will prevent the gravy dripping and splashing your shirt/ blouse from being dirty. Good gestures, my guest found this amazing, funny and interesting. Enjoy good night view especially Merlion. Recommend this place if you want Marina Bay Sand n Merlion night view.

We booked the restaurant around one month. Requested outdoor seats and we were seated next to the pedestrians. View was a bit blocked by other tables, but it was still nice and could enjoy night show at 8pm. We asked if we could have seats closer to the bay. The answer was other tables booked earlier - so you might want to secure a good view seat by this way.Food was quite nice though price wasn’t too friendly - expected as the restaurant is at a supreme location. We ordered chilli crab, Satay and veggie. We requested a small crab - at 1.6kg, ~S$130. The crab is cooked nicely, and served with a basket of baked bread. We didn’t know the bread needs $4 - the server just served the crab together with bread and didn’t say anything, which made us believe it came along with the dish. Satay was above average. Sauces were good, especially the pineapple sauce. Throughout the dinner, servers occasionally helped us change the dirty plates. Restaurant also provided some friendly utensils like gloves and aprons - upon request. We expected a higher level of service, for example all staff could give customers simple background of the dishes and handle simple requests like refilling water. Overall the dinner was nice, with nice view and food. I would recommend my friends coming here but they would need to manage their expectations to the services
5
I was taken here by a couple of coworkers from the local office. We came for the chili crab (which was delicious) but everything about it was incredible. We had drunken prawns to start and they were cooked perfectly. The chili crab was great and I highly recommend eating it along with the sweet bread that is offered. Then at 8 and 9 across the water you are able to view the light show of the marina bay sands. Make sure you sit outside to fully appreciate that. Just an all around great experience.
5
Had the famous chili crab, it was messy but delicious. We also had some prawns, seafood fried rice and fried baby squid. Everything was delicious and the service was great. Extensive seafood menu. Made a reservation on Chope, super easy.
5
Excellent taste and location. We had fish with hongkong style, excellent taste. Services also good. Beside that fried rice and shrimp cook also yummy
4
The food was delicious. We reserved the outdoor seating with the view of MBS. We got to watch the laser show from our table.
4
We booked a dinner for 8 and had black pepper crab, creamy crab, seafood Hor fun, mee goreng and roast chicken. The food was generally good. However, despite our reservation being at 830pm, we only got our table at 845pm
2
Classic tourist trap. Perfect harbor location with great views. The menu has lots of choices but the prices are really high. We chose the signature Black Pepper Crab which was a chore to eat (they only deshelled to top) and a huge mess. It was decent but not for $112 USD! And that was a small portion. The other dishes were mediocre and not special.
4
We visited this place initially as a walk in but had no tables and had to return much later in the evening. Part of the reason is the number of covers they have. We number two but the table was laid for 6-8!!Food is excellent and the chilli crab wonderful - portions are large, so dont over order! Other dishes are ok - so their signature dish (chill crab) is what draws people and also bump up the price - this is GBP80 plus.Service is excellent and frequent plate refreshing to rid the table of crab shells etc, however we had to request additional napkins - we only had one each, whereas most of the food is designed to be eaten with fingers! They promptly came back with more but be aware - they charge for this!!!!Overall, excellent but would I return again - no, not at these prices. Its an experience rather than good food, which says it all really
1
All restaurants in the strip (Merlion Park) are just another tourist trap. You just pay for the location. Don't expect high quality food anywhere in this strip. The crab we had in Thailand with 1/10 of the price was much more fresh and delicious than chili crab we had here. Crab was rubbery and not fresh at all. All other dishes were just mediocre
5
Don’t know if it was the restaurant or the dish, but we ordered the black pepper crab and it was delicious. One of the best crab meals I’ve had in my life. The spiciness pf the pepper mixed with the sweetness of the crab was impressive. If your not into spicy food try the chilli crab, we tried the sauce and it was delicious.Restaurant is a bit expensive (but what’s not expensive in Singapore).Portion size one crab was enough for two, we ordered rice on the side and had a lot of leftovers.
5
I ordered chili and black pepper crabs. It was nice. Different from other crab restaurants, using MSG was inhibited. Furthermore, their service was really kind. Especially thanks to Ms. Jane Phee and her colleague, we could enjoy a nice dinner. They removed the shells for my old parents in law
4
I like that the restaurant called the day before to confirm my reservation. Palm Beach also made sure that a special request made during that conversation was recorded and accommodated for our meal. The ribs were wonderfully cooked, tender and falling off the bone like it was supposed to. The noodles were flavorful and cooked just right. And finally, for cheese lovers, the in-house special "Crab ala Singapura" is a unique take on combining our famous local crab with cheese. The service is much better compared to other seafood outlets even though the restaurant was full. But as with all seafood F&B outlets in general, and when located at tourist hotspots in particular, it is pricey
5
As the title says, quality food and friendly waiter. Minimum waiting time and quick response from waiter. Esp Jee Shien
4
Good view and reasonable price, except outdoor sitting a little cramp. Overall, a good place to recommend especially overseas guest
4
booked a table early as usual in order not to wait too long.
selection of a great variety of food and drinks. service was quick and attentive.
we sat outside so able to watch the light show at 8pm/9pm, very nice ambience!
5
The spicy crab and vermicelli were excellent. The service was prompt and courteous. We were very pleased with the size of the portions
5
We ordered a set menu for 8 people, the quality of the food was fresh, the flavors, outstanding. I specially liked the king prawn soup, honey tangy barramundi and the black pepper crab. Delicious.
1
Very bad attitude and facilities. When one friend of mine got out of the toilet and asked them how to go there they show me the bridge where some public toilets are there. When I asked them why I cannot go there they told me that it's out of service. When I asked them how they knew that they told me that it's all day like this. Very bad attitude..
5
I’m sure the crab is wonderful but we don’t eat crustaceans. However there were still plenty of other good things on the menu. We had the satays, barramundi and two vegetable dishes, followed up (for me anyway) with deep fried durian. They were all excellent, as was the location and the service
5
We had a 12 course banquet with beer and wine flowing. The crab is pretty spectacular and was the main focal point of the dishes though they were all really good. The slight breeze from the external air conditioning was welcome. It was very busy and the staff did a good job of keeping things moving. Definitely worth a visit. Has a great view of the river and the light show at the Marina Bay Sands hotel.
5
We celebrated my 59 birthday in Palm Beach Sea Food Restaurant. Please give our thanks to the Assistant Manager Andy Chin and others for the wonderful night scenery. We had an amazing time. The room was so comfortable, the food at Echo absolutely spectacular. All waitress was just wonderful. Looking forward to return in the future. What a great place
5
Visited this restaurant with family. Andy was very patient when we are indecisive of what to order, after hearing his recommendation we ordered their signature crab and black pepper crab. It is a good place to enjoy a great night view in the city. We are able to see the Spectra while we are dining, thanks to Andy who reminded us that there will be a laser show at 9pm. Will be back again when we are in singapore
2
Great view. Can see the marina laser show.
But few staff. Miss cheak.
Many time waiting..
This shop say youust eat finish and go out 2 hours.
But this shop. Price check time 30min..terrible.
And we dont drink beer. But this shop checked it
5
Food was excellent and service was great. Very friendly staff and attentive service. Food was delivered hot and not rushed so we had a really enjoyable time.
4
We enjoyed the Singapore chilli crab served at this restaurant, it was a large one and was really good. The restaurant is in a nice location at Marina bay.
4
Nice restaurant in great location.
The fried rice is fantastic. As are the bamboo clams.
The chilli crab was great too! Definitely a must eat when here
Limited wine by the glass menu however.
3
Food does not meet the expectation , with my many yeas of eating crab , the crab is not so fresh and taste of chili crab not that great .
2
They were happy to take us in at 9pm but the food was slow - so we were delayed in leaving. We ordered the signature crab and chili crab plus 2 beers $230 bucks. We were sitting outside and from 10 pm they were packing chairs cleaning floors around us, closed the toilet ... ..come on guys. The crab was sooo messy. We expected this but give us more napkins , we had to ask twice and call them over. Nice view outside .... their Wifi was not working when we asked
5
Went with my family. Total 8 people. Both the pepper and chilli crabs were super tasty. Big and meaty. During the ordering time, we were in a mess. Andy who was very helpful and knowledgeable came to assisted us. He knew actually how we should have a family meal with the right dishes. Making all the right choices for us without us overly spent! Thumbs up Palm Beach! Look forward again! Great food great staff
5
Went down to Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant with a group of friends. The service was excellent despite the busy evening. We ordered a few varieties of dishes which were recommended by the staff Andy. The most impressive dish that was recommended is the Golden Crab, tasty and full of meat. Would definitely come back for more with my friends
4
I went to the Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant with a large group. We ordered a variety of items, which were all tasty and well-prepared. The service was great for a busy evening. We got the chili crab and the pepper crab. The unanimous winner was the pepper crab. The chili crab was good but the flavor was too light. This is an excellent option for crab at the marina
4
We visited this restaurant end last month. Choose this place for dinner to host my Taiwanese friends due to the excellent location where you can have a good view of Marina Bay Sands. Highly recommend you to have dinner outside the restaurant at night, while enjoying the view of MBS. Good customer service. The staff were friendly and helpful, especially Andy, the Manager who recommended us some dishes. He was very attentive, he checked if we have enough food. Until today, my Taiwanese friends still thinking of the Chilli crabs. Definitely will be back to host oversea friends here.
5
Nearest restaurant to merlion,
chili and pepper mad crabs andbeer, I recommend.
Especially dinner is good atomosphere arround you.
5
i have came to this restaurant with my friends and indeed the food was real good. the staffs were friendly and helpful, especially Andy. i will come back for this with my family next time! highly recommended!
5
Had a wonderful dinner with great food and excellent customer service. Andy was very attentive and friendly. Thumbs up!
5
Had a great night dinner here & service staff Josh Tan & Stella xing were given a excellent service during our dinner and taking good care of us. Highly recommended. A superb view with nice food and nice people there.
5
One of the best crabs we have ever eaten in Singapore. Nice ambience. Very good service! Definitely be back for more!

It is a Team Lunch where 30% members are vegetarians! We asked if they had a vegetarian menu - they said no. A little disappointed. Anyway, we requested the tofu, vegetable, fried noodle and fried rice dishes to be cooked in vegetarian friendly way and for sharing. The Braised Tofu with Gingko Nuts and Green, Green Asparagus with Shimeji Mushroom and Fried Noodle were surprisingly delicious. The Vegetarian Fried Rice was a little too dry and hard, and I believe this dish can be cooked more creatively with better plant-based ingredients.In this era, it is very common for people who are vegetarian or have special dietary requirements dine together with other non-vegetarians. We often pick places that cater to our needs and offer alternative choices like creative vegetarian menus
5
excellent customer service. food really good. bun with meat tasted super. kailan crispy and nice. customer service attendant polite and recommends good dishes and serving size fit to your group.location very near merlion which is great. outside tables would be great at night but too hot in the noon
5
The only bottleneck at this place is the arrival / table allocation. Once words had been said to politely remind the desk staff that the booking was not made for fun and that 15 minutes is too long to wait in a crowd, everything was near perfect. Nice table, generous portions, great tastes but prices to match and this is not the place to critique e.g. gin & tonic 'tho the beer is good! And I haven't even mentioned the superb outlook
5
My group of visitors who were in SG for an offsite meeting were impressed by the service rendered by Andy and his team at Palm Beach on 9 Oct (Mon).The dishes served were delicious and everyone was raving about the food quality!Thank you once again for the hospitality and we will be back again
4
We had guests stay with us from the USA and wanted to treat them to their first chilli crab experience which packed a punch with views and great food. Palm Beach did not disappoint, as we watched the evening Marina Bay Sands shows from afar. Location-wise, we find this restaurant to be perfectly located and with the tourists passing by, it provided a great atmosphere as we dined on seafood outdoors. Highly recommend this and would come again as a satisfied customer
5
Greatest Pepper Crab I have ever had. It is a must. The service is even better. The atmosphere very cozy. Typical Singaporean.
5
Friendly service and delicious food
And it is good because you can enjoy a light walk after meals because the night view is good.
5
Was served pleasantly by the waitresses. View is nice and food taste great! Will recommend my friends to come here if they want to try seafood
5
The place is nice to have dinner. Service was good. Andy gave us honest recommendations on the food & beverage. We had pleasant dinner at Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant. Thank you Andy.
5
Food was fantastic and service equally outstanding! Stella Xing and her team was great. They worked tirelessly and always smiling under the supervision of Stella. Definitely worth a visit when you are in Singapore. Two thumbs up!
5
In my opnion the restaurant serve one of the best black pepper crab in Singapore. For appetiser, I will recommend Crispy Baby Squid, Mee Goreng noodle and Pomelo Fruit Drops dessert.
5
This restaurant is located at a very lovely location where you get a good view of the merlion, at certain timing you'll get to view the laser show too. The staff there are very polite ,friendly and provide good services despite how busy it was everytime I visit. The food they serve are will presented and taste even more excellent
4
~colleagues chose this place for a dinner with a visiting corporate executive, if you gotta use bibs and your hands to eat seafood, this is how you do it~I only did the eating there so cant remember much from my meal except that the one vegetarian in our group got a huge impressive fruit bowl (lookup the photo)certainly a good place to have seafood :
5
Well this is not my first visit to the restaurant. I guess it is time to do justice to the restaurant as the food and service so far are consistently good . Which are my favourite dishes , well there are more then 1 dishes of course , Black pepper crabs , cream crabs and my ultimate favour is coco lobo lobster ... tasty yet not over powering . As the rest , you just try it yourself . If the weather is cool enough, eat outside the restaurant while enjoying the view of MBS especially in the evening , you are accompany with good food and service . Definitely a place to recommend for social or business meal .
5
I hosted a dinner for my American boyfriend with my family. We were welcomed by a great and beautiful host Doris Chee who is the the operation manager in there. She has great personality and also arranged her staff , Poh Choo who is a sweet and polite girl to take care of us. The food were fresh and delicious and service was excellence that I must compliment.I will recommend other friends who want to host a great dinner with good ambiance for your guests from overseas and also friends who wish to have a place for good dinner and chill. Thumbs Up! You will never regret to choose this ideal location for money worth spending
5
Food and service were excellent!! Staff was friendly, food very delicious! Definitely will come back to visit again. Must try the most famous chilli crab with fried bun!
5
This place is located in Merlion park. I decided to eat special family dinner. The tast was also nice. My family was satisfied with dinner time.
5
Must order crab! My wife and I are both impressed with the crab (black pepper). Nice service makes the food better. And the location made us to review the light show of Sands Hotel across the river :)
5
Was craving for some seafood and Palm Beach came to mind. Decided to try their Award Winning Creamy Crab and it was yummy! A must-try other than their Chilli and Black Pepper crabs. Not to mention, the staff were as friendly as always!
1
We hardly ate food because of the woman who received the order. Look at the expressions of scorn when they receive their orders. They are expensive and not friendly. A place where Koreans should not come to visit
4
Food was great and service was good. We had a sampling of a number of dishes which the six of us really enjoyed. The crab and crispy duck we're my favorites.
4
This restaurant is stuck to the Mer-Lion famous fountain in Singapore. It is located by the Fullerton hotel on a lovely walkway. We unfortunately weren't able to sit out as it was closed due to the weather. The food was generally good, the restaurant was filled with locals and Asians. Food was good and the restaurant was upscale. They got my order wrong (I wanted grilled lobster and they assumed I asked for cheese), the restaurant was FREEZING (they turned off the AC after much fussing) and the food took ages to arrive - which is why its a 4 star.It is worth a visit if you are in the area for sure
5
The food in this resaturant is good that I went there twice while staying in Singapore for a week. The location is excellent right in the centre by the water opposite the Marina Bay hotel, so you can see their light shpw really well (at 8,9 and 10pm every day)the staff were excellent particularly our waiter Michael who advised us on teh menu and everythign he recommended was excellent. the prawn milk soup is to die for and if you like crab, it's he place to go. prices were reasonable too considering the location and quality of the food. Highly highly recommended, a must in Singapore
5
We were there to host our overseas business associates. This is the best place to showcase the local dish: chili crabs, drunken prawn and the steam fish. Palm beach has been our venue to host our VIP guests. We are happy to see some of the familiar service crew that always remember our names and preference. Keep up the good work and, we are always looking forward to come back again
5
Really nice food I've eaten in a long while, especially the black pepper crab. But best to book a reservation before coming ! Since the restaurant is really busy & fully booked. But the staff were nice to give us a table, but we would have to finish the food within an hour. Highly recommended to come & try 
4
The food and service was exceptional. The Chilli mud crab is a must. Staff were very friendly and professional. I look forward to returning upon my next visit to Singapore.
5
Food was fantastic. Service was top class. And they knew that my wife birthday and they even gave a complimentary dessert dish after we have finish everything. Well done. Will come again.
5
Great place to eat outside overlooking the bay and people watching. The sauces were truly amazing. Loved the Black Sauce Prawns and Hong Kong style fish. Delicious!! Be sure to get a reservation and sit outside.
4
Great location right at One Fullerton on Marina Bay near the Merlion fountain. The chili crab was a nice novelty. Love the Laksa, and the oysters were massive.
5
Don't have to mention again their signature crab. The BBQ fish recommended by restaurant staff is really nice! We tried otah which is also amazing! Staffs are all professional and helpful! We will definitely come back again!
5
Nice ambiance coupled with excellent service, especially thanx Michael and CK, makes this a good joint for their exellence food. Pepper Crab is a must have at Palms. It melts in your mouth and sauce is simply out of this world.
5
My first time here for dinner. It was quite full but finally we get a table. I would say food is Great and excellent services
5
tried the fabeled chili crab, do it once and order other dishes. Crab very good and experienced diners bought along plastic gloves to eat with, good idea. Check bill later they place items on your table and charge for it later, ie bread rolls extra napkins etc. excellent service though and would go for other dishes there once crab out of the way!
4
Situated overlooking Marina Bay just off Collyer Quay. Excellent seafood restaurant, with well cooked dishes. We shared a Chilli crab which is a house speciality, messy to eat but delicious.It is popular with visitors and can get busy, but the place has a good atmosphere. Best to sit out side and watch the light show in the bay
5
It was rainy day and we got there when the outdoor area was almost close, it is a shame; but it had an happy ending when its one of the staff kindly accepted us in the outdoor area to taste a super delicious food in a Michelin restaurant in front of the Marina Bay Sands hotel.We were with a 7 months old and opening a passage through the tables to get the table with the best view was something done by that nice staff. He patiently explained the foods one by one.The crab was mesmerizing and the noodle was the best ever. When I asked that young staff to call his manager for a compliment from his service, I realised HE IS THE MANAGER HIMSELF!The service, the food, . . ., and the view make it a must go in Singapore
4
The place and food was not bad. Just found the service a little slow maybe because they were under staffed. Overall it was good.
5
Food here is amazing and the view is breath taking. ร้านสวยมากคะ บรรยากาศดีมากๆเห็นวิวเมืองสิงค์โปร์ชัดเจน อาหารอร่อย บริการแบบสุดยอด แนะนำคะ
4
Nice ambience as it's near the Merlion & u will be spoilt for choices as there are many varieties of food to choose from; Fast service and reservation can be easily made. Highly recommended.
5
Nice restaurant located at riverside, have an excellent dinner with a group of friends, we got a river view table. Manager Andy were attentive, the service was busy but work well.
Delicious food, excellent service and beautiful view.
3
Raining outside, full house inside, not an ideal to sit outside for business dinner but it seemed good if you are to sit inside
5
was surprise to find that it's a Michelin restaurant now. the food is good and the service is super. been here before n this is a repeat trip. compare to last round, food is as good. still scoring a 5. but the service now is super good. which is hard to find in Singapore due to govt policy on employment. Keep it up
4
Arrived upon restaurant opening for lunch. Not really clear how they arrange tables but while the restaurant was empty, we were taken directly to the very back of the restaurant. Chili crab was very good but the staff do not give you any explanations on how to eat it or and really lack of hospitality. Just throwing you dishes on the table. Being at a touristy spot probably don't pressure them to be very welcoming.Overall, food was good but the staff make you feel not welcome. Would not recommend it particularly
5
When in Singapore the chili crab is a must! This restaurant is outstanding for chili crab. They off a wide range of seafood, but you must try the chili crab! We had an outstanding experience from start to finish. We were extremely luck and the manager, Michael was our waiter for the evening. His extensive knowledge of the menu and assistance was a huge benefit. He also helped us with the chili crab and served it up! The entire staff was warm and friendly and genuinely cared about our dining experience. A five star experience
5
I have just moved to Singapore and discovered the fabulous Palm Beach Seafood! The crab and food is stunning! Service is amazing too! Michael the Assistant Manager and his team will take such good care of you while enjoying a meal here. The view and outside tables are also pretty special! If you are looking for amazing Chill Crab and a fab place to take friends and family in a relaxed environment, head here! Thanks for always taking such good care of my guests and I! 
2
I am quite disappointed about the surrounding area at the open place. There's no fan provided and it was so hot. Crab not fresh and also the gravy standard very poor. Jumbo Seafood crab is much more fresher and nice.Price too expensive for the food and will not be going there again
5
I differnly bring here when my friends visiting Singapore.good food and perfect view. My favourite menu is bamboo clam. Thank you for always nice service!
5
This is nice food, nice view to see the mbs from restaurant.
The food so delicious and the staffs so friendly.
Should you come and try it, the best food is Chilli Crab and Pepper crab.
5
Straight on the marina, amazing view, kind staff and very quick! Best seafood ever !!! Amazing crab and prawns
5
i ordered chilli crab, fried rice, bun, armond prawn, bamboo clam and oyster. i dont like oyster but very good in this restaurant. i think here is better than jumbo.
and have very nice view.
4
It's a little salty
It was so warm enough to the end.
I want to go back if Iget the chance
But too expensive..
5
We had the drunken crab, drunken prawns and boiled crab. All of the seafood was extremely fresh and we were very pleased with our table which faced the Marina Bay Area.
3
Terrace seats have a nice view!. Chili Crab was a great. However, service was not all that. I suggest coming restaurant with family or couple!
4
The six of us decided to try this out this place knowing it is gonna cost us an arm and a leg.But having said that we were surprised that it was not that expensive. 2 1.4 kg crabs for S$218.00 Combination Platter (Otak, stem clams, fried squid and squid sashimi style) for S$60.00 and Drunken prawns for the same amount. We also had another 5 dishes for under S$20.00 Total less than S$600 plus drinks. Service was friendly and quick, Very attentive staff. This place faces the MBS which has a lazer show every hour on the hour, so, dining El Fresco would be nice.It is better you make reservations way ahead. When we arrived, there was long line waiting for tables. There are 2 seating's times for this place, one at 6.30 pm and the second at 8 pm. Taste wise it was ok, We did not find any difference between this place and the other famous seafood places
5
The experience we had was just awesome, the food is just simply delicious and excellent in all details such as presentation as well as texture of various seafood in the preparation. the service by Andy, the restaurant manager was excellent too, he took care of us exceptionally well so much so that I could not ask for anything more. I would definitely recommend anyone who wish to have seafood in Singapore to visit Palm Beach and look for Andy, the restaurant manager
4
Went there for dinner on a Tuesday night 8.30pm. It was packed. But later I realized everyone's waiting for tables outside. If you request for a table inside, you get one almost right away. Do it! We were a party of 5 and they sat us at a table large enough for 12... that's how much they didn't need their indoor tables. I highly recommend sitting indoors. The aircon is cool and the seats are so widely available.We ordered a crab bee hoon, bamboo clam stir-fried tanghoon, their special kailan and a butter prawn.The crab bee hoon comes with a minimum 2kg crab and standard cost is about $170++. It comes served in a large le creuset enamel pot and when dished out, splits into 5 very generous large bowls of noodles. You can choose thick or thin bee hoon. But if you want to have it remain soupy, thick bee hoon is recommended. The crab was very meaty and sweet and the soup was milky and so flavorful. I'm not usually a fan of crab bee hoon but this was very tasty.The bamboo clam tanghoon was also a winner. It's dry fried and a bit spicy. It's fried up with eggs, bean sprouts and a reasonable scattering of bamboo clam meat. We all really enjoyed this.Kailan was served with crispy fried seaweed and fried whole garlic cloves. A bit on the oily side but still tasty.The butter prawn was a mixed bag. Some enjoyed it, I didn't really. The small portion came with about 6 large shell-on prawns, dry stir fried w crispy fried brown bits of milk powder and curry leaves. I guess I was anticipating a creamy buttery sauce but this dish is sauce-less. That said, the prawn was not overcooked.Overally, our bill for 1 crab + 1 med veg + 1 small noodle + 1 small prawn + 1 alcoholic drink came out to about $60+ per person. Pretty reasonable I would say
3
Food was steady, service was appalling. The restaurant was busy, but staff we inexperienced got the order wrong and the bill took ages to arrive.
5
The reservation made via chope was surprising fast and easy. Scenery and view at palm beach was spectacular!
Food however was a let down.
3
If you want to eat seafood and don't want to travel to East Coast, this is the place to go.
Chilli crab is good here.
The rest of the dishes are average.
5
Reasonable pricing, great food & excellent service by all the friendly staffs especially Joanna Chua. She is very service oriented to our needs and always carry a beautiful smile.Definitely looking forward to come back to Palm Beach for dinning again!
3
The tables are overbooked. We had to wait for 15min despite a reservation. The first wave of customers refuse to leave. Food was acceptable and the view was lovely. But not an enjoyable dining experience. Good to bring tourist friends
5
Food was really tasty, though the crab was expensive. The staff, esp ms Yeow/Leow, were attentive and great. V enjoyable and tasty meal, good, accessible place to have good Chili crab in sg if you're visiting or bringing a visitor around. Cereal prawns also tasty.
4
Their Pepper Crab and chilli crab are great! And all the other food is brilliant too. The best part is the outdoor seating overlooking the Merlion and the Marina Bay Sands and the water.
3
 Ordered the Chilli crab and few other dishes and was disappointed esp with the Chilli crab . The crab served didn't taste fresh and the gravy was at most average in taste. I have certainly tasted more flavourful gravy and better crabs at other seafood restaurants in Singapore.  Service was so-so but the view and atmosphere was certainly good

Sadly many restaurants in high traffic tourist areas know they will get customer numbers without trying very hard. This is one of those places. We arrived for lunch and were happy to sit outside on the marina deck but were told only inside was open. So we ventured inside to a half empty restaurant and placed next to a family with a couple of screaming kids. As there were many empty tables we thought we'd wait and when a waiter approached we would ask for table away from the rowdy kids. And we waited........... and waited........then waited a little longer. Waiters poured tea and circulated around the few occupied tables, but left us to enjoy our own company. Never mind a drink order on this typically warm Singapore day..... they seemed to say "just wait while we choose to get around to you". Mmmmm.....nahhh, we don't wait while you fluff about doing nothing in particular, exercising your arrogant right to offer little or no service. We love restaurants that want your business and enjoy serving. Palm Beach just didn't bother. So we exercised our right to walk out
4
Very good food especially the black pepper crab. We ordered black pepper crab and chilli crab with other dishes, they were good and the crab is very meaty. However the Mango Pomelo was a disappointment, it came with many jelly bits and a huge ball of ice. Ended up our guests from abroad just took a few spoons and decided to leave it untouched
5
This has been a very memorable experience dining at this restaurant. Wonderful food and excellent services with very helpful staff.
4
Tried recommended almond cereal prawns, they were awesome, totally great recommendation. Thanks Yiow Mei Wei. Attentive staff and good service overall. A bit pricey but worth the views.
2
Superior place. Good food. But terrible service. Waiters were too intrusive. Besides popular chili crab was substituded to pepper crab by mistake and waiter done nothing about it
5
Had a great experience at Palm Beach. The food was delicious and service was prompt and friendly. Cap it off with the beautiful view of Marina Bay! This is the place to be to show off the beautiful taste and sights of Singapore
5
i had my sister and her family visiting. Couldn't have been happier with the meal.The food was delicious. The service was somewhat slow, particularly given they were not overly busy on the Monday night, but it was friendly service!
4
We rocked up on a Saturday night and it was both hot and noisy, but party central too. We had an outside table but it was sweaty and REALLY noisy. They moved us indoors at the first opportunity. Food, especially the child crab, were delicious and the location is excellent with views over to MBS.
5
I've been to Palm Beach Seafood twice now, four years apart, and both times I have been absolutely blown-away by the excellence of their food, service and views. Located right across from the Marina Bay Sands hotel creating a wonderful spot for an evening meal and the light show, Palm Beach Seafood is a perfect choice for a memorable meal! The chili crab is amazing, the almond prawns fantastic, and all side dishes we ordered were fresh and flavorful. The staff was great with making recommendations on not only what to order but how much. I would definitely eat here again on our next trip to Singapore and highly recommend it
5
Decided to have dinner nearby the Fullerton bay and was surprise & lucky to get a table the very last min. The food was excellent as well as the attentive service by Yeow who served at our table. She is very patient and provides good advice of the menu. We truly enjoy our dinner as well as the night scene of Marina Bay
4
I recommend eating at the outside dining area rather than inside. It offers amazing views of Marina Bay and the spectacular Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The seafood is fresh and excellent. I recommend one of the fish dishes with several side dishes. The wait staff was a bit confused, but friendly. I found the prices to be a bit expensive compared to comparable restaurants
3
Requested an indoor quiet nice seating..we were seated at a corner infront of the fish tank..where many parents bring their kids over to look at the fishes Asked staff if there is any wild caught fish available..two staffs with question marks..went in n out of the kitchen a few times to tell me there isn't (not well-knowledged but at least helpful). Was told the promfet will be 128bucks, but wasn't told it's a huge fish. We are 3pax, but tt fish can feed a table of up to 8pax. Ordered teochew style steam for the promfet, its soo salty tt I was closed to tearing when I tasted the sauce/soup (I dunno wat is tt actualli should be called). The Tofu ingredient was absent. They offered to steam the tofu n bring it out or take the fish back to redo ( as everyone know, re-steaming the fish will make the meat tough) soo we ask for them to just give us the tofu separately ( which was onli brought out after we finish the fish) Lastly, I dunno if it's ok that The promfet still hav gills in them. Shldnt the gills be clean away before cooking it
3
This is a good location in Singapore but poor service (chaotic actually). Food ok though Pepper and chilli crab good standard. Wine list was good and reasonable prices considering Singapore .
4
Nice view & Great Services👍👍👍
Strongly recommended the dessert
And the chillicrab will be regret if you never order it~^^
2
No food ambience for european people, the service wasn't great, we always had to ask for order food and drinks. The view is nice, the food good but without side dishes.
4
Seafood was fresh. The cereal prawns was excellent! The staff could have been better organised on table arrangements.
5
I'm surprised by the earlier negative reviews because I have had an enjoyable dinner yesterday evening. We were seated outdoor, closest to the riverfront. However, we had to wait for a while but it was all worth it. My wife and I watched the light show while drinking the red wine. Thank you to the kind female staff who advised us on the soup while taking our order. We were not very sure of the appropriate portion to order, but she was friendly enough to inform us later. The food was lovely and the staff were attentive. We will be back again during our next visit
5
So lucky because i was arranged the best place outside, looking out to the Marina bay sand. Enjoy dinner with big chili crab (1,5kgs), watch water music, experience the most beautiful, airy and central nature in Singapore. The food here is taste-perfect: chilli crab, asparagus steak shells..
1
We couldn't get in earlier than 8pm arrive on time to be told sit over there & wait. We sat for 10 minutes watching them take other people who arrived after us to tables. We complained n was rudely told we would get next available. Took a long time for a waiter to come near us to order & get drinks but UNBELIEVABLY the Chilli Crab comes out first followed by entree/appetizer. I told them we couldn't possibly eat a whole Chilli Crab & the entree remain warm we wouldn't accept it so they rudely took entrees away. Chilli Crab was not like it used to be didn't taste freshly cooked & I felt sick all night. We used to go here twice a year when in Singapore & recommend to many people we won't be doing that again
1
To start with, we came at around 6 and it was still empty but they gave us one food and drink menu for 4 of us, just dropped it and left. When I saw staff again I've asked to bring 3 more and he looked at me surprisingly, like I've asked something unusual. He brought menus and left.Then we ordered drinks, they brought only 3, forgetting mine, I've reminded and then waited for another 10 minutes, then reminded again, then waited another 5 minutes before they brought it to me eventually. No apologizing at all. Like it is normal.Then, half of us ordered fish, which was very dry and tasteless. I've ordered crab that I was waiting for an hour, even though I was told it takes 30 minutes.My father does not eat with chopsticks but was never offered an European cutlery until we asked. No one came to check if we had a good food or wanted to order something else until we left.... Such a disappointing and disrespectful experience, I was unlucky to choose this place for my birthday, next time I'll do a better research
5
I booked a table online before travelling to Singapore for the second time, and it did not disappoint me. The staff were excellent and being a special occasion for us, we were presented with a table on the front row i.e. nearest to the 'Marina Bay Hotel' and just before the first light show from this hotel. Food excellent, we were provided with bibs to crack the crab ourselves. A brilliant experience for our special evening
5
Don't know if its the best peppered crab, since its my first one ever, but man was it delicious! My wife and I ate a 1.8 kg crab. Although it is a bit expensive it is worth every penny. Even if your hungry don't order anything else, a crab that size is more than enough for 2.
4
I requested by terace seat. Its good.
Order Chili club , kankon , sea food rice.
Chili club was good teast. Bad i didnt like sea food rice.
5
Super view of the Fullerton and Marina Bay. Very high quality local seafood ie Chilli crab, black pepper crab and buns among others! Must try to have a very local Singapore taste if it's your first visit to this sunny island.
4
2.2kg crab as big as a palm! Althought its very ex, but its worthwhile with the location and atmosphere!
1
Starter was saturated with garlic.
Glass was dirty.
We ordered main course of carb's legs and they brought 1 portion instead of 2. Didn't taste nice.
Very poor indeed.
4
I had a superb and delicious pepper crab! Highly recommended. Good and friendly staff. I will com back again for sure.
5
Great selection of food and a must to have the chilli crab! Fun atmosphere inside and a lovely view outside. The staff were happy to help with the cracking of the crab to get to the meat!
1
I visited there for dinner with my friends.
The food and atmosphere was great!!
However, when one staff distributed the food, I was soiled my clothes and never apologized.
3
Went with the extended family- 7 of us in total. Had an assortment of dishes and a bottle of Aussie Chardonnay. Seafood fried rice was terrible. Very dry and I think it may have been cooked somewhere in the vicinity of a prawn but that was about it. Crabs were big at about 1.6kg and $125 each. Had the ubiquitous chili crab which was good but I have had better for much less. The Black Pepper crab was ok- unfortunately they don't offer the white pepper version which I think goes better with the crab. Oto Oto was very tasty and a nice consistency. Kan Kong with cuttlefish was the pick of the vegetable dishes we had. Cost $600
5
Excellent food and large variety. The chilly crab is the best. Try the black pepper crab as well. Kig prawn soup is sublime .Service top notch. I am an Asian food person so I asked to see the kitchen. Without hesitation they escorted me to the back. I can say it is well run and above all it is CLEAN and SPOTLESS
5
I went there with my partner and had the creamy crab. It was fantastic and a great recommendation by our server, Stella. We were seated outdoor facing Marina Sands so we also had a great view. The cherry on top of the day was when another server, Amanda (if not mistaken) attended to us to help us fully deshell our crab and also spoke to us in Korean for our convenience. Overall, it was a great night with awesome food and fantastic service. Kudos to Palm Beach for your fantastic food and staffs.
4
Great food, great service, great location. My wife had the Singapore chilli crab which was very good, me... I had the Singapore pepper crab which I thought was better.
5
Nice meal with lots of different options. The crab was excellent but a bit messy but I guess that is part of the fun
3
Food here is passable, but nothing to shout about. Chilli crab was run of the mill. Mee goreng was better than expected. Nice view though.
2
We have been to palm beach a handful of times in the past 2 years. The previous visits were very good service and food quality (we love the black pepper crab). However, during our last two visits in the span of 3 weeks, our very expensive crabs came out warm and not piping hot from the wok (even after we requested to make sure our crab came out hot to our table). In addition, the wait staff were terrible. Servers were not actively approaching our table, was hard to catch their eye, kept rushing off before we could finish making requests, etc. We were very disappointed and will be looking for a new place to get black pepper crab.
5
What could be better than having a Singaporean favorite with a stunning view on Marina Bay? We made a reservation, but since they were fully booked, we were seated inside. Despite this, the hostess was very keen on putting us on the waiting list for outdoors, and eventually we were seated on a beautiful terrace. The menu offers many local classic seafood varieties and specialties, but many of them had no prices (market prices), so be aware of that before ordering. After we placed the order, we were offered nice appetizers on house - deep fried fish skin and spicy cucumber salad. Chili crab was succulent and delicious, although the sauce was a bit sweeter than in other places we tried. The fish was fresh and cooked very well - crispy outside and soft inside. Their fried noodles and greens were also fantastic. The main thing is that the portions are humongous just like the bill. But considering the quality and taste along with great and friendly service, the entire experience was totally worth it
5
I reserved the dinner online 1 day before having meal, so there was few selection for the time. I went there at the first day of my trip on 19 Apr. I went there a little bit late but still be there before 20:45, as I reserved for 20:30, 15 mins allowance for late. As I made a reservation online, I requested for a outdoor harbour view seat, which was really arranged for me and girlfriend. It surprised me a lot that they rushed my requested table for me immediately after the previous guest finished their meal. On the other hand, the waiter and waitress were very polite with talking different languages and recommanded us their signature dishes. We finally ordered a soup, scallops and black paper crab, which were really enough for us. The taste of the foods were really good and we could try the traditional flavor of singaporean. We love the food and place of the dinner and we definate will go again if we visit singapore in the future
3
There's no doubt that there are many places in Singapore that serve Chili crab, but it is worth checking out Palm Beach for a couple of reasons: Firstly - the view of the bay Secondly - for the variations of the dish that they prepare. If you have enjoyed the chili crab (which personally, I would rename sweet garlicky crab, but there you go) try their other "drier" (i.e. served without a thick sauce) crab dishes such as the pepper crab and the salt egg crab. Both are awesome. As other reviewers point out, it is expensive and service isn't always the fastest. TIPS: - Don't mess around ordering anything fancy to drink - just wash it down with a Tiger beer- Wear a bib!- Order the fried buns to soak up the sauce- Be prepared to get messy! - Enjoy
2
The chilli crab here is not unlike any other chilicrab in Singapore. Sweet. Spicy and savoury. Very delicious indeed... But be prepared to pay very high prices. We spend an exorbitant 400 for a party of 3 persons. Which was out of our budget. The menu is a little deceptiv
4
Decided to visit this restaurant to sample Chilli Crab. We were not disappointed. We booked a table ahead of time as this restaurant is a popular choice for a lot of visitors. We did have an extended wait despite this, but we were offered a drink on the house to compensate. The outside tables offer great views, but the inside tables benefit from aircon - take your choice :-). The crab is sold Market Price (can be a little disconcerting when ordering) but the waiter was more able to give us a heads up on the expected price before we confirmed the order. We also ordered seafood rice, and some deep fried barramundi. All excellent. The menu is extensive and caters for all price points, but if you're looking for a good option to experience one of Singapore's signature dishes then this should be on your list of possibles. We will return on our next visit
4
Book early or be prepared to wait for quite a while. Palm Beach Seafood - along with a couple of other local seafood places - are well known and normally booked out. We made a last minute decision to go and ended up in a cocktail bar next door for an hour while we waited for a table. The dishes are standard Singapore seafood fare but well prepared and very tasty. Our favourite is the Pepper Crab - expensive but a worthwhile treat once in a while
4
Went to eat Singapore chili crab. The waitress told us it was small, so we ordered the black pepper one too, which we preferred. The chilli crab was a bit sweet
5
We sat outside with a wonderful view of the harbour. The service was excellent, and the food is good overall. A great atmosphere.
5
Food was serve hot and it's nice,will visit again,nice view at night after meal can have a stroll or have a beer beside a pub
4
The food and ambience was good. However the reservation timings allowed was 1830 and 2030. Don't understand why it's so restrictive.
5
Truly loved their spicy crab: I tried both the white pepper and the chilly crab, both delicious. Gorgeous overview of the bay
4
Pleasantly surprised we had our CNY company dinner and the food was better than expected for a large group. Most of the dishes are a twist on traditional CNY dishes. Haven't had the rest of the menu yet, but would visit again
4
Made online reservations via "Chope" just 2 hours prior to dinner and before the restaurant opened. The reservation was for 6:00. We had the option of inside or outside. Chose inside and was given a large table in the back for 2 people. Decided to switch to outside. It was a hot and humid day, but the night was cooling off quickly next to the water. Nice table next to the rail with a good view of the water and city center. We had a few visitors on the table in the form of small ants but we were outside next to the foliage. Traveling is all about the adventure. Started with the college pitcher of Tiger beer. Nice relief from the heat and a long 4 mile walk from the Hotel to Chinatown, Arab street and to Palm Beach. Ordered the Spicy Crab, shrimp and a noodle dish. The waiter placed a bib around our necks and delivered the food. The Spicy Crab was beautiful and delicious. The shrimp stuck to the shell making it difficult to peel. The noodles were perfect. Back to the bib. The Crab was work. I shell Dungeness crab since I was a kid on the coast in Oregon but now I just shop for it at Costco. Nothing prepared me for the battle at hand. The combination of spicy sauce and rock hard shells made it messy and difficult. Forget the shell crackers. My hands were covered in sauce and the crackers just slipped out of my hands. Thus, I continued to battle in hand to hand combat. Not sure who won the battle, I had sauce all over the table cloth and half a dozen napkins. Although I walked away and the crab was carried off. The price for the crab was $125 Singapore. I assume they also had a battle with the beast and included a charge for hazard pay. We had a great time. The service was excellent. I will check this one off my bucket list and avoid the mess in the future. I was impressed with the table of locals next to me. They were using chop sticks on the Spicy Crab and their first few attempts at that 8 legged beast was civilized and clean.

When I entertain guests, I like to bring them to Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant. The seafood is excellent and the view is spectacular. You are just seated next door to the Merlion! And the restaurant overlooks the Marina Bay Singapore.A special THANK YOU to the restaurant supervisor, Max who personally helped us peel-off/remove all the crab shells so that we could enjoy eating the crab meat without dirtying our hands!!BEST SERVICE I HAVE RECEIVED - EVER - FROM A SEAFOOD RESTAURANT!!Max, you are the best advertisement for Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant
4
Make a reservation. We had the pepper crab 2 Kg , it was delicious. The appitiser however was terrible. We ordered the baby fried squid, came out cold. Felt like it was fried earlier, reheated and sent out. The other items going out looked better. We sat outside and enjoyed the evening
4
I have tried many Chili Crab dishes in many different restaurants of Singapore before, but Palm Beach Seafood's one really go for the Champion. All the Crabs are so chunky and yummy. All other dishes also appeal to me, in terms of both the presentation and taste.The location is also prime, since you can view the nightly laser light show around Marina Bay. The environment is bright and clean, not too crowded, for both indoor and outdoor area.The waiting time for a table seems long, even you have made reservation, especially it is quite typical in Singapore during meals' peak hours, but really worth to try, if you are not too hurry.Overall the pricing is relatively at the higher end, but once you factored in the food quality and the atmosphere of the show you can watch outdoor, it is really worth to enjoy a meal at Palm Beach.Bon AppetiteV

Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant @ 1 Fullerton is located opposite Marina Bay Sands Hotel and just next to the Merlion. Great ambience, good service and fresh seafood which left a memorable seafood dining experience for my family!
2
Fabulous view. Had a booking for 2030. Waited 20 minutes for table. Expensive as is alcohol. Refresher towels on table were actually charged on your bill. No serviettes provided.
My fish was under cooked. Meat very tasty. Small portions.
Friendly staff.
4
Great for tasting local food, the food in this country is expensive but it worth the experience, chili crab is a must, and fish also, the location is excellent please ask a table in the terrace and enjoy the great views
4
We were a family with 4 persons. We ordered chili crap and sea food fried rice and bun. Chili crap was best. It was not that spicy and even children could enjoyed it. However it was a litte pricy.
3
Shrimp was fresh, however, crab is not as fresh as shrimp.
View is good. Enjoy the light show from Marina Sand while eating your dinner.
2
The view was totally wonderful, The Merlion is just near our seat.The waiters were busy but very considerate.However, the most part we expected——the crab, truely made us disappointed.We ordered a 2kg crab which separated in two part for 2 flavor, one black pepper and one chili. The black pepper part was really great, it was fresh and tasty. But the chili crab was not fresh, and the crab shells in two dishes can not even put in one, seems they were from 2 different crab, and the small one is not good, not fresh.We asked the waiter to deal with this problem, but it's a pity we don't feel the discount is the best solution. I'd rather ate the best food instead of having the discount.
4
food was really good - service was a bit clumsy - surprising for a place that is supposed to be this good - with food dropped on the table, and twice a chili crab brought to the table instead of the pepper crab we ordered. terrace is nice - last time i was there we sat outside, this time inside. Place has been remodeled, but the male toilets are really old and gross. Pepper crab is among the best in Singapore according to me - good round taste and not too spicy - but this one was really expensive (weight wise). Wine list is quite good but fairly pricy too - but this is singapore. At the end of the day, the location is great right next to the Merlion, the crabs are great - also try the drunken shrimp, quite nice here - and you can have a drink at overeasy right next door afterward
3
Our party of four wanted a light lunch so we only ordered four dishes. The baby squid was very sweet but crunchy. The almond prawns were tasty and well cooked as was the mixed satay (beef & chicken). The seafood rice was plentiful and reasonable but the overall price of S$160 was in part reflected by the cost of a pitcher of beer (S$40) and an orange juice (S$12). The service was friendly and prompt
4
It is a MUST to eat the Lamb Rack and bamboo clam in Palm Beach. The lamb rack is tender and juicy.. 2 pieces are not enough for your meal.. yummy. Bamboo clam steamed with chopped garlic.. erm.. if you like garlic.. yes. You would love it so much, due to the bamboo clam steamed with chopped garlic to enhance the flavor but not branded garlic .. yummy.. Well.. I like the way the staff describe the foods there.. due to what they describe is totally the same.. Good job..
5
I know this was going to be messy when I saw the huge bibs and rubber gloves on the customers...I was right BUT what a treat... Chilli Crab at its best and in a great setting. Service was good and surround by great bars for a pre or after drin
5
Delicious , fusion sea food . And good wine .
The guy, Max, treated us as kings and 👑 queen
Recommended 👍🏾
5
what an amazing restaurant , real treat , the food is very creative m tasty , great service , great atmosphere
4
I made a reservation here and had a nice seat with awesome view. It made unforgettable memory for us.
5
the chili club is so good!!
i requested terrace seat,it had nice view.
in front of marina bay sands !!
4
Very nice chilli crab at this place, and also a nice view over MBS. If you are not picky about the view I think I would have chosen long beach sea food over this one and also over JUMBO, if chilli crab is the goal.
4
Crab, meat and soup is good quality. But serving is not soft, not deliver tea, late deliver Crab which is main food even though after rice. Location is perfect in middle of Merion. But they need to up garde service attitude and peocedure.
4
One of the best spot with great view of Sands hotel and marina bay.
Foods are also great specially chilly clab. Don't miss bun along with clab sause.
5
The atmosphere in this restaurant is so relax and the service staff was so attentive when we needed some assist to deshell the crab. Thanks for the food and excellent service from you guys!! Keep that up.
4
Air con dining room with great view of MBS - what a comfy way to savour chilli, black pepper and other crab dishes. They also have other nice offerings, eg. soup, mini yam with abalone, even a fresh 'sashimi' platter with salmon, oyster, prawns, and squid. Understandably, what they provide to vegetarians is quite limited and boring. Service is more 'elegant' than the typical Long Beach, Jumbo outlets
5
Eating el fresco is the best way to eat at this restaurant as opposed to eating within the well appointed restaurant.We chose a table outside and looking over the harbour which has tremendous views. We can recommend the chilli crab which is rich in in red gravy, spices and sweet. It is without doubt a local delicacy worth trying.The staff are welcoming and friendly with all tables being clean and smart. The cutlery was very clean which offers a confidence there is unlikely to be a case of food poisoning. Definitely worth a visit but the gin and tonics are very expensive and small on measures. Go for the Tiger beer which is cheaper but full of flavour
3
The location of this restaurant is great as it is in CBD. You can have local seafood without having to travel to the East Coast.
Food is ok and so is the service.
View is great.
5
Business dinner here great views being so close to the water also can watch the laser light show at the Marina Bay Sands while you are having dinner. The steamed whole fish is great and the broth makes a wonderful soup
4
Located in the tourist area at One Fullerton, their service was ok, dishes were of big portion, we came out with satisfied full stomach. Of the many dishes we ate, I liked the Chilli Crab and the Bobo Chacha with Coconut Ice Cream.
4
I had their seafood dishes many years ago since I was a kid..
Strongly recommend their black sauce prawn, the prawn is really tender and juicy.
It is good with deep hot fried mantou together with the black sauce.

Heavy rain resulted in us shelving our plans to walk to a hawkers market for our evening meal. We asked Gideon, the concierge at our hotel - the Conrad Centennial Singapore - and he suggested and made a reservation for us for that evening at Palm Beach Seafood. We took a short taxi ride, arrived on time for our booking and were seated immediately. This location is great for relaxed evening dining as it is located next to the iconic Merlion Fountain. The alfresco dining area has a stunning, picturesque view of Marina Bay and the Marina Bay Sands, which has an evening light and sound show which started part-way through our meal. We were able to experience this amazing entertainment by turning our seats sideways to watch it, after which we returned to eating our delicious meal. The extensive menu has over 100 items to choose from. Coming from Australia, and having no descriptions in the menu, we were undecided as to what to choose. Max, who was in charge of the outdoor area, came to our assistance and was extremely helpful in advising us of items we would enjoy. His assistance was invaluable and our meal was totally delicious, ending with the amazing coconut ice-cream.There is a small but well selected wine list, with something to appeal to every taste - our choice was a very good New Zealand pinot noir, which was perfect.After dining, we walked back to the hotel, well satisfied after a great evening and the assistance from Gideon. We would like to visit here again when we return to Singapore

We made a reservation at the restaurant on the advice of the concierge at the Ritz Carlton Hotel.The reservation was for 8 people at 8pm. We arrived a couple of minutes early and we're informed that there were people on our table finishing their desserts so we would need to wait a few minutes. We stood outside the restaurant for what ended up being 40minutes until our table was available.When we were eventually seated, a couple of appetiser dishes were placed in the middle of the table. We did not like them so they were not eaten. We were not asked whether we wanted these dishes they were just put on the table so we assumed they were complimentary, however they charged us for these dishes that we never ordered or ate!Then we ordered chilli crab, and asked for the male crabs. Half an hour later the waiter comes to our table to tell us that she has managed to get female crabs for us as we requested. We said, no we wanted male crabs and were advised that we now need to have the female.The crabs were soggy in texture and almost inedible. The rice had a strange almost soap type flavour and of all the dishes we ordered that evening there wasn't one that tasted any good.After all of this we ended up paying for more our dinner than we did for the Michelin star restaurant we ate at the previous night.Overall it was very disappointing and I would never return

The restaurant has a very good location close to Singapore’s Merlion at the promenade, where you can see parts of the business district up to the Singapore Flyer and Esplanade. We’ve been there with a large group for dinner and had some small dishes to start followed amongst others the Pepper Crabs and the Chilli Crabs, a specialty at this place. All the seafood dishes ordered looked very good and tasted very good. Staff OK but service not that impressive. Besides beer, they also have a wine card for white’s and red’s which was OK. All in all a good place if you’ve a business dinner, reasonable priced for the quality of F&B’

Due to its location, the restaurant was packed. We were told we could only book for 2 at 8.30 but when we walked past at 8pm there were many empty tables. The Singapore Chilli crab was a specialty . It was a meal in itself but at Sin$110 it wasn;'t cheap. Other dishes were pleasant but nothing special and probably overpriced. The tables were large and well spaced but it was still very noisy. The staff were efficient but not particularly friendly. Overall, a very average experience

I was here for have the black pepper crab last week. It is really nice and spicy, but the spicyness is just nice to me, the staff is really kind, he knows I am only alone, then he offered me the smallest crab there have.. The portioning is not really much while I still can have some other dishes.. The staff are friendly too and good to recommend food..

i had my dinner with my family here last night.which is just beside merlion at 1 fullerton, we were enjoy the good view while having our dinner, their food and service are great.well, they are charging for wet towel, is ok, it is worth it .thanks

This restaurant provides good customer services and delicious crab. This is not the first time I come and will come again.

Waiter was in training with senior person showing how to serve wine.
Rushed dinner and food went cold with dishes simply piled up.
Overpriced

Great location for relaxed dinner by water. Light and music show in background was fun too! Food was very good Singapore style seafood- really enjoyed crab and crispy squid. Waiters were good and cared about the service. Fun night

We'd had chill crab at Newton Circus back in the 80's, when it was probably at its most authentic. We've avoided it since, fearing we couldn't replicate the experience. But this trip we decided to give it a go, so read all the review to find the right place. We thought we had found it, but we were wrong. This was awful; terrible service, almost inedible squid (we ate it as the main took so long) and a cold but expensive crab. I fear that good chilli crab is gon

What a great location.....what a disappointing affair. Terrible selection, totally unappealing Crab.....jumbo crab River point is whey whey more interesting as far as Singapore crab. Paul Salter from Melbourne Australia told me it was the best meal he had and I think it was my Worst

I have to say sincerely the foods are great and the atmosphere plus view are amazing.However frankly speaking a bit tough as they have a minimum spending to hit on this special occasion. Lucky they have the lobster promotion deal which makes us hit the minimum. Anyway tips to people who want to eat here please make sure call for a booking before coming down. I make sure i get to see the fireworks and laser show which is the 2nd seating timing. Important tips they have turn around table so make sure choose the timing which you want and you are most comfortable with. If you request the 2nd timing please do not get agitated easily why you are not place to sit. There are some factors we need to be considerate the first seating guests have not go even they inform them but do talk to the host and they will try to give you complimentary drinks while waiting. I have observe they hire alot of indians staffs so please make sure if you cant talk well or you are a foreigners use google translator app and write what you want to have and show them to prevent miscommunication problems. The indians staffs are nice and helpful and i wont discriminate or penalise them for not understanding me as they are here for work so be more patient and kind

Located at one Fullerton which is good tourist sight, this restaurant offers good black pepper crab. Sometimes it is too noisy but if you sit by window, others' voice is not so annoying.Service is good, a bit pricey though, but crab is one of the expensive dish in Singapore anyways
4
Wonderful dish of a giant tasty chili crab we could enjoy with "full hands". Price is expensive and pay attention because what the waiter is telling you is without tax and service (17% addition). Overall nice experience but be prepared with your wallet at the end

I believe I have rated this restaurant in the past, but I felt that an updated review would be useful for those considering this restaurant.This location is a great location for evening dining as it is right in the heart of the marina bay area. Located next to the iconic merlion makes it very accessible and convenient. You can enjoy the area before and after dinner. brought a group of 11 colleagues for dinner. The overall experience of the seafood is good, the pepper crab is still as good but I am a little disappointed with the chilli crab compared to the past. what I felt during the experience that the restaurant have become so experienced in understanding the customer needs and preference, the overall process becomes very mechanical and the sense of going through a very expensive fast food process is very evident. I saw that they would cook chilly crab in bulk and distribute to many different tables all at the same time. For a dish that cost you more than S$200/-, it does not feel authentic anymore. The food is a lot more expensive compared to the past one to two years which does not make sense. Palm Beach needs to review their process of preparing good food as I am definitely not returning after this experience. It is not worth paying such prices for fast food style chilli crab. But if it is your first time, the food is still better than most other seafood restaurants nearby

My wife, two children and I ate dinner at the Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant in June 2016. The restaurant is located close to the Merlion statue and the Singapore river cruise. The restaurant had indoor and outdoor seating. We sat indoors. We had fish and other dishes. The fish was quite good but I do not remember what kind we had. I would recommend this restaurant if your objective is to see the Merlion statue and take the Singapore river cruise
4
Food are very fresh. Service also not bad. Overall, we are satisfied. Will visit again with friends.
4
Nice view seated (outdoor) very near to Merlion and opposite is the iconic Marina Bay Sands. Service was very good as they clear your plates when it is messy. Friendly crew and work pretty efficiently with good speed and attentiveness.
5
This is my favorite place for black peppered crab. The taste is perfect!! Excellent service!! Maybe a little more on the expensive end, but worth the price. Highly recommended!!

Food was good. Got the set dinner for 8 persons. Including drinks came to sgd800. Portions could be bigger. Service was good and attentive
5
Service great, food excellent view wonderful we came with Friend twice in 3 days it was that good. Enjoy

i visited with my friend.
food, service was so nice. but i had to wait long time. very busy.
if i go to singapore again, i will vist palm beach again

Received a warm welcome at the reception and the wait staff were quick to fulfill our needs despite the restaurant being crowded. Personally enjoyed the rich taste of the Black Pepper Crab as recommended by the order taker. Tried the drunken prawns too which I can't get enough of! The wait staff also took the initiative to bring us some wet towels when she saw that our hands are dirty from eating the crab. Very satisfied with the meal and service
1
We dined in yesterday at palm beach. Waiters were in a hurry to take our order since they approached last order time without giving us sufficient time to read the menu or inquire abt the courses. We ended up with the black pepper crab since its one of their star dishes. I can tell you that we only tasted the pepper, no crab at all. Wasnt enjoyable, and paid a SGD 200 bill. Finally, the waiters forgot to give us the crab cracker and they only noticed that wn we were done. Half of the meat was uneaten and the waiter opened the crab for us after washing r hands to eats the remaining bits and pieces. I wouldnt recommend this restaurant not for the lack of service received or for the high price, but simply for the lack of taste
4
Business dinner and 16 of us were seated at 2 spacious tables inside the restaurant.Captains and crews were very prompt with our request even though restaurant was busy.Before the crabs were served, few crews were helping us put on the apron.Coco Lobo (Fresh prawn with vermicelli in rich stock) has a special and unique taste. Most recommended to try

I'm currently sitting in your restaurant receiving the worst service I've ever had and eating the most disappointing meal I've ever paid for. We've waited forever to be plated with what is quite frankly below average food, we've been asked for last orders but haven't received the food we did order. We've been brought food that we didn't order. The fried rice we've been given is burnt and disgusting and one of your wait staff is doing push ups off the counter while others pack up the tables around us. Your staff are rude and arrogant and this place is an embarrassment. I'm annoyed that I now have to pay for this slop and put up with the attitude of the 'waiters' running around with ear pieces in. AND.. the surly madam who brought the bill just tried to charge me for hand towels we didn't use. Well done Palm Beach
4
This was for a business dinner for 5 tables. The menu was prebooked but was varied and interesting with the highlight the chilli crabs. I would go again
5
Wonderful Black Pepper Crab - expensive but a fantastic experience overlooking the bay/river and whatching the 8 pm lazer light showBy sharing your experiences, you're helping travelers make better choices and plan their dream trips. Thank you!

The restaurant serves nice chilly and pepper crab which is one of the Singapore's favorite dish.
However, we sat inside but it was too noisy and we could not really talk to each other.
So, I would not recommend for business dinner.

We were attending a convention in SIngapore and this place was recommended to us. So our team went there one night for dinner especially to taste the chilli crab. It was a really busy night and we had a bit of trouble getting our table sorted but after a short wait we were comfortably seated. We asked our very friendly waitress to recommend us some starters as we knew we wanted the chilli crab as a main. She suggested their seafood starter platter which was super. The baby squid were a little too sweet for my taste, but the razor clams with lime and chilli dressing was simply superb - I couldn't get enough of it. Then came the humungous crab with the famous chilli sauce - which was, for my taste, a total disappointment. It was too sweet. But that's me and my disdain for sweet in what I'd like to be a savoury dish. That said, the crab was divine of course. You can't much argue with good crab
3
This was recommended by concierge at st Regis, after we raved about jumbo seafood. It was good - but the bill was a shock. Significantly more expensive than jumbo. I don't say this lightly, but seriously think they may have charged us a tourist price. 100 dollars a person - without drinks - is simply silly. Food is good, but crab quality at jumbo better. The view is nice. But go for a walk there and then get to a jumbo seafood or one of the other "top" crab spots.
3
Their chilli crabs don't taste authentic and the crab meat was salty and not fresh. Service captain was nice enough to give us a discount when we gave feedback. They did have a couple of winners - the soon hock and bamboo clams were good. Probably wouldn't visit again though
5
Wow, ask for a table by the water outside. Excellent views and you get to see the laser show at 8pm and 9pm. Great menu. To simply ordering go for a set menu. Fast service even when a full restaurant. Would highly recommend if you like Chinese style seafood based dishes.

I was a dinner with my family due to we are really seafood lovers. Besides, most of my Singapore friends recommend me come to Palm Beach. So I decided bring my family for a dinner here. We made the reservation at 6pm to 8pm, due to there have a lesser show at 8pm. In deep actually I wish to have 6.30pm to 8.30pm seat. But there are fully booked. Fine, I am also feel lucky that I got a seat. In the evening, we reached the restaurant and got a great and warm welcome from their staff. After we got our seat. Which is near to merlion and got a direct view to MBS. The weather is windy without affected by sunset.We had not idea about our dinner and don't know what is good here. The staff looks like can read our mind, he came to us and recommend their signature food to us. What we had.. Bamboo clam steamed with garlic and seafood combination as our appraiserOf course, the main course we go for crabs. The chilli and black pepper crabs are really super deeper delicious. They even provided crab open service without request. That's why I really think that the staff there can read our mind. Time up 8pm, as promise we gonna to leave by 8pm but the laser show just start. How?Feel good, they understand what we want and offer us go after the show ( due to the 2nd round guests havent arrive, i knew this from the staff, without complain.. btw i like this kind of flessible service) What a great restaurant. I will be back for the sea foods and service !!

I held a birthday surprise for a gf from korea. In order not to disappoint her so i make all the preparation by pre-booking a table through email and emphasis to get the panoramic view of the Marina Bay Sands.Through email i get to know they have 2 seat timing either you get to eat from 6pm-8.00pm or you can start the 2nd timing which is from 8.00pm to the 10pm.I decided to book the 8.00pm as i do not like to be rush.Due to first seating unable return on time and they apologies for my 10-20mins waiting anyway I am pretty fine and not a fussy person as the hostess already start helping me to take order of my foods and drinks. It a nice gesture that they gave my gf a free dessert as her birthday gift. Due to the waiting time i experience they are nice to give us a fruit platter as complimentary which i m truly satisfy of how they handle the problems. I am satisfy with their service as they really hear us and they do tried to gives the reservation guests what they requested. It worth waiting a little more to get the table 42 which gave us splendid and breathtaking view. If i am a nasty and demanding person and they wanting to give me a seat well i would have missed this good seating. During waiting for the seat, my gf ask the direction of rest room and the hostess did extra mile by making us feel we are important as she personally bring her to it. Overall i am quite satisfy of their service and food they serve. Last and not least ordering of food they did also remind us that crab will take more than 30 mins of waiting because they only cook when there order and cooking awesome crab need times to prepare and i get to know in Chinese cuisine rice will always be serve last so if you want your crab and rice serve same timing please kindly inform them about it. I will definitely return and recommend friends to dine here

Was roaming around Raffles and stumbled upon palm beach. After reading the review on trip advisor, we decided to give it a try. Although we came as walk-in customers, we were seated after 15-20 mins of waiting and our orders were being taken while we waited for an empty table so the waiting time for the food was rather short. The hong kong steamed fish that we ordered was splendid and the helpful service staff even offered to cut the fish for us. Service was quick and not much prompting was needed as to when the next dish would arrive. Chilli crab here is definitely pricier but better than the ones you find in hawker centres or other well known restaurants. View was also breathtaking and also managed to catch the laser show too

Overall the experience there is good. But the standard of the food drop. Well but u can enjoy ur food with a good over view of the bay.
5
Well situated at the riverside by the Fullerton Bay Hotel. Amazing dinner, great choice and very attentive staff! Seeing all your needs and they are all very friendly. A bit on the expensive side but worth it.
5
We have a romantic dinner in front of the view in Mariana Bay next to Fullerton Heritage. It is famous for the chilli and black pepper crab. The fish is also one of its famous dishes. New style of singapore seafood.

My mother and aunts visited Singapore from Korea and we wanted to treat them a nice chili crab with a good view. With trusted TripAdvisor reviews and friend’s recommendation –we decided to dine in at Palm Beach on 2nd November. Expecting the crowd will be crazy for dinner like any other places–we made the reservation a week ago and requested for outdoor seats for 7 people at 8pm. We got our confirmation thru message – and we were excited. However, instead we encountered problems almost every turn.On the day of reservation, we reached the Palm Beach slightly early – around 15 minutes before 8. (The restaurant was crowded- and noisy.) So we approached to the counter to let them know we have arrived. (There were also few walk-ins waiting 30-40min for the table) The issue started when our reservation for seven at the outdoor table was not ready because of overfilled capacity and we were asked to wait under unguaranteed time promise. Out of curiosity- or rather already became sour; we asked if we have to wait until the table is available, what is the difference making reservation and coming as walk-in, and do they have a time limit for the diners. Unable to give us a straightforward answer, he said one of the tables is almost finished and we will be seated as soon it is cleared.Not long, we were given a table at our reserved time, however the process was not smooth.The next problem occurred when the waiter were taking our order. His tone was unfriendly and attitude was tired off, trying to cover up by saying “My English is broken.” When the vegetable were served first, we asked another server, Stella, who happens to be a manager, whether the fried rice we ordered will be served soon. Not only she bluntly replied that normally they serve rice after the vegetable, she rolled her eyes to us and said to wait for another 7 minutes. Overall, the food was okay. It was tasty and delicious but with what I experienced last night– I am not really sure whether Palm Beach Seafood worth the price.There were few more problems we encountered:1. We ordered 2 bottles of still water – half way through the dinner, the cups were half emptied- and we didn’t bothered to other another still water since enough. Then the Indian or Sri-Lankan server just poured the Tap-water over all our glasses without asking, letting our still water mixed with the tap-water. We were stunned and told him we had still-water for our drinks- and he didn’t bothered.2. We ordered 4 glasses of tiger beer. After awhile, we add another glass. We waited for 20 minutes but it wasn’t served until we asked for it. 3. We asked for new cleansing water to wash our hands- the server changed half and the other half served the old dirty water back. When we approached to the counter to settle the payment, we passed to reservation manager how upset we were and to trust all the good reviews made from TripAdivsor, and suggested retraining for the staff. By then Stella walked to us and started the conversation and apologized her behavior- but things happened already and our mood wasn’t getting any better.They gave us 15% discount from the total bill to make up the service they messed up. All I wanted was to get a proper service from what I was charged to pay.Okay, to sum up, overall my experiences at Palm Beach Seafood, Singapore:1. There is no difference in making reservation or come as walk –in. You still need to wait for table although you made the reservation.2. Although the majority of the guests are foreigners – not much staff speaks a proper English with manner – they are commercial, rude and unfriendly.3. Service standard was very low. Server doesn’t realize whether the order had been served or completed. Had to remind again.4. Served dirty cleansing water when requested a new one.5. Served tap-water over the glass with still-water filled.I won’t go back to this place ever again

I had delicious dinner in front of the riverside. this place is good for the chili and black pepper crab. You can also try the fishes with Singapore spices flavours, I tried chili crab and fish platter, no wonder it was a tastiest and flavored experience. Staff is is very good.
5
One of the better Seafood Restaurants around. Serves a very good Chilli Crab. Great service too. You may choose to seat on the outdoor part where you have a Great view of the Marina Bay Sands. Have been there each time when we are in Singapore. Made a BIG mistake on last trip early this month to try the No Signboard for a change. Will play safe and come back to Palm Beach for next trip.
5
I visited the Palm Beach during a business trip and was treated to the best crab I have ever had! I was with colleagues who claimed to be seafood aficionados (indeed they are). I must say the prices are more expensive however sitting by the waterside and buzzy atmosphere made it worthwhile. Three words. Black Pepper Crab. So good and flavoursome it was exceptional. My colleagues are from Singapore and they were blown away too. What are you waiting for, book now
4
First dinner in Singapore. Location is great!Right on the Bay, next to Merlion, Santosa. Good for big group family gatherings and have indoor air conditioning area which is the most important thing for us as weather in Singapore too humid and hot. Service is good and have quick response. Must order the Black pepper crab, one of the best seafood signature dish in Singapore. You will be amazed by the size of the crab. They made it not too spicy here. Recommended to book a table in advance, always crowded with both locals and tourists.
5
What could I say about, this restaurant it has to be one of my favourites, for its location right on the bay near the iconic Singapore Merlin and directly opposite the Marina Bay Sands towers. We were seated outdoors table, to enjoy the pleasant evening and watch the light show across the bay. The menu was superb especially the crabs are really fresh, strongly recommend to order Chilli crab and Black Pepper crab.Chilli crab is Singapore national dish just a little bit spicy and more to sweet taste, the black pepper crab is above spicy. Waiters were attentive and super friendly provided us with the best service. This made us really enjoy everything here, I will definitely be back

Our first evening in Singapore, wanted to eat local seafood and hadn't had a chance to fully research options or book in advance. We chose Palm Beach as it was close to our hotel, was on Marina Bay itself, and had reasonable reviews (and availability!). Service was friendly and fast to seat us and bring drinks. Our waiter took our order and was very helpful, suggesting when we were over-ordering. We then waited a long time. It didn't really matter as we were enjoying the atmosphere (buzzy) and the view (stunning). After 40 minutes our side-dish of morning glory arrived. It was delicious, but we finished it before our crab arrived. We asked what had happened to our appetiser of crispy squid, and at that point it arrived. The chilli crab was a disappointment, but in fairness we had not eaten it before so maybe it was meant to taste as it did. It was large and juicy, but I felt the cooking had killed the subtle taste of the crab. The sauce could have come from a large vat, not much taste. The crispy squid was rock hard - apparently this is the way they cook it - crunchy but to our taste slightly burnt. Also in fairness to them, they did not charge us for it. The crab was expensive - but you do expect to pay for the position of the restaurant right on the bay. So - rather a mixture. The restaurant was very busy (just prior to F1 weekend) and I felt they were just churning the dishes out

I visited Palm beach seafood restrant with my family. I think that booking is easy to get using Chope app.
4
Nice view, good location and service. Staffs are friend. We enjoy the night with splendid view of marina bay sands
4
food and atmosphere are excellent!
i've visited evening and have seat very very outside. night view is very fantastic! with marinabay laser show :)
5
The Resturant is located just next to the Singapore Merlion. The food is great and ideal place to spend time and have great food. It's best to reserve a table well in advance.
5
My Singaporean friends recommended this place so we all got together and had lunch here. The staff was very attentive and readily available for anything we needed.We ordered one chili crab and a black pepper crab, both of 1.4kg for SGD 218.40 and I would say that their original and one and only Chili Crab, was a winner. Make sure you order enough ManTou to dip in the chili crab sauce as it is beyond delicious.Just be warned that the restaurant provides a pre-packed wet towelette without mentioning that they will charge you SGD 0.80 per unit
5
Walked past it, saw the crowded tables, made a booking for later that evening and what a surprise! Pepper crab as good as Jumbo's, fried fish was served crispy and with a perfect blend of Singaporean spices - simply awesome!. Full tables meant the kitchen was stretched and our crab was running late (no complaint on our part as we were enjoying the excellent ambience and views!), the manager came over to apologise twice and when the bill was presented, he did not charge us for the dessert. Waiters were attentive and super friendly. What a surprise and definitely one of the best seafood restaurants I have experienced in Singapore
5
I had the best dinner in Singapore.The crabs are really fresh, strongly recommend to order Chilli crab and Black Pepper crab.Chilli crab is just a little bit spicy and more to sweet taste, good to balance your taste bud, if you did order the black pepper crab. The black pepper crab is above spicy, although I m a Spicy taker, but I like it really really much . Happy with the ' dessert magic' before they serve me the fruit plater. the staff would clean up your desk, no matter how dirty we made.They would upside down the table cloth and make it clean. Thanks captain max for provided us the best service. This made us really enjoy everything here.I will be back
4
We chose this of all the Chilli/pepper crab places in Singapore as we had friends visiting from overseas so wanted somewhere pretty where they could go sightseeing afterwards so this was a good choice for sure in that respect but if you are a true Chilli/pepper crab fan then honestly would suggest you go elsewhere for a much cheaper version that is likely also tastier. Service too was average at best
4
Loved this restaurant and its location right on the bay near the iconic Singapore Merlion and directly opposite the Marina Bay Sands complex. We had a tables outdoors to enjoy the balmy evening and watch the light show across the bay. The menu was superb and a little confusing at first until explained by the waiter. It is best to order an array of dishes and share. We thoroughly enjoyed every course which was sumptuous. They provide vests for you to protect your clothing while you tuck into the Chilli Crabs. The crockery is changed out regularly and towel fresheners provided often. You can even ask for little plastic gloves to attack your prawns etc. with gusto!! Our only criticism would be the price of the wine .... the cheapest bottle was $S90 which we thought was over the top so hence we only had the one bottle. However, Singapore is overpriced in general.
3
Had a get together with friends....to be honest i prefer simple seafood restaurants of singapore to palm beach....its biggest attraction is the location...i would not rate the food too high....it was a nice evening with friends....liked their fish and pork ribs but, will not say it was exceptionally good considering the number of good restaurants singapore has
4
I chose this place because of my mother first time come to Singapore.
Good food and good location but I don't think the service is great...
4
Excellent view of the Marina bay and very good chili crab, and in general all the dishes are very good, I love the fried rice.
5
very good restaurant perfect view.
cloose to the lions of singapure we enjoy one of the best dinner.
crabs crabs crabs awesome,tasty,really delicious.
If you visit singapure you must eat in this place.God job.
1
we want to have a good view and good tasty crab. But there are very loud and busy, so they don't remember my order. So I requested my order 7 times. Very expensive and very commercial. our family would never go there again. They only know money. Their crab was hollowed..fried rice was vey hard. Very bad experience.
3
We waited for 20 minutes, despite having had a reservation. They told us they were asking the other guests before to leave, but those gleefully enjoyed another glass of champagne before being bothered. That experience was quite bad. The food was good, the location is fantastic and it's quite pricey
4
This Restaurant is well located wth terrific people watching and marvelous view o the Marina area. If you like excellent seafood this is the place. Garlic steamed prawns, Baked Chili Crabs and the best Big Scallops on the shell that we have ever had. Be sure to make reservations for a good outside table
1
My relative from Kore visited me in Singapore and they were Crazy about seafood so I recommended them Palm Beach who is in the top 10 best restaurants in Singapore.  When we reached palm beach we were greeted by a staff member named Michael. He lead us to a table and gave us the menus, we looked through the menu and wanted to try the bamboo clams and the prawns which I have heard much about . We signalled Michael to take our order and after ordering the bamboo clams and prawns we were met by a shocking fact . it was necessary for us to order at least two crabs to be able to dine in palm beach  "That's ridiculous" I said why did we have to order crabs can't we have other seafood like the above mentioned bamboo clams and prawns. Is the two crabs requirement the Boss's idea or the sales team management . Overall a bad experience
4
The restaurant is located on the bay in a very nice position next to a handy bar for a pre dinner drink! Tables outside are best. The menu is limited but that is a good thing as you only really need to order the pepper crab and a nice bottle of white wine! Enjoy
4
Husband and me came here and sat table nice view of Marina Bay San, service by Max good, and we good time here. He sell us wu liang ye beer, rare see for restauron Singapore. We eat chili crap and fry rice and beef skewer, good
5
I come from Malaysia bring friend here, hear from friend that this restaurant is famous for crab. Ordered 2kg crab, they do half black pepper half stewed noodle crab. Crab was juicy and serf hot. We very enjoyed it. Also order the cocolobo prawn soup which is taste nice.Will come back again
5
AMAZING Singapore chilli crab. Every table had ordered one! The black pepper crab is also on par. Definitely a must in Singapore.

There was more alcohol in my kids Pepsi's than in the pink $15 Singapore Slings ...
Tut tut Palm Beach...
Food ok , expensive , service nice but rushed.
Great location.
There's better...
5
Great food and hospitable staff. A must-visit place if you want to experience a good dining experience
5
Very accommodating and friendly and the captain siam Hui is nice , hospitable and attentive to our order and needs . Will recommend the restaurant to our friends and colleagues .
4
If you want a convenient place to introduce your friend to Singapore famous Chilli Crab, this place would be a choice as it is right in the financial district and beside the Marina Bay. We had a few business dinners here.

Not having visited Singapore before, I asked the concierge of my hotel to recommend and book a popular local restaurant. I was booked for dinner at Palm Beach, near the historic Fullerton Hotel.Things started on a high-note. The manager at the door knew who I was before I spoke, and was extremely friendly. He escorted me to my table with genuine professional flair and a good sense of humour.Things started to go wrong after I was seated. A waitress came to take my wine order, but the 'wines by the glass' selection was extremely limited and horrifically overpriced. I decided instead to order a bottle. In a world-first experience for me, she refused to let me order a bottle. Presumably, she thought I was some kind of drunken hooligan, but my attempts to explain that it was simply because I'd prefer a Pinot Noir to go with seafood than the by-the-glass Shiraz fell on deaf ears. I ended up feeling somewhat embarrassed, and settled on the Shiraz. This is a HUGE black mark. The wine arrived, and was duly horrific, as expected.At this point, I became aware of an incredibly loud commotion behind me. There was a large family (Chinese, I think) with about 5 children who were absolutely wild. They were running around the entire restaurant, literally screaming as loudly as they could. Singing, fighting, shrieking, jumping and climbing all made an appearance over the next few minutes. Despite seemingly the entire restaurant looking at them, the owners of these little cherubs did absolutely nothing to calm them down. Crucially, neither did the restaurant staff.I ordered the Chilli Crab and a Mie Goreng, but by this point I was in a rather bad mood. After yet more shrieking and squawking I decided enough was enough. I signalled to the manager and told him I was leaving, but I offered to pay for the wine. He told me that the wine was (quite rightly) complimentary, and offered a table outside instead. I declined - the experience had been utterly compromised. As it happens, the family of feral children left just around the same time, but by this point I'd had enough. I at least hope the other diners managed to salvage some of their evening too.We all know that, sometimes, small children behave badly, and some parents are ill-equipped to deal with it. It is any decent restaurant's responsibility to other diners to step in and deal with the problem before it gets to this point.I have no idea about the food here. It looked decent enough, but I dare say I'll never get to find out.The 2 stars are simply for the warm welcome. Not recommended

This is my default seafood place but recently I checked 2 others out - only to reconfirm this is remaining the TOP of my picks. Service is excellent. I always have the black pepper crab - which is always awesome - and sometimes the Chilli - also very good. I also always have the fruit platter - because it is made up of local fruits - which my visitors always enjoy and many fruits they would be trying for the very first time. Reservations ar necessary to avoid disappointment

We were advised to try Palm Beach as we couldnt get into Jumbo whch everyone told us about.The concierge at our hotel recommended it.Well from the minute we arrived the Manager Michael was so pleasant and apologetic as our table wasn't quite ready. We weren't too fussed and not in a hurry, but hew came back to me a number of times and apologized. I told him all good, and he then proceeded to offer us a free glass of bubbles! too good.I asked for a table outside , but he told me it would be 1 1/2 hours, so I decided not to worry.He then eventually gave us our table, but surprised us with one outside.He said because I was so nice, he tried hard to get us the outdoor table, with a great view! he also threw in dessert as we told him we were here to celebrate our 20 year wedding anniversary.he then gave us menu choices and we went with all his recommendations, including the chilly crab and prawn vermicelli noodles.It was a great night, finished with a Singapore sling!not cheap, but well worth it for a great night.Michael , and his staff, Connie and Stella were fantastic all night

This restaurant is only "famous" among tourist. I went in April for a business dinner with several foreigners. The restaurant was and we waited 1 hr for our table, even though reservation was made in advance. The food was so-so only, and extremely expensive for lousy quality seafood. Nothing here is fantastic. I guess the only attraction to this place among tourist is the restaurant location. Not recommended for all who are visiting Singapore. If you would like to try true Singapore version chili crab, check out Jumbo Seafood, No Signboard, Long Beach, Seafood Paradise. Hope this helps

Palm Beach's superb service stood out from the many seafood restaurants in Singapore. Asst Manager Mr. Michael Ho went out of his way to find a table for us and the service staff was courteous, attentive and friendly. Food was of great quality, as expected. Would definitely return in future

We had the black pepper crab which was delicious and huge, however we also ate at momma kongs the night before- where we had an amazing experience and delicious food for half the price.
Good location, great food but cost us £250 for 4 people.
5
good view with delicious meals. award for the famous dishes. black pepper crab is recommended a good place for celebration

Dined at Palm Beach last Wednesday.Great location.Wonderful view. Chilli crab a little disappointing. Service was very good. Price a bit high.
5
Palm beach was good.
Especially, I like the atmosphere in Palm Beach.
But I wanted to be served by Korean.
5
Been to Palm beach yesterday and we have been served with top quality customer service as well as very good food. Crab is very good at resonnable price👍
4
All the food we ate was chosen by local people, I must say that everything was very tasty, especially the crab and the fruit composition at the end.
The outside terrace has a great view on the Marina Bay Sands we really enjoyed.

Located at one fullerton which is very exciting place in Singapore. And nice food.
However, the price is not cheap!

Not sure where to start with this review as I had been looking forward to trying the quintessential Singaporean chilli crab! And was very disappointed with this restaurant. First off I had booked a table outside which we got. As soon as we sat I noticed that the table cloth was dirty from the previous customers,not what you expect from an establishment charging this amount of money! Then the pressure started.....order! The waiter was back every couple of minutes trying to suggest food for us. In the end I suggested he go away and give us time to actually look at the menu ourselves and decide. We then ordered some prawns,chilli crab and some fresh rolls to soak up the sauce. The meal was promptly put in front of us and then we had to ask to order drinks and then ask for water and some forks to help get the crab out of the shell. No serviettes were supplied but we did have a paper bib placed around our neck! I guess therefore the White table cloth did come in handy! The food was ok not very spicy, I'm sure there are better and cheaper places for chilli crab in Singapore with better service as well! Our bill came to approx $300 AUD which included a bottle wine.The shock came when we noticed we had been charged 80 cents each for a wet wipe that had been left on the table at the end of the meal!! Really?? Don't waste your money here and find somewhere else to eat. I wish we had!!!!!

My wife and I are in Singapore for a 24 hour stopover en route to Australia and staying at the Fullerton Hotel, near the famous Merlion. The hotel booked us into the Palm Beach Seafood restaurant where we had eaten in a previous visit. It is adjacent to the Merlion and overlooks the waterfront which faces the extraordinary Marina Bay resort hotel complex. We were first given an indoor table as all outdoor tables were already occupied or reserved. However, Michael, the Maitre D at the entry worked miracles to find an outdoor table for us, even though this gave him the additional problem of accommodating other guests who had reserved an outdoor table. Thank you Michael for your great customer service!!We had a wonderful meal of Chili Crab and Spare ribs, and the service was attentive and excellent.
5
This is the second time that we have been here over the past few months and we really love it. They have now converted the waterfront area into a lounge area which adds to the ambiance while the restaurant area is modern and the food is stunning... We would highly recommend that others give this place a try..
5
The food is very good and atmosphere is excellent (outdoor).
Only slightly squeeze for big group of 26 oversea guests.
The guests had an excellent time and wonderful dinner.
*Very expensive though.
4
There are many seafood restaurants in Singapore but I still prefer the old classic Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant with a wide variety of seafood dishes that taste deliciously good.
5
This restaurant was chosen as a surprise for me and it didn't disappoint.
The waiters were friendly and the food good.
They recommended some dishes to go with the crab and it was perfect. I couldn't get enough of the almond coated prawns.
5
I am really satisfied with chope reservation to assisted my reservation at palm beach seafood restaurant
5
Excellent service advising us what to order with our chilli crab and then very attentively bringing us fresh finger bills and towels. Crab was delicious. Fabulous view across to the marina bay hotel's light show. Lively area. A must do in Singapore.
5
In terms of value for money, this is one of the best restaurants in Singapore.
There's nothing special about the presentation of the food, but the taste is exquisite.
2
The food did not taste the same as the last time I went 2 weeks back. Their signature dish Kai Lan was very hard. Chilli crab taste horrible, the sauce has a funny sweet taste that doesn't taste like Chilli Crab at all. The drunken prawns were not well cooked, and a little raw.Only the mee goreng was good.Pretty disappointed, and a let down for my guest
4
This place is in an unbelievable environment: close to the Merlion (symbol of Singapore) and in front of Marina Bay Sands and the Waterfront promenade. Seafood is excellent (Golden Crab is a must) and well served. Price is medium-high but reasonable for the place. Excellent outdoor dining to enjoy the spectacular view especially at night. Staff was attentive but a bit pushy to make you to conclude dinner quickly to have the table ready for other Customers waiting
5
Awesome cosy dining experience with my family at this restaurant surrounded by a beautiful scenic view of Singapore! Upon arrival at the restaurant, we had a well-received warm welcome by the Management and Service team, exemplary services~ they even help us with getting the flesh out from the crab claw-no mess, no fuss! Dishes were very delicious and super tasty.. Best of all, Gigantic Chilli Crab and completing our meal with juicy sweet tropical fruits!
5
Our arrival at this gorgeous city was greeted by my decade long, local foodie guru good friend and his wife. Taking us to dinner at this water-front seafood restaurant ' Palm Beach ' next to ' MerLion ', the combination of spectacular view, wonderful, sumptuous seafood and great company created an utterly unforgettable first day!Under the expert guidance of my friend, the mainly seafood based, local themed dishes he ordered were all wonderful, exotic and delicious.Our favorite was the sweet, sticky glazed, super-crispy fried baby squid. Resembling the Shanghainese fried crispy eel, the squids were so good, my wife was still raving about them after we arrived back in Hong Kong! Very addictive!Next came the iconic Chili Crab! The giant Sri Lankan crab, with claws the size of our large Canadian East Coast Lobster, was covered by a huge pool of sweet, slightly tangy and spicy, tomato based sauce. If there is a reference candidate for ' finger-licking-good ' food, this dish must be way up there!My favorite of the night was the umami filled poached live sea prawns in a mild Chinese herbal, wine and ' Don Guai ' broth. The sweet, crunchy and pristine fresh crustaceans were super-delightful.After the sumptuous and tasty meal, we all decided to take a long walk around the promenade, not only to enjoy the view but also, to work off all those calories!

Went for the Singapore Chilli Crab and wasn't disappointed. Also a great location and great view out across the Marina. A little bit expensive but well worth it for the experience and the food we ordered and ate.
1
The location and view was great however food was disappointing.
Ordered the crab seafood dry vermicelli however it was soggy and the vermicelli was in lumps.
It was so expensive $150 per plate definitely I have taste better elsewhere.
Will never go back again.
3
Chili crab at this place is okay. But the price is high. I had 1.6kg crab ($120). I am really satisfied with the services as well as the view of the restaurant.
4
The food is great with nice presentation, excellent service and nice ambience. My family had an enjoyable time at the restaurant.
4
This restaurant offers crab as one of their seafood specialty. Great taste, and if you prefer, you can choose outdoor seating for an experience of dining with great views to Marina.
4
We decided to try this restaurant during our stay at the Marina Sands. Pleasantly surprised with the quality of food and service. There were 8 of us. To make things easy we opted for the set menu. All the courses were served hot, fresh and flavorful. The chili crabs were excellent! A bit messy to eat but worth it. They provide a bib to protect from crab sauce drippings. Glad we decided to try this place out. They offer inside and outside dining. The place is clean, tables well spaced and the indoor dining area is well ventilated. It's a nice leisurely walk to the hotel
4
First evening in Singapore and we wanted to try some crab. Our server was very helpful and recommended the black pepper crab that is a signature dish of the restaurant. We were very impressed with the spicy taste and enjoyed the hands on eating that is very messy but very satisfying. Thankfully they provide lots of wet wipes and a bib. Expect a price of at least $100 per person.
2
We were there for a friend birthday celebration last Friday. Amongst the 6 dishes ordered, the salted egg crabs and cereal prawns were a great disappointment. Both dishes are too salty to our liking. As we did not indicate any preference for seats online , we were automatically given a outdoor seat despite the hot weather. The only consolation was table allocated was under a ceiling fa
4
Was recommended by the concierge, not many selection of food, and some are in big quantities, had to order a big bowl of soup which was for 8 people and we were 3 only, but it was the only soup available.Appetizers are cold not hot dishes, but it is a good seafood in general.Wish they had more selections for all ethnicity.
2
Disappointed with the quality of1) appetiser (achar pickle) : soggy, requested for new ones with marginal improvement2) chilli crab : have tasted much better at much lower $$$, even in Sydney3) steamed fish (pomfret) NOT fresh & overcooked, definitely too Salty!! NOT edible can't even drink the soup base! A definitely No No in fine dining restaurant4) reasonable friendly table service ruined by below standard food from kitchenThis is only a personal experience shared by eight of us recently. Reviewed by someone with over 60 years of tasting food here & overseas. Could be THE wrong night
4
Great location, great chilli crab, especially for first timers! Michael was super friendly and welcoming + the light show across the water was an added bonus! (Coconut icecream was great too 👍)
1
Came in around 9pm and got last table inside. Service awful, pretty much ignored. Food was also far from impressive. Not sure why it is ranked so highly.
4
Food was great especially the black pepper crab. Special thanks to the reservation manager Michael Ho who was very hospitable throughout our dinner. One of our best experiences at a seafood restaurant and would definitely recommend it to friends!
4
This is not a cheap restaurants, but great for special occasions.We find the seafood superb, the cream crab and cereal prawns are unforgettable. It's location is great, short walk from Merlion and other tourist attractions. This is very popular restaurant, they operate a 2 hour table turnaround time
4
We sat outside overlooking the bay. The food here is excellent, fast service.If you like to eat Crab then you are in the right place. However expect to pay over $100 per person not including alcohol. Alcohol in Singapore is very expensive. I suggest sticking to mineral water or perhaps A beer if yiu want to keep the cost of dinner below $300 for 2 people.Overall we were very happy with this place . The food didn't dissapointment neither did the service. This is one of those places you need to visit if you come to Singapore
5
I was researching for good crab restaurants for my birthday dinner and I chance upon Palm Beach which has many excellent reviews on its different style of crabs. I ordered the salted egg and chilli crab (both at 1.8KG and the price is 1KG for $88) and i must say is the freshest crab i ever ate. The service is top! The service staff actually bought me a M lazy Cake and a bowl of fresh fruits (View pic), complimentary !. Overall, im very pleased with the restaurant with food and service. As for the price, the total price came up to $400 plus for 2 crabs, 1 veg and 1 chicken (There was no alcohol). I want to shoutout to the service manager, Michael Ho for the awesome service i received at the restaurant for my birthday. So Thank you
2
Came with high expectations because of tripadvisor, but this is very obviously a mass market tourist trap. firstly our crab costed us over $200 (we suspect they deliberately overcharged us).The Singapore Chilli Crab was doused in ketchup and was sickeningly sweet without a hint of spice at all.The other dishes were alright, but could easily be found at some hawker stall.To make things worst, the entire place was like a canteen, ignore the table clothes and china inspired decorations and you would basically find yourself in a tuckshop. Service was non existent and a little rude.The only consolation was the half decent view of the bay
5
Just a Special Singapore Seafood restaurant next to Merlion, very special food with chili crab and pepper crab. You can find there the price reasonable with very fresh seafood. Next you can eat and view Marina Bay Sand.Good place for invite your business friends or your lovely member.Remember booking the table before you come.The staffs very good in service.I always choose there for dinner with my business friends.
2
When I arrived at the restaurant at 8pm, the waitress told me that Sri Lankan crabs are all sold out. The alternative are only UK crab or Alaska king crab. She recommended UK crab which turns out to be not fresh. Other dishes we ordered are only so-so. Would not recommend this restaurant and unlikely to go there again.
5
We have a visiting friends from Macau in February and it was slightly after Chinese New Year and what better way to spend our evening, to dine out at Palm Beach @ Fullerton, of course! Thank goodness for an advance reservation as the restaurant was full house with all kinds of patrons from all races. We were greeted and ushered to our indoor seatings by none other than the person responsible in taking my booking, Michael Ho. He is very gracious and such a joy to have in recommending us the best dishes that Palm Beach could offer. Sadly, my favourite crab dish was not available, the baked Cheese Crab that we settled for Black Pepper & Salted Egg crabs and they were amazing!! We had several other dishes like the mini squid, salted fish fried rice, you tiao, Yam Ring with mini abalone and the Bamboo Clam vermicelli, best recommended dish ever! Despite all that, we ordered another fresh steamed Sri Lankan crab! The service rendered by Michael and Rahul Arora were superb and that makes the dining much more pleasurable. Not forgetting the chefs too for the amazing dishes and thanks to the service staffs who also put the closure beautifully with a nice dates dessert and tropical fruits. Thumbs up for a great dining experience, our memories were totally embedded with such great hospitality and delicious dishes! On that note, I am counting the days to return for my baked cheese crabs!
5
Went with Singaporean colleagues who ordered for us. We had around 20 different dishes, both fish and meat. Highlight is the crab (garlic, black pepper, and chilli were the three choices we tried)
5
Needless to add more words, it is the best restaurant to enjoy great food with greater view. Also, would like to thank Mr. Michael Ho, the reservation manager, for the kindness and hospitality!
5
Nice location,very good food.
especialiy chilli crab and bamboo clam!
after all super gentle and staff are perfect hospitality!
4
It was really good location, and view. even though it was heavy rain!! The food was good and staff is friendly
5
Best pepper crab ever eaten . Great portions. Fantastic staff. I would highly recommend to anyone in Singapore to eat at this restaurant.
3
Many people around there. So loud, complicated..Expensive compared with taste. But view is excellent.
5
I dined here on business with a party of about 8. I have had both chili and pepper crab many times in the past at the seafood centers across Singapore (Long Beach, etc.) ... enjoying the experience but finding the crab itself just so-so. But here are Palm Beach both were superb ... the pepper crab was the most outstanding. We also enjoyed the steamed fish (some of the best I've had recently) and the crispy baby squid (great as an appetizer with a really cold Tiger beer). Palm Beach is expensive, but I found it worth it. In fact, when I came back in November for a family vacation, we had chili crab (pepper would have been a bit too spicy for my young son) for our Thanksgiving dinner.Service is hit or miss depending on what time you are there, how crowded the place is, and who you get for a server
5
I went to Palm Beach with a number of friends for a meal and boy, what a meal! Terrific seafood cooked Singaporean style. The chili crab was very good, the steamed fish terrific, the razor clams wonderful. A really great meal which I hope to repeat one day
3
Positives - great location, very tasty food. The let down was mixed staff, one younger waiter in particular (andy?) was really patient and attentive but then another came and had zero manners or courtesy - weird. Also be careful of just choosing the special, very good and also twice the price of menu dishes when you get the bill - shame and rather spoilt it. Singapore brilliant !!
5
Food was really great but we had to wait almost half an hour for our table even though I made reservation. We had to wait another 20 minutes after the initial dishes for the crab dishes to arrive. That was the down side but when the dishes arrived my guests were totally blown away.
5
We had a feast in the run up to the Lunar New Year including the Singaporean New Year dish including the ceremony to combine the ingredients, Great fun. Excellent crab too and so many other delicious things.
3
Overpriced and standard of food and service was only average. Given the hype I expected better. Yes you could see the night show but only if you were lucky enough to have an outside table.
3
Palm Beach is one of main of the better chain seafood restaurants in Singapore. Whilst I have eaten at most of them over the course of the years, it was the first time surprisingly for this particular restaurant.Recommend the drunken prawns, deepfried Yu Tiao, the Chilli Crab of course and also Hong Kong style steamed fish. My favourite for Singapore remains Hua Yu Wee (not a chain and in Siglap) however, Palm certainly beats Jumbo (my least favourite and complete tourist trap) and Long Beach.So much good to choose from
5
We tried chilli crab and coffee crab. The tastes of Chilli and coffee fills in the crab meat, not just stays on the crab shell. The fish with rice noodles is a new dish recommended by the waiter, also tasted great! We sat at outdoor and the view was beautiful :
5
I will go through the list of things in the title: Perfect Location: It indeed is the best location to view the bay. What's more is that one can look out to the Marina Bay Sands resort complex and see the water and light show, which is not to be missed (and you are given a different experience of the show from this side of the bay).Excellent Service: We requested to sit outdoors by the water and they seated us in one of the best tables there. The manager, Michael, went out of his way to make sure that we were satisfied and were having a good meal. He and the other wait staff explained the meal to us (the Singapore crab selections), since we were very much new to the experience. I have never had such good service in a restaurant before.Excellent Meal: We had the prawns and the crab (both varieties: black pepper and chili). They were delicious and we were told that they were prepared by one of the best chefs who specialize in the crab. Michael also brought over some extra chili crab sauce and then complementary fruit for desert. Overall you cannot go wrong with this restaurant and I would say that it is a must for staying in Singapore because you experience a great signature meal of Singapore, have service that goes above and beyond what is expected and a view that encompasses the sights and sounds of the bay
4
I always search out some where new to try Chilli Crab when I am in Singapore. This was recommended to me and it was the best Chilli Crab I have had in Singapore. The chilli in the background and not so dominate as in other places. The location was great, opposite Marina Bay Sands at One Fullerton. Fair value and a good service. Plenty of other choices if you did not want Chilli Crab. They claim it was invented there; who knows it may be true. Either way it has been around since 1956 so it must be doing something right! Enjo
5
When in Singapore, Crab is a must-do and Palm Beach Seafood is an amazing place to do just that! We enjoyed a relaxed evening down by the waterfront at the home of the Chilli Crab and it did not disappoint. The service staff took amazing care of us, sharing a few ideas and wine tastings with us before choosing just the right bottle (a Pinot Blanc from France). We then hunkered down and got busy demolishing our large crustacean friend. It was messy, it was fun, it was delicious.Trekking through the food halls of Singapore is an amazing and frenetic experience. If you feel like a night off from that pace and need to relax with amazing food, wine and service then you'll do very well for yourself at Palm Beach. We sat down about 8:30pm and didn't leave for a healthy 2-3 hours
5
What a lovely night! We walked past on our second night in Singapore and thought that Palm Beach looked lovely and it absolutely was. Great service the whole night, our waiter showed us three different wines he thought might suit us, he talked us through the amazing menu and we loved every moment of it!!! The chilli crab was fabulous and the light show a nice event to have happen over the water. Totally recommend this lovely place and hope everyone has as nice a time as we had
5
First time with a crab in its full shell and it was made so easy and we were really able to enjoy the taste of the well known Chilli crab that we have been recommended to have. It was delicious and we were fortunate to have such great service. Stella was generous to help us with dissecting the crab so we could enjoy the taste and it was all kept warm too. Needless to say, the views are fab and it is a must do
5
The place is stratigically located for tourist like us . Our dinner came after the light show of Marina Bay Sands that make it more magical. But the real star of the night was the Chili crab that was prepared to perfection and made me to over indulge on the mantao and the addicting sauce with the pickled pepper. The succulent spare ribs was also superb. The soon hock was so crispy it made me pick the very last fiber of the marine delicacy. The rice was very liked by my Son who only eats yang how fried rice. The staff went over and above to their attentiveness towards our every whims. Two thumbs u
5
We came here from a friends recommendation and it certainly was up to expectations. We are crab novices so it was great fun working through a very sizable crab (it was the smallest!).
Solid night and a memorable experience.
4
food is excellent: pepper crab, black sauce prawn, etc
environment: outdoor is much better during night time. indoor is a bit too noisy.
service: generally nice.
5
All the invited guests, local and non local enjoyed the food and the view very much! Especially the first timers in Singapore
5
The concierge asked for a table outside when he made the reservation. Do that and you can enjoy a nice evening and watch the night laser show and that will spare you a boat/ferry ride to do so. It is very busy but service is overall good. Go to the back of the restaurant to see the live aquariums and food they serve. We got the recommended chili crab for 4 persons and it was excellent
4
Palm Beach Seafood was a fantastic spot to first experience the delights of Singaporean black pepper crab. While it's located on a pretty touristy strip, the view is undeniably stunning, providing a glamorous panorama of Marina Bay. The ambience is lively and friendly, though the real gem is probably the service. The staff is incredibly attentive to gluten allergies, but it's wise to phone ahead. They were definitely sensitive to my needs as a celiac, and I was able to try some classic local food styles, which is a rarity. I would definitely recommend returning - if you're gluten sensitive, ask for Joanne or Michael and you'll be in for an evening peppered with good humor. PS if you ask to meet your crab in advance they will totally let you. Be prepared to stare right into its eyes as it approaches its death with zero dignity. It will be delicious
5
There were 3 couples who dined here to watch the light show over Singapore Bay. We didn't try the famous Singapore crab but everything we shared was delicious. Lamb chops and ribs were delicious plus the string bean side dish was delicious. Outstanding is the fruit plate dessert with exotic Asian fruits. Overall a wonderful evenin
5
Great views , great food and wonderful staff. Try the crab dishes it's very messy even though they gave me a bib but maybe I just know how to eat crab. Also delicious veggie dishes. See if you can book outside but inside is good too especially if it rains. Quite reasonably priced
4
The concierge at the Mandarin Oriental recommended Jumbo's and Palm Beach for Singapore's famed chili crab. We opted to walk to Palm Beach for lunch. Here's what we wish someone had told us before we went:PRO1. The portion is huge. Two people could easily share one of the "small" 1.6 kg crabs. The larger size would have been 1.8 kg.2. They did not overcharge for the lime juice ($4 SGD), but they did charge 80c for the wet towel. Not a big deal.3. This is a most unusual dish, not found anywhere else. 4. The waiter gave us a thorough explanation of the origin of the chili crab and instructed us how to eat it.5. It is very delicious. and there is a lot of it.6. It was perfectly cooked.7. Everything that came out of the kitchen looked large and very well prepared.8. Convenient to our hotel.CON1. The price on the menu is "market price". This is misleading because a lot of the other entrees are in the $30-50 SGD range.2. We asked, "How much?" the crab was. The waiter did not answer us. We had to ask a second time. The price is $120 SGD. Just be aware of this. 3. You will have to work at cracking open the claws and shell, even though they have already loosened it up for you.4. You will be given a bib - and you will need it.5. Bring some tissues, because your nose will be running.NEUTRAL1. The service was OK.2. We were still eating the first dish when they brought the crab. Not great timing.3. The wait staff seemed aloof. Until you engaged them in conversation - then they were really nice. I think they just work very hard and have to concentrate on getting big platters of food out while it's hot.4. Fine dining prices at a casual restaurant
3
Sitting outside as a largish group, we had a splendid view across Marina Bay, including the light shows (which are nice, but not as spectacular as I had expected; see photo).Service was competent, mostly, and a great assortment of seafood dishes was delivered in our banquet, finishing with Chilli Crab (pictures) and assorted fruits (picture) spectacularly served. We began with a fun process of making our own seafood salad together (see picture). Certainly sufficient food, and the variety would have meant everyone had some enjoyable dishes. Beer was cold, too! It's really hard to service a large group (about 40+ of us) at about the same time, and the restaurant and staff did it well for the most part. Food was generally served very well, in the sense that it looked terrific (lots of photos were snapped!), although the taste was not exceptionally good. Certainly acceptable taste, but I've had better.I am pleased I was not paying the bill, however ... as I think it was quite expensive, unsurprising perhaps in view of the location (about 40 m from the famous Merlion). I suspect that if money was a concern, there may be better choices in the area, although Singapore prices are often very high (especially for alcohol, because of the taxes, which are not the restaurant's doing). Overall, a pleasant experience, which I enjoyed, partly because of the good company, as well as the location and the table displays of food
5
It is a very nice restaurant in a fantastic location. The decoration in this seafood reataurant is quite Chinese, and so is the cooking style. So don't expect Western style cuisine. My favorite dishes are herbal soup with shrimp (see picture) and frog leg with garlic. Quite a surprise to be able to discover dishes like those, which could hardly be found in other asian countries, such as Hong Kong or mainland China
4
The location and food is good. But service could be better. We enjoyed the crab and eve the lamb - surprising for a seafood restaurant to serve great tasting lamb chops!
4
Very good, tasty and meaty crab. Better than Jumbo. Location is perfect. Morning glory with ladyfingers was not that great. Satay, Fried rice very good. Overall good meal.
5
Besides the renowned chilli crab, golden almond prawn is a must-try. The food quality, ambiance, and location are worth the splurge.
This restaurant serves multi purposes, be it a romantic dinner, family/friends gathering, or a spot to enjoy new year's fireworks.
4
Amazing paper crab worth the effort to open. Also fried rice and deep fried groper was very delicious. Would recommend setting outside for the view but might b humid.
5
I came Singapore to enjoy some famous dishes and to watch new year's fireworks with friends. I was impressed with the view, the food quality and the wine collection. I had a memorable time with friends on 2016 new year's eve, would definitely recommend this restaurant for people who would like to enjoy a more luxury side of Singapor

We had a family member and friend passing through from AU and wanted to treat them to Chili and Pepper Crab.Time constraint was a major factor or we wouldn't have chosen this establishment.Ironically, the friend is a Cooking Show finalist/celebrity which we were unaware of as we sat down. We were just happy we could get a late reservation and were able to be seated outside. The seating and placing of our order was very prompt and smooth and then, everything changed!Our order started arriving with vegetables first within 5-8 minutes and then 4-5 minutes later the Chili Crab but our appetisers or buns or seafood rice were nowhere to be seen. When we asked, we received the standard answer, "I'll check"!We started eating and the buns arrived in a few minutes and so did the Pepper Crab. We shuffled to make room and still no appetisers or seafood rice.Everyone was in good cheer but the topic of "blur" service and unprofessional kitchen execution was mentioned along with, "that's S'pore".For a restaurant of this caliber in this location it seems to reaffirm one more time, s--- service in S'pore!Ok, to finish the saga, the rice arrived halfway through the crabs and the baby fried calamari appetiser came in last and I forgot to mention that my Wife's Chinese tea never arrived! I think they were "still checking"!!!!!!Considering we only drank 2 bottles of sparkling water and it cost S$85-95 per person. I'll pass on this restaurant the next time I consider Chili crab or seafood

It was my second time to Palm Beach Restaurant. The foods and environment are good, I purposely brought my parents who came from Malaysia went there for lunch.All the staffs are nice. I will recommend this restaurant to my friends and sure will come back again

Great ambience with fantastic view. Food was delicious, especially, the black pepper crabs, fish soup, and herbal drunken prawns!Excellent service by Stella ( Sasa ) from China --- although she was busy, she went the extra mile to ensure our party had a great dinning experience. She made great food recommendations and was attentive to our needs. Thanks Sasa for the wonderful dinning experience

Our reservation was for outside at 800pm, too busy when we arrived, and eventually seated inside at 815. Rattan chairs are incredible hard and too low for the table, so they had to move other chairs around the room for us.Menus appeared but no one came to take orders for 10 minutes.Get the manager. Comes across very apologetically and sends across waitress wearing a face mask.Get the manager again,he advises that they are short of staff and the girl is sick! Get rid of her immediately and get me a proper waiter , he does and the rest is history.We see 2 staff working with face masks.This is supposed to be a very expensive 5 star restaurant, great views and ultra expensive crab and sea food.I would get the health authorities here. Dreadful place, hard seats ,very poor value for money as well..Crab is very large and very nice but I wouldnt take anyone here or recommend this to anyone

Well ahead of the meal, Michael, the Assistant Restaurant Manager tendered his full thoughtfulness to ensure our special requests`re perfectly entertained.On 12.12, Michael offered us a bottle of “Sancerre Blanc”to pair fabulously with those awarded Sri Lankan Crabs in Chilli, double baked and black pepper.Amusingly, he followed us the “Petit Chablis” which wonderfully matched with a Chef's special, “Stewed Vermicilli with Crab”.Because of the brilliant crabs, we missed one of the highlights, “Tinkala Barb” which Michael assured it's uniquely deliciousness from meat to scales.  We`ll certainly reserve one in the coming visit.It's such a gorgeous evening with superb seating, freebies as well as the attentiveness from other global staff namely, Andrew (Korean), Ishara (Sri Lankan) and Sasa.  Thanks the whole team, well done!!!Palm Beach@Fullerton Road's definitely my finest dining place in Singapore whensoever with guests all over the world, and a spectacular view of Marina Bay on the patio reassuringly

Better than No signboard, I'm serious.
The view is nicer too, nearer to the river.
Merlion is just beside.
5
the view is amazing, and black pepper crab is finger licking good! fruit plates must try! service is great!

Many thanks Michael for the accommodation. Dellicious Cream and Chili Crab and Fish variations. We will remember this evening forever.

We took my mother in law here for her birthday and it was a huge hit. We sat outside and watched the Marina Bay Sands light show. The ambience was great. The food was fabulous. We had chicken satay, prawns, the famous lemongrass skewers of beef and pomegranate chicken, all of which went down well. The fruit platters for dessert are a great way to finish a delicious meal
4
We were here with the family, to celebrate one of our family member's birthday. After making a reservation, the restaurant was so full, we came a little late, due to the heavy traffic.The food is good, the crab is super, prawn is also very nice.But the location, by the water, next to the merlion, is really something.It was not easy finding the taxi to go home.Overall, very nice...
5
Staff is friendly and efficient. Food was served quickly.. The chilli crab was served with cold sauce though, heating pan underneath cannot keep the dish warm as the sauce was cold in the first place.. Pepper crab was excellent. Wine was good but a bit pricey.. Overall a good experience..

My traveling companions and I had been recommended Palm Beach Seafood, and we found it to be excellent - albeit a bit on the expensive side. I had planned to try the allegedly world-renown chili crab but at SIN $120+ each, i decided more reasonably priced (SIN $31) "drunken shrimp" would have to do. They did. They were boiled whole in a fragrant admixture of herbs and whatever and were excellent. Those with me tried variants of noodles and seafood and enjoyed their meals greatly.I don't know if I find this "good or bad," but the restaurant personnel were almost rude when I asked if we could find an opening at the first sitting (5 p.m.). They agreed, but only if we were out by 7 p.m. when the waterfront table we were given was reserved. Two hours was plenty of time, and the service was awesome and friendly. (The waiter, a graduate of UNLV's School of Hospitality, recommended various dishes for us to try. He knew what he was talking about..... If you go, expect excellent seafood at a premium price, but for heaven's sake, have a reservation
4
We asked our hotel (MBS) for a recommendation on a good chilli crab restaurant. Mabel at the concierge desk recommended Palm Beach Seafood. She said it was a very old traditional restaurant with a good reputation. The food and service was good. Next time I think we will try Jumbo Seafood
5
We dined here just before nightfall and everything was perfect -- from the crystal view of Marina Bay in front of us and the delicious crabs!The place is a little bit pricey given its location but if you have some bucks to spend, indulge it here. Tip: Get a reservation
5
Great location, friendly staff, good food and good value!! Even put a bib on me to eat my chili crab, will go again when I'm back in Singapore.
5
Food here is great. I really enjoyed all the seafoods menu we've ordered.
Location is superb, great view of all the main attractions in Singapore.
4
A nice water front restaurant that offers excellent seafood and particularly the famous pepper crab. If you go there, I would recommend the Sri Lankan pepper or chilli crab
4
Food was very nice, 2 of my friends from SG separately took me there so this must be a local recommendation. Tried the chilli crab with steam bun and would totally go back for it. Coconut juice on the other hand seemed to have sugar added in it and tasted artificially sweet. View was very good as we got a table right by the bay

My oversea friends and i visited palm beach yesterday , we order the sashimi lobster to enjoy the freshest catch at palm beach but when it arrived the lobster look like a handicap lobster without a fillers on one side of it and a missing leg too ...we approach the service staff and request the see chef at once . After a few minute the chef came near our table and immediately he went back to the kitchen and after a while the missing leg was served . what a joke how sure is the chef know that the lobster`s leg belong to my table ? From the dustbin or basin sink and again we informed the manager .She sent her apology at once and we didn`t blame her for that ,the kitchen should look into the matters at all time . We understand the nature of breeding a fresh lobster if you can`t get the other fillers intact cut the other side as well . What a pity cause it is a basic standard that palm beach seafood restaurant should have

My business associates drop by Singapore this week and we decided to dine at palm beach seafood restaurant as they serve the best dish in town with a fantastic view in the heart of the city . My PA booked a table for ten persons and when we arrived a little late but the service crew was very attentive and patience . I was really proud of crews as they greet us with a warm smile as the restaurant was packed with food lover at that time . So we decided to order the best set dinner at $1388.00 as I proudly recommend to my business associates we deserve the best .... Every dishes was o.k. until the service crew informed me that there is No chye sim with mineral water and they replaced with another type of vegetable instead . Than come to the Fried Durian it was also not available and what the hell is happening Out of the few dishes TWO dish is not available than I suggest that if palm beach is not ready to start the $1388 menu than DON`T PUT THE $ 1388 Menu on the table .........as we feel cheated and we believe there is other customers felt the same too . The location was Great , Service was Good and jus because of the two dish has changed the whole image of Palm Beach`s Reputations 
4
Came here for dinner without reservations and was able to get a table about 30 minutes before the daily laser show from Marina Bay Sands. Our table was outside too! Chili crab was delicious. I would say come here for that, other dishes were ok. Great service
3
Had the chili crab (delicious!) with some bread (very sweet) and some pork ribs (average) and after sharing this with my partner we were both very full. Service was average at the best. We were pointed to our table by a rude young lady. Yes, literally she only pointed to which one. The order was taken by a different person - briefly no recommendations or smiles or more words than Yes and OK. After finishing our first drinks before the meals even arrived - no one asked we needed a refill. When they delivered the main my partner asked for another beer - which never arrived. Beautiful restaurant though, saw a bit of the MBS laser show and enjoyed the chili crab. Not so much the $250 bill at the end of the average dinner experience.
5
Second time here and a vast improvement from our last visit 2 years ago in both the interior restaurant and food.It was fun with a family of six back then when chili and creamy crab were enjoyed. This time it was only 3 of us, but the venue (again outside with a great view of Marina Bay) and food were fantastic and the staff were great when we engaged in a little light bantering about the mess created - they seem to like seeing people enjoying and appreciating the food and there is no way to avoid a mess when eating crabs in the shell. You will need a lot of hand towels! We ordered Black Pepper Crab, Golden Milk Prawns, very tender Beef Skewers on lemon grass stalks and the best noodle dish I have ever had 'Palm Beach Noodles' Go and enjoy the perfect venue and tasty food with a pint of Tiger
5
This is our second visit to this restaurant, now amongst our favourites in Singapore. The reservation went without a hitch, and the venue is one of our favourites with inside, but particularly outside dining on a raised platform with great views including the laser light display when dark. Our reception was first class with extremely pleasant, efficient and friendly staff throughout the evening. My pepper crab was if anything better than my previous chilli crab, and the prawn and beef skewer dishes were similarly great. Altogether then this was a first class dining experience, and one we would strongly recommend (probably outside), and one we will always visit when in Singapore. First class - well done all staff
5
The service provided by the staff at palm beach was second to none. Attentive, very helpful with menu recommendations, polite and made our dining experience unforgettable.
1
No table available at booking time, had to reminder wait staff multiple times for everything. Had to pay for cleaning towels. No crab available of quality. Food was average. Only redeeming feature is location but much better places.
5
In a beautiful part of Singapore, we had an outside table and look after by an attentive staff. The food was really good, some unusual dishes, all delicious, superb Chiil Crab and you get a bib to protect you clothes. Good value.
3
I had a business dinner here, chosen by the p.a. of my guest as one which offered 'typical' Singaporean cuisine. The menu is somewhat confusing which a large number - around 30% of items - not having a price as they're 'at market' and the main course section only being one page long. Service was slow - we had to wave furiously to get attention and almost comedic in value; we asked about a certain dish (which had no description at al next to its name) and were given a long and hugely descriptive response - when we eagerly said we'd have it we were told "sorry, it's off the menu tonight"...With one bottle of wine the bill came to around SGD370, not exactly a budget night out. There are better options nearby - try Jing further down One Fullerton for great food and better service if you want

We decided to have dinner at Palm beach few days ago . The location was indeed the best in Singapore with a beautiful view of merlion , marina bay sand . we booked the table outside the restaurant but later change our mind due to the haze lately . The restaurant was full at that time when we arrived , after a short while our table is ready for us . when we placed our order from the menu ( the most famous chilli sri lanka crabs ) was out of stocks . The manager recommend us another type of crabs to replaced the usual sri lanka crabs , and at that time it sound really disappointed , well I explained to my associates that just keep our finger crossed and try the new dish . The table next to us was making hell of noise as they also can`t get sri lanka crabs aswell too . after about 30 mins the chilli crabs arrive on our table and I taste it with a pcs of bun , to my surprise the sauce taste the same and the crabs meat is jus smaller than the usual sri lanka crabs that all , what is the big issues on the next table which I don`t understand at all . . we order a fish , prawns , a vegetable and a fried rice . ma ma mia all the dishes was indeed fabulous . and the service crews was indeed well trained which make us feel to come back for more ......... Thank You , Palm Beach and all the staffs to make it a wonderful dinner I ever had 
4
It was a nice reunion with my partner's friends and former colleagues. The food was good and all fresh ofcourse. Very nice ambience and location. Staff are nice but a bit uncomfortable. It would be better if they always wear smiles on their faces and be more confident on what they do (They are good but its an objective and constructive comment for them to improve). Above all, it was a nice night with a nice dinner
1
Ate here with colleagues. Table reservation was late ie it wasn't ready when we arrived. Food was nice but not standout. Staff were poor at keeping drinks topped up. Worst of all they charge 80 cents for additional wipes!! This is a crab restaurant people! We need to clean hands! We asked for 1 extra wipe, guy brought 8. We didn't think anything of it until we got the bill and realised they were charged. Waiter never even mentioned it. Terrible.
1
Made booking for 12. Arrived 5 mins early. Table available 30 mins late. No Sri Lankan crab available. Preferred fish not available. Took 30 mins to get wine. Asked multiple times for water. Eventually he food arrive. Had ordered rice, did not come so had to order second time. At time of order asked for fish to be served separately. That's dos not happen either but by this time could not be bothered asking for anything else given the incredibly poor service. Recommend never go to this restaurant.
4
This restaurant serves very good seafood. It is also quite creative and well plated. Service is quick and friendly. It is heavily burdened by tour groups, but they manage this quite well. Unfortunately, there appears to be collaboration amongst the restaurants in this district to keep the price of Chili Crab at a ridiculous level. Foolishly, I paid $128 for one chili crab. Every other restaurant in this area charged the same. These elevated prices appear to be a common theme wherever there is a Financial district nearby.
3
My business associates arrived a week ago and I recommend palm beach seafood as it was well known for its seafood , without hesitations we decided to dine at palm beach . We arrived at the restaurant it was almost full house and to my surprise we were informed that table is ready in the short while . The service crews was indeed well trained and greets us with a wonderful smile when they show us our table . We placed our order after a while ....Cold Dish Combination arrived in 20 mins , The presentation was very, very bad , Softshell Crabs was over cooked , Scallops was very hard and the rest we don`t even want to try at all . QC went on leave ? or palm beach don`t even employ one ? What a pity the first dish has changed our image for Palm Beach Seafood .. We informed the manager about it , she sent her apologies patiently and offer to change a new cold dish commination which really can`t change the image after all 
3
Good view, but too expensive
Not good value for money
It is good to bring family to experience
Still recommend if price is not an issue
4
Nice Chilly Crab with the best views! this restaurante get very busy and it is not that cheap but the views are nice and it is famous for the Chilly Crab.
portions are very big so be ready to share.
4
The seafood here was great but oddly enough, the dish that stood out most for me was the duck, it was AMAZING!
4
Palm Beach is in a wonderful setting on the water near the Merlion. The place is known for its Chile Crab - which is well worth the visit. Other featured dishes were also very enjoyable. The only negative was that the restaruant is so busy, service is sloppy. It took a while to find someone to take our order. Then, one of the dishes was forgotten. The service shortcomings made the evening much less enjoyable than it otherwise would have been
4
One of the best seafood restaurants I have been to in Singapore. They specialise in Chiili and Pepper crab dishes. We had chilli crab which was fresh and tasty, as were the other dishes we ate. We were at a table outside. The service was good and we had a great view of the evening light show from Marina Bay Sands
5
This was my first trip to Singapore and my host took me here for chili crab and pepper crab. It was delicious and they have already done most of the shell cracking work for you.FYI, when you are seated the table has a finger bowl. This is a shallow glass of water... but it has a plum or something inside that gives it a golden color. This is a fingerbowl to wash your hands during eating... don't try to eat it!!They also give you a packaged wet towel.Also, this place has Chinese style seating indoors with the large round tables
4
We had dinner here to celebrate a birthday. The Palm Beach Seafood Restaurant began 59 years ago as a small seaside restaurant in 1956 at Upper East Coast Road, and I can still remember our family going there, sitting very close by the sea enjoying some of the nine dishes they then had on their menu. After several moves, they are now located at 1 Fullerton Road #01-09 One Fullerton, Singapore 049213. Their current location can boast of marvellous views of the Marina Bay area, the nightly laser shows coming out from MBS, and views of the Singapore Merlion, which are among the reasons that many tourist dine there. The restaurant is also in close proximity to the River Boat Cruise jetty. For appetisers we had the Combination dish comprising bits of creamy Alaskan lobster, very crispy deep fried spring roll, bamboo clams in green chilli paste and crispy fried soft shelled crabs. Almost immediately, we were served a bowl each of their King prawn with vermicelli in superior broth. This was followed by a garoupa done in two ways: half deep fried till crispy and half part steamed; then a broccoli with mushroom and salt fish; a mock duck served with thin wafers of egg skin wraps and cucumber slices. Next came the Black pepper crabs, a platter of fried noodles and lastly, the fresh cut local fruits. The food was tasty, flavoursome and aromatic. The Black Pepper crabs evoked hot peppery sensations on the palate with a strong aroma of butter. The taste of sliced crunchy Almonds almost dominated the mok duck dish, the broccoli dish was a tad saltish for my taste, and the noodles were sweet and yet peppery. Portions were very good, and the dishes came fairly quickly. Our plates were changed three times during the course of the dinner. The waiters and waitress seem to be scurrying around, seemingly very busy, serving, clearing tables etc. The restaurant has an outdoor area where views of the Marina can be had while dining, or an indoor area which is comfortably air-conditioned, but also having a higher noise level. An excellent place to celebrate an occasion, a business function or simply for a dinner out with family or friends. There’s a comprehensive drink list, and the view outside is a certainly a drawing point. There’s no WiFi available. It’s wheel chair friendly, with toilets inside the restaurant. The restaurant opens from 12.00pm to 2.30 pm and 5.30 pm to 10.30pm Mondays to Sundays. They have a web site where you can view their range of dishes and drink list. You can also book online or call or fax them for reservations.The place seems to be constantly filled with tourists, so reservations are strongly advised

Had a late lunch here as we wanted to try the local specialty of chili and pepper crab. Drunken shrimp was really good and the seafood fried rice was delicious, and at $12 for a small portion (more than enough for 2) was a great bargain. The crab, while it was good, was about $130 (yes for one crab). The staff didn't offer any pointers on the best way to crack/eat it, I was just glad they told us what market price would be when we ordered or we might have tried 2 kinds. Be prepared to get messy, it looked like I had finger painted with black paint by the time I was done
1
We booked on a friend's recommendation to go to this restaurant on our last night in Singapore. Unfortunately we were horrified when the first menu item was shark fin soup. We are fully aware of the horrors of shark fin severing and this immediately put us off. Then further in the menu live lobster is an option. And if you want fish you must choose it and then it will be killed for you and cooked up. With all of this we had no faith that any of their seafood products had any humane or sustainable treatment at all and politely left.I think from what I saw this restaurant is also likely to be very expensive - which we wouldn't have minded as a one off if not for the other issues which we could not put asid
3
Had lunch at this establishment on my last full day in Singapore. The location of the restaurant is wonderful and if you get a table near the front I imagine the views are good. Service was very spotty. We only saw our server when seated, ordering and delivering food. My peer and I had Peppered Crab, Drunken Prawns and Seafood Fragrant Fried Rice. The prawns and rice were excellent and if you go I highly recommend both. The crab, well let's just say it was an experience. Lots of work to get the meat out but when you did it had a good flavor. Noticed servers at other tables were assisting their tables in removing the meat, we were not offered the same assistance. I think if we had been assisted the experience would have been better as would the rating.
4
Gotta love this tasty creatures! Awesome experience great view and food. Honestly the service was a little slow, but food and view was so good that we did not bother, after all you are on vacations!
Recommended.
4
The location is good as we get to enjoy the scenery as we eat. The food is nice and the prices are reasonable. Overall the service is excellent and I enjoyed eating with my family here.
4
Great location overlooking the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, nothing can be better than dining with friends on a balmy night, a few drinks watching the great light show of MBS. Oh and the food is pretty good too. We tried the whole steamed fish (which was huge) Mud Crabs and BBQ ribs! They rolled us home
5
Great place to bring overseas guests if they're asking for local food and you'd like to provide them with a central location and air-conditioned environment.The view is also perfect as it overlooks the marina bay and if you come at night you will be able to see lasers from the marina bay sands. Ordered Chilli Crab, Satay, Hor fun, Prawns, Kai Lan. Coconut for drinks. Very pleased. Make reservations ahead of time (especially for dinner as the place will be packed
4
Been there a couple of times because of the crab. Black pepper and chili crab are superb. View is great (over the bay to Marina Bay Sands). Only grain of salt is the service, and the reason why I don't give more points: the service staff was always I have been there (six times) slow and arrogant. A pity
3
The sight and view we had was amazing. Directly across the Marina and the light show came just about time. Show was a great. The crabs that came were male (no roe .. probably due to season) and relatively small size since we had several other dishes to compensate. For the food it is definitely overpriced. We have been to many other places in the world with lots of much more impressive fresher food in Europe/ Asia and lesser in price. Nonetheless we were still happy with everything else. Do try other restaurants in the same strip. We went to Clark Quay/ bugis junction later for dessert 8-
4
I found this place purely by chance and boy did it deliver! I wanted crab and I got crab. The views are spectacular and the service is very efficient. The highlight was my crab dish. The sauce wasn't too overpowering and the crab was fleshy and delicious. I definitely recommend this establishment if you are looking for good crab
4
Be sure to book and be sure to turn up on time as this place is popular. Especially if you want a table inside with air on. And, so it should be. There is an excellent range of seafood available with genorous portions. So, pick a few and share. There are meat options available for the less adventurous. Service is fairly prompt. And, outside tables afford a good view of the Palm.I strongly recommend the pepper crab
5
A lot of people say Jumbos is the best for seafood in Singapore. I disagree palm beach does massive crabs and their Black Pepper sauce is to die for, you get loads and the crab meat really tastes of it. The other things are good but who cares you have to try the crab
3
we were having dinner on 3rd of aug 2015 at the best seafood restaurant in Singapore we order one chilli crabs , one black pepper crabs , prawns , fried rice and etc ......... the chilli crabs arrived about 20 - 25 mins , follow by the prawns and so on ,the black pepper crabs was no show after 30 mins and we order another chilli crabs and it was served after a while and again there was no sign of black pepper crabs again . we approach the service crew and was informed that it take a while more for the pepper crabs ..... after 10 mins we approach the restaurant manager or outlet manager this round and she was very patience to check for us , as a matter of facts the way she work look like a captain in a average restaurant instead of a well known for the best seafood restaurant . we understand that the manpower is the main issues for F&B industries but the management of palm beach should look into the matters and get a solutions to cater for customers needs asap , that means there is a handful of service crews in palm beach and I can't imagine the kitchen staffs is also short ? Finally the black pepper crabs arrived in 55 mins after the chilli crabs dish 
5
excellent Singapore style seafood cuisine with a fabulous view of Marina Bay Sands and Singapore skyline.
3
One of the first local seafood restaurants on the scene with claims to be the creator of the well-known chili crab, this branch on the Fullerton waterfront offers a lovely view of Marina Bay Sands. Its good location is the main reason why it is usually filled with guests and tourists but the seafood though fresh is only average now that there are many other better and less pricey options out there
3
I've been to Palm Beach a few times - mainly for work dinners. We last went in early July with some overseas friends. The plus is that the venue is cleaner than other restaurants and conveniently located near; a good venue for guests from out of town. However the service can be erratic and inconsistent which it was on our last visit. Also not the best place for chili crab. I'd prefer to go to other seafood restaurants for better food and value for money
5
The setting is along the river in Fullerton, facing the beautiful Marina Bay sands Hotel. The menu is the famous Singapore Chili Crab (1.4 kilos), golden prawns and yam dessert. We were seated alfresco with wonderful view. the food was fabulous, We even saw the fireworks from Marina Bay Sands. Although the weather was warm, but the chili took care of that. All in all a fantastic food with the best view. Highly recommended
5
Had an excellent meal at Palm Beach Restaurant. Apparently on of the best places in Singapore for chilli and pepper crab. The patio had a great view of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. A light show occurs at 8 pm for about 15 minutes only. You have to make reservations! You may want to sit indoors! Windy and may be hot on patio
3
The company has reserved three table with palm beach last week , the location was indeed the best location in town with amazing view of marina bay sand and the most ideas for business , social , family and etc .......... which deserved to be call the place Fit for the King location . The service crews are also Excellent with positive attitude toward all my guests that my company invited ( 30 Pax ) and the service is also Fit for the King as well . I notice such a busy restaurant they should look into the QC of the dishes that we order too. The chilli crabs taste difference from the last time we dine about 2 week ago ( 3 Pax ) The pork rib is downsize for the same price ? The black pepper crab is acceptable . The Worst is the final dish we order Seafood Fried Rice .... The Seafood Fried Rice doesn't look like fried rice at the first place ! The texture is so moist it look like porridge instead . just imagine Seafood Fried Porridge ! Frying porridge in a cooking pot instead of frying pan ? It taste awful and salty too . Every things seem o.k. until the Seafood Fried Porridge spoilt the image of Fit for the King Palm Beach Chef only cater for small group ? Can't handle big group ? What a day for me to remember !!

This is for lack of a better word, a 'tourist-trap'. They always seem to have run out of the smaller crabs and force you to order the larger ones, which are more expensive.The food taste is very average. You are better off going to the real local shops, or the East Coast Seafood Centre.Our bill was about $700. The waiter refused to serve dessert to us saying that they need the table for more guests.
1
I went there with a couple of friends for a special occasion, and we all left with a terrible experience. Needless to say that we are never going back; we've told a lot of our friends and colleagues about our horrible experience here. Not only the food was bad, the waiters tried to cheat you on the weight of your seafood and the prices. Based on other guests' reviews, looks like defrauding their guests is a usual business for them. I'm surprised that this restaurant is still in business.
4
We had booked this restaurant for a special occasion and had asked for a "Good table". We had to wait about ten minutes beyond our appointed time but were then given a table with a lovely view of the Merlion and Marina Bay sands. We opted for the set menu for four and thoroughly enjoyed each course - the fried rice and the black pepper crab were our favourites. Service was friendly and efficient. We would go back
3
I was late for my reservation at palm beach seafood last week and to my surprise i was greet politely by the service crew at the door infront of the restaurant , the waiting time wasn't bad with beautiful view than we are serve with a mint drink while we wait to be seated, the drink is really refreshing . We were busy taking photographs than in a short while we were informed that table is ready . we order the usual seafood platter , we realize the oyster has a aroma and is not fresh as before . fragrance bean curd is too starchy and the pork rib is 40 % smaller than I use to dine ...... Did palm beach employed a Quality Controller to make sure all dishes did meet up the standard of the restaurant reputation that has been so many years in restaurant industry ....OR the chef has left the company ? It was indeed a bad experience but after all the beautiful view with a cooling mint while we wait may be worthwhile 
4
It's not cheap, not fancy either, but the food lives up to the reputation. Pretty crowded and noisy both indoors and out. We were happy to be seated in an indoor corner. Outdoors would have been pleasant except too dark to see one's food clearly.
4
Liked: Excellent place, view and food!
Disliked: The place is always packed, be there early. Serving time is quite long, but worth it!

You have to sit outside if you eat here! The view is amazing and you get to see the entire marina bay sands! Come for dinner and have som crab! My favorite here is the pepper crab but the chili crab is definitely delicious as well! Service is so so, they seem really understaffed . But great experience and atmosphere!!

Reserved the table for 6. We got arrive on time, but somehow they cannot find our reservation until I showed copy of email confirmation. We were directed to very small table for 6. Our next table was exact same size and only 2 people sitting. The table was not comfortable enough for all of us to sit. Took a while for waiter to come. In fact, he start to wait on other table which came much later than us. Our sever's name was Jee Shanee. Food took a while also to come. Once food start to come, since the table was such a small one, didn't even have place to put the food on and waiter almost spill the water onto us. Chili crab came, but we had to ask waiter few times for apron, needed to wait for a while for it. Water was empty, had to asked to fill up. But when the waiter came, he only filled one glass and left. So we had to as again for. Asked to changed to clean plate. He replaced only for 2 of 6 people's. Needed to ask again. The food was nice, the location was nice. But we did not get adequate service for the price. Every small things which we had to ask, needed to tell few times to server to do, like water, clear the empty plate.... If do not mind to those it is very nice place to dine.

We went to the restaurant Palm Beach for a business dinner, on a week day. The place was busy, but since we had booked well in advance, were seated outside at the terrace. The views were amazing!We ordered several starters, crab as main (with hot and spicy sauce and with sweet sauce), and for dessert a mix of excellent fresh fruits.Food was excellent, and for such a large group, the different dishes offered a great mix of flavors.Service was ok, but we had to wait long between the dishes.As the place is normally very busy, bookings are highly recommended
5
Loved the black pepper sauce and honey tangy fish! Staff were able to recommend dishes, and also very clear about the weight of fish/seafood that would work for our group. Also as the fish is ordered by weight, they explain the weight and pricing at the time of ordering. I guess if you have a specific item on the menu or fish you prefer it may be worth calling in advance to make a reservation(if they allow it)

In Singapore you need to eat the crab, so a colleague took us to this place. The food was great, we had a sampler as starter: soft shell crap, spicy clam and mini squid and some sate, all delicious. As main we had black pepper crab and vegetables, very tasty.Fresh mango as desert.Not cheap, that is why only 4 star

Group of four of us came to this place for dinner. It's probably a good idea to book because we still had to wait even when we booked. We ordered the chilli crab with mantao, morning glory and amongst other things. We really came here for the chilli crab as suggested by our friends. It did not disappoint - it was really good but it was also quite pricey. We sat outside so we could see the Marina Bay Sands hotel and the lightshow that was on. Very cool. It's a very romantic setting.Service was very good though it could have been slightly better. We asked one of the wait staff to take a photo of us and she did not look impressed. Luckily another wait staff offered to take another photo for us

This restaurant combines great food and excellent service in a beautiful setting on the Quays. It is beautifully fitted out and even when full not excessively noisy.Naturally we tried the chili crab which was excellent, together with several other dishes including the crisp and crunchy baby squid which was great. Prawns in seafood broth were also great.There is a good wine list at average prices for Singapore.Altogether a wonderful place to eat

Went to Palm Beach with a group of overseas friends on a Friday night as it offers a great view of the Marina Bay and near to the hotel they are staying. The food is good and I liked the black pepper crab a lot, even better than Jumbo's. However the service was horrible, we ordered a bottle of champagne and jug of beer and it took more than 30m for them to serve us the drink! And it took even longer for our food to be served! We ordered some buns to go with the chilli crab, and the buns came out 30m before the crab was served. My overseas friends got so hungry waiting, they actually went to the bakery next door to get something to bite while waiting for the food... The additional order I made later was never arrived! While it took almost half hour to get our drinks and an hour to get the food, the waitress had no problem to hurry us up to leave when the next group of people arrived....I knew that we had the table for only 2 hours when I booked but I didn't expect that the food took an hour to be delivered....In the last few years, bad service has become a norm in Singapore due to the lack of manpower every F&B outlet is facing. I didn't have high expectation on the service standard from Palm Beach but it still managed to disappoint me with the horrible service it gave our group on this occasion! Will NOT recommend this place to anyone
2
After being told that we were late (5 minutes max), we waited our food for 50mn...!! And 20mn just to refill a jug of beer... And the black pepper crab was quite disappointing... So nice view but that's all.
3
Happen to go during construction, the food was okay. They have a great view but unfortunately the AC was hot and for such a high end expensive restaurant, it wasn't. Very pleasant experience.
4
Had the best Chilli Crab & Mantao bread I've ever tasted.
The ambience was quiet nice. The waitresses were attentive and helpful.
We had the lychee tofu pudding for desserts and it was very good.
5
Palm Beach serves one of the best seafood in Singapore, alongside big names like Jumbo and all. Generally, all huge seafood franchises in Singapore are good, therefore I would like to specially commend them on their service.I ordered an iCe cream cake for my friend's birthday. To our surprise, the cake took a way longer time to defrost and we were in a huge hurry. The waiters were super nice and they actually helped us relentlessly to cut the cake. They soaked their knives in hot water, they took turns to try and finally THEY DID IT! Their service made our day and this is what I truly want to recommend them for.On top of that, realising it's one of our birthdays, they offered a huge fruit platter, on the house. Wonderful service
5
Be prepared for sitting outside (dress in light clothing) with a spectacular view of the Merlion and the bay. Service was efficient and friendly. The food was very, very good. We had chilli crab, grouper, various appetizers, coconut prawn soup, rice and broccoli and bok choy. All dishes were delicious. Fresh, wonderfully seasoned and perfectly cooked. Great to be there when the light show goes on - perfect view. Great evening with friends and colleagues
2
The reputation exceeds the actual experience at this famous restaurant. The service was very slow, often waiting 10m or more to get water refilled even though we were paying a fortune for bottled water. Food also took forever to arrive and not well paced (does anyone really want the vegetables before the main course arrives?) The food itself was okay, though personally I prefer more meaty flavorful San Francisco crabs or even the small Maryland crabs which at least are easy to hammer open. They do not provide the tools you need and are stingy with napkins and wipes. Overall the experience was well below what you would expect at a higher end place. If you want better crab (minus the view) I'd hit one of the outdoor food centre/hawker stalls. And beware the spicy chili oil will do a number on sensitive stomachs. I'll be generous with 2

Hotel Concierge at Swissotel recommended this to us, as we wanted Chilli Mud Crab before heading home from Singapore. Great location, right on the waterfront, opposite Marina Sands, next to The Merlion. They offer indoor & outdoor seating. Menu is very good, service is great & prices are very reasonable compared to restaurants in The Raffles Market City area. Had a 1.6kg Chilli Crab for just $90.00, in a delicious Sweet Chilli Sauce, plus some special Fried Rice with shrimp.... Just a small serve did the trick. Beers were all $10 or less, so all in all, we were very happy and head home ticking off all the things we wanted to do in wonderful Singapor

4 of us went to the restaurant at the suggestion of the hotel concierge. It was a short walk from our hotel and was easy to find. We were presented with the menu needed the wait staff to help explain some of the items on the menu. We finally decided on the tasting menu for 4 because it offered an interesting variety of dishes. The waiter was very good at explaining what we would get. Each dish arrived very quickly......some before we finished the previous dish. Unfortunately, the runners delivered the dishes but their English was unitellgible so we weren't sure which item on the tasting menu we were eating. Applause, however, goes to the waiter. When we called him over he explained what we were eating. He also divided each dish into 4 servings. If not for him I am not sure how we would have managed the servings. The dishes were delicious. Two of the men in our group were still hungry after the meal. For the price the size of the portions leave much to be desired. We would not go back
5
Fabulous location- over looking Marina Bay and the nightly light show. Great food- Try the crab, also had prawns and it was superb. Very attentive service- We arrived late and they were happy to seat us, we obviously kept them later than usual but they were very accommodating. A must do!
5
We were very well attended in a very busy time, which says a lot. The views are superb at night time and the food was great. We didn't try the crab as the price was $68/Kilo and the minimum size was 1.6kg, but we ordered some usual Asian food. We regret we didn't listen to the waiter, who recommended to order only two small plates ($10 each plate) for 4 people, we ordered 2 mediums and 1 small and it definitely was too much for 4 people. So it is a very good place to eat for not much money and enjoy a great vie
5
After walking for hours in Singapore zoo, we ended up in Marina bay for lunch. The food at this restaurant was really good. The famous singapore sling was well priced and refreshing.
3
Another tourist trap place offering up the usual fare, Chilli crab, but not the best i've had and expensive due to the location on the waterfront. Service ok, but some of the dishes strange to say the least.
5
Delicious food directly at the highly frequented waterfront. Perfect for people watching I was surprised that the food was top, nevertheless. Also the service was good - they even sang Happy Birthday for me... Definitely a "must see" in Singapore!
5
We went to this restaurant as a group - 8 of us in total. The wait staff were extremely attentive, taking our orders promptly and delivering high quality food quickly. We had both the Chilli Crab and Pepper Crab (amongst other dishes) and they were spectacular! They even catered for the Vegetarian members of our team who commented on the variety available for them as well. I highly recommend this restaurant â€“ it has wonderful food & service but is also in a fantastic spot facing the waterfront, next to the Merlion.
1
It's really my bad day ever in my life as I actually booked and goes with my girlfriend during Valentine day as stated I wanna it to be outdoor seat but ends up telling us to seat indoor upon our arrival as they should told me earlier on that there's no outdoor seat available. Totally disappointed and ends up we leave the restaurant and we went to MBS to celebrate out Valentine Day dinner...Conclusion,their services is the worse i ever encounter...
5
This restaurant was strongly recommended by a client whom enjoyed the view, location as well as the food. We had double bake crab, chilli crab, teochiew steam fish, golden milk prawns, kai lan dual style and more. Well, end of the day, there was nothing left on the table and everyone enjoyed the feast. Price well, not cheap
4
Well - I was invited so do not ask for pricing but for sure not a bargain !Food was a fresh mixture of regional cuisine. Some new stuff for the European but made well and mostly warm.Location at the water is great. Enjoyed probably mostly the location and atmosphere
4
We visited this restaurant 16/01/2015. Wanted to try the reccommended chilli crab. Nothing really special, sauce was just standard nothing exlusive or unique, nothing to die for need to come back The view is amazing, especially in the evening. Marina Bay Sands hotel just in front
2
Great location but this clearly makes them complacent. There were plenty of staff when we visited but none of them seemed interested in us. They managed to forget our rice and there was no flexibility when it came to ordering our fish. Despite there only being two of us, they could only offer a portion big enough for 4 - and charged accordingly!! There are many better options than this
5
Being from Baltimore, MD, we were tempted to want to try Singapore's famous preparation of the Sri Lanka crabs. At the recommendation of the conceierge at our hotel, we went here. It's located right on the harborfront and offers outdoor seating. The location and veiws could not be better.We started with cocktails, baby squid and bamboo clams (razor clams to us). The freshness, preparation, and taste of these dishes was perfect.We next ordered their Chilli Crab, Morning Glory vegetable dish, and Bok Choy & Seaweed vegetable dish along with their recommended baked rolls for dipping. WOW! All were prepared perfectly and were served with a most appealing appearance. We loved every bite of each of these dishes and drank their local beer along with them. We used a combination of our hands, chopsticks, and other utensils to dig our the crab meat from their cavities. The taste of everything was scrumtous. Because we ate an early dinner, although we were satiated, we decided that we also had to taste the Black Pepper Crab. It's the same crab prepared in a copletely alternate style. It too was absolutley delicious. We ate it all and loved every bite of it.Worth noting is that, with this messy food, their attentive waitstaff in clearing shells and offering clean plates every few minutes helped make the meal that much better.The meal was expensive. The return was well worth it for us
4
We went there for black pepper and chili crab and were not disappointed. The food was great and we liked everything we ordered.
Good location to walk along the marina to the Merlion after lunch.
2
The view and location of this restaurant is great. One Fullerton is a lovely place to walk along. The selection of food was not great and the staff not very friendly or helpful.
4
Location is perfect. Exactly on the merina bay, MERLION the iconic statue . Great feel when we were there. Outside is best to seat. Food is perfect but we felt a bit expensive.
4
I recommended creamy crab, mix spicy with sweet and cream like use for pasta.
Location also good. Great view for merlion and marina. Walking around fullerton road in night so great.
You need to do reservation to ensure table availability. So full. Enjoy.
5
Great place to bring out-of-town guests. It's a little noisy, so definitely not a place to a romantic dinner. Service is decent and the food comes out fast.
3
went with a group of people arrived 8pm left at 10.30 only had small amount of food served.was to be a banquet that was pre ordered and paid for only received fish skin awful baby octopus a serve each of 1 prawn,salmon,crableg and oyster When the chilli crab arrived it was not goo
2
We decided to chance this Restaurant, as it was too wet to look around.Beautiful spot ,but the restaurant was let down by overpriced food, and terrible service.Will say that the satays weren't too bad, and were ordered as an entrée. The garlic prawns were also ordered as an entrée, and were ok. However, for some unknown reason the mains were brought to the table, before the entrées, causing confusion when queried. After some time, it was "sort of" sorted out, and the entrees brought to the table. Think the mains were warmed up before being brought out, tasting rather "second hand". Would never go back to this Restaurant, and really can't recommend it
4
if you are looking for restaurant with best view, nearby attraction and with AIRCON, this is where you should go.be prepared to pay a bit more as it is more expensive compared to other seafood restaurant as its only two of us, we had their chilli crab, with mantau bun (which i never ask but they still charge me), tofu dish, drunken prawn if you are looking for best place to eat chilli crab its not the right place but im not a fussy person in term of chilli crab, and i would rather eat in somewhere cooling, so this is the place i would go for its convenience.
5
If chilli crabs is your thing then you have come to the 'right' restaurant. Eat it together with steamed buns to soak up the sauce - yum! There are other flavors available to choose. Other seafood items such as bamboo clams, baby squid and shelfish are delicious as well. Accompanied with a glass of wine or mug of ice chilled beer, enjoy the light show across the bay with Merlion spouting water next door - dinner couldn't have been better with friends or loved ones
5
From chili crab, octopus, and squid, to abalone, prawns, and oyster, Palm Beach Seafood serves excellent seafood with oftentimes complex preparation. The outdoor seating is next to the water with a view to the Marina light show in the evening. Service was average and the price was high.Still, between the fine food and great atmosphere, Palm Beach is an appealing option
4
Had steamed seabass in soy sauce. Fish meat is perfectly cook and have juiciness. Soy sauce is not too salty, well done. Curry crab is good but we prefer the crab at Jumbo.
5
Very enjoyable lunch with colleagues. Black pepper and chili crabs both outstanding. Deep fried baby calamari very enjoyable, and I don't normally like calamari.
3
We had chili crab, Steamed fish and vegetable dish. Overall food quality was fine but service is slow. Initially asked for small fish since it's only two of us, but they only had 1kg. Asked for female crab to get the roll, but not available. We were there at 6:30 when restaurant opened. it's a seafood restaurant but whatever we asked were not available. After all I will only visit if I have foreign friends visiting singapore.... due to the location and view.
4
This is a place that serves a nice black pepper crab. I am not saying "the best in town" because I haven tasted the crabs in the over 200 locations in the cityâ€¦ But definitely one that is worth going. The best is always to wear black clothes (if you order chilli crab, wear RED) :-) One tends to get a bit messy when eating this dish. Maybe after you tried all the over 200 locations and you figured out, which one is "the best crab in town" you won't be that messy anymore. Anyway, Palm Beach is a nice place, you can sit outside on the Marina Bay Waterfront with a view of the Marina Bay Sands and the Merlion
5
I was in Singapore for business. My partner brought me there for seafood and he did it right. The food is really good, everything i tasted. Crab, giant crab and other chinese and thai foods were excellent. I don't know if it's expensive or not because my partner paid the bill . The position is perfect to watch the light-water show and it's closed to everything. Nice place, Worth to go there again
4
Visited this restaurant during Singapore F1 weekend, so it was very busy and had to make a booking ahead. Chilly crab was not the best I had in Singapore but still very delicious. Location of this restaurant is very convenient and within walking distance if you are staying within the Marina Bay area.The drinks list was not extensive but they were happy to allow for cocktails to be ordered and brought in from the bar next door.They have large outdoor area overlooking Marina Bay Sands and you it is right next to the Singapore Lion
4
Lovely location, we sat on the terrace and luckily the weather allowed that, with a cool breeze coming off the water.Fried baby squid as a starter was wonderful, followed by fresh crab in curry sauce. Crab flavour was wonderful and it was well cooked.Service started poorly but improved to an OK level, but overall, not great service.The portions were all a little on the large size for my liking, but that did not detract from the meal.The prices are on the high side, but I guess one has to pay for the overall quality of food and the lovely location.A great experience, one to tick off the list
4
Our dear friends suggested this restaurant, not only for the food, but the great views over the water and the skyline. Later in the evening there were fireworks too. The speciality here is mud crab, but we had other dishes like prawns, deep fried cod, pork which you put into a thin pancake and greens. We drank an Australian red wine. Our favourite dishes were the cod and the pork. It is very casual and we sat outside to enjoy the view. The service was appropriate, not too intrusive. We cannot comment on the cost as our friends treated us
4
I have been here on my last night in Singapore and we were 8-10 people. We had 3 crabs, shrimps plate and a noodle. Crabs and shrimps were very good and i liked them very much and the food were enough. The servise is fast and good, so go if you are around :
5
I had the good fortune to visit on two occasions. Excellent (expensive) black pepper crab during the evening whilst watching the laser light show across the bay. On another lunchtime I enjoyed a wonderful baked fish with superb accompaniments. No surprise that it is still going strong after 58 year
4
It was a beautiful night we sat outside with a view of the merlion and marina bay. We shared a pepper crab and steamed fish. Food was yummy!!
Service was average at best.
3
Prime real estate obviously means you can charge the earth. The food was fine, service average but price ridiculous.
4
This is one of my go-to places for out of town guest. Great location with a great view of MBS, and close to the Merlion. I'll book for dinner after 8, so guests can view the laser show at 8 before dinner. Order the fried mini squid, black pepper crab, and the cocolobo
4
One Fullerton, where Palm Beach is located, is a waterfront delight filled with good restaurants and cafes as well as a stunning view to boot. Be entertained by the laser show coming from the top of Marina Sands Bay as the gentle breeze adds to the amazing alfresco experience.Book a table (as Palm Beach fills up pretty fast...and I was there on a weeknight) outside to enjoy the view. Even on a warm it, they have ceiling fans to provide a cooling breeze. Let's start with the crabs...the main attraction of this place. We ordered the butter crab and this went brilliantly with steamed buns. They also have these buns fried...but personally, the buttery sauce was sufficiently sinful without the added guilt of deep frying the buns. The crabs were beautifully done. The fish (fried whole fish covered by a sticky tomatoe sauce) and veggie (stir fried kailan stems with deep fried shredded kailan leafs) was good but not the sort of good that left me shouting from the mountain tops.The service at this place was good and efficient. Our plates were constantly changed as fish bones and crab shells piled on. We even saw a waitress patiently cracking open the shells and extracting the crab meat for an elderly couple who I guess did not quite enjoy the whole 'digging in with your hands' eating experience.Overall, an excellent dining experience. Nice ambience to have a good catching up session over a hardy meal which makes the slightly pricier bill worth it
4
We came here with friends for the black pepper crab. It was delicious. Location is overlooking Marina Bay and the Marina Bay Sands hotel. If you time it right you can finish dinner at the right time to watch the lazer light show. Yes, we got the fish skins and the pickles and yes they charged for them. We ate them and they were delicious. We were staying at the MBS hotel so it was a nice walk and the location was why we chose the restaurant.
4
I've eaten in a few seafood restaurants here in Singapore, but Palm Beach at One Fullerton does have a beautiful night view that is pretty hard to beat. The weather was cool and breezy. We had the Creamy Crab with steamed Man Tou's and it was pretty good. Since there were only three of us we ordered 3 items and struggled to finish the portion. I would go back to try different items. Is it the best? No I have had better but not in Singapore. Overall it's passable
3
I made a reservation for a friend's birthday dinner. I chose the indoor seating as my friends and I were intolerant of the Singapore heat. This turned out to be a bad choice. The aircon was not cold and we felt warm and uncomfortable throughout the dinner. The table next to us had two young children who were wailing from time to time. Luckily we had a table next to the window which commanded a perfect view of the Marina Bay and MBS. The food was also excellent and we enjoyed every single dish. Service was fair. Some waiters were very efficient and knowledgeable while others were quite clueless about the menu.I would highly recommend sitting outdoors. The last time I ate this restaurant, we opted for outdoor seating and the night breeze made the Singapore heat tolerable. The views from the outdoor seating area were also more breath-taking.I spent about $450 for 3 persons (ie. $150 per person). We had crab, fish and prawns so I assume the price was appropriate
5
Came across this restaurant by chance. I immediately zoned in on the Crab curry. What an amazing meal plus the views and location were spot on. The service was okay but I am not complaining as the food was good.Will definitely recommend and will go back there again
1
Came here as it had a breathtaking night scenery view, for my visiting guests.Order the chef's special "PRAWN with VERMICELLI", to my shock, I saw the small shrimp had it's PINCER attached??? (Note : This is the common hard-shelled blue-shrimp that prawning ponds in Singapore use! It is low-grade and commonly found in freshwater sewers and drains....where they belong...)I asked the waiter if it was a FRESHWATER PRAWN and he said yes to it as well. Checked the menu and saw no mention of the shrimp type stating if it was freshwater or saltwater. If I had knew it was shrimps from FRESHWATER SEWERS, i would have NEVER ORDERED IT. Such a disgust. really
3
Went during dinner time.ProsGood locationIndoor and outdoor seatings availableHuge servingsPopular with business associates and tourists.Opt for outdoor setting, able to view the MBS and laser show at 8pm.Nearest MRT to restaurant Raffles Place MRT.Accept reservation in advanceConsPrices are too expensive given in a restaurant settings ranging from 698++ to 1688++ for 10 pax.IMO, i think its too noisy for corporate meals.Service was not really professional given the amount spent.I rate a 5/10. Save your money and go to hawker centre to eat instead. It costs less than S$100.See my menu for pricings
4
Beautiful location and view. Food was good, if a little pricey. Excellent service. Try the set meals, the fresh fruit dessert was simply fantastic.
4
The best part of this restaurant is the location! Situated right on the water across from Marina Sands Hotel, it is a wonderful place to sit and watch the world go by. The food was very plentiful but minimal options for non-seafood eaters.
2
Were told about the amazing Chilli Crab at this place, but it was a bit disappointing - not very tasty. The crab was fresh but because they were very busy, the waitresses spend the whole night trying to rush you. The most audacious thing was that they gave you a bowl of crispy fried salted fish skins + some pickled vegies as an appetiser but then proceeded to charge you for it at the end of the meal WITHOUT TELLING YOU!!! They also charged for the wet towelettes. Don't bother with this restaurant. There are heaps of better seafood places in Singapore
2
It was entirely my own fault. Instead of reading the reports from Tripadvisor reviewers, I went to Palm Beach Seafood at the enthusiastic urging of a good friend whose advice is usually exemplary. In my opinion, Palm Beach is no better than average in most respects, except one, namely charging, where they excel. I refer here to the unasked-for appetizers (the SGD 5 fish skins and the SGD 2 pickles), and the charge for the wet towels, as commented on by many other reviewers.The bottom line: If you want crab, you can do better than Palm Beach Seafood
4
We had eaten here many years ago before the Marina Bay development, loved the food and wanted to try it again. We were not disappointed, more crowded than previously but this is obviously due to the light show and to the improved view.I can't agree to previous comments as we found the service to be good and our waiter very helpful with menu suggestions.We only wanted a light meal, no crab dishes but all of our dishes were served hot and promptly, all very tasty and nicely presented, especially loved the prawn soup.Only negative is that the tables are too close together
5
The food here is very good with helpful staffs. The booking is accurate and effective better by phone than web since it is quite slow to contact back. The size of the seafood like crab and lobster is really large. I had crab at 2.4 Kg and lobster at 3.5 kg. Cooking is very tasty. The location is at Fullerton which the atmosphere is quite good with very good view especially at night. I visit this restaurant everytime I visit Singapore
3
We wanted to try the famous chilli crabs in Singapore and found this restaurant by the marina with a great view but were disappointed with pretty much everything else.The crab was fresh but average , the alcohol pricey and we felt that for the 10% included service charge the service could have been better
4
You'll pay a pretty premium price for the specialty - Pepper Crab - but the location/view are excellent. Good fans outside help keep visitors cool. Beers are also pricey - like most dining establishments in Singapore. Every 40 minutes or so, there is a light/laser show over the marina from the Sands Hotel.. this is a great place to sit and watch while you eat
5
My wife and I enjoyed a serious feast at Palm Beach; located on the Singapore waterfront. Excellent food - crispy squid, outrageously large/tasty/spicy Pepper Crab, excellent veggies. Chli Crab of course available as well. Tiger Beer washes it all down. Attention service; reservations a must. You want to sit outside under their canopy, looking out to the new Singapore skyline. Bring $$$! All credit cards accepted. Easy to reach and return home by taxi
3
If it weren't for the location this would be just another chilli crab place in Singapore. The obligatory munchies while waiting for food don't look appealing. Cooked fish and fried squid are fine but nothing special. Service is slow and poor. We had to cancel an appetizer satay that had not arrived by the end of our meal. Marina Bay is truly handsome at this spot, especially when there's a laser light show. But this place is extremely crowded, narrowly packed and very noisy. You are forced to listen to everybody's conversations and phone calls
3
We had a wonderful dinner here, the chile crab was fantastic. The service, however, was horrible...The rice was on the table 10 minutes before the crab arrived, and when it did it was cold. 10 minutes later a new crab arrived...it was spectacular!
3
Chilly Crab was very tasty
Fried Chicken was ok
Fried rice was not recommended
Tofu Bok choy was average
Fruits:
Mangosteen, Jambu, melon were okb
Mango was sour and not sweet
4
The food was good and the prices fair, but without the location, it would be just another restaurant.
4
I was taken here by some Singapore natives and put myself in their hands and they ordered. We started with fried Salmon skins and kimchi like nibbles. OK but hardly a treat. My setting came with a big wet wipe and a finger bowl.Some prawn soup and ginseng, quite tasty and time to get one's hands in the food. Soup better than prawns, but good none the less. Next came some deep fried calamari stuffed with calamai-burger or some such - niceBeef in a dark sauce with Peking duck style-pancakes was messy and good. Ramping up.But the hit of the evening was the Chili Crab. Even though we had eaten well already, we demolished it with pleasure. It made me wonder what the other 10 or so crab sauces and cooking methods would produce - I could spend a pleasant couple of weeks finding out.So I recommend it. If you think you can go and not get your hands into the food with relish, I think you should stay away. At the table next to us 4 conventioneers ordered a Chili crab, stared at it, tasted the sauce, and then left almost all of it.The Argentine wine we had seemed to be an indifferent Sauvingon Blanc, I think I'd just do big Tiger beers next time. You can get a nice Cognac and stare at the harbor to wrap it up. We luckily had a nice evening to sit outside, I'm not sure outside would be the best choice on a hot day.Some people complain about their service, but my Singapore hosts would brook no nonsense, so maybe just be a bit pushy if things seem slow
4
Our hotel concierge made the reservation for us. We arrived early and were given an outdoor seat immediately - it was early in the evening. We ordered the chili crab, to share. It cost about 100 Singapore dollars and the maitre' d was very up front about the price. I'm used to Dungeness crab so the Sri Lankan mud crab is a new experience. The shell was so hard I had to ask a waiter to assist cracking it completely so I could get at the meat. If you are not used to eating cracked crab with chop sticks, it's quite a challenge! We also ordered some sides of vegetables, and a Tiger beer. Our seat gave us a great view of the harbor and we were there for the laser light show that is put on at the Marina Bay Sands resort across the harbor and it is a great spectacle. Overall, the food was OK. I had chili crab at the outdoor Newton Food Center and that is also good, though a very different environment (if you go there, check prices at a few vendors to be sure you are not overpaying). Go to the Palm Beach for the view and a good meal

A great place to eat Chili Crab, a Singapore specialty. Sit outside at night and watch the riverboats, the Merlion Fountain and all the interesting people. One crab is enough for two but this is really a messy dish and few restaurants provide napkins. Also, beware of the fried eel skins. Good if you don’t know what you’re eating, just a little fishy

Would have loved to sit outside and ate under the stars right on the water, but inside was where they had tables open so we took it. Interior was beat up and not indicative of its name Palm Beach. Tried baby squid which was very crunchy and different than calimari and the bok choy was delicious. We ordered the chili crab and was disappointed on two fronts: 1) Asked waiter for help on best way to eat and he said to grab a piece (really?) 2) It was the messiest and hardest food I've EVER eaten and everyone at our table said the same thing...never again.Pros: Right on the water, Tanks filled with live seafood that go to cook then to tableCons: Interior a bit run down, wait staff not very helpful, crab was more mess than it is worthReal Question: No - I would not go back, partly because there are so many other places to try and this one just did not stand out enough

Not only was this restaurant over-priced, the service was only OK, and the food was average. We had chili-crab, and our party of 4 was charged for napkins. Seriously! They tried to put appetizers on the table that we didn't ask for and didn't want (and were not free). We had many good meals in Singapore, and this was not one of them. Maybe I'm being too kind to give 3 dots..

Well, we had dinner at Ku De Ta, saw the city skyline by night. But missed the laser light show, as we were having dinner inside, only saw some flashes here and there. Next day we had dinner at this place, beside good seafood, enjoyed light show with music. Food was good, mixed drinks from bar were so-so, and service was excellent.
2
I've been to this restaurant twice and the food is OK. I won't say it's spectacular. It sits right next to Merlion and has a good view to Sands which is great for the light show. However on receiving the bill I found that they charged SGD$5 for fish skin, SGD$2 for pickles and SGD$0.8 per wet towel and that was not communicated to me (for consolation, they did not charge for the napkins when you have crab...). This is not something I'm not happy with and they should not rip people off this way
4
Great location, a bit expensive for the quality of food it offers.
Its good for when u first visit, more of a touristy place than local...
3
This review would get 5 stars if the service levels were better. The night we went was extremely busy to be fair but orders were forgotten, drinks delayed and nerves frayed all around. However the actual food itself was very good - great choice of seafood. And the view across the marina bay spectacular

I visited Palm Beach at One Fullerton on the evening of 6th Jan with my colleagues and an overseas business guest. We ordered, amongst several dishes, 2 crabs - one done with white pepper and the other in chilli sauce. We requested for smaller Sri Lankan crabs of around 1.2kg each as we were having 2 crab dishes but were specifically told by the wait staff that the smallest available was 1.6 kg. Given that explanation, we proceeded to order 2 X 1.6 kg .When the chilli crab was served, they certainly did not look like they were 1.6kg. We gave it the benefit of doubt and commenced eating . When the second dish of white pepper crabs came, we again noticed that it looked much smaller than 1.6kg. We asked the waitress to check with the kitchen on the weight of the crabs we had been served. She returned after several minutes and apologized for the "mistake".Indeed, we had been served 1.2kg for the white pepper crab dish. We then asked if the earlier chilli crab dish was 1.6 kg as ordered. Her answer was no. That too was actually 1.2 kg. What was appalling was that she did not tell us about the "mistake" in the weight of the chilli crab till we asked .Can there really be 2 identical errors in 2 dishes?Crabs are Palm Beach's specialty.If we, laymen can tell that the crabs do not look like 1.6kg , how can someone who handles crabs every day not know?We could have very easily been overcharged by 800g in total ( @ $60/kg ) ! Money aside and although the restaurant eventually charged us for what was served, the entire experience left a very bad impression on us, in particular on my overseas guest I had written to the management about this issue a fortnight ago. To date, I have not received a respons

Going to dinner with local friends we were looking forward to an authentic Singapore treat - so we were a little taken aback when we rocked up to this place on the Marina which was clearly very touristy. But anyhow were happy to go along and see what happens.We sat down outside of course with the spectacular views onto the Marina Bay Sands area and light shows. We were very lucky with our server (a young Chinese lady) who was absolutely flawless, she even deshelled the crab for us (only available when the place is not too busy). I have never seen that much meat come off a crab. Every dish we ordered was excellent. The sticky pork rib starters were among the best BBQ I have ever had anywhere as where the various vegetable dishes with ordered.One tip: try the black pepper crab instead of the Singapore chilli crab and just get some chilli crab sauce on the side with some steamed buns. Attached some pictures for you to salivate over :)Yes it is expensive, around $100pp but it is Excellent, dont miss it
2
Food was ... OK ... But not worth the money -- very mediocre. Service verging on bad .... Did these guys get hired yesterday? For a restaurant charging *these* prices, service has to match price. Forget the "light-show" b-s .... It is pathetic and adds zero value to your eating experience
4
It is a great restaurant we did not have any experience about crab before but they helped us a lot. You get a little bit messy but it is worth it try the chili crab and accompany it with white cold wine excellent view to the Marina and of the laser sho

After 8 years away we passed through Singapore and met up with a number of Singaporian friends for dinner. I left it up to them to order the food which was very good. We sat outside and the view across the bay is worth the visit alone. Chilli Crab was as it should be, lots of sauce and messy to eat
4
Decided on this based on its location. There are 2 seatings to maximise revenue, 6 and 8pm. We opted for 6pm as my colleagues have an early flight the next dayWe started with an appetiser platter of fried squid, soft shell crab and razor clams, they were okWe ordered 2 crabs, 1 butter and the other chilli. The butter crab was ok, but didn't wow. The chilli crab was slightly worse, the versions at Jumbo , No signboard, Red house and Long beach are all betterWe did like the drunken prawns though. And the fruit platter was amazing - rambutan, mango, mangosteen and jackfruit. All very exotic and very good fruitIt's about 3 stars for the food, and 1 star added for the view. You see the marina bay sands hotel and its light show at 8pm, and the merlion is just steps away. The service is also competentThis place is expensive though. $100per crab and $180 for 20 small glasses of bee
2
The only good thing I can say about this restaurant is that it has a great location with a beautiful view. Everything else is bad. We ordered the Chili Crab famous in Singapore. The taste of the crab was completely overwhelmed by the chili sauce and it was very messy to eat. The one crab cost about $100 US. It was so messy that we asked for two more packaged wet wipes. They brought them and charged $1.50 each for them. In addition they bought out a starter of fried fish skin. We did not order and it appeared to be part of the meal. Not so, another $5.00 bucks. Food was not good, very expensive, and nothing Asian about it at all. Could have been in Disney World or Las Vegas. There are much better places to eat Chili crab
3
the service here was very good, the staff took the crabs out for you to choose and these were served up cooked as per request. extensive menu of additions to the seafood on offer. over priced but to be expected given the location, toilets need attention as left me feeling i didn't want to see the kitchen
4
We had a great chili crab here while watching the laser show on the other side of the water.
Not the friendliest staff, but certainly a 'must do' when visiting Singapore.
3
Worth a visit for some tasty seafood, informal, almost feet in the water, Marina Bay in front, a nice breeze luckily...dinner with colleagues, all just arrived in town, so just a bit shakened. Black pepper crab is good! But almonds prawn are even better!
4
Restaurant was in a beautiful location overlooking Marina Bay and we were seated al fresco which was lovely so that we could see the light show and have a view. We had the Singapore crab which was delicious. However would call this more of a tame experience because they target market was defintiely ex pats. I'd go back again, especially if staying at or near the Fullerton because it's so convenient. Price was good value considering the location at about $250 for 4.
3
We visited Palm Beach Seafood following recommendations. We were told it was the best place for Singapore chilli crab. Because we were flying later that evening we booked our table for 530pm - opening. You'd think this would mean our meal would be trouble free. But no! Service was patchy to say the least. Starters didn't show up and we waited over an hour for our main dishes. Whole busloads of people had been served and away! On the whole the food was okay but the service was awful and the food very ambitiously priced for what it was. Try one of Sinagpores street cafes for some chilli crab instead.
5
We were recommended this place by the concierge of Marina Bay Sands! The sea food is really there speciallity. We obviously choose the famous chilli crab which was absolutely delicious. While dinning we could freely enjoy the daily laser show just in front of us in the Marina Bay. It was a Friday night and was quite crowded... Look to be a very popular place for the youth there. We were there at around 8pm but as we did not have any reservation we had to wait 9h30 to have a nice table in first position on the waterfront. Time for us to have one or two drinks in the pub just beside..
5
We have been invited by the famlies of business partners from us on a Saturday night in this restaurant. Beautiful skyline with casino. The food was great. Especially the Black Pepper Crab was remarkable. But all fish was very well prepared with fresh ingredients. All dishes have their own special touch from the cook. Go there. I haven't paid the bill, so I don't know how much it has cost. They have round tables inside. Very nice when you are with a larger group; we were with eight. Service was OK. They were alert
4
Sitting by the water with an unobstructed view of Marina Bay Sands - Singapore's latest landmark, the place is excellent for bringing foreign guests to. Are there better places for chilli crab? yes! Are there better places for other dishes on the menu? Yes! But for the combination of good ambience, great view, really good service and a decent meal, nothing else comes close in Singapore
4
Recommended by our hotel concierge as one of the best and we agree - we very much enjoyed our Chilli crab - large, well cooked. it also has a perfect spot to watch the evening light and music shows across Marina Bay - book ahead as its very popular with locals. as everywhere in Singapore wine is expensive so stick to beer
4
Visited this restaurant for dinner after our hotel concierge suggested and booked it for us when we asked where to go for chilli crab. We ordered the crispy baby squid, fragrant tofu and chilli crab with rice. A lot of food for 2 people, even with choosing the small serves for the squid and tofu. Having said that, I liked how you could choose different sizes so you could order more dishes. The squid is really crunchy, we thought it would've been salt and pepper style but it was in a thick dark sticky sauce. As stated in other reviews, you need to pay for the appetizers so if you don't want it, ask the wait staff to take it away. We sat on the outside deck and it was a really great atmosphere. This provided front row seats for the laser show at 8pm. Yes it is expensive, but you are also paying for the location and atmosphere.
5
Wen visiting Singapore on a business trip, we came here for our last night dinner and it was 100% worth it!! First of all, the enviorment was great, full of people and full of life!! View is absolutely breath taking!Have nothing to say about the food other than the fact that it was amazing, the chillie crabs are to die for and the rest of the dishes ( we had at least 5 more) were delicious!! This restaurant is a must when going to Singapore!!
4
We had like 4-course dinner with relatively big portions. The crab was good and the views are breath-taking
4
Although I have a lot of crab dish in Thailand, the chili crab here is still so delicious. I would recommend all my friend to try this restaurant. Spectacular view, and unforgettable chili crab.
4
Very good location to watch the Laser Show at 8PM and 9:30Pm. Food was very good and portions were large. Don't over-order unless you're in a group of 4 or more. Setting is right on the Harbour at One Fullerton. Crab was spectacular, but large.
3
Sitting outside is a must, highlight of evening is overlooking Marina Bay. Service is slow but we didn't mind thanks to outdoor seating. You're paying for location and views of SIngapore....the Pepper and Chili crabs are very good but overpriced.
5
The concierge of the Fullerton booked us in - and we were very very happy we went. Its a magical location at night - with the MBS lightshow and the Merlion (book an outdoor table). The chilli crab was WONDERFUL - and the rest of the food was great too. Its a busy place, so you do need to book
4
Our hosts took us here for dinner, specifically for the chili crabs. They were big, plump and definitely tasty. The sauce was very savory and would definitely go well with steamed rice, except our hosts didn't order any. Instead, to soak up the delicious sauce, you have buns. It was heavenly, though a little messy. I didn't miss the rice one bit.We sat outdoors, facing the Merlion, which was simply magnificent. However, being in tropical Singapore, it can get sticky because of the heat and humidity. Good thing, there's the sea breeze and, again, the delicious crabs to take your mind off it
4
I ate here with colleagues and as three of us were from out of town it was an ideal spot. We sat outside at one of the tables closest to the water, so we could see the laser show at the Sands at 8pm (not very exciting, but nice as a dinner show).We had a selection of food, which was nice - good portions and flavour etc. It wasn't very exciting but it was enjoyable. Four of the table shared a chili crab, and were presented with bibs - it was apparently delicious
4
Dinner for 8 pax. As part of entertaining out of town guest.Great flavor in the crabs. Set meal was really good. Our highlights were the crispy baby squid. Prawn in superior both and creamy crab. Great for business meal. Setting is good at 1 Fullerton.
3
We ordered shrimp and chicken and rice. Shrimp is very good and fresh. Chicken is fried so it's little dried. Service is poor. There are few waiters but they have been talking among themselves and ignore their customers. the waitress who served our table seemed new and did not known anything about the menu
5
This is so well placed near the marina with a view across to the Marina Bay Sands and you see the laser light show in the distance. Great food. Sit outside. Plenty of action but still enough privacy. Walk along the waterfront later. Wait for a table - it doesn't take too long. Better than Boat Quay restaurants which can be a total rip-off
4
Excellent food but rather slow on service. It is evidently extremely popular and was packed on the night we ate there. Crabs and seafood were the main items on the menu.
4
Loved the signature dish and also the crispy baby squid. Anything else on the dishes was just so so.
4
Having done some research on Singapore's culinary scene, I found out that Palm Beach is where the chilli crab was born, so it made sense to go to this restaurant. I don't like egg, so opted for the black pepper crab instead, which was absolutely delicious. Even though it is quite a high-end restaurant, diners are welcome to eat with their hands and splatter all over the table cloths which is quite good fun.The only downside is that it is a little expensive, so it is more of a splurge on your trip, and unfortunately I was charged double the price by mistake (which I stupidly only noticed on the receipt after I travelled back home :/)
4
Generally good service and the food come out reasonably quickly. However, probably because it is quite busy it didn't pay attention on the order it needs to come out. Our vegetables come out first, then the fish (Honey Tangy Fish), then the crab. Which should really be the other way around usually.Everything was superbly cooked, and the view was great and surprisingly not very hot at night. Just like to make a comment on another reviewer's mention of "appetisers" and being charged for. This is a common practice in most Chinese restaurants in Singapore, Hong Kong and China to charge for "condiments, appetisers and tea". Also to another reviewer who mentioned about service fee, again common practice in restaurants in Singapore. If you are happy with the food or service you can always tip the restaurant, unlike in the US where gratitude is expected.I think reviewers should pay attention to each countries norm and culture before making comments like those.Will return to this restaurant if we have a chance before we leave Singapore
4
Arrived around 9pm without a reservation and were told a table would be available in a half hour. We could see the place was packed so a quick walk to the Merlion and the light show from the Marina Bay Sands easily accounted for the half hour. Were shown to a table indoors and menus presented hurriedly. The waitress hovered for our order without even asking if we would like a drink. After a brief explanation of the price of the crabs we ordered a whole chilli crab and a whole pepper crab. These were both Siri Lankan and marginally smaller and cheaper than the Australian crabs on offer. We were then provided with bibs and the whole crabs were served promptly. No complaints about either dish although a side plate to put broken shells on would have been handy. Found the whole experience a bit rushed but the food was very good and the location exceptional. Maybe next time I will stick to East Coast Parkway for crabs which are a bit cheaper and served in more casual surroundings
4
We had dinner with colleagues here for a CNY Lo Hei.Quality of the Lo Hei is pretty good! We ordered pork ribs, chilies crab and of course the most amazing dish is the Alaska Crab. Enjoy the crabs fiesta and range of wine selections.Overall is very good but slight pricey
4
We invited 10 guests from Australia to a per wedding dinner and we chose Palm Beach Seafood at One Fullerton We took our own wine and we started with a salad tossing followed by roast chicken, BBq pork chops, vegetables along with 7kilos of chilli and Pepper crabs. The presentation was excellent and the taste was very good. The service was excellent for a Friday nigh and the Marina Sands light show added to the ambience. Overall cost including corkage fee the bill came to just over $1000Strongly recommend especially for visitors a great place to get a taste of Singaporean cuisine Well done Palm Beach Seafoo
4
This was not our first time at this restaurant. We go here specifically for chilli crabs but also pepper crabs. I would highly recommend a table outside so you can enjoy a magic atmosphere under the Singapore sky while you overlook Marina Bay.In our opinions the crabs here are excellent, although the place is definitely a bit pricey. The feeling of a light breeze with your cold drink and these very tasty crabs however makes it worthwhile every now and then. Without doubt is one place that should be tried at least once whether you are a traveller or a living here
4
I tried their Chinese food for a quick lunch after a business meeting. It was high quality and very satisfying. Service staff were well trained and knowledgeable. The view from this restaurant is amazing, over looking the marina bay sands hotel. Although sitting outside can be a little warm in the hot singapore sun.
3
Went here for great chilli crab as per the reviews, and wanted to try this famous Singaporean dish whilst visiting from the UK.Well the table and view of the Merlion and Marina Bay Sands was amazing, but the menu is completely incomprehensible!!! We were brought appetizers, not sure what any of it was, and didn't have a clue what to order or how from the menu!!! The crab took AGES and loads of other people were served before else, despite chasing. When it came it was delicious, but didn't warrant the very expensive bill! Would not recommend
4
The Chili and the Pepper Crab are very good, try it. We were there yesterday for a Chili and Pepper Crab lunch with friends.
It was very enjoyable, Go there and try it..... You will not regret it.
5
This restaurant has great food, specifically black pepper chili crab. The location is great too, right across from the Marina Bay Sands. Go at night to avoid the heat.
3
When we arrived we were so happy with the location and view from our table, appetizers were put on our table immediately (we didn't ask for them) which we did not really like however thought a nice gesture, food was good however we waited 1.5 hours for our crab while other tables food came, we followed up numerous times... Finally it came (over it by then) the final straw was when the bill came- charged for the fish skin/appetizers we did not even order AND charged $7 per wet towel ($35 for towel!) this was removed from our bill after we expressed our disgust however we would never return
3
I've been coming to this place for a few years and the main reason is the location. You're very close to the Fullerton hotel and if seated outdoor you can enjoy a wonderful view embracing some of the nicest landmarks of Marina Bay: the Merlion, the Esplanade, Marina Bay Sands hotel, the lotus-flower-shaped ArtScience Museum. The food is quite good: I usually have a fish starter (prawns are worth) and then celebrate being in Singapore with a Black Pepper Crab, which is as delicious as challenging to eat. The crabs are normally flown from Sri Lanka therefore are quite expensive. For cheaper food and almost the same quality you might have many options, particularly the hawkers centres like Lau Pa Sat nevertheless the vista truly deserves one visit. I agree with many TA reviewers's comments that the service may be annoyngly slow sometimes
2
Recommended by our hotel. What a disappointment. Terribly expensive - I wouldn't mind if the food had been good. Unfortunately the service was terribly slow. The food was poor. We expected to eat Chili Crab which everyone told us we must try. It was poor - without taste and extremely expensive. The location is great and the atmosphere ok. Huge let down. Will never recommend nor eat here again. I dislike poor reviews, but this merits it
4
I picked this place for any overseas friends new to Singapore, here for both the seafood and its location. The food are a little pricey so we always come for dinner to also get a more romantic view of Marina bay. Outdoor sitting would be nice when the weather is cool, otherwise, the air-conditioned would be very useful especially when working with the crabs, prawns and chilli! A good variety of seafood to choose from but we normally have the signature dish, jumbo sized chilli or pepper mud crabs (ordered in advance for the huge ones - about 3kg). Do check on the seafood prices when ordering. Other than seafood, the pork buns are very tasty.
3
There is no doubt that this restaurant holds a prime position for a great view of the Merlion statue and Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The food, however, was a disappointment. There was no finesse in the presentation, nor excitement in the flavours (we had two crabs, with two different sauces including chilli) to warrant a better rating. Service was pretty basic, although reasonably prompt. There was a full crowd, and I guess it must be a pretty popular venue to bring foreign friends. Go for the view, but then again, there are better alternatives for dinner in Singapor
4
While looking for a place to entertain some overseas friends, a colleague recommended this restaurant for dinner. Being on the riverfront close to the Merlion statue, it was not difficult to locate although finding nearby parking was not as easy to find. The location gave the restuarant a fabulous view of the Singapore skyline and was very pleasant in the early evening when the weather is cooler.Naturally, seafood is the speciality here - fresh ingredients, well cooked and tasty. Absolutely loved the chilli crab although found the milk prawns so-so. I agree with other reviewers that prices are high, so come prepared to pay. Service was not so good but fairly typical for many Singapore restaurants - attentive at times but otherwise somewhat elusive. Apart from the food , the resturant is a prime location for watching the laser light show at 8.00 pm originating from the Marina Bay Sands resort directly opposite - choose outdoor seating if this is desired
3
In my nearly 50 years of life, this was by far the most expensive experience. My old friend in Singapore booked this restaurant. We sat down outside and could enjoy the nice view. We ordered several dishes and big nice crab. We drank beer and a bottle of white wine. The service was below average, they did not come unless we called. We were shocked by the price...$600!!! The crab cost nearly $300. What an expensive seafood! One time experience was more than enough
3
Pepper Crab is a must have at Palms. It melts in your mouth and sauce is simply out of this world. we (two people) ordered One perpper crab, one chilli Crab and two veg dishes - plus a pitcher of Beer. The total bill fro the dinner was $380 SIN Dollar!! (approx $350)WOW.... great food and a memorable price for sure...By the way, for the folks visiting from the US, they charge for the napkins $1 per piece !!!
4
This is because of the black pepper crab, and the fried shrimp with almond toasts.
4
Great, buzzy restaurant - need to book ahead as it can get very busy. Ask for the chefs recommendations - they do amazing local crab dishes
5
Great experience, food wonderful - highly recommend.
4
Their crabs are delicious, and their dimsum dishes yummy; first time I tasted Tiger Beer and loved it...
2
While the food is certainly important in assessing a restaurant, customer service is also key and unfortunately in this area Palm Beach fares terribly. We had booked a table for an evening dinner during the week and despite the fact that we had been told that the reservation was valid for a 15 min slot, when we arrived at the place, no table was available.... No real effort was made to find an alternative solution, probably because the place has a natural crowd passing by and looking for dinner places in the area which would ensure it gets sufficient patrons anyway. For me, the lack of consideration shown is certainly enough to put me off

Okay, so first up we don't eat crab, but it is on the list of things to do in Singapore so we decided to give it a go. This restaurant had good reviews and was close to our hotel so we headed in for chilli crab. We didn't book but as it was around 2pm we had no trouble securing a table. So we had to choose a type and size of crab, which we did with assistance from the lovely waitress, we also ordered some bbq pork pancakes for one in our party who didn't want to give the crab a go. So after a couple of Singapore slings our crab arrives, and at this point we realise that we have no idea how to eat the thing. So much to the amusement of the staff we managed to get some of the crab in our mouths and plenty over the table, floor and ourselves, this was such a fun experience (I imagine if you know how to eat a crab it wouldn't be as much fun), the staff eventually offered to help us by cracking open some of the legs and pincers. The meal was lovely, I am not sure if it is the best chilli crab in Singapore as I have nothing to compare it to, but I can only suggest you a least have some fun and give it a go
4
Chili Crab was good, Pepper Crab and Baby Squid were all very good, service was slow and inattentive at times. Not a fancy place, smart casual attire is fine. You can pick your own seafood from wall of aquariums in the back if you so choose
5
probably one of the best seafood restaurant in Singapore, on themarina with a breath-taking view of buildings around (and a light show at 8 pm).all seafood is good, entrees are delicious and nicely served.what I can't really miss when I'm in Singapore is the black pepper crab... very popular in this area and made at perfection at PalmBeach.A bit pricey, I'm still struggling to find a cheap place in Singapore ! but very enjoyable, great service too.recommend to book in advance, it's always packed
1
Been there before with larger parties and it was ok but this time it was me and my spouse. We offered two apps pepper crab and noodles. Noodles never arrived and the waiter didn't care. When you need something you have to wave your arms like a crazy person. We had to remind them to take the noodles off the bill. Food was was pricey because of the location I understand but at least give us reasonable service. I guess when you add on the service charge they don't care how your experience is as long they get their money. NEVER AGAIN

A friend from Canada read about this resto it in a book and got a few good reviews thus on one of my trips to Singapore went with her to the resto.. they normally only accept u with a reservation. We didn't know this and just ended up there.. we requested them to get us a table if possible and they really obliged and did so in about 30 mins..we ordered the Singapore Chilly Crab with was yumm.. but i hear the pepper crab is much better.. so if i do go next time i shall try that..would surely recommend it.
