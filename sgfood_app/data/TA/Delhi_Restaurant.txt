Being from Delhi though to try this restaurant ,No complaints about the food the Service is really terrible and we were not the only one complaining about it
4
The place doesn't look great but the food is really nice. The staff is very good. Wouldn't mind going again.
3
food is normal punjabi however its costly in this area u can get better and cheaper food for sure. but surey u can try once.
5
It's our first visit. We love the food and Great Service. Must Try the Butter Chicken and Chilli Prawn.
4
A very good place for trying authentic Indian food. Good service and staff are very friendly. Good selection of signature dishes like Mix grill Sizler, Butter Chicken and Mutton Rogan Josh.. Highly recommended...

I usually donâ€™t like writing bad reviews. I ignore most of the times. This place used to be our favourites now has stooped to the lowest. The food is not as good as it used to be but we didnâ€™t make too much fuzz about it. The service is Soo Soo bad I cannot imagine. Manager is a very nice person but the waiters some home feel as if they are bosses and donâ€™t know how to talk or behave. Food quality is just below 0. I gave 10 /10 around 1 year back. Now if you want to spoil your evening go here.

We chose Delhi from many restaurants in this strip as the staff were helpful but not pushy out the front. We had a very tasty Chicken Jelfrezi, Aloo Baingan, Chicken Biryani, Roti and Paratha. The food was very tasty and reasonable size portions. The staff very friendly and service efficient. We had eaten at the Banana Leaf Apolo a few nights earlier and enjoyed the Delhi much better and it was cheaper.
3
We went here for Friday night dinner with friends,the place was packed but we squeezed into a corner table.The service is a little chaotic but the staff do try and are helpful and smiley We ordered various sizzle platters to share with rice and two veggie sides.The waiter flames the sizzle platters at the table which is a fun touch.The veggie platter was delicious with a good mix of veg and well spiced My friends were also tucking happily into their meat and fish ones.The portions are big enough to share easily and even though we were all hungry we had to admit defeat
2
I went for dinner only to find out the fave voucher can't be used for dinner. Even before this I wasn't comfortable, the beer I'd ordered was sour, the waiter couldn't assist with menu advice and the staff are generally distant and unfriendly. Thus was before I'd asked about using our voucher.This was our second visit, over a year apart and our last experience wasn't favourable (without a voucher), dishes were average and not fresh cooked. We only returned when I noticed the fave voucher and thought we'd give it a second chance. We will discard our unused voucher rather than dine there again
3
This is one of the better restaurants in Little India maybe as it's coming up to the annual festival they were packed and rushed off their feet still they were polite and courteous so it was really noisy which distressed my Wife. The food was average and could be improved. We had the mushroom matter, plain palak that arrived full of cheese, lamb Seth and chicken tikka. We will return in future
4
If you are craving for naan, look no further! We had ordered a few dishes to share for both of us and it turns out great. Service was good too. I wish I know this place earlier.
4
Ate here for the first time almost 15 years ago. Came back again and I must say that the food quality is still very authentic and delicious. Service is good and price is reasonable.
5
This northern indian restaurant has been here for a very long time as I have patronised it since 1995. Good service, nice ambient, great good likt palek paneer with extra methi, butter chicken, mix grill, and many others.
4
We ordered palak paneer and butter chicken and these were delicious but even the very mild was too hot for my dining partner.
I really enjoyed the meal and the cold beer was especially refreshing.
Loved it.
5
I went there with family for breakfast . Nice food , good service, very clean. Must recommended. Try pindi channa with poori.
Very good taste .
5
Went here with three colleagues, of which one local who insisted on this place.We shared the black pepper shrimps, butter chicken and lamb vindaloo. Plus a naan mixed platter and rice. All the dishes were excellent. Perhaps black pepper shrimp was the best, but it was a close race.We hade mango lassi, mango kulfi and masala tea. The kulfi was awesome and a perfect finale for this excellent dinner.Will remember this place for a very long time
5
Dinner and birthday celebration at this restaurant.Service is really good and the restaurant places customer service as priority. Not only they do their best to customise food for our pure vegetarian Friend but also along the way help to play a part for the surprise birthday cake appearance. Food is good. Ordered a lot and all gone!!! Portion is big too so for small eaters maybe can have two portions for 3 pax to share.Most amazing is that one can earn travel points when dining here. I earned 57 Points (equivalent to USD 57) which is more than 20% of the total bill in SGD!!! If you like authenticity and also loves to travel, hit me up to find out how you can eat and earn points for Travelling :) You are welcome to leave a message or electronic contact me at r c k o n g at(symbol) y a h o o dot (punctuation) c o m Have a great feast at this restaurant :

There is a lot of choice in Little India - indeed in all of Singapore - but I make a point of visiting Delhi Restaurant whenever I have a chance because the food is invariably first class. The prices are very reasonable - and there is an extensive selection of dishes available. I also like the fact that very cold beer can be purchased to go with the hot curries. You know this place does a good job because many locals eat there. To be clear: this is a relaxed family run business with a casual atmosphere. Highly recommended for a fun experience
4
The food was delicious at this place. It was very busy at the time I went on a Sunday, so will have to take into account the service was not 5 star. There is a restaurant immediately next to it, but I liked eating inside at a floor level above the one next door!! Will return here next time in SGP
2
Loved the food here but will probably never visit again due to it's terrible service. The starters and main course were served almost together. The staff didn't even bother to get our dessert after the meal, had to wait ten minutes to get their attention to remind them of it
4
Very fine restaurant...It have all different types of Indian dishes in menu...The price is too reasonable.... very healthy environment..... very fast service.... and the food is also tasty.... a must visit for Indians especially....ðŸ˜Š
5
Always great food and good service. Was better when you ordered through the staff and not via an iPad!
4
Delhi Restaurant in Race Course Road is a very good Northern Indian Restaurant. Prices are very reasonable
2
Had their lunch buffet at $15++. The Punjabi guy working there showed a disgruntled face and passed us the menu selection to choose and asked us whether we knew terms n conditions. Out of 2 starters, 1 came towards end of our meal.Kashmiri fish wasn't fresh. Chinese lady server was always on her phone. We were not entitled for the one for one masala tea as we had lunch buffet. What crap!!!
5
My wife and I enjoyed another great dinner this past Wednesday and are return customers, having eaten at Delhi Restaurant over the course of more than 15 years. What has always impressed us is the consistent high quality of the food. The colors of the interior of the restaurant make the atmosphere very warm and inviting. Service is good even when they are packed! Don't miss an order of their famous Mango Kulfi at the end of your meal. Out of this world

This review is for Delhi Restaurant located at Race Course Road. I got three coupons from FFF for Chicken Biryani at Delhi Restaurant. I went there with my dad and friend to the place. When we entered there we were ushered in politely and the manager at the front desk asked us what we wanted. We duly showed him our coupons and told him that we would like to redeem the Chicken Biryanis. The minute we said that, the manager's tone changed and he became extremely hostile. He rudely told us that he cannot permit us to use the coupons as they can be used as one coupon per table. We agreed to that and one of us ate first, while the rest of us went shopping to return later. We returned later and once again the manager in a rude, loud voice (now practically yelling at us) told us that we will have to sit separately. Again we agreed to it (it was just two of us at this point). Then the manager suddenly changed his statement and started humiliating us very loudly. He kept going on and on about how we are taking advantage of the offer and how Delhi Restaurant doesn't get any benefit from FFF's offers. At this point I got really angry, because we were being insulted for no reason. I mean just because we are using vouchers to pay for the food doesn't mean we have to be treated disrespectfully.There was absolutely no need for the manager to yell at us like that. I still stayed on to redeem my biryani because if he is making such a fuss about his precious food, then there must be something great about it, right? I waited half an hour for a bowl of COLD chicken biryani. There was absolutely nothing remarkable about it. Three tiny pieces of chicken, one soggy boiled egg, half plate full of rice and a tiny bowl of oily gravy. Out of curiosity I checked the price for this Biryani in the menu and it was listed as $12!!! Twelve dollars for this substandard, tiny portion of biryani?? I wouldn't have paid five dollars! On top of that was the extremely rude service by the manager and waiters. The waiter all but slammed the bowl of biryani on my table and left. I do NOT recommend this restaurant to anyone. We customers came today just to see what the restaurant was about. If we had been treated nicely and if the food was also good, we would have definitely come back next time to order more of their dishes. Too bad, their loss. They lost a customer. Pathetic staff, pathetic food
4
It's a Nice Indian Restraurant...the owner was very helpful in arranging a parking voucher coupoun, though they also have few restaurant parking (Parking being a being a big challenge in Singapore).On a nice cool morning we sat outside...It was morning around 10:00 am Little India had stated to get busy...shops were just opening with fragrance of incense stick waft through the air...It has Good north-India food and hospitable staff
4
We went here at around 10.30pm which was almost the closing time but they still took our order. I expected the food to be average as it was quite late but to my surprise it was delicious. The papads and green chutney were like icing on the cake and they even provided extra portions for no extra charge.Only the price could be made to suit a budget traveler
3
I am a local and have been coming to this restaurant for many years. The food used to be good and reasonably priced in the past. But today when we were here the food tasted nothing fantastic. Juz ordinary north indian food but the bill made our jaw drop. The prices has increased steeply. The price does no justice to the food quality. Simply put ... food that used to cost $40 like 2 to 3 yrs back has now gone up to $60. Don't think will return.
2
Tried this with my family over the weekend and was thoroughly disappointed. The supposed sizzler was nothing but mixed vegetables cooked indian style. The starters were dull and soggy, the roti was prepared probably a few hours back and was just re heated. The hot and sour soup was super bland. Overall a poor experience. There are much better indian restauraNTS on the same road. Mustard. Indian express etc.
4
The food tasted excellent. Easy to navigate menu on an iPad with photos and description of the items.
I'd recommend any of the sizzling dishes. The presentation with a large flame was pretty cool.
5
We had one of the best Indian meals we had out of India. The chicken tikka masala was brilliant, as well as all the other main and side dishes.
The service was warm and hospitable.
Warm recommendation for whenever you are in Singapore
5
They serve northern Indian cuisine. The restaurant is located in little India and you really have the feeling to be in India. High quality food, the chicken tikka is a must!!!!!! great service and acceptable prices.
5
This is the best North Indian Restaurant in Singapore. My parents had their wedding dinner here (this was 29 years ago) and till today, this is THE place we come to for Indian food, and we have celebrated almost every special occasion here! I visit Delhi at least once in two to three months, and have decided to finally write in! They have a Halal kitchen, with meat coming from a Halal supplier. It's just that they sell alcohol, which is why they are not certified. Unfortunately, no pictures today! Entertainment is in a form of a TV with the latest Bollywood songs being played. Service is of top-notch! :D But trust me, these are some of their best dishes: 1. Chicken Tikka2. Mix Grill Sizzler3. Keema4. CHEESE NAAN5. Kashmiri Naan 6. Dal TadkaAnd honestly, the list goes on....
4
This is a surprisingly good North Indian restaurant. Singapore is generally better known for its south Indian food and the north Indian fare can be a little underwhelming we know from experience. Having lived in Delhi myself I sometimes get a craving for a decent butter chicken massala, rumali roti or mattar paneer. If you decide to visit this restaurant we strongly suggest you stick with the usual, the most tested & chosen dishes such as dal makhani, palak paneer, butter chicken. Service is a little slow but the food was surprisingly good
5
Our little gem in Little India. Great flavours and very reasonable prices. Order on the ipad, plenty of choice across vegetable and meat options. Our 2nd trip back with overseas guests did not disappoint. We found 3 mains, 2 sides, 1 rice and a naan each did the trick. A fan in particular of the garlic naan! Looking forward to going back already..

I'll be candid about my review. Being an Indian I understand what an Indian taste & quality of food means. I'm not talking about very spicy or over rich food, but an Indian food with an authentic delectable taste which truly represents what Indian food is all about.I was finding a good restaurant to satiate my hunger pangs and I happen to come across Delhi restaurant, so called 'Indian restaurant'.I ordered Chicken jalfrezi and karela do pyaaza (bitter gourd) and to my amuse, it was just terrible. The food was just plain boiled & the other vegetables were undercooked or rather raw and both the dishes had 50% onions added to it. It more seemed to be like an onion preparation rather what I ordered. Moreover, the gravy used for both entries were bland and common.Simply said, a poor representation of Indian food and no mind was put into its preparation. They are ruining the name of great Indian food, pathetic taste ever had anywhere in Singapore. A frozen package food will taste better than the food served here.One word for this restaurant "IGNORE" it at all costs, otherwise you'll repent wasting your time & money at this place !
3
It's just another Indian restaurant. nothing special about it or anything that differentiates it from many other restaurants in the same area. menu is alright but taste is very much different from what an authentic north Indian dish is like. service is pretty poor and waiters behave as if they are doing a favor by serving you. I will avoid it next time
3
I went to delhi restaurant with my family and friends..but was really disappointed. Taste and quality of food is very average and some dishes are really not worth trying.The service is also quite poor with no proper management in taking order and serving the food.The restaurant definitely needs a make over/renovation, as the ambience and furniture look very dull and old....Poor ambience also makes you feel that the food is really bad.The rates are quite on the higher side, which make the visit even more disappointing
1
I went to Delhi Restaurant of Race course road on 01 Jan 2016 with my family and very much disappointed with the Quality of food and also their response on complain. After reaching there, we got table within 5-10 mins and We were served Papadam as a starter which was quite good - crispy and tasty. The hotel ambience is also nice and interior is also unique. Up To this point, we were happy on overall experience. But after ordering main course, we had a real bad experience. We wanted to have North Indian food and hence ordered 2 curries with Roti and paratha. It took 40 mins for them to prepare the food and when we received it, the breads (Roti and Paratha) were ice cold as they might have prepared it before preparing curries (normally breads are prepared last so that customer can get fresh and hot breads). When we asked them to change it, they used the same breads and tried to heat it again (though we have clearly informed waiter not to do so as it makes breads very hard). As expected, breads became so hard that it was impossible to eat specifically for my 3 years old kid. When we complained to waiter, he said that this is what we usually do. We left that place without completing the food.I would advise readers not to even try this restaurant.Thanks..
3
We ordered a dal, paneer and chapatti at the restaurant. Food was just about ok, service was slow. all in all - i think little india overall does not have really good restaurants.
couple of good ones are pind baluuchi and ras at boat quay.
5
Me and my girlfriend was here for dinner. Actually we were looking another Indian restaurant but we found this. Meals are good portions are big and enough price is very reasonable. So for any kind of enjoyable meal you can choice this.

good indian food available below of hotel broadway, just at two door step another hotel amber also available here, yes accepted card payment for food bills.

We were out in little India and after the being overwhelmed at the Mustfa centre we needed some food and a cold beer . We stumbled on the New Delhi on the main road , and as we were desperate for a beer ( finding booze can be difficult in this area for obvious reasons) so we gave it a go. I've eatern as I'm sure most UK people have many , many curries over the years and most are OK , this one was great , and I am now surprised as some of the mixed reviews on TA! Perhaps we were lucky but the food was exceptional, we opted for chicken tikka , samosas , pakora chill is and crispy chilli prawns with a few sides of takka dal and allo gobi . All of the food was excellent and washed down with a few ice cold kingfishers really hit the spot. You are spoilt for choice in Little India and I know there are better resturants just around the corner ( probably ) but I hope that you won't be disappointed if you went to New Delhi , we weren't......
2
Since my last visit, the Management of the restaurant changed hands n so also the chef. The food that we had for lunch on 23rd Dec was quite pathetic. Gobi manchurian was full of food color and it took few hand wash with soap to get rid of the stain. Not worth the visit. My personal view is better to avoi
3
Service is fast and efficient.Our North Indian butter chicken was good, but the Goan Fish Curry was not so tasty. We've had better butter naan.A couple of large groups made the place a little noisy.Overall , the food was ok at a reasonable pric
4
I came with my colleagues and bosses. It was nearby little India met station. The place is dark and cozy. We had reservations before coming but to our surprise there weren't any lunch crowd at all. We were the only ones there. Heard that this restaurant is packed in the evening only. So u don't have to worry about getting a seat there. My boss ordered the Ala carte buffet which was on promotion $15++/pax. We asked for plain water but it took so long just to get water for 8 of us. Some crackers was served 1st. It was tasty and crunchy. Waited for about 30mins and the dishes was served. Mostly chickens and fish cooked in different styles. Then naan(bread) was served abt 10mins later. And more dishes was served. In total roughly close to 10 dishes was served. And it all tastes great. It was soooo good and delicious. Authentic taste I must say. we had a good lunch and the food was more than we expected. I would give a 5 star only if the staff there we more proactive.
3
Dinner service was busy during visit that I was directed to the worst seat : stained table cloth, seat that could break at any moment and bird poop. However I was compensated with a nice view of the bustling district.Ordered vegetable jelfrezi, chicken tandoori and Kashmiri pulao.Vegetable Jelfrezi tasted authentic, the tandoori wasn't to dry and the Kashmiri pulao was a bit bland but not too bad. Water and papad is complimentary.Service was excellent although some of the staff had problem understanding English. They are friendly in general.Price was a bit too upscale and the portion for tandoori is small
3
In Singapore we were looking for Indian food and found Delhi Restaurant on race course road. we did ordered Kadhai paneer with naan and tandoori roti. food was having Indian flavor but not very close to Delhi north Indian flavor.Mr. Patel the manager was very nice to us and very helpful too. Service was good. Later we found prices are on higher side and size of serving is smaller compare to other Indian restaurant in the same area
2
Being travelling for couple of weeks and missing the home home food, We were all attracted by its name Delhi n more over It says Kashmiri Cuisine.. So we gave it a try, and to our surprise it's nothing like what it says..- No Authentic food ( forget Kashmiri cuisine they don't even serve a proper north indian food.)- shabby ambiance - poor service - above all worst unhygienic kitchen, I was surprised to see how dirty it was n moreover how the Singapore authority has issued a license for its operation.
5
This is one of the best Indian Restaurant with reasonable pricing. They have plenty to choose from so cater to each one from Non Spicy to Meat dishes and Vegetarians
5
Totally Punjabi Taste with all Indian spices. Non vegetarian can take food with tandoor options. Visit once.. you eill love the food. Little bit costly.
4
My first time to order thru an iPad which was brilliant. A quiet big menu to choose from, so it is safe to say they have something for everyone. Service was efficient and staff friendly.
We were very pleased with our food.
4
We came across this place after we visited the Night Safari. The food was great. The ambience was lacking though. The owner was always there to make sure we got our food on time and that it tasted well. Had a very good experience overall.
5
The whole family love the food at Delhi. I am not a fan of the iPad ordering, but it is convenient and quick. The sizzling platter of starters is just the best and the butter chicken and rogan josh are delightful. Actually, everything is delish.
3
Whilst strolling through Little India came across this restaurant offering a set menu lunch ..We decided it was worth a go and we both enjoyed it sitting outside watching the world go by and eating some good Indian cuisine. The Mauritius born waiter was an added bonus with his friendly chat, Enjoyed and would go agai
5
After a long day at Sentosa for Harry my sons birthday we decided to go back to Delhi restaurant where we had a cold beer a day or so ago and have a meal it turned out to be a great choice.One of the meals we had was the mixed seafood sizzle plate it smoked the whole restaurant out but it was worth it its a must try but try to get outside table.Thanks to all the staff for a great meal
3
Since, i was staying in the same hotel for 3 days, didn't have food here. But i did see the menu, it is reasonably priced. Somehow never saw it fully occupied, even on a Sunday, when the whole Little India is teaming with people.Food was a bit greasy and typical North Indian fare (tandori). There are many good options nearby. The open air restaurant and part of same hotel is cheaper and almost daily occupied. Try there instead
3
Went there for dinner on a Friday. Good interiors and ordering is via iPAD.Waiters struggle to describe dishes when we wanted to clarify but were very courteous.They served complimentary Poppadum with mint chutney which was later "Charged" to our bill. Small amount but not ethical.Veg Soup was ok and Paneer Shaslik was tasty though we can see lots of colour being used in preparing the dish.Main course was Roomali roti, plain rice and Dal tadka as we had heavy lunch. Taste wise ok and portion size good.Service is prompt and waiters are very polite. Not much complain, typical north indian style restaurant
4
Dropped in here during a visit to Little India - there are plenty of restuarant choices on Racecourse Road (and elsewhere of course) but the menu looked good, the restaurant was clean and there were plenty of smiles. We were not let down - food was good - pick traditional dishes and you won't be disappointed - try out the roti and different breads instead of the rice for a nice change - they are all freshly made on the premises. Food that we had was pretty authentic and well prepared. As others have already commented, I don't like the ipad they give you to order. As regular curry eaters we half filled the tablet and told the waiter what we wanted for the rest...and he obliged with a smile
3
We just happen to be there, not too reat family place. They call themself as indian resturant but have to learn lot about indian food and taste.high cost not recommendable. There are lot of other good places nearby just keep paitence to get good place
4
The food was good and the service too was satisfactory .We ordered Vegetarian dishes which were well prepared .
4
This is a great little restaurant in Racecourse Road in the Little India area of Singapore. You order from the eMenu on a tablet - a little unusual but the experience is fun. The food is excellent, we had the best samosas since... Goa in India. The level of spice and heat was perfect, we ordered too much but the flavours were so good we nearly managed to eat it all! Bollywood on the screen at the end and the umbrella-based lighting features add to the quirky ambience. All in all a thoroughly good evening, definitely recommended
4
Everything we had for dinner here was delicious. I would definitely go again rather than wait for the other longer wait restaurants on Race Course. The ipad ordering is nice but they also need traditional menus to make it easier on everyone at the table to read about and make selections. I saw some comments in reviews that food was too hot; I would have put the overall at 2/4 stars on typical spicy scales....no individual dishes really hit the 4/4 mark
1
I have never had a mixed grill where they chopped the meat into small pieces and slathered on tikka masala sauce. It wasn't a mixed grill. It was mixed meat in a store bought tikka masala sauce. Their biryani was clearly just rice mixed with briyani masala, It was ridiculous. If I could give it negative stars I would. This place frankly does not know how to cook .. leave alone spicy Indian food
4
I have never had a bad meal at Delhi and I have been going for 15 years!Certainly, the sizzling Tandoor platter is a winner, as too are the reliable butter chicken, rogan josh and dal makhani.I am not sure about the iPad ordering, but it is efficient. And the service is generally excellent.Whenever I have a need for some Indian food, Delhi is #1 on my list
4
My family like to come to this restaurant when we think of north indian food. Our favourites are the chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, (spinach) paneer and naan (garlic, butter or plain). We have also tried the dosai. My kids love the chicken kebab (can request for the non spicy version), which is grilled to perfection. Occasionally, having these with the masala tea or sweet lassi is a real enjoyment. The staff are rather friendly.This restaurant had been recommended to us by a friend couple more than 10 years ago and we have been patronising it time and again since then. It has not failed our expectation each time. This Broadway hotel restaurant had encountered a fire recently and is currently undergoing a facelift. Hope that it will be resuming its business with the same gusto very soon and we can get even more value for money meal here
4
we have a 2 year old kid. it is not easy to have food along with him as he needs our full atention.staff at the restaurant made sure that we enjoy the excellent dinner served by them by taking care of our son and taking him around while we had the sumptuous dinner.thanks all of you
2
We decided to try this restaurant for dinner, seeing a number of people seated inside, but turned out to be such a waste of time and money. The seating area is quite noisy, and very distracting with the servers just hanging around near the bar area. We ordered Aloo Tikki, Dal Makhani, Kadhai Paneer with Kulchas. After a long wait, we finally got our main course, at which point the server asked if we had gotten our appetizers yet! We hadn't but decided to go ahead with the main course anyways since we didn't want that becoming cold just lying around. We got our Aloo Tikki when we were midway through.About the food - the Dal makhani had an overdose of ginger, but was creamy and had potential otherwise. The paneer was soft but the gravy had a weird taste. The Aloo Tikki was nothing to write home about either. At the end when we got our bill, they had even charged us for the Papad, which they bought out even before we ordered and we assumed was complimentary. Very sneaky indeed.Overall, not someplace I'd be visiting again
1
I should have left when I was handed an iPad and waved to a seat in an empty restaurant by an unsmiling person. This is the hottest food I have eaten for a very long time and I regularly eat Indian food. Every single dish, except the rice, was exceptionally hot. Dishes that I have had many times, like Dahl Makhani and Saag (often chosen as a creamy counterpoint to a hot curry), were red hot too. Hours later my son told me while cleaning his teeth that his tongue was numb.The food was so hot we were only able to eat about half of it. We were obliged to order this meal by iPad with no further interaction with a person except to put the plates on the table. We were not offered a drink whilst selecting the menu, were not offered any more water during the incredibly hot meal and could not attract a serverâ€™s attention although even when we left there was only one other table with people in the restaurant and multiple staff. Our half full dishes were eventually taken away and we heard them being hurled into a sink as we waited a very long time for the iPad to sync with the till. After objecting to the undeclared 10% service charge when there had been no service, they did reduce the bill by this amount. Unfortunately, there were explosive repercussions from this meal later that night and the following day, spoiling our final day in Singapore and our final day of a two month trip overseas. Iâ€™m sure others will read this and assume we are not used to eating this kind of food, but we frequently eat different kinds of Indian food and had eaten all kinds of food during our trip. Of eight countries we traveled through, this was the worst meal and the worst service.There are literally thousands of excellent eating establishments in Singapore. This is not one of them
5
Inviting and intimate atmosphere, not as tourist orientated as some other restaurants near by. The food was AMAZING - The fish briyani was one of the best ones I have ever had. Service was attentive. We would definitely go back again.
2
Unduly expensive, terrible preparations and taste, unprofessional service, Noisy environment, Supposed to be a north Indian restaurent, serves Indian food but not really Indian preparation and taste.
Right at the bottom of the hotel Broadway
3
The food was delicious and reasonably priced. We ordered enough to feed an army, and it barely scraped $100. The food was a little hearty, though, so be prepared to be super full on a small amount! Portion sizes are to share.Ambiance was good, we came in when there was no crowd so it was pretty cold. Soon, people started coming in even though it was a Thursday. Service a little bit slow.You order your food via iPad, and it may take a little while to come in. Was a bit disappointed when we ordered the Kulfi and waited about 20 minutes to get it before making an enquiry, and lucky we did as they just managed to tell us they were out of it. Oh well! Maybe a little upgrade to the system would help.Overall not too bad a place
1
I was there for lunch with a out of town friend and the experience was so bad that I was feeling sorry to have brought my friend (first time visiter to Singapore) and wasted two hours of his time. Surprised to see a big board that says, nominated for 100 best restaurants in Singapore. I ask how? Food - no starAmbiance - 1 starService - no star (felt like the waiter were not even interested in serving) Price - like a star restaurant Please avoid or try it for yourself and you can add further to my REVIEW. Cheers

Dined here yesterday with my family. We ordered Tomato Soup ( To be shared), Masala Kulcha (Bread stuffed with cottage cheese and potatoes) Cheese naan, the signature Delhi butter chicken and rasa malai for desserts. The soup was little greasy and bit bland. The Masala kulcha and cheese naan were served hot but they were just ok. It would have made a huge difference if they had drizzled some butter on them. The signature butter chicken was presented well with cream and cashews. Subtly spiced, the chicken was well cooked and the serving was generous but it wasn't creamy and buttery as it supposed to be. The rasa malai was very plain. The milk reduction was not flavoured with cardamom, saffron or pistachios. Definitely not a restaurant quality dish. I was pretty surprised to know that the charged for the papadams they served. Its not a norm at all but I'm not complaining as the mint chutney was excellent and I would pay $2 just for that.The service was pretty good and ordering the food was pretty simple using the Ipad, fixed by the wall at each table. Waiters were polite and efficient. Food is very reasonably priced. Over all, its just an average restaurant BUT they can do better if they do some minor recipe tweaks

Nothing much to say about this restaurant. I will summarize in bullet points- Location - *** (Well located in city area, amongst a series of Indian restaurants)- Food - * (Leaves a bad stale taste in your mouth)- Staff & Service - ** (The only good part is that they let you place order through their iOS app, and keep a iPad at your table, which means you don't have to call a waiter every time you want to place a order, and it gives you a good view of your order along with total cost excluding taxes. Staff is untrained)- Ambience- ** (Cramped though some feel good factor with traditional handicrafts along walls and ceiling )Would I recommend this? Nope, there are series of better Indian restaurants on same street. Avoid this on

Went here with my family on my dad's recommendation because he had dined here with his friends back in the 90s. It was probably 3 PM and we were the only diners there and seated immediately.There's an immense selection of curries, breads, etc so you probably have to spend a good 10 minutes to really read through the menu! We finally came to a decision to opt for paneer pakoda, chicken tikka masala, lamb roganjosh and two kinds of naans. They were all great and more than enough to feed the four of us that we had to take some of the paneer home because we couldn't finish it!Good value for money. We were almost shocked when the bill came out because it wasn't as expensive as we had thought it'd be. A must-visit when you're in Singapore

Considering that i have been away from my local delicacies, for quite few days, though of trying the same, on the 1st day of our trip to Singapore. Order for Tandoori chicken which seemed still ok, considering its Singapore. The worst was yet to come. We ordered BHUNA GHOSHT, and what came was some small pieces of lamb cooked in burnt onion and a pathetic gravy. To all rest friends...for me it was far far away form North Indian

Found the restaurant by chance - just passed by when showing tourist around Little India. It has turned out to be our favourite North Indian in town. They have a great selection of Indian dishes; not very spicy, so our kids will find lots of things on the menu, too. The atmosphere is way beyond average for an Indian restaurant. All dishes we've tried out so far have just been absolutely delicious. Sizzlers are to be especially recommended. Palak Paneer was also great. Easy access from Little India MRT

We ordered Puthina Parantha and naan. Both had 4 small pieces. Then we ordered chicken tikka and dhal makani too. More than enough for 2 persons. Came around $30. Awesome taste and very little oil. Must try restaurant. Only drawback is the 10% Vat and 7% Gst, which some restaurants wont impose

IÂ´ve lived in Singapore for 4 years and each time IÂ´ve been to Delhi Restaurant,I got amazed by its service and price. Whenever IÂ´m in Singapore, I have to find some time to go there.
5
Went there for dinner, great food. Was so good went for breakfast, lovely Massala tea with dosa and dahl delicious.
5
The food is amazingly good. Freshly prepared. Excellent service and environment. One of the best places in Singapore to have Indian food.
4
Tasty food and they provide home delivery. Only wish they could give more onions/salad with food ;) Very nice on the whole.
5
Clean and well serviced staff! Delicious food and attentive staff. Will not go anywhere else for the same cuisine!

I have been going to Delhi for most of the 18 years I have lived in Singapore. I have never had a bad dish. Not once, not ever.I have seen some bad reviews. And it is true that having iPads does take away some of the service aspects, but it also reduces the possibility of wrong orders. And you get to see what you have ordered as you go, with kids able to order and you see the bill in real time.I just went for dinner with 4 adults and 4 kids with half being visitors. The meal was spot on the money. Sizzling platter, butter chicken, rogan josh, dal makhani and a few others as well as a load of roti.4 adults and 4 kids, $150. what a gift. Thanks Delhi, I can't wait to come back..

We wanted a good Indian meal, and being from Vancouver Canada, we're used to that. This restaurant was trying to be innovative with their ipad ordering system. And at first we thought it was kind of cool, until we noticed that it has simply sucked the soul out of the waiters. They don't get to interact with, or charm, their customers anymore: they are simply carriers of food. We think it is not a good innovation - drop it and go back to letting us have charming interactions with the staff! The food was okay but the lamb curry had huge muttony chunks that had not been simmered long enough to turn them into succulent morsels. The Tandoori chicken was good and the pekoras were okay but missing the tamarind sauce that makes them divine. The restaurant has more ambience than the food-zoo feeling of the Banana Leaf up the road, but it still leaves us missing India
4
Not sure if we were very hungry or their food is really good but we enjoyed having dinner here on 26 july 2014. Service & food taste was very good. It is not expensive and I would certainly go back in my next visit. Invoice attached for price reference.The only improvement I would suggest is to offer water to customers as they come. We had to ask for it.The one other thing I liked is ipad next to each table to see the menu
3
Scottish couple who live in Australia and love curries. Plus - courteous staff and fairly cheap. Neg- my lamb curry was eatable. My wife's chicken tikka masala tasted and looked like a cup of green chillies had been added. I love spice but could not even stand this. So bad should have sent back. Can only give restaurant 4 out of 10 as a result
4
Taken there by Indian friends from Delhi now residing in Singapore for real authentic cooking at 'Delhi restaurant' Just first class very clean authentic delhi cooking - and wow in the hustle and bustle of Little India we get IPAD menus and you do your own ordering! To throw a curveball, we asked if any possibility for GlutenFree (wife is coeliac) cooking considerations - and what we got was a refreshing change - No problem! - because in Singapore we had had mixed results. Great night out and terrific food. Butter chicken, tandoori chicken and daal were outstanding. Just need to ask for your white wine to be chilled otherwise it will come out warm
5
Both outlets (Race Course and 195c Serangoon Rd) serve fresh Indian food - just the right spice level. Wifey likes the Mango Lassi.

We were really hoping to get a good lunch after a hard days work. We were recommended by our friend. The food was very north Indian and delicious.

I'm American, my Husband and in-laws are Bengali, my in-laws live in Singapore. We ended up at Delhi Restaurant in search of some delicious Indian food to honor my late Father in-law. We were not disappointed. We had dahl makhani, chicken tikka, chicken tandoor, fish tikka, chicken mirchi, garlic naan, lacchi parantha, malai kulfi, and ras malai. We also enjoyed a nice bottle of Australian Chardonnay. Everything was delicious, we all thoroughly enjoyed our meal. It was exactly what we were looking for, Good, Spicy, Comfort Food.They also have an ipad at the table that is used to look at the menu and order food. We had fun taking pictures while we waited. We left them so the next diners could see who was there. That was the first time I'd used an ipad to order my food. Pretty cool

After shopping till we almost dropped in china town and little india, we needed a rest and some food. The naan bread was just too good! The butter chicken was shared between us and was authentic. The prices were good and the airconditioning was a life saver.There were lots of foreigners and locals dining here. The best part was that they served icy cold beer!I definitely recommend this restaurant

Among the list of restaurants that are lined up in Little India - chose this restaurant randomly and it was a good choice. Good food ! Curries had good taste. Tried both Plain Naan and Keema Stuffed Naan for breads and a chicken gravy ( I think it was Pepper chicken). Nice flavour and color - had a good meal
4
I first visited this restaurant three years ago, picking a restaurant at random in Little India for a curry. Returned with my family three years later!The outside terrace seating is great for watching Little India bustling by.The food is really good, and it's huge portions (especially by UK standards). Samosa's were gorgeous.A few caveats: it gets quite busy so they can subtly encourage you to leave if they need the table; the toilets are a bit ropey; and the the spiciness doesn't correlate with UK settings: for example, the mildest curry we had was my vindaloo, and the spiciest was my eldest daughter's mixed grill

We first discovered the Delhi restaurant five years ago, on our first trip to Singapore.It is about 2 blocks down Serangoon Rd on the opposite side to the ubiquitous and often infuriatingly labyrinthine Mustafa Centre.We love Indian food and have never had a bad meal at the Delhi. The onion Baha'is are particularly tasty!After multiple visits on our first trip, we made a beeline there on day two of our trip in May 2013, finally wading into the restaurant through a calf length 'moat' in the afternoon torrential downpour. Wel worth it. We returned 2 days later with my brier and his wife and all enjoyed the feast.Good honest tucker. The meal we had at Clarke Quay was in much more salubrious surroundings, cost a lot more and wasn't as tasty. Just enjoy the down to earth atmosphere of Little India, a welcome antidote to the glass and concrete canyons on Orchard Rd

I should have read the reviews here before going to the restaurant. Priced seemed to be fair (about 30$ for a starter, main with rice and a beverage) and there were some local indians inside, which looked like a good indicator.The malaysian looking woman at the front desk was VERY unfriendly when I asked for a table and she put me somewhere in a corner, since I was dining alone. Had to wait quite some time until the food arrived, which was semi-warm/cold and NOT fresh (except for the gravy).I had to ask twice for the bill and wait another 20-30 minutes until the fine woman from the front-desk handed me the bill without a comment.Save your time & money and visit one of the many restaurants nearby.Cheer

IT is conveniently located in Little India and out door seating is available. Good Food, Open till late night, Good Food and

Situated in the hearty of Little India this restaurant offers fast and efficient service and really tasty Indian food at very reasonable prices - highly recommended.
5
It's a very good restaurant, where you eat good Indian food. The service is good too. And the prices are not too expensive.
4
Have tried several Indian restaurant in Singapore and Delhi restaurant is one of the good ones. We have dined at both their outlets but prefer the one on Race Course Road.
Though their service aspect is lacking from before but the food is good.

A very good north indian hotel at little india. The service and quality of food is very good but somehow a bit costlier.
1
Well me and my friend Ordered a Simple cottage cheese gravy and a black dal, at first when our order came the food looked decent (not how we expected it to be of course) even the garlic naan was tasteless without butter! at the end of it when we washed our hands and noticed that the colours of the gravy just wouldn't go.. the food was adulterated and tasteless not worth the price at all!! So stay away from this place to be healthy and happy
1
Well the name suggests that you should get authentic north Indian food, honestly pathetic is less to describe the food here. We literally left the place after we got what we ordered as it was really bad & we again ended up going to The Banana leaf which is few steps away. Stay away from this eatery.
5
Though it's a small restaurant, it offers excellent and authentic North Indian cuisine. Love the Garlic Naan, fragrant yellow rice, mixed vegetable kurma, Malar chicken kebab...and not missing out the mango kofe which is the Indian creamy ice-cream! The food is not so spicy and the prices are good for that quality. The staff is attentive, depending on the time you visit the restaurant. We always go there for special occasions

Delhi Restaurant is in a very convenient part of Little India, and we walked in because there seemed to be a lot of Indians eating there rather than Singaporeans. The food was very good, the entree sizes were larger than we expected and consequently we ended up ordering too much food. The mains were very good and no one had any complaints about the food. But the staff were GRUMPY! Everything was too much trouble.....when we asked for serving cutlery for the entrees, the response was a grunt. When we explained that one of our party had ordered bubbly mineral water and not a bottle of iced water....grunt! When one of the mains arrived wrong, even though the woman had read our order back to us....no apology and just a grunt. Would we go back? Possibly not! The food was very good but the attitude of the staff made it all too hard

Friends who had lived in Singapore recommended Delhi as a good place to try authentic fare in Little India. We were not disappointed. The food was delicious, with various levels of spice to satisfy Western palates. Chicken tikka and the lentil dishes were fabulous. Humble setting, but very attentive service, and portion sizes were just right. One cautionary note--toilets are authentic, too (hole in the floor). If that's a problem for you, don't drink too much beer
3
We had breakfast there - chola bhatura. The tea turned out to be a little pricey. The bhatura was good but chola...not so much. Good enough for breakfast.
5
Handy to Broadway Hotel, nice staff, good food and has won a million awards for healthy food. Always busy at nights with locals too.

good food brill

Located in Little India, this eatery has all the standard north indian dishes one would expect from a restaurant names Delhi. Food was decent and serving sizes were normal. Spice level was quite moderate (at least for my Indian palate). Pricing is OK for Singapore standards
5
My hubby and myself were recommended by GRAB Free Vouchers Now to dine at Delhi restaurant @Race Course Road. The decision to dine at this restaurant is one of the wisest decision we have made!The signature dish - The Mixed Grill is awesome and service is excellent. The staff make us feel welcomed and we have an enjoyable dining experience.I would not hesitate to recommend your restaurant to all my friends who wish to savor authentic Indian food.Keep up the good work

I have been addicted to the other branch located on 195 serangoon street.I have been there so many times and now I am completly selective on indian food and dishes... it has to be the top, otherwise it doesnt worth it. This restaurant offers me for years the simple layout and the great food i was looking for in little india! and, it is damn cheap

The first mistake we did was to try breakfast in Delhi Restaurant on out first morning in Singapore. Since we were staying in the Broadway Hotel which is where the Delhi Restaurant is also lodged we wanted to give it a go on the first day. And that too was the last time we entered that restaurant during our week long stay in Singapore. We had ordered a very simple breakfast but the food was not upto the standard; neither in taste, nor in portion and not at all in price. We chose to sit out in the open air, but the table cloth was stained and there were disturbing flies as the food arrived.There is no dearth of Indian restaurants in Little India; so itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better to walk down a few paces either along the Race Course road or Serangoon road and you will get decent places to eat

Though the food is ok , the service is very bad and to top it all we noticed incorrect billing for many customers including ours. There are two branches of this restaurant in little India area. The experience is of the one located at Race course road.This was during our recent visit to Singapore. We went to Delhi restaurant at Race course road, on 26th Oct,2011, as friends wanted to eat Indian food. We entered the place around 8:45 pm for dinner. It was more than 10 minutes before someone attended us for a seat. The place was less than half full at that time. We ordered standard Indian fare. We waited almost one hour before partial food was served and it took another hour for them to serve the rest. we got the vegetable dish but was waiting for the bread for another hour. Despite repeated requests, we were not able to get the food before 10:00. pm. Since most of the eating places closes in that area around 9:30 or so we were reluctant to move out. The guys including the lady on the counter was least bothered about this. We saw similar experience at other tables also.We noticed at least three customers arguing for the incorrect billing during this period and hence we checked our bill also very carefully. There were few items which we didn't ordered yet billed. This was rectified , once pointed out. The attitude of the staff and the counter lady and the owner lady (i guess) siting next to the counter lady , was " we have not invited any of you."Most of the customers were tourists like us and would like to forget this as bad dinner and avoidable place

We ate here on the second night of the Diwali Festival when it was extremely busy. We were sat quite quickly in a relatively small but perfectly adequate restaurant and brought pewter cups of ice water. The beer we were served was warm which was about the only disappointment but a result of the many people passing through and the small refrigeration space they had available. The meal that followed was excellent, not too spicy but far from mild and the service, given the day we were there, was attentive and efficient. We had eaten the previous evening at Clarke Quay and the bill at "Delhi" was less than half the price and the food, twice as good
2
The name is a great misnomer. The food served is no way North Indian or Delhi food. its rather expensive for the lousy stuff that is served in the name of North Indian food. There are several authentic North Indian restaurants on Serangoon Road a few meters towards Mustafa. Never go here for North Indian food. You will curse yourself for choosing to go there
