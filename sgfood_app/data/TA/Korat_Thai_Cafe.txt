I just returned to singapore after a week in thailand still, korat is better! Cashew chicken, best on planet. Penang seafood, even better. Love this place! Will probably be back tomorrow for last meal before returning to states. Back in October for sure! Try it!

The food is great but service is probably one of the worst I have seen in the industry. It's fairly reasonably priced but be prepared to wait and have terrible attitude.

This small place in Islington does fresh Thai food, the waiting staff was very friendly and service was good however it takes a long time for your starters and main meal to arrive however the taste is fresh and really good mango sticky rice dessert to

Be aware, this place doesn't look like a restaurant but rather a shack. It's located inside Orchard towers, in which you see all kinds of 'weird' people walk by at night because of the dance pubs that are open for teenagers until 10pm or so. Anyway, the seating area of this restaurant is in the corridor of the mall and they may just set up a foldable metal table and worn out plastic chair as you're looking for a place to sit. Service is minimal; 3 guys were serving food and they looked as if they were 70 years old or more. Anyway, the food was decent (there aren't that many thai restaurants in Singapore) and expect to pay around 20 dollars for a thai iced tea, an appetizer and a main dish, so it's quite cheap.I wouldn't call this place a restaurant but rather a thai fast food joint in a desolate commercial and C-rated mall building. You probably would not want to walk around in there unless you're really craving thai food

The food was great and reasonably priced. 5 of us ordered a total of 10 different delicious dishes.Had a chat with the owner, Raymond, and realised that they select their ingredients daily from the market to ensure that the consistency of freshness is never compromised.Be prepared to queue if you want to try out this amazing eatery

Korat. Located at one of the most "happening" buildings in Sg - Orchard Towers. It's only opens at 7pm until 3/4am. Wow! The food is really awesome n reasonably priced. I wouldn't mind the environment just for the food. Some people are not comfortable with the crowd there. But it's a pity if u miss the food simply because you can't accept others. Go with an open mind. But do take note that this place isn't really children friendly. I don't recall seeing any high hairs around. The crowd moves pretty fast. Pple eat n leave n seldom hang around. We love the raw shrimp salad. It's so fresh that we couldn't resist the temptation of ordering another round of it. There is a fried fish that u must try as well. The dish's name ends with "nam tok" can't recall the full name. It will be good to go in at least a group of four so as to be able to try a few dishes at least. Be prepared for long Q. The last we went, we sat outside at 6.45! N the service staff ain't very friendly. So don't have too high expectations. Just focus on the food!

2 of us shared a Tom Yum Seafood Soup, a stir-fry basil beef, and a stir-fry mixed vegetable. Food was excellent and came really quickly. Hidden in a corner of the sleazy Orchard Towers, I can only imagine people visiting either because of recommendations, or being a patron of the many massage parlours and bars there. Certainly not a child-friendly environment. Don't expect great, friendly service. Staff are strict about where you sit, and don't even try re-arranging their tables or joining tables to cater for larger groups. Best to ask

We decided on Korat upon my friend's recommendation, when he heard that we are planning on Jane Thai. We ordered green curry, minced chicken, mango salad, fish skin. Realized that they do not serve pork which is such a pity. Overall food was good but short on being outstanding. Not planning a return trip anytime soon.

So, i've been to Orchard Towers before, but never realized this place existed. I found it through Tripadvisor and I was skeptical. But, I tried it out today. WOW - extremely delicious! I have to agree with the previous reviewer that this is the tastiest Thai food I have had in Singapore to date. Of course, seeing lady boys coming and going, plus a ladyboy beauty shop next to the eating area is not for everyone. However, if you are tolerate to Orchard Towers, then you will LOVE this place

Noodles on pad see ew were overlooked. Papaya salad was excellent. Overall good for the price and open late. Note: the location is in a somewhat seedy area.

Awesome ! Good solid character about this place, I eat here regularly! Good night week dining and plenty of happy people

Had their basil pork with egg. Full of zest and the basil pork is done so nicely it gives an after taste that i yearn to go back..

Whilst the destination building, Orchard Towers, may not be to everyone's taste (the nickname 4 Floors of Whores will give you an indication) - this little gem of a cafe serves up some excellent dinnertime-to-latenight grub at v affordable pricesBetween 6 people - we had 2 types of curry, pad thai, pad see yew, basil chicken, tom yum soup obligatory thai ice tea/coffee and more...!!Set behind the back door of Romeos - one also has ringside seats of the local ladyboys walking in and out....Dinner and entertainment for a bargain price

Located inside the INTERESTING Orchard Tower, you can get yummy and affordable thai food till late ( 3am) Ambience is lacking, but doesnt really matter, not an area for kids, but if you want something thai and not those chain restaurants, this is the place to go

A friend took me here after knowing that I was craving for Thai food. Despite of the location, she ensured me that they have awesome fried pork, tomyum & omelette. The first mouth feed of the tomyum could tell everything. I love them all...it's relatively cheap compared to other high brand Thai food restaurants. Surely will come back :

My family own a Thai establishment so I was very sceptical at trying this food, however, the food was fantastic! So much so I had to write a review.My brother took me here to try the food, when visiting. I was a bit nervous at first as the location of the place is on the 4th floor of Orchard Towers.... This place is very busy at night, as you can imagine. There were lots of people to watch going by, if you are nosey like me! I ordered the Basil rice with chicken and the dried garlic beef. The food was equal to my family's gold awarded restaurant on the Isle of Man! It was fantastic and soooooo cheap!!! I am very annoyed that I came here towards the end of my holiday as I would have definitely came back. I love it so much I even ordered a take away!Highly recommended, it's a shame that it is in the location that it is. However, they probably get a load of business this way, which is fine by me

It must come with high reputation for this small cafe located on the third level of sleazy Orchard Towers to be rated the best Thai cuisine place in Singapore. Now to think on it again, it truly is.Without a doubt it's not the best ambience, right behind and next to some Thai discos, which may get a little noisy deeper into the night, and some dirty looking massage parlor- I personally feel it sets a kinda perfect resemblance to what Thailand is like (neglecting it's rich culture, arts, scenery and people).The food is authentic and tastes way better, and cheaper and bigger portion, as compared to other Thai food places such as Thai Express.I'll usually order the (sorry for the spelling mistake if any) Panang curry with chicken, garlic beef, Chuchi prawns, chicken omelette, stir fried kangkong (which is nice but not like the Malay kind of style). They're all absolutely amazing.Those are the fixed dishes that I'll always order. No fail.I've tried the raw prawns before. It's extremely spicy! Good for you if you can take it.I've heard the Thai milk tea is really good too.The waiting time isn't long. But the place can get really crowded with queues at dinner time. It's only open from 7pm onwards till late. Staff are friendly and I give this place three thumbs up if I've one more to spare.

When the omelette lands on the table, there'll invariably be comments about how oily it is... and it'll ALWAYS be finished (I usually order the plain one).The usual suspects: pad thai, tom yum, chicken curry - are all consistently delicious. Love their raw prawns too.One of The Go-To places for Thai food in Singapore

This is the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to. I haven't been to Thailand yet so this may change in the future. Ten of us squeezed together to share in the numerous dishes we ordered. Everything was simply divine.The restaurant is situated in a rather interesting area with a lot of scantily clad ladies of the night. Ignore the ladies and head for the restaurant. It's well worth a visit
