Place is nice to be fair. However prices of food is way over price. Burger for 27 bucks with some portion of fries. Truffle fries are not made with truffles at all. Replaced by cheese stripes instead. Service is close to zero.

I love the ambience especially outside seating. Relaxing place in the busy city. But quite crowded on weekends.
3
Very nice location and people are very Help fil . Unfortunately the food is really below average and rathet expansive.

Caught with my boy since he just got back from his hols. He enjoyed his pasta and his must have pecan pie! Nice set up! Will dine here again whenever in the vicinity

I visited PS Cafe in cool place in Dempsey Hill. It is very nicely located in the down hill side of the Dempsey Hill complex. So green and cozy environment for hang out with family and friends.The food is ok and lots of variety of drinks . It is friendly for kids as well as they can play and running on the green grass surrounding the restaurant. PS Cafe has opened the new concept still with green concept but inside the building which is Raffles City. It looks like a green house with amazing vertical garden inside.It is recommended to chill out with your friends n famil

A wonderful place for a pre christmas dinner. We were seated outdoors with a beautiful christmas tree view one way and the gardens the other. A very chilled atmosphere with beautiful design and relaxed coolness. I think the indoors are nicer, but in the evening the darkness becomes part of the setting and outdoor scene. We had three or four different waiters, which was a bit confusing for us to order and get started. Once the food was delivered it was very tasty and nicely presented. We opted in for the chrisms special dishes and we were pleased with our choices. Our pairing drinks were less perfect, as we had some cocktails and some wine. The staff was so little attentive that we actually ended up drinking little compared with what we would have if the waiters had been able to swing by our table a bit more often. One negative thing was that they started to remove every table around us, which made it into a "we are closing soon" experience. I think this was not the intention, so perhaps for future to offer a table where its not going to be cleared immediately while its still open and people enjoying. Overall a very good experience. Think this place is best for relaxed lunch or dinner, with good friends or couples

There are a few P.S Cafe in Singapore and I have visited outlets at Paragon & Raffles City.Raffles City’s outlet dinner dining experience was limited to 1hr 15mins despite I had a reservation made for my family of 5. Spend 10mins going through the menu before ordering which took another 5mins. The first dish was delivered 15 mins after the ordering (within acceptable waiting). The last dish was delivered 20mins before the allocated timing ends... The whole dinner was too rushing and can’t help to feel uncomfortable for me and my family. I would like to urge the cafe to be more realistic in the timing allocation as I find it unnecessary!! At the end of my dinner there are still quite a few empty tables. Really make the diners feel uncomfortable.Luckily we had enjoyed the food despite the experience. I would recommend the Tom yum salad, fried sweet potato sticks, truffles fries, seafood pasta.

I recently dined at the PS Cafe for dinner. The Decor was very chilled and relaxing and made you feel at ease. The starter was a bread and dip combination which was a decent enough standard for what it is, there isn't and shouldn't be any major starters to what it is. 4/5. For main I had LuLu's leftover lasagna which was quite flavoursome, the sauce and seasoning was very nice and rich. A lot of the dish stood out for me in a good way with certain taste's being not to my taste. A good dish overall 4/5. I was impressed with PS Cafe, It is somewhere to put on the list of places to eat in Singapore
3
I seem to be in a minority of always having sub-par experiences at PSCafe in Dempsey. Have always had better experiences at Ann Siang Hill.Service was smooth but not really responsive to feedback. The Tomato soup was extremely acidic in taste with little seasoning. They seem to have forgotten to add truffle oil to the truffle fries. The chicken parmigiana, though, was good.
5
Face it Singapore is one of the best foodie empires in Asia; so if I say that this is one of the best cafe or Restaurents in Singapore then that is a big recommendation. If I could give 6 stars I would.They have a modern varied cuisine. They are not just one cuisine but a taste of many. I’m always impressed by the menu and the care taken in picking from the regions culinary options.One of the reasons I’d give them an extra star is their desserts. They have cake upon cake lining the bench that you walk past. It is so rare to see a cafe or Restaurent go to such lengths that it is very impressive when they do. No slouching on desserts here!The fit out of this grand house is also memorable, particularly as you look out across the adjoining Ang Sian hill
4
Not so Fast food restaurant with western type food like fish and chips, meat burgers , pumpkin soup, juicy wagyu steaks,alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks , cappuccino as well. Grilled fish dishes are good .
4
We went there for a brunch.
The food is tasty, well served. Service is professional.
The surrounding are lovely.
Prices are on the higher end but overall good experience.
5
Just a pretty place to stop in Raffles City. Everything was perfect from the excellent service to the superb food, would head for it next time in Singapore.
4
We only came for drinks and cakes but the chocolate cake was HUGE! Very moist and delicious but you should share it, especially if you've just had lunch! The setting is lovely here, right in the forest but also in a good location not far out of the main city with lots of other good places to eat nearby. I would have liked to come back and try the rest of the menu but they were fully booked
4
Have eaten several times at The Dempsey branch of PSC, always so busy but good. We went today, there was a queue at lunch time, but it was well managed, food was good but expensive. However two things bothered me, firstly the noise, it was difficult to hear across the table. Also while waiting to use the washroom (only 1 available), a lady with a small baby was looking for a baby changing area. There is none....not great in a restaurant of this size
4
Recommended by family , we were taken there for dinner . As soon as we walked in the different desert cakes displayed already wanted us to get dinner over with. The meals are a good size and had excellent choices even for a vegetarian. But again it was the desert that was so rich In taste that one order is too much for even 2 people after a full delicious meal. The staff are friendly, efficient and organized. The entire meal was served to our group on time.
5
The service is really great with the staff all friendly with great smiles. The manager, Jeffrey, in particular took pains to make sure customers were comfortable and well looked after. Ambience is excellent as well, perfect for a leisurely weekend brunch. Not the cheapest place in town but you do get a great experience.First time trying the poached chicken and charred broccoli which was a delightfully healthy dish with generous servings of chicken breast pieces that were tender and not dry. The charred broccoli was a really nice touch to the dish and well complemented by the almond slices.The rib eye steak was nice as well. The rossa chicken penne is a great choice for the kids.For desserts, everything looks good but a personal all-time favourite is the mango banana crumble that has been a mainstay on the menu since the beginning. Enjoyed the flourless orange cake as well.Will be back to try the famed kaya toast here which is only available on weekdays
5
- Great ambient 10 min away from downtown and making you feel not even in Singapore. If itâ€™s not raining, eating in one of the outside tables is really something you cannot miss.- Food-wise, all dishes were absolutely delicious. A mix of different tastes that left everyone extremely satisfied.- Service-wise, waiters are really kind and professional. All dishes brought at the same time and they pay a lot of attention to customer needs(For being in Singapore...) good value for money.DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED
4
+ great location, interior, garden+ interesting menu+ good service+ excellent espresso+ complimentary iced water+ some meals (desserts) as very large portions that can be shared+++ bartenders who gave me milk for the baby bottle for free - thank you so much! Nice gesture!- my meal was soaked in oil (trout with soba, would never excpect that) with microscopic sizes of other sides mentioned on the menu- when I mentioned this to waiters, they seemed to be concerned and said that will mention this to chef - nothing happened afterwards- expensive for what you get, so not really good value for mone

My family and I (5 people) decided to have lunch at PS Cafe. Unfortunately we were not aware that during the week reservations were accepted and we had to wait 1 hour for a table, which turned out 35 minutes. We were seated outside on the terrace at a table of 4 with an additional seat; a bit cramped. We ordered two portions of PS truffle shoestring fries to share and portobello mushroom soup as a starter accompanied by a bottle of Albarino white wine. The fries are amazing as well as the soup. The main dishes were 2 steaks frites, a PS hamburger, a PS house salad (delicious dressing) and a spicy king prawn aglio olio pasta. All dishes were characterised as delicious. To top of this lunch we ordered a roasted rocky road, salted caramel profiteroles, a carrot cake and espresso. After the entrees we had to flee inside due to heavy rain. The staff was attentive and professional. All in all a very tasty and pleasant lunch in a garden setup
4
We decided to treat ourselves and grab brunch at PS Cafe before we went to the botanical gardens. The food was great, but it was really the venue that made it wonderful.
4
Aside from serving good coffee, this trendy spot serves yummy pastries, pasta and sandwiches. A favorite is the truffle fries.
4
There's little reason to revisit this or any outlet of PS Cafe other than for the ambience. Prices far outweigh the quality of food served, and service, while decent, is nothing to shout about.
4
Cosy, relaxed and friendly staff and good sensible eating. perfect for a sunday brunch. good choice of seafood and hamburgers and salads but surprisingly for me the "pièce de résistance", was not the food but the Bloody Mary!A regular bloody drinker I relish a well made Mary. just the correct dash of sauce, lime and salt. Vodka diluted with not too sweet tomato juice.Food was good and supplemented the drink. ordered one laksa (good sea food soup) stacked with sea food and noodles a bit large.but could not finish it...but had three bloody marys
2
Was here for lunch and had the $54 PS ribeye steak and Tiger beer battered fish and chips - both of which sounded exciting. However, food wasn't worth the price. Worth going here once just to experience the ambience. Just grab a coffee and fries will do!
5
No visit is complete without Truffle Fries. I have eaten here on many occasions with family & friends. The staff are friendly & service is good most of the time. Food is always good, the wine list is selective & some outlets only serve limited spirits.
4
New found love for gin! This restaurant has an extensive gin list and service crew was able to give good recommendations. We tried different types of gin and Monkey 47 is a hot favourite. The food is good as well but none stood out as exceptional.
2
I have visited PS Cafe quite some times, but all the time is eating in. This is the first time I would order take away. I order bread with dipping sauces which usually should come with 3dips. This time, for some reason, they mamaged to give me only bread in take away set. Wonder if they forgot all dipping sauces in the kitchen? disappointed since I paid almost sgd20 for just a bread
3
Have always been wanting to try out this cafe. But it was so disappointing. Only the truffle fries were good, but anything with truffle are good. Ambience was good too, because it was so rustic and near to nature since the restaurant was surrounded by trees and all. We had the following:Lychee and lime crushed fruit soda - just a normal soda with infused fruits, nothing worth noting of, green goodness pesto penne - had better pasta elsewhere, for those who likes a heavy pesto taste, just skip this dish because the taste of pesto is rather light. spicy king prawn aglio olio - this was not bad, but still i had better elsewhere. portobello brunch souffle - i really expected much more for a souffle, but it tasted just like a flimsy dutch pancake with mushrooms. crab tart - full of crabmeat, but there was a very herbal note to it that i couldn't point out. that herbal note lessened my liking for the dish. sticky date pudding - heard the rave about this online, but it was so bad. the disgruntled chef did it way better and will still be one of my favourite. double chocolate blackout cake - rich, extremely rich to a point that it becomes "jelard". even with the vanilla ice cream, you get sick of it very soon. this was shared among 4 diners and we still couldn't finish half the cake.
3
I visited here with a group of people. I had one of the salads with salmon. It was average (the salmon was almost raw and did not smell that fresh). Overall the menu was pricey, the burgers were good, but otherwise there was nothing too notable with regard to the food
1
Nice location but the service is absolutely not at the level. A line forming whole tables are empty inside. 20 minutes to be seated, 20 minutes to make an order ...after being solicited..
Very disappointed
3
The atmosphere at P.S. Cafe is nice and staff is friendly, when they come to the table. Food is ok, but rather pricey for what is delivered.
4
First and foremost, make sure you know that this location doesn’t have pizza. Only a few PS locations do apparently, something my crew didn’t know. Other than that food was good, pricey.
5
The food is great, but the understanding of Singapore from this part of town is better. PS Cafe has a bar upstairs where you can drink and view the original part of town
4
Fast food restaurant with western type food like fish and chips, meat burgers , alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks , good cappuccino as well. Grilled fish dishes are good too.
3
I've been to PS Cafe in Dempsey a few times. I'm new to Singapore so it's highly recommended by expats when you arrive. It's a great space, set in a garden in leafy Dempsey. I think I've been 4 times but haven't been for a while. The food is very modern , lots of healthy options. All come at a bit of a price. If you are visiting it's nice just to get a different perspective of the city. PS Cafe is a chain and they are spread around the city and my experience at Martin Place and also the Paragon is difference, service is usually on point but the location isn't as open and lush as Dempseys location.
4
Situated at the heart of Dempsey hills with lushes of trees surrounded this restaurant. Food variety is fusion and you can find choices of cuisine with Asia and western mix. The food quality is great, too much quantity in my view and Father expensive. Wine selection is limited and also expensive to drink a house pour wine at $20. Nice ambience for sure and attentive service.
4
Although the wines are crazily expensive I suppose drinking less would manage that but the ambience, location and great food balanced my view of the place. Busy but table allocation was professionally managed. Place for everyone from families with small kids to cook kids who were hanging out drinking coffee
1
We went there for a Sunday morning brunch because the place is pleasant.At arrival, the waitress announced 20 minutes waiting time. After 40 standing, I went to ask, and we were allowed to seat at a table which had been available all along. We order the classic breakfast. If you like greasy sausages, overcooked dry eggs and mushy bacon, and are prepared to pay 40$ per person, this is a perfect place
4
We were there for coffee and dessert. We ordered the double chocolate blackout cake and it was huge. The cake was a tad dry but there was more than enough for the 3 of us! We asked to be seated outdoors and it was great to be surrounded by greenery. The cool evening breeze added to the beautiful experience
5
With a new outlet at raffles city, P.S. Cafe is a great place to chill with family and/or friends. Cuisine is mostly western. Personally I like their truffle fries, fish and chips and sticky date pudding.
4
pretty pricey but food standard was good enough for me. the ambiance was pretty good. overall i would come back again if im around the area.
4
Rustic feel, food was good and service was excellent. However, price is not cheap as well. Overall, an excellent experience.
5
The food, the service, the atmosphere, the selection, was just what a traveler needs for lunch. I had expected the price to be outrageous, just because of the beautiful setting, but for quantity and quality it was a justifiable indulgence.
5
Very accomodating... we waited a while but Shereen found us a table outside on the relax area whilst we waited.
Food was brilliant.
Staff very attentive.
Shereen was so accomodating kind considerate. We will defo be back. It was worth the wait.
😁
2
Food was great, so compliments to the chef however the poor service led to a frustrating night chasing waitstaff. Once they got to our table the staff were polite and courteous but we had to get their attention multiple times for menu, drinks, more drinks. For a restaurant with this much experience, you expect a better overall experience.
4
The location is at the newly opened 3rd floor atrium of Raffles City. It was lunch time and the place is not entirely full. The price tag on the menu gives the reason: most of the dishes are $25 to $35. The quality of the food is quiet decent but for lunch I would still think twice about it
2
On the plus side, food is quite good....but you certainly pay for it and once the + + is added in (even before in many cases), I really do not see the value. Staff is very poor, and really dont seem to care, or quite understand how to wait tables properly, for which I fault poor management. Very loud inside, outside somewhat quieter. Been there a few times during my time in Singapore, but not more. Too many other options offering (1) more reasonably price fare (2) that is just as good (3) with a staff that actually gets it and (4) where I can have a conversation. Not PSC.
5
Had our annual Xmas lunch at PS Cafe, a place that is far away from the norm of our usual hangouts. The cafe is decorated tastefully, with 2 huge Christmas trees that really brings out the X'mas mood in us. There are 3 of us, and we ordered 2 soups, 3 mains and a dessert, along with some bubbles. We had Portobello Mushroom soup and their Xmas menu, Sweet Corn and Crabmeat Soup. They came thick and fragrant, and goes very well with the bread. Mains ordered includes a Roast Chicken and Seabream from their Xmas menu, and Lamb Chop. The portions were generous and tastefully plated. Dessert was a Chocolate Nut Doorstop with Vanilla Ice Cream. I must say that the ambience and food was really great, and fantastic for gatherings! One of my best Xmas Lunch with my girls
5
The food here is really really good!!! I enjoyed their truffle fries - you can smell the truffle first before it's place on the table. Also a generous serving and in think it's really fluffy cheese on top The miso cod is amazing!!! That is my Favourite! Their special item, beef tenderloin with forie gras - another great dish! We had dessert but in my humble opinion, their dessert is on the (very) sweet side, but huge portion! If you like very sweet dessert and big serving - go for it!Staff were attentive and provided prompt serviceI'm looking for another opportunity to return again!
5
Fab service and great healthy options. I ordered crudities which was a huge portion and my friend had soup and sandwich. All delicious. Jugs of tap water was infused with orange and mint
4
Charming environment, amongst the gardens and trees. Much like in a botanic garden. Food is great. Background music a bit loud though.
5
After a meal at Jumbo we picked dessert from PS Cafe, a slice of carrot cake and one of chocolate cake with vanilla sauce. Both were delicious. The portions are generous so do order accordingly.
4
While waiting can chill on the green area..food are average..good place to catch up with friends and family
2
Service was extremely slow on Friday night. Apparently if you ordered starters they would hold the mains indefinitely. Remb to tell them to start serving the mains.
Other than that food tasted mostly greasy. Not special, average probably.
4
The dining areas are warm and upscale, with dark woods, white table cloths, and some lovely plants. The menu offers excellent variety: pastas, fish and meat dishes, all prepared with an interesting twist. Our meals were really good, and service was top notch!
5
When you're craving eggs and bacon kind of meal- this is the place to be at. It satisfies typical breakfast food cravings, which is just perfect for weekends. Go with family, as a couple or just with some friends- it caters to all kinds of people
4
Great ambience surrounding by lush greenery. The downpour that late morning adds to an even more romantic atmosphere.Lunch was above average to good.. Starter of Crisp & 3 dips was as usual, excellent. Chargrilled portobello mushroom dish was too sour for our liking, even for a person who loves sour food. Chicken parmigiano was cooked to perfection with the chicken breast not being too dry. We finished with a pot of Earl Grey although we ordered Darjaleen... The bill was slightly on the high side, nearly $100 for 2 considering we has only a starter, a salad and a main + pot of tea
4
{ Bianca Fungi Pizza } Consists of portobello, king oyster & button mushrooms, truffle oil and garlic confit.Nothing is more beautiful than the aroma of truffle on a thin sliced charred ring crust that is crisp to perfection. This is what pizza magic taste like âœ¨ #pscaf
3
This is my first time here. When we entered the restaurant, it was almost half full with people although it is lunch time.Ordered Four Cheese Porcini Pizza (V) to share and a cup of Mocha. As this is a gourmet takeaway and retail concept cafe, all the items are served in takeaway packages even if you were to dine in. The staff explained this when I made my purchases. Once you pay for your order, you receive you food pager. When your food item is available, they will page for you to collect from the counter. The pizza crust is thin. I find it too oily and the taste is average to me until I add the spicy chilli dipper. However, I gave extra points because my daughter managed to consume 2 slices despite the fact that she hates mushrooms
5
Great food.. Great service.. Great setting nestled in the middle of what feels like a mini tropical forest.
5
It´s a nice, cozy place with amazing view and a great variety of food! Sit outside and enjoy the greenery!
4
The newest PS Cafe sits upstairs in the One Fullerton Food Mall overlooking the Merlion. It's got an uninterrupted view of the Marina Bay Sands and the nightly laser show. And it is the perfect place to sit down for a drink and maybe something to eat after a tiring walk around the Marina Bay.The food is bistro style, with a small selection of local favorites like Mee Goreng.Spaghetti and Laksa. The steak sandwich is what made this chain famous. It's not huge, but the meat fills the bread and the flavor packs every bite.Service is competent, if a little slow. It's "casual", so the waiters are chill.There is a wide selection of beers, wines, cocktails, and non-alcoholic drinks. And the selection of pastry desserts is on display as you walk to your table. Recommend the Sticky pudding. As good the best in London.Make reservations. While this branch looks big, there are a lot of tourists and lines could quickly form in the airconditioned lobby
5
This restaurant is consistently good. I have eaten in 3 of their restaurants and the food was always good. I have tried many of their dishes and there wasn't one i didn't like. I especially like their dip platters and their salads. I also like their herbal teas. They have good healthy options. The staff is experienced and pleasant. Their cakes are fabulous. I would definitely recommend PS Cafe to anyone. Their prices are reasonable
4
We were taken here by a friend who frequents Singapore. Beautiful garden setting in old army barracks amongst other restaurants only short cab ride from Orchard Rd. Highly recommend pork back ribs ,truffle shoe string fries. We will return when next in town as there were a dozen more items we could have chosen to eat.
4
PS Cafe is set in a nice corner setting. The food & desserts served are very good. However, the prices of drinks is simply atrocious! My guest wanted to order a glass of Malbec wine but it was an incredible $20. Service is friendly albeit a bit chaotc.If they can turn down the colling a bit they would save energy and the guests will also be able to see through the large window
4
We hired a cab to this fascinating place. An old army barracks that has been turned into a foodie destination. A dear friend took us as she is residing in Singapore for a while.Amazing flower display of lilies as you walk in to a busy inside and outside dining area surrounded by beautiful trees.Service spot on.We ordered the Wagu burger, a salad and the chicken penne pasta dish. All beautifully presented and tasted wonderful.Drinks were all lovely.No room for what looked like huge but amazing puds.It was dark and late but would love to return in the day for a wonder around Dempsey village, it's very close to the botanical gardens.Well don
5
4th visit to the original Dempsey Hill location. It was a perfect choice for a work dinner of 8 friends. Setting is relaxing and beautiful without being fussy or too romantic. Staff were perfect on the orders and food was spot on. I had chicken parmigiana, sounds a bit dull, but not here. An amazing healthy and juciy stack of chicken fillets and tomato and olive. Delicious. Everyone's food was fabulous. Pad Thai salad another stand out. And yes we had the truffle fries. These are good and a little unhealthy. The rest of the menu has a mostly healthy twist on fav dishes. Our pre dinner drinks at Green Door bar just next door were a nice way to start. Inside or outside seating. It's all good. Price mid to high, but worth it for the setting and quality food. Put it this way, my 29 dollar chicken at PS beat my 32 dollar steak at a Clark Quay tourist trap joint hands down.
5
We visited PS cafe twice in one day. The first was brunch at Dempsey - I love Dempsey - quite unique mix of F&B - art and antiques - it's a great place to spend a Sunday morning. The PS cafe is nestled in the bosom of nature with beautiful 'jungle' as a backdrop. Their brunch never disappoints - I've eaten here dozens of times and it's Always good. The chorizo and beans, club sandwich, fluffy pancakes and great fresh juices and good coffee make for a great breakfast. In the evening we dined at the Ann Siang Hill venue - elegant sleek black tiles give the place a deco feel. Love it for dinner. I was celebrating my daughters visit to singapore and they chose the oxtail Nasi Goreng off the excellent Asian menu. I had the skate wing and all dishes were truly excellent. They do everything RIGHT. From truffle fries to tasty and well balanced salads and dressings I say PS cafe ticks all the boxes.
4
After our sumptuous and dare we say fiery South Indian food at Samy's we strolled down to PS Cafe. Use the side entrance at Samy's for the short cut. Cocktails at PS Cafe are moderately priced and we loved the laid-back vibe. It also helped helped that PS has a great selection of desserts
5
Great fish n chips ; pan fried fish halibut; breakfast specials bacon egg sausages n toast; fish burger n chips; good food
5
Lovely ambience, place was not too dark even though we sat outside. Good for a romantic date night! Enough fans to keep the warm away. Patrons were not too loud. Their delicious desserts are very suitable for those with a sweet tooth.
4
The burger and the truffle fries are good. The restaurant and garden are beautiful. But the prices are expensive.
4
We ate here after a visit to the Botanic Gardens. The restaurant looks very nice. Friendly staff. Very good food. Rather expensive, count $25-30pp. The soup with sandwhich is a cheaper option for lunch.
5
Great place for dinner or just dessert. Cosy or romantic to sit outdoors (depends on whom you are sharing your gigantic chocolate cake)
5
my 1st visit was about 5, 6 yrs ago & was impressed by all their food selection, as well as their GIANT dessert.. While their dessert fridge is no longer there, and the dessert menu has changed a lot, whereas the atmosphere is stunning, still! I sit there for hours to enjoy my meal, coffee in the JUNGLE. Very pleasant. With their helpful and wonderful service, I'd definitely come back again. :) love their food a lot, although their dessert is bit different than what I had had before.., The portobello salad with goat cheese & the chicken with mixed veg (Mediterranean style? morocco, Indian style? or... anyway, taste really good).. are my recommendatio
4
I always enjoy going to PS Cafe. This time we were at Ann Siang Hill.They opened their doors earlier for us which we appreciate.The place is gorgeous and I ordered Superseed Granola with Chai Latte and he had Big Breakfast with coffee. It is slightly expensive but beautifully presented in a beautiful setting.
1
Where to begin...The side door facing the Main Street left a number of tourists looking stupid wondering where the reception desk is.There was no one manning the reception desk.It took 5min before someone noticed we were ready to order.The drinks served were not what my date ordered.The tomato soup tasted like tomato sauce.The mid rare grass fed ribeye was very average and the sauce was too sweet.The last straw was seeing the two waiters by the bar chatting &a relaxing while the kitchen and front desk reception tried to cover the floor.The only good worth mentioning about ps cafe was the reception was still the same cool guy and interior still had a good vibe
4
I have tried getting a table here on the weekend but have never been patient enough to wait. Finally came here with a friend on a weekday at 11+ am. No queue but there was still a wait as staff were clearly overwhelmed which seems to be quite the norm in Singapore.Anyway crab tart and pad Thai salad and some drinks were all we ordered and were all excellent! Took a while to flag down a staff for the check as the lunch crowd was full on when we were leaving. Great ambience next to some greenery. This place is busy but you can make reservations on weekdays and evenings only on weekends. Good luck!
4
I often visit this little gem at Harding Road after our morning walk at Botanics. It is a much better option than Casa Verde. In the weekday mornings, it is quiet and the seats outside the cafe faces greenery... the sun is just about peeking through the trees and crickets are still singing their song. A plus is that they serve a huge cup of coffee, unlike so many other cafes we have been to that serve in a tiny cup that is so unsatisfactory. They have pastries if you want a light breakfast or if you feel pigging out, the big breakfast is also Ok ( the usual egg sausages and bacon). I felt it was bit pricey for the quality. But definitely if you want an unrushed morning sipping your coffee and catching up with your book or newspaper amidst nature, this is the place
4
Great food offering, service was OK, expected more for the $$$ price paid. Nonetheless a nice location venue for a weekend brunch.
5
We thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and the food here. It is self service and food is served in take away boxes.
Food is delicious and highly recommend the truffle garlic flat bread and truffle shoe string fries.
Do visit
4
Visit for tea on weekday afternoon and the popular restaurant still can get a table easily without reservation. Service is prompt and food is great. What we love most is the atmosphere is very relaxing and the music suits the theme very well.
5
Went here based on hotel concierge recommendation. We caught a taxi to Dempsey Hill which is up the far end of Orchard Road (fair walk from any metro station). the suburb itself is an old army barracks converted into restaurants now and is worth a look itself. PS Cafe is in a really luscious garden area with amazing ambience. We went on a Saturday for brunch and only waited a few minutes for a table. The coffee was amazing; and the brunch menu was lengthy and enticing. I almost ordered the pancakes which the next table had ordered but went for eggs benedict instead. I was not dissapointed. This dish was definitely the best eggs benedict I have ever had. The hollandaise was perfect and not too tart, and the toast was like light brioche (not sourdough). The little pickles also made this dish amazing as they were the perfect balance to the rich hollandaise. Overall I loved this place and will definitely be back. There is also a branch in Chinatown which we also tried and the coffee there was just as good. Highly recommended! No problems getting an uber or taxi back from Dempsey a the end of our meal either
4
We go here occasionally for breakfast during weekdays. The staff are top notch, friendly and helpful. The coffee ($6) is very good, and in generous quantity. The pastries (select at the front counter) are also good value. The scenery is simply beautiful, especially in the mornings, when you can see the sun peeking between the trees. The restaurant is quiet in the weekday mornings (it opens at 8am). The other breakfast items are very pricey for the value they provide (I've tried their bunwich, which should be avoided and the full breakfast, which is bad). I've always found it strange that restaurants in Singapore stinge on food when that is the main attraction, and probably the lowest cost item.So, go here in the weekday mornings for a small pastry breakfast with coffee. You will not be disappointed
5
PS Cafe is a gem in Singapore and unfortunately very popular on weekends for brunch so my 51st birthday July 9th started with a long wait for a table for three. But it was well worth it as the food was to die for. When I was finished I tried to cut my wrists with the leather cover of my iPhone 7 because this was a very beautiful lasting moment in my life worth remembering just before you die. But eventually I had to go to the loo and then forgot all about that plan, as my friends and family were waiting for me at the door anyway...The french fries were covered with Parmesan cheese and infused with truffle oil, good lora allmighty who the heck had that idea? It was tons on my love handles as I needed a bulldozer to shove them all into my mouth!The drinks were Mango and mint leaves in a soda water which was a delight to drink but only lasted 5 seconds, then it was gone!The main dish was bread halves covered with salad and mushrooms accompanied with cheese assortment and a salad sauce that I've never tasted before, it was magnificent! Also only lasted for two minutes, sadly. Then as I said I went to the loo but you now might think I'm putting fingers in my thirst etc. etc. but hey, as they had the mirror covered with some wild jungle plant I couldn't see my face so I didn't find the entry so I just pulled down my pants to do what you're supposed to do when at the loo! Always leave the toilet clean, SIT DOWN even when you only do the pipi. Once I entered the loo, two small boys not even three years old were standing at the pissoirs grining at me saying 'good morning' even though it was noon. They were hardly able to reach the bottom of the pissoir standing there and I burst out laughing...then I forgot to do what I wanted to do and sat down for a pee. Not pie, pee! Well, this place is beautiful, so is the food, and that's why it's packed! My friend said there are horrible reviews about it, but hey, here and there you always have people frustrated with their own boring lives forgetting about the beauty of it itself and nagging at all and everything, don't follow those reviews and see for yourself!Service was kind of unorganized but never slow and never unattentive! Again, place was packed! Reservations are possible, you better

Took my parents who were visiting - service is fair but nothing outstanding feels a bit forced. Food was fine but nothing to shout out about - sharing plates and mains Everyone talks about the ambience being great - again nothing special here (but I have just been to Spain so maybe measuring unfairly) Ok but not rushing back as so many other great options in Singapore
2
First of all the food is good but expensive.... not that is all fine were it not for the poor service.Don't get me wrong... the staff is friendly etc. But the service is just terrible.They have no idea how to serve customers.The staff is not trained at all to be waiters... they have no idea...They either forget you are there or you have to wave your arm is distress to get attention.When you order a drink order everything double as it takes half an hour or more to get one after ordering...When attending a table they will not look at any other table and walk away....This is not a comment for last nights visit.... I have been her numerous times and felt that I will post this now on tripadvisor

As sson as you enter in this restaurant you expect to have a nice evening. Seating is relaxing. Great choice of beers and it offers an amazing diversity of dishes.Without being excited everyone will find something on the menu. In spite of the complex offer the kitchen was running smoothly, even better than the service of beverages. Food served was simply good. Desserts were less convincing

I don't write review but I feel these need to be said because too disappointed with their bad service. Went there for a breakfast for 2 & a toddler on weekday.1. Upon arrival, host was aware of guests coming yet not being prompt to attend2. Not a baby friendly environment. The baby chair is like a bumbo seat strapped in their dining chair. No baby/kids activities pack provided.3. Flat white came with someone's eyelash 'topping' on it, they changed it right away. Coffee was below average.4. Had to wait and ask 3 different waiters until we had our water refilled5. Wanted to order one of their bunwich item from menu, but they said they had run out of the bunwich.Food was not amazing. Paid 82 dollar for 2 breakfast items, 1 coffee and 1 truffle fries. Ripped off.6. The only positive thing about this place is its cozy interior set on a greenery backgroun
4
We had a very nice breakfast combined with a great and peaceful atmosphere. Lovely choice of interior and decoration. Perfect to start the day with a good vibe!
5
Another highly recommended coffee shop in Singapore! Cozy place, delicious coffee and cake, good atmosphere with garden and nature view, interior was also nice with wooden chairs. Feels like home :) It was so relaxing. No need to wait too long to get your table.

Great vegetarian food / Vegan options, really lovely venue. I had the Moroccan vegetable stack and it was great. Really cute place with great decorations.
4
The Dempsey cafe was booked out, so we went to Palais Renaissance on Orchard Road and it is absolutely worth going. It feels like sitting in an organgerie (not surprising when on Orchard Road, isn't it?). Like all PS. Cafe's it is decorated with a lot of taste. The tables are nicely spread around big flowers and plants so it feels quite intimate. Had the best Laksa of my entire stay there
4
Had an enjoyable evening in this relaxing "garden" cafe Besides the signature truffle fries, the ocean trout with soba, miso cod & striploin steak were all of a good standardFound the room a little dark, & seating less than comfortablePrices are reasonable, & there is a good selection of drinks & dessertsRecommended

We came here for brunch on Sunday. For a rather not so obvious venue, it was surprisingly packed. We managed to get a seating upstairs, the place had like an old pub feel but with much more light and no smell of alcohol. The menu was a typical brunch menu however they had their little twist on it - whether its on the garnish, mix of ingredients or simply just the name. I ordered the Wagyu beef burger and can I just say, it is the best gourmet burger I have ever tasted, from the meat to the sauce, to I don;t know what they put in there, it was just delish!! It was soooo good that I forget to start with the healthy goji berry salad which was also tossed and made to perfection. My partner ordered something I tasted but the food coma I was having made me forget what it was - a true must try and It's worth a travel down to China Town just to have the burger again

PS Cafe Harding offers both a simple relaxing dining place and a romantic venue for couples. This goes for both indoor and outdoor tables. They got a decent variety of beers from other countries like Belgium, Spain, Scotland, Italy. We tried their Coopers pale ale from Australia and Mac's Great White Cloudy wheat beer from New Zealand. Good. No bitter taste. The following items are winners from my experience: Crisp and Dip - freshly baked thin baguettes and slices of bread like ciabatta and grissini served with a Trio of dips, including Hummus, cream and tomato-based sauce.Truffle shoestring fries - with grated Parmesan and parsleyGrain-fed beef ribeye steak with shoestring fries and porcini mushroom gravyWe finished our meal with dessert for sharing of sticky date pudding with ice cream and giant salted caramel profiterole (basically cream puff with caramel and vanilla ice cream).Nice way to cap the evening. Not too heavy meal, it was just right.I don't mind coming back here to try the other menu items. As mentioned, they offer both indoor and al fresco dining for a more romantic setting

Visited today (Fathers Day Sunday) right at lunchtime and were shown straight go a table despite it being very busy (they don't take lunch reservations.)Service was friendly and attentive, lots of staff around and incredibly busy but would always stop even on their way to delivering food to another customer so they could check on our enquiry.Food is not cheap ($30 for a wagyÃ¹ burger and chips) and $9.50 for a milkshake but portions are huge and the quality is wonderful. Definitely worth every penny.Gorgeous flower bouquets in the main room and again in the ladies bathroom cubicles. I've never seen such a big bunch in such a small room! The bathrooms were classy and clean.Only fault would be it can be very noisy due to the style of the space, furnishings and the number of patrons. Noise just bounces around the room but most places have a similar issue these days.Lovely to be sounded by greenery when looking out the full wall to ceiling windows.Will definitely be back

Discovered this place after a long saturday night and really enjoyed the atmosphere, the terrace, service and the food. Important to make a reservation in advance or else there will be very little chances to enjoy PS at a convenient hour. If its not too hot, would definitely propose the terrace. I willing to try at night for a drink during my next visit.
4
Went on Sunday Lunch /Brunch (they don't do a specific brunch menu -it is all a la carte )time and of course they don't take bookings so be prepared to wait 30 minutes or more no matter if you get there earlier or later .It is a good location with a green setting at the back and light and bright inside I have to say the food is very good and beautifully presented with a pretty good selectionI have the feeling that many of the customers are there just to be seen and it is a bit "posey " but worth a visit if you feel like splashing out a bi
4
The food was great. Set in a beautiful environment with the jungle all around you. Really beautiful. I would have given 5/5 if the service was better. The waitress was slow and not very attentive
3
My Wife and I had a date night at ps cafe. It is okay and we will likely return - but only because it is convenient to our home. The menu is a little limited and the service is average, even by Singapore standards. Of everything we ate, enjoyed their fried chicken dish - it is much better than KFC!

We arrived at about 1130am at PS Cafe in Dempsey over the May 1 long weekend. We waited, with grandson in tow for a good 40mins.Thankfully the cafe is situated among lush greenery and plenty of trees and open spaces where one could take a stroll in the garden. Nice.The food and drinks were promptly served ...thank goodness as we were famished after the wait.Brunch food was simply delicious. I had the big breakfast and the portion was huge. The chorizo was awesome.Special mention and super yummy was the truffle fries. So very fragrant and delicious.The waitresses and staff there were friendly and polite despite the place being packed. We had a leisurely brunch there and enjoyed the food and ambience.
5
Went here on a Friday night with friends and had a great time. The place was packed but we got our table in exactly 30 minutes which is what the hostess told us upon arrival. While waiting we had some cocktails which were excellent and strong. For dinner I had the burger which was delicious - fresh tasty bun, big hunk of wayyu beef cooked to my specification with bacon, cheese and cartelized onions. The truffle fries on the side were so good too. Service was top notch. Highly recommend this place

Had a wonderful dinner at PS Cafe. Arrived a little late due to traffic, were seated at our table near a very noisy group who were clearly there for the long haul. We mentioned this to a staff member and were moved to a better location outside. The restaurant was nearly full and buzzing. Our order was promptly taken and drinks and food arrived in good time. We both had Chicken Caesar and a bowl of their delicious truffle fries. An excellent meal. Started with a Gin and Tonic and if you like this, they have a menu of Gins from around the world. Monkey 47 was my choice. Staff were very attentive and very pleasant. I noted a lady at a near by table who had a gluten intolerance. After a conversation with a waiter, the manager came out and discussed a meal option with her, all seemed to be resolved.Great atmosphere and decor.We have also eaten at their location in the Paragon centre and can say the food and staff were great.I see there are some mixed reviews but our experience has been really positive
5
From the location, decoration to my dessert, love every bit of it. Has been in my "Must-visit" list since many years ago, finally made it! Prefer to have my sit outside facing the greens and quieter, the interior sound proof is not ideal. It is definitely a fantastic place to have a relaxing afternoon tea with besties. Will surely be back again :

After a week of indulging in many of the local cuisines Singapore has to offer I was craving some decent 'western' food for brunch. An expat colleague of mine recommended this place for its coffee and setting so I thought I would check it out over the weekend. It definitely lived up to the recommendation, the food (I had eggs bene) was fresh and cooked perfectly...the setting was lovely, a little bit out of the way which was nice for a change...and the decor was something I'd typically enjoy at home (Sydney) and the coffee was definitely on par! Best coffee I've had in Singapore! Service was a little all over the place, friendly but they don't seem to cope well with it being so busy so long wait for table service and water etc...so if you are going on a weekend, I'd recommend allowing plenty of time as there might be a line! (Food came out quick though once ordered)
4
We stopped in for a relaxing drink and a break from shopping. We didnt have anything to eat, but were surprised by the size of the meals being delivered to other tables, they seemed very generous. We had intended to return to sample something from their menu, but ran out of time. May be next time! A good selection of drinks, both hot and cold on offer and an amazing selection of gins
4
My niece knows I do like a visit to PS Cafes in Singapore, so she took us over after lunch at another restaurant in Tanglin Village for coffee and cake.We were seated quickly but my niece advised we should have booked as it is always busy, we ordered coffees and a sticky date pudding, which was delicious.On leaving my niece purchased some bread which was very tasty the next day.It was nice to get out of the storm but I don't know if I would travel all that way again to visit here when there are PS Cafes that are closer
4
In our 5 days in Singapore, P.S Cafe was the most expensive one but don't get me wrong. It was delicious. We took Eggs Benedict (classic with Salmon & with Ham) and Pancakes. The eggs were really good and the pancake was average. Great Brunch Menu
2
We are family with kids...the waitress are mostly with Unfriendly face serving us...my son accidentally vomitted and none of the waitress even wanted to help clean...Food is ok
3
We were looking forward to a pleasant evening dinner but unfortunately, our orders were lost and we were kept waiting. Fortunately, the manager was quite alert and apologetic and served us complimentary truffle fries and dessert. Hopefully they sorted out their back room operations soon.
2
Cake with Ice cream was served with no utensils. Requested for a spoon and after 40 minutes nothing has been given.
I have also asked for water and been waiting for it for 15 mins and nothing is served.
Totally disappointed with the service
4
Located in a nice area & near Dempsey. Has indoor & outdoor seating. You feel like in a garden house. The food was yummy except for the chicken sandwich that i didn't like at all. The service was very good & staff were friendly. They offer sone homemade style cakes & desserts. Drinks menu has a variety of options between alcoholic & non-alcoholic drinks, coffee and tea selection.Worth visiting & then you may have a walk around the area. The cost for 2 persons was around 105 USD
2
Went for lunch and was placed at a table outside, lovely surroundings. Two things that were disappointing was the level of service and the quality of the food. From a service perspective our starter and mains came together, no explanation given and as all were hot we had to accept, We had a pad thai salad which was insipid at best and a rib eye steak which was a poor excuse for any type of steak and at $54 was simply a rip-off. We had also asked for extra vegs which never turned up.Finally we both woke up the next day with large numbers of insect bites - would help if PS Cafe could put up a warning sign. In summary lovely place, plenty of parking but overpriced for poor food and service
4
Tucked away in trendy Dempsey Hill is the charming branch of PS Cafe where people flock either due to word of mouth or coming back for favorites. We went for both having been accustomed to their more accessible Paragon branch and their truffle fries, which has had a following. First, their servings are generous. It's hard to finish their fries on your own even with a big appetite. Also tried their Portobello burger which was also enjoyable - and healthier than the beef variety. Service was efficient and courteous. Although their prices are not the friendliest, you get more than potatoes and mushrooms here. The place, in itself is social media worthy
1
Came for breakfast now that it starts at 8:00. The location is brilliant but the prices are ridiculous. My wife had the chorizo hash - it cost $29 and came with ONE EGG. Really? Fail. I can't drink milk so I had a soy cap. My wife's normal cap cost $6.50 - OK, fine. Mine? $8.00 - that just means I won't come again. It's too bad.
3
The location is just fantastic. Nice scenery view. You don't realize you are in the middle of Singapore. Other than that, the service is poor. They forgot to take and bring our order. At the moment we wanted to pay, nobody seemed to bother and it was not even that crowded. Further, the cappuccino we ordered was cold! Bear in mind that you pay for the location; don't go there when you are thursty, it might take a while before you get your drink
1
What a disaster. Three different waiters forgetting orders, no follow ups. Served starters with main course, forget one main course. Served wine with unidentifiable grains (no winestone) and replaced the glass with exact the same amount of wine before. Messed up the bill, were unable to issue a proper receipt. Never ever again. I am really upset as I brought my biz partners there many times. But this was an embarrassment.
3
I was really looking forward to having a brunch at this romantic spot. Reading the menu I was excited to taste the Moroccan Miracle Stack which seems to have amazing ingredients and fusion. I was super disappointed to find a tasteless dish. The server was kind enough to take the dish back. Overall the service was alright, the other dishes we had the burger and sticky dates pudding were good but nothing to drool over....
3
We use PS Cafe (s) a lot, the food and locations always drag us back, but the service is and always has been pretty terrible.
Go there for great food selection and amazing drinks menus, just expect nothing from the staff.
5
Food and desserts are something to die for.The location is in nature with lot of greenery and trees around.My 2nd visit here and the Burger is a must if you are a non-vegetarian.
5
The environment is fantastic. Foods are good especially their tiramisu. Overall it's a nice place to hanging up.
5
PS cafe serves up an impressive brunch. The menu has something for everyone. The quality is very high and the price is very fair.
4
Went there with a group of friends for coffee and desserts. Staff was really helpful, location overlooking the green scenery is really nice. Try the banana fudge cake!!
5
Had a lovely brunch and enjoyed the al fresco dining-- a nice change from the city center.
Good brunch choices-- enjoyed my Eggs Benedict and the truffle fries
3
I had called ahead to ask about their Saturday brunch busy times and the person there said it was 11-2 on Saturday and Sunday so we made sure to arrive earlier than that. The service was extremely slow: 20 mins for them to take our order (didn't even ask if we wanted coffee and didn't bring water!) and then another 20-30 for the food to arrive. I say 20-30 because not everyone's main arrived at the same time. This is really annoying - we were NOT sharing. This place could be so much better with more staff that are better trained and a larger/faster kitchen team. A real shame because I'd love to come here every week with the gorgeous surroundings and atmosphere but the service is just too slow to bother.
5
Been twice to this restaurant. First for late lunch, second for brunch. Located in a secluded and private area near Dempsey Hill, I couldn't express more on the ambient. I am very particular with view and so far PS Cafe is my most fave in Dempsey Hill! I love how they put the green element by building the restaurant near the trees, giving the soothing feeling of being in the city everyday. Brunch menus are awesome! with different flavors of cakes on the display counter :
5
To celebrate a work anniversary of one of our employees, my husband and I took her to PS Cafe. We let her choose, and she clearly chose wisely! We loved it. From the amazing and plentiful drinks menu, we each chose a cocktail (PS Cafe are known for making strong cocktails, and they didn't disappoint!) We then headed into main courses, along with a lovely bottle of Brunello de Montalcino, followed by desserts. Not one thing I could complain about. Fantastic food. The Miso cod that I ordered - even though it was the most expensive at S$48 - was the best of the mains that we ordered. The desserts were all great - a tie. Highly recommended. (A bit pricey, mind you, but really great for a special night out.
4
The truffle fries deserve a special mention. They are the best I've ever tried. Beware, they're deadly and it's a gigantic portion. The salads and sandwiches are great and I love the dessert selection. The ambience is nice and sort of care-free. Lovely for lunch in specific
5
Excellent cakes and incredible location. Go early to get the best seats and relax over nice tea and excellent cakes.
4
Nice brunch restaurant facing a piece of greenery that creates a relaxing atmosphere outside. Inside it feels a little bit busy and noisy. The food is really good and the cakes are enormous in size. 1 cake can feed four persons 😄
5
The restaurant has good decoration and the concept of this restaurant is take away concept even you eat inside the restaurant. Food is good recommended pizza (quite big 8 pieces for 3-4 people is better) fries also good taste ! Coffee and cake also homemade ice cream are recommend. I been there on Sunday around 11.30 Am is quite busy but staff is very friendly to help and guide us because this is my first time here. The price seems high but reasonable for me. Not too expensive around 20-25 $ for Pizza, 12$ for fries and 5-10$ for drink.The location is quite far from the city, I took MRT from Tiong Bahru and take bus 1 stop and then cross the road until the end of the street. 10-15 minutes walk with a local view is good !Recommended !
3
The environment is nice, getting darker each time I go. Until we are not able to see our food. It's good to have drinks, snacks and chill.I have been here 3 times, first time the food was good. Second time was okay, this would be my last time eating here.We have ordered chicken, fish, asparagus, beef burger, truffle fries and lava cake. Truffle fried and lava cake are the best food for all of us, others are normal and not outstanding anymore
5
PS Cafe has a very peaceful, relaxed atmosphere (perfect for Sunday afternoons). The staff are very efficient and friendly. The food is always amazing (been there a few dozen times), if you don't finish it you can always take it home. As a healthy eating person, I ordered the 'Superfood' salad. It was much heartier than I expected (in a good way)
4
PS cafe has been around a long time and yet it continues to do well!! I love the Dempsey Harding road branch which feels like I m dining in LA and not Singapore. Food is decent, decor is chic! The owners really know how to decorate the place and make it cool yet comfortable!! Music can be a notch higher when the place gets crowded to keep the vibe!! Overall, still one of my favourite restaurants in Singapore!! Great for dates on weekday evenings!! Weekends and brunches tend to have too many kids but weekday evenings you can dress up if you want and go for a date!
4
Bene wanting to take the family here for a while and at last managed to do so. We booked in advance as its rather unlikely to get a table if you just walk in, its that popular. I'd booked inside but it was mild outside so they managed to swap our booking.My kids can be picky eaters but they managed to find something that kept them happy. I was sure the salads were smaller last time and so ended up with a salad and a burger and the two together were a bit of a struggle they were that big and delicious.Despite everyone being so full we had to go for the dessert, the double choc cake is a mountain of a cake but my son gave it a good effort and had still half to take home with him. The key lime pie was nice and tart and the sticky date pudding really did have more of an ocean of toffee sauce.We all rolled away overfill but pleasantly so.Looking forward to coming back here agin
4
Great location in Dempsey and superb work by the interior decorator - this place feels special whether outside or inside seating. Service is professional and fast. Cuisine is European / NY and a bit uneven (i.e. Fantastic Asian version of aioli but premade chunky fries). Prices are high but almost worth it for the experience alone
3
I'm pretty sure anyone who patrons this cafe did not come for the food but the view it offers. Hidden behind lush greeneries on top of a little hill, who would've blamed them? The interior deco breaths old-school elegance with dim lights that casts shadows everywhere. However, the food itself was average at best and with the price it came along, not worth it at all. The desserts were so-so (I had the key lime pie but it tasted so artificial and the bright green color was a put-off). I would not come here again. I would, however recommend this for first dates if the male wants to impress his counterparts that he could afford pricey food whether or not it was worth it
4
Has been a Favourite ever since we found it many years ago. Good food, great location but the all the fav is alway the cakes, it's has never failed as a pick me up. Love the decor and flowers that makes every visit slightly different, only pain is the possible waiting time
5
Very lovely restaurant in a green landscaped setting. In and outside seating available. Food is excellent and service professional. Visited by many expats. Odd thing was this huge boquet of flowers in a rather small lavatory.
5
I've taken so many friends to this restaurant and its always been a great food experience. The menu is extensive and the desserts are amazing.
5
Came here on recommendation from a local friend and were not disappointed. Food was amazing. Service was good and attentive. Venue surrounds also great. Highly recommended.
5
I aways come back here time to time.
Love the ambiance indoor or outdoor.
You always know what to expect when dining here and they are pretty consistent with the food.
5
First time visit but will definitely return. The staff were wonderful and very professional. Best of all was the food and the environment.
5
The entire family of 4 adults and two kids enjoyed PS Cafe on a Friday night. Got a reservation relatively easily. Food standards and service is high. One of my favorite places to go because parking is a non-issue and he ambience is fantastic for a concrete jungle like Singapore. The penne rosa chicken, ribs, lamb chops and truffle fries stand out in this restaurant and after all these years they have still managed to serve great food.
3
I came with my family, very good food but service is unbelievably slow and lackingPeople are standing in the queue while tons of tables are available. My juice came with the stickers on the fruite inside.The place is great, the food also very good but the service is really inadequate
4
Daughter And Son in law took me there for my birthday food was great but they don't have smaller meals for kids you have to order an adult meal.Also ordered a second bottle of wine just before mains were still waiting for it when they paid the bill
5
I went on Tuesday the 21 to P.S Cafe for lunch. When entering the restaurant all the staff were very helpful and professional for finding a table for my family and I. The PS Cafe had a very nice staff called Jerry who was very professional, helpful and gave excellent service. The experiences I had was outstanding. There's a nice fresh green environment which felt very comfortable and refreshing
4
This PS cafe is set in Dempsey and surrounded by lovely greenery. Visited on a Sunday and had to wait for 45 minutes for a table. Once we got the table the service was efficient. The burger unfortunately was overcooked, however the eggs Benedict were well cooked. Overall an enjoyable excellent but expensive - we spent 200 for three including two drinks each.
4
If you enter the restaurant have a look to the right and you will not be able to miss the cakes. They are massive and suprisingly tasty. So leave a little room for dessert. It is worthwile.
5
Great restaurant in lush jungle setting at Dempsey Hill. Great western food with an asian touch, huge pastries.

PS Cafe is a restaurant located over at Dempsey Hill. I went there yesterday for dinner and was welcomed by warm and friendly staffs. I made a reservation for 1800h but was late and reached at around 1830h but I was still attended to within 5-10 minutes, which was great. We were brought to our table and was told that there is a usual menu and a special menu, which is written on the walls. Generally, the restaurant is rather romantic (dimmed lights, jazzy music). We ordered the truffle fries for $12 and it was one of the best truffle fries I've ever tasted. The truffle oil smells so nice and the portion was great (can be shared between 2-3 people). For mains, we had the trout (usual menu) and the snapper (special menu) and they were great too. Portion was not bad and taste was definitely good. The snapper, in my opinion, is better than the trout. Both mains were $36 each. For dessert, we had a glass of champagne (Ayala Brut Majeur) which was one of their boutique wines not on the usual drinks menu. It was $23 per glass and it was not bad. The alcoholic taste wasn't overwhelming and it has a tinge of citrus and floral taste. We also ordered the chocolate nut doorstop cake. It was $16 but rather good portion and came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream as well. It's a good choice for chocolate and nuts lover. All in all, the restaurant is rather cozy and nice although it can be a bit noisy indoors since people are just talking loudly. I would suggest sitting outdoors if you guys want to have a proper conversation.

If you're in Singapore and contemplating sleeping in on Sunday or rolling out of bed for Brunch, then PS Cafe is a brunch place that will definitely make up for choosing to roll out of bed. Its a building surrounded by glass that looks out to lush greenery. The view helps to energize you on a lazy Sunday. Atmosphere in the restaurant is of high energy, wait staff are attentive, efficient and welcoming. Food selection itself is varied and even though it is the brunch menu, you are still able to taste the exotic and the refined. We had Truffle fries, Moroccan mushroom, and a variety of breads and dips

Dempsey Hill offers a diverse number of beautiful restaurants and cafes... along with antiques and collectibles! But of all the eating establishments ... PS Cafe reigns supreme. Unfortunately they do not take bookings forLunches so expect to wait a maximum of 20mins... but it's usually less and their waitlist is very efficient sending you a text when your table is ready.I am obviously not alone in my opinion judging by the endless stream of patrons waiting for tables to be vacated. Situated amongst the bush makes indoor or outdoor dining very pleasant. Staff are attentive and run off their feet but always willing and helpful. Food arrives remarkably fast and you won't be disappointed!! Not a cheap place to eat but worth every cent. Gorgeous setting, delicious food and a wonderful ambiance - what's not to ❤️???!

We made a mistake at the PS Cafe. We went for dinner. The restaurant/cafe is attractively situated on the edge of a small park in Chinatown. We wandered in and decided to have dinner based on the eclectic mix on the menu.They mistake made was assuming from the pretentious decor, menu, staff and location that the courses would be correspondingly small. They weren't! We picked a couple of entrees. Pork rilette and truffle fries. This would have satisfied our great hunger. Both were good.But our assumption made us order mains as well. We didn't eat half of either. Not because we had already eaten our fill but because they were far too rich and my Lulu's left over lasagne didn't have any 'left over' meatballs in it as advertised. Perhaps Lulu didn't make any meatballs the day before.If the restaurant management reads this I would strongly recommend you tone down the training of your waiting staff. I didn't know until tonight that it was possible to be so annoying by over attendedness. We didn't need our glasses of wine and water moved half an inch each time they walked past.Don't make the same mistakes
4
I had heard that PS Cafe was great for brunch, but we went for dinner. It's often difficult for a day time place to convert into a night time place, but PS Cafe did not disappoint.We ordered the truffle fries, lamb chops, pork chops and steak - every dish was plated beautifully and tasted amazing.But, the cocktails were the star of the show. Very, inventive cocktails, and each one was delicious.Only disappointment, but not in control of the restaurant, was that there was a heavy downpour the night we went, hence we didn't get to see the luscious green view

Came here on chinese new year day 1 and it was packed. A nice place to visit as it's next to the jungle, so it has outdoor ambienceOrdered the salmon eggs benedict and it was good. My friend's prawn pasta and pancakes looked good too but the prawns looked undercooked. Another friend had the Big breakfast and it didn't look nor taste goodMy bellini only came after 2nd reminder to 3rd waiter. Not coolFamous for their puddings, we ordered ginger and apple/toffee. When it arrived, we told them who ordered what. After 1 bite, we realised they got our orders mixed up. Not cool agai

For lunch they offer 'soup and sandwich combo' which is pretty good. Wish they had more stuffing in the sandwich. It's a whole lot of bread. The ambience is good. The drinks were pretty good and the other dishes that my friends had looked and tasted pretty good too. So the whole group was happy with what they had ordered
5
From ambience to food to service, name it all but PS cafe has everything rolled into one. I always visit here when i bring friends for comfort food and dine it when i need an alone time. Love every food they serve! From those little bites to salads to big portion mains! It's guilt free eating. May i just mention that their sticky date pudding is to die for!!! It feels home here everytime!
2
It's a very noisy place. A waiter refused to add a sirup to a latte despite the fact they had sirups. It's too expensive for such conditions.
4
cozy and beautiful place at Dempsey Hill, satisfied with all dishes that i had but not satisfied with customer service.
5
Great overall concept and set up. Food is ideal for all day dining. Hope to come back and recommend the place when I get the chance.
5
Enjoyed lunch w family . Food fast , service was very good & attention to beautifully plated food. Parking is a few meters away & there's steps down to restaurant entrance. My picky daughter enjoyed her penne.
5
This is the 2nd time I've dined here and it's easy to see why it is so busy on each visit. A lovely big restaurant with a decent sized outdoor dining area. The food and drink is delicious (Brunch Burger and Chocolate Milkshake). The staff are really efficient and the food arrived in a decent time. It might be worth booking a table in advance if you have a larger sized group as you can end up waiting a little while. It is a little more expensive than other restaurants but it is totally worth it
4
Always happy to be able to return to this restaurant. Have enjoyed most of their entrees over the last 3 yrs. Would always recommend my friends to go there or to one of their outlets. Food is a little pricey though but most of the time worthwhile. Reservations is almost a must. Their desserts are simply wonderful
4
This was our third time back to P.S Cafe and we've loved it each time. It's great for a birthday or special occasion, with a calm, sophisticated atmosphere and delicious food on offer. We felt that desserts are where P.S Cafe really shines, and the Key lime pie is sumptuous and top quality. It's pricey however, and a dinner for two without wine can happily exceed S$100. Will definitely be back!P.S, One portion of chips is more than enough for two people
4
We reserved online from the uk prior to our holiday from 21 dec to 1 jan. We were celebrating my parenrs 60th wedding anniversary and the 30rh birhday of my daughter. It definately is my fave place to eat and we used to live in Singapore at Tengah 1970/1971. This was my fourth visit back to Singapore and our last time was in 2008. The food is excellent and staff friendly and helpful
4
The food at PS Café is great, but what makes this café the ultimate dining experience is the native jungle that surrounds the café. This can be enjoyed on the verandah, or inside through the floor-to-ceiling windows. It is very relaxing and makes for an ideal brunch on the weekend. It is hidden from view so persevere in your search (we did) and you'll be pleasantly surprised
5
PS Cafe may have started as a "cozy cafe hidden in a clothing shop," as its website suggests, but its branch at Dempsey on Harding Road no longer qualifies as a cafe but a full-blown and top-quality restaurant. My wife and I had a nice Christmas dinner there a day after Christmas, as Christmas night was fully booked with a set menu offering. We really don't like being forced into set offerings, and prefer to choose ourselves what to eat from their full offering.We are not big eaters, so we shared as main meals the Gado-Gado (Indonesian salad), and the Ocean Trout on soba noodles (Japanese influence). Both were excellent choices, and whilst from different cusines, complemented each other quite well.We sat outdoors and faced the forested area, which was very nice and made the ambience quite romantic, as we enjoyed the meal over a nice bottle of merlot from Napa Valley
5
Went here with family and friends and impressed with the ambiance, surrounded by great scenery and lots of flowers inside. Although food may be a little on the expensive side, it was Delicious
5
Love the set up and the food is always great. The staff is very service oriented and always have interesting suggestions on food and drinks.
4
Love their desserts, tasty and presentable. The view is amazing, it's a great space where you can enjoy 100% tropical chill in the afternoon.
4
Very nice food in a. Nice setting but I thought not exceptional. However I enjoyed the visit and perhaps for Singapore it is not considered expensive.although I would say it is.
4
I brought my staff here for Christmas lunch after two other delicious visits here. Just love the rustic atmosphere and sitting outside this time of year overlooking the trees in the green dress you would never know you're in the heart of Singapore city. The first three times here I got the turkey and cranberry sandwich, with bacon, which is one of the best sandwiches ever ever in my life!! This trip I got the chicken parmigiana which was just okay. They left the skin on the chicken so my first bite I felt a gooey rubbery texture which doesn't belong in a chicken parmigiana. The truffle parmagiana fries are to die for and very grate ample fresh parmigiana cheese on the top of it. They have a selection of awesome fizzy drinks like lychee mint, lemon mint, and others that are almost like virgin mojitos. And finally make sure you try the deserts, all of them are delicious and worth trying. We got the chocolate nut cake shown in the picture below which was really really rich but amazing. We also got the butterscotch banana cake which was delicious, and the carrot cake which was just okay...The staff is friendly and helpful, and the service is really good. Will definitely be back again And definitely ranks on "highly recommend" lis
5
A charming eatery hidden in a lush green corner of Ann Siang Road has been the go-to place to celebrate birthdays,farewells and Christmas lunches with friends and family.It is best to book in advance, as the place is always crowded.Their portions are very good; the desserts are old-fashioned, decadently rich and are a meal in themselves
5
A cosy cafe hidden in Dempsey Hill, is perfect for a lazy afternoon, sun downer or a romantic dinner. It's lush green and beautiful surroundings ooze good vibes and extra points for their outdoor seating. Tried their red wine sangria and by far the best one ever! Also do try their truffle fries...but beware the portions are humongous so much so that we didn't have place left for main course. Nevertheless, a great overall experience. P.S. the desserts at P.S. Cafe looked fab!
5
During a brief stopover in Singapore, recommended to go to this restaurant ... and not disappointed. Lovely setting. Great atmosphere.Service very very good and friendly.I had the super salad - delicious - and S had the brandy marmalade chicken. Wonderful.Desserts are huge - share one between two
4
Love this place that I was back 3 times last week to have dinner. The ambience won the day for me. With the lush greens and beautiful plant and flowers arrangements, this place was a relaxing place to chill after a day at the office. I love the beef burger and always ordered this dish when I visit. The service was excellent! Hoping to go back once I return to sg.
4
I have been here easily more than twenty times since I am based here in Singapore. We didn't make reservations so it's a 30-40 mins wait if you want an indoor table. It's November so relatively cool for singapore so we were okay with a table outside. Ambience outside is nice, the rain just stopped so you can hear crickets chirping. If u enjoy nature this would add another layer to the ambience. We had Ayala Brut champagne to start off. Skip right to mains. We had Spicy King Prawn Aglio Olio, Powerfood Salad and Shoestring Truffle fries. The pasta was great, with right amount of olive oil and chillies and spinach. The Powerfood salad brings together blueberries, roasted almonds, sunflower seeds, goji, baked pumpkin, quinoa, broccoli, baby spinach & romaine, orange rosemary dressing. Love this! If you are a fan of fries, u got to try their shoestring truffle fries. I order this every time I am here. Dessert we had Doorstop Chocolate Cake, check out photos. We close the night with cappuccino and chit chat - great hang out environment
5
Pros;
1. Effective and most anticipated wait staffs.
2. Foods are excellent, delicious and reasonable price.
3. Clean ambiance.
4. Good wine selection and price is good as well.
Cons;
Nothing I can remember
4
Cool interior and lush surroundings. PS Cafe can get very busy so be patient if service is a tad slow. However, portions are generous and you have the option of seating inside or out on the veranda area
5
Had a lovely dessert date with my girl today. We ordered the sticky date pudding, truffle fries, and banana butterscotch cake. Would totally recommend these desserts to any sweet tooth out there.
4
This PS Cafe is in a lovely position, surrounded by greenery set in Dempsey, an old colonial military camp. Food is always good, a predominately western menu with an Asian twist, good for salads. Interesting drinks selection and cakes to die for.
5
Just 3 of us there after dinner for drinks ... Lovely time spent .. Atmosphere added to the company ... The head waiter and our waitress Amy was friendly and efficient. Look forward to going there again .
4
We went for brunch on a Saturday morning. Love the location at Ann Siang Hill. Ideal location for a early brunch. Food is good.
3
I like the view over glass window and overall deco / vibe but food is average. Plus a bit too crowded likely due to online hype. Services was slow as a result?
4
2016 May 2 @P.S. Cafe, Dempsey. Fell In Love With P.S. Chocolate Peanut Butter Cake (Rich & Not Very Sweet). Have Returned To This Cafe With My 3 Children / Friends To Try Out More Dishes & Desserts. Beef Burger, Fish & Chips, Shoe-String Truffle Fries & Salad Are Good. Great Hang Out Places Even For Adults /w Children. Children Can Play On The Field Outside And Parents Monitor Through The Full View Transparent Glass Panel
4
This place is located in demsey hill. Very nice ambiance and perfect place for a nice relaxed brunch/ You definitely need to make prior bookings as this place it packed . There are both outdoor and indoor seating area. The smoothies and the shakes are to die for
3
PS cafÃ© has a good reputation but when I came here for a coffee and cake, I was disappointed with the latte. It was more expresso with a little bit of cream and did not taste well. The cake was good so that was a consolation.
3
The restaurant is indeed situated serenely and is certainly amiable enough.
Notwithstanding our brunch was rather insipid, the lasagna in particular was rather devoid of sufficient seasoning, a tad disappointing.
4
We went here for lunch it is in a very lush green area of singapore..
No high rises actually you could be anywhere tropical.
Lunch was plentiful & tasty.
Cake portions are huge.
Good price
5
We loved the fish and chips and the fine fresh juices we had. They have Nice wood balcony that surrounded by trees and nature. Go there when u visit the wonderful botanic gardens just near by.
5
We like the ambience there and staff was friendly. We had a wonderful Lunch there. We did order some dishes and quite feeling .. can't finished it..
reasonable prices and nice good there, I like their sandwiches is really good.
Thank you 😊
5
Great spot for lunch, in a lovely garden. Service and food was very good. Spent a leisurely couple of hours here just enjoying good food.
5
This is a wonderful spot in Singapore to get away from the city and have one of the best lunches in the city. Very hip place but with excellent food and treats. Love the truffle fries and salads. Service is good but the cafe is always busy. Don't miss in Singapore
2
Nice location. And thatÂ´s it. Service is really bad. Food is just soso for the price you pay. Long waiting for table and order food. Just paying takes 15 min.Very noicy atmosphere (loud music and no sound reduction for laud talking guests).I think you can find a lot of better brunch restaurants in the area
4
We are so pleased we got out to this place. A taxi will take you there and it's not that far. Beautiful setting. Lovely friendly staff, and food was up there in pretty good category. The presentation of all meals was second to none. I loved the counter display of all treats and flower decoration. Such a gorgeous interior. I loved the atmosphere and would go here again. I will warn you though it's not cheap by any means but all meals were pretty big, fresh, tasty and very well presented. For me overall it was reasonable. the clientele was a good mix of family, friends, locals and business. Know a good thing when I see it.
5
We have finally booked a table for family dinner tonight - on a Saturday. Reservation was handled very well&pleasantly. Food, wine are impressive, service iz even more amazing, from the gentleman who received us to the waiting staff who looked after us throughout our dinner. Will certainly come back soon
4
PS Cafe does a great job with the ambiance, and the restaurant is set in a beautiful location in the heart of Singapore, away from CBD. Like many places in Dempsey, the food is overpriced and quality good, but not great. Visit with guests or special occasion, but consider somewhere else if you are looking for great food and great value
4
Great food, fantastic outdoor seating, excellent service and very friendly staff. This place is welcoming and definitely worth a visit.
5
PS Cafe was a pleasure to go to, fresh and vibrant in both the food and decor. The food is a modern version of classic dishes with excellent salads sandwiches and deserts to die for. Good selection for vegetarians.
4
We went there because they have gluten free cakes,took our grandson,for a special treat.We ordered chips but they didn't come,cakes arrived first,then they gave us the chips in a box to take home which pleased our grandson.Helpful staff.
4
Big group booked and overall god night, smart restaurant with great staff. Food simple and decent range beers and wines
Only thing is it's not different enough, loads of other place would eat before going back to this one
4
Nice place with delicious meals and helpful staff in a different surrounding than the town. Friendly atmosphere with guests from all nationalities transiting through Singapore. Highly recommended!
4
Place: it is tucked away on Dempsey hill, with a green outdoor area. The decor is appealing, the layout well done.As you enter you walk by a row of cakes which looks amazingly appealing.The food: the food is of good quality, served simply with good quality ingredient. We had the Hummus, the Superfood salad, roasted pumpkin, truffle fries.It all tasted good and by the smell and plates of the people around us, it seems good.The wine selection was good.The service: was quick and the staff was friendly.Value: good for Singapore. Even with two glasses of wine it was reasonable
4
Drove a couple of circles and couldn't find them. Fortunately the folks next door was able to share this hidden location with us. Restaurant was well occupied considering it was a late weekday afternoon. Atmosphere was just definitely relaxing at the outdoor seats as the chatter were not so distinctive. Lunch specials were sandwiches with soup which I don't have have any particular desire for. Pastas are my weakness and this prawn aglio olio definitely made waves of happiness in my heart. Mix it up well though. Cause the good stuff are lying under
5
The PS Cafe's first store in Singapore, it was a hit then with a natural view of the forest. Absolutely loved the setting. All PS cafes are stylish with a taste of old English style. The price is also not that steep although it is not cheap either. The cocktails are about $16 dollars and main dishes are ranging from $26-$35. Do try out their famous shoe string truffle fries which is really my favourite
5
We have eaten at PS CAFE many times over the last few months at DEMPSEY. It is consistently good. The staples on the menu are very tasty and the specials change daily. They are creative and inspiring. Of course the desserts are legendary and very generous portion sizes. Definitely a go to spot when friends are in town or just want a lazy long lunch.
5
Great venue to spend a relaxing weekend afternoon. Lots of outdoor smoking area, great selection of desserts. Fantastic Pecan Pie.If you intend to take a stroll out on the lawn, make sure to douse yourself with insect repellents or be eaten alive by the mosquitos
5
I liked the atmosphere and also food was tasty. enjoyed with my friends who finished symphony orchestra performance in the botanic gardens want to visit again
5
Went for late lunch after botanic gardens. Also do brunch at weekends - we had "tea" basically a main and dessert. Very good food and great service. No rush, no fuss. Will call a taxi for you (about $12 to Chinatown)
4
Our family enjoyed their Eggs Benedict/Florentine/Big Breakfast etc. Service is fast at 10am although the crowds were coming in as we were leaving.
4
Met friends for a brunch catch up. Got there early at 9h30 to ensure we got a table. Great patio outside. Food was good and we'll presented. Good service from friendly staff. Recommended
4
PS. Cafe is a Wonderful place, this is the perfect place to chill out! What a setting amidst in a tropical Jungle surrounded by old colonial military barracks, from the moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was captivated by its ambience. The soft lighting, relaxing music, unimpeded view of the greenery, and rustic décor made this the perfect place for friends’ gathering. The restaurant also serves enjoyable delicious food, great fish and chips, and superb wine list .The staff service was very nice. Everything was great! However, it was quite expensive. But I guess it's the price you pay for quality food and service. Highly recommend a visit
4
PS Cafe's location at Demsey is very unique, difficult to find for a 1st time visitor. It is well hidden from the main road and even from the rest of the restaurants at Demsey. The ambience is great at the restaurant and they offer both indoor and outdoor sitting. Surprisingly the outdoor sitting is more popular on a Sunday evening.We tried the main courses of Fish and Chips, spicy king prawn Aglio Olio and St Louis ribs! All selections are great choices! The fish and chips was surprisingly good, uses Red Snapper fish with Tiger beer batter, served with thick fries on the side. Also tried the desserts, they serve huge slices of cake. Tried the Florida Key lime pie and sticky date warm pudding with vanilla ice cream. The pie is slightly more sour than we could have like it to be. Sticky date was a great and sweet choice to end the meal!Service was prompt and attentive when we visited. Reservations is highly recommended. Prices are high, do be prepared to pay more, however portions are reasonably generous
5
We were a table of 8 and dined here on a Saturday evening. The place was full and buzzing! The first thing that caught my eye was the vast array of gins on offer, the second was the selection of cakes - I knew this was going to be a good evening!The staff were friendly & attentive and I was pleased to see that being gluten free was not going to be a problem.We ordered starters to share, a selection of bread & dips plus some prawns & calamari, all very tasty.I opted for the ribs served with a delicious slaw & fries (the slaw was really tasty & not a drop of mayonnaise in sight!)We tried several gins, all quite different in taste, my favourite was Monkey 47 (I think that was it) very aromatic!I selected the flourless orange cake to finish with - the largest slice of cake I think I have ever seen & unfortunately just way too much for one person but delicious all the same (puddings to share would be my advise)A great evening indeed, good food, great service & ambiance I would recommend this restaurant without hesitation
4
We had a primary school gathering after 10 years of each other here and it was the perfect place to meet everyone again! The service was always alert and were full of smiles. Everything we asked for were brought to us immediately despite the restaurant being full! The food was amazing!!! The portions were awesome for sharing too!! Word of advice: Always make sure there is space for one of their yummy desserts! You will not regret it... Also, try to sit somewhere in the middle, it got alittle warm into the night.. Or maybe it was just the Moscato & having a great time that got us all warm!! :
4
A fun lunch was had here. The restaurant is bright, airy & has a cool friendly vibe. The food of western staples (salads, soups, sandwiches, pasta, burgers & meat dishes) are all fresh & easy on the pallete. A satisfying meal & a great place to catch up with friends or family. Well patronised by the expat community, dining here is an easy choice as the menu's varied enough to have something for everyone. The Dempsey location is my favourite for its outlook over the lush verdant gardens of Dempsey Hill. Reservations are recommended as it fills up very quick!
4
A lovely diner in Dempsey Hill with a interesting array and mix of dishes with specials daily. Very busy restaurant with lovely dining space outside. Had a variety of starters which was very good . The Steak was nice. The Desserts were outstanding and service always excellen
3
Besides that, food is ok but totally overpriced. Service hectic, not enough waiters for the crowd on a busy Saturday night. Will I be back? Frankly not sure...
4
The location right in the middle of the jungle is very nice, The food choices are good, especially the sandwiches. Staff is always smiling which is nice. A good spot to have a bite in Dempsey Hill.
4
Great atmosphere
Good quality food, menu may need to be enriched though especially starters
Service not always at top level especially if restaurant is full
Great choice of desserts.
Should offer free WiFi
5
Literally everything was amazing! Appetizers, main, specials and of course the dessert!!!! Excellent service, beautiful location, and delicious food! This is what you look forward to
4
They don't take bookings, so you need to come early to get a table, or be prepared to wait at least 45min to 1 hour for brunch/lunch on weekends as this place is very popular.We came for lunch midweek (last week) and got a table straight away - food was fabulous, service great and no complaints from anyone at our table.Yesterday we met friends for brunch and arrived early (around 10.30am) so we didn't have to wait for a table. Again, we couldn't fault the food and service - my water glass was continuously filled up (although I do miss the flavoured water that they used to have previously!)Although not cheap, the setting at Dempsey Hill and the food makes it certainly worth a visit
4
There are few outlets of PS cafe. Whereas the one at Harding is full of noisy brats, the outlets at Paragon and Ann Siang are more for the refined. Food is slightly exotic but do not expect them to go for a Michelin star. Portions are generous but the prices are not cheap - you pay for what you get. Go for the daily specials and leave some space for the desserts
5
Loved the menu of this resto. Most ingredients were very healthy. Plating was beautiful. And the place was very pretty--both the interiors and its hill location. Great service from staff too. Will definitely go back for brunch to try the other great stuff in the menu.
4
PS Cafe dempsey area is one of their first branches! Airy, cool, with a nice greenery view outside. Very relaxing vibe with beautiful big flower arrangement (well done by Philip the owner himself)! Have been coming here since day one, but never bored with their beautiful atmosphere. Food is so-so but I would come just to soak up the atmosphere on a lazy afternoon or Sunday brunch
4
This is a casual restaurant with good food, laid back and nice ambiance. We had cod with miso and snapper as main course and both were excellent! Please do have crispy fried white bait as an appetizer, you won't regret it! Reservation is not accepted so be ready to wait for 10-15 mins.
5
Been to this restaurant for few time now and the food quality is totally one of the best. The ambience and the music is just perfect to relax and enjoy your day. But what totally impress me and my friends about this restaurant is the customer service and I would like to name Mr. Jeffrey for being consistent in looking after all the customers and serving them with very unique charm that is really impressive. He is very friendly and he looks after the diners very well. I remember when my friend told me that kind of customer service that PS cafe is giving is very rare now in Singapore. So please keep up the good work in making all your customer happy. Will be back soon
4
Must try their cake!
Food Big portion and relax environment
If you love vintage great for you! Great for brunch with friends and family
5
Celebrating a friend birthday today . Good food and great ambient. Definitely will comeback someday when given the chance. Must try their dessert. One that you will never forget.
4
What a fun place with fabulous food. Great for Kids n adults alike. I love all day breakfast meals. Great decor and good service.
4
the PS café has a good menu with choices for all tastes , it is a comfortable restaurant with a good selection of wines and drinks , so if its a quick lunch or a longer evening meal this place is definitely worth a visit
5
If you are looking for something different yet the same try PS cafe. I went to the one at the Paragon Shopping Centre and I was blown away by the food. I highly recommend the laksa pesto. It's a local currified noodle chock full with sweet long beans, fishcake and spice. It's an interesting taste and I can't describe it the way it tastes. It's an iconic dish so you should try it. The dessert spread is another eye opener and I mean you really open wide your eyes when you see the size of the muddy mud pie or the many layers choc cake. It's rich and sinful and your taste buds will simply explode with the utter chocolatey taste; if you are a choc lover that is. And you just try their citrus lime and soda. When it first came it looked like a garden of greens in a glass. But it's sweet and tangy and wakes you up with the zest. A must try.
5
Been here many times and its always a treat to come here. Good food, good ambience, friendly staff and always a lovely air of fresh flowers. Its even more inspiring when its located in a location like dempsey. I requested a sofa seat for birthday celebration and they were very obliging. Highly recommended portobello mushroom soup, louis ribs, truffle fries, cranberry turkey sandwich, and banana cake for dessert.
2
The food was quite delicious . I paid $85 with taxes for a glass of white wine , PS Steak Sandwich with truffled fries and a double chocolate cake with ice cream . The three items did not justify the price tag of $85 . The setting looked as compare to their branch at Palais . There were only spilt air-conditioners and it was very warm . I am not sure if it was supposed to be an outdoor setting . I guess it was not as there are spilt air-conditioners .The staff was helpful and accommodating . She gave me the normal fries instead of the truffle fries for my PS Steak Sandwich but she changed it for me. Lastly, the toilet was filter and poorly maintained . The water drainage was not covered . The tap was leaking . The basin was very wet and the floor was quite wet. It was a put off to see both used serviettes on the floor and a stack of wet serviettes beside the basin . I will not return to the Dempsey branch again . It is the Palais branch for me .

PS Cafe has grown from strength to strength, from a humble beginning as a boutique cafe for clothes to a very solid comfort food.I’ve never had a bad meal here and the PS Onion Burger is one of my favorite menu items, so is the Portabello.Desserts are solid as are the Sangrias. The ambience is very quaint but there can be mosquitos outdoors. It’s my “too lazy to make a choice” automatic option when I want comfort nouvelle cuisine!It’s definitely not cheap nor overly expensive for Singapore. More upper middle but with solid consistent food with a strong menu, and the wonderful green surrounding, no wonder it’s a popular weekend brunch place
4
Went here for dinner. Food was good, looks like very popular so if u want a quiet dinner its not ur place. People were everywhere and talking out loud, I need to ask my friend to repeat all what he is been said since its very noisy there. New waitress made mistake several times since her english isn't good enough whilst talking to my British friend
5
Food was excellent. Staff very attentive and polite. Excellent choice of drinks too. We had the platter as starters. Fish and chips tasted so good. The olio aglio with tiger prawns was excellent. We also ordered the pork ribs which had nice flavours to it. Not too pricey. Good value for money. Portions were huge too
4
Very nice location in a beautiful setting, very chilled out and relax atmosphere, comfortable terrace, entertaining background music accompanying tasty freshly made food and a good variety of drinks. Can be busy at times so don't miss out to make a reservation.
3
Great ambience but the food is overrated!!
The mushroom soup was tasteless
The fries were too salty
The fish and chips were soggy!
The medium well ps Burger was too rough and dry
Nothing really worth coming back!
3
Food is not bad. I like how original and tasty the salads are.
Nice environment in a nice neighborhood but as many places in Singapore is overpriced.
5
Very enjoyable lunch today with friends.
Service staff was very good and friendly. Have been here few times for tea but had lunch today. Special mention to Zac for his cheerfulness!
5
The restaurant is surrounded by trees, nicely decorated and with great floral smell. The atmosphere is awesome! Came for light drinking and desserts. Even I am not a dessert person, I have to say the cake is superb.The restaurant is quite busy so usually service would be hard to keep up. Yet overall I would consider the experience to be a good one!Good experience usually won't be cheap in price but I think it is worth it
4
Went for dinner here with my dad to show him the Dempsey Hill area. We chose PS Cafe because we felt like something light and fresh. We shared the dips, followed by the salad special of the day - seared tuna garden salad and some fries. The food was delicious and the staff were friendly and attentive. We also ordered two of their soda infusions, lime and mint and ginger and lemon. Both were refreshing and perfect for a warm night. Lovely garden setting and a nice spot for dinner.
5
Really enjoyed dinner with a client, cocktail list is extensive, service is great and the food was different and flavoursome. We tried the prawns, eggplant and tofu (which was bland) broccoli and the fish lasagna. I will go back nect time in Singapore! Outdoor seating was beautiful, the furniture is alot better than the picture and very much French Colonial
4
Always liked PS Cafe at Palais Renaissance. Food are generally good albeit a bit big on portions. Lots of comfort food to choose from. Some people may think their burger is too expensive for a burger but this is no fast food place. Besides, their burger tastes much, much better than fast food burger so it's not even comparable. Also love their bolognese.I like the ambiance too. Love all the floral arrangements including the one in the toilet. You can usually tell the Pedigree of the place based on the washroom
3
Somehow PS Cafe is always on my to-go list of cafes in Singapore, but we were very disappointed and dumbfounded by its food after we ordered delivery from the Paragon outlet. Ordered a PS burger, beef stew and bolognaise pasta. The pasta was alright, the burger was just average, but the beef stew was terrible. Above all, the stew smelled bad and tasted weird (a little sour). So we wondered if it had gone bad and decided to throw it away, which was such a waste considering how expensive the dishes were. It was my first time trying the mains and I wonder how much the standards have dropped.
2
I think the PS cafe at Palais Ren and Ion are better. Some dishes which we regularly order at the other two branches were prepared with no thought. Amongst the mains also the food ordered was below par. Surprised to see no kids menu maybe because it was a Saturday. I did get priority for a table as was with kids but there were 5 different servers for ordering to checking out. Confusing and irritating. never coming back
4
What a lovely setting for breakfast lunch or dinner . Service is first class and a very good menu. Quite expensive but worth the visit .
5
Had a great dinner, beautiful quiet location though the menu choice for vegetarians is not so vast, the lychee sangria was great.
5
The location, the interior, the food, the drinks, the dessert(!) the staff and the company. I loved it all.
5
Perfect service, with very great food and lot of choices. You can go blind and take anything, you will be very happy with what comes in front of you. I would recommend the house burger, very juicy and tasty... but everything is great.

This is the fourth time we have dined at this cafe. We sat out on the deck, and despite it being evening, we were not bothered by mosquitos. We were a party of six - myself, wife, daughter, son-in-law and our two grandsons. We started off with cocktails - a mojito, prosecco, a ginger Margarita, a blood orange Margarita. The Grandsons drank root beer and a cranberry juice. Main courses consisted of two fish and chips (X three pieces of schnapper each serving), three beef burgers with side salads and no chips and one Bolognese. This was accompanied by a bottle of Chardonnay - "Margaret River" (au). The adults finished off with flat white coffees accompanied by Zambuka shots.However the lads in the course of exploring the premises, for friends, during courses, they charmed the Maitre'D, who most generously, gratuitiously, awarded them a huge "slab" of double chocolate blackout cake (of their choosing) - which was to 'die' for. (The lads allowed each adult to sample). As in Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon 's "The trip to Italy" I finish this account of a another most enjoyable dining experience with the total cost was S$ --- and worth it !!

So the restaurant is at the end of the street and on 3 levels. It's quaint with a good vibe. - however, it took probably 30 mins to order drink,- that in spite of the fact that we were seated within spitting distance of the bar. Similar timing for the ordering of the food and eventually the bill. They didn't seem understaffed, rather the staff just didn't seem to be overly bothered with the customers. The food was very nice,- and the wine, while pricey (it's Singapore after all) was excellent. Based on the food alone, it was a solid 4, maybe a little more. - BUT the service drags down the overall score.

P.S. Cafe is the best place to hang out with friends, enjoy a nice meal with your family or even enjoy some dessert by yourself. The food is of extraordinary quality and taste. The service is exquisite. I personally have gone here on many occasions and enjoyed it every time. I definitely recommend it!

PS cafe is a long time favourite spot for a reason: it serves good food and offers decent service. Sounds simple but remains rare in Singapore...The restaurant doesn't take reservations, so you may wait a while on weekends, but you will always get a table (unlike so many restaurant that do not let you in while empty because they are full booked, year right!).Prices are on the high side, because they can. And it is justified by looking at the food served and the general environment

I always like the setting of PS cafe as it is surrounded by lush green. Normally I have gone for brunch but today we went for dinner. Mixed reviews on the food. The truffle fries are amazing, but cocktails didn't turn out too spectacular. Spare ribs were great, hamburger decent but ordered as medium and came as rare. Curry was good but quite spicy and my pasta was very average. We had no space for desert although I have to give it to them, all the cakes look fantastic. Overall price was pretty hefty for an average dinner

Caught up with friends for dinner at PS Café. The décor is great and we were given a table in the corner looking back through the restaurant at the amazing flower arrangements, just perfect. I had chilli prawn pasta and my friends had chicken parma and fish and chips. All were well cooked, fresh and delicious. For dessert I had a pineapple meringue which was a sight to behold. I am giving 4 stars simply because of the service, unfortunately it was slow and at times non existent. When we did get a server they were friendly, unfortunately everyone in the restaurant needed to continually put their hand up to get any attention and considering the price of the meal I think it's one area they can improve on
3
I like the place. It's so nice for a family to come and chill out on a weekend, it has a big garden.. The food wasn't that amazing and the service wasn't great I thought. Probably coz it was packed.
4
We had a lovely meal with a couple of other families - and they accommodated us even though there was a mix up with the booking. Good pasta dishes and very decent wine.
4
Was here introduced by our dear Singaporean friend. Pretty takes minutes away from city center to reach here. As usual, smoking not allowed but that's good.. We order few sorted cake and taste all good!
4
Love coming here to chill with friends and nibble on truffle fries without feeling Tok guilty because they are worth the calories!
Dessert is good and in generous portions.
Good ambience and service.
4
Its good for a regular lunch or dinner, especially if you are not expecting very much based on food variety. Setting is very nice. Prices are a little steep compared to similar concepts in Singapore. Very good selection of Gins and tonic waters.
5
It is a lovely place at only 15 minutes drive (without traffic) from Orchard Road and it is in the middle of a park. Actually, this is an old British military camp that has been transformed in a trendy place with galleries, restaurants and cafes.I really appreciated the architecture of the cafe with its large windows that create a very specific atmosphere with a British touch. And the food and cocktails are very good. I strongly recommend you to try their homemade cakes, they are fantastic.But nothing is perfect: no reservation so you will need to wait to get a table as it is a very popular place during the week-end and the service would need to be improved.If you come to Singapore, you have to go ther

Located in a nice green corner in the Dempsey enclave. Love to relax amidst the greenery & the abundant cut fresh flowers in the cafe itself. Food is good though a tad more pricey than most cafes & service is spotty especially when it's crowded. Go early for breakfast or brunch as it gets crowded and noisy & you may have to wait for a table. Was there on a weekend & had relaxing meal with the family till the crowd start streaming in
2
Luckily for this restaurant that the food is good - otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it.The waiters are overworked, unfriendly and seem harrassed - no matter how many time's I've visited this place, it doesn't improve.Orders usually come late and are often wrong.But the food is good and especially their deserts.Reasons to go: Good Food, location and ambienceReasons not to go: Not for the fussy, impatient or those with accustomed to good quality service. Be prepared to wait and lower your expectations - count yourself lucky if you get salt & pepper on your table and enough napkins and cutlery for everyone
4
It serves up pretty good portions of ribs, fish and chips, penne rossa, etc. which are some of my favorites at this restaurant. When you enter the restaurant you are essentially walking in the from the back. The front of the restaurant faces an open green space. Very unusual in Singapore. Service is excellent but it gets pretty busy most days. Suggest a reservation a day ahead.

Why 3 stars? It's an average of the sum of the following- 5 stars for very friendly staff and service - 5 stars for the ambience, surrounding greens, alfresco sitting area and shady trees coverage (watch out for the blood thirsty mosquitos though) - 3 stars for the food. It has the usual all day breakfast offerings and desserts. Food is good but doesn't rank in my all time greats list - 1 star for the food delivery. 40 minutes wait from order to the arrival on the table. Came on the public Labour Day weekend. Granted the delay could be due to a busy Labour day weekend but for a professionally run cafe, they should have planned for it. Hard to swallow the level of food order service for the level of cafe
3
The food is good here the Dempsey location is excellent although zoo many mosquitos outside.
This never disappoints. But the menu can get a little boring. Would love more choices.
5
Today we tried PS cafe in Paragon, food and staff were amazing! Every time I come to Singapore I make sure to eat here. I think there are 3 locations. Palais is my favorite for atmosphere but Paragon is also amazing, staff was super attentive.
3
very pleasant setting! especially outside! good variety of food(international cuisine)service was everage although too noisy inside! all in all! don't mind comming back!especially that it's situated in "Dempsey hill"!magnificient setting............
4
I loved the location and atmosphere of this place. We had to wait for a while before getting a table (no reservations accepted at the weekend) but it was nice. My own dish was not that great (pasta with prawns and aioli), I found it dry. But I tasted some other dishes ordered by the people in my group, and these were great. Hubby fell in love with the eggs benedict
4
You need to book but these restaurants are dotted around the city. They off good hearty food in a relaxed setting atmosphere which is friendly to both adults and families. The puddings are to die for! And the slabs of cake are awesome!A must visit if you're in town.

Lovely setting for this Singapore Cafe, surrounded by trees and not too far away from the Botanical Gardens. Extensive menu with specials too. We arrived for an early lunch at twelve noon and easily got a table. It filled up quite quickly. The only disappointment was that a couple of the specials would not be ready in time for our lunch. We had truffle chips as a shared starter, very taster. Two different salads with very tasty chicken breast, a rack of ribs and a burger. All excellent. Two of us had yummy deserts. Glasses of iced water were constantly topped up. Service was efficient. Very pleasant lunch
1
Summary; great location, average food, ridiculous service. I've been at PS Cafe several times and I always come out with a frustrated feeling. The reason it's reasonably busy here is the location, definitely not the service. It starts when you get in and you're being treated like you just entered the Royal Palace and they're security checking the tables hence there's a 30 minute wait for a half empty place. If you're lucky the food will arrive however never at the same time as the people you're having lunch with. Trying to get out and pay the bill is another obstacle you need to get through as by this time the waiters are so confused they might have totally forgotten about their own existence. Anyway, you're going to try this place as your expat friends have told you it's such a nice location. And they're right... They just forgot to tell you about the challenging coming with it. For me, I'm done with it. I'll never come again. It's simply not worth the hassle. I can't wait for the managers reply... It's definitely not their fault, that's for sure
4
So good! The food is amazing! I go there a lot with my family and friends. Service is amazing, the staff is incredibly friendly and hospitable. The food quality too is amazing. It's a great place for brunch or lunch and its a perfect place to just hang out with your friends.
4
Came here for lunch and it was pretty busy. The burger was really good as well as the pasta carbonara. Although we were stuffed, we decided to have the dessert and the chocolate cake as well as the profiterole were really good! It is a pricey place
4
Would give this place 3.5 stars if possible so am rounding up! Is one of the most popular places for brunch in Singapore and the nice open space, lush green view and dessert justify it. No reservations for brunch over the weekends so best turn up by 11am to avoid the queues.However, on the negative side it's not amazing value for money, even sat inside it's quite warm. The mains are pretty standard but the service really does let the place down. It's hit or miss and I've waited 20mins for the bill before which is unacceptable.I do highly recommend the Sticky Date Pudding which is sensational. I nice venue to take visitors but it could be better
4
It was busy so worth booking in advance. Lovely location, well decorated and relaxed atmosphere. Staff were more attentive here than most places we ate at. Food was really good, great selection too.
2
I must admit I had higher expectations. Awesome set up--mood lighting, beautiful ambience, great menu. Service needs desperate help--extra table setting not cleared, no notification on serving of mains--ie entree only just arrived, soiled dishes sat on table. Cooking technique-- pasta was badly undercooked; not to al dente. I was just frustrated after my first bite into forked tortiglioni. But enjoyable flavours that are not localised. I'll give it another go but I'll think about it.

My partner chose P.S cafe because I had a cakes craving I needed to satisfy. Was stunned by the prices on the menu the moment i sat down. Everything was overpriced. We ordered quite a bit for a tea time binge. Roasted roma tomato soup - my partner said it was nice and thick but i think it was close to $20.GOLDEN BANANA BUTTERSCOTCH - DA BOMB! I ordered this despite it costing me $14. Very expensive for a slice of cake and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. But the cake was so moist, so good that I wanted to pay another $14 for a second! Assam and fresh mint Moroccan tea - both were okay. Nothing spectacular. Very pricey for the amount we had, but overall satisfied. Will definitely come back for desserts but food wise, probably somewhere else
5
One of our regular brunch restaurant for Sunday. My other half loves this place and I have to agree that the food is pretty food. No complains there, but the best part is that it has great atmosphere and we have brought many friends from home with us and they were always impressed
3
My friend and I went to PS cafe for lunch/tea on a Sunday. As expected, it's pretty crowded and slightly noisy. We ordered shepherd's pie, served with mushroom soup and club sandwich, followed by brownie with icecream. The food and coffee did not disappoint though the price is slightly steep. It is fine dining (price and presentation) at a rowdy place.When the bill came, I saw a carrot cake on the bill which we did not order. I told the waiter about the mistake and gave him my credit card at the same time. He went away for a long time and came back explaining to me that they have some issue with cancelling the cake, and if it's ok for me to go ahead with the credit card payment and he'll pay me cash back for the cake. I agree as it does not make a difference to me.The cake is $11, and he came back with $12. I didn't really want to fuss over it, but he is obviously under-paying me bearing in mind that there's a 10% + 7% additional charge. I point out politely that he may want to recalculate as even a 10% charge will total over $12, and that there is another 7%. So he came back with $12.80. I didn't want to teach math again so I just left at that. But the cashier should understand that the total cost of the cake is not $11 x 17% (=12.87, so I'm still underpaid). It is $11 x 10% = $12.10 x 7% = $12.95. It's not a matter of being underpaid that matters, but at a restaurant where my total bill came to almost $100 for a sandwich, small shepherd pie and soup, one coffee, one dessert... It is embarrassing to be telling the waiter to recalculate and still get underpaid
5
This cafe is very cozy and well covered by tree, it can be many mosquitoes but get the indoor seat will be fine.The decoration will wow you by wall of flowers! Staffs are very attentive and The food is delicious and unique, make sure order their truffles fries~ BIG BOWL and heavenly

Having lived in Singapore for three years a visit to ps cafe in Dempsey was always a treat, great food, atmosphere and service. Having returned for a quick business trip, my visit for lunch was disappointing at every turn. Nearly thirty minutes before attracting the attention of the many wait staff who were in a hurry to go everywhere else other than take the order for my table and the guests at the table next to me. The Gado Gado salad had changed beyond recognition and was a poor imitation of its former self. The same lack of interest in tables when trying to pay the bill. There are too many other choices ps cafe - improve or risk customers no longer visitin
5
We were recommended this by friends and wasn't disappointed. Brunching at its best!All dishes are beautifully presented taste fantastic. Very buzzy and busy place on a weekend we had to take a ticket and wait 30mins to be seated however the food that followed was definitely worth the wait.Tip : Make sure u order your own portion of the truffle fries... Simply the best :) was so great we went back to just have the fries as a snack
4
Daughter and I had lunch today. Been several times myself. My daughter first time and loved it. Special place because of the greenery and beautiful fresh food. BUT we ordered on the menu FRESH JUICE. We noticed the lime juice was sweet. So I asked the waiter about the juice, is it fresh and have you added sugar. He told me they buy the juice elsewhere, and just put a fresh lime in it. Basically it is $8 cordial. I hope you read this as it is wrong to mislead people and especially customers who don't want SUGAR! Fresh juice to me means FRESH SWEEZED. That's why you don't mind paying more. I would like a reply
5
I just love this place. Food is good, consistently. Nothing mind blowing, but good quality ingredients and prepared well every time. Service is always great. Often they have younger trainee staff but they are trained well to be very attentive and proactive, which makes a difference. The best part about this place is the outdoor seating area. One of the few places in Singapore where you can eat and look out onto nature, no buildings! Its the perfect place to have a lovely warm, breezy afternoon looking out on the trees and listening to jazz. Perfect. Its very expat oriented, so expect the prices to match. i.e. its not a cheap meal
5
Never failed to impress the people I brought to this cafe. The place is just so lovely. Enjoyed the food and drinks and especially the cakes!!!!
Love the surrounding greenery. And free parking... Very rare in Singapore.
4
Nice atmosphere and great cakes for desert.
We had a quick lunch and the food was well prepared and staff friendly and attentive.
Clear need to make reservation in advance since mostly it is fully booked.
Nevertheless food is tasteful and enough choice.
4
As you walk in the fresh smell of flowers hits you, the food is delicious and the truffle frays are amazing, the deserts are out of this world, eyes bigger than my belly comes to mind
5
What a find this delightful cafe/restaurant was and such a change from the mainstream city. Set in the green leafy surrounds of the historic military barracks complex atop Dempsey Hill, the cafe is surrounded by lush greenery. The eatery is airy and light with large glass walls. An obvious favourite with the expat community you would be well advised to book ahead. Menu offerings were excellent and reasonably priced. Food was well presented and of excellent quality. The beef and guiness pie a firm favourite with our group. As expected beverage prices were high but then that's Singapore.An excellent venue and one of the best we've eaten in during our stay. Highly reccomended
3
Had lunch here in January for the first time with some friends. The food is good and specifically the location is very nice. I do believe that the prices are fair but a bit on the high side but that is for many places in Singapore the case. Definitely will come back here when having lunch with friends or informal business
4
PS Cafe at the top of Demsey Hill is really nice and a great relaxing setting. Especially the outdoor terrace. Quite pricey though but service was good. Demsey Hill is a nice area to have a look at various antiques and furniture stores also. Have a look at the beautiful parrots when walking up from the Holland Rd bus stop
3
It is our 2nd visit and if it was not for the setting I would easily rate it 2 only. The place is beautiful, old colonial building in the midst of greenery... But the service is really bad... It took 20min to bring our coffees, some of the dishes came before and after 15min of ordering it, we were told that one of our dishes at run out. Really bad organization, managers should spend more time training their employees because this is the worst service we have experienced in Singapore. On top of that, the food is nothing special and very pricey.
4
This is a great place to meet up with friends for an informal meal or evening tipple (or both!). The bungalow like building with a double height ceiling and, floor to ceiling windows on one side looking onto an open expanse of wildly growing greenery is something quite special in highly urbanised Singapore.The dining room - divided into 2 sections with different types of seating benefits at lunch time from some very nice natural light. Having dined mostly at lunchtime, I was surprised and delighted with warm and cosy glow of the dining area on a recent evening visit. While I do prefer the menu at other ps cafe locations (all available online at the restaurant website), the chill out vibe here can't be beat. The sandwiches and pasta are nicely prepared and tasty as is the iced logan tea. They serve good coffee and unpretentious generously sized desserts too. I've noticed the burger and truffle fries are favourites with the other diners.It can get a little noisy when the restaurant is at full capacity. Service is friendly and efficient. Keep it going Ps Cafe!
5
Whenever we visit Singapore we enjoy brunch at PS Cafe and enjoy the consistency in food and service. With its relaxed atmosphere and lovely setting it is easy to see why it is popular with families
5
Newly weds and new to Singapore, celebrated our 1st month anniversary at P.S Cafe and what a foodastic experience! Fresh ingredients, amazing taste and appealing food presentation with a picturesque view and lively atmosphere sums up our experience. It has become our go to place for special celebrations now. Can't wait to go back and try their delicious looking burgers :
4
We had a delicious lunch this week at PS Cafe Harding! Fresh ingredients and tasty food. Service was a let down - had to ask a couple of times where our coffee order was and after a 20 minute wait gave up!
5
This place is always fun and relaxed. Love their
Cake selection. Service is adequate but not intrusive. Fish and chips are the best. Truffle fries are popular. Coffee is not great but ok. Long waiting during weekends.
4
Went to celebrate a friends birthday & I enjoyed the ambience. Price of food is medium to high but it's quite tasty. Will return again.
5
If you don't have a car, you can get a bus going to this restaurant and walk about 5-10 minutes inside the compound. Ladies, don't wear high heels unless you have your own car or will be taking an Uber. When we arrived in the Restaurant, it was really loud inside. We didn't think there would so much people on a Thursday night. Good thing we had a reservation and we were seated in the lounge Area which was beautiful. We ordered the soup of the day which was a seafood chowder. It was so-so but the main meal was awesome. We ordered the Prawn Aglio Olio and the Spare Ribs. They were really delicious. They were pricey but not over the top. Eric our server was really attentive and gave us a cake because this was my birthday dinner. Even without the cake, Eric was awesome already.Even though there were a lot of people, the dinner still felt romantic. Highly recommended!PS. For peak hours/times, please order at least two mains. Some only order one and then share this plate and stay far too long in the restaurant which lessens their covers for that night. ;
4
Nice food and drinks, excellent service from people who know what they sell and service and a great place to have lunch, diner, coffee and excellent cakes and tarts and having a nice chat
5
Before experiencing the cafe , I always Thought that it is very expensive! But I was totally wrong! Went in to the cafe, was greeted by one of the managers(I suppose, cause her shirt was different from most) requested for an outdoor seating, brought to our seat, but changed to another as the floor was filled with ants. Informed the staff about the issue and the manager settled it very quickly (closing the section, and elimating the ants) Went at quite late timing, so they have a downsize version of menu, but still it's a lot to choose from.Ordered double chocolate cake, and ultimate fudgy brownie for sweets, truffle fries for savory , honey lemon and mint like soda everything for less than $80 for 3 pax. The portion was so huge that we can't finish everything!! They serve ice water without having to ask, which is a plus point! Ambience definitely fabulous, perfect for dates, gathering and celebrations! Definitely will be back to try the other menus!
4
A very fun place to eat. The decor is different, which makes the experience all the better. The food is great and so is the service. I recommend going in any group size. The menu is very fun to chose from. There is something for everyone. Feels like a getaway in the middle of the city
4
We had tea on a slow weekend afternoon with relatives visiting from Europe. While the kids were running about in the grass patch, we adults had lovely coffee and tea, paired with their lovely chocolate and other decadent cakes! A relaxed atmosphere set in a wooded area of Dempsey that's not too crowded for a Sunday afternoon. Couldn't ask for more.
4
We eat here regularly - lovely ambience, particularly if it's cool enough to sit outside among the greenery. Special mention for the juices and the smoothies, which are always delicious, and I LOVE the corned-beef hash.Agree that the service can be patchy at times, and being unable to book can be annoying at busy times - but we keep going back, so something must be right about the place.We've also eaten at their places in Tiong Bahru, which is a funny self-service joint, and in Paragon, which is always chocker with the 'nappy valley' brigade.Thumbs up from us, with the caveats above
4
Surrounded by thick greenery, a soothing ambience with good choice of food and nice service. Go for an outside seating for that feel
3
This place has a great location and solid food but the service let's it down sadly in terms of knowing the menu and all round customer service. The menu is really broad which is great. Prob give it one more chance.
4
Had brunch here with family great area, lots of mature trees and shade. Great outdoor dining. The food was tasty had the quice, it was served with a salad.
There are lots of fans outside so its a bit cooler.
Would recommend.
5
Super After-Dinner coffee or tea and desserts place. Set beatifully in a glazed shed and with friendly and energetic service from youthful staff. really cool.
4
Well positioned on Dempsey Hill, with easy parking, PS CAFE provides a friendly, chilled atmosphere and good food. Family-friendly too. We had a great meal together.
4
Set within the Dempsey Hill cluster, sitting out on the back balcony makes you actually feel like you're in a tropical setting, as opposed to the normal concrete jungle of Singapore. The food is usually very good, although from time to time, their menu changes seem ill conceived. Their original steak sandwich was incredible but has not been part of the menu for many years. For a great, quick, but comprehensive lunch, go with the soup and sandwich.
4
The way from central Singapore. The food was nice enough, the truffle fries is a must. My fish was lively and light, the burger looked good. The service was decent. The beers were bottled and cold. I would say it's more suitable to brunch or lunch. I doubt I would go there again as it's pretty far out from the centre
4
Third visit food standard and service still same and good. Love the pizza still nice and crispy hot. Try the new item kampong fried rice it's fantastic nice and fragrant. Will go back again
1
It was 915pm and we (3 of us) decided to have dessert at the PS Cafe at Paragon. We sat down, ordered, and twenty minutes later, we asked the waitress where our dessert was (huge slice of one of their cakes). She then proceeded to tell us that they have a policy where each person needs to order something! It was almost time for last orders so instead of letting us have the cake in their empty restaurant, they enforced this policy and didn't even bother telling us this when we first ordered! Ridiculous rule and terrible staff -- we of course were very annoyed and left. Pity as I was quite fond of eating at PS Cafe... until this incident
3
Cakes are good, coffee could have been good if the sugar and creamer came with it. The shop was not particularly full at thaf time
5
We joined friends for a Sunday brunch at P. S. Cafe and loved every aspect of the experience. From the sangrias to our main course to the pastry dessert it was all delicious. We sat indoors because it was cooler but the proximity and view of the jungle were beautiful. Prices are a little high but not surprising in Singapore
3
Shoestring truffle fries...best in Singapore! Huge pile, good for sharing. Love their desserts too. Main courses so-so.
4
PS Cafe is one of our very favorite places in Singapore. It is remote from Orchard Road, yet on the doorstep. It is stylish, modern, progressive and very well done. The owner likes flowers, consequently the flowers are always amazing (in the toilets, too!) The starter salad is probably one of the tastiest salads you'll ever experience - fresh, vibrant, bursting with flavor. For mains try the lamb kofta curry, I often chose it! Accompanying wines are plentiful, but we like the Mt Hillary Shiraz. This is a place we have recommended to many people. Sit outside and experience dining al fresco in the tropics. We'll be back
5
Situated in Dempsey Hill, former British barracks and nutmeg plantation, it's a nice environment to relax and enjoy a meal. Favourite dish for PS Cafe for me is the truffle fries, Moroccan miracle stack and miso cod - in this order. If the heat or humidity doesn't bother you, sitting outside with the view of the garden is the best. Desert is on the sweet side if that's what you prefer
3
Firstly, a beautiful stylish restaurant, classy, well furnished and designed with indoor and outdoor seating in Dempsey hill. Hard to find and dimly lit but lovely atmosphere with good music and tables are nice and far apart. Pretty awful service unfortunately, largely due to the very low staff count on such a large place. The staff could really benefit from some customer service training, it became a farce by the end it was so poor.Disappointed with the food, my ribs were nearly completely all fat with no tender meat but chewy tough meat. The jacket potato on the side was amazing though. Looking at other people's table's perhaps I had made the wrong food choice.Wine was lovely although expensive. Desserts are huge! More than enough to share with a least one person. Very tasty and rich.Overall I would give this place another try in the future - maybe not on a busy Saturday night. I wouldn't recommend it on this visit but feel it has so much high potential to be a really great regular haunt
4
This place gets incredibly busy at weekends, but they have a good system in place for keeping track of the queue, which means that you can go for a walk while waiting. Food was a good mix of brunch, salad and western comfort food. The truffle fries are amazing! Juices very good too. Lovely location, feels like it's miles from anywhere.
5
A gorgeous restaurant with amazing (big) food and great juices. We came here on a hangover and it was great. The food is all pretty massive so be careful with ordering too much food. The juices are freshly squeezed.Really nice interior, kind of like New York bar - brass and antique mirrors, dark leather furniture. Very cute.Amazing cakes I've been told
4
PS cafÃ© is the perfect place for a quiet drink or a sneaky little meal. Nestled on Dempsey Hill surrounded by trees and you can sit in or outside. They have a great menu with some wonderful delights and a great wine list. Next time you are on the hill give them a try apparently brunch on a Sunday is amazing. The service was great and friendly. Great place just to unwind after a long day

PS Cafe at Harding Road is located within the Dempsey Hill Enclave that is a lifestyle haven. The grounds of Dempsey are quite large and there is an assortment of lifestyle shops from carpets and furniture to indie fashion and accessories shops, and of course, dine and wine. This place can get very crowded, yes, even on weekdays. Although I wouldn't say there will be a long queue, but there will be a steady stream of people walking in. The indoor dining area fills up very quickly, so it will be best to make a reservation. They do have alfresco dining which is quite pleasant in the cool evening and if you dressed appropriately. Each time hubby and I come here, we first check out their specials for that day before looking at the menu. They usually have quite interesting stuff to offer. Always look out for what they have to offer in the steak department. Otherwise, the burgers and cod fish on the usual menu are quite awesome. We love to start off our meal with a Caesar Salad (plus grilled chicken) which we would share because the portion is quite big and we are not really big eaters. Service can be a bit on busy nights, but that does not really bother us as it is such a lovely place to sit around and observe the going-ons and have a conversation though it does get quite noisy. Overall, we love this place for its great food, attentive service and laidback vibes. Will be back for many many more dinners or lunches. Location-wise, Dempsey is centrally located, but it is a bit inconvenient to get there without a car. Taxi will be your easiest mode of transport to get there but getting out there, you may need to walk out to the main road. A short walk after dinner aids digestion!!
1
The setting for PS Cafe at Harding is excellent but mediocre food and poor service let it all down. Throw in piped jazz music droning on in the background and all the good stuff is undone. Burgers which we ordered came with additional flourishes such as a mango gloopy sauce (I think it was mango) and undercooked oven chips. Although we asked for ketchup it never came and staff frankly seemed to be very poorly Organised spending more time resetting tables than serving customers. All in all pretty average and not too cheap.

in the UK this place would be shut down for their lack of hygiene rules. i refer specifically to the harding road/dempsey branch.i ordered the eggs royale. i've had this in the ann siang hill branch and there it came with the muffin, sauce, generous helpings of avocado, spinach and smoked salmon. the one in dempsey came with ONE TINY sliver of smoked salmon on each muffin, literally a singular piece of spinach and no avocado. i thought it was a joke.many of the staff don't speak good english so it took several attempts (and people) to communicate that the avocado was MISSING, and i didn't want to pay for an additional side. no one seems to actually know the menu let alone what should be in it. they took it away. meanwhile my partner finished his meal. mine came back, with rotten avocado tossed into the salad. it's fairly hard to miss rotten avocado, seeing as it's black. unbelievable.on top of this... the chef was clearly sick. i was seated in a position that i could see him. not only was he preparing food without gloves but every 30 seconds he would take a tissue, blow his nose, dig around in his nose and toss the snotty tissue aside. he'd then tuck straight back into food preparation without washing his hands. i was honestly so unbelievably horrified at this. no one apologised for the mess up during our meal. no one offered anything as a gesture of goodwill. i'm still waiting to hear back from the manager who clearly doesn't read these reviews. several waiter staff stank of alcohol and looked hungover.our brunch cost $108 which was obscene. it looks nice but they have no standards for service or hygiene. i can't believe it's so popular. avoid at all costs. o

We went to PS Cafe after visiting Botanic Gardens.
It was on Sunday and we had to wait 40 minutes to have a table. And the waiting was ok after eat the delicious food.
We loved.

Servers were nice and warm. We got seated fast. Fantastic ambiance. Food though was just so-so. Not bad, just so-so.

I looked for other just-as-good brunch places in Singapore for a while since my first visit to the city a few years ago, but honestly PS Cafe is still the best - great food (great burger! and a great breakfast muesli... actually filling) and a GREAT green, lush location. Feels almost like you're in Bali (with a little bit of exaggeration). Great pastries and cake selection (huge cakes) for you to bring home for late afternoon munchies too. Highly recommended - I plan to go back every time I'm back in S

I am giving it 4/5 for the coffee location and the options on the menu.If I were to rate the service I would give it a 3/5. Firstly our coffee/drinks order was forgotten so I had to re-order. Secondly it seemed like a mission for the trainee waitress to bring me some water with the coffee... Usually water should be serviced when a customer orders string coffee. Other than that of you would like to eat inside the cafe you would need to be aware there is a long que (waiting period of about 30-40minutes) but you can walk around whilst your name is on the list. They also send you a text when your table is ready.

Its my 3rd year visiting singapore for Formula 1, and everytime i always drop by this place. Very quaint set up, lots of greens and trees, a breather from the "mettalic" urban jungle in the city. Food and coffee is great, well that's for my personal taste only. We go there morning of Saturday or Friday, when its still quite. Sipping coffee in the morning with that breeze and view....ambiance...what can you ask for. ...4.5 stars
5
I've been here a few times and the food is always fabulous. I ordered the burger and truffle fries the last time and I ate every last bite. If you have room for dessert, I highly recommend it. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu
5
This is one of the most beautiful and tranquil places to eat in Singapore. Their wavy burger is my favorite burger in the world. The cakes are massive and very tasty. We've been many times and never had a bad experience. It popular on weekends, so book in advance.

It was my first time to PS cafe at Dempsey Hill.The place might be hard to spot for first time comers. Not to sure how to explain the location, but keep that in mind it's quite a distance from others. I'm glad that there wasn't any queue, probably because it was over the lunch hour? It was around 2pm, weekday, just in case if you ever wonder. Initially we wanted a table outdoor but the PSI reading of that day was about 160. So i guess it might not be a good idea to enjoy my food under such weather. We had a table beside the glass window instead, and still able to enjoy the views we wanted.I ordered Chorizo quiche ($24), the taste was amazing. Enjoyed every piece of it. As for the desserts, sticky date pudding ($15) was a little too sweet for me. Don't quite like it. Same goes to the caramel toffee ($15). However, I saw plates and plates of french fries being ordered, quite tempting to try it next time. Nothing much to complain except the toilet
5
My husband and I went to PS Cafe for breakfast and it was a perfect way to start a Sunday. We got there about 10mins after they opened and were surprised at how busy it already was as you can't book a table for brunch/breakfast. We sat outside on the deck and it was a lovely peaceful morning overlooking the garden. Both our meals were on the generous size (we peeked around at other tables too and everything looked amazing) I had the toasted muesli and my husband had the eggs royale which were cooked perfectly - the coffee was also very good too. A really really lovely venue and great food to match
4
This cafe was full and bustling. Menu offers a great selection and the portions are big. Views on the garden and trees are beautiful and great for bringing kids to run around there. The coffees were of good quality and taste also. If you have space left, try some of their cakes for desert
3
The best part of this cafe is its atmosphere and setting in the forest in Dempsey Hill. We ordered beef pie and big breakfast. The taste was decent but just not surprising. The chocolate cake was a bit awful. The price was a bit high.
4
inspiring place for a culinary journey and upscale foodism experience for local and singapore tourist, great variety of menus and cocktails, great ambience, its slightly an ultimate experience for try and come back again
5
being here many times already, every time there is something new and refreshing which invites us to come back again. The food here are done to perfection. The burgers are tasty and big. The meatball are juicy and delicious. The french fries is something you should not miss. The steak sandwich was fresh and juicy as well. The desserts are great. We have tried almost every cake here, the best is chocolate fudge and vanilla ice cream which is perfect for two people. For weekends it gets really crowded so reservation is helpful.The waitresses are nice but sometimes they get a bit distracted from your table due to crowd which is understandable.
4
This cafe has a good selection of dishes and is set amongst beautiful gardens.The pasta dish I had was very tasty and my friends lamb curry was good too. Prices are reasonable at around 20 - 30 per main. Limited drinks options but good enough 
3
We visited the Dempsey Hill PS Cafe restaurant today and it was all but average. $35 cheeseburger plus $5 for the truffle fries and $34 half rack of ribs to go along with the mediocre warm bottle of $75 Shiraz. Service was lacking and they must have brought everything one at a time so there was no experience or continuity to the meal. After being in the states for the summer, you can really tell this wait staff doesn't care and there is no tip in it for them. Gluten free berry cake was nice and at $16 per slice you would hope so. Used to be one of my favourites but it is no longer. Maybe revisit before year end but doubtful.
4
PS Cafe @ Dempsey has a very nice setting amongst greenery which offers you indoor and outdoor dining. Food is ok ... I won't say exceptional .. More casual food for me. Price is ok... Not so cheap and not so expensive . Great place for catch up with friends and family.

We visited P.S. Café at Palais Renaissance on Thursday August 13th at 1:30 PM. The four of us were seated indoors in the section close to the door leading to the outdoor area. The server had shared the specials of the day after which we proceeded to order: Corn Clam ChowderSuperfood SaladBig Nihon Salad Ploughman’s Sandwich, ham replaced with turkeyPotato Gnocchi with Braised Beef The server repeated our order and got it right. First the corn clam chowder was brought out. When the chowder was finished the superfood salad, big nihon salad, and the ploughman sandwich arrived but there was no sign of the gnocchi. We found it very odd that the other 3 patrons had got their main course while the gnocchi was missing. Without any exaggeration approximately 20 minutes went by around which time the other 3 patrons had finished close to 75% of their meals. We called the server to ask whether the gnocchi was coming to which he promptly responded by saying “the gnocchi right? It is right on the way” Note, there was no apology of any kind. And he had been around serving other tables. After a further 10 minutes, there was still no sign of the gnocchi and the patrons had finished their meals. At this point in time we decided it is better to just cancel the gnocchi. The server at this point stopped coming to the section he was looking after. My wife got up from her seat and headed towards him, our server obviously noticed we were coming and dispatched another waiter to talk to us while he scurried away disappearing out of the main restaurant floor. The new waiter apologized and promptly accepted the cancellation of order however there was absolutely no explanation as to why the gnocchi was not prepared in time which left the suspicion that it was not available all along. Furthermore, the original server never returned to the main restaurant floor to personally apologize which showed the complete lack of professionalism and poor customer service. If the gnocchi was not available in the first place why confirm that it is there at the time of ordering? Why lie that it is on the way when we reconfirmed if it was not being prepared?We have been frequent visitors of the P. S. Cafe and this experience certainly left a bad taste in our mouth
4
We went to this restaurant and asked for a table outside. Was a bit disappointed about the location of the table as we were looking near the road entrance but it was still a nice setting. Our main courses were lovely. Desserts tasted pre-bought but were ok. It was quite expensive but still worth going if you want a location that's outside the busy centre
3
This visit is to the outlet at Palais Renaissance. The environment is very dark and cosy. Every main course on the menu costs at least 28 to 35. I would say that it is rather steep- for fish and chips, breaded chicken. We ordered the prawn aglio which came with 4 fresh, succulent prawns. Lovely dish , pasta done just right. The tiger beer fish & chips was rather normal. This did not stand out much. There are better fish & chips that costs less and tastes better
5
Despite its name, this is actually a very lovely restaurant tucked away amongst the greenery of the Dempsey area. Located away from the other dining clusters, its fresh flower arrangements and French windows let in natural lighting in the day and makes you feel like you dining in the garden but with shelter and comforts of air-conditioning.Food by PS never fails to impress. Love their salads and they always have something new for a change on their menu. Their desserts are equally amazing, making this a perfect spot for afternoon tea. They serve the best (if not the only) Key Lime pie in town
4
Lovely inside and great service... Pricey (like most restaurants in Singapore) but a lovely night out...
5
Went to Ps cafe at Harding road. Visit there a few times with friends and family. Staffs are friendly and helpful. Love their display with lots of fresh flowers. Food is good too but a bit costly.
4
I have seen all these mixed reviews, but myself I can only recommend it, especially for family dinners. Food is excellent and portions are generous. I've ordered a starter only (Thai shrimp salad) and I've had the rest for lunch today. It was too large to eat and way too good to leave behind. Hubby chose fish and chips, there were truly lovely. Unfortunately no space for the cakes, but next time I'll visit super hungry. The drinks then : pricey, even for Norwegian but very good. Try the white bouquet sangria, or Frangelico martini;)Service: kind, attentive but too many people waiting and trying to be helpful . That results in a messy impression of who-when-messed up the order. Definitely room for improvement
4
PS Cafe holds a special place in my life and so I frequent it at various times of the day and year. I love many things about the cafe - it's location, ambience, decor, menu and variety and also it's desserts. Even it's bathroom are good.On a most recent with friends, I tried the Green Goddess Pasta and that was delicious, too. However, I do think that there is a certain air of arrogance amongst the service staff. Hope they work on this.Meanwhile, try their Mojitos, the Truffle Fries, the Moroccan Stack, Melted cheese toasties, the Green Goddess pasta and the desserts
4
Very popular when I went, for weekend brunch. Had to wait a while for an outdoor table, but it was worth it just for the atmosphere. Food quality was on par with the price (both slightly above average Singapore-standard). There was a huge downpour in the middle of our meal, so we had to rush inside - the management is obviously smart because there were just enough tables for all the outdoor diners to take one inside, despite that there was a wait for arriving customers
3
Went for Sunday brunch and the outside seating was full with young families. Reception was prompt and the staff sat us near the full height glass windows. So busy that they did not even clean our table after the last client but service speed was OK. Rather too many kids running in and out of air-con glass house that the ambience was noisy and busy, not so good for a chat with friends.I was disappointed with the taste of the egg benedict and their signature big breakfast turned out to be quite small! The sausages were tasteless and stringy so I doubt the quality of ingredients were that good. Overall, it was not a good experience and I believe there is better value for money elsewhere on Demsey Hill. (we also went to Jones
4
Bought a family friend from overseas here for dinner and she loved it! The staff were warm and friendly and were very attentive to our needs.Since I had my baby girl with me, the staff suggested for the chef to whip up some spaghetti (not in the menu) for her. Talk about being regardful!The cakes looked so appetizing, that we just had to have 1 take-away as we were too full that night. Great plac
4
Went to the outlet in the building next to the thai embassy on orchard roadThe coffee and desserts were niceIt's environment is very relaxed and good place to hang with friendsThe portions for the food is large and one main course and perhaps one dessert should be shared between two
1
Barely greeted upon arrival for a reservation at lunch, I waited 15 minutes after being seated for someone to take my order. No one came, so I flagged someone down. Food delivered unceremoniously. Not once did someone check on me, or fill my empty glass of water. Plate removed, and sat here for another 10 minutes before flagging someone down to bring the bill. And they have the gall to add a 10% service charge.This was the location in Dempsey Hill. Good food, but the service negates that.
5
Very crowded on a weekend brunch. The poach eggs were the favorite dish we had. Service was pretty efficient and mostly good except for a trainee. A bit pricy but worth it for the occasion. Again recommended by friends. Will definitely be back again with friends
2
It changed a lot. Less staff. Automated entrance ticketing. Portions are muuuuuuuuuuuuch smaller. But still one of the nicest hangouts in the jungle in the middle of singapore.
5
As this was the last meal we had in Singapore we wanted a nice meal to send us on our way. We spent about 25 min wandering around until we finally stumbled upon this place. I apologize in advance I would not know how to direct someone here, but I think it is in the general vicinity of the strip of bars near Chinatown..We noticed the décor was very nice so I was immediately drawn to it. Who doesn't want to eat in a place that has nice vibes? Not I. Anyway, there is a sign on the door that says it is not open for children, so keep this place in mind for business lunches, and or dates. Either than that the food was splendid, I asked for a recommendation and ended up choosing the steak sandwich, WHICH was excellent. I also ordered a side of spinach as this was the first time I came across my favorite vegetable in SEA. My friend ordered the lamb special which I had the pleasure of watching her devour and practically lick the plate clean. If we would have found it earlier in our visit we might have also tried some of their dessert and special french fries, by the look and smell of them seemed amazing. The staff on our visit were exceptional as they let us dine on a table that was reserved later that evening. I know from personal experience they do not have to do this. So don't forget to make a reservation to ensure a spot, and check out their specials. All in all, if you can find this place, have a little money saved to spend on a dinner that is well worth it, then I advise you to visit here
3
Everything just missed the spot today. Service a little erratic, chicken Caesar salad a bit soggy, surroundings a bit crowded and functional looking, bill a bit pricey. Not the best PS cafe (the one off Orchard is better). Not bad, but just missed the mark on several levels. Fortunately, great company :
5
Great coffi w lox benedict albeit a bit understaffed this Easter Sunday though I wasn't in any hurry- hike it upstairs and settle in - you'll like it - even the sound track was divine (Opera actually and neighboring table were scarfing down pancakes under faintly muffled appreciative exclamations
3
I go to PS Cafe once in a while as my friends and I have set this as our annual reunion place. The cafe has a nice interior and laid-back ambience so we feel comfortable to have long lunch/ dinner followed by coffee and tea. The food is average but pricey though, but I feel it is still worth it
1
Went there for the first time on a sunday to the PS Cafe at Harding road. It took my husband a very long time to catch the attention of a staff.He waved for a very long time and a trainee saw it but did not come immediately. Another waiter went to her and told her to serve us. She discussed/chatting happily with him before finally coming to our table.Her attitude sucked! She did not even bother to ask us how we would like the eggs to be done. We also ordered black coffee and she rudely asked "which one".Last straw was when she returned and literally flip 2 paper coasters on our table, rudely ofcourse(what else!).So this time I waved to catch the attention of another waiter. He again signaled that trainee over to us.I told her we were cancelling our orders. She just gave a short laugh and said "OK".What kind of service is that????This will be the first and the last time we will ever patronise PS Cafe
4
On our last night in Singapore, we ventured out to Dempsey Hill and had dinner at P.S. Cafe. We got seated outdoors in the patio and the weather was perfect. The truffle fries were addicting but I mostly enjoyed the bolognese than the burger (my friend and I shared each other's entrees). We also made sure to save room for dessert. I'm not a big fan of banana cake, but let me tell you, the banana cake was to die for![TIP] They will call a cab for you
4
My first time in PS Cafe, I went with my boyfriend and a couple of friends to the Harding Road outlet.Very nice ambiance outside, very green and homey. It was full on a Saturday afternoon with both family and younger crowd, good thing we were seated immediately.We had a bottle of wine for four, their famous Truffle Fries and I had a large size Croque Madame. For me, the food is nothing special, I think this place is good for the chill ambiance. Dempsey Hill is a nice area, a bit away from the city. We enjoyed our afternoon
1
A great environment, a good cuisine but probably the WORST restaurant in Singapore regarding the queue management and client service. We were waiting for more than 30 minutes to get a table while they have 6 empty tables and whole section closed for people to wait. But if they were using all these empty tables and the closed section there will be no queue at all and clients would have been happy!The PS Cafe Dempsey has for sure the WORST client service in Singapore and South East Asia. As it it is not the first time we notice such a high level of inefficiency there, it is obvious the manager nor the owner come to the place on weekend. And now that they set up a queue device to run the queue, there is no human welcome... Just hope the owner will read this revue so he can see what is the reality and evaluate how much more money he could make with a proper management team 
4
We had heard lots of good things on PS Café and went there (the original? outlet in Harding Road/Dempsey Hill) on a Sunday for brunch. Arriving at around 10:30 a.m., we still could choose between inside and outside tables and opted for the latter. When we left around noon, there already were 4 to 5 parties queuing for a table - no reservations are taken for brunch, so you may want to have your taxi waiting while you check for availability.The atmosphere on the terrace is really nice and relaxed. Some trees and lots of green around means exchanging CBD's concrete jungle with the original thing for a change; music and all fitting to chill and relax on a sunny Singapore Sunday morning.For brunch, there is a selection of meals available to order, most notably a "Big Breakfast platter" (S$26++) and Eggs Benedictine or Florentine (S$25++), what we had. The breakfast platter features 2 eggs to choice, tomato, bacon, beans, toast and sausage. We upgraded the latter to Chorizo sausage, but, to be frank, did not recognize it as something we'd know from Europe and choose not to investigate further into it... The rest of the food, however, was good and to our liking.If you accompany your breakfast with a tea and a juice (nice concoctions there) each, your bill will add up to something like S$100 for two.Your Sunday diet requires some chocovitamins? Then go for the double chocolate cake, served with chocolate sauce (though accompanied, strangely, by vanilla and not chocolate ice cream...). Be warned, though: it's not only dangerously close to death-by-chocolate considering the ingredients, but also the size, as one slice could easily feed a small family
4
Great food, with beautiful outdoor sitting arrangement. Good service. Its a pub/bar/restro that serves good food with large portion sizes. The double chocolate cake is something to look out for ( It is difficult to gorge at one go though :) ).
4
Tired from shopping, we took a short break here and ordered the truffle fries. Was good. We enjoyed the ambience. Service was good.
3
We've been here a few times and each time I feel like it is a wonderful venue with nice grounds but the service and food is average. Worth a visit for the ambience but there is better food around
3
The venue is fantastic. We went to the branch in Dempsey Hill. The ambiance is perfect. Service was very good. The staff was prompt and attentive. The food is just average. Too pricey for me I think. What I don't like was the toilet. It was filthy. They need to check it from time to time to see if it's clean
2
The one in Dempsey is very good atmosphere and lots of space. However, the food and drinks are far too expensive and not worth it! In our group we tried 3 different slices of cakes at $15 per slice! None of them were anything special. In fact not even worth half that price! A slice of chocolate and banana cheesecake at $15 was a complete waste of money! Not tasty at all! Their mains are very expensive - my prawn pasta was $27! Their drinks are expensive too.I would not recommend this place as overpriced and the food is not worth it but the atmosphere is very good and the service was very good
3
Nice place, really liked it. My first visit. However, I ordered the sticky glazed grilled prawns with glass noodle salad. I got 3 not-sticky, not-glazed shrimps and hardly any noodles. When I asked the waiter, he said: That 's just how it is. Pity! My last visit
2
I brought my family of six to PS Cafe' on Hard Road in Dempsey Village on Saturday February 7, 2015. We were greeted very nicely and "logged in", got out # and waited 40 minutes for a table which were the expectations set by the host when we first arrived. We noticed several tables that were un-bused with dirty dishes that stayed that way for quite a while. We ordered our food and drinks. Drinks arrived quickly and the food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. Despite other reviews, we found the food good/average, but certainly not outstanding. The prices at PS Cafe are fairly ridiculous.... SGD$14 for a slice of pie....SGD$27 for spaghetti Bolognese...seriously? However, the glacial service which required several rounds of arm-waving on our part to get the staff's attention was only eclipsed by the dirtiness. There was a cooked carrot under our table....no problem...it happens...but when I bent down to pick it up with a napkin, I noticed there was a considerable amount of food matter under the table, some of it quite old...disgusting. The sliding door track next to us had a significant amount of dirt accumulated. The view outside the window we were seated next to was of a pile of their old, broken furniture, looking like it had been stacked there for many months when it should have been discarded or stored out of view. As is the Singapore standard, an extra 10% was placed on the bill for the slow service we received.....not that the restaurant gives any of it to the staff (we asked). For the prices that PS Cafe' charges, they are well off the standard of service and cleanliness they should be delivering to their customers
4
Go to Dempsey when youy are tired of the roaring noice of Singapore centre; it is unbelievable to find a lovely quiet spot so close to the center of town. An old military terrain converted into a center for restaurants and bars to everybody's taste. PS Cafe was one of the first to set up there about 8 years ago and they picked one of the best spots; the ambieance is perfect. Outside sitting nearly under the trees, good music and friendly service. The food is nothing to get exited about but good enough to make the total into an enjoyable visit. Make sure you book it is often full, certainly for dinner
4
I have never had a full meal here but I always make a visit for dessert or tea. I also love their truffle fries. I agree that they are slightly overrated but nonetheless they are good. I recently tried their sticky date pudding which was excellent and their Moroccan mint tea which was also good. I prefer visiting in the afternoon as the area offers a peaceful ambiance with many surrounding trees and greenery
4
I went to the outlet at Palais Renaissance for lunch and I was very impressed buy the ambiance and decor. Very retro circa 1960's Singapore in the nostalgic black and white theme that was prevalent at the time. Very chic with indoor and outdoor seating available. Service was excellent as was the food.Try the Tandoori Club Sandwich and the Crab Tart. The White Sangria was superb. Will definitely go back again the next time I'm back in Singapore. However, next time I will try their main outlet for dinner. Well done - they've got it righ
5
Lovely ambience with good amount if variety. Tried the beef stew and was great. $30 and above for mains. Situated a lil 50 mtrs away from the other restaurants in Dempsey hill. Recommended!!
4
We were a group of six members of family and friends & went on Christmas day for sweet dishes.
We had cakes which were very delicious. The chocolate cake was out of this world.
Certainly a place to return to in future.
2
A simple cod was $39 before tax, about $20+ for simple green salad. And this would be OK if it was great food, but it was only average... Maybe a bit below. Ambience was OK... Service was hit and miss.
5
I've visited Ps Cafe at Dempsy Hill many times and there is always something to keep me coming back. Their portions are huge with a regularly updated menu. My most regular meal is the steak sandwich which I can say, is one of my favourite steak sandwiches from all that I have tasted across the world. It's pure pleasure every time I eat it!Ps Cafe offers a wide range of drinks and I sometimes opt for the strawberry milk shake which is equally satisfying (however is a bit filling). They have a wide range of desserts, one of my favourites is the chocolate cake (you can take the desserts home if you are too full up!)Yes, Ps cafe may seem expensive compared to other options, yet I think it's totally worth it, and it is worth paying for something that is worth it.One issue I have found is that the service sometimes is hit and miss, however I don't think this affects the overal quaility meal as much as it could, as the food and ambience is spot on
5
We reserved a table for lunch, I think this is a must as it seems busy. We strolled over after visiting the botanical gardens. The truffle chips are too die for with a nicely chilled beer. Food was really nice and reasonably priced, the waiters always seemed busy so a short wait on occasions but nothing to bad and it was fully booked. Would retur

This place is wonderful for what it is: a casual place to meet for western brunch on the weekends. The backyard is beautiful and the coffee and drinks are good. The truffle fries are enormous and a big hit with everyone (although see below). We come here 1x a month for brunch. The prices are high, but that is just singapore, and for Singapore the prices are not unreasonable. The food is a little hit or miss - some dishes are better than others and some days are better than others. The first two times we had very good food, the last two times it was good, but not great. Go for the atmosphere and enjoy what it is, and if the food is also good then you've caught them on a good day!Specific recommendations on food quality to PS Cafe: we noticed the truffle fries the last time or so were very oily and soft, which says to me that your frying oil is too cool. Also, the truffle oil and cheese seemed more sparingly applied than before. I would rather have fewer fries and more truffle!Additionally I would recommend making the big breakfast slightly bigger, possibly with slightly more baked beans or mushrooms or grilled tomato half. Finally, the bread products are a little on the soft and white side. I know this is Asia but slightly better quality hamburger buns and English muffins make a big difference
4
Had lunch here with 3 others and found the menu a bit on the thin side. But my Chargrilled Portobello Salad that came was surprisingly delicious and I wolfed it down despite not being hungry (due to a large hotel breakfast). The other dishes were also excellent - like all self-proclaimed foodies we tried each other's dishes. The portions were generous but not American (wasteful)-size. So everyone finished their plates satisfied. Atmosphere was great; busy, casual, but not market-like noisy. Service was generally fast so no complaints there. The bill was a bit of a shocker, though. 4 dishes (no steaks), 4 drinks came up to be S$135++. It was really delicious but also too expensive
5
We have been to this restaurant several times and every time had a fantastic meal. The ambience is excellent, the service is friendly and the food can't be faulted! They change the menu every few months and everything we've had we have throughly enjoyed. Our favourite restaurant in Singapore.
5
Where heritage meets modernity! Was taken to this place by a friend and really lived it. We have been spending the night at the roof top sipping yummie drinks made by really professional bar tenders. Since there was a party going on we kept socialising with other guests. Really enjoyed it there and would definitely go back! Don't forget to see the skyline view from the terrace.

I really have to give credit to the decor of all their outlets - dim, intimate, mysterious and lovely. It always gives a relaxing and romantic vibe, no matter which outlet, at which time of the day, and with whom.Tonight *Joseph the friend and I shared a Sticky Date Pudding (SGD$12.90) - the one food item I was finally impressed by. The vanilla ice-cream was a plus point, but the sweet and sticky dessert itself was delicious. It was sweet but not toothache-inducing, and the date (fig?) flavor was strongly distinctive, giving the pastry a very lovely taste. The lemon custard sauce added a twist to the flavor.I also had Rose and Berries Sangria (SGD$18.00) - frozen seasonal berries, rose buds and lemon wedges infused in rose wine with a dash of lemon soda - making this an utterly refreshing and tantalising drink. I love the combination simply, and the sweetness of it all was very soothing, perfect ladies' kind of drinks.For full review and more photographs, please feel free to visit:http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/11/drinks-at-ps-cafe-dempsey-hill.htm

Happy with the truffle fries and the ambiance.
Perfect for wedding and family celebrations....
see you next week

I had a relaxing evening with my girl friends gossping over great cheese cake at PS cafe. The hero dessert - banana cheese cake is so light but yet fulfilling that you cannot miss！ great ambience and very relaxing atmosphere.

Had fond memories of last visit and weren't disappointed. Went on a sunday and as cant make bookings it can be a bit of a long wait but worth it as food always good. Everyone is patient. Service is good. Always recommend.

Went back to this cafe again, revued it last year , still good food not too expensive , it's in Paragon . A lot of the cafes and restaurants do not have a location that is clear just a street or area and if you haven't got a map it's hard

I was highly recommended to come to this cafe by a friend. Arrived here on Sunday (2/11) at 340pm and asked the front desk Marvin if we could have a seat for three upstairs. He just replied that there was no seat upstairs, just at the bar area. We said how long was the wait? And he said its indefinite as he just sat a large party. Aa we'd already walked a long way we decided we'd stay here. So we grudgingly took a seat, and took a walk upstairs to have a look at the cakes and we saw so many empty tables! In fact at that very moment a party of 4 left and we had to rush to ask if we could get that table. When we asked the server upstairs if we could have the table he said "perhaps" it was already taken by someone else. But we told the server we'd already had a seat downstairs and there was no one waiting in line (they didn't even offer to check!). We then took the initiative to run back downstairs and looked for Marvin who then simply said: Go back upstairs in 5 minutes. No apology, no semblance of I'm sorry i should have checked for a seat for you upstairs whatsoever and no offer of saying I'll bring you up when the table upstairs is ready. So after waiting for 5 minutes we walked upstairs by ourselves and showed ourselves to our table. On the way up we were stopped by Marvin and were disciplined: You have to order a drink or a dish per person! And then we went upstairs. This is terrible, we felt discriminated and looked down upon. Enough said, my entire Sunday afternoon was spoilt and I'm sitting here still waiting for my order to be taken.

One of my favorite places in Singapore great for all meals. Reservations recommended as always packed. By far the best truffle fries on the island. Desserts are enormous and recommended to share. Great menu, super service and food is well prepared and very nice. Bring your family or have a working lunch, bring guests for dinner. Can really recommened this plac

It's one great place to spend a few hours of your weekend with friends. I have only been there twice but those times were really amazing. The food was excellent! The environment of the restaurant is very relaxing and suitable for customers of all ages. The glass walls added to the beauty of the place as you feel closer to nature. Having said all these, what makes me want to go back there again are the staff who have been very attentive and friendly throughout the course of our meals. In particular, Mr. Jeffrey Leyran really impressed me and my friends. He was very detailed and knew exactly how to delight us, his customers. He is truly a service professional! To the management and staff of PS Cafe Harding Road, I am so looking forward to my next meal there!
5
A place where u can indulge yourself and your friends when you are having sweettooth attack, their cakes and puddings are simply the best! The truffle fries and salads shared with friends over laughter and fun, Jeffrey Leyran, the Manager never seize to amaze us on every occassion., he would come and check if were ok and if we need anything which is beyond top service. This the place I would love to keep coming back
5
I can't recall how many times we've dine here, all I can say is that food is great and portion is BIG! There are plenty of resto in the area but what keeps us coming back here (besides the food and cake) is the ambiance...it is cozy, welcoming and warm. the aesthetic is one part, but what really makes the ambiance great is the service! I clearly remember, Jeffrey (who regularly serves us), remembers my name on my second visit. His service is impeccable and tremendous effort when he deals with us - believe me, we are very difficult to serve! Very helpful and this goes to the rest of the team, well done Jeffrey and PS Cafe team, two thumbs up

It's a relief to find this cafe..
Despite the proximity with the closest public transport and the difficulty to find cab around this area..
In total it's good..
Glad to know this place is here..
The concept of re-using the old barn/storage is pretty amusing!

Well, It's been 8 years since I lived in Singapore. So many places for brunch over the weekend which I think at least half of them are over rated. I had a doubt to stop by at PS Cafe here... cause often it cost more than Fourseasons Breakfast. Well, at least for this time, it was a good choice. We enjoyed very much. They know how to serve champagne and wine. Will I come back? Yes. Fy tip, it's easier to get a table for four than two. We got a table for four within 5 mins whereas others waited forever.
5
This is a great place if you are having lunch or dinner with friends. I had the baby back ribs this time instead of the usual truffle fries and burger or sandwich. It melts in your mouth and it is perfectly seasoned. I never thought that they were that good! Next time you visit this place do try it out! Their desserts are also fantastic so if you are watching your diet this is not the place for you

We are regular customers of PS CafÃ© Dempsey and make a point also to visit every time we have guests in town. Very disappointed by today's service and food. Service started well and went "down the drain" in no time. Disinterested, shovelling menu card right in your face, carelessly placing plates on the table, food mediocre. My fish was still pink, untimely delivery of food (2 served, 1 not). Guys, get your act together and invest a bit in staff training. Live out foul mood somewhere else. Remember, guests are paying your salary
5
I have been hearing of this place for quite some time now but I haven't got the chance to go until recently.The service is impeccable, I must say that it is not easy for 8 odd people to work the whole place which I see can fill about 150 people. These people are amazing! Great food and the ambience is one to remember.Will return
4
The food was good though I think still a little pricey even if it is in Dempsey. Service was good but not great. Cakes and desserts are definitely good. We were having dinner this time but I came here for breakfast previously and was a little disappointed
3
When I go to restaurants, I'm always keen on the Specials. So I have chosen their Specials a couple of times and they are a miss. We went there sometime Christmas and it was just a couple of ham slices piled up with a very salty sauce. We all had the same thing and they came looking different from one another with different serving sizes.So lesson learned -- stick to their basics -- Ceasar Salad, Truffle Fries, Eggs Benedict...Service also becomes bad when they are full -- so avoid weekends
3
The restaurant itself is fine with a lovely outlook and aspect, there is outdoor and indoor seating. There were plenty of staff on duty but they appeared to lack training and good management. At times I had to physically get out of my seat and flag them down as they came past our table because they did not make eye contact or show any concern for the dinners other than to take the initial order and deliver the food. I am sure that this could easily be resolved but it really detracts from what should be an enjoyable experience which you are paying good money for
2
It's not just the food that makes a restaurant - and this PS Cafe is a case in point. Difficult to make a booking as you have to text and wait for a text reply - but we got a table. We should have got the not welcome message as soon as we walked in - no one came from behind the bar to greet us, in fact we were plainly ignored until we asked to be shown to a table. Then we had to ask for water, menus and call the waiter back to place an order - at no time did a single staff member approach us to check on anything. Everyone who was sat outside had to search for staff who all seemed to be hiding inside. The waiter managed to take the order almost in complete silence - "medium or well" seemed to be the extent of his vocabulary. Water glasses not refilled, four people = four napkins (even though we had finger food), and then the overall bills was almost $180 for four burgers and three drinks. (service charge included but not any service!)As we left the staff we downright rude - jokey "come back soon" and "byeee" - we were glad to leave and won't be returning.It's really more than just poor customer service, this was simply ignorant, unfriendly, rude behaviour from everyone we had the misfortune to encounter.Horrid evening

Located in a very greenery area which can provide a quiet ambiance. It's a very good place if you wanna chill a bit after work. There are indoor and outdoor seats to choose from and there are threes outside. I only had a chance to have a coffee break with friends but would like to come back again because its a great place either to hang out with friends or be alone. It is not easy to be located even my friends has came here for several times because they don't have a very obvious signboard and blocks look very similar so you better make sure you have the address unless you assure you would be able to find it. Service quality has a lot to be improved.
5
We arrived around 9.30am on a Sunday morning and had a choice of tables on the terrace. Lovely green location, spacious outdoor space with fans and ceiling fans. Excellent food and they were very accommodating of allergies. Very good coffee. We will be back!
4
If this restaurant is the one at Dempsey - then it is my favorite PS Cafe! Love to have dinner there with my family or friends. Like the food though rather pricey. Can't say that much about service but ok. Love the atmosphere especially dining outdoor. Too noisy indoor
2
We have visited the place 2 times, and will not return due to the service.First time we arrived and took a table, service was just Ok not very friendly, but the place was nice, so we went a second time.Second time we were waiting for 20 min with noone paying attention to us, when we finally requested the menu, a waiter told us in a bad way, that there was a queue and that we had to wait. Nothing wrong with having a queue or waiting, but the general attitude of the service team is totally wrong and inapropiate. If you have had the same experience, please leave your comments about the service, I am sure other clients will appreciate it, and so should the owners

For full review & photos, please visit:http://summerlovestoeat.blogspot.sg/2014/08/ps-cafe-28b-harding-road-singapore.htmlThe food here was not bad with huge portion but at steep prices. You can dine at hotel ambience with such prices actually. The ambience here was very noisy type. Service was quite bad. If the host is not at the counter upon your arrival, you have to stand there to wait till the host comes back even though the server staff saw you. The server staff will only come and usher you to a table if the host is still not back after some time. We waited for about 8 mins standing there though there were so many empty tables at that time. I find this service very stupid actually. The staff were all very busy at most of the time during weekend brunch so the attitude on some staff was not very good while some was really nice.Overall rating is average due to the poor service

Been to PS cafe at Palais several times and always knew that their food aren't the best. Regardless, I still enjoyed it generally because of the ambience and location. However, last week, I went there with a few friends and am greatly disappointed at the food, level of service and cleaniness. Here is the breakdown: (A) cleanliness  I ordered a ginger tea and the cup that was served is terrible dirty, with yellow stains surrounding the inner part of the cup, though the outside looks perfectly white and clean. (B) service I requested for a tea spoon and it took them more than 15 mins to get a teaspoon and by then my tea is cold. (FYI - I had to speak to 3 different personnel for the same request)(C) FoodDisappointment came again when we were introduced to a new dish - pumpkin bread with bacon and bananas with caramel.  The new invention is not tasty at all. The bread is too dense and tasteless. Even with the sauce, it's not good enough to bring out the taste of pumpkin bread. Anyways, while we finished our food, the waitress kindly asked us on the feedback for the new dish (pumpkin bread) and thinking that it's a sincere question asking for feedback, I provided my honest feedback saying it's not good and it's quite tasteless.  The waitress, ignored me and quickly kept the dirty plates and walked away. I am taken back by such reaction and wonder if ps cafe is really concern of it's quality of food and sincere in taking in feedback to achieve a even better standard. Anyways, the place is always crowded, and with such slow service and average food standard, maybe you are better off trying out other cafes in Singapore

Though short, the (fusion) menu and the white wine selection please. Service can be more prompt (I ate twice in a five-day period) but it is friendly when given. Casual setting (in Dempsey Hill) with a nice garden view, making it a great place to meet up with friends. Mid-priced (quite reasonable). My personal favorites are the Miso Cod and Spicy Prawn Aglio Olio. Among the dessert offerings I have tried (about six), the sticky date pudding with toffee sauce is tops.Tips: 1. The restaurant is popular so remember to make reservations. 2. The Sunday brunch on cool mornings is worth a try. 3. After your meal, take a walk uphill and window shop (Rouge or La Prendo) or pick up grocery items from Jones the Grocer. 3. The branch in Palais Renaissance (2F) along Orchard Road has a longer menu and is better appointed
5
PS cafe was always one of my favourite places to eat when I lived in Singapore and that hasn't changed since moving back to the UK. I visit Singapore regularly and I don't consider my stay complete until I've spent an evening at PS Cafe. The atmosphere is relaxed, the decor gorgeous and the food is tasty and non pretentious with generous portion sizes. I'm aware of the fact that it's not cheap here but I strongly believe those extra few dollars spent are 100% worth it. If you want to impress a date or celebrate a special occasion I would thoroughly recommend this place
4
In very busy Singapore, it is hard to find a place with a few of the trees and grass away from all the noise. PS Cafe is just that even though it's right in the middle of all the stuff on Dempsey Road. I only had drinks there and they were pricey. So my review is only about the ambience of the place. It is fairly expensive... 16 SGD for a small glass of average wine is high. But if you consider the tranquility, it just might be worth it
4
Since Dempsey Hill was converted into an eating and dining destination, the place has exploded into a popular hangout, especially on weekends.Came for lunch with friends and managed to get a table even though we did not have a reservation. Must add that the place filled up very rapidly after that, considering it was a weekday.Ended up ordering their (presumably) signature PS Burger, especially since we noticed a number of folks having it too ... so must be good right?Yup, the wagyu burger was really outstanding, although a but a bit pricy.They do have a good selection of desserts too
4
I had brunch with friends at PS cafe. Food is vey good, but is a bit pricy (30$++ for a burger, other meals min. 25$++, no alcoholic drinks, 9.5$, etc.), service is ok. The burger was great ! We asked for a seat on the terrace - was great atmosphere, quiet and in the shade. The only problem can be the time you have to wait before getting a table, a the price, which makes it a "from time to time" place to have brunch.Nevertheless, I think we will come back 
5
We ate here with friends. The food is absolutely gorgeous - highly recommend the miso cod and Parmesan and truffle fries. The cakes are amazing and the portions really generous - definitely big enough to share. The atmosphere was great - busy and fun. Recommend.
4
Super vibrant atmosphere and buzzing with ladies and lads who like to lunch. Food was good but a bit pricey for what it was.
4
This is a nice spot for brunch in a fun area. Enjoyed the outdoor area with the nice garden. Food was decent and good for brunch. Fun place for friends or just enjoying a lazy Sunday morning.
4
Been long since last went there. The green surrounding is superb and service is good.
Had breakfast which quality is ok except the double chic cake which was way too sweet as too much choc sauce.
Price is on the high side.

Perfect place to meet up with friends in a nice ambiance within a beautiful location. Overlooking a small plot of the Dempsey "forest", P.S. Cafe offers a mood to cosy up with loved ones or to catch up with friends. I was bringing a friend out for dinner and desserts as she was visiting from Indonesia - being an interior designer, she was keen to discover places in Singapore with stunning designs; and P.S. Cafe is definitely one.Each main would set you back by about SGD 30-40, and each dessert is around SGD 16 after taxes and service charge. Try the pecan pie and key lime pie, these were amazing. And my chocolate-fan of a friend swears by the knockout triple chocolate cake. In my opinion, the desserts here are more worth your time and stomach space.With prices and in a setting like that, you would expect a decent level of service, however this is where P.S. Cafe disappoints with what I would sadly describe as lackluster service. It was almost impossible to get our orders and took us 3 tries speaking with the waiting staff before we were served the condiments with our food. The only time they approached our table was to give us the bill - when we didn't even call for it, and to inform us that we needed to leave in 10 minutes as it was closing time soon. Just one notification and we had to leave at that. I believe most places would inform you when the "kitchen is closing" and also take that chance to remind you of their closing hours. We never got that alert, so having to cut short our conversation left a bitter note to our otherwise very enjoyable night out.All in all, it's a beautiful location and a beautiful restaurant. Would I return? Perhaps, but only if I'm bringing guests out, or if i'm absolutely craving for a plate of pecan pie

A couple of friends and I headed to PS Cafe on the Monday night of a long weekend. We did not have an reservation, but they were able to seat us after a short wait. We started with a combo of wind and cocktails, which were fine.The service was fairly good, although we had to flag down a waiter whenever we needed further service. We went straight for main courses, with a combination of the salmon salad, cod and prawn pasta. The food came quite quickly, although there was a gap before the last dish turned up. I had the fish, which was particularly disappointing, being overcooked, under seasoned and generally lacking in flavour. The salad was slightly better and the reports on the pasta were good.Dessert was a shared pineapple meringue pie, which again was pretty average and a weird consistency.PS Cafe was certainly not a bad meal, but for the premium price point, we certainly expected a more polished experience
4
Four of us celebrated our family reunion at this upmarket cafe. Dishes included my two entrees (Crispy Calamari and Cod Pate Rillettes) and three mains; Miso Cod, and two Basil Prawn Laksas. Great food, in the best Singapore tradition... . Service was friendly and efficient. Beer prices were comparatively reasonable. Wine prices were high, even given Singapore taxes... and we saw no-one drinking wine in the restaurant.Reasonable prices for entrees (starters) and mains, but international travellers should note that a service charge (10%) and GST (7%) will be added to your bill
4
Our friend brought us to this cafe when we were in Singapore last weekend and we absolutely love it! It was in a nice area with beautiful trees and greenery. The cafe was surrounded by full length glass windows and you could enjoy the view while having your meal. The desserts were awesome and of huge portion too so just make sure that you don't over order
3
Ok, the setting is pretty cool. Nestled in a lush and leafy nook on Dempsey Hill with lots of glass walls to look out to the greenery. It's like a cafe in a glasshouse.Atmosphere. Ok, that's here too. Buzzy, lots of people coming and going. A mix of couples, families and groups of friends.The food? About average. The service, also about average. And the menu lacks imagination.....but it's a much-talked-about place so give it a try and make your own mind up...

I went to P.S Cafe on the 4th of June with some friends and as soon as we entered the building there was a horrible urine smell coming from the toilets on the inside where people were eating their lunch! I was thankful that we were sitting outside as we didn't smell the bathrooms. P.S Cafe is an expensive place to have lunch or dinner and for the price that customers are paying they shouldn't have to smell urine coming from the bathrooms! This has been an ongoing issue for going to PS Cafe, as a couple months ago I went to the place and there was the smell of urine coming from the bathrooms again to I'm surprised and shocked to see that P.S Cafe have not sorted this issue out!

food - normal breakie stuff
surroundings - nice and lively - you pay for this
servers - normal, nothing fantastic
price - slightly high for bread / eggs / processed meat
people - mainly expats (they get served better though)
3
Ridiculously expensive. Good portions, good menu selections, helpful staff. Overall, we had a pleasant experience.
We had egg florentine which was decent. My drink was replaced when an insect accidentally fell to it.
I may visit again, but will reserve it for special occasions.
1
Kids r people,too, and you can earn a lot from therm, and their parents! Not that the food offering or is high end. Just a cafe after all!
4
Great location, excellent food particularly the cakes and stylish decor. The burgers and Georgia Rueben sandwich are very tasty.
2
One would expect basic hygiene to be maintained at a so called fancy restaurant - they are charging us for that after all. We just happened to wipe the wet table with a white tissue and guess what when we looked at the tissue it had turned brown with the DUST accumulated on table. What a let down! The worse was even when we shared this with the staff they didn't even attempt cleaning the table or saying sorry. I wish I could attach a picture of the tissue paper to make you guys belief.

Was invited for lunch here by a business contact. Never been to this area of singapore before but it was very nice and peaceful. The cafe is set a bit back on the block in a nice and lush garden environment.Food was great (I had the burgundy pie) and you really should try their juices, they are also very very good.Food came fast and service was good too.Will be coming back her

We were invited to PS Cafe and I was underwhelmed by the menu, which I peeked at online as I don't eat red meat or dairy these days...and making a reservation proved difficult as it was a holiday weekend. However, when we arrived we were shown a nice outside table, and i sampled a passionfruit martini (tasty) while waiting for our friends...well, we waited and waited and after 45 minutes we ordered. We shared a starter of soft shell crab and avocado which was crispy, light and delicious, ample for two. Then we both had the miso cod, which flaked just the way fresh cod should, although it didn't seem to have too much miso on it, but it was nevertheless very good. Service was attentive and we were pleasantly surprised by the gift of a slab of gift wrapped ginger and walnut cake to make up for our disappearing dinner dates! Eating out in Singapore is never cheap - hawker centres aside -and I would say this is average pricing for Dempsey. But at least you get quality for your money here
1
I feel that PS Cafe service standards have dropped terribly. Unfortunately, I was looking at dining at this good restaurant but wasn't even able to even begin dining there because I had over the period of 4 hours tried to call to reserve a space, seeing as to how packed it usually is, but no one picks up either the handphone or main line throughout this horrendous period. I feel that this reflects extremely poorly on the PS cafe chain in general and am seriously reconsidering going to any of the outlets any longer, because it seems that high prices do not translate into better service
4
The size or the servings are very big here, which softens the blow of the prices. It's also not easy to get to unless you have a car or use a taxi. The service was so-so, nothing to write home about. It was a nice dining experience but there is a lot of good food in Singapore so not sure it is a stand out eatery.
5
This is one of the best brunches I've had in Singapore. I loved the setting and ambiance, and we didn't have to wait long for a table even on a Saturday. The food was all delicious. We shared the blueberry pancakes, which were perfect, as well as the quiche (delicious) and the chicken parmesan (not particularly memorable). My friend's corn beef hash was also great. Great coffee and juices. Didn't try any, but the pastries looked excellent... We took our time and really enjoyed the meal, didn't feel rushed. Service is nonexistent, but that's to be expected. I would happily return
4
Very nice place and the atmosphere in here is good!

Not many good restaurants at Dempsey hill. As compared to others, this is a better one. That's why always long queue. Service average.
5
The pros:- Service was pretty good for a busy Sunday. I was shown a table immediately and offered a menu by the friendly waiter.- Order taken, water brought to table in minutes. Water was pretty tasty and good temperature- not icy cold, but not lukewarm.- One of the best breakfasts I've ever had- I had the big breakfast, hearty and not too big. Scrambled eggs were fluffy, good veges, the carraway toast was a taste sensation.- Coffee excellent- very strong.- Check out their bags in teh attached Project Shop - very cool.No cons, other than I agreed with the comments below; a tad overpriced, but makes up for it with excellent coffee and food. Will go again
4
Absolutely awesome place. Food was so superb. Their stakes were juicy and tender. The burgers r to die for soooo good. But u have to leave room for desert. U got the beat chocolate cake, apple tarts, pecan pie where does stop. If ur on a diet i would stay away cause u will devour everything. Their only problem they r super busy its hard to get served so give all orders one shot cause there is no telling when u will catch a serve

Visited this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon for late lunch. Had to wait as we did not make a reservation and the place was filled. We ordered spaghetti and fish and chips. Food was quite ordinary. I had noticed that our food was ready and sitting on the kitchen counter for quite a while before the service staff picked them up and served us even though quite a few service staff walked passed the food. Our meal with 3 drinks plus taxes came to almost S$90/-. For that price, can get a better meal at some of the other restaurants in the same vicinity
3
The food was superb and could not be faulted, although overpriced for what you get. However, what I noticed is the sheer lack of customer service and attentiveness. Nobody seems too bothered about taking your order for food or drinks, we were left waiting for ages before our order was taken and the restaurant had only just opened and we were the only ones in there at the time. Once ordered, the food arrived quite promptly but once again nobody bothered to ask if everything was alright, or if we needed anything else. When it came to ordering desserts we had to get up and go and find someone to take our order. This is the first time I have visited Singapore and so far what I have noticed is that customer service is not important to Asian people, as they don't seem to offer any customer service whatsoever. Must be something to do with the fact that they automatically add a service charge to the bill, so they don't worry about the service they offer as they don't expect to get tipped anyway, so the type of service they offer wouldn't make a difference to them. I expect good service when paying a premium for food and would happily tip if I felt that I had received good/great service but unfortunately for me the service lets this restaurant down. Hopefully the manager may read this and review the training given to the staff

We went there around 6pm and they had Tea menu which had nibbles like burger and Sandwich. We decided to wait little longer and have dinner (dinner service starts at 6:30pm). We had their crispy bread selection with dips while waiting. The breads were nothing exceptional and the hummus dip was just fine while the artichoke & spinach dip was unique. We ordered penne chicken pasta and baked chicken breast for mains. The pasta well cooked and the sauce was good. The chicken was little over cooked and dry. For dessert we had flourless organe cake with butterscotch sauce and ginger coco creme brulee. Both of them were good. The food was average and I felt it's little expensive for a café menu. Starters are around 20 and the mains around 30, sides and desserts around 15+. I accept that the servings were huge but still the price doesn't justify it. I rather pay this amount to dine at a restaurant and have a better tasting food.Service was prompt and the ambience was casual. Well lit with natural lighting and the balcony seats had extra fans to keep patrons from sweating it all out. Overall its an average café that serves over priced food
4
Last week we went for dinner with four colleagues at PS café. Good atmosphere outside in a beautiful garden area. The service was great, good wine and very tasty food. One of my colleagues ordered a noodle salad with shrimps as main course. Unfortunately the salad is not enough as main course, although the price on the menu would suggest otherwise. The deserts are highly recommended
3
We did not make table reservation and just walked in thus the service staff told us we can only have the table for an hour. As 2 of my galfriends arrive ard 6pm+ thus we were ask to leave before 8pm. I finished work at 6.30pm and by the time i reach there is 7pm+. My concern when we were being reminded of the time is the Cafe is half empty but no option given. That make sure move to another Cafe nearby to continue our dining experience
2
I had heard about this cafe from friends. So finally I decided to go and try the food there. The ambience is nice but the food is just overprice. Not worth it at all. I would not recommend anyone to go there. Unless you don t care much about money
5
Cosy ambience although one must be prepared to feed the mossies if seated at the outdoor section. The truffle fries is to-die-for! For a gym junkie, that says alot :)
5
Lunch with the girls, dinner with your significant other, brunch with friends, a cheeky solo visit... It's all been good. Sunday brunch out on the deck is hard to beat.
4
I love PS Cafe, whether it's the Ann Siang Hill outlet, or the Dempsey or the one at Palais Renaissance!
4
Nice setting, casual , relaxed and amidst greenery . Food is good and portions are healthy . Dessert selection is so good - need to order more than one item to really enjoy! Staff are friendly ,helpful and energetic .
4
Love the location and the feel of the place. Food is average but desserts are great. Though weekends brunch are always very busy and queues are long.
4
We are regulars to PS Cafe. It's consistent with good food and atmosphere.
Prefer breakfast at the Dempsey Hill location and dinner/ drinks at the club st location
4
Food has big portion and is slightly above average. It is not the food but the atmosphere that i love about the restaurant. Surrounded by gardens of greenery in the middle of downtown Singapore, the place has a gay and relaxing air, with an opened concept that makes one feel closed to nature. With friendly staff around, you can't help being attracted to indulge yourself in the cozy mood of the plac
4
Casual little outlet at Tiong Bahru estate. Seating is somewhat limited. I love their pizzas and their home made ice cream! Pizzas are thin crust, done just right, not too chewy and their toppings are plentiful. Tasty! Comfort food for me! I am always amazed at their wide variety of wines and at affordable prices too! You are surrounded by these bottles of wine, everywhere you look! Friendly staff too! At great prices, this is a place you will return to, time and again for a nice, quite, casual and relaxed evening out! I never leave without a scoop of their ice-cream
4
This is one of my favourite places to stop off for lunch. They have a nice selection of salads, soups and other mains. Coffee is always good here. There desserts are to die for and always difficult to choose which one to haveThey have a number of sites. Favourite is Dempsey and Foru
5
Found a quiet surprise in old China town. A great place to stop for break from busy down town shopping a spot of lunch. Place has a casual elegance feel, good selection menu with choice wines and desserts. All our orders were very well presented and over-all service greatly surpass expectations. So much that we have returned for late night snack...loved the warm toffee caramel date pudding with cool vanilla bean ice-cream plus bits from my friends' choice

A very cosy place. Great for dates. Only downside is the steep prices of food & beverage. Still a good place to visit when you feel generous
5
There is a wide range from salads to meat. I am a carnivorous, so I love my beef. Try all the desserts please!

Our all time fav. places. Good food n location. Service is great too.Their cakes are huge n delicious.When my sister visited us we went there for a late dinner. It was my 2-year old's bedtime. They gave a table in the corner with the sofa/couch/lounge (whatever you can call it). My son slept peacefully there while we enjoyed a leisurely meal
3
They've a couple of outlets but I've only visited the one in Dempsey. Went there on a few occasion and was never disappointed with their main course. However, it's advisable to call and made reservation especially on weekends. On the other hand, their coffee is less than satisfactory. So is their cakes. The outdoor dining ambience is pretty romantic but the indoor area is noisy.

If you are looking for great food at reasonable prices the PS cafe on Dempsey is a great choice. I was taken here by a friend, whom frequents with his family, and his recommendation was right that the food was really good and had large portions. A must try is the truffle fries, large portion and great taste. Enough to share.Also, try to get an outddor seat nice shaded patio is great in the evening

You may be open but today I was disappointed and upset at your service! I came in with my 8 year old son who really wanted truffle fries! He is allergic to shellfish - I asked the waiter to check with the chef if they could use some fresh oil to fry the chips and he said they couldn't - this is without asking the chef. When asked why not he said I'll go check with the chef and then came out saying they couldn't - again after asking why not he said "because it would be a WASTE OF THE OIL that they use for the fries for your son" I was shocked !!!!We have travelled around the world with my son and restaurants cater to this request everywhere so WHY not PS cafe. After speaking at length with the manager it was one excuse after another - the oil won't get hot in time, the chef doesn't think it is a good idea...................I used to be a regular customer here but won't be going back! To have built it up to my son for months, the disappointment was immense!! You guys charge $15++ for a plate for fries - essentially potaoes so I imagine your profit margin would be huge and despite this not to cater for one 8 year old with allergies is SHOCKING!!!!!!!!!! I intend to make sure that this story is known to everyone I know

It is hard to find if you don't know Singapore. We were taken by a friend for lunch . It was very busy and we hadn't booked , we put our names down and were served a drink and waited outside in some comfy seats for our table . It didn't take long and a very nice young man came and got us.We enjoyed the food ,but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. It is full of ex pats with children, so seems very trendy and the place to be . Nice surroundings

If you are in Sg and craving for the best Choco cakes and digestive tea.. come to PS Cafe...at Harding Road in the Dempsey area.I always have digestive tea here or the calming hot tea. All os good once you reach here.I have been there with frens and with family. Both experiences have been nice. Their salada are good if you wish to have a big salad lunch.French Fries are my daughter's fave

Took wife on surprise anniversary dinner at PS Cafe in Harding Road.Without a car, one has to have a good sense of direction (or Google Maps) to locate the place.It's in a secluded area in a row of restaurants just adjacent to the Botanic Gardens. Book a table for dinner - place can get crowded.Service was good (Olivier, your recommendations rocked!), but with some slip ups (my Riesling never made it). Food was superb and in (more than) adequate quantities. We ordered the Caesar salad and the off-menu mussels in a spiced tomato sauce. The salad was bordering on bland, but quite pleasant (just not used to Caesar without the strong garlicky kick that Mario's in the Philippines is famous for) but the mussels were divine. Reminiscent of the ones I had in the now defunct Fish House in Melbourne. We shared a main of the rich beef pie and I'm glad I listened to my wife and did not order a separate steak main. The pie was enough for both of us. Garnished with a side of creamy mash and veggies, there was very little conversation until the main was consumed. Dessert consisted of a sticky date pudding swimming in caramel sauce topped with vanilla ice cream. While very pleasant and a good way to end a good meal, the bar for sticky date pudding was set very high by chef Carlo Miguel's Draft Gastropub in Taguig, so in all the one at PS Cafe was just rated above average.Not cheap, but not overly expensive (Figure S$50-70 a head without drinks). Now listed as a favourite in the Lion City

I am writing to complain about the appalling level of service that I received from your employee called ACE. Ace is a short and skinny female waitress who wears glasses and claimed to be the manager of PS Cafe, Harding Street / Dempsey Hill Branch. I arrived last Friday at 1900 as a walk-in customer and asked for a table for 4 people at 20:30. Ace perused her seating blotter and claimed that we could be seated at 20:45 but after admitting that we were only coming for dessert she all of a sudden changed her mind and said, “if you are coming in for dessert, actually I can’t offer you a table.” I turned around to speak to my wife and we had decided to eat at PS Cafe for dinner after all and not just dessert. Ace rudely replied, “I can’t offer you a table anymore because initially you said that you are coming in for dessert only.... It doesn’t matter what you say now. You can’t change your mind”, and she attended to the next customer. Obviously I was upset with her explanation, shook my head at utter disbelief and raised my voice. I requested to see the manager, but Ace said she was the manager. Ace became even ruder. I asked her what part she didn’t understand that we are now going to eat dinner at the restaurant, and Ace simply showed me the way to the front door and said “you can leave now please.” First of all, not only is her behaviour unacceptable but how can a restaurant discriminate against customers who will only come in for dessert?I have lived in Singapore for 3 years and I must say this is the first time I have come across a mean hearted individual. Ace from PS Cafe is definitely the worst customer service one can experience. If it had not been so crowded I might just have been tempted to take a bite out of her. As a restauranteur myself, the only way I feel we can improve service is by feedback from our customers and I should therefore be grateful if you would let me have an explanation about your employee ACE

The Good =)
~Over-priced.
~Low value for money.
The Bad =(
~Portions are small.
My Tip for future visits:
~Try the other F&B outlets at Dempsey.

I read some of the older reviews and would probably agree with the majority (i.e. some disappointments after having previously had good experiences) except for; one, I was not an "Ang Mor" (though probably pretty much one on the inside given my long tenure away in UK: see some previous reviews explaining the prejudiced poor treatment?!), and two, that my lunch date who I had not seen for over a year was quite so delightful and was the one who had booked on this glorious Christmas Eve brunch.The decor is indeed as described by many with a spacious US brasserie feel, high ceilings and expansive glass windows, balanced with wood decor all round, and in a jungle woodland setting (albeit isolated clinically by glass facades) here in one of the Dempsey's enclaves.Black Cod and King Prawns were our festive main course choices on this Christmas Eve and though competent they were perhaps a touch unremarkable but by no means unpalatable. The service was "neither here nor there" as one says out East, but nothing to complain about, though this is from a perspective of a Londoner who returns to Asia often enough to understand that service levels here are as volatile as London weather itself.All in all a very pleasant venue and I even took a few extra moments to take a look round at the bar area as well as the leafy environs that PS is idyllically situated amongst. I think they will always have a strong patronage from all types of Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans as it were, even though some previous reviewers speak of "too many teenagers" or perhaps they tersely meant irksome "riff raff" more likely, as the "broad middle class of Singapore" gets increasingly affluent !I left satisfied with brunch and even more interested to pursue the afternoon with some refreshed vigour, despite the tropical midday sunshine

Get a table outside as inside can be noisy. Is generally busy most of the time. The menu is varied and good. The moussaka is fab as are many other items on the menu, truffle fries are a favourite to go with everything! It's not cheap but this is Singapore! Relaxed atmosphere in a garden type setting
2
In October 2012 my husband and I ate at PS cafe on Dempsey hill and we simply loved it : food, atmosphere, services all was perfect. So we decided to go back during our usual trip to Singapore. The menu is quite poor with few choices for main courses apart from many pasta dishes. Given the fantastic experience I had last year, I decided ( I'm Italian !) to risk a pasta main course ( rigatoni with crab & caviar). It was disgusting ! The pasta seemed to float in a old cheap oil pond and it was uneatable ! My husband had a steak that was just ok, small piece of meat for that price and poorly grilled. When I complained the waiter apologised and took off my main course from bill, but frankly I would have rather had a nice meal ! Still the bill was still not cheap at all at around 200 S$ from 2 starters one main a medium price wine. Atmosphere is also gone, restaurant is now attended by large groups of teens eating chips ! Shame

After having noodles, it was dessert time at P.S. Cafe. It was full house, and I forgot how they managed to allocate two bar seats for us.The Pecan Pie with Ice Cream is indeed very close to those you see on Martha Stewart Show or the classic Louisiana's style pecan pies. Served chilled (not reheated at all), the sticky brown molasses that intertwined with the nuts were very sweet and fragrant but the pecan nuts were slightly rancid. And at the price of $14++ for this, I thought I had made a rash decision to come here. For full review, pls visit my blog

They have a couple of restaurants in SIngapore. The ambiance is very nice, beautiful people, always crowded at lunch time. But I think that it is very expensive. For example, to have 2 caesar salads, one lemongrass tea, still water and two long coffee for two people, you are going to spend 78SG
2
It's not hard to understand why PS Cafe is so successful. It panders shamelessly to an 'expat lifestyle' that so many cling on to so shamelessly in Singapore. All of this however is masking the fact that the restaurant is basically lousy.Whilst the setting is perfectly nice and the outdoor part good if you have children, there is little behind the pleasing aesthetics. The menu is hopelessly formulaic and basic and the wide variety of cuisines on offer is actually a tell tale hint that they specialise in nothing other than reheating food in a microwave. The wine list is unimaginative and the service is a bit of struggle although they usually avoid being outright rude. PS Cafe will continue to have a following but it is unfortunately going to be a crowd chasing something else other than good food and drink. There are infinite better choices in Singapore
2
I created this account just to comment on the fish & chips at PS Café simply because of how bad it was. I visited PS Café for dinner on 16 Nov and while the drinks and fries were all good, the fish & chips was the worse I have tasted anywhere. Being such a common dish, I did not expect fish & chips priced at $29 to be coated with a tough skin of flour and for the fish to not even taste fresh. Visit PS Café at Harding Road if you must, but please skip this horrible dish
4
PS Cafe is generally one of the most talked about restaurants in Singapore. I have dined here more than a dozen times and have seen several trends. I find the brunch experience better than the dinner experience because of the garden view & overall vibe. The food at brunch (especially the brunch burger & fish & chips) stands out more than the food at dinner. The service can be inconsistent unfortunately.If you go for brunch and you have young kids, try to get there near opening at 9:30am. It fills up quickly
1
I have to agree with another reviewer here. I too have visited PS Cafe quite a lot in the past but will no longer hand over any more of my hard earned cash. I was there about 3 months ago with friends and our waitress was so rude and got especially annoyed when we wanted to order another round of drinks. She was snappy and tried to talk us in to having water instead. All to save her having to put another order through.....crazy really. To be honest, we were all pretty unimpressed with our meals too - as many reviewers have mentioned, it's really over-priced.After that experience, I decided I wasn't going back but a friend wanted to go and I thought, why not, surely it can't be any worse. This time, I received a meal that tasted really bad (the other person at the table also agreed) and couldn't eat it. I left the food uneaten and was very pleasant and polite and let them know that I could not eat it due to it's terrible taste and did not want them to include it on the bill. Some rude waiter came over to advise me that I had to pay for the soup no matter what. No apology or anything. Of course I refused and won in the end. The reaction was that they handed me a revised bill and never came to collect my credit card - they really acted like idiots on purpose. A lot of people would have just walked out without paying, but I decided to do the right thing and settle for the rest of the items up at the counter. I however will be sticking to my guns and will NEVER EVER visit this restaurant again

I think I had the best fish & chips here, not to mention the deserts!
4
The food at PS café is very good and nicely presented, however it is on the pricey side and not good value for money. The setting on Dempsey Hill is lovely and the restaurant is quite popular.
5
As I said in the title, it's a lovely atmosphere with great food and friendly staff.
Location is so great far from the city and yet you can reach there in 10 minutes Taxi.
Reservation is highly advised as its getting full at night..

Have been to this outlet quite a few time, and we were looking forward to having brunch there, but it turned out to be a disappointment. The burger was good and with a nice presentation, but then it went downhill from there. The Beef pie looked nice, but not tender, and the plate and mashed potatoes/asparagus were ice-cold, and the shepherd's pie had almost not meat in it. Overall the portions are on the big side, scale them down and improve quality, and service is also an issue, we saw other guest that had to help themselves to get ice water. By the time we had finished the brunch we decided against desserts, which used to be good. Much better choices at Dempsey now

We have been dinning at this chain since they inaugurated a decade ago. It used to be our favorite place for social gatherings. It was fashionable, exciting and service was exceptional. We went there this morning again for brunch, and the restaurant was almost full at 10 am as it is a public holiday. For weekends and public holidays, it is 1st come 1st serve, no reservation, as this is a very popular venue with long queue during lunch and dinner times. I was sorry that we had a disappointing experience today. The service is sloppy and robotic. The food is below average and over priced. We each ordered a main course plus coffee, which cost >$40 per head inclusive of 7% GST and 10% service fee (with little service). The Beef burgundy pie came with cold mashed potatoes, over salted beef and hard/overcooked vegetable, we straggled to swallow them. Shepherd pie was sour with little meat, very ordinary, but better than the beef pie. The corned beef hash was interesting and tasty, for those who like oily potato skins. The brunch burger was good, but S$35.30! Overall the food is ordinary. Location at Harding Road is fantastic, but interior is tired and tables are dirty. Time to reinvent the business
4
My most favorite location is Dempsey Hill. I like their menu, and the week-day lunch soup and sandwich combination is wonderful. Tomato soup and smoked salmon sandwich is the one I love. The service is inconsistent. Sometimes, you are lucky and get a very attentive waiter, sometimes they look straight through you and do not refill water or take dessert order. The restaurant floor is a bit over-crouded, but there are still people waiting to get a table. The main courses are great, the desserts are hit-and-miss. My favorite dessert is sticky date pudding.

Firstly may I say i have been a big fan of the ps cafe concept and a regular patron to all of the outlets over the past several years.I lunched today at the Harding rd restaurant. On arrival a familiar face (staff memebr) greeted me pleasantly at the reception area and showed me to a lovely table on the terrace, this was however the end of any service what so ever. The staff were apathetic, not at all attentive in taking orders, refilling water and actually overall extremely useless, we were forced to get up and go the the staff perhaps 6 times during our 6 hour lunch.After several hours of patience, I entered the restaurant and asked for napkins, that should have been provided with the food. I then expressed my deep disatisfaction with the level of service. A staff member did come out and attempt to clear the table and apologise for the day, however when we left the restaurant, no one approached us to say good bye, thankyou or apologies.I am sad to say that my patronage to the ps cafe group is over.Beyond terrible...
3
It has the feel of a casual place but priced like something more. I love the design and feel of this place. It is actually one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. The food is great though typical Singapore, a bit pricey. Reservations are a hassle to get as they often will not answers the phone and this want you to make reservations via text messages. A bit of a hassle. The amazing desert makes it all worth it
3
On the advice of a friend of a friend (yup I followed that line of advice, as I did not know directly anyone living in Singapore ;-) )So up Dempsey hill you will find this place.Nice location, with a great terrace on a green area.The inside decoration is modern and quite posh.I went there only for coffee and cake. Coffee is great, my cake was average.The rest of the food looked very nice though, and people seemed happy about theirs :-)It's a typical place for expats, with a friendly but quite "posh" service, no real warmth in the service.Seems a lot like the place to be because it has been declared as such, and not because it fully deserves it
4
We visited PS with my daughter and family who live in Singapore. P S is a favourite restaurant of theirs. We sat outside surrounded by an open area my grandson could wander around. The food was served promptly. I had Chillies prawn followed by a shared plate of chocolate profiteroles. The whole meal was delicious. It is east to see why our daughter and family love going there
4
Great restaurant in Singapore across the street from Hilton Hotel. The outdoor area overlooks the Thai embassy and is simply a great atmosphere. The food is excellent from ribs to meat loaf, the Miso Cod is excellent. Good service and reasonable prices for Singapore
3
This is a nice place especially if you get a seat facing the "jungle". Food is alright but service....mm... Room for improvement!
4
Lovely place in Dempsey, Singapore, not far from Botanic Garden and Holland village.
Food and service were excellent and the surrounding peaceful away from the bustling of Singapore.
The menu is a bit pricey though but worth it.
3
The food was good but the atmosphere was amazing. Located in a very quiet residential area surrounded with trees and lots of greens
4
Advisable to get a taxi there. Think there is buses along the main road. But will need to walk up to Demsey Hill. Truffle fries is highly recommended. You can order the truffle fries by itself at SGD15, or if your meal comes with a side of fries (e.g. PS Burger), you cann add SGD5 to change it to truffle fries. Orea milkshake is also highly recommended. Meal size is big and good for sharing. There is no reservations allowed. So go early to avoid the queue. Or expect to wait
4
Food is always superb and a good price and good size portions, service unfortunately can be patchy and most times you may have to ask a few times for water refill, or to take your desert order. Fine if you are not in a rush, but can be a bit frustrating
4
After waiting approximately 30minutes for a table (they don't take reservations) we were shown to a lovely table outside on the verandah, surrounded by trees and a delightful outlook. Lunch was the best Hamburger I have eaten in years and the refreshing Mango & Mint drink was just what was needed on a hot July day in Singapore. Couldn't complain with the service as everything flowed smoothly. Would recommend this Restaurant to all
4
My friends and I went to this restaurant last Saturday, searching for a beautiful place to enjoy coffee and tea in the midst of Singapore busyness. And yes we found it in PS Cafe, Dempsey Hills. We enjoyed the ambiance, the green trees and grass view, the music they played, and just sat there and did nothing but to enjoy the afternoon. We ordered double chocolate cake and something like a cream puff (which I forget the name) and they were good. But my lemon grass tea is disappointing, it really tasted like just water with slices of dried lemon grass. And the spoon they served for us to enjoy the cake was just too big like we're having a baked rice instead of a chocolate cake. Over all, I would definitely go back here and enjoy my afternoon in Singapore for the next trip
5
The location of this restaurant is the simplest breath taking thing ever.Located in a quiet residential area, it has a combination of indoor and outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is next to a green field, with tall trees and wind whistling in and out of the entire place.Its a multi-cuisine restaurant and the food is not priced too high. The service is good, staff are polite and helpful. The entire restaurant is a non-smoking area; if you have to smoke then you can take your beer mug and go to the smoking zones, have a puff and come back.I just loved the green backdrop against which this restaurant was set against. Truly memorable brunch I had with my friends
2
This cafe is overrated and i ordered lulu's leftovers lasagna in the description the only vegetable was broccoli when we got our meal it was only vegetables with no pasta in sight the pesto was sour and ruined the taste . the only good part of our visit was the vanilla milkshake:
4
Was a great night out with good food and a good vibe. First time in singapore and really enjoyed this place. Food was tasty and we had alot of fun here
5
This is one of my best dining experiences. PS. Cafe, especially the one at A.S.H. Park, has it all in terms of atmosphere, decoration (kind of colonial-Gothic chic), food, drinks, dessert, service, and even music. It serves huge dishes and it has a whole lot of wine selection. Great dessert! (You must leave a real big room for their gigantic double decked chocolate cake.). Young children and family gathering are not welcomed here, which is just perfect
4
I was very impressed by the PS Cafe where we were taken by some ex-pat friends. We went for dinner on a Friday night. The restaurant was busy (not helped by the rain outside) but there was a very good menu plus a selection of beautiful desserts to tempt us. A very nice evening
5
In Singapore it is a pleasure to be sitting under the glorious trees in the cool shade and enjoying nature. Add great food and great company and this is a special place. Time seems to slow down and the joy of the tropics seems to soak into your skin. A must for a slow restful time with special friends or family
5
This is first and foremost, a cafe, which means that the food are overpriced and may not be to everyone's liking.However, there are certain dishes in their regular menu which is just that fantastic that i have to order them every time i drop by.in addition to that, they have a great dessert selection and a finger food for a small group of friends just out to chill.The owner have a good sense of choosing the various locations for his outlets too as all of them, except the paragon branch, provides great scenery to accompany your meal and the after party
2
Before writing this, I searched online for an email address for the management because they should always get first wind of a complaint and should have the opportunity to respond privately. Sadly, none was forthcoming on their website or their FB page so here we are...First of all, please note that it is a CAFE (as the name states) so despite all efforts to make their outlets look like restaurants, expect CAFE service and you won't be disappointed...I, of course, having been wooed by the decor and lighting, expected restaurant service, something the cafe needs to grow up and try harder to become.I met with 4 other people, a couple of them for the first time. We sat at the corner of the restaurant furthest from the front door, next to a large mirror, by all intents a cosy nook.All was well until the food came out. A slightly impatient sounding waitress came up behind me and stated the dish she was about to serve. When we indicated who the dish belonged to, she stretched in front of me to pass it to my friend so I said, "Please go around" and she did but the dish went down with a thump (ie I'm not happy with you for asking me to be polite and not stick my arm in your face as I shove a plate of food past you)[Another point to note, the cutlery and napkins are in a metal tumbler on each table at this branch of the CAFE] and my new acquaintance asked the same waitress if she could trouble (the waitress) for more cutlery as there was insufficient in the tumbler. We certainly got as we asked as a handful of cutlery got thrown into the tumbler. Metal thrown against metal= loud clanging noise.Indulge me by allowing me to explain my expectations of this scenario:Customer: "Could I trouble you for more cutlery?"Server: "Sure!" and grabs the tumbler, refilling it to the brim with cutlery and napkins and returning to say "Here you go"Customer: "Thanks!"I didn't think we were reaching for rainbows and unicorns here. No, we didn't even expect smiles or, god forbid, a pleasant tone of voice!But suffice it to say that the food did come out quite quickly. This coffeeshop is always well patronised because it serves up decent food in a great ambient location but never because of the good service. Singapore was experiencing a very high pollution index rating so everyone was huddled into any indoor restaurant/coffeeshop they could find, so it was a busy night. But in my view, that has to be a positive thing for management, and although tough for waiting staff, it's still something positive. It was then time to pay the bill, and as we were not all known to each other, we decided to split it. Some had cash, some needed to go on credit. In the end after an "internal" discussion some paid by card but a couple of us needed some $10 notes to make the necessary contributions. Another new acquaintance went to the cashier to break two $50 notes into tens. What she ended up facing was a cashier who looked at her in horror and stated "I cannot guarantee" and repeated this statement a couple of times. In the end, despite gentle persuasion on her part, she managed to come away with... not a lot of change. So one of us underpaid (how embarrassing!) because we couldn't get any change.My expectation of a restaurant, sorry, CAFE, is that there will be people from all walks of life strolling in. Eg teenagers, housewives, tycoons, girlfriends, boyfriends, and strangely, some groups may wish to split...the...bill. If I come in with a group of 20 people and we say we want to split the bill, I'd expect the coffeeshop management to come up with certain conditions PLEASANTLY stated to deal with it. Eg. "Hi all, hey, just to let you know, we have a policy whereby we won't be able to split your bills into more than 4 groupings. Would you prefer to pay under one bill or shall I just take your orders in groupings...." I digress. My point is: 5 people, 3 credit cards and breaking $100- which part of that poses a problem? I'm not sure but I can't "guarantee" a response...and goodbye and don't let the door hit you as you leave our cafe...Thanks. But no thanks. I'm too old for this. I just wanted a night out. But next time, before I leave my house, I'll be sure to raid my children's piggy banks so I can stuff my evening bag with hundreds of dollars worth of change

PS Cafe is a great place to go for a long lunch or brunch - the food's great, but even better is the green surroundings and view. Great way to feel like you're getting out of the city without having to go very far. They don't take reservations for brunch on weekends, so go early, though tables do seem to turnover pretty quickly. It's a great little place, but it requires some patience...service isn't the greatest
1
We were excited to go to this restaurant based on a recommendation as my colleagues are foodies to the core. This restaurant was VERY disappointing. Not only was the food terrible in flavor, 4 of the five dishes were cold and the service was terrible. The presentation of the food looks nice but it fell flat. We decided to give it one more chance and get dessert. How to you mess up dessert? Well...PS Cafe has figured it out we ordered the fudge brownie and carrot cake neither were good and we left 90% of each dessert on the plate and this was split between 5 people. The service was just as bad as the food, we had to ask someone to take our drink order then, ask another waiter to take our entree order and then ask another waiter to take our dessert order. We were all very disappointed in this restaurant and if you are a true international foodie you may feel the same way
5
This is a real little gem in the concrete jungle of Singapore. It's tucked away in a corner, overlooking and surrounded by this beautiful wild garden and lots of green. The food is fantastic, fresh and plentiful, especially the dessert! A wonderful feeling of space and an excellent, chilled-out, relaxed and happy vibe, completely with great jazz in the background and lots of nice smells! TIP: Ask for an outdoor table if you can, it's really breezy, cool and fresh and such a treat to overlook the garden (especially at night when the fairylights are all lit up!
4
I was going to say that PC needs to change its menu now and again but they have specials and my family seem to want to return again and again. Favourites are burgers and Miso Cod. Puddings excellent and it's not bad value for money (not great either but it is in Dempsey). We will be back
5
It's a place you could enjoy dining as family or couple with lazy late afternoon atmosphere...Surrounded by greeneries...seating inside and outside...It's like U r having Great Meal in High Class Designed Garden.
2
went with two others to Palais Renaissance PS cafe. Middling service with one good server and one indifferent. Poor food preparation and overpriced for that quality. Wine selection ok. Needs a revamp of the kitchen
2
Food was pathetic, the service horrendous - wine arrived after the food, nobody to refill your glass - simply bad...choice of wine - sad...they charge fairly heftily but their quality of food has truly deteriorated...
5
I went the with some friends on a Tuesday night. It was busy, but the crowd was nice. The place has a very good vibe and they play good music. The personnel was friendly and receptive. We tried the fudgy cappuccino cheesecake - very tasty but not the best. We also had the cherry tiramisu which wasn't to die for and another one with caramel sauce (butterscotch something - can't remember the name exactly) and this one was divine. I was very satisfied as an overall experience
4
Ideally located - 10 minutes taxi ride from orchrad road - with a green scenery, this is my favorite cafÃ© to have a brunch / lunch. Very relaxed, arty, happy place. The menu offers a wide range of choice - from cesar salad to croque monsieur, including some amazing pesto pasta with fresh vegetables... The wine is really good too. Might be a bit pricey according to some, but I guess fresh products and a bit of tendance makes that happe
3
Anywhere that serves Poutine with truffle oil is a bit up its own behind!The mains were ok, in fact I am trying hard to remember what I had!But the puddings are fantastic - as are the drinks - so go and feast on puds and drink the cocktails!
3
Been here three times now and I think I know what the problem is, too busy. The kitchen staff need to take a tiny bit more time about the cooking and being careful with the food. Maybe I'm being over zealous and it was just a very salty tomato soup, but its just a soup. Nothing too complicated.Would I go back again? Yes, just wouldn't have the soup. Everything else is great. Good atmosphere, great service and the majority of the food was lovely. Just cant give four star rating on this visit
4
Visited PS a few nights ago in the middle of a strong rain storm so feel as if I missed out on views etc. however the food was really great. I love hawker food however the odd smart meal such as from PS is yummy. No idea about about price as I was there on business and didn't pay (even better!) Amazing puddings and cakes, we shared two (between 3... no more needed) puddings chocolate brownie cake & carrot cake..... WOW

Location is superb. We keep telling ourselves the brunch / meals are decline but we had visitors in town who like the location and were looking forward to the big breakfast remembered from bygone days.Other than noticing people flagging down wait staff for missing menu items, salt & pepper (cos' we were doing the same) - you can expect inconsistent portions and food arrangement.$22 dollars for a straight up very ordinary Caesar salad is ridiculous. The mushroom stack is spread across the plate and is 1/4 of the size it has been in the past. These are just 2 examples that had us grumbling. Ps cafe is seriously hit and miss - i know this and i think its only the location that keeps me coming back. Just like i know i won't be back in a hurry unless its for coffee and cake

First up, it's a great place to bring your date to. However, the place is always pretty crowded especially during the weekend evenings. Food-wise is pretty alright I must say, nothing wOAH! about that (the good point is PS Cafe's food portions are served in large amounts). Price-wise, a tad pricier than a normal restaurant in other places like Holland Village, Rochester or even Orchard. The cakes and desserts gets my attention instead especially the chocolate cake which is served with vanilla ice cream and warm chocolate sauce. Splendid! One will need to catch a cab/taxi down to Harding Road from the nearer places such as Tanglin or Orchard.. as it can a be pretty good long walk into the area from the bus stop outside Dempsey

Still a trusted choice after all these years. Nice place for a weekend brunch but you need to get there early or late to beat the parents with babies crowd. Food is so so but acceptable overall with a nice buzzy ambience.

From the moment we arrived it was plain that the staff are not competent and were often plain rude. The food is quite good but for the price and overall experience I will not go back.

I love the nice and chill ambience suitable for gatherings and chill-ing out with friends! PS cafe served very nice cakes!! Especially love the outlet at dempsey road as its the feel is relax and romantic. Good to celebrate friends' birthdays over there! =)

The service at PS cafe has deteriorated to a pathetically low level. I visited the place for brunch on last Sat and though there were empty tables all around, the waiters there seem to turn a blind eye towards the queue waiting to be served! We even have to call out to the snobbish waiters passing by the reception several times and they can actually pretend to walk past you even when they caught your eyes! Best still, we managed to grab a waiter and asked to be served and yet, after asking us to wait, he went on chatting with his fellow stuck-up colleague right before our eyes and was standing so near to us that we managed to catch their conversation which are utterly not work related. And needless to day, he completely forgot about us since no one bothers to host us after a good 20 mins. Other waiters are the same and when complained to one of their head waiter or manager about this, he simply nodded his head and walked away without even an apology! Such disgusting service does not deserve any 2nd time customer or any service charge seeing that no service has been provided. I would never return again.

Over the years I have seen PS slide to another typical Singapore success story. Staff are up themselves and have a dislike of Ang Mohs. Food is overrated and over priced. Service is stunningly poor and loaded with arrogant disrespect. Decore on the other hand is wonderful At least the staff can't stuff that up.
3
We went for tea and cakes. We seated on the terrace due the excellent view. Instead of the tea we choose a very good assorted home made drinks (Fresh Mango & Mints Cooler) and the "Ultimate Fudge" cake, was a very good chocolate cake with fudge, but to much for us. The service was diligent and the atmosphere really nice
3
Main dishes is not exactly great. Truffles fries and the cakes (double choc, butterscotch banana and cappucino) was good though. But the ambience is awesome. We were seated outside for a table of 9 pax. Server was a guy named Marvin and his service was exceptionally great. Attended to our request to surprise a birthday girl with cakes and song. And while taking orders, he noted that we are a group of Malays/Muslim. So he was attentive enough to point out dishes that has bacon/pork to ensure we won't accidentally order it. Appreciate the attentive service rendered to us! :
3
One of the few place to sit and eat near "green space", which was really nice. The food was ok... would say appetizers (bread/hummus plate) were above average, but the fish and chips were quite greasy (below expectations). Staff was in a rush for our group to order, which dampened the experience a bit... but still overall a good place, but expected a bit better
3
This was the first time I had been to a PS Café. We reserved a table as heard that it can be very busy.You need to take a taxi as the café is in Dempsey Hill area so no bus or MRT nearby.Large indoor and outdoor seating area, mix of clientele from couples, groups of friends and families. I found it incredibly noisy in the café as lots of children, wouldn't recommend it for a romantic meal.Lots of items on the menu to choose, everything from a coffee and cake to wine and lasagne. There were four of us and we had a main course and a dessert each with a bottle of white wine to share. The bill was just under $200 which was very expensive for a lunch. The service at the beginning of the meal was extremely attentive, in fact too much, we were unable to finish reading the menu before we had another waiter asking us "if we were ready to order". Once we had ordered we then became invisible and it was difficult to attract the attention of the staff.The food was very nice although I feel expensive for the small amount. I ordered Lasagne which is exactly what I got! nothing to accompany it, no salad or garlic bread just lasagne.I personally would go back to the café and have a coffee and a slice of cake. The cakes were really good especially the steamed ginger sponge - excellent flavour
1
Been there many times and the standard have consistently gotten worse. Now I will not return. The food is expensive but was worth the price when they started as it tasted good and food came hot. Now you might as well go to a local coffee shop. Service is inconsistent at best. We do like the surrounding and don't mind paying more if only the quality is reasonable. Once I had dinner there and when I asked why my wifes dinner is already on our table for 20mins and mine no served, waiter replied after checking that what I order was just sold out. I reordered and ask my wife to start eating her already cold dinner. Nobody came to apologise as we didn't kick a fuss. That was my 2nd last visit. Last visit we when there for tea. Coffee was not hot, cakes were dry and cookies were stale. The surrounding was nice though. Decor very simple and nice. What a waste
4
they have lots of branch now, every branch has unique quality of the food. but the atmosphere of each places are great, the owner has brilliant idea design or concept.
5
Its a place which you will start liking the moment you enter. On the entrance passage you see a line of cakes and desserts. Very simple yet great interiors. Great variety of food and beverages. My favorite is the Egg white omelet and eggplant pate
5
All of the locations are fantastic. Usually restaurants that become so popular they can open multiple branches let the service and quality slip. This is not the case for PS cafe. After a decade they are still at the top of their game with each location being unique enough that it is worth visiting all of them, yet they all have a certain familiarity about them. Would highly recommend
3
Nice cafe, hidden among the trees on Dempsey Hill. Went there for dessert, and wasn't disappointed. The Double chocolate cake is huge. Services is good, and waiters are well-spoken. Only drawback is that there may be the occasional mosquito or two, if you're dining on the veranda.Importantly, reservations are necessary, as the place is highly popular
2
The place was packed at lunchtime on a weekday. We waited more than 40 minutes for the food but sadly wasn't worth it...I ordered the Moroccan vegetarian dish which on the menu promised lots of grilled vegetables with some couscous. Instead I had a big pile of pasta pearls (first I didn't know what it was) and couscous and only a few pieces of vegetables. It was very vinegary then I realized that they used pickled paprika....It was definitely not worth for 25 dollars.Typical rip off. Nice lush green surrounding though. I guess that's what you are paying for..
4
On visit in SGP, the place was suggested by friends living in SGP! very nice table outside [our case], but inside nice as well with big windows, relaxed and friendly staff;knowledgeable staff both re. dishes on the menu as well as wines [although tried a lil' bit to talk us up the value range], good sized dishes, not minimalistic; my steak was cooked to perfection [I like 'rare', and often it is overcooked: not at PS CafÃ©!], the signature truffle oil fries real' nice and the date cake as dessert was just like heaven.Overall probably at the upper end of a suitable range, so would probably not make it a regular restaurant hang-out
5
Beautiful settings on this Dempsey hill location in Singapore. Defiantly need to make reservations; we arrived at 11:30am without calling ahead andwe had to wait (2) for over 15 minutes.I had the Eggs Benedict which was terrific and later finished off with a blueberry muffin which was once the best I have had in a long time.We were sitting fairly close to the kitchen window, so I got a peek at most of what was served.....everything looked delicious.From what I gather there are more locations of PS around Singapore, a definite must over Starbucks
4
So needless to say, ambience is great. Young couples, young PYT's, brooding writers, artsy folks, and the yuppie bankers in their Sunday best- shorts and flip flops. This outlet at Dempsey is a wonderful weekend brunch place. Come early and get ahead in the waiting list. The service is a bit slow at times, but the food portions more than make up for it. The quality of food is average. We ordered fish and chips, a "side order" of the truffle fries which came in a steak sized plate and an embarrassing number of fries on it. The fish was greasy, it was easy to leave the batter entirely. The truffle flavor in the fries was superb. Followed it up with a vegetable dip plate- the dips - chick pea, eggplant and another salsa variety were good. A lemon iced tea and peach iced tea thankfully were original iced teas not like what the rest of singapore does (pour regular tea over ice. Yeah.) closing brunch with the lovely gooey fudge brownie cake and green tea is a great idea. Beware, everything is gigantic sizes! The portions, and bill too. This meal for two ( without alcohol) cost us $160. People go here for the busy ambience. A better quality brunch though would be at Jones in Dempsey just round the corner of PS Cafe
3
The Rigatoni with crabmeat is spot on, although I found the local mojito a bit racey. View of surroundings nice and the staff are attentive, although slightly one-dimensional for topics of the day, week or month (internationally that is). Recommended to book and it was the best of company with the best conversation
5
A brilliant place to be. Outside, it does not look like anything. It is bit like a 'don't judge a book by its cover' thing. Once you are in and able to have a table, the dying starts by just looking at those sumptuous cakes. Beware about those 'long black' coffees. They are no good. Other than that the service is good and the cakes are deadly
5
one of the most pleasant places to dine in Singapore. great food and ambiance! The best PS Cafe is at dempsey hill and be sure to try the brunch there.
4
It is always great to dine outdoor under the green foliage.
Have always loved the menu, and food never fails.
Great for dinner with friends and just as great with spouses. So this isn't a place for quiet romantic dinners but just as fun.
5
The best Ps cafe is in Harding Road.. the location is great, service very good ! Variety of food is perfect. And every single dish is perfect!! Is a must go restaurant!

<I am especially referring to their outlet in Dempsey>Look nowhere else if you want to take your guests from HK, ideally to a week-end brunch. Better reach by 11am-1130am, before it gets packed. The best seats are outside, inside gets swarming with kids and very noisy.why HK? well, your guests will be shellshocked - having a coffee with a view on a patch of blue sky and beautiful old trees, that's gonna change them from being packed like sardines in one of these Soho cafes overlooking the escalator, no doubt about it.The other advantage is that your HK guests won't probably mind the bill. Drinks in particular are totally overpriced, and can end up making half of your bill. it's 5$ for a black coffee (you'll need 2 to feel satisfied) and 10$ for a fruit juice (nothing exotic - carrot or apple)... before GST, but of course.Don't get me wrong, i like the place. My favourite dishes include their banana muffin (with real chunks of fruit inside) and their cheese quiche with caramelized onions. The service is friendly, the atmosphere very pleasant. Just get your HK friends to foot the bill hehe
3
It seems to be the place to go and is always really busy. We've been there for lunch, dinner and afternoon tea. The cakes for afternoon tea are huge and great! And it was probably the best time as it was quiet. However, I still think the place is over-rated. During lunch it was REALLY loud and hard to have a conversation. We sat inside. For weekend brunch our friends got there early (before 10am) and got a table outside. This was quieter and the setting is really lovely out on the verandah. Nice and quiet and you wouldn't imagine you were in the middle of a big city. The food for brunch was just ok. Lunch the food was good and worth the money, for brunch I am really not sure what the fuss is about.For kids, it was pretty accommodating. We took the stroller next to the table outside. The time I went with friends for afternoon tea there was 1 or 2 tables occupied and they still asked if I could leave the stroller by the entrance. I actually pointed out a table to the staff and described how we could manage it just by moving one of the chairs. In terms of getting there, you need to take a taxi or drive. Though we walked from Holland road but there aren't proper sidewalks the whole way so you need to walk on the road. It is possible though as I've done it with a stroller. My preference would be to go out to the Saddle Club to Marmalade Pantry or Riders Club if you are looking for a quiet place to eat surrounded by nature
4
Each time we visit Singapore, we definitely have Saturday or Sunday breakfast at PS Cafe. The service is great and the food delicious! Only...be aware, they don't take bookings at P.S. Cafe Dempsey Hill, and being so popular on weekends, the waiting time can be 1/2 - 1 hour. It also isn't cheap, but then again, the meals are certainly worth it!In January this year, we had a midweek lunch at the PS Cafe Renessance in the city - fabulous
5
PS cafe is the perfect spot for a brunch with friends or as a couple. Since they don't take reservations on the weekends be prepared to queue, especially on a clear day. There are clear tables but you will still need to wait... Just make sure your name gets on the wait list! We ordered the Caesar salad with poached Egg with rosemary chicken and a side of truffle fries. Both were beautifull cooked and seasoned. We asked for a pot of their lemon grass mayonnaise to go with the chips, it compliments them perfectly- and we just love that dip! If you are going on a week day or evening try the PS burger.If you are going to the Ann Siang Hill restaurant bear in mind they don't allow children
4
We waited 45 minutes to be seated only to find that the guy taking the reservations had forgotten about us. We ended up with a great table outside. I had the Ceasar salad with poached egg, and it was perfect. Service was a bit slow but the overall experience was quite good
3
We've given this place a try about 2 or 3 times and we've promised ourselves we won't return. This is one of the coveted, trendy restaurants in Singapore. The atmosphere is family-like, at least the Dempsey one where all families go to, so you'd think they would make it easy for adults with children. Quite the opposite: the waiters are really uneasy with children around, even the most well-behaved ones like ours. The food is good, not exceptional, but not worth it if you cannot relax and chat
4
Restaurant with a garden pavilion feel to it, offering airconditioned and open air space. The French fries seem to be the ''special of the house'' as they appear on most tables. Food was correct if not special. Welcome was warm and friendly and from there onwards there were little more smiles. Staff seem not to be happy, which spoils the dining experience. But for a simple meal in the heart of town, we can recommend this restaurant
5
EVERY dish I have had is sensational. Each restaurant has slighlty different menu, but always my fave: Lulu's leftover lasagne. Amazing! Specials always fresh and changing also.
5
Great food, great service, relaxing ambiance. No matter how many years have gone by the whole things are so consistent. Giant cake to share after a scrumptious meal :-)
4
You should go there for one thing and one thing only. And I will repeat it just to hit the 100 character minimum for this review: truffle fries truffle fries truffle fries truffle fries truffle fries truffle fries
4
Busy place this one with a mixture of the local foreign community and Singaporeans a like. The Dempsey hill location serves up a simply and hearty brunch, lunch, snack or dinner whichever you choose and its in a good green setting, laid back atmosphere (depending on which nationality sits next to you however) and fair service.The place can get busy and when its known within the different foreign communities depending on the day and time it can get very full.Never had a bad meal here though on a busy day it can be overwhelming - not a bad thing if you also want atmosphere.The Orchard road location, upper floors of Paragon is also worth a stop in if you shopping and need a quick snack. Good food and pricing too but again can be busy depending on the timeWorth a stop at either if you are after cafe food without the full restaurant requiremen
4
I have been using PS Cafe for many years now but have to say that which one you choose is key to your dining experience.PS Dempsey of course has a great rural ambience but the menu is becoming dull and the daily specials lack imagination whereas PS Paragon has a very different feel and for my money,is markedly better in terms of service,specials and overall quality.One expects they should be the same but trust me,they are not.What they do also have in common though is both are very pricey and pushing the limits of value for money
4
Went to this cafe a couple of times. The ambience is wonderful, it being a nice cosy place tucked at a corner of the Dempsey area.Wasn't particularly wow-ed by the food. Felt that the desserts were a little too sweet for my taste. But sitting there and chatting with a friend was really quite relaxing and nice!Unfortunately, cos everyone comes here and chat, sometimes the place gets a little noisy. Perhaps on cooler days, the outside will be better
3
I struggle to review this restaurant because as much as i like the ambience, the food is overrated and over-priced. Basically, you're paying an exorbitant price for a serene, pretty setting. The waitstaff is mediocre; they need to be better-trained. Communications seems to be an issue here. Overall, a great option to hang out with your GFs for a few hours for brunch, coffee or afternoon break
4
Nice home made ice creams flavour. Very good chill out relaxing place for coffee, tea, quiet reads or catching up sesisons amongst friends. Ambience extremely cool and worth the experience! I will return to try the food some time soon. Would recommend this place for high tea and just lots and lots of chattings or some quiet enjoyment of food
4
Very nice place in a secluded and very picturesque spot. Popular with a youngish crowd, food is quite pricey and I suppose in many cases is possibly overpriced for what it really is, but then this is Singapore, and it also tasted really nice and was well presented. Atmosphere is great and it was very busy on a Sunday afternoon. We couldn't reserve, as it's just walk in for brunch onwards on a Sunday and we waited about half an hour. I believe this restaurant doesn't allow children which will obviously be a showstopper for many, but having been to one of their other restaurants for lunch on a weekday (when it just happened to have a number of screaming babies in as well) it's maybe not such a bad thing. I fully appreciate that not everyone will agree, but I suppose at least the restaurant makes their policy clear on their website, and if people don't agree, then they won't frequent it
4
Because a lot of Ang Mo's yearn for a nice cafe like back home (Australia, Europe, etc) PS Cafe is packed on weekends and even throughout the week you will find lots of semi bored Yoga mums hanging bout here. I love it because of the atmosphere, decent food (if a bit over priced) and good coffee (unless you order a take away to kill the waiting time, they boil the milk to death in my experience). Be prepared to wait at least 20-30 minutes especially if you're more than 2 unless you're very early or very late.
5
Lush beautiful greenery with both indoor n outdoor seating in this rate concrete isle.... Desserts are superb, try the key lime pie! Only shortfall is, you gotta drive or call for a cab, but hey, it's only 5 mins drive away from Orchard Rd!
5
I just love the PS Cafe at Dempsey Hill. Cozy ambience, lovely food, helpful staff. Try their truffle fries and wide range of tea selection.
4
Service a little lacking, but for Western food, salads, cakes and mains never disappointing. The one at Dempsey has a large garden kids can run around in.
3
they have good selection of brunch menus but some of them are not really that good. plus the service is not meeting our expectation. but the ambience is very relaxing and
5
While the host / hostess is very effective, service overall can be spotty. The view from the outdoor tables makes it worth it. If you have a table close to the windows, the overhang will keep you dry even in the rain. The pancakes are really of US top quality, something I can't often say about pancakes in Asia - very big, fluffy and the right flavor. Juices and drinks are very good. The desserts are absolutely to die for. As a native Texan, my taste for pecan pie is pretty specific and they have one of the best I've ever had . . . as theirs is 2x as thick as most. The chocolate cake is excellent and the carrot cake is really as good as the best I've ever had. They serve water out of pitchers which have carrots and other veggies in them . . . gives the water a bit of a flavor, which is a nice touch
3
The location is really, and I mean, really nice. the place is nicely done, perfect for a casual sunday brunch for instance. there is a lovely deck with lots of tables and a unique view on the green jungle. it is protected from the noise of the cars. just nice.The service was ok. First a waiter made a movement of the hand indicating us we had to get bak up on the little step that separated the waiting to be seated area and the restaurant (..?...), then our waitress was totally lost in the order, forgot one dish, decided it was not possible to get us for the same price a plate half the normal size for our child (1 pancake instead of 2 was too hard apparently?) so we had to get anotehr waiter. We also asked some help at the front desk because I have a gluten allergy but instead of sayin "no idea what this is", which happens and is ok, at least I know I need to be careful, they started advising me to have pasta (THAT is gluten).... I think they were just very busy and stressed. The food was ok. Not bad, just ok, but priced reasonnably. My scrambled eggs were as plain as can be (no seasonning, and no pepper/ salt/ or sauce on table), bacon was nice. Apparently the egg benedicts were also nice, not memorable.It is just an easy place, good with kids. good atmosphere . But don't go expecting a great meal
5
I had dinner here on a recent business trip to Singapore and had an amazing experience. I ordered the Cesar salad and was very satisfied with both the quality of the food and the portion size. The prices were a little steep (S$22 for a salad) but it was a great atmosphere and I would definitely return and try some other things on the menu
4
Very popular place for ex pats. We sat outside which was lovely and not so noisy. Good service and well cooked tasty food although a bit on the pricey side. As everywhere in Singapore the wine was prices way over the top at $80 a bottle
5
OK...maybe it's just me but I love great fries. The fries here are to die for. I could just eat them every night. Order a serving of their special fries before your main course and it'll get you ready for a dining experience that is out of the world
2
Service was appalling here. We ordered drinks and food. My drink came large bottle of mineral water with no straw and no glass - had to request a glass. Tried to serve one wrong meal so had to wait for new meal to be prepared. No cutlery on the table and waitress did not even notice when she put meals down. So we had to request cutlery. Food was tasty but service ruined the lunch
5
This place is great. Dont leave singapore without a visit. it is pricing but anything that isnt singapore chicken rice is expensive in singapore. Lunch Sunday brunch or dinner you hvae to go.
4
This is my favorite place in Singapore for food. It is worth trying any of the meals in the menu. It is for sure the best burger I have ever eaten in Singapore.
4
Food was great - still best fish and chips I have had in Singapore. Steaks looked great and the menu is very diverse ( my friend is Veggie and normally doesn't get a choice) Would have given it 5 but the one in Dempsey Hill was a bit disappointing in comparison. Had a great time at the one near Club Street though. WIll return and would recommend :)
3
But if you are an expat and craving western food this may be the place for you. Stick to the simple stuff e.g. burgers and club sandwich. Lovely setting overlooking the jungle. Very busy and no reservations for breakfast or lunch on the weekends. Beware if you sit outside as the patrons are allowed to smoke very close to where you eat
5
My husband and I had dinner here last Friday 26.10. Menu is excellent, with veg and meat options. Wine list also very good. Service was attentive and friendly. Lovely, informal venue with plenty of character and good options for outdoor/indoor sitting. Simply perfect for an informal candle light dinner, an evening with friends or a brunch with family
4
Food is always superb and a good price and good size portions, service unfortunately can be patchy and most times you may have to ask a few times for water refill, or to take your desert order. Fine if you are not in a rush, but can be a bit frustrating
2
Came to PS for some brunch and studying. The cafe's surroundings are nice and the inside pleasant. Was lucky enough to grab a seat without a reservation on Sunday afternoon (recommend you make one!).On to the food: truffle fries, latte's, caesar salad and eggs florentine. Truffle fries are good, but could use more than the ever so slight hint of truffle oil. Eggs florentine were quite solid except for one cardinal mistake: poached eggs are not exactly supposed to have firmly solid yolks. The caesar salad was pretty poor: same problem with the egg as above, too much dressing and the honey-dijon chicken -while flavorsome- tasted like plain lemon. The homemade croutons in it were fantastic and it has generous amounts of gran padano, definitely not parmesan. Latte was nothing special. Bill for this: 94 SGD, which does not remotely reflect the quality of the food. Making poached eggs with solid yolks is something a place of this standard cannot afford to do (and from a cooking perspective isn't difficult enough to be forgivable). Service is perfectly acceptable, nothing to mention in either a negative or positive sense. An okay experience but won't come back. The actual rating would be 2.5/5, but for the failure of making poached eggs properly (0 out of 3 right) PS does not get the benefit of the doubt
3
It has been 3 years since i last ate here and i believe standards have dropped. I vaguely remember having a decent lunch including truffle fries and so i returned to try and relive the moment. We only decided to have the fries and drinks this time and it was off putting enough. Our truffle fries had the hint of truffle, but it wasn't as divine as i remembered it. Not sure if they cut corners since. My iced ginger tea was plain bad, it tasted like water, and it was $7 bad. My friend had their cafe latte and it was bad too, according to him. Probably not return as there are too may options in 1 cit
4
Busy as usual, this place is good for quite clam romantic dinner or having a business conversation. The food is good, chef can alter there menu as per your liking. The drinks menu is good and their is great wine list.A caution for ppl who like to sit outside beware of mosquitos A thumbs up for food and ambiance but be prepared to shell out at least sgd 50 per person with one drinks
1
I was at PS Cafe to read and enjoy some deserts. My daughter and I was told 1.5 hours before they close for dinner that we have 1.5 hours to go before we have to leave. I was about to pay and leave anyway, but if I had paid S$60 for desserts and coffee, I just want to hangout. I do expect to be told to leave, not 1.5 hours before dinner time. PS Cafe has to be careful what messages they are sending to their customers! This is not the first time. Very off putting
4
We went there with the family, for a lunch. Medium/high priced, fresh and very varied plates. the truffle fries are very tasty, but a tad on the greasy side. Must try the date pudding!
4
The ps cafe is the benchmark restaurant in Singapore showing off both creativity, and skill. This restaurant makes great salads, and even better pastries and deserts.
4
PS Cafe at Dempsey is a lovely place to visit on your weekend - although quite busy! The food was just ok, but the surroundings are absolutely lovely.
5
Good selection of food here, from simple snacks to huge meals. Cafe on Orchard is great escape while shopping. The one at Dempsey Hill is great for a Sunday lunch or post lunch deserts.
4
What a setting. Jungle, old military barracks, balmy, frogs croaking in the background, delightful food; great fish and chips; stunning wine list and desserts. Many an evening has been had here with family and friends.
3
went for lunch at the Paragon branch. seating was a little tight. you could hear your neighbours talking. the food was delicious and the selection of tea superb. a little pricey for lunch though
4
A "must go" for expats who want a nice lazy brunch in a great environment. You usually have to wait a bit on a Sunday morning but that is fine. Get there early if you can. The service for Singapore is good and the coffee is one of the best in town. The downside is that it is pretty expensive for what you get..
5
Went to PS cafe on Saturday morning for brunch, as expected we had to wait for about 15 minutes. On settled in, I opted for a poached egg and truffle fries. Both were excellent in term of quality and quantity, just what we want on Saturday morning. The garden view was also complimenting with tall window glass. After such a good experience, I went back again for more during my next SG visit
5
The food drinks and staff are always nice at PS Cafe. I very much like the interior and exterior design and it always helps a when you have a marvellous garden view. I've been here some times now and it is one of my favourite spots to sit down and relax whilst enjoying your simple lunch or dinner. Value for money and quality
3
Somehow, I can always find something delicious at Paragon. At Palais Renaissance, it's always a bit disappointing and at Dempsey, it was pretty vile. They have the edge on truffle fries though. The daily specials are not particularly good valus and are very hit or miss
4
Its a good brunch place. Good ambiance, quality of food is great. but it doesn't come cheap. For two people you will already spend $60 and up
5
Good chicken fingers, fries, and root beer float. Other people with me enjoyed their meals. Nice bathrooms, too.
4
Very nice and scenic place to have breakfast. Prices are too high, service is volatile and can be really bad. Guess people don't come here for the food. Big Ang Moh hangout on weekends.
3
Visited PS Cafe Harding several times and must say the main draw is the greenery, the setting and overall ambience.
Great place to while away a few hour with good company and a few drinks and some pricey food.
5
Love the food, love the desserts and the interior and surrounding are just right! a great place to dine or just have coffee, i highly recommend the date cake and truffle fires!
5
Great weekend brunch place, great fit out and lovely food. The one at ASH Park does not allow kids so pick this one if that suits.
5
We went there for brunch but we had to wait for about 10-15 minutes for the seat outside. Yes, pick the seat outside. The view was gorgeous. We sat quite at the back and we couldn't see the road, surrounded by big trees. The service was very nice. The water was free! I just love this part. We had one waiter who doesn't speak English somehow, maybe he was just a trainee. We had steak sandwich, PS burger, and chicken with pasta (I forgot the name, sorry!). Everything was great! However, it was quite expensive. But I guess it's the price you pay for the place and the big portioned food. I would come here again in a heart beat (and after pay day)
3
Went back here again (ASH) and while it still looks great and the roof top bar is cool, the food has become very average and overpriced. Crab-cake starter - one tiny crab cake for $20 is a rip-off. The lamb was very nice but at $42 you'd expect it to be. Service needs brushing up - the waitress took our cutlery off the starters plates and put them back on the table. Fine if you are in some cheap place but not here, especially when there is still food scraps on the cutlery. Still, a beautiful restaurant and I'll probably be back to give it another chance. Good luck

PS Cafe is very much overpriced (as are so many restaurants in Singapore). Everything on the menu is somewhat bland. If you're really craving western food, then this would be a good place to go because the western food in Singapore is not very good. But I am a little surprised that a bland menu like this can command the prices that it does. Best think I have had on the menu so far is the burger and truffle fries. All their restaurants are beautiful though
3
I have been a few times as people like to meet there. Apparently it is somewhat cosmopolitan.I wasnt impressed by the service (which has improved after a few newspaper articles in rudeness). The food was the type you would expect in a dinner in the desert in the US.I simply dont see what the hype is about
5
Great menu, excellent service, like a good French restaurant should be. Reasonably priced, so overall pretty good value for money especially in Singapore where you generally get bad service for ridiculous prices.
4
Lovely ambience and atmosphere and always crowded. Service tends to be very slow in all the PS cafe branches I've frequented especially at Dempsey. But food is good and very sizeable, making it a good place to hang out with friends.
5
This is THE place to eat brunch or lunch in Singapore.
love love love it.
ambiance is good, service great and food always tasty and good value. Couldn't reccomend any higher.
4
Went there today and loved the atmosphere and food but the service was poor. We needed to ask to have our order taken, one lunch came out 10 mins before the others and the credit card was a long time being returned with the bill. It would appear that they are so busy taking bookings that they don't have time for the guests who are already in the restaurant. However, the food is very good and the prices reasonable. Not sure if I will try again or not as I hate waiting for service. Excellent bloody berry though
5
This is one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore. It has great food, a good selection of all types of food (from Burgers to Curry). I like the Dempsey Hill location better. It has a much nicer atmosphere. But the food is great at both locations. It is also very reasonably priced for a nice restaurant (SD$15-$25 for an entree). The only downfall is the service is not the greatest, but i have gotten used to this in Singapor
4
If you go after rush hours it is perfect to eat or have a drink since it is easy to find a table and it is not so crowded. We could eat outside, in the terrace, and it does not even seem to be in a typical Singaporean mall. The food is good and you have also a quite wide choice (also for drinking, fresh juices, etc). The portions are big. Service is very good as in all Asia. The atmosphere is nice. It is close to the Thai embassy. Prices are average
4
Was brought here by a friend of a friend, who was nice enough to drive us. Got a table right away on a Friday night. There were more people waiting for a table while we're there. The truffle fries are a must try (don't order anything else with fries because it was quite a huge portion) as well as the date pudding with butterscotch sauce topped with vanilla bean ice cream
4
Taking a break from hustle and bustle, you could enjoy your weekend brunch with family and friends in this floor to ceiling full-glassed restaurant in Dempsey. Quality food and big portion. Professional staff service. Recommended for couples, family and friends gathering! P.S: Just a little drawback, it's a bit of noisy when near afternoon. Advisable to reach earlier
4
I come there mostly to show our friends who were visiting us and they love the atmosphere+ the food. About the Service is quite significant as i worked for F&B back in Jakarta. It is nice restaurant and it isn't cheap place, so we expected to get good service as well. One of the time we were there too early for dinner, we arrived at 5.40pm and the staff simply just said "we aren't open yet" and walk away while i saw many other people there. I guess they were still there after their brunch! My opinion they can suggest us to have a drink until it open anyway all other guest were there. The last time we were there i had Egg Benedict, my husband and our friend had Burger, even though the service isn't that great we'll always comeback for the food and the atmosphere but will be even better if they can improve their service!!
4
This place is one of my favs for its ambience but I must say that their service staff needs to be more personable.. what I find therefore is that the experience tends to be cold, and that leaves a bit of a bitter-sweet aftertaste especially if the food and ambience was otherwise good. The deserts are a bit over-priced however, in my view... It would be better if they could moderate the prices of their cakes (or give smaller portions! or serve them without the ice cream..) a bit..
3
Definitely a go too place for brunch but too crowded! Not great service but some tasty menu items in a great venue.
5
Excellent food, beautiful environment, delicious desserts ... a must lunch or dinner place in Singapore out of the tourist track
5
this place has all round great food. Especially the cakes! they are divine.
4
Love the decor, appreciate the good service and of course the food had always not disappointed me. Waiters bend backward to make changes to the way the food is prepared to please customers. Ingredients taste fresh. Particularly like the branch at Palais Renaissance.
4
Make sure you make a reservation,else you gotta wait forever. Ambiance is really cool and cozy,food nothing impressive rather than the price. So if u decide to go there spend as much time there enjoy the drinks. Good place to chit chat with friends!
1
Not worth wasting time on. So many better places to visit. But the expat yummy Mummy's still flock with their broods
4
PS cafe is set in a beautiful location. It's best to sit outside as the inside of the restaurant can get quite noisy when it's busy which it usually is. The food is modern and very large servings. It is a little on the expensive side but the service is excellent. Would recommend this restaurant for a large gathering or a dinner for two
5
I visited PS Cafe with my family on a Sunday Evening for a casual meal. Whilst we had not made a reservation we were early enough (open at 6.30pm for dinner) to grab a table outdoors. The menu has a great many choices all of which sounded sumptuous. The five of us all managed to select something we found appealing and the meals all arrived relatively quickly. The meals were all served together, were fresh and hot. Meals are not cheap, ranging from $ 25 to $ 30 for a main (++) however there were all very tasty and left no room for desert. Drinks were also a little pricey with even a coke costing $ 8. For a family of 5 (2 Adults & 3 Teenagers) with a main meal and a drink each, the bill was just shy of $ 220 with taxes. Whilst we cannot afford to come too often we will certainly be back to taste the cakes
4
Ok so dont go to this place expecting anything brand new, they are not trying to reinvent the wheel here. But what you will get is a very good quality meal, served in a nice atmosphere with good service, the prices are not over the top for what your getting so sit back and enjoy a good burger/steak/pasta dish with some great truffle fries on the side, have a few good drinks enjoy the nice looking clientele and off you go. There is an old uncle down the hill who will sell you some good Durian nearby if you wish to try out the local delicacy after. Enjoy
5
My husband and I must visit PS Cafe at least 3-4 times in a month, if for nothing else but to have a cup of coffee and a cake. Our favourite location is PS at Dempsey, followed by the one at Palais Renaissance and then the cafe in Paragon. I havent been to their restaurant in Ann Siang Hill yet. The food is always outstanding - everything i've had, including their salads is good. Portions are sizeable, so bewar eif you're a small eater like me. Their desserts will knock you out, including the Chocolate Knockout cake which should be attempted only with 2-3 people to share with. We will never tire of going to PS
5
I have never been disappointed with any of the ps cafes in Singapore. A regular place to meet for lunch.
4
great spot at Dempsey with good food, service and ambience. a favourite place for Sunday brunch
4
A friend took us to take a brunch in the PS Cafe, the place is so cozy and nice, the food was delicious. The price is normal for Singaporean standarts, but expensive for many other countries, go early or expect to be in a queu.
4
In Singapore you can dine for any amount, even just 4 dollars at some food courts. PS Cafe is quite pricey, you can easily spend 60-80 SGD just for a brunch, but the quality is really good. Once should be tried.
4
Food is consistently good and the desserts are to die for - ambience is usually very good (casual with a buzz) and service ditto. Its not cheap but you usually have a good time with little or no complaints. I recommend it.
1
On a Sunday at 12:15 I went with my girlfriend there to have brunch and I had to meet some friends at 14:00. We arrived to a huge que and we were advised taht we had to wait for 20 minutes in order to be seated. We walked around the establishment and I counted at least 7 empty tables so I asked if it would be possible to seat at a table instead of standing and they claimed that they had the tables empty so we could be served better...2 coffees, a burger and eggs benedict where served at 13:30 (75 minutes since getting there)...so I had to rush in order to make it for my 2 o clock appointment. I do not mind paying 100 SGD for breakfast but at P.S cafe on Dempsey never again. They need to get a maitre to run the place, and not amatures
4
For the first time went to PS on AS Hill today and loved it from the start. As it was Sunday we had to wait for a few minutes but we were then swiftly taken to our table. We had the breakfast sandwich (croissant w/ fried egg, bacon, tomato, gruyere, avocado, spinach), the big bacon and eggs and truffle fries. Big enough portions so we could have done without the fries. Both dishes were fantastic with excellent attentive service and calming classical music in the background but unfortunately quite high prices (15dollars for fries..) Including a cappuccino and fresh OJ the bill came to 88dollars. It won't stop me from coming back but I won't have my eggs here every day.All in all, highly recommended for food and service just be aware of steep price
4
Unfailingly measures up every time we visit - at least once a week! - both in food quality -- food recommendations -- service staff. The owners have insured the service staff have been adequately and well trained - some of the best service of any restaurant in Singapore. We love the place -- four star rating for this restaurant/cafe is only because prices have risen and it's becoming a bit expensive to visit weekly. Highly recommended. Try the truffle fries ;-
5
We visited here during a recent trip to Singapore. It's a spacious cafe / Bistro style restaurant the time we visited we didn't have much of a line to wait in however I have heard that due to its popularity the line can get lengthy although it goes down quickly. We went for Sunsay brunch and boy oh boy was the food good. The special that day was egg benedict with smoked salmon mmmmm. There was also a wide ranch of other equally delicious dishes on offer. Service was excellent and with a smile. Overall I highly recommend the PS Cafe although it won't be the cheapest meal you'll buy in Singapore its up there with the best
4
If i'm not mistaken they have 4 ps cafe in singapore, and my fren told me this is the best by location..I go there by taxi, and u must tell the driver that it's on dempsey hill cuz they got dempsey road too, so it's kind of confusing if u never go there..Let's talk about the food first, The portion is big, and if u don't feel really hungry, u could share 1 portion for 2 people..My fren said the penne is so-so, but their rib goooodd yummy..For desert try their double chocolate blackout something, really delicious..The price for me is standard if u think about singapore, still makes sense..I prefer the outdoor area, somehow give me a romantic yet cozy feeling.. XD Service is good, the waiter is nice and friendly..One thing to keep in mind, it's hard to get taxi from this area, u must text the taxi to come, cuz the location is quite far from the main road.Apart from that, everything is fine
4
Really great food and the building is set in a nice, green setting, making out-door dining a pleasure. Save room for desert! One is usually enough to share with two. The steak sandwich is really good, but every day entrees are updated and good.
5
I love their french fries which are served with truffle oil. And their hamburgers are large and super tasty. But, be forewarned...they are not cheap!!!
5
The green surroundings are very inviting. Great place to go for coffee, for those with a sweet tooth raging out of control...try their luscious fudge brownie.
5
went to the china town one. great food. great service
4
We like returning to PS Cafe @ Dempsey village once in a while because it breaks the monotony of eating either at hawker centers or upmarket restaurants at MBS Singapore. The food is always fresh because of good turnover each night especially at the weekends and we love their generous portions of caesar salad with prawns or chicken and an egg just poached right. The dessert of ginger creme brulee is the family's favourite. BTW, you may bring your dog and probably its the luckiest patron who gets to sit on the lush green grass while you sup on comfy benches outside. Thanks
3
I may be jaded on this one in that it was one of my first Singapore restaurants. But I felt it was overpriced (and I wasn't even paying). The truffle fries are adored by many, but for me were over the top and typical of the Singaporean thing to add truffle into any dish! The ambience was very nice (we were at Duxton Hill) and service was good too.
4
I have been to the PS Cafe many times, as the atmosphere is nice, the menu is decent, and the staff is friendly. This is a good place for a business meeting, as the "ladies who lunch" provides nice distraction from any serious discussion. At lunchtime, I would estimate 90% of the clientele is female. The miso cod is excellent; the wine list is good
4
The only reason why we don't come here more often is because it's difficult to get seating on the weekends. I also wish they served breakfast during the week. My favorite outlet is the one in Palais as it's walking distance to my home but the one in Dempsey also has a relaxing, green atmosphere
4
A wonderful location with a broad brasserie type menu. Food quality is excellent, service excellent and most important of all is that you are in a tranquil cafe style environment that is pure relaxation. My two visits have been for brunch and now I plan to try an evening and longer session to relax and enjoy food, company and wine.Well worth a visit
4
Great food, not overly complicated or pretentious. Hot, tasty, served efficiently in a contemporary, cool environment.The tastiest water ever...infused with carrot,celery, mint and apple..wierd yet refreshing.My friend had the bolognese, which had lashings of what looked like a piping hot, moist, tasty beef ragu. I had the French fries with truffle oil. 600gms is a single portion HUGE. Crispy, hot and tasty. I also had the Ceaser Salad, great dressing and again a huge portion.The star of the show was the best Keylime Pie I have had outside of the USA. Zesty, creamy and unctuous. Served with Illy coffe
4
yummy food in an airy environment. even the tap water is yummy (as it's got celery & carrots in the water jug)
2
It's not exactly terrible, but definitely not the first choice of hangout for me and my clique. The food is normal and expensive. Patrons talk loudly and you could barely have a proper conversation with your friends.
4
It is often very busy but the food is good, portions are quite big, love the chicken caesar salad and the french fries with truffle!
4
usually good locations, Ann Siang Hills or Dempsey Park for instance, an equal quality service and food. Too bad you can't book for brunch...
5
Lovely setting, great menu and food, service is generally rubbish but we are in Singapore so we shouldn't expect food to turn up hot or at the same time!
Personally I also like it that no children are allowed in the restaurant!
4
From the moment you enter the restaurant, you will notice this is definitely going to be different from the norm. The decor is excellent and the service too!
2
I have been to most of the PS cafe in Sing. The coffee is worse than those in a fast food chain, however, the price is of course double. Skip the coffee. If you are bringing your kiddos, also give this cafe a miss. It is totally unfriendly towards children, esp the one that is located @ Dempsey. Totally disappointed with the staff of PS Cafe.
5
I've visited every single PS Cafe in Singapore and love them all. The one on Ann Siang Hill is probably the most beautiful one. Great to have lunch and a refreshing home made lemonade after a stroll and souvenir shopping in China town. Palais on Orcard Rd has a very calming atmosphere, so this location is great to hang out while shopping. PS cafe at the Paragon Mall is the original one, but very small and you're really sitting in the mall. This was my least favorite. And then there is Harding close to Dempsey Hill which has a beautiful terrace. This is probably the best PS to have dinner. Want to know our favorite dish at PS? check it out at http://www.fishandfeathers.nl/food/double-chocolate-black-out

I used to eat in the PS Cafe regularly back in the mid-2000's, and came back in 2012 to find it much the same in terms of food quality, though much busier than I had ever seen it. I see they have multiple outlets now, but I returned to Harding Road where I always used to go, and enjoyed excellent quality food once again. The service at this place has always been slow, and as it's got busier, the service has got slower. Personally I don't mind that, since I think a meal out should be a leisurely affair, but many people don't think that way. Basically, if you're looking for a quick in and out meal, don't come here.I was pleased to see a lot more Singaporeans than I ever used to. Back in the day this place was pretty much crawling with expats, but now there seems to be a good mix of expats and locals, and it's the better for it in my opinion.We went for brunch, and there is a good menu of brunch type items. Highlights are the deserts however. They have a great selection of deserts and cakes, and I've never had a bad one
3
I think there are 4 or 5 outlets now, have been to most. The ambiance is a bit different in each, I like the one in Dempsey. The food is always good. The service is kind of hit or miss depending on how crowded they are. The one thing is simply sticker shock. $22 for a burger? I don't think there is anything on the menu for less than $18. It's a nice place to go out for brunch with friends, food is consistent, drinks are decent, desert is a bit over the top - again, $15 for a piece of cake. I don't mind shelling out money for good food, but for slightly above average, this is way over priced
4
There are a number of branches, but I would recommend the one in Dempsey Hill as the location is really pretty. A great place for brunch. Also like going there for dessert. Australian style food.
5
the coffee and dessert are amazing! and the one at Dempsey is best place for breakfast on Sunday morning - make sure you come early, otherwise, you would have to wait to get a seat (not sure if they take reservation for Sunday bfast)
5
Have visited the PS Cafe in both Orchard Rd and at Dempsey Hill and can vouch for both as being an excellent place to enjoy brunch, however I have never had an evening meal so cannot comment on that menu. Both facilities have a wonderful layout and well trained staff which lend to a enjoyable experience
5
tried all 4 locations and their decor are superb, attention to details. their harding one at d. hill are pretty amazing both in-door an out-door. but their waiters at palais looked pretty sad to me, never wear a smile at all.must try their huge brownie with ice-cream, suitable for 2 than 1. yummy :-
3
This restaurant essentially provides food of the brasserie type variety, with an Australian/ West coast USA leaning. All dishes are tasty, servings are of suitable size, and their cakes/ deserts are even huge. The setting is pleasant and, for Singapore, unusually green. Nevertheless, it is one of those places that are just not so special that you would want to spend the time and money to specifically get there, unless you are in the area anyway
4
Took my parents here who were visiting from the UK. Getting to the rooftop bar is a bit of a struggle if your parents are a bit elderly but great city views once you are up there. Food is of a high standard and the service was very good. The whole restaurant has a very French feel to it, all dark with white tiles. The massive flower vases get in the way a bit though. Thoroughly recommended
5
one of my favourite places to go when i'm looking for good food and a quiet time. truffle fries are superb, so is the wagyu burger and of course the desserts (: haven't tried everything yet but i love the golden banana butterscotch.also love their sangrias! definitely one of the best i've had.portions are HUGE, ideal for sharing (especially if you have an asian appetite like me).service is prompt and attentive.i've been to all ps cafe except harding road and my favourite is the one at palais
2
We've tried going to the Chinatown location of PS Cafe several times for lunch and dinner. They have a great looking roof top seating area - great looking from the outside because we've never actually been able to sit there. Every time we try it's either closed, full, or not serving food. We've tried booking in advance and we've tried just showing up - but no luck either way. I've tried asking the staff what their policy is about the rooftop seating area, but I never get a straight answer. It's a shame and a waste of a great space
5
PS Cafe's are consistently providing some of the most pleasant eating experiences in Singapore. Whether it be from the bustle in Paragon through the laidback chic of Palais to the not so tranquil jungle at Dempsey they turn out a superb standard of unfussy great quality food and drinks backed by usually bright, enthusiastic and informed staff. They are without doubt my default eating establishments in town......if you want to impress and chill with visitors to town take them to one of these outlets they will not let you down
5
They have several locations around town although I've only been to the one in Dempsey Hill. Great food with several options for vegetarians. Their desserts especially the Chocolate Pecan pie and Flourless Orange Cake were incredibly delicious! Very generous portion sizes! Service is a tad slow and I didnt care for their truffle fries. All in all, I would definitely go back there again.
4
The food is good but not outstandig, portions are enormous, which makes it good value for money. The location is great, atmosphere nice and in the evening gret cocktails. Overall good place to go.
4
we went there one sunday morning around 11ish, had to queue up for seats!! Ordered truffle fries/burger and cakes to finish off. I really have to say the food tastes extremely tastety esp fries. All in all, worth a visit but pricey
5
This is a hidden gem -- a few minute cab away from hustle and bustle of Orchard Rd, but you feel like you're away from it all. Ask for a table outside -- when it's dark, the lanterns and greenery create a very charming atmosphere on the porch. Simple, yet delicious food, and impeccable service. Friendly staff. There's also a cozy area on the porch with lounge-esque chairs for a quiet glass of wine
1
My first time at this PS Cafe address, with friends. I have been to the other PS Cafes and this has got to be the worst experience.The waiters (every one of them) who came to take our orders, bring us our food and drinks, and clear them, insisted on stretching across the table instead of walking around it. Each time they came around, all we saw in front of us was arm-pit and half their torso reaching over the table. We thought initially, that it was just the first waiter, but one after another, each one that came to our table, did the same thing over and over again.When our dessert arrived, I stopped the waiter, telling him to go around. He looked at me as if I was explaining quantum physics to him then promptly stretched over the table (again) and placed the plate with my dessert down, this time, in front of my friend! Really annoyed at this stage, I asked him if he had hurt his foot? Asking if that was why he just couldn't walk 1.5m around the table? He said, "YES!" then walked off! Then I noticed that at a table nearby, someone had left their sunglasses and cell phone on the table. I asked for the manager, thinking that I'd ask him to keep it, in case the person returns for it. A guy came over and said that there was no manager, and asked if he could help me, so I told him about the phone and glasses and I hope it's not gone "missing".Overall, the food quality was pretty ordinary - nothing to write home about. I ordered the rib-eye and it was on the turn. Not quite off yet, but definitely mildly funky. They've also given new meaning to sticky date pudding - the new meaning being, drowned date pudding.The price for the steak on the menu, before tax and service charge was SGD34. Now this is neither cheap nor expensive, but c'mon, that doesn't give them the right to serve up something that's not fresh! I've always enjoyed my meals and drinks at the PS Cafes at Paragon and Ann Siang, but if you're going to this one at Harding Road, just remember that you'll be paying for subpar food quality, poor service and some amazing attitude! This one's officially struck off my food list when I'm next in Singapore
2
the place is packed. the waiters is always busy. the size? big portion. enough for two, and so is the price. I mean, I can do bread eggs and bacon at my own without spending $22... and the taste is ordinary. nothing special except they top those with asparagus garnish and mushroom.iced water with mint and lemon flavor, can do on my own too... overpriced, slow service, average food taste.would not come back.pineapple pie was quite good though.

For more reviews visit: http://wanderlustannamolly.wordpress.com/2011/10/20/a-saturday-in-the-park/In search of some greenery and away-from-home experience? P.S. Cafe at Ann Siang Hill is one of the top picks for me.I found myself there this weekend just past and I love the lush greenery that surrounds this little shop house. The fact that its housed in a shop house doesn’t hurt. Entry into the cafe takes you up a flight of stairs through Ann Siang Park and you almost feel like you’re shedding the bustling roads of Singapore, thrown into a peaceful wonderland before you hit the landing and are welcomed by the familiar black and white checked tiles unique to the P.S. Cafe chain.I’m no stranger to P.S. Cafe, frequenting the outlets at Palais Renaissance and Dempsey but the Ann Siang Hill branch is unique. For one, they bar the entry of children below the age of twelve. I do not have issues with children but the ambiance sans the shrill trills of active children does make a world of a difference.Chow wise, P.S. Cafe has never failed to satisfy and here’s a low down of the calorie-laden brunch we inhaled.Starting with a side, the Foutine was crisp, savory comfort food created to satiate most. The shoestring fries were infused with truffle oil and were crisp perfection, good enough on their own if you ask me. Enhanced, the fries were tossed with foie gras, mixed shrooms, red wine jus and swiss cheese. We couldn’t detect the swiss cheese in the final mix but that red wine jus-foie gras-shrooms mix was lip-smacking goodness.Having had laksa for breakfast and absolutely craving nothing but armed with an insatiable appetite, I decided to let the one with the craves do the final orders and the mains were decided as such – Breakfast Sandwich, House Bolognaise and Big Bacon & Eggs on Toast. The Bolognaise, pictured above turned out to be the charmer for me that noon.Starting with the breakfast sandwich, it is what I would call a nourishing meal. Simple, everyday ingredients chocked full with nutrients and freshness presented on a plate for consumption. Starting with the base of a well-made croissant, a layer of well toasted bacon starts the sandwich off. Generous slices of avocado [my favorite buttery indulgence] follows and is topped with beautiful ripe slices of tomatoes, leafy green spinach and perfectly blanched asparagus. Another layer of bacon tops the greens and is followed by one of my favorite proteins – eggs, the yolk still runny. The sandwich is then finished with melted gruyere and the sandwich is toasted before service. A mess on the plate and in the hands but a symphony in the mouth.The house bolognaise is comfort food plus. We’ve all had our fair share of pseudo-bolognaise where the tomato sauce is weak and bland, leaving little appetite to stomach yet another forkful. Well this tomato sauce is at the opposite end of the league. Rich, flavorful, sweet even with generous chunks of ground beef and bacon, leaving you craving for the next forkful. The spaghetti is well-tossed and every strand of the pasta was well-coated in the bolognaise. The flavor of this comfort dish was further enhanced with generous shavings of parmesan and topped with crispy basil leaves. This is one dish I would definitely return for brunch, lunch or dinner just for a pick-me-up.Our little savory dig-in is wrapped with the big bacon & eggs on toast combo, your typical breakfast find. The elements I really loved were the smoked bacon and pesto button mushrooms, but again, I’m a HUGE fan of pesto so take my word with a pinch of salt. Every element on the plate gelled seamlessly together and made for what I would call a breakfast of satisfaction.No meal is complete without dessert where I’m concerned and since my introduction to lemon based desserts in London, courtesy of Gordon Ramsay, I’m on the search for the best lemon desserts in the +65. So with no hesitation, I declared my desire for the steamed lemon cake. This was faced with mixed reviews at our table. I loved the citrus flavor that permeated the lemon custard sauce the steamed cake was bathed in and did not like so much the vanilla bean ice cream that topped the cake as it was a tad too creamy for my liking. My pals on the other hand loved the ice cream that topped the dessert and one of them found the lemon custard a tad too tart for her palette. As with everything, it is subjected to personal preference.Sorbet was craved at the table but denied due to unavailability and we were sorely disappointed but not disheartened with an order of the burnt peach ice cream, a special on the day of visit. Again, I have issues with anything too creamy so this dessert does not get top marks from me as I found it somewhat cloying and far from refreshing which was what I was craving from that missing sorbet order. What I did love was the infusion of the burnt flavor via the caramel crisp that accompanies this dessert.So if you’re craving some good chow and a little taste of the great outdoors without actually being outdoors, do head on down to P.S. Cafe at Ann Siang Hill for a retreat you will not regret. I couldn’t help but snap a few pictures under the vines after, I’m sure you would too

I went to the establishment in Ang Siang Hill. First impressions were excellent, its a nice looking place, lovely ambience, great location. However I was let down by the food (very tough steak, no side dishes) and the speed (mains took 1 hour to arrive). We were with a work group so perhaps the large group of 20 caused an issue, but for the prices changed (steak was 60 to 80) I think it needs to improve
5
I highly recommend the outlet at Palais Renaissance, Orchard Road. I love the atmosphere. The recipes are also very good, and the chefs try and have interesting hints of flavors as one savors the food.I can't say I recommend the Dempsey Road establishment, especially on weekends. I find the atmosphere is marred by all the posers and noise...

My PS Cafe of choice would always be Ann Siang Hill, mainly for the fact that it doesn't allow children under 14 to dine there - heaven!It is the perfect place to meet friends for a civilised brunch at the weekends, to over-indulge in eggs benedict, pancakes, huge slices of freshly bakes cakes, and maybe a champagne cocktail or two. Lovely interiors, lots of magazines/newspapers to read whilst waiting for friends, and beautiful flower displays.Personally, I'm not a fan of the truffle fries (too rich), but friends love them. The portion sizes of their cakes are always huge, so maybe best to share

I visit here reasonably regularly...normally the one on Ann Siang hill but have been to the one at Dempsey as well and service varies wildly depending on which one you go to and the time of day. Ann Siang does not accept kids, so tends to be quieter on weekends, but due to its proximity to the CBD is often rammed during the week. Food is good here, but service can be erratic on the weekend...though during the week is pretty good, I guess as they are trying to turn tables. Dempsey on the other hand was a nightmare when I was there, screaming kids running round, average food And non existent service, had to ask to order, ask for drinks and then ask to pay....not great. Recommendation would be the one at Ann Siang

The cafe serves reasonably delicious but overwhelmingly pricey food. A dinner for three without wine can easily works up to $300. Not to mention the minimum spending policy adopted by the management. All these being said, the cafe is always crowded during lunch and dinner.

it was a very good experience !!! it is really expensive S$45 for dinner main course starts from S$25 TO S$40

I had a business brunch with my colleagues from Bangkok. The first impression was good until i sat down, the air conditioner was set to cold and it made our food cold. The positive aspect of the cold air was that we constantly ordered latte to warm us up. The food portion is good but we had to eat fast as it was gotten cold very quickly. the deco is nicely set up with dark wood and high ceiling. I recommended this restaurant but do bring a jacket, yes, even in Singapore.Barne

We went for brunch, although I have been before for dinner which is a little less manic! A very family friendly brunch spot....so loads of babies and noise (not so good with a hangover but nice for my friends with kids. Had the best breakfast with bacon, brioche, tomatoes etc, service could have been better but as I said, it was manic... Cakes looked gorgeous! Dempsey Hill is a nice spot with some good shops to browse in when walking off brunch

Working backward and get the good stuff out of the way. The best part about the place is the desserts. Compliment to the dessert chef. We ordered 4 different items this time; all were decadent- properly prepared with high quality ingredients. If you have a craving for pecan chocolate pie, double chocolate cake, berries tart, or passion fruit meringue, this is the place to get it. My favorite for the night was the passion fruit meringue, perfectly done meringue topped with lemon curd, vanilla ice cream, and passion fruit coulis- a combination of sweet and sour. The serving sizes was good given the price. (We have previously ordered the marshmallow chocolate brownie for a birthday parties-- very rich and quality chocolate is used.)A family of four celebrated a birthday over dinner. Managed to get reservation ahead and was told outside seating because no inside table was available. Staff need better training or management need to better coordinate with their staff. We arrived a few minutes early and was showed to an in-door table when asked if one is available instead of outside. While dining, I got call asking if we are going to arrive for dinner from another staff....??? Ah well...Now for the dishes we ordered: 1. ps burger and fries (S$28)-basic not worth the $$ 2. PS bolognaise (S$28)- too sweet, pasta seems pre prep- NOT even worth half of the priced charged- sauce is too sweet3. special of the day- steak with some sort of really sweet reduction sauce wedge potato, and asparagus-- portion was generous but $$$4. special of the day- bream (fish) with quinoa and peas-- OK for my part, do not like the pinkish cold mayo like sauce served atop; I scraped it off. Can see a complaint from someone who has a bigger appetite needing the fish to be a bit bigger for the price.  2 staff interchangeable waited on us. They looked over worked and tired. Hardly smiled. Thought they were nice and attentive. Not sure what ambience is there beside it being located in the Dempsey Hills for the asking menu price. There is no view, decor/table settings is shabby. Did not notice any avant-garde artwork or interesting wall decors of any type.We adults had a bottle of Sauvignon blanc. The kids asked for what supposed to be vanilla Sprite float. They thought they would like it, BUT it was way too sweet. Not sure what kind of ice cream was used. The kids hardly drank it. Live and learn..Total bill was about S$300Looking elsewhere for our next celebration

Not possible to make reservations. What does it mean? We were group of about 10 and they asked us to wait 60 min.Any restaurant in the world offers to make a reservation . How can you plan to have a nice time with a group of friends there? Simply impossible or you accept their unprofessional policy. Sorry PS..

I usually like P.S Cafe, but after our experience last Sunday, we will never return here again. The service (or lack thereof) was/is terrible. We had a group of 19, but the company refused to offer us a table, despite us guaranteeing to place a deposit down of $100. Since, we have had no follow up to emails or phone calls.We consequently took our business elsewhere (and the $1950 cheque!)Won't be returning to this overpriced and poor-serviced restaurant
3
Booked a table of 7 pax for 7 PM and received 3 further text messages reminding me to arrive promptly as table would only be held for 15 minutes. In hindsight rather wish i had been late.On arrival the Maitre d' station was a shambles with people who arrived on spec just milling about.We were shown to our table and handed menus - no offer or apperatif / anti pasti or even bread with oil / balsamic.After about 60 seconds a waitress arrived to take food orders - we had not even decided what to drink by this time!It just went downhill after that:Disinterested staff.Repeatedly having to ask for cutlery.Meals served staggered - at one stage deserts had been served, eaten and plates cleared whilst other members of the party still awaited their dessert.Coffee and Grappa to finish was served minus the Grappa which never did turn up.Overall mediocre food is presented from a kitchen with service issues to plate up 7 meals at the same time, served by staff with absolutely no enthusiasm for what they are doing.10% service charge is tantamount to highway robbery and was grudgingly paid.Go to Oso instead

PS Cafe in Dempsey is a very well located restaurant and if you manage to get outside seating its a great place to spend an evening with someone you love. The only bad thing about this (and all restaurants in Dempsey) is that they close kitchens quite early on weekdays, we landed up at 1030 the previous night and had to go to Clarke Quay for Dinner. However we liked the way the place looked so much that we decided to go back the next day and I would have to say that I was not disappointed. A tad expensive, like all restaurants there but a nice place to spend a quiet evening
4
Yes It may be pricy...but at least here you feel in a nice and cozy environment. Unlike almost all cafe and restaurants in Singapore located in a mall, this one really makes you feel in an international city...so in one word, i like it very much..plenty of magazine and beautiful people to starre at!!!
3
Homemade dips are fantastic, mains are great. Deserts need some work - focus on the out-of-ordinary to get the best. A bit pricey, and the furniture needs to be taller (one foot tall chairs).
5
Super charming and a perfect place for a Sunday brunch. (We went there on Easter) It was so idyllic I do not even know where to begin. It was the relaxing, chic & the food was great. The kind of dining experience I would want to have everyday for the rest of my life. A little on the pricey side but overall a fantastic experience in Dempsey Hill
4
Why mixed? We went to the one at An Siang Hill and eventhough the place is gorgeous, the ambience is impeccable and the staff were warm and charming, the food wasn't amazing (thoughly very nicely presented) considering how expensive it is. Plus, the service is quite slow.However, when we went there, the place was packed so clearly, many people love this place

Having struggled to find cafe-style places that offer good quality salads and light snacks, we stumbled upon PS cafe in Paragon some time ago and found it peaceful and offered great food.When we saw that there was a PS outlet at Dempsey Hell therefore, we were thrilled.What a disappointment. Very noisy and rowdy croud in the early afternoon, too many badly behaved kids and it took at least 15 minutes for our order to be taken.The food was OK but definately not worth $24 for a caesar salad.We had two meals , two glasses of wine and shared a dessert - the bill was $140!!I almost fell off my chair!The meal would have cost 30-40 pounds in England. As so frequently happens in Singapore, I left the restaurant feeling ripped off
1
I went to the one at ann siang hill.Ma and my colleague had the lamb and our client had the ribeye.1st the price, I was litteraly shocked.Lamb tenderloin = 42 sgd, Ribeye = 85 sgdWITHOUT TAX AND SERVICE !!!! So with all inclusiveLamb tenderloin = 49.14 SGDRibeye = 99.45 SGD(Even at Raffles Hotel Steak house it is cheaper, and the meat is prime quality there !!!!)The lamb was ok, but the ribeye was full of fat, portions of meat were just average...How a place can be so overpriced like that.I am not even starting on service....for that kind of prices you should have a good service.No further comments on those PS cafÃ©s that are all extremely expensive for a very average food.I have never been so shocked with prices like that before.it is sheer ROBBERY !!!No starters, no desserts no coffes, One of the cheapest wine on the listtotal: 351.33 SGD.........................FLABBERGASTE

A good friend of mine suggested me Dempey Hill...it is a big area full of tropical gardens with some buildings here and there now converted in restaurants. If you go there, you can walk around and pick the restaurant you like more..indian, japanese, local. I picked PS Cafe.. if you like international food it's the right place..there are tropical plants inside the restaurant and a big dessert trolley at the entrance with the most delicious 3 layers cake ever!i had delicious fries with oregano and cheese!!! deliciouuuuuuus! and last but not least, a triple chocolate cake....If you're looking for something local, maybe it's not the right choice, but if you like to go interncontinental and enjoy delicious meals it's the right place

Located in a former army barrack, PS cafe is one of the most beautiful restaurants I know in Singapore. The food and the service is simply magnificent.If you like Bauhaus or International Style atmosphere you are at the right place.The flower bouquet is remarkable.You must try the cakes. They are the best in town. Especially the Chocolate Blackout is superp. There are two branches at Orchard Road with the same standard. 1. PS Cafe, Palais Renaisance2. PS Cafe, Parago
5
We stumbled across the PS Cafe after visiting the Botanical Gardens. What a great place.The restaurant itself is in a cool, funky, sun-lit building just off the road to Dempsey Hill. It's nicely decorated and was a great setting for an early-afternoon lunch.We really enjoyed the meals we discovered while we were there. The menu was full of a wide variety of flavorful and healthy entrees, none of which disappointed. And the banana, chocolate cake we had for dessert was fantastic. All in all, we found great food, a nice setting and great people watching and liked it so much, we ate there twice during our two day stay in Singapore
5
I visited the branch at the Palais Renaissance on Orchard. As I entered the small mall that evening, the mall was dead (at 9pm), so my expectations for the restaurant were minimal. To my surprise and relief the restaurant was quite busy and I was glad I booked in advance, I would definitely recommend the outside sitting area as it overlooks the Thai Embassy garden with the a city view backdrop. The terrace area was on the corner so it had a nice natural breeze passing through it. The food was great, I started with the tasty mushroom cream soup and had the burger for my main, which was very tasty and huge

simply love the ambience of this cafe - greenhouse ambience, extremely relaxing to spend a lazy afternoon with a friend or two, or even alone with your favourite book and a cup of aromatic coffee.i met up with couple of ex-colleagues on a weekday afternoon for lunch. i must say i was extremely surprised to see the crowd in the restaurant, given that the location is abit out of the way. their ps burger was nicely done alongside with generous serving of chunky fries. my excolleagues whom had their fish and chips, sheperd's pie were on the other hand pretty disappointed with their orders. however, their truffle shoestring fries which we ordered to share as a side (highly recommending it) was extremely yummilicious! we finished off our lunch with a serving of coffee.on the whole, their food are slightly above average at least on my end, but i definitely think they are over charging for their food. but once in a while should be quite alright. i am definitely returning to the restaurant again for their truffle shoestring fries
2
Been twice and have been twice disappointed. Food is ok but nothing to write home about and the service is the worst I've had in Singapore. Twice!
3
@ Harding Rd. Nice food and ambience(outdoor), indoor is a little noisy when crowded.
3
Fun, trendy, noisy :) Good cocktails, average mains (fab truffle chips tho), great desserts!
2
Food ok only. Good ambience though.
3
Nice ambience. Great food. We decided to dine alfresco and was bitten by mosquito. Sit inside. :) Best to book in advance if you planned to go there for dinner.
4
Another very me place. Too bad the food is nothing to rave about. But I must have it's butterscotch toffee ginger pudding

PS Café in my mind over charges and under delivers.We had been frequent visitors for weekend lunches, and always enjoyed the Croque monsieur, which gave us the confidence to try dinner. Never again.The Server insisted on calling me ‘Boss’ which really grated on me, if he wanted to call me something, then call me my name, they had it on the reservation.Two of us chose appetizers from the specials of the day, and my wife just ordered a main course item with instructions to have it served at the same time as the other two entrée’s.. Guess what ! her Sea Bass arrived with the scallop starters. So we sent it back.  We asked for a seat on the outer edge of the deck, and were told the one we had in mind was reserved, an hour and a half later when we left it was still empty.. The food was atrocious and expensive. One scallop on a bed of shitake mushrooms and Nori seaweed was overwhelmed by the strong flavours and completely lost ($19.00) The Sea Bass came as a tower of food, the chef misdirected all his attention into building this edifice, and forgot to dedicate his time to balancing the flavours on the plate, so we got sickly sweet coconut and sweet potato puree over powering the Sea Bass. Could not eat it. The other entrée was the lamb of the day, actually perfectly cooked and then spoiled by an accompaniment of chick peas and a mayo based sauce more like something one should find on a picnic spread, not dinner that cost $53.00 ..oh by the way they don’t put prices on the board for the specials and the servers don’t tell you, so of course we had sticker shock as well as toxic shock leaving. Three people with the cheapest wine on the list $283.00 Not worth it

I travel frequently to Singapore and it seems that the PS Cafe has become a bit of an institution. It's one of those places that everyone talks about so one's expectations are inevitably raised and the cafe has, as a result, garnered the reputation for being over rated. I have been to all three of their locations and I think it is a good cafe, it's not groundbreaking food but it's reliable, simple cafe food, done well. Prices are similar to Australia which, when compared with hawker food, may seem expensive and bland. It is probably not a place I'd recommend to people as a 'must see' in Singapore if they were going for a short trip. It's more for the cosmopolitan locals and homesick expats. Their desserts in particular are magnificent, not in a Michelin restaurant fashion, but in a hearty, homemade sort of way, rich and more than generous servings which can definitely be shared between two - their Blackout Chocolate Cake is a must if you're a chocaholic and their cheese platter is also quite good. I would definitely recommend their Harding Rd outlet over the other two (Palais Reanissance and Paragon). The ambience, particularly at night. is lovely. As another reviewer mentioned, you feel as if could be anywhere in the world and it is really a reprieve from the hustle and bustle of Orchard. A word of warning though, make sure you know the way in the evening, some cab drivers have no idea and the place is quite hidden by all the foliage and the lighting around the Dempsey area is very poor. Definitely make a booking for Friday nights and weekends, it's always busy. The Palais cafe is alot more urban and feels a bit like the Indochine chain of bars and restaurants and the one at Paragon is definitely something I'd not recommend unless you were tired from shopping and wanted a quick bite. It is crammed in a small walkway on one of the upper floors of Paragon, the seating is ridiculously cramped and the ambience is really not ideal due to all the noise and foot traffic. Overall though, it's a nice place, worth a go if you miss cafe food from home and enjoy lush gardens (the Harding Rd one is close to the Botanical Gardens)

If you’re staying in the central core of Singapore, getting up to the Dempsey Road area is a breath of fresh air. Only about a five dollar cab ride from Orchard Road MRT, the green spaces and parkland make it feel like a taste of the countryside. In the evening, on a temperate night, you could be in Sydney, Australia, or a summery night in rural England, meaning it’s that generically park-like. There is a variety of dining options in the area, from the mundeane such as Dome to the elegant such as Rabbit Hole. I would heartily recommend P.S., which is neither simple nor Michelin. There are womb-like chairs on the deck, overlooking the park, or comfortable Eames-like chairs at classic café tables inside. The menu reads like a standard NY café, but arrives at the table with an emphasis on composition. Sometimes this succeeds, sometimes there is just too much art and not enough substance; salad greens were like air not vegetables. But if it’s substance you’re after, order dessert. They will tower over your plate, imposingly so. In general, the food is prepared very well, with wonderful turns on classic themes, and a succinct but apt drinks list. But while the food is priced, prepared and served at “restaurant” levels, the service is at a café level. So the question beckons: Is P.S. Café an over-priced café or a déclassé restaurant? You can eat in a grander, more formal, but similarly priced restaurant in a downtown hotel, but miss out on the bucolic setting. I loved the airy, open, generous space, the tasty food and friendly service. But I wasn’t sure the price warranted the final score. Maybe ten plus for brunch or lunch, and a fall-back for dinner. But a nice break from the hectic city centre for sure

Loved the Food! The poached eggs and portobello stack. Really nice natural lighting and the nice view of the greenery around it was a great brunch ambiience. A bit crowded, though - so more spaces between the tables would've been nice. Dessert was fantastic! Try the pecan pie
2
Nice environment but mediocre grub and indifferent wait staff.
4
Beautiful little place set away from the hustle and bustle. Great for brunch or an evening drink. Nice desserts.
3
decent place, decent food. nothing wow, nothing bleah
4
LURVE the place! Cosy ambience but AWFUL wait staff the last i was there.
4
if not too busy great to relax in
3
Great location but food is not outstanding. Nice place to hang out with friends for a cuppa.
3
wins on ambience hands down. lush greenery all round gives a calming effect. serves food typical of cafes. Food's just a little above average. Will return for the ambience.
3
Its nice, but doesn't quite feel like its worth the effort to get there. Pretty good service though.
4
Great place to have a meal with a group of friends. Generous with portion sizes and the food is tasty. Could be a little noisy though. Casual dining. Prices are reasonable and staff are friendly. thumbs up!
2
An otherwise lovely setting ruined by inconsistent food. The kitchen staff at the Paragon location is far better.
5
Great place for a lazy lunch at the weekends
1
Bad food with even worse service. The only thing carrying it is the ambience. For some inexplicable reason it's still packed though.
4
Nice ambience... especially in the evenings. The food s*cks but the desserts are really good. Don't waste time on the food.
1
Quite a favorite with the crowds, but I find that the service stinks. Will never go back there again.
2
Food's fairly ordinary but great place to go to people watching.
4
snooty
3
Desserts are good but forget about the mains
3
good food, good ambience in a lovely setting
4
I love the ambiance of the place! the desserts are fantastic! The double chocolate cake is my favourite - it's the ultimate for those addicted to chocolate. There's another branch in Paragon but the Dempsey branch is a romantic date place at night, especially if you stay outdoors
3
Beautiful setting but I wished that they would do something about the acoustics as the place needs some soundproofing as it's very loud indoors. I find their food slightly over the top and their salads a tad overdressed but their cakes and desserts are good (especially their sticky date pudding). I also love the way they serve their tea
3
Nice ambience but over-rated..
4
kinda pricey...but great ambience
3
love the 'jungle like' ambience plus the service... but.. slight hazard for a non pork consumer to choose from the menu.. however , the friendly crew could help to subtitute to the choice of your meat.. otherwise everything is super nice and relax..
3
Also kinda over-rated.
3
Duck Leg Rendang.
It's the only reason that keeps me going back.
Otherwise, no. Another racist place.
3
very creative & interesting food creations. My faves are the laksa pesto and the cranberry turkey sandwich
3
The ambience is fantastic, and the cakes (especially the sticky toffee) are excellent, but service can be slow and the dinner menu is limited and overpriced. Best for tea, avoid during dinner.
1
whats the hype???????
4
The mains are good, desserts are exceptional! Particularly adored the Banana Mango Crumble + Ice Cream! YUM!
4
The desserts here are marvellous! I had a chocolate pecan pie and boy, I have to say that I hadn't had such a good pecan pie in ages. The white wine sangria was also great. Portions for the cakes seem to be very generous. Make reservations to avoid disappointment. It can get crowded here
3
The food wasn't too impressive but the ambience was :)
4
Great laidback place with very decent food and desserts to boot. Gets a lot more laidback for weekend brunch, which is the best time to go, methinks.
5
Not a varied food menu, but serves quality food with awesome desserts. Gotta check out the Chocolate Blackout Cake. Drinks are good too.
4
Nice Atmosphere
3
nice ambience. Don't bother to go on saturdays as you won't really receive any service despite you paying 10% for the service charge. Waiters will claim that their food serving is for 2 but it's only enough for one male, since males have bigger appetite.
2
food's ok. Service is downright rude.
4
Execellent service. fusion food. love its ginger pudding! n the tranquil outdoors overlooking the greens.
3
Fish and Chips was quite nice but I'm more into the desserts they served!
2
Environment is good but the food and bev, so so only.
3
Be prepared for insects even when seated indoors.
4
I LOVE IT HERE! The menu is interesting with an equally interesting dessert selection. Ambience is great! Reminds me of dining in SOHO.
3
remember to make your reservation or be prepared to be booted out from your table halfway through your dessert! parking can be a headache!
3
Good Sunday hangout with friends. Good food too.
5
Really delicious brunch and superb nature decor; choose to sit indoors rather than outdoors and go in the day to fully enjoy the cool, breezy embience..never tried the dinner tho so cant say about that..
2
Food is so so but service is really bad..
4
delicious double choc cake...yeah
3
Yummy brunch. The corn blinis were something more interesting than the usual breakfast fare -- and very tasty.
4
Nice for Coffee and Cakes. The Brunch Steak Sandwich is yummy! Pricey but worth it. Ladies should share one. Guys, you definitely wont wanna share after the first bite..Ambience is nice. Sit ourside on a coold day and chill in front of the trees with Jazz playing in the background can be therapeutic for the stressed outs
3
Lovely ambience especially seeing thru the glass walls at the greenery outside. Menu is a little pricey. I don't like the concept of the today's specials written on the wall, it is confusing to me when the handwriting is non-recognizable or I had to strain my neck to look at it.The dessert portions are usually quite huge
2
i hate to be the uncool critic to say this, but it is - over rated. if decor can be eaten and ambience can be drank, this place will come up tops. where food goes? nah.. rather head down to their paragon mini-branch for a quick bite
3
Desserts r kinda nice. Wonder what they serve for dinner?
4
Good food, good atmosphere and friendly service.
Location out of the way and need to book early in advance.
3
Great for breakfast
5
A lovely and Romantic place for lovers
3
ambience very cozy
3
Nice restaurant, food hit or miss but a few pretty good dishes. Novelty factor wearing out.
3
nice place to relax but food nothing to shout about
4
very nice setting in leafy, charming dempsey hill!
3
Great ambience...food is not that good though.
4
Always good for nightcap of chocolate overload cake..
4
Love the dessert but not the crowd. Need advance booking just in case
4
Food so so, dessert is good and love the ambience
1
food is lousy. service ain't good either. i've been to dempsey so many times and this place is utterly disappointing
3
Great ambience!
4
Friendly waitresses
4
Great consistent food - good energy room - casual defiance
3
Nice place, but way too ulu for people who count on public transport.. Food is alright.
2
Cool ambience but service so-so...apparently due to over popularity...their drinks are fanciful but overpriced...becareful when order their fusion tea and stuff, taste...wierd...
3
A place for beverages & cakes; not mains though. Their Sangria, simply fabulous!!
2
Best thing going is the ambience if you get a table outside, surrounded by the trees and nice lighting. Service is lousy though, even for Singapore standards, staff being unnecessarily snooty for no reason. Food is average as is the wine list that's heavily geared twd Aussie/Kiwi labels
