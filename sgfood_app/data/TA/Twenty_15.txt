Resturent ambience was very relaxing and the food was good. Especially the pig trotters goes well paired with their HP Weiss pint. Will drop by again for another meal.

I went during the off-peak period. It's a nice place to chill, have a beer and chit chat with friends. Food is good too.

My family and I were at the Bigbox Mall and spotted a German restaurant/bar tucked away in a corner. They had the best baby back ribs ever. Their German lager was outstanding. Prices were reasonable and the staff warm and friendly. We will be back.

Where to find a place in Jurong that serve German Beer at a quite and peaceful place? This is the place Twenty 15. Plus 1 for 1 pint at $16. Don't miss it!

When we ordered garlic bread as well as French fries, the staff pointed to us that the main course that we ordered comes with fries and that bread were also be served to all of us. Hence we do not end up having with lots of bread and fries ! The staff also offered a chair for my MIL to put her. bags instead of carrying it. We were very satisfied with the other main dish that we ordered as it really tasted good. Plus there was discount from eatigo apps. So price ended pretty reasonable. Is reallly worth visiting as the service , price and food are great. I will be back

We went for friday drinks and dinner. 1-for-1 beers is a a good deal, nice german beer too. Meals were nice and reasonably priced also. We had lamb rack and a porterhouse steak. Slightly over cooked on both but it was still delicious and this didnt really ruin it for us. good service and atmosphere too, this place was perfect for what we needed

There were quite a number of diners on a weekday evening and they were there not just for the 1 for 1 beer. Most of them were dining instead of drinking even though this place is a pub. Food is pretty good, we had ribs, sirloin and ribeye. Ribs were tender with meat coming off easily. All mains were served with fries and sauted brocoli + srooms. They also have sausage platters and pork knuckles for sharing. For desserts we ordered creme brulee and choc lava cake, both were very good. I liked that their vanilla ice cream has REAL vanilla bean. Nice place, considering that nearby malls are usually jam packed

Had a casual lunch with a colleague.Had Steak for Lunch which was very nice and the Wheat Beer was very good as well.Nice services as well and happy to recommend.Could even be a business lunch as well as relatively quiet to allow conversion

My partner and I were here for a casual dinner and we weren't expecting much, given that there isn't many foodie attractions in that part of Jurong. We first knew about Twenty 15 from the groupon voucher that they were selling last Christmas. Apparently a good deal for great value (which we completely missed by the way). We decided to try it a few weeks back and did not completely agree with the reviews that we read beforehand. Portions were generous but the taste is average. The chef did try to put in effort in the arrangement and presentation of his dishes but it can be more refined
