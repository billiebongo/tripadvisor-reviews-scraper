The restaurant had been relocated to Jurong East central and can be accessed conveniently. Our family group enjoyed the dinner at this 40 years old brand restaurant. Good food at affordable price. What's more thumbs up to their service staff.

This restaurant have moved to Jurong. Tried the food there and felt that standards have dropped tremendously. Sad.
5
My title says it all - be it the oyster omelette, pork belly buns, coffee pork ribs, venison in pepper sauce or the duck - it's all delicious and hearty.I have frequented here a lot for the last 6 years (though the freq had slowed a bit since they moved from CBD to Jurong) and they quality and taste remains as good as I remember from my day 1.It's great for any occasion where you want to enjoy food with your friends, family or in groups - it's also not half bad for business lunches when people want something "locally authentic" or their is a Budget to be considered.Revisit likelihood - alway

Our family visits Beng Hiang Restaurant at Jurong East frequently for lunch or dinner. The restaurant is located above the NTUC Fairprice Jurong East (next to JCUBE). Food taste - very good and signature dishes include oyster omelette, soya sauce stew pork with steam buns and Hokkien noodles. There is no service charge at the restaurant so good savings for your wallet. Restaurant can be crowded during dinner times on weekends - do make a booking if you go there as a big group. One of our favourite Chinese restaurants in Jurong East

We have known this restaurant either formerly at Amoy St or currently at Jurong East, quite close to JCube.What's specially good value is that there is no service charge of 7%. Furthermore, if you bring your own tea leaves, the drinks are not charged either, so if you are a big family, huge savings.Our favorites are the stewed pork belly with the steamed buns and the fried oyster omelet.It's more convenient to park here as compared to the former Amoy St where there is only limited street parking. There's parking at JCube or the nearby HDB multi-storey carpark
4
went there 1 year ago however the food was horrible and it took a really long time (30 mins) for the food to be served...Decided to give it a shot again recently and improvements could definitely be seenThe food taste much better and you do not have to wait for that long (10 mins). I would go back there again if such standards were maintaine

Went back to the restaurant after almost a year. Parents were craving for the restaurant's food and hesitated for quite a while since our previous visit.So there we were at the restaurant around 7pm, and there wasn't a crowd unlike the many times we visited previously. The manageress was actually friendly and allowed a walk-in. Seems suspicious I thought, still biased against the place from our previous visit.We were promptly served and I must emphasize that there were only about two other tables in the entire restaurant. In the past, we would be served after about 10 minutes? My mother began ordering and I was expecting the same lecture-style advice by the waitress. The moment never arrived, and we were pleasantly stunned that the ordering went so well.Our tea was promptly poured and the dishes served quickly and continuously. The quality of food was exactly the same as the ones that we had when Beng Hiang was still at Amoy Street. Good old times. It was as though time stopped there, and the restaurant never moved on, serving the same food throughout the decades. This was a pleasant surprise, considering the experience we had when it first shifted to Jurong. To sum up the meal, we were given complimentary glutinous black rice and coconut. It was actually good and something that I will pay to eat.If Beng Hiang keeps up the good work, I believe that it will be a regular haunt for my family and myself

Ben Hiang offers very simple and delicious comfort Hokkein food. They are very well known to the old Hokkein community in Singapore.The stir fried Hokkein noodles, oyster cake, fried prawn roll and layered pork with steam bun are some of their signature dishes - not to be missed.The prices are very affordable too
5
Don't expect great service here but their food is as authentic as it can get!Their Hokkien Mee is their signature dish! Other than that the spring rolls and yam paste are very delicious too. Kong Ba Bao is highly recommended too.I've been eating here since I was a child and I am still coming back here after 20 years.***The hokkien mee is supposed to be watery!

Last year September, we decided to celebrate my husband's birthday at the week known famous hokkien food in Jurong East. I didn't expect not only the good became D Grade., the lady with a coat, I supposed she is the Manager or Supervisor of the restaurant. Such a big restaurant, we didn't expect such thing will happen to the restaurant. We ordered quit a dew dishes and we had our first round of the white rice. Since we ordered quite a number of dishes, we decided to order another round of white rice. But to my surprise, the waitress said they have no rice and we need to wait for another half an hour before the rice will be served. We told the lady with coat saying that when the rice cooked, our dishes will all be cold. She had no sense of appologisation. She just answered "Yes, no rice, we need to cook again, so that's why you need to wait". My husband was quite angry by the manner she answered. How can be a big restaurant like Beng Hiang have to ask the customer to wait for the rice to be cooked before they can be serve again. We informed out friends and relatives not to patronise this restaurant anymore
4
Visited the restaurant after they shift from Amoy to Jurong. The place still the same traditional Hokkien set up. The food is still nice and affordable. ðŸ˜‹
3
The restaurant has moved from Amoy street to Jurong East. Suggest that for those who drive to park at JCube next door. Traditional dishes such as fried prawn roll, fish maw soup, fried egg oyster, Hokkien Mee and Mee Hoon is recommended. The kong bak Pau is also worth trying.
1
Terrible environment that bad carpet smell when walk in the resturant. The yam ginkgo was super sweet and I worry I will have diabete. We feedback to the manager and they just say is like that!!!!!' What kind of attitude is that? Totally unacceptable !They moved from old location to Jurong east above the NTUC .... Lousy lousy , don't waste money to get upset for nothing
5
They used to be located in Amoy Street but have relocated to a building beside JCube. The setup and decoration of the place remained the same as before.We ordered fish maw soup, fried ngor hiang, fried oyster egg, kong bar bao (braised pork wrapped with steam bun), stir fried water cress, stir fried Hokkien mee and stir fried Shanghai nian gao.All the taste of the food remained very authentic as I used to remember them. It reminded me of home cooked comfort food - very simple yet satisfying.Even we ordered the dishes in small size, the portion was rather generous and good for sharing.I am looking forward to my next visit

Last Sunday night planning to go and have a look on the private room as decided might have a ROM at the restaurant, after seeing the room and menu , my family and I decided to try the food at the restaurant for our dinner. Total 7 of us called the Fish Maw Thick Soup with Crab Meat, Sizzling Bean Curd on Hotplate, Roast Spring Chicken, Coffee Pork Ribs and the so called there signature Traditional Hokkien Noodles all the dishes was disappointing especially the Traditional Hokkien Noodles is was salty and watery . At the end of our dinner while paying the bill only 6 of us having the Chinese tea and another having soft drink after explaining the bill have an error in it ,the cashiers and service staff was so rude and say that "total of 7, we will just charge as per head count" . This doesn't make an sense to me not all of us like tea and it count by per head of the table. It the end we paid and cancel the booking for the ROM cant imaging if the actual would be worst then of the service staff attitude and food quality
5
Came here with my aunt's family to for a Sunday lunch. The "Hea Cho and Ngo Hiang" was a real delight. The steam buns with stew pork "Kong Ba Bao" is also another reminder of goods from yesteryears. The yam paste dessert "orh nee" in hokkien style with corn kernels (a real delight and change from the teowchew style). The ambience offers old charm and great for family entertainment. Will definitely come back again ESP with senior family member
4
Brought mum to Beng Hiang and it was our first time there. Ordered about 6 dishes for the 4 of us. Fish maw soup was not so nice. The whole roasted chicken was very dry that day. Kong bah bao (pork belly with buns), prawns in white wine, kai lan and ghoh hiong were all very tasty. The white wine for the prawns was too little. We ordered the kong bah bao for 4 pax and there were 9 buns. There were complimentary hot red bean soup at the end of our meal. Oh, do remember that even if you don't order any beverage, they will still charge beverage per head (at the table). One of the nicer staff over there told us so. Not all the staff were friendly and courteous. We were served by 2 extremely grouchy ladies but service was redeemed by a short-haired courteous aunty. All in all, the best deal here is there is absolutely no service charge! :)
4
Firstly, you need to know that Beng Hiang is now located in Jurong East, just a 5 min walk from the Jurong East MRT station.It would seem that when it gets a bit busy, the front desk gets a bit flustered. We were standing around trying to get someone to attend to us.Once seated menus were promptly presented and food orders taken.We didn't order anything exotic. All food was tasty. I especially liked the Kong Ba Pau and the Yam dessert
5
If you ever wanted the most authentic Hokkien cuisine, look no further! They have been in business since 50 years.The senior crew is still the same and only a few of them are left. The taste of the food after they shifted to Jurong from Amoy Street, still remains the same.Their signature dishes are the steam pork with buns, hokkien mee, fried egg omelette oyster, suckling pig (have to order at least 2 days in advance), fish maw soup and the ever favorite ngoh hiang platter
5
Beng Hiang has been my favorite for many years, probably 20 years, celebrating birthdays of family members. It has moved to:Block 135 Jurong Gateway Road#02-337 Singapore 600135.A big change is parking ... parking in Amoy Street where Beng Hiang used to be is a nightmare, now there is a multi level car park in the HDB block which Beng Hiang is located.Everything else remains the same - the layout, the tables and chairs, the decorations and even the stage. Most importantly, the restaurant employees remains the same and there are more of them now plus the aromatic food.Hokkien style food remains the staple of Beng Hiang - black gooey Hokkien noodles, oysters omellette (somehow it feels better to call it oar luak), black stew pig belly ... yum yum. I am going there tomorrow, again
4
The restaurant have been relocated to blk 135 jurong gateway road.
Food was simply wonderful. Authentic hokkien cusine
Service was alright. Not the best, definitely not the worst.
5
i love eating the food here. it is a tradition hokkien restaurant that has been around for 20 years. try the ngoh hiang, prawn paste chicken, omlette and steamed fish.
4
So this place has moved completely to the suburbs. It has been around for years and years and now its in this place, in an old rundown building. It serves old hokkien favourites like ngo hiang, steamed promfret, hokkien mee etc. Good food. Kept to the traditional best. Would come if I happened to be in the neighbourhood
4
Beng Hiang had been a old favourite Hokkien restaurant for a long long time.Due to changing circumstances and rising rentals at Amoy Street. they have moved "far away "to 135 Jurong Gateway Rd #02-337 Singapore 600138. Unfortunately, this has upset some of the regulars who frequent old China Town.The owner Mr HK Ng, a successful restaurateur, businessman and philanthropist as well as an excellent Chinese calligrapher, had taken great pains to reproduce the original deco including all HIS original paintings and calligraphy. He was a graduate from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.The meals are traditional Hokkien food treasured for the subtle tastes and remembered for the authenticity. Some of the shine might have been taken off through the years, but his heart is still there.If you are lucky enough to go with regular locals, you could sample very good food for reasonable price, of course some dishes can be $$$ e.g. "the monk jumps over the wall".This restaurant is not for the demanding food in a hurry and critical ex-regulars, it is an experience for sophisticated tourists who admire and appreciate the free fine arts gallery while you enjoy every morsel and every dish.It is a feast for the mind soul and bod

In Summary:This restaurant is just a shadow of its former glory.Wishing them all the best for their business.*DETAILED REVIEW BELOW*Background:*First and foremost, the address on Tripadvisor is inaccurate. If the admins do see this, please correct it to prevent confusion. There is currently one branch in Jurong East:135 Jurong Gateway Road, #02-337, 600138*This used to be a family favourite where gatherings were usually held. The restaurant used to be at the centralized Amoy Street area but we made it a point to drop by from time to time to enjoy the food there. Food was good and reasonably priced. As of a year back, the old time favourite has shifted to the up-and-coming western part of Singapore â€“ Jurong. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly more difficult to make bookings at the restaurant and we were rejected a few times during our walk-ins. For the most recent visit, we booked two weeks in advance. 1. Service â€“ 0.1 out of 5Service was never a forte of this old time favourite. The service crew is almost certainly upset when greeting you at the door, or when you order too little or too much. They feel and look the part of parents who must tell you what to order and do. However, it has come to a new low after its relocation to Jurong. They blatantly rejected our walk-ins when the restaurant was half empty at about 7.30pm on a few occasions and we had to book very much in advance. Dishes were not served according to ordering sequence and you may get your e.g. noodles after a few other tables ordered theirs. This may be, unfortunately, 30 minutes later and this did happen to us on our most recent visit. Be prepared for waitresses who look offended when you remind them of serving the last dish and subsequently suffering from selective blindness for the next 30 minutes as they miss your waving hand for the bill, before the noodles were finally served.2. Ambience - 3 out of 5The previous restaurant, Boon Lay Raja Seafood Restaurant, used to be my familyâ€™s dinner haunt until it was bought over by Beng Hiang. Outlook-wise, it is just the average oriental dÃ©cor that typical Chinese restaurants in Singapore have. I can say that nothing much has changed since. Carpets look redder, lighting looks cheaper and more tables were placed to cramp up the main dining area. Not a place to impress your first date unless she brings her parents along and you are ready to ask for her hand in marriage.3. Cleanliness â€“ 4 out of 5It was newly renovated. Cutlery seemed recycled from the Amoy street branch, which I have no issues with as long as they are well washed.4. Taste â€“ 2 out of 5Dishes taste incredibly subdued as compared to old times. The rising cost of living in Singapore is certainly not a myth but I do not see why this restaurant skimps on basic flavouring such as salt. We started off with a mixed platter which I cannot remember if it were the Medium or Large portion. It came out looking rather Small to me though we were charged at the price of the larger portions. The prawn rolls felt much less substantial and the ingredients within were coming loose. Next up was the broccoli with fish, which tasted fine if not for its price. The fried oyster omelette came soon after and for once, we were trying hard to avoid the oysters instead of fighting for it. The omelette tasted fine though. Lastly, the flavoured pork with steamed buns came. Do note that it was the Large portion and we were charged accordingly. But the flavoured pork did not look the part and the steamed buns were sticky to the very core. My sincere apologies, I forgot about the noodles! The same way the restaurant did, or perhaps chose to, as it was more strategic on their part to cook food in batches, and even if customers have to wait another 30minutes. The noodles were strangely served cold, and ironically, was the best dish that evening. 5. Value for Money - 1 out of 5Just take your money elsewhere and enjoy an evening of better service, ambience and food
2
Beng hiang used to be my favourite chinese restaurant since the food is cheap and goodHowever ever since it moved to jurong east, the food not only tasted horrible (the buns for the kong ba bao is not even oily and the vegetables portion are pathetic) but the service was also bad (no one bothered telling us why the noodles took so long to be served)I would never go back there again unless my friends are treating me or the food is free LO
4
The restaurant replaced Boon Lay Raja at Jurong East and is not quite as good. Some of the dishes were tasty, but their signature noodles were a big letdown, being greasy and slimy. We enjoyed the watercress stir fried with dried prawns, and the pork ribs which tasted more like Chinese pork chops. They forgot our order of sizzling tofu, which proved rather salty when it finally arrived. Ngoh Hiang, another signature dish, was tasty but not exceptional. Complimentary dessert of pulut hitam was appreciated. Service was patchy, but there was no service charge
5
A fantastic place to go with your family but please book in advance as the place is packed especially during the weekend. The staff working there are mostly quite senior in age so do be patient as you wait for them to serve you. Most of the dishes are great except for the steam pomfret which is only average.
4
The restaurant was previously named Boon Lay Rajah restaurant. Every year, we come here to celebrate my mum's birthday. I remember it was still the Boon Lay Rajah last year but this year I was surprised that the name has changed. But I think the old name did not reflect her current location and some guests thought the restaurant is still at Boon Lay when it had long moved to Jurong East.My mum loves the ambience and the food here. We used to book the karaoke room and spent the night singing heartily while enjoying the sumptuous food but this year, my mother did not book the room and it seem no one book the room, I do not know why. Was it more expensive or was it that the staff could now handle the extra workloads. I found the parking at the multistorey HDB carpark was quite convenient and cheap. The parking charges for almost 3 hrs added up only to $3/-. But the available lots are mostly at the upper floors as the lower floor lots are reserved for season parking. From the adjacent block take the lift down to the second floor and you are right at the entrance of the restaurant. The name of the restaurant is also indicated beside the lift buttons. Previously , the entrance door is open but under the new management, the door is always closed. Probably feng shui is the reason.Food wise, the hokkein dishes are not bad. I have not tried hokkein noodle since the young days when my father used to buy hokkein noodles wrapped in hard white lotus leaves and I was longing to find that taste again and this time the hokkein noodles here had half of that delicious taste.The ambience here was good. The place was crowded and people were singing birthday songs loudly. The layout of the tables resembled the cha lou in Hong kong. There were artistic Chinese calligraphy on display on the walls and they really fascinated me. Price wise, I do not think it is very cheap. The ordinary dishes probably catch a cheaper rate at the CDAN clubhouse at Bukit Batok. The yam gingko nut dessert was very sweet. The fish was very fresh.We bought a birthday cake to celebrate for my mum and the staff help to cut and serve the cake and tske pictures for us. They were courteous and helpful. We gave a $10 ang pow for their assistance. Overall, we have good impression of the restaurant.

Recently visited their new location in Jurong East (previously Raja Restaurant) and the food still taste great.Love their signature dishes (egg oyster, hokkien mee, fish maw soup, yam cake....).The place is still cosy and the service is still as good as before. Love the homely feel of the place.Oh their pricing is very very afforable and 1 thing to remember is there is still no service charge and they actually provide dessert FOC.Just remember to leave a tip (all go to them) for the service staffs (most of them been with the restaurant for ages).Overall love the place, the food and the service staffs
4
Old establishment serving good Hokkien food with fairly reasonable pricing. Service is good & prompt. The suckling pig, fish & yam soup, stewed pork, steamed buns was outstanding. Keep it up!
5
Enjoyed the food... Cold dish, fish maw soup, roast chicken, oyster omelette, kong ba pau, fried Hokkien noodle..
4
business partner brought me here. this was the kick-off for bringing all our overseas visitors now here. the place gives you a feeling how things looked a couple of decades ago and this really gives it a special atmosphere. i strongly hope they gonna keep it that way!!! (ok, toilet area would be okay to have a makeover) food: excellent quality and good variety to choose. decent amount of food, pricing-wise fair. staff very friendly (especially the elderly ladies!). will be soon back
2
We went there on Sunday for diner with friends. No doubt the food is good, though I have tasted better, but when you enter the place smells like an old dump place and moldy. The decor is super retro, carpet on the floor: completely unhygienic for a restaurant, and when you go to the toilets, you will be welcomed by smashed cockroaches!! For sure a place I will never go back to !!
4
A vast hall full of those big round tables complete with lazy susans, and large Chinese families tucking in to a range of dishes - when it comes to Chinese food, Beng Hiang is the real thing. Some of the other authentic old places on Amoy St seem to have shut down (Lau Hock Kian, for instance), but this one is still going strong. Getting a table on a busy evening may be difficult if you're on your own and don't speak Chinese, but patience will eventually get you there, and it's well worth the wait.
5
Grandma wanted to treat us for dinner and I suggested going to Beng Hiang who serves authentic Hokkien food. We have 6 adults and 2 young kids.Had usual food like baby Kai lan, tofu, fish maw soup and of course their speciality, Kong Ba pao or stewed pork bun.Place is authentic and food is great. Prices are reasonable with no service charge.We will definitely visit again as everyone's happy, especially Grandma.Location is central near Lau Pa Sat so tourists should visit too. Service however was mediocre at best
4
I first visited Beng Hiang in 1987when Mr Ng ( the owner) had it located at Maxwell Road in an alley. 112 Amoy Street is more than 3 times the size but still has many of the same loyal helpful staff. Their signature dish to die for is their Hokkien Noodles which in my opinion is about the best in Singapore. Try for starters the fish maw soup, and the garlic spinach with whole garlic cloves deep fried....or perhaps their Chinese style sausage rolls in plum sauce....Although the menu is extensive you dont have to go much further than the above dishes at a table for four without feeling sufficiently and satisfyingly fed at less than S$80/-(Sept 2014) without beer or wine. The restaurant has the right Chinese ambience with scores of families and office workers fillingthe place early but there is always a spare table. Be prepared for the usual loud chatter but that is what Chinese restaurants are all about 
5
An excellent restaurant for authentic hokkien cuisine - think crisp yet juicy prawn and meat rolls (ngor hiang/hae joh), succulent braised pork belly in soft steamed buns (way better than momofuku's pork buns!), oyster omelette with fat juicy oysters, braised black hokkien noodles and many more delicious goodies. We were also given a free dessert after the meal. The restaurant was busy the night we visited (glad we made a reservation) but the service was not lacking in any way (in fact it was good for a Chinese restaurant). I was catching up with old friends whom we haven't met for many years and so stayed till everyone else had left, and even the wait staff had changed out of their uniforms, and yet not one person tried to hurry us or chased us out. Excellent service and food all round.
4
Most of the clients are local mainly families... An huge room, waitresses out of the time barely speaking English, but so attentive to those strangers who probably got lost as they are the only ones in place... Ready to suggest the best of the Hakka cuisine in a really "out of the time" experience: plates were all gorgeous and the bill as well was "out of the time", so incredibly cheap!!!We had dinner three times.in a week
4
I'm not sure where else I can find food like this except in Singapore or Malaysia. The hokkien noodles, the fatty pork with steamed buns, lobster cold dish, oyster omelette. They have some of these in the U.S. or Canada but never comes close to this. Have to come here hungry and skip the rice and save your tummy for the food. Typical Chinese restaurant atmosphere but can't beat the food
5
My family loves this restaurant. It serves authentic Hokkien food. In our opinion, this is the best Hokken Restaurant in Singapore. Besides, it has very good value on top of excellent food quality. What else could you ask for !!!
4
Definitely a good place to bring parents and grandparents. They will enjoy the food and ambience.
But expect typical old-school-Chinese-restaurant's (non) service. More details and photos at http://www.eatprayflying.com/restaurant-review-beng-hiang-amoy/

For good hokkien food, you will not go wrong if you patronize Beng Hiang. My friend wanted to savour hokkien fare and it was close to my office! The house specials like duck salad, ngoh hiang n prawn rolls, fish maw soup n of course, the fried hokkien noodles, were delivered very promptly. The meal also comes with a small serving of cut fruits! As usual we over ordered and over ate!
4
Our friends who live in Singapore took us to this special local Hokkien restaurant. Every dish was a true creation of local dishes being served in China for hundreds of years. The steamed fish was so delicate the only thing left were the bones. The steamed buns were filled with pork belly, like nothing I have ever tasted in the regular Chinese restaurant. This is a great family restaurant, full of local families very few americans
4
This is not gourmet dining but if you want robust Hokkien food, this is the place and the dishes to go for are fish maw soup, steamed Pomfet fish, Hokkien friend noodles, braised duck with sea cucumber and grilled suckling pig. And of course a must-have is "Chinese hamburger" - braised pork belly slices eaten with steamed bun
1
Absolutely a no go! I was there on 8 Aug 2013 night and was unpleasantly surprised when I bit on a piece of metal in the Kong Bah Pao dish. Upon checking the meat in the pao, I found another piece of metal. When the manager came over, I showed her both the metal pieces. She conveniently threw it away and say "oops I dropped it, I change for you lor" in a very unhappy tone. How can she destroy the evidence without even investigating how it got there? When the replacement came, all 11 of us couldn't carry on the meal,worried that there could be more "surprises" and we left the restaurant after paying. So this place has definitely been entered into my 'NO GO" list! from now on 
1
This restaurant has a team of old ladies (or who have worked there for many years) who wait at the table. Of course you know where this is heading... There is simply no concept of service. And they do not care. The place is always crowded and so they do not give a hoot about you. The plates are dirty and will be changed only after you tell them. No such thing as service with a smile. You will be glad if they do not snarl at you. Portions are not huge. Suckling pig is small at S$200 a pop. Peanuts are S$2 dollars a small plate. Generally, food is ok but they really need to improve on their attitude. I will not bother to go again as there are many nice restaurants nearby
4
This is an old establishment with ageing but clean decor giving it a more laid back feel for a casual meal. The food here is very decent. I particularly enjoyed the fried prawn balls ("Ngoh Hiang") while the braised pork belly with steamed buns was simply superb. The Hokkien Mee was good too but their Oyster omelette was mediocre. To finish our meal we ordered "Or-Nee" (yam dessert) and it turned out to be one of the highlights. Seriously, Beng Hiang makes very good Or Nee. It needs to be ordered early though because they take 45 mins to prepare this dessert. Service was average but nothing unexpected for a traditional Chinese restaurant like this. Overall a good pick for traditional Hokkien food
5
Literally, cos I have never been to any other... Good thing this is so excellent. Must order dishes: fish maw soup (filled with crabmeat), oyster omelette, hae-cho, kong bar pau and of course, Hokkien Mee! No corkage if you want to bring wine. I have been coming here for 20 years and where I would bring guests from overseas not exposed to this regional cuisine
4
As the title suggest, Beng Hiang Restaurant serves authentic hokkien fare with its establishment dating back to the late 1970s. It is located near the rims of the Shenton way and Marina Bay financial area, therefore it is rather popular with the office staff around the area. On top of that, it gets crowded during weekday lunch hours and fully booked during year ends and Chinese New Year celebration period. The decor of the restaurant dates back to the 1970s and 1980s which delivers a strong Chinese atmosphere of the good olden day.I would recommend ordering the fish maw thick soup with crab meat to kick off with the meal. It has become a necessity for every visit to the place since my first visit years ago. The charcoal roasted crispy suckling pig is another chinese traditional dish that has been hard to come by in Chinese restaurants today in favour of convenient and modern cooking techniques. The suckling pig takes time to prepare and thus requires customers to pre-order days prior to their meal. Other favorites to order include spiced sausage & fried prawn balls with sweet dipping sauce as well as the oyster omelette. Lastly, I strongly recommend having the traditional hokkien noodles, which is thick yellow noodles cooked in a thick savory gravy, stir-fried with prawns and squid.Indeed, the food served isn't some fancy and classy cuisine, yet, the restaurant preserves the cooking style and delivers delicious hokkien dishes of the good old days in its traditional and most authentic presentation as they were decades ago
4
One of the oldest establishment for Hokkien fare, we were not disappointed by the food. Especially delicious and must order are the fish maw soup , mee suah noodle and ngoh hiang ( meat spring roll ) will be back again .
3
My brother ordered their catering for his wedding reception.
4
What struck me are the Hokkien-style roast chicken served with dipping salt and the 'hei zou' !
5
This is the place for Hokkien food
4
Hokkien food at its best, coupled with an ambience that is almost timeless. When you walk into Beng Hiang, it's like walking through a time warp back to the 70s and 80s. Best dishes are their famous fish maw soup, oyster omelet (the portion got smaller over the years), ngoh hiang/hey cho combo, Hokkien Mee, steamed fish (Teochew style), and quite a few more. Highly recommended but don't expect anything fancy. You're there to simply eat and enjoy the food
5
Beng Hiang is an excellent Hokkien restaurant. It is failry large, and typical of family style restaurants has big round tables with lazy Susans in the middle, making it easy for all to serve themselves. We enjoyed each of our dishes, particularly the steamed pomfret. The service was quick and efficient
4
This restaurant serves authentic traditional hokkien dishes and it has been around for a long time. The restaurant is located in the middle of the business district and very convenient for diners from all parts of singapore. However, if u are driving, you may encounter parking problems with the limited parking space available outside the restaurant.The food wise, traditional hokkien cuisine which never fails to remind me of home-cooked food. Do try out their ngor hiong, fish maw soup, fried mee sua and kong ba bao (pork belly) which taste really good. The restaurant setting is what you will usually see in a traditional chinese restaurant, old-world charm. The servers are also very helpful and"traditional" with many of them having work here for many many years.Do visit this place if you are looking for a tradional hokkien meal here in singapore
5
The ambience is kitschy, the set of Big Trouble in Little China springs immediately to mind. You walk in to find round tables set for 10 spread all throughout the roomy main dining area and you remain unimpressed; but then again you didn't haggle with the cab driver, wander all over Ang Siang Hill and stride past the main entrance twice by mistake for the ambience of the place, you came for the food.The food does not disappoint. It never has and it never will. It sings, a lullaby actually, a lilting melody that evokes waning afternoon sunbeams catching dancing dust motes and the smoke from the charcoal burner your grandmother squats in front of, watchfully braising pork belly. The slow simmer of the oily dark broth accentuating the slowly melting layer of translucent fat. You KNOW what's for dinner.This is why you are at Beng Hiang.You look over at what the regulars are eating and you find 3 dishes, no more, no less. The sacrosanct braised pork belly, the oyster omelette and possibly a dish of the 5-spice meat rolls. I confess to making the trip to Beng Hiang by myself just to enjoy the pork belly without the distraction of having to make small talk or be companionable. You might consider bringing along your own favorite pinot noir as a reasonable pairing, only if the wine doesn't mind playing a very distant second fiddle; a garnish, almost.No stringing together of words will ever describe the experience adequately. You just have to let the ethereal richness of the pork fat borne by the aromatic braise flood your brain to understand that everything you've read in my review up till now is utter nonsense and has not at all prepared you for the experience

After seeing so many good reviews of this restaurant, I decided to give it a try during my mother-in-law's birthday, we have total 3 tables, ordered all the dishes recomended. The kong ba bao which is my mother-in law's fav turns out tasting blend, she is so dissapointed! The hei zou (wu xiang) is already cold when is served to us, my mum can cook this dish better! Fried mee sua still edible, at least have some taste, stir-fried watercress n roast chicken is very normal, all serve cold! The only dish that is serve warm is steam promfret which was served a gd 45 mins after we have ate the dishes i mentioned above!!! is really a waste of time!!! terrible service + terrible food!!

Have dined here several times and am still not convinced that it is the best Hokkien restaurant like what some of my friends have claimed.Their fried mee sua was excellent. Everything else seemed mediocre.For example, the duck salad dimmed by comparison with the one served at Beng Thin Hoon Kee at OCBC Centre

beng hiang ROCKS! the food there is great! it's a place where we dun have to worry about table manners and all. feel at home there unlike some restaurants where we have to sit still and speak softly. the ambience is perfect for family day. it's the place where you can hold gatherings(:All the food there is delicious espeacially, fried oyster, kong ba bao, fish maw soup, duck salad, fried hokkien noodle and sea cucumber duck and their most yummy dish- suckling pig!!!! it just melt in your mouth

Been a family favourite, since my Grandma's time. But food standards goes up and down like a roller-coaster ride. The good/bad thing is the interior deco never changed much, so notstalgic yet boring.
4
Good food at reasonable prices. Try the oyster omelette.

I have been going to this restaurant since the early 1980's. Hokkien food cooked in the home-style. Personal favourites: the pork in bun dish, their hokkien mee and their fish.

Going back to re-rate this place. Maybe they had a bad day. Heard they're actually pretty good.
