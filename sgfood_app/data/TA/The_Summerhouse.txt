A couple of friends and I visited this place around Chinese New Year. We didn't make a reservation but they were very accommodating Amd even sorted out seats for our party of four! Coffee was good. Food was delicious and the portions were just right. The prices were affordable too. The indoor seating area had awesome music playing! We had a wonderful experience and will definitely recommend this place to our family and friends.

Decided to go for this place to celebrate valentine day with my wife after seeing some positive reviews.The food quality in general is so-so but the wait between the dishes is terribly long. I have to wait for two hours for my second dish and the flow of the dishes served to customers is not in sequential.Seriously, I think the food quality and service have to be good in the food industry else you are scaring off any potential customers despite having a good ambience surroundings.When we ask the waiter and manager on the expected duration of the course meal, they told us that they will speed up the serving time and promise to complete the course within 2.5hours but seriously failed to do so despite our repeated checks.Having priced their valentine day menu, the kitchen should be well prepared for full house. To be honest, it is not even full house when we dined. If the kitchen cannot cope with the demands, they shouldn’t have suggested such menu to place themselves in bad shape and vulnerable to queries and angry customers

The place is quite remote, close to Seletar airport, and you probably need to be motivated to reach there. However, the food proposed is really excellent and we enjoyed a very nice family dinner there.However, a few things would deserve to be improved:- service was not at the level / staff very kind but obviously not experienced, so service was a bit messy, they were bringing the plates and we nearly have to take them ourselves, leaving smaller plates on the table, they did not change the cutlery between starter and main, etc...- there is actually music in the restaurant, and a different one at the cafe downstairs (quite loud), creating a real cacophony- waiting time between dishes was extremely long (they were actually teaching cooks in the kitchen while we were waiting for our dishes... :(Recommended dishes: avocado starter / slow cooked lamb as main / sea-bass / chocolate Valrhona desert (although the presentation makes it quite dubious)You may find as well some proper wine, proposed at a moderate price, which is not so frequent in Singapore :

My family had Christmas Eve dinner last night. The environment is quaint and lovely but music was quite inappropriate for a quiet dinner. Had oysters with sake jelly for appetiser and they were lovely. The cakes served for dessert were very good too. The main course was a disappointment though. The food was rationed to 2 -3 thin slices of each type of meat, even the potatoes and carrots were rationed to one serving only! It was not worth the price we paid

I have reacquainted myself with Trip Advisor simply to write a review of this exceptional restaurant. The Chef’s tasting menu was fantastic, wine reasonably priced (which is rare in Singapore), service was sensational and the new decor stylish and warm. We look forward to dining here again with friends and family.

Visited The Summerhouse to celebrate a birthday last night. Most impressed by the caring service. There was a hiccup in the reservation but the senior supervisor , Ms Sheeqah, was most accomodating and resolved the issue without much fuss. Enjoyed the very prettily decorated palatable food . The ambience was soothing and comfortable. It was a most memorable experience

Charming beautiful colonial bungalow hidden in the North of Singapore !! 1st floor is Wild Seeds Cafe & Bar with agreat live band, Poppy Florist, cosy lounge seats in a garden, 2nd floor fine dining, wine cellar, outdoor terrace seats. Amazing farm to table food, such talents in their German Chef !! This is the place that you will want to visit again and again for good food, lovely garden ambience, live band ! One negative comment will be they don't make any effort to even provide a slice of cake for birthday celebrants despite informing them in advance, it was a flat no, not even suggesting for chef to write a Happy Birthday note on the dessert plate that we have in our set menu ordered. A flaw that costs the restaurant so little and could have made Celebration there complete. Sheeqah our server is wonderful and provided great service !

Had dinner with friends. Sat outdoors as it was quite windy and not a hot day. The food was interesting but rather small portions. Had the blade steak and it was tender and delicious! Chef gave complimentary mashed potatoes which was so good!Portions are small and on the expensive side

Located right beside the Seletar Aerospace Centre, this eatery serves a good range of western favorites from pasta to steak. They a wide range of beers, wine and cocktails. The food is good quality and well presented. Service is friendly and attentive. Prices are quite reasonable for the quality we received. The grilled whole red snapper was excellent and great for sharing. There's a live band playing popular music nightly from 7:30pm or so. The casual atmosphere is appropriate for dining with friends or family
