Had late dinner with family at about 8.30pm, but Restaurant was still packed. Fortunately, we had made reservations via an app.
Food was piping hot which we like.
Service was excellent. Special thanks to Ms Sand. Outlet is at Plaza Singapura.

I visited Cocoichibanya in Bugis+. The location is quite eye catching near the entrance door. The Japanese curry lover will love this restaurant. They serve a value for money set menu. For $10.90 you can get fried rice, curry sauce, salad and ice lemon tea.

Value for money meal. Portion was very huge and good-tasting. Tried the fried tonkatsu and added hamburg patty.

Good Japanase curry house which is famous for their fried pork cutlet and Jap curry. This restaurant now has a partnership with a reservation app where you can get some discounts of food.

I've been a big fan of Coco Curry in Shanghai and the experience has been great. However, this was my first time eating at Coco Curry in Singapore at Somerset 313 and it was disappointing. When I arrived, one waitress literally just stared at me, didn't show me to my table or even smile. It was another waitress who finally asked how many people I was with by showing "peace sign" to me and an eye-contact that I assumed a question, "Two people?"It's funny that many people probably like to bash PRC for being rude, unfriendly, or unprofessional but at least in Shanghai they always greeted you, "Welcome, how many people?" with a smile

I reached the 313 Somerset branch at around 4-5pm and made it in Rome to enjoy the 30% upside promo at $12.90++ . The food was served quickly and piping hot. The serving was big. The chicken cutlet was hot and crispy. The quality and curry sauce remained consistently good no matter which branch I go - Westgate , Bugis + , Somerset 313 or even the one at Shibuya and Siam Paragon Bangkok . It tasted the same. My Son is a big fan of the curry rice at Coco Ichibanya and dining at Coco Ichibanya is always a satisfying dining experience for him. Well done , Coco Ichibanya ! Good job !

Personally, this is one of my favourite restaurants. This restaurant has quite a variety of food and you could also choose the amount of spice and rice. However, this restaurant is a little too pricey and I recommend that you should try it but not every time

My local friend and I went to lunch at the Plaza Singapura outlet yesterday.My friend had the Beef cheese omelette curry and mine was the Chicken pepper curry plus we both added Set B - miso soup, salad and a drink.We both enjoyed our meals.Afterwards my friend went to work and I flew back to Perth later in the day.The restaurant is on L3, turn left at the top of the escalators which are near the Orchard Rd entrance.It is bright and breezy with attentive staff and reasonable prices.Recommended if you like curries

Been a Favourite restaurant in Tokyo, never fail to visit while Travelling. Unfortunately the menu and taste is not the same. The restaurant here might 'adapt to local taste' portion and plating. It can be very interesting if adapt the same style as Japan. May be one of 'franchise' style Singapore bring in. None the less, we got at least 60% of the originals. Level of spicy not same.

I have eaten in this chain in Japan, Thailand and now Singapore. Curry is good. Taste is almost the same anywhere you go. Service-wise best to worst - Japan, Thailand and lastly Singapore. Service is best in Japan and Thailand. Singapore service is the usual so-so. And prices is most expensive in Singapore also. Food-wise, it is good. Good place to go for a quick meal at any-time

The food is average... Meat is a little dry and over cooked. Curry is good. Service is vey good... Maybe I am the first table ...

We like the wide selection of curries. The options for rice portion, spiciness of curry and add-ons are great. The mini sets are quite cost effective as they cost less than a drink for a mini salad and drink.

Out of the japanese curry chains in Singapore, this is my favourite. The variety of toppings and the customisability of the curry sauce are big pluses for me, and I always feel satisfied coming here.Service is generally good and prompt, but on some days it's a bit lacking - depends on who's there I think.Price is not bad - though if it gets any more expensive I'd probably stop going here and just pay a dollar or two more to eat at one of the fancier Japanese restaurants around the area

I live in the area, so I often come here for curry - usually the chicken katsu or grilled chicken curry. It's my preferred location for Japanese curry, primarily because it's tasty and good value. The posher curry at the Lai Maison Tonkatsu (at Mandarin gallery) is certainly much nicer, but I'd rather eat tonkatsu while there.Anyway, this place. There's a good variety here, since you can customise your curry with size, hotness, and various toppings. I'm a fan of adding spinach to mine (recommendation), just to take away a little of the guilt from eating so much carbs.The staff here do try to give good service, but sometimes I think there's just too few of them. There's been occassions where I've come here to a full restaurant with only two waiters - which makes it quite difficult for them to adequately service every table! I feel sorry for them, but it does get irritating at times

Visited last night with a group of 10 pax, and alerted the outlet that we would be going by. The team rose to the occasion, calling me when I was on the way, so that they could begin getting the tables ready (and this was despite the fact that they don't take reservations!)Service was prompt and we were served by Jun Jie, who took good care of us and ensured that our water glasses were always topped up. The concept of Coco Ichi is that you have the option to customise your dish. You choose a curry based dish, and have the option to customise the level of spiciness, to add or reduce the amount of rice on the plate (and you even get some money back if you choose to reduce the amount of rice!), as well as to add ingredients, such as chicken, pork, seafood, vegetables etc.Everyone enjoyed the food and had a great time. Shoutout to Jess and Jun Jie who helped to make it an enjoyable night. Thanks a lot for your help

The curry compared to the one I had tried in Bangkok is less spicy but the food is still really nice. But price differs a little. The only outlet I always go to is the one at Bugis Plus! Service can be better because the servers are not really polite but overall still ok. No regrets visiting

I ordered Chicken Cutlet Japanese Curry with Cheese and added on a set meal which came together with 2 choices of drinks, salad or dessert. The amount of rice I ordered was standard and level of spiciness was level 3 - Hot.Personally I can and love to eat spicy food, but I found level 3 spiciness challenging! The type of spicy is not the throat-burning sensation, but is the prickly-feeling of the hot pepper powder on the tongue that which was added into the curry. If you cannot take spicy food at all, my advise is to you is to choose level 0, which is not spicy at all. Level 2 would be reasonably acceptable by most people who can take spicy food

it was unlike the Indian Curry. This Jap Curry has many level of spicy to choose from and the smell is not so strong like Indian Curry. the gimmic are the choice of Rice quantity, choice of spicy level and choice of topping. It pricy compare with the same shop in Thailand but it's still at Singapore standard of cost of living. At S$ 12.-/plate was fair enough. You will never feel sorry for having this Curry dishes. Try it

Compared to the one i have had at japan, this is a entirely failure! Nothing special with the spore version, even our local-made (any mum's homecooked local curry taste 10 billion times heavenly than this)I rest my case, and this s supported by my family members who visited on a separate occasion!I m sorry for those who tasted it in Singapore and for those who have given a 4 rating and above, your hand can give better comments after you dip your tongues into a pot of tenderlicious excretory delicacie

I'm so excited knowing that Coco Ichibanya has a branch in Singapore. They have the best japanese curry ever! I always try my best not to miss it when I visit Singapore. My favorite is curry with pork katsu with cheese. For spiciness, level 2 just nice, level 3 a bit too spicy
