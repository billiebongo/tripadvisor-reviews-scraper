I have been visiting Garuda for some years now. They have opened a branch at Orchard Central located on Orchard Rd. The restaurant has an upmarket feel, a little pricy but worth the extra cost. Must have the gulai kikir, sambal tumis udang, beef rendang, the ayam goreng and don't forget to order their omelette
