Came here for beers and bar bites with a mate, the Singapore Blonde is a super refreshing beer, and the bar bites were excellent too. Friendly service as well, would recommend for a quick bite.

Went on a weekday night, not much people. Average food. Nice view if you sit outside. Food menu limited.

Food was terrible . The buffalo wings , chicken skin & luncheon meat are horrible . Food are too oily and luncheon meat taste bitter. Service was not up to standards . Over staff and they are all sitting around and not attentive .

The rooftop bar is great for views across the bay, relaxing and away from the hustle and bustle of the city

Good food (big portions) and service. Situated next to the Esplanade theatre but not very comfortable.

It was my first time trying a poke bowl, and I was not disappointed. The restaurant's location is convenient, and it was not busy on a Monday's evening for dinner. We had the Original Poke Shaker, and I was surprised at how filling it was. Both of us only managed to finish half of our bowls.The service staff was friendly and quick to attend to us. We will be keeping this place in mind for some snacks and drinks in the future

I've visited Alter Ego a number of times, and I always order Dynamite kickin which is essentially spicy tuna with a whole lot of other stuff like fish skin and kimchi. The pizza fries were highly recommended, but I think you should skip that. Not enough salami on the fries. Overwhelmed with cheese which made me feel nauseated after a while. They also have interesting craft beers! their happy hour promo is $2 off a pint of beer.

Marination of salmon was great , Flavours were there with abit of citrusy juice or dressing maybe from the pineapple . Service was abit slow maybe a lack of staff . Price for 2 salmon bowls were 40 after gst and service charge, which I felt was too pricey. Maybe to upkeep their rent . 15 dollars and I will go back .

I came here for dinner with my daughter. It was good, but perhaps trying a little too hard. The chicken wings were great and I enjoyed the Poke Bowl. Special thanks go to the staff for being so friendly and helpful.

Food was good and service was good. No complains. Had the original shake poker and chicken burger. The poke bowl was fresh and the chicken burger is very filling. Also the pizza fries is very cheesy and yummy.

Order for delivert the chicken burger and lemon pie. Chicken was amazing and buns as well. High quality and big size. The sides are very good too. Expensive lemon pie but worth it. Very tasty and just right amount of acidity!

Absolutely love the poke bowl, but the pizza fries was a tad disappointing. I would come again but just for the poke bowl.

I loved the salmon miso rice bowl and hubby ordered softshell crab burger, it came with a little cake! The place was really spacious for our pram and the whole family, including my 6mo enjoyed the openess of the restaurant. We had full view of the esplanade waters! They had elderflower sparking water and i thought the mocha was pretty decent too

This is amazing place to dine in Esplanade. The food here are excellent! The poke bowls are very nice. We had the original poke shaker. The salmon was very nice. For small bites, I would suggest the carbo load and loaded taters! the dips are amazing specially the cheese with jalapenos. They also server crafted drinks which is not usually found in any restaurants. The place is always packed so better make reservations in advance

Ok guys! The food here really gets me excited!! The flavours are amazing!! The portions are on point! And the service staff were all really friendly and interactive! It's casual dinning but not casual taste at all!! The southern fried chicken in my burger came really crispy and tasty! And the pizza fries is exactly how they described it on the menu, #cheesepullgoals! Their menu is pretty interesting cause it's divided into a clean and dirty section, well, I didn't even bother with the clean! Haha, straight went for the dirty! - 100% no regrets!! Have to go back there again to try more from the dirty side! For drinks try the blue mountain! Refreshing and sweet! Ok but objectively speaking, my gf and her Cousin in-law really enjoyed the clean side of menu, so I've to give a shoutout as well, the wild card poke bowl we delicious if your into that.I can't keep going cause I'm legit getting hungry thinking of the food! Big shoutout the the chefs for making that good food! I've included some photos for your viewing pleasure!Thanks for reading!RegardsNick

Places come and go in Singapore and I sometimes think owners seem to be disengaged or accepting of failure. So in the interests of helping this place survive... We sat outside for three hours and during that time ordered three beers. Every time, we had to interrupt our work discussions to beckon service. Not surprisingly, we had to do the same for the bill. It is not hard to see when a drink is empty. It is part of service to be proactive. They seem okay when people arrive, promptly attending to seating, menus, water. But the follow up and the chance to sell an extra round of drinks is missing. We didn't eat so I can't comment. This is a good location with good outdoor views and an air con area inside. But there are many places to have a drink in this area. Hopefully this feedback will help them lift their game.

Poke bowl, fish skin and chicken skin are delicious but the staff services is really slow and we are ordering few glasses of drinking water when we are sitting down till the end of the meal still didn't been serve and we did repeatedly ask for it but the request still not been attended!!! That the only disappointment for this restaurant.

I enjoyed my fried chicken skin a lot though my family thinks it's too spicy for them. We also had pulled pork dip, chili cheese dog and pizza fries.Only issue we had was the repeated follow-up for our drinks. We were already done eating when our drinks arrived.Overall it was a very good experience dining here
