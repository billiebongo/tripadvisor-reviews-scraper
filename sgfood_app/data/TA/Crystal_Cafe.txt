Good place for breakfast meals. Fruits are fresh and the HK porridge is delicious. Coffee is freshly brewed and the juice drinks are yummy.
Coming to eat here again next time.

The best porridge buffet in Singapore! This is a restaurant that i visit many times in a year! Decent spread, tasty dishes, free flow coffee & tea, and dessert with reasonable price! Although location slightly far (10-15 mins walk from Somerset), i will return!

First time eating there. Pretty decent spread. Especially enjoyed the braised pig trotter, braised pork, chicken and fish. Total cost for 6 adults came up to be less than $90. Place was spacious and quite cosy. Might eat there again.

That is really the only thing I want to write about. The curry made here is awesome. Absolutely balanced. Just YAMMY!!!! Being surrounded by food spots with multiple curry options and close to Orchard with all the restaurants and food courts, Crystal curry really worth trying

A cousin brought us here for lunch & truthfully I really didn’t expect to have Teochew Porridge, in a hotel cafe setting & it’s buffet style. The food is quite good, with many dishes available - Braised Pork Legs, Braised Beancurd, Eggs, Omelette, Fried Fish, Veggie & many more. You could pair rose dishes with a warm bowl of Sweet Potato Porridge, Rice or Fried Noodle. They have desserts available too! For the price of 14.80 per person, this is quite a nice, comfortable place to have a meal

Not the best rice porridge, but always a good social experience. I first ate here nearly 15 years ago. There's still plenty of good, soul food - braised pork, salted egg, anchovies, pickled cabbage, and even roti prata. But I feel its popularity has affected its quality a wee bit, hence four stars. There're much fewer pieces of sweet potato in the pot, and hardly any gingko in the barley dessert.I might bring my mum-in-law, but not someone looking to enjoy good food at reasonable price. On weekend nights, remember to call ahead

I recently went there with my sisters and mother for their buffet porridge. We were very disppointed with the lousy food that their served.The variety of food is limited. The quality of food is poor.Braised pig trotter, braised pork belly and braised bean curd are supposed to be their speciality, but they are tough and taste weird. Kuehs are tastless, fruits are not fresh and red beans soup is worse I ever eaten.Service is quite good. Crews are friendly and clearing up plates fast. For the price of $14.80++ per person is definitely not worth it at all. Will not recommend this place for those who want good and quality food

it's my socond time dining at this restaurant with same group of people and same dinner time. crews are still welcoming and helpful. But I have no idea what happen to the food. we are group of 7 ,and we all feel that most of foods were tasteless(eg. braised pig knuckles and braised chicken). can easily tell it was under fast cooking... and the most disappointing part was they already removed their most popular dessert "durian melaka" from their food selection. yes they still provide fruits and ice cream.. but well... no special.

first of all, I have to say that this restaurant will get my money again very soon,I enjoy dining there with my families for dinner today(22.4.2017),service is really good, all the server are very welcoming and friendly, ask for help to take group picture for us and the waitress offer help immediately.another waitress came and help us to take initiative when she see her colleague not familiar with my camera, thumb up!(and thanks for nice group picture) and chef are busy replenishing the food to make it more appetizing while all server are busy clearing plates for all the table and checking customers' needs (even our table quit corner,still taking care by them)and sitting is comfortable, will be more better if can make the space bigger for customer and staff easily to move :)about food, what you can named for Chinese porridge and you can find there at well-replenished food station, very nice presentation and delicious!of course, tea/coffee,seasonal-fruits and cakes as well as tau-suan are provided at buffet counter after satisfying meal. and NEVER forget to try dessert "Durian Melaka"!super tasty!!!only cost $20 per pax ,you should really give a try

We had breakfast in the Crystal Cafe as it was part of the Package while staying at Orchard Grand Court . The Breakfast was a Buffet. The food was mediocre at best . Only a small selection . Not Hot only warm . Not appetising at all . We also tried the Buffet Dinner one night , very underwhelming . Not recommended 
4
good buffett breakfast with a good range of western and asian dishes suchas eggs, fired tomato, sausages, bacon, coffe and tea, juices plus fresh fruit and pastries
1
Tried the Sunday lunch and the variety of foods is very very minimum.
Not worth to pay for $16.80++ for such foods.
3
ok for the locals and quick snack or breakfast - I choose to use local services such as "Food Panda" or great pizza from Scoozi Pizza

We've only had breakfast at the Crystal Cafe as it was included with hotel stay at the Orchard Grand Court. It was satisfactory, had enough variety of food.

$20 to eat all the hot rice porridge with Triple A pickled cabbage, braised peanuts, salty red beancurd, salted egg, chai bu-eh, braised dishes, fried fish, chicken curry (pretty good!), veggies and other yummy dishes you want.This is THE place to go for HOT comfort food in the evening at Orchard Road. Opens till 10pm.Try their Durian Melaka. Good ending to the meal. If not, have the cut fruits and cakes.I recommend making reservations though they could squeeze in walk-ins.My photos do not show all the food they had that day. The dishes do change occasionally so don't be disappointed if you don't see your favourite dish you had before

This cafe I think is quite understated. It's a Restuarant found along Killiney Road, the buffet spread is simple but very nice. The price is very reasonable considering that it's Orchard. Weekday evening crowd is still manageable, they told us no need to reserve but for weekends, yes. Will go back again if possible

Our first day in Singapore and needing a lunch time bite to eat, found us outside the "cafe" that had no diners and did not appear to be open. Upon entering and asking if they were open yet, was speedily and courteously invited into a large dining area that could seat over 100 diners. The decor was average and tables were arranged in two's, four's and a couple of larger placements.The English speaking staff made us welcome and came back in a reasonable amount of time to take our order. We had Yong Chow with fried rice and fish and chips with iced tea and a fresh apple juice, When they came, the portion was very generous, piping hot and extremely tasty. It was clear from the set up and the food that was being prepared that a buffet style menu was being prepared. The cost of living in Singapore is high so don't be surprised by the bill, however I thought it was reasonable.We were both disappointed that we were unable to return to this cafe, as it was perhaps one of the better places we dined in

Stayed at Hotel Orchard Grand Court for two weeks which houses Crystal Cafe. Visited this restaurant daily for breakfast and I hear from others that the buffet on offer during lunch and dinner is also great. Unfortunately, there are very limited options for vegetarians or vegans that forced me to look out other nearby options. No complaints on service and quality of food. Non-vegetarians would love this place

We dined at the Crystal cafe this evening and were given a warm welcome by the staff. It was quite full of what seemed to be, 'locals', (a good sign); we appeared to be the only non-Asian diners.We decided to have the set buffet menu and were invited to go up as many times as we wished. They offered a soup, with croutons and as you went round, the dishes, incorporated entrees, mains and desserts, many of which, were new to us. My favourite was the John Dory, it was delicious and cooked to perfection. I'm afraid to say, my husband and I steered clear of the braised chicken feet, I'm sure it would've been delicious, but not for us. The bill for the two of us came to approximately £27.00, that included two small beers. Coffee, or tea, came into the set price.I would have given 3.5* if I was able, as I felt overall, the service, food and value, were a little above average. If you're in the vicinity and want a relaxed, inexpensive meal, then give the Crystal cafe a try

My partner and I dined in this restaurant on 10th September.It was my 2nd visit after an enjoyable meal when I was there with friends for the first time.The spread proves that you can find cheap eats in a hotel in the heart of town. FOOD--------Dig into standard braised items such as pork trotters, pork belly, braised duck, tau pok (tofu cakes) and tau kee (beancurd skin) and many other hot meals including salted vegetables, preserved vegetables and stir fried ones and spicy dishes.They serve plain and sweet potatoe porridge. They also serve rice.Hot dessert and light snacks are also included.The dishes have a down-to-earth homemade flavour – just the way mama and grandma make it. SERVICE-----------It was not consistent. The first time we went, the servers were less polite and unfriendly. But it was a different scenario in our 2nd visit. They were attentive, friendly and warm.Overall, I would recommend this cafe for a filling dining experience at a very affordable pricing.Enjoy

Good ambience, adjacent to Orchard Road, and budget price. I admit the choices of food is on average, not too many. But given the buffet price of $16.5 per person at noon on weekdays, this restaurant is a truly good option.

Not like what was in the pictures.
Bacon and eggs OK. There was fruit and cereal.
Runs out quick and you may have to wait.
But you won't leave hungry.
3
Dated decor and limited menu. Staff appear to be experts at hiding when you need something. Food a bit of a hit or a miss probably depending on the Chef on duty. Breakfast disappointing due to the lack of choice.
3
Bland, basic breakfast buffet. Nothing fancy, warm not hot food. food runs out quickly, but I just ask for more, by approaching the man in the suit- he reeks of cigarette smoke. He will make sure the staff replenish the food. That way you get hot food. No taste here, you are only eating breakfast to put sustenance into your body to sustain you while you cope with the weather and walking. Breakfast was included in our tariff. ..otherwise I wouldn't bother..

We have been here a few times during weekday evenings, and it is usually quite quiet. The porridge buffet is quite simple fare, but the prices are not too expensive given the location.Some of the items that we like include the curry (gravy goes well with the roti prata) and the durian melaka dessert

Crystal Café is adjacent to is adjacent to Orchard Grand Court where breakfast for the hotel guests is provided. Breakfast is standar5d western buffet with a touch od Orient. The café provides food round the clock at reasonable costs and has a well laid out bar. Try the Singapore sling. Staff is friendly and polite

Got breakfast included with our hotel bookings but would have preferred not to eat there- which we didn't after 2 attempts. Food was an attempt at Western food so lots of processed, bland, tasteless food. Pastries were not fresh, hot food often luke warm and (baked beans) cold. Staff not very warm and welcoming. Preferred to eat at the local eateries where food was fresh, local and cheap and staff appreciated you coming in
3
The variety is rather limited for dishes that go with the porridge. The saving grace is the decent dessert (ie. warm barley with gingko nuts and cold almond jelly with mandarin orange juice). The latter was refreshing.Would not return again as it's not exactly value for money.

We had buffet breakfast here four days and were pleased with the good mix and variety from day to day. Plenty for us vegetarians. The only cereal is cornflakes unfortunately, but the rice porridge made up for that. Adequate selections of asian and western hot dishes, juice, pastries, toast and ample fresh fruit. Fast replenishment of dishes and friendly, helpful staff. The Cafe Manager regularly circulates for a chat. Recommended
