My 2nd time here since Dec 2015. I love the clean environment with soft music and a fishing pond outside. The menu is great for business lunch with colleagues and business partners.

Good, cheap and nice atmosphere. Great for toddlers who can check the frog pond and lotus flowers out. But careful they don't fall in! Food is nice, portions are not huge but enough. A meal of 4-5 dishes for 4 adults costs about $55.

This stall is located inside a kopitiam in an Eunos industrial, although we went on Saturday, there is many people. We have ordered the famous claypot chicken, tau suan, gai lan, cereal prawn and spinach soup. The cashier advise that the waiting time is more than 30 minutes. The varieties are a lot and the price is not expensive. They served the dishes one by one though and our claypot chicken turn out to be the last dish. My girlfriend family all feedback that it is good, will definitely be back to try out its other dishes. The best of all, they do not charge service charge and GST. The only thing is the waiting time so best is to turn up early next time to avoid the crowd. Highly recommended to try out this place

if you are looking for some where to have dinner with the family without costing you a bomb then Le Chasseur is the answer. It is housed in the industrial estate in Eunos, in a nondescriptive non-aircond building. Food is reasonably priced. my family favourite dishes like clay pot chicken; ngo hiang; black vinegar pork trotter; otak omelette; egg with bitter gourd. Dessert is tow suan but some may find this a bit sweet. Average bill for family of four less than $50 depending on how many dishes ordered

Claypot rice is a must order! Follow by Coffee pork ribs, prawn paste chickens and otah omelette and tau Suan! We order 2 large Claypot rice the first pot came 15mins after we order the second one came 30mins after order why can't they serve 2 at one time? We have 8 pax lol.. some food come in small portion and some in big . So better to ask before order.. service staff was better when I last went few months ago.. but staff is not as helpful as before lol only 1 table of us at that time no other customer in the afternoon but food serve was too Long.. love the tau Suan tho!

It was at quite a secluded place at least in the evenings when all the garages and car repair shops are closed for business. I was looking forward to the dinner with rather high expectations. But I must say it was rather disappointing. Ordered for 6 pax:Big Claypot rice, crispy pork knuckle, prawn paste chicken, Kai Lan, celery with lily bulb, steamed Garoupa fish HK style and chicken feet with mushrooms. The dishes were all very ordinary. Claypot rice was below average. The garoupa did not have enough sauce. None of the dishes impressed me although I don't think a I am a very fussy eater. Come to end we ordered the famous tau suan. It turned out to be too sweet for all. In all I would not recommend this place to anyone

I first visited this restaurant when it was located down town. And to this day, the service, quality of food have remained largely good, pleasant and consistent. Andy, the founder of the business, is an approachable person, and glad to take in feedback to improve on his food and service.One of the few places that offers barbecue live prawns, the chef, coached by Andy himself, displayed excellent culinary skills to ensure each barbecue prawn is not over done, neither under cooked. And the chef would not serve the dish if they have run out of live prawns for the day. Unlike other restaurants that will make do.The restaurant is also popular for its clay-pot, fish head peppered with chili. The fish head dish is cooked using steam and is one of the celebrated menu item to exhibit the quality of fish served in the restaurant as well as the great culinary skill of the chef.Price of menu item is surprisingly economical, folks with excellent taste buds who scouts around for great feast will find frequent visits to this restaurant a worthy affair. In fact I have seen at least one patron who have brought own red wine to feast with the dishes served

Went with family for a meal at this inert wresting restaurant. Their specialities are Claypot rice,pig trotters, grilled prawn on skewers , and Tao Suan dessert.The family owned restaurant used to be in town, moving to this eatery within an industrial estate in Eunos.They do take some time to serve. Good things come to those with wait. But it's worth the wait. Go there prepared for a slow-paced dinner. You will be there for at least 1.5 hours. But you won't regret it. The owners take pride in their food and bothers to check with the guests how the food is

Best local fare. Famous for the Claypot rice and my personal favourite crispy pork knuckles. Personally, these 2 dishes are why I visit this restaurant. Owners are very nice and warm, and the wait staff are better than your average roadside restaurant. No air-con here! But you go to get meat sweats anyway!Other things to try would be their BBQ squid and tao suan for dessert. Do note that the restaurant occupies quite a large part of a kopitiam. They provide limited drinks, you will have to go visit the drink stall at the kopitiam if you want beers or other soft drinks

This place is a gem and so is the owner/chef! He is such a nice and kind person, who is so willing to share his secrets to the amazingly yummy pork knuckles (trust me, it's better than how the Germans do it) and claypot rice (sadly we didn't get to try as our order was missed out). But instead, he cooked for us specially a hokkien noodles with oysters that is not on his menu…so super yummy that my hubby was scrapping the pot for the last drip of gravy!The other “must eat” dishes are the har cheong kai and the otah omelette. My goodness, how does one get it so good? Also, to end the meal, you must have the tau suan and the chef will teach you how to properly eat the tau suan, which will really get you to appreciate food science and flavours!We can’t wait to be in Singapore again and we will surely return to visit this wonderful restaurant, and most of all, to say hello to the chef :

Hidden gem in the ubi workshop area.
The Claypot rice is a must try. Enough said..
If you like desserts, please give the tao suan a go..
Food is consistently good. The owner can tell you why.

Great food, but food portions small. So considered slightly expensive. Claypot chicken rice, fried pork knuckle, and prawn paste chicken good. Sambal kangkong, kailan, oyster omelette average. Tau suan overly sweet.

As Le Chasseur is located at industrial area surround by all offices with business activities, it naturally ideal for bringing my business clients for lunch here. The menus has variety of dishes with star mark as special or must try. Overall nice environment too for a lunch with business clients

This restaurant is located in a nondescript industrial park.It is part of a Food Court where there are many other food& drinks stalls.Though this Food Court is nothing fancy, Le Chasseur servespretty decent dishes.Le Chasseur says they specialises in claypot rice, soups & liveprawns.The owner Mr Lim used to run a restaurant in Mauritius andthe restaurant's name, Le Chassuer (the hunter) is a legacy ofhis Mauritius stint.The three of us had the claypot rice, coffee pork ribs & grilledsquid.For drinks we had their grass jelly drink. They do not serve hotdrinks or any other kind of drinks.The quality of the food is fairly good. Service was prompt.They display on their signage the more popular dishes theyoffer.Abit surprised that they have western style pork knuckles too

Family of 7 we ordered claypot chicken, fishhead curry, otah omelette, salted duck soup, ngoh hiang, asparagus, har cheong chicken and dao suan.Hits were the claypot chicken, fishhead curry and dao suan. Dao suan abit sweet but tastes homemade.Salted duck soup way too salty.All in all a good meals, more hits than misses. Store claims no msg. No service charge, above average local zhr char in my opinion.Come for dinner, there is no ac but abundance of ceiling fans

What find. Its located near the Eunos HDB industrial park. Its really a canteen/food court during the day and at night a spacious place with very high ceiling/airy and nice food court. Parking was easy and on Saturday even though crowded, parking was easy.Their speciality is of course Claypot rice - we had a large one which is really good for 3 - 4. Nice and fragrant but not exceptional. We also had the pork ribs which is really nice and succulent. Another speciality was their pork knuckles. Much better than what you would get at the German restaurant. This was well marinated, deep fried with the skin crispy. They have one guy in the kitchen who does this full time. Not cheap at $30 but a must try. We also had Ngoh Hiang which was really nice and succulent (portions here are quite small). Service was not the fastest in the world but if you want fast service there is McDonalds. I will come back to try the other offers

We were fortunate that we did not have to experience the bad service some reviewers went through. Everything was smooth sailing as far as our experience with Les Chasseur went. According to the lady boss, Saturdays and Sundays are bad days because of the endless crowds. Weekdays tend to be manageable. That's what we did. We went on a Friday evening and surprisingly there was no need to wait for a table nor for food. The eatery is located within an industrial canteen which means there is ample seating. We ordered the famed claypot rice, pigs stomach soup, BBQ squid, BBQ live prawns, sambal brinjal, stir fried kai lan and black vingegar pigs trotters. Overall, the claypot rice is probably the best dish. While its not cooked over charcoal fire, the burnt bits at the bottom of the claypot is crisp and fragrant. Of course, its still some way to go compared with the famous claypot rice in some hawker centres. The rest of dishes are not too bad. I would say the BBQ cook has some skill. The prawns and squid remain moist and firm, unlike some places that tend to overcook and the flesh becomes rubbery.While the quality of dishes will not stir an instant craving, I do recommend the claypot rice simply for the shorter waiting time than the hawkers

Service was extremely slow. Place is a big canteen for factory workers during the day. Ordered a fried rice and many other dishes but fried rice didn't come at all. Asked 2 different waiters to check our order as we have already finished our 2nd last dish. Nobody came back to tell us anything. Finally asked another guy and he said it wasn't captured in the order. Food is so so only, nothing great. The claypot rice is a better choice but portion is small. Like the chin chow drink as its mostly jelly and they added wolf berries. Will only be back for the claypot rice and chin chow drink.

The services is very bad and slow, waited 1+ hours for dinner to start serving. Ordered many dishes dishes (Claypot Chicken Rice, otak omelette, pork knuckles, prawns, vegetables, coffee pork ribs, dessert tao suan). Kitchen closed very early and after waited for so long, they then informed us that there is no more pork ribs. Dishes started served ONE by ONE with min. 20 minutes interval In the end we need to cancelled the prawns and tao suan. We dined from 6.30pm to 8.20pm. Seriously no worth visiting this place

Hi,The food is above average but the service (especially taking orders is super slow), I think it is due to just setting up the place and therefore not up to speed.The rest of the kitchen (cooking) is quite efficient.They missed out one of my dishes and we waited like 40 minutes for nothing.I live nearby so will drop in again. But I cannot say for my relatives

Have tried their signatures dishes : Claypot rice ( average), Coffee Pork Ribs ( too salty!), tau suan ( average).
Not worth for me to make a trip there.

Do note that they have moved. Very good assam fish. Wide selection of food! More pics and details at http://www.eatprayflying.com/tzechar-review-le-chasseur-eunos/

I was told that this restaurant had been operating for many, many years. The food here is great! The fats in the pork knuckle melts in your mouth. We've tried many dishes and they're all good. The dessert is good too.

Food was authentic and excellent. Service was amazing. Server was so patient with our group of 6 helping us with recommendations. And we had a fun time also.

One of the best eatery around! I have been visiting it many times, each time the food standard remains good and satisfying. Love their zhe char dishes. Tried steam fish, crispy pork knuckle with a special fruit based dip, braised beef tendons (simply melts in the mouth). Prawn paste chicken with bones removed, how spoilt can one be! Even a simple fried vegetable is fragrant (wok-hei) and tasty. Must say claypot rice takes some patience to wait for hence its good to order once arrived. And have other dishes while waiting for the rice. I would skip the claypot rice sometimes and just have dishes and white rice, saving room for desserts. I think it is reasonably value for money considering that it is restaurant standard. They used to run a restaurant but rental drove them to take up space in a canteen. The advantage here is the space it opens up to accommodate more tables. We used to have to queue at their old restaurant

Pork leg in vinegar, Fried Pork leg, Prawn paste chicken, chicken claypot rice all amazingly good.Desserts black fungus and tau suan were also delicious.Restaurant was superbly clean and had "A" rating for cleanliness.Price also good value for money, a little less than sgd20/person for 6 persons
3
You can expect the same kind of standard as per any other reputable Chinese restaurant. Food is nice except the price. A bit on the high side.Service is too slow. They serve us pork in black vinegar first. After we finish, we have to wait for another 15 to 20 min for the claypot rice to arrive

Chef Andy used to be at North bridge but moved to this location. A few years ago. No MSG, flavorings etc and you can really taste the care that goes into the food. One of the best places I have eaten in Singapore. Not cheap by food court standards, but the food is anything but standard. I will surely go back to try some more of the dishes.

The deep fried pork knuckles is crispy on its skin and the meat is soft and tender. The special sauce that goes with it, is very special and refreshing, kind of reduced the oiliness of the dish. Another dish I super like is the claypot chicken rice. I usually do not eat rice because I am on a low-carb diet, but this claypot chicken rice is so delicious that I had a full bowl. The rice is very special, I think the chef uses basmati (Indian) rice; the grains are long and a little al-dente, not like Thai rice which is fluffy and soft. The rest of the dishes like eggs and vegetable are very ordinary, not worth trying

Six of us had great zhi char dishes; highly recommended are the claypot chicken rice (around S$20 for a large portion), prawn paste chicken ($9), BBQ prawns on skewers (@$14 for 6), ngoh hiang and ladies fingers and sambal eggplant. The crispy pork knuckle (S$32) was big, crunchy but a little bland. The bitter gourd fried with egg was good, though the stewed bitter gourd was too soft in texture, and tasted bland too. Do finish off with tausuan and youtiao (dough fritters). Reservations are definitely a must - we say people being turned away all evening
