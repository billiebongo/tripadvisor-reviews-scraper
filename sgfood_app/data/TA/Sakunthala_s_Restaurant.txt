Our group of thirteen had such a positive experience. The wait staff were friendly and efficient. They even refilled our biryani. The fish head curry was excellent, as were the chicken and cauliflower. The price is also reasonable for the quality of food.

Went for dinner. Had to wait to find some place. The menu was decent enough. Also the taste was ok and not bad at all. Next better to Anjappar in the little India area.

Enjoyed having lunch here. It is air conditioned and comfortable. Right across from Mustafa Centre which made it an ideal lunch stop. Good service. We tried their crab masala, rawa thosai and South Indian chicken meal. All that we ordered was delicious. Tasty hot drinks too. Would definitely go back if ever in the area again

I went here after seeing the reviews. This restaurant is just opposite of the Mustafa center. The cleanliness of the restaurant was worst. The table was cleaned after asking two times. At-least, I expected simple food and order chappati meal. Chappati were not properly cooked and even the vegetable curry. Also, the price is typically higher than what they offer with compared to near by restaurants.I donâ€™t think I will be visiting this place again

We took a break from shopping at Mustafa's to feed on Indian food, saw plenty of locals in here and this place did not disappoint! Portions were generous and the flavors authentic - tandoori was spot on, as was the mango lassi with it! Try Sakunthala's for a fast, delicious indian food fix while youre out and about
