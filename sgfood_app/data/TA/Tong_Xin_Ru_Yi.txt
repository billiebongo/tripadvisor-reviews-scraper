Nice food, nice service. Highly recommended the Xiao Long Xia and mutton soup hotpot. Would definitely come again.

Got to know this place through a colleague. We ordered pork soup base and mala soup base. For those who like spicy food, mala soup base is really really shiok! I would come back again
5
Soup base tasted great and without MSG. Food is fresh and portions are reasonable. Had Lamb soup base & pork soup base this time.

Food is good. I've been here multiple times. Howwever, my only issue with the restaurant is that they limited our dining time especially during peak hours. Moreover, I wish they could notify us earlier. We had to leave soon without finishing our food...

This is the undoubtedly best spicy hotpot in Singapore, wonderful taste, reasonable price, good location and environment. You can also walk along Singapore river after this and enjoy bar street at Clark Quay.

One of my most frequented place for steamboat. Very nice soup base and very fresh ingredients! Book early and you can beat the queue as well
5
I will always recommend my friends to visit this restaurant as it’s taste is great and never affected by PH or weekends due to higher demand. The restaurant is also updating itself by introducing new menus all the way.
5
It is a good place for lunch and dinner.
Nice services and environment.
I really love the spicy food here.

Had lunch at this Chinese steamboat restaurant one Sunday. There are several choices for the soup base and a wide selection of ingredients for the steamboat. As I am mainly a meat eater, I ordered a serving of the 8-seconds beef and Korobuta pork. They tasted really fresh and tender. Making your own dip from the many spices and sauces available was fun too. Aside from the steamboat, I ordered a small serving of langoustines as well. The langoustines are very large in size as compared to those at other restaurants and in spite that it was a small order, the serving is generous. The serving staff are not those who engaged in conversation but they're very helpful when we wanted to take away the unfinished servings of vegetables and langoustines. Pricewise, it's a little on the high end. $22 for each serving of about 10 to 15 slices of meat isn't exactly cheap. However, at the end of the meal, the cashier gave a 17% discount on the bill without my asking. The clientele at this restaurant are mainly Chinese or ex-Chinese nationals

Food i s good, but restaurant increased the price, i feel a bit that it is not worthy. Will reconsider if im still will go.

Almost my most frequent hotpot place at Singapore. But this time the sauce is a bit too salt and hope this can be improved.
5
Normal hotpot you need to wait for the food to be cooked, while Tong Xin Ru Yi has good food like beef, fish in the soap already. The baby lobster is also great !

Best steamboat restaurant ever and have a pleasant dinner with my friends and service were really nice
5
we went there for little lobster. but the taste is not as good as i expected...
which a little disappointed me.

It was a hassle free and fast booking that got us a table at this popular joint at a very busy time for dinner.
5
good food quality and servicers are very hospital service. the around environment is nice. The price a little bit high.
5
Come for so many times per year. The best steamboat in Singapore ever. Three type beef soup is perfect.

I went to this place twice. The first time the staff let us wait for 30 minutes and finally not telling us that they are fully booked. We needed to ask. The second time I went they rejected to split up the bill of S$ 135 by three so that we could pay separately with credit cards. This was also rejected. Pure profit oriented place, no recommendation
5
Food served with good quality and large quantity. They even sent us a bowl of noodles as birthday gift. This is already the 5th time we visited this restaurant. And definitely will visit again. Recommended to friends as well.Estimated less than SGD25 per pax to have a delicious set dinner for 3
5
The hotpot spicy soup has authentic Sichuan mala taste. Beef is especially delicious among all the food. Pls make reservation before you go because the restaurant is always crowded.
5
We went to Tong Xin Ru Yi for birthday celebration and it happened to be the promotional period so we enjoyed a 15 percent discount for our total bill. The service was nice and the food, especially the no spicy pot was superb.
5
We visited the restaurant many times. Comparing to other steamboats restaurants, the food here is fresh, and the soup tastes fantastic.
5
Nice place to have dinner with friends and I like their foods, especially "tuotuorou" my favourite and I like to go there at least once a month
5

i had been there for many many times. value of foods and very good services there highly recommended to all of you

Visited earlier this week. Have 1st floor reception and 2nd/3rd floor seats. Interior and atmosphere is decent but nothing special. Staffs cannot speak English but they have English menu. If you want authentic Chinese Huo Guo, please try.

Value for money hotpot. Good to have with fres. Lots of food to be share and service prompt . Enjoy myself

Went to this restaurant at Boat Quay with a China friend who had highly recommended this steamboat restaurant. Must order their small lobsters, really juicy and delicious with beer. We ordered a set of 2 persons meal and we can't finished all due to big portion. Love their soup based which I found that it was more deliciously than the famous HDL steamboat restaurant. Really worth for money and good service rendered

I came to ru Yi for several times and it never disappointed me. I like the spicy taste of the hot pot and the food is fresh and service is nice. Think this is one of the best hot pot I would pick up inSG and it's definitely a good choice to cater some good friends and family. Value guaranteed
