After my first experience last year, I had to come back here again when I'm in Singapore even it was for a day. I would recommend the tuna avocado & the porched salmon as well as the fried potatoes. Really enjoyed the food & experience!

Came to this place with friends by chance after noticing a vibrant vibe emanating from this place. Friendly staff, awesome food, reasonable price. What more can I say...You got yourself a returning customer here :)

We only found out it's a tapas place when we arrived, but everything here was yummy.It's more like a Jap izakaya, drinking is the main deal, food are mostly finger bites to go with the sake. Having said so, they do the food pretty well still.The Unagi Rice Croquette is a must! Reminded me of fried risotto balls, super delish. The grilled cuttlefish is also a must, chewy and flavourful, perfect to go with the sake. Not forgetting their signature grilled chicken thigh too. Skin so crisp it was crackling as you bite into the tender meat below.Service is extremely warm and friendly and I love how they are so arty farty with the hand drawn cartoons on the napkins and reservation card. You also get to choose your preferred sake glass from their inventory. Beautiful crockery, lovely food presentation and delicious food. Only negative thing is that it's really small and cramped

Found this restaurant on TripAdvisor as my husband and I were looking for a sushi place that was not $500 a person. Unfortunately, katanashi An does not have sushi so that was a little misleading. But the food we did have was delicious. Recommend getting the “KFC chicken”.Staff was super friendly and place was full of locals.

Have frequented quite a number of japanese eateries but found this exotic !You will not find sashmi or sushi rolls here but fusion like food like 5 kinds of tiny seafood sorts in served in a scallop shell or croquette in a ball (4 infact)my bill for just 2 of chef s recommendations cost $27. if you want cheap mass production conveyor belt you have come to the wrong area . This Teluk air area is where office workers come and eat !

A friend recommended this place for its lively ambience and excellent Japanese tapas. It exceeded our expectations. Do make a reservation so as not to be disappointed. With the booking, the staff prepared creative artwork on the napskins to give that extra personal touch. Staff were all friendly and order and serving processes were smooth and good. We tried many items on the menu and some came with live flaming right at the table. The restaurant did get a little warm towards the peak time on a Wednesday evening. I was surprised that some guest brought in a large baby stroller and it fit nicely through the walkway. Try the sakes with the tapas. Excellent blend.

Go there. Amazing food and service. We had the scorched salmon, sashimi salad and beef tatami - all good. Wanted to try the shrimp crochette and tuna-avocado as well but couldn’t eat more. We were seated next to the kitchen which meant good advise and comments from the chef on what to try!

I noticed that many Japanese visit the restaurant on the several occasions that I've been there and the food comes in small portions that are delicious! The tuna tatare with avocado for starters is a must, as well as the torched pork with kimchi by the side! Every time I had friends from overseas visit, I always bring them here for dinner and it's never a miss. In fact, many have visited the restaurant again with more friends on their return to Singapore! Just brought my family there to celebrate my dad's birthday and Father's Day as well! Remember to make a reservation in advance

The service is by Japanese ladies. Their service quality and their devotion are the best we have ever seen. Their foods are really delicious and it is really worth to visit. Their seating capacity is a bit limited due to the space constraints. Great place, great service and great foods!!! Cheers

Was brought here by a good friend last year & have been back a few times. Love the tuna tartare with avocado, salads & chicken. Their specials and alcohol are quite good too. Kudos to the staff who are friendly and attentive. Would definitely recommend this cosy joint for a catch-up with friends.Word of advice - do make a reservation in advance as the restaurant is quite small & usually packed.

The staff is amazing, friendly and efficient. They even remember about you and your preference every time you go. I never had this service experience in Singapore so far. When you book they prepare your table with sweet personalized details, it really makes you feel more than welcome. Food is authentic Japanese, it is excellent, tasty and well presented. The location is small, cute and in a very lively area. It is better if you book.One of my favorite place in Singapore to go solo, as a couple or with friends

My wife and I were visiting her family in Singapore over December, and were lucky enough to be taken to this wonderful little place. As soon as you enter there is an atmosphere of lightness, joy and laughter. The staff are an absolute delight and their attentiveness was neither intrusive nor neglectful. On seating you are greeting with the cheerfully hand drawn towelettes, decorated by the staff.All of this pales into insignificance when you have the food. The main chef was not there that evening, but the dishes we had were excellent.The prawn tempura was dressed with a half-boiled egg cooked perfectly giving a interesting counterpoint to the crunch of the batter. The croquettes, were hot, starchy and delicious with a satisfyingly crunchy coating. If you go here the Unagi tamago (eel omelette) is an absolute must, I can't describe how good it is.....The sake was recommended by our waitress, and was also delicious.

I visited Katanashi with my husband and cousins whilst visiting Singapore. Immediately the laidback and friendly vibe of the place came through as we were taken care of by the lovely Sachi. The unagi omelette has left a long lasting impression and the soft egg on prawn tempura is making me wish i could go back this second. The sake recommended to us by Sachi was superb and complimented the food perfectly.A fun night with all the very best ingredients that make a brilliant restaurant. When i'm next in Singapore, it will be top of my list

You will not find the likes of Katanashi An service elsewhere in Singapore. The staff are kind, friendly, warm and just full of fun. You will not be disappointed from the moment you step in. From the ambience to the food and its sake, its an unforgettable authentic Japanese experience, perfect to entertain your guests. The location is perfect too right in downtown central near Telok Ayer train station and Chinese temples dotting around the area. This place will make a memorable evening

It was my first time here and I have to say I was blown away by the service. From the moment you walk in, the staff make you feel at home. Every gesture is accompanied by a Japanese greeting, an apology for "disturbing", a thank you for coming and eating.... its amazing. And then you eat the food.... man oh man, the food was tasty, delicious, and well presented. Best Japanese food experience outside of Japan I've had. They even personalise the wet tissues they give you! The menu also amused me... this place is quirky and funny too :)The tempura is very nice and crisp, and my two favourites are the baked oysters and the tuna tartare (I'm drooling just thinking about that last one).If you're going on a budget, lunch is super cheap. It was 5 bucks for a mug of Asahi, and 12-18 bucks for a lunch main. Perfect for business lunches, too.Make a reservation for dinner though! They're usually super packed at night, especially on the Friday night

I have already been twice to Katanashi An and I think I won't stop there. If you want real Japanese food -almost like in Japan!- then Katanashi An is where you need to go. Food is tasty, fresh and always nicely presented.Not to mention the fact that the staff is always smiling, gentle and ready to discuss...Enough said - if you are in Singapore, head to Boon Tat Street and enjoy this little Japanese gem

We go Katanshi An almost every week and we love it every time! Food is excellent, fresh and always well presented at affordable prices: must try the tuna tartare with avocado, the seared salmon and the fish mini-hot pot...delicious! Drinks are also a not to miss, the mojito-sake prepared by Sachi is awesome. Cannot say enough of the staff, always friendly and keen to suggest you the best specials of the day, they make you feel like you are at home and Tim, the manager of the place, is an excellent host, he remembers your face and your orders after the first time you go there. Very hard to find a table with no booking, usually packed after 7pm
