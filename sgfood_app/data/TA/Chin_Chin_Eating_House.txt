Visited many times - Chicken rice and Pork Chop are my favorite. Paid $34 for half chicken, pork chop, dou miao, 4 plates of rice and 2 drinks.
4
Chicken for two, two plates of rice, two lemon calamansi drinks # total bill s$14.40
We love the smooth texture of the chicken. Super yummy, refreshing calamansi drink to finish up.
5
Food was quick, tasty and cheap. Can't ask for more than that. Hainese chicken was superb.
Main tip I would give is be nice to the staff and you will love the place!
4
Ate in this restaurant twice . Order different things each time. Love the vegetables and the Haines chicken.They have Malaysian food, Chinese food and some other dishes. Service not bad. Not much atmosphere but local people watching. I would eat here again if I went back to Singapore although I√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢m sure there are more fancier places.Everything we ate tasty
5
Whenever we want chicken rice, we go to Chin Chin in Bugis. The open air store may be a bit warm but the ceiling fans and super yummy food make the experience worth it! The chicken is poached or roasted to perfection. We only ordered two chicken rice orders because we also got a plate of Kuay Teow (chow fun), along with two kinds of vegetables for four of us. Love this place
4
Whilst it may not look like much, this place serves really good local food.I always end up with chicken rice, but believe me there is a lot of other local dishes to choose from. A great place to introduce friends to local food without having to travel out of town . Easy to find .

My husband and I were staying in Singapore before and after a cruise. We had passed Chin Chin and saw how busy it was, there are other restaurants in Purvis Street not doing as well. Even though it was busy, they still found us a seat. We had kam kong (a lot like morning glory), pepper steak and a dish called vegetarian which was a very generous serve of fresh vegetables - snow peas, bok choy, mushrooms, beans, carrots etc. We had water and the bill came to $32 we were so full and we still left some. We loved the food so much that after the cruise we went back because the food was so tasty. Singapore has a lot of restaurants but this one was our favourite
4
House speciality is chicken, steamed or barbeque, with rice. It's always very busy and very noisy... Eating out in Singapore is like that, people talk and laugh non stop as they eat, and they're happy to talk to strangers too. My Kung Po chicken was delicious and very good value for money. If you want to eat like the locals do, you won't go wrong here.
3
Typical Chinese Hainanese restaurant which serves both chicken rice and zi cha dishes. Lots of variety to choose from and could seme there are a lot regulars around. Chicken and rice was just average and claypot tofu taste like home cooked. With the place being air conditioned and big tables around, it is a good place for large family dinner as this is the time to order different dishes.
4
I have had the opportunity to eat here twice in the last 3 months while on business trip to SG office. The place is always crowded but if you don't mind sharing tables, it is still possible to find seats. The service is average with some staff being efficient and other simply plain rude. The price is decent and serving of food is fast. The roasted chicken rice, mixed veggie and chicken liver are all tasty and still worth the visit
5
My Singaporean colleague took me to the restaurant. It is located along a street with a lot of restaurants serving Hainan cuisine. Chicken was so tender. Getting toward noon it got so crowded with locals. Must try.
4
Nice local food that was well prepared. The staff was nice and helpful. We enjoyed being there experiencing local food
4
Great food, quickly served. English is spoken by the staff, but pronunciation ....a lot of fun.
Cash terms only.
Reasonable prices.
4
Well known for their Hainanese chicken. Other dish-worthy items are its pork chop, chap cai and hei zou.
Place is big but when it gets packed, it can be noisy with all the echo.
Don't expect first class service, but it's food is üëçüèΩ
4
Ordered the white hainanese chicken rice, and it's tender and juicy! The mixed vegetables is good with nice sauce too. The ngioh hieng is crispy and good too. Pork chop is a little too dry and hard.
5
The pork chop here is one of my favourites .It tastes so delicious you must try it and the prices of the foods here are all very reasonable too.
4
Was caught in the pre-race mayhem and decided to ride a bike through Seah Street and Purvis Street. So I stopped over unexpectedly at Chin Chin's during the F1 weekend as the rest of the local eateries were closing up at 8pm. Had a quick dinner between errands and was pleasantly surprised. Quick service and good food. Had traditional "white" Chicken rice, with all the chili and ginger condiments and a Chap Chai mixed vegetables with Tang Hoon. All for below $15 bucks SGD and a nice lime juice.
4
Well, if you are looking for a fancy restaurant who serve the local food than this place may disappoint you. Very basic local restaurant with only cash, no card. Food was ok. We ordered Fried Rice and Thai Chilli Chicken. Both were ok. Total bill was less than S$20. So cheap food. Would I go again? I doubt......
5
My favourite restaurant in Singapore is the Chin Chin Eating House or Chin Chin Restaurant. Take a train to Bugis MRT or City Hall MRT and walk to this restaurant at Purvis St. This restaurant has been in operation for the last 30 years. It serves authentic Hainanese food and the popular dishes are pork chop, beef stew, bittergourd with beef and the fragrant Hainanese chicken rice. The chilly and black sauce are excellent . The price is reasonable. If you come here on Saturdays and Sundays then you must be prepared to wait for a table as the restaurant is usually very crowded. Service is fast and good and most patrons are regular diners who come from near and afar
5
I've been here numerous times and they serve a wide range of food selection, with a recommended section of their Hainanese specials. Their Steam Chicken is juicy and yummy with the right dose of sauce laden when served. The Hainanese Pork Chop is crispy (you have an option to have the tomato sauce served separately if you don't like mushy pork chop). The Hainanese Mix Vegetables is interesting as they fried it with small shrimps, lending the dish an umami taste. The Hainanese Claypot Mutton is delicious, served with a unique concoction chilli sauce. It isn't expensive to have a whole family of 6 - 10 people dining here. It costs approx S$7 - S$10/pax with either chicken rice (rice cooked in chicken broth & pandan leaf) or plain rice. The restaurant is air conditioned with a couple of outdoor tables (if you prefer to dine along the five foot walkway). There are different sized dishes for different dining sizes, so do check with the staff if you want to downsize or upsize whatever you fancy. There are English & Mandarin speaking staff so communication won't be a problem. They may look grouchy but are actually very friendly
4
Great food. I was a little cautious of the school canteen type atmosphere. Good chicken and rice, good beef. No concerns at all.
English can be a bit hit or miss with the staff and the diners we spoke to were all local.
2
Wasn't sure this was even chinese food. It was bland, not that it needed to be spicy. Prawns in cereal, -tastless. Crab with salted egg, overcooked. Need I say more.
1
Very disappointing! After the rave reviews we had the chicken rice and the pork chops. Bland parboiled chicken, plain lukewarm rice and dry overcooked tasteless pork (which had been hanging around somewhere)
3
This is a cultural dining experience with lots of choices on the menu. A bit confusing for a tourist but a satisfying excursion into eating like a local.Food was bland and is prepared for the masses. If you want flavor and texture this is not for you. Seating was crowded and shared tables the rule at meal times. Hot and not air conditioned.Still, wanting to follow Anthony Bordain's experience, it was a nice thing to try. I won't be back though because there are many better places to eat
4
Check out this place for authentic Singapore Chicken Rice which was really tasty. I have had better Hainanese Pork Chop though. Still it was delicious and worth the visit. Lunch time is rather crowded. Be prepared to share tables. Was glad the restaurant staff spoke English and are quite helpful. Definitely recommended
4
We ordered a half white chicken and half roasted chicken for four people, 4 plates of rice and soup as well as a small serving of vegetables for sharing. We also had four drinks. The total cost of that meal was about $31-$32. The waitress was attentive and our food was served quickly. WE went during a quiet time at about 3pm, after the lunch crowd had gone. The food was delicious as always and I like that the chilli is spicy and tangy. We also have the option of grated ginger, which not many chicken rice places offer. Great place for family meals at reasonable prices. The eating house is not air conditioned but there are high ceilings and fans. It could get a bit warm during peak hours. Overall, very pleased with the food, service and environment
4
If you would like to try good authentic Hainanese cuisine and some other local dishes at reasonable prices, this is the place to go. Chin Chin Eating House has been in business for decades and is very popular with locals. Service is efficient. The eating house is particularly busy on weekends during dinner. They do accept reservations for large groups. This is a good place to bring friends from overseas who wish to try Hainanese chicken rice and other local dishes
4
We eat at Chin Chin 3 night while stay in Singapore and we found the menu great, the Ginger beef was by far my favourite, but other meals also held their own.It is an eating house so quite casual, but you can get a really good meal at a reasonable price.There are lots of eating house/ restaurants in this area so very competitive.It is well worth visiting this area and trying Chin Chin.They cater for small and large groups
5
The place was crowded with the older younger generation which indicates good food. We ordered both the white and roasted chicken and the hainanese pork chop. The chicken rice was lovely and my kids had second helpings. The chilli was potent but just the way I like it. Will be back
3
Serve Authentic Hainanese Chicken Rice and Western Pork Chop.I simply like Singapore Hainanese Chicken Rice.Chin Chin just so-so among the rest i had before, about taste and value.Single Serve portion Chicken Rice cost $ 5.00, whereby you may get it somewhere else cheaper ($ 3.00 ~ $ 3.50), and taste much more better.Just that, the restaurant located at the street that, Hainanese gather the most during the British Colonel era
3
The place is obviously extremely popular as we were only just about able to get a table! We ordered Hainanese (sorry about spelling!) pork for 6$ and cashew chicken for 14$. The portion sizes are very big and the food is tasty... but not amazing.
4
Non air conditioned but equivalent to the old swee kee restaurant in middle road.
There are many other chices b sides chicken rice that you try like hainanese pork chop, mix d vegetable sour, ngoi hiamg, pepper beef, tofu
5
Great offerings of a Chinese restaurant. The chicken rice is one of my personal favourite, great fragrant rice with an unbeatable chicken rice chilli.
4
Chin chin restaurant in Singapore is awesome, had some amazing chicken rice. A half chicken half a chicken and rice with chilly and a broth that I drank. Learn how to eat with a spoon. Another awesome meal in Singapore
4
It's too bright and a bit shabby but it is where the locals consistently take me for delicious chicken rise. You don't go for the decor or the service but rather to eat the local specialty and experience a bit of old Singapore.
4
Happen to walk by going towards Raffles and saw this place. Crowded for a mod afternoon so decided to try. A lot locals in the place so had to be good. Promptly seated with menu and order a Tiger beer. Big bottle beer was out with in second with chilled glass. A lot of food choices noodles, rice. Duck chicken, spicy not spicy on and on....yumHad the thai chicken and fried rice. Very good and spicy. Cant complain.One note. Its cash only. Moderately priced and off Beach Blvd on the corner. Enjoy this find
3
Brought my wife here to try the famous Chin Chin Hainanese Pork Chop. The Pork Chop was served separately from the sauce thus keeping the crispiness but the sauce was a bit thin. The service also has much room for improvement. And the price is not cheap.
4
I love a local eating experince. Chin Chin is certainly that. In a street lined with many 'local' eating establishemnts alongside more fine-dining ones, Chin Chin takes the cake. Food is fresh and prepared before your eyes. Huge number of tables and yet staff manage super service even at the height of a busy lunch period! Runs so efficiently. Staff always found time to talk with me as well. Tried variety of food, many of the noodles as well. Each dish was really good, hence going there four times - and handy that my hotel was only three doors down
4
I have tried several local eateries in Purvis St and Seah St, all popular with locals and serving fresh and tasty, simple and cheap food. Chicken rice is my favourite Chinese dish, and I enjoyed it at Chin Chin. Newcomers to Singapore should not be put off by the no-frills look of places like Chin Chin - hygiene requirements are strict and the food always fresh. What you save by having a delicious $4 lunch you can then spend on an expensive drink at nearby Raffles
4
Recommended by a local, found the place by the number of people wanting to get in. Food very good and not expensive. Service not as good and beer could have been colder. But we did go there for the food and certainly very happy with that
4
A vintage coffee shop atmosphere, filled with patrons enjoying good chicken rice and other Hainanese dishes. One of us had a extra bowl of rice and another packed more back.
4
Simply the best chicken rice I've had, price is very reasonable & the portion is generous. Avoid going there during lunch time as the places is filled with office workers nearby
5
Hainenese chicken rice - silky smooth - best in the area - stir fry broccoli with garlic to die for! Sitting at the sidewalk tables makes for a truly timeless and exciting food experience.
5
No expensive, i've ate seafood rice fried and roasted chicken so delicious. The choices of menu so many
4
A local friend told us that this is the best chicken rice and indeed it was. The restaurant has no ac but fan.Order the Hainan chicken rice, not the roasted chicken with the brown skin.Most prefer the thigh and leg part which for me is a bit raw. I prefer the breast meat, comes with soup.The chicken was tender and moist, cooked to perfection together with the condiments chili sauce, and mince ginger. The kangkung with chili was very good and the best to get is the key lime juice which actually cleansed the ginger and refresh your mouth. Ask waitress to see how much you need to order just as we were advised and just enough for us.Was so delicious that we went back the last day before we left back to EuropeThe char kway teoh noodles was ok
5
A Singapore friend suggested that we eat here. There is no air conditioning (a few ceiling fans around the large seating area) and they do not accept credit cards. It appeared that we were the only Americans in the restaurant at the time. The chicken and rice was outstanding! We ordered a whole chicken, half boiled and half roasted. Both types of chicken were moist and tasty. The rice was also delicious. We also shared a pork chop which was outstanding. The restaurant is a short walk from many hotels in the area. The prices were very reasonable
5
The concierge at our hotel recommended that we visit a specific street close to our hotel and we ended up choosing Chin Chin. The place was very busy but we were seated at a table for two and the man who looked after us provided us with bi lingual menus.Our chap (who was, thankfully most proficient in English) looked after us incredibly well, even advising us not to choose certain dishes as they probably wouldn't be to European tastes. Our meal arrived and it was excellent! We chose a mixed vegetable curry pot, ribs, a beef dish and fried rice. We also ordered a coupe of Tiger beers.We enjoyed the experience so much that we returned the next evening and have talked about it since!Will most certainly be on our list for when we return to Singapor
5
Not a lover of chinese food but our tour guide Victor recommended this restaurant for its quality and price.we were not disappointed the food was excellent and of very high quality .This restaurant was a very pleasant surprise we were six in number and all of us really enjoyed it.When i revisit Singapore i will definately go back here
4
The canteen style eatery is located on the famous Purvis Street right behind Raffles Hotel with many high end restaurants. It is most famous for its chicken dish. So two of us ordered half a chicken and a veggie for lunch. The meat is tender and fresh, much tastier than that of Tian Tian, the more famous Hainanese chicken rice stall, and the quantity is plenty. Be there before noon to avoid the crowd
4
We shared a small spicy Thai chicken eight dollars, and a thin seafood noodle five dollars.It was enough for us. With two lime juices, it came to 20 dollars. The menu price includes tax.Tasted good. The place was pretty full, seemed to be a lot of locals. We spoke to a couple who lived round the corner and go there often
4
We've eaten at Chin Chin the last several times we've been in Singapore. The staff have been accommodating and friendly. The food is delicious. We like the Hainanese pork, rice for chicken rice, and various vegetable dishes. And of course lime juice to drink.
5
As usual the chicken is as good as the olden days... maintaining standard and consistency. Pack with lunch crowd and worth the wait in a long Q
5
It's close the hotel where I stayed. In addition to great chicken rice, they have many mouth watering dishes. Your choice of beef, pork, chicken, fish, vegetables. You just name it.
3
I have tried the chicken rice and claypot toufu. They taste average and quite common. Half the chicken + rice + claypot toufu with drinks costs about $28.
4
This restaurant is located near to national library, which is a walking distance fr bugis mrt station. This is an old eatery that served both chicken rice and zhi cha. The serving is fast and efficient, since we only have 3 person, we have ordered small for all dishes and the portion is good. As for the price for city area, the price is quite valuable and average. There is a lot of people during dinner time, highly recommended to go
4
Was taken here by our friend who grew up in Singapore. Arrived during lunch time which was quite busy but still able to get a table.Ordered half a chicken mixed (half steamed half crispy skin) fried prawn rolls, hainanese pork schnitzel, Kan Kong Belecan and three rice. Food came out quickly and was very good. Can definitely see why the locals come here. Bill came approx $50SGD which included couple of coconut juices and longan drink. The place is clean and service is prompt. Will definitely come back to this gem next time we are in Singapore. As a side note remember to bring your own wet wipes/ tissues to the restaurant. (It's a common practice in a lot of Asian countries)
4
Enjoy coming here. Traditional feel. A little lost in time. Brings me back 20 years maybe...I like the fried hainanese pork chop. The salted egg prawn was so so. Black pepper beef was nice. Seafood soup ok. The chicken rice fragrant. On the whole, it was good. And very reasonably priced. 3 dishes, 1 soup and 3 chicken rice, for 3 persons, was only $40. That's a good plus point. Dinners for the family in town areas easily cost $20+ per person. You can get a hearty meal here for much less. The aunties who do the service here are down to earth and friendly. A change from inattentive youthful staff in the cafe or restaurant scene. I'll be back some day soon! Enjoyed the food!
5
My friends took me here as this was a famous place for the Chicken. Indeed! The chicken rice is yummy... We ordered half boiled/half grilled.We also ordered the prawn in battered salted egg --- it was a one of a kind taste. Not boring because it was spicy. Prices are affordable. Location is easy to find
4
If you want a nice romantic evening meal forget this place, but if you want an authentic Chinese meal this is the place for you. When we went there one Subday evening about 7pm the place was buzzing. The place was full and we were the only Europeans their as it seemed to be full of locals. My experience is if the locals eat there the food must be good and it was. The price was also reasonable and overall a fun experience
5
My Singaporean friend said you can't come to Singapore and not have chicken rice. And she said this was one of the best venues in the city.....she wasn't wrong. Delicious, delicious, delicious. Located only a 5min walk from Bugis station, cheap and so flavoursome. A must to visit when in Singapore
4
authentic Hainanese food, esp. the chicken & pork chop! the environment too, of a "feel-good local" factor... don't go too late as the chicken sells out fast! don't be deceived by the chickens on display, as they can already be "choped" (aka booked in advance)!
4
Have to visit if you're in the area... Try the steamed chick and pork chop... It's to die for... Great for families
5
Great local asian food - always busy with locals. Try the steam chicken and roast meats. Cheap food the old way. Taste of Singapore.
5
We ate here tonight as we were staying locally at the Adonis Hotel. The service was excellent and the food to match! Tasty dishes and flavoursome, we enjoyed fried rice, noodles, sweet and sour pork and half a chicken. Too much for us and we couldn't finish it, washed down with a bottle of beer, all for 42 dollars, so great value. Really lovely evening
5
We found this place on trip advisor and gave it ago on our way to Raffles hotel. The place was packed with locals and the menus are in English as well. We ordered 4 dishes all small and the food was really tasty. The dishes filled us up. Highly recommend the chicken with cashews, beef fried rice and sweet and sour prawns. 4 dishes and 2 cokes for under $40 to!!
4
If you're looking for affordable dining while sampling Singapore's iconic dishes, head down to Purvis Street.This place is packed in the evenings so come early to get a comfortable table. Be sure to know what you want to order when you call the servers. They move quickly here as it's really busy during dinner time. Some of the servers are elderly so be patient if they can't here everything you say! They're very nice though.We ordered the famous Chicken Rice which was tasty. The Hainanese Pork was not bad either. Servings are big so you will leave really satisfied.Prepare cash as they don't accept credit cards
4
My go-to chicken rice places in SG are: Tung Fong Fatt at Market Street, Tian Tian at Maxwell Food Centre and Chin Chin at Purvis Street.But over the years, I find Tung Fong Fatt's chicken rice too oily plus the queue is bad during lunch. So my recent favourite is Chin Chin. The rice is fragrant and I love it's texture - perfectly cooked rice that's well balanced - not too oily and its boneless chicken is really tender. Be sure to go with all 3 sauces for better taste - the chili, ginger and dark sauce
4
Singaporean food has always been our favourite. Problem is there are too much choice in this city. We were in a taxi to the Hawkers Stall when the driver heard us talking about the food and recommended this Hainan restaurant, just two corners down from Raffles.It sure was a pleasure. The restaurant was spacious, tidy and almost full. The service was excellent, waitresses smiled and guided us with their recommendations. Food was excellent.We had a great lunch here
4
Got there around 6pm on a monday evening, half full. This is one of the better and cheap local chicken rice place. Also recommend their fried porkchops, very tender and taste best with the tomato sauce they give.Don't pee in their restroom, is a joke
4
This particular Hainanese eating spot was featured on Anthony Bourdain's former show, The Layover, so I just had to try it. Turns out his recommendation was solid (of course!) As other reviewers have pointed out, you can't visit Singapore and NOT have Hainanese chicken rice; it is practically the national dish of Singapore if you believe all the guide books. The food experience in one word: excellent. My wife and I ordered the the chicken rice but a mixed plate with half steamed chicken and half roasted chicken. We also ordered the Hainanese pork chop which was also very, very good.Two last items: first, be prepared to share your table with strangers. The two men my wife and I shared a table with were very friendly locals and asked us about our experience in Singapore. Chin Chin eating house is incredibly busy, so sharing a table is to be expected. And don't worry, they are rather large tables so you don't feel too cramped; at least we did not. Second, unlike other reviewers who mentioned the lack of service, this was not our experience. Yes, the wait staff is busy and can't spend much time with you, but they were generally very friendly. Our particular server asked if it was our first time there and then took the time to explain how much we should order to ensure we did not order too much or too little. Once our meal arrived, she also showed us how to use the various sauces. Overall, it was definitely worth the experience. Do it
4
Good service from the helpful staff. Could easily adjust our orders to accommodate our requests. Great tasting, well worth a visit
5
Comfort food for Singaporeans. Hainanese food at its best - chicken rice, port chop, chap chye (mixed vegetables), mutton soup, ....Come early before 12 noon or prepared to fight for seats as the lunch crowd arrives. Staff there are always busy and might come across as rude. They are nice people, just really busy. And remember, you are here for the food, not for the ambience, not to chit chat with friendly waitresses
5
Cannot go to Singapore and NOT have chicken rice. This place is a gem. On a small side street near Raffles you will find Chin Chin Eating House. It is not fancy - it is not supposed to be as it is an eating house! Plastic plates and cups etc. Extensive menu but we had the chicken rice and a fried rice. Both were amazing. Chicken perfectly cooked, rice wonderful. Vegetable fried rice also very well done. Beer cold. What else could you want? This is a local place and priced accordingly - extremely reasonable.GO HERE. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!
4
Many claim the best Chicken Rice is served at Mandarin Singapore. I disagree. Chicken Rice should be enjoyed in a traditional Singapore coffee shop, with the crowd and heat. Dip the juicy white succulent chicken slide (ask for the chick thigh meat) in a mix of chilies, ginger and dark soya sauce. The mutton soup is delicious (only available Fri and weekend). The mixed vegetable is also a must try although it can be rather oily. Their curry fish head is also good. Don't expect fine dining services
5
In a city now dominated by trendy Westernised fast food (mostly overpriced!) it was awesome to re-experience the Singapore of old. Located in Purvis Street with plenty of other old Victoriana architecture, this restaurant specialises in Hainian cuisine such as steamed chicken. Service is efficient and friendly(we had lengthy conversations with one family proprietor), dishes were served promptly, food was delicious and the price was inexpensive. The exuberant atmosphere of Chin-Chin says it all. Do yourself a favour and go back in Singaporean time!
4
Location - Between Bugis and city hall stationFood- Had the chicken rice for 2 and their hainanese pork chop. Chicken rice was decent and the pork chop quite good.Service- fair service. Hard to find seats during peak hours.Value- About $20 including gst but no service charg
3
Came back here this week for another round of chicken rice. The place was totally packed at around 12:30 on a Monday lunchtime and we were quite fortunate to get seats. Service took a while given the crowds. Quality was fine and prices were reasonable. Will probably come back again, although will try and arrive earlier to avoid the delays in service
1
Food was solid - but Service was Horrific....I'm not prone to give horrible reviews - I can't remember when I last gave anyone a failing grade - but the waitress's attitude warrants it in spite of the terrific chicken rice. I wouldn't go back ever again and furthermore would recommend no one ever go there unless compelled by necessity or circumstance. I brought my newlywed wife from Taiwan twice to the restaurant for the renowned local Hainan chicken rice delicacy. No service first time - we were turned away despite request for take-away 10 minutes before closure. The second visit was far worse. Several inquiries for met with stone face (my wife later confirmed to me it was the same waitress's as the night before) and rude service from the waitress. Every well-formed, polite question was met with 2 word answers - no more than three - at wit's end I despised having to raise my tone to get answers to what we ordered off the menu. I escalated the issue to the manager and forthrightly told her in my 39 years of travel I've never felt so poorly services or treated.If you're a first timer, be prepared for having to self service at a sit down eatery...
2
Had dinner here in Jin Jin (Ê¥•Ê¥•) restaurant in Purvis Street with my family. Although still rather crowded, the food lacks the 'wok-hei' or the 'taste of fire' in the dishes. The chicken was as tasteless as the complementary chicken soup. The place is air-conditioned but the floor is oily. They only limited drinks available at 8.30pm was Hot Coffee and 2 variety of Can Drinks and Ice lemon tea. The experience we had with the food and service has dropped a notch from our past visits. Price remains the only attractive reason to try this restaurant
4
We have been here simply because we are following Anthony Bourdain's Singapore Layover journey. And it did not disappoint us. The place is simple, looks like your normal eatery. No aircon. Or maybe there is, we just didn't feel it. Bit hard to find - we came from Bugis and we just walked going here. But the food is amazing. We have enjoyed our Chicken Rice and Fish Head Stew. Very tasty. My husband specifically liked the fish eye. Authentic Asian food
5
Fat first sight of the eatery, I felt I made the right choice of following Anthony Bourdain's trail in SG. "Chicken Rice" is simple and awesome, "Fish Head Stew" is the exclamation point!
4
Hainanese Chicken is delicious, the rice is flavourful and they have plenty of wok-fried dishes to go together with their chicken rice. Prices are affordable and it's located in the city. The shop has a authentic and traditional feel to it.
5
Situated behind the Naumi Hotel on Purvis Street, Chin Chin is one of the small informal restaurants on the street with reasonably priced, informally served local dishes. This is a relaxing option to getting dressed up for fancy dining and the food is excellent.
3
I've been here several times over the past decade yet I've never had the Hainanese pork chop. Big mistake! It was so tasty we ordered a second serving! Besides the pork chop, we also had the chicken rice, eggplant with salted fish, kailan and hei zhor (minced meat roll). They were good but not outstanding to specially return. The bill came to about $50 for 4 persons
4
This place is our go-to place whenever we are in Singapore's central business district as it is more comfortable compared to a hawker centre. The chicken rice here while is not the best in Singapore, it is good. We also like to order the seafood ee-fu noodle, bean sprouts with salted fish, sweet and sour pork. Note that at times, the consistency of the food may not be the same but overall, this place certainly serves comforting Singapore Chinese food.
4
I went to Chin Chin recently and had a wonderful meal. We ordered Hainanese chicken rice and Hainanese pork chop, the latter which is a specialty. Both were wonderful. The pork chop was boneless, pounded very thin, breaded, and quick fried. The restaurant is a very simple eating house with mostly round tables for large groups. My friends told me this is a local favorite, and I can see why
4
Great and incredibly cheap food! Just tell one of the staff how many people in your party, and then they sit you down and you order. The food comes out very quickly. I usually order the cooked dishes with chicken rice - but not the chicken itself. As noted by some other reviewers you can get better chicken elsewhere! Our favourites here are the pork chop, tofu, sambal kangkong and sweet sour pork.
4
As other reviewers have mentioned this is a restaurant used by the locals. It is basic and no frills but clean and the food, the important bit, is excellent. The plates, chopsticks and tables are all plastic so if you are looking for fine dinning the this is not for you. However, the menu is a reasonable size, the service is quick and efficient and the portions are good. The black pepper beef and sweet & sour pork were particularly good as well as the Singapore noodles. The prices are very reasonable and the beer was refreshingly cold!
4
Worth a visit. Ate here randomly since it is close to my hotel and it was packed with locals. Got the Thai chili chicken and enjoyed it. There was a mixup in that I wanted chicken rice not steamed rice, but that's not a big deal. I will likely try this place again. It was quite good.
4
We stopped at Chin Chin for a quick lunch after seeing how full it was with locals having their lunch. We ordered 2 noodle dishes and they didn't disappoint, the seafood in the dish was excellent and the service was quick. If your looking for a quick, cheap & decent meal this is definitely the place for you.

Very good food and very helpful courteous staff. Extremely good value, busy with lots of local people eating there every day.

Their white-skinned chicken has a smooth and bouncy texture. The chap chye dish is also a pleasant companion which blends well with the rice.
4
Made the effort to come here for an early lunch (so as to avoid the inevitable crowds). It was worth it: good quality traditional chicken rice. We had some side dishes with vegetables which were also pretty decent. The place was totally packed by 12:15 so it's certainly worth getting here early

I have searched up and down, went through the top 10 list of the Best Hainanese Chicken Rice to try in Singapore, decided to give Chin Chin a try at the end. Honestly compared to few other similar restaurants along those small streets in Bugis near the Raffles Hotel, Chin Chin was far above my expectation. The portion, thickness and tenderness of the chicken plus the rice was just right. What else could you ask for when you are able to have some delicious local dishes in the comfort of the air conditioner with a good service from the staffs? The best part was, it's so close to the mrt train station. Parking can be found at the side streets too
4
This is a very expensive part of town to be staying with Raffles Hotel and the Fairmont close by. Even very casual places like Thai Express ended up costing way more than expected, so we were very pleased to find this place down a quiet street providing great tasting local dishes at a fraction of the price of most of the other nearby places.Hainan chicken was great value for money compared to the one we tried at Mandarin Orchard - not as good for sure, but far better value for money
5
The concierge at our hotel told us about Chin Chin because we wanted to eat local food. We had an excellent lunch and our server took excellent care of us. The chicken & rice was the best we had in Singapore. Th cost was a bargain
4
The food here reminds me of home cooked food. Must try dishes include Hananise Pork Chop, Chicken, Kang Kong, Mixed Vegetables, Hotplate Tofu, Fu Yong Omelette and many more! Moreover the price is economic! Definitely a good place to catch up with friends and family over lunch or dinner
5
Had a meal with 5 adults in our group. We ordered 2 sets of fried rice (sambal and seafood), hor fun, roast port, veggies, beef with kailan. We tried to order more but the waitress informed us what we asked for was good enough for our group. True enough, we finished everything! and we were very satisfied. We went on a Saturday, around 6pm which was great as the place was filled around 7pm
5
Recommended to us by our taxi driver from airport. Beware - they close at 9 pm! It was closed by the time we got there that night.As it's only a one night stopover for us, we went back for a early lunch the next day at 11.30 am, soon after they opened. It got filled up pretty quick just after 11.45 am!Best Hainanese chicken I've had for awhile. My husband had mutton clay pot. He thought it was good and very tasty. Not to be missed
5
They are known for their chicken rice, however, in my opinion, their chicken rice is just average. The must order item from their menu would be the Hainanese Pork chop.They used to have the 'dry' version of the pork chop with fried onions on top on the menu a few years back but have since stopped. Only old regulars would know of this 'secret' dish that you can still order but is not on the menu.Service is average. Overall one of the best zichar places in Singapore
3
Average chicken rice. The rice is not as tasty as I could have imagine. Chicken is ok. I have eaten better ones. I saw opposite the store there is a potential better chicken rice.
5
Just pop in for a dinner for two, half steam chicken, one dou miu (veg), one kai lan (veg), one lemon tea and one lime juice, cost nothing compare to London. Nothing to complain about, just perfect.
4
We had read some complaints about staff not speaking English but that was not a problem. Very tasty and tender steamed chicken, good kailan, and nice pork. Meal for 2 for less than 30$. Well worth it.
4
Everyday restaurant and must for haianese chicken steamed or roasted. Prices are on the lower end and the food is great. Nice place for lunch.
4
Chin Chin is a quick and easy way to get your fix of chicken rice. Popular with locals, ex-pats and tourists alike. A wide range of other local dishes are available but why not try the chicken rice?
4
This is a place where locals, foreigners and tourists come for good and inexpensive Chinese (Hainanese) chicken rice.On this occasion, we didn't order the famous chicken.We ordered:1) Hainanese pork chop2) hot plate beancurd with seafood.We ate these with chicken rice. You can have steamed rice instead of chicken rice. The portions were huge for a small portion. Loved the pork chop (similar to Japanese tonkatsu) but hot plate beancurd was average. The chicken rice was very fragrant. Only paid $20sgd for 2 person.If you're a first timer, just order the dishes on signboard outside the eating house.

We saw Chin Chin on an episode of Anthony Bourdain and knew we had to try it as it was so close to our hotel. We arrived at a very busy time but managed to grab an outside table that was being vacated. We were not sure about our choice when we're were not acknowledged when we spoke to an older gentleman clearing the table. We decided he did not understand our English as he returned later smiling as he wiped down the table. A kind patron assisted us with asking for help ordering. A waitress arrived and chatted with us before sitting down with us to help us chose our dinner as well as take a short break and rest her sore knees. We felt like regulars when we placed our order for Chicken rice, Hainanese Pork Chop, Cereal Prawns and Coconut Juice. Our order was delivered with condiments that varied from mild ginger to very spicy chili sauce. The juice was refreshing and the food was tasty. The waitress seemed to like us as she gave us small packages of tissues which we understood we would have to bring ourselves. The waitress continued to stop and chat with us until we finished our meal we gave her a small tip which seemed to please her and left both full and satisfied with Chin Chin and our choice of food.The outside tables were covered by and felt cooler than the open air interior of the restaurant. It appears to be a regular choice for locals as well as tourists so go early or late if you can. The meal Cost about $32.00. USD. The price might be higher than at Hawker Centers but the convenience to our hotel made it worth it to us. We cannot compare our meal to the thousands of restaurants in Sinapore but we enjoyed our Singaporean meal and give it a thumbs up for those willing to try a local small business

For some reason they don't call it hainan chicken Rice in Singapore they just call it chicken Rice but the taste is near enough the same. This place is an old haunt for many a regular in Singapore and I can see why. For less than 5 sing you can have a plate of chicken rice which is essentially some chicken (I suggest not the roast chicken since steamed is more authentic) and some rice. Combine this with the condiments (chilli sauce, ginger/ garlic and a dark soy thing) and it's delicious. The place is big so can easily sit groups and food tends to be fast so don't expect to come here and savour your meal for an hour. This is fast food (but healthy) Singapore style.. Perfect place for lunch. Suggest come at 11:50 latest before the office rush

@TheKuoKnowsIf you are looking for superior service, then Chin Chin is definitely not the place for you. Even moderately acceptable service can be in scant supply, when diners are sitting cheek by jowl or should that be chin to chin. But if all you want is good wholesome food at decent prices - and you don't mind sharing a table with total strangers - then Chin Chin fits the bill superbly.Chin Chin specialises in Hainanese Chicken Rice. It does that to perfection, though "perfection" to lovers of the iconic Singapore chicken dish can be the subject of much debate. That said, Chin Chin must be doing something right, given the long queues that form at lunchtime. So, if you are after a leisurely meal, avoid the rush hour at all cost.Although Hainanese Chicken Rice has to be the order of the day, don't forget the equally iconic Hainanese Pork Chops. Exactly where the dish originated is open to speculation. Some reckon it could be one of the first example of East-West fusion fare, when the much sought-after Hainanese cooks fused Chinese cooking with the European's love of tangy flavours. Whatever the source, Chin Chin'ssauce is as good as I have tasted anywhere.Chin Chin's menu is quite extensive, with enough for the discerning diner to choose from. But with choice chicken and peerless pork on offer, why bother with anything else
5
Forget the fine dining there I none of that . Chin chins offers amazing food at a budget cost ... Full of flavour and amazing local choices . It doesn't look like much from the outside its very basic furniture plastic chairs etc but if you can get through the crowd and leave your fine dining at the door you are in for a treat ... Great local place although a lot of locals did tell me that this is their fine dining compared to other eats ... We loved it and will be back
5
Simple restaurant with excellent and tasty chicken rice! Chicken is so juice and the rice very tasty. They also have different dishes, but I was on the hunt for good C/R.
4
This is a nice restaurant, that was close to my hotel. Good food, quick service and decent price. The staff understand enough English to get you a meal. A good place for a quick bite.
3
Definitely local really street food with a minimal table service but the hiananese chicken and rice is really good and cheap but you do not linger over your meal very quick service
5
Saw this place on Anthony bourdain layover series so thought worth a try , it is right by raffles but seems to be off the tourist trail , went in just before lunch and it was quite busy, by the time I left it was packed and I was the only westerner in there.I had the clay pot mutton with rice that was delicious and a lot of it, great food at a great price with quick service what more could you want :
4
Best time to come is between 2pm to 4pm so to avoid lunch and dinner crowd.Shop house with a hint of 70s nostalgic feel.8.00 SGD for a combo of Roast and Steam chicken for 2 which is served in a good portion. Rice smells perfect and tasty cooked fm chicken broth and ginger. Add few sides vegetables to complete the meal.A NOT TO MISS FOR FOREIGN VISITORS

Chin Chin is a great place to go for Singapore comfort food. Great place to go with local friends and friends and family visiting from overseas because they serve a wide variety of local dishes at great prices. My personal favorites are the Teochew Fish Chowder with Sambal Sweet Potato leaves, washed down by their home made barley water drink.
4
Me and my husband have been to this local restaurant twice already during our weeks stay and we are thinking of going again tonight. We always like to go where the locals eat and this restaurant is certainly one filled with locals. The food is amazing, there is so much choice. I always look around at what the locals are eating and if I like what I see I ask them what it is and try it. At Chin Chin we have had mixed vegetables, seafood and pepper beef which have all been served piping hot and with a smile. A lot of the eating places don't provide napkins so you are always best to carry a pack of tissues with you. It reminds me of a school canteen, it's very basic and cheap and the atmosphere is great with all the locals, we eat and people watch, brilliant.
4
After my wife seeing the advert on television we decided to go for early lunch.On arrival we were met by the staff and seated quickly, we ordered drinks which came promptly and then ordered our food which comprised of chicken and rice, pork chop with sauce, morning glory and chilli.All the food was cooked well and was served hot and no waiting between dishesOverall good food reasonably priced but go early or you may struggle for a sea
5
Many Singaporeans have been eating here for generations. Its good and inexpensive and close to the Central Business District. Best of all, almost no tourists! They've kept the place in it old rustic style and that turns away the tourists, so locals can enjoy it without swarms of tourists taking pictures of everything. And its not a "cool" place to be, so kids aren't taking photos with their phones and tweeting it. A bit noisy and raucous on Friday and Saturday night, but that what I love about the place. A true Singapore gem which doesn't try to be one.
4
This is a true Hainanese Chicken Rice House. The water boiled chicken is cooked the Hainanaese way. That is the meat is well cooked that is unlike the Cantonese version of having some liquid oozing from the bone and more succulent. Hainanese cooks the chicken well to give a better bite texture while the Cantonese is more delicate.The chicken rice is also cooked with a very mild taste of chicken stock from the cooking of the chicken. The rice is lightly coated with chicken oil from the stock. The other dish worthy to note is the fish maw soup. It is cooked the Hainanese way. The mixed vegetable as well. The mixed vegetable is cooked with dried pig's skin, green peas, black fungus, button mushrooms and pork strips.Hainanese chicken rice is not about tenderness of the chicken meat but more emphasis on how the rice is cooked. Tender chicken meat is the Cantonese way
4
Decided to have some simple local food for dinner today after 6 days of feasting and drinking ...
We order omelette with Prawn, Roasted / Steam Hainanese Chicken, Kailan. All are good and tasty. Price wise is reasonable considering it is located in the CBD.
4
Great service, the staff were very helpful and everything was prompt. The food was delicious. We had a vegetable dish which was fresh and healthy. I would definitely return.

I was brought to this popular restaurant with a visiting group of about fifty persons. Tables were booked and meals pre-arranged for lunch by our local host. It is a typical Chinese restaurant serving a wide varieties of dishes with chicken rice as the most sought-after. The steamed chicken was delicious and tender. Other accompanying dishes were good as well. The atmosphere was busy and service was okay. It is located in an area within short distance from several hotels and shopping malls.

Our first meal in SG. We were told this restaurant had the best chicken rice in all of Singapore. It didn't really standout. It's good but not that far or maybe at par with the other restaurants in Singapore.It's located at in the purvis at. foodstrip. Right across there's another good chicken rice with a black signage.I would not go out of my way for this restaurant but if you are in the area, go ahead and try. We ordered roasted chicken and pork chops. average at best.Their milk tea was good though. Consider ordering that.1/2 chicken 13sgdPork chop 6sgdChicken rice 2sgdMilk tea 2sgd

We were around the area and was told the pork chop here is really nice.Despite the fact that all the 3 of us were super full, we thought it was worth trying.We went in and ordered a small pork chop and a drink as all we wanted was to taste the food.The lady who served us was like shocked we only wanted to order one portion and commented "Only ONE portion for 3 persons???!!! The 2 of u not eating???!!!"...and rolled her eyes even after we have told her we were full but really wanted to try the pork chop.She then went to the counter to place order and repeated to her colleague again "3 persons sharing only 1 pork chop".I know it is not very nice but they need not treated us impolitely. And the place was not full at that time.The pork chop came. I have to say the pork chop was nice, crispy. The sauce was tangy but delicious.The wedges were from fresh real potato. The chicken rice was aromatic. The soup was not nice.But service is a big No No. And the senior old workers here seem more hardworking here. For the 20min here, i saw the old age staff servicing more while the younger ones sat around chatting.Would i come back? Probably not. Ohhhh that rude server seemed like a PRC

I am not a fan of Chicken Rice the first time I came here to Singapore until I have tried this place the first time. Since then, I am on the hunt of other places that could be at par or better than Chin Chin. As the place is accessible by walking from Bugis or City Hall MRT, I usually bring my friends who are visiting Singapore to this place.They are a usual Czi Char place that serves Chicken rice. They got loads of items on the menu, but the stand out item for me is the chicken rice. I love their chicken rice! Plump, juicy, and tender chicken on sesame oil and light soy. I dont usually eat chicken skin, but theirs are like slivers of gelatin, smooth and springy, and not fatty. Great to accompany the chicken with their home prepared chilli and grated ginger which are so fine that makes it so good on the chicken because it does not affect the texture but enhances the flavors. The rice is not oily but is very flavorful.I encourage you to try the other czi char items on the menu. I find them not bad, and decently priced. We usually go here as a group, say 4 or 5 personas at a time, and spends only about 60-80sgd for 1 whole chicken, and 3-4 more items from the menu. I say not bad for good quality food that doesn't scrimp on the ingredients.Though the place can be hot and humid at times, especially at lunch time, I actually dont mind much if I knew I am about to have good food! That is how I love this place. Really one of my favorites.Service is not bad at all. Staff are welcoming. I have not experienced waiting long for the orders to arrive even on peak hours. Queues are manageable on peak hours. And really value for money
5
I frequent Chin Chin for decades, thanks to my father. Friends from overseas love the quaint setting and delicate hainanese chicken rice. Despite a brief closure, loyal customers have brought it back to life. Lunch hours are packed with gold/white/blue collar workers from the surrounding offices, so be there early. Other dishes are great too -- pork chop, greens, fu-yong omelett
5
 The four of us had a wonderful dinner at this little hole in the wall tucked in behind the Naumi Hotel. We had the Hainanese Chicken Rice and the Hainanese Pork Chop. Both were exceptional and remarkably inexpensive. There is no air conditioning in the restaurant, so dress casually/comfortably. Do not expect to see it full of tourists; when we were there, it seemed to be all locals, which is strange for a restaurant located in this highly tourist dominated part of the city
4
We ordered 2 types of chicken rice, fried beef koey teow and drinks. Although the price is more expensive than hawker centres, it is air-conditioned. It is a regular local eating house, nothing fancy, but you will not be disappointed. You can find local dishes there in which we were looking for. We eat there because we also stayed nearby and it was convenient
4
we enjoyed a meal here near our hotel, the ladies looked after us superbly, given the place was full, the meal was authentic, the chicken so tender. We loved the atmosphere, feeling like we were amongst the local crowds, and they were so welcoming. would love to return
1
Though food is ok, however service is extremely bad with mainland Chinese waitress who are extremely rude to customers. Poor attitude. Food was not particularly good.
5
Anthony Bourdain came here during one of his trips to Singapore! Must try their hainanese pork chop rice, they usually serve rice that is chicken broth flavoured as they also sell chicken rice. I would prefer to eat the pork chop with plain rice as this brings out the full flavour of the meat and tomato sauce. If still hungry, one can go for second round and order the chicken rice set. Add a chicken liver piece pls...love the minced ginger condiment along with fresh chili sauce. And there u have it, 2 hainanese dishes in one sitting. They sell many stir fry dishes under one roof too and place is mostly air conditioned, ask for a cup of lup han guo during hot weather
4
There were 8 of us, had a spread of about 6 dishes and bill only came up to $13! If you're at Chin Chin, order the chicken rice as a main (it's good but there are equally good ones out there) and the other dishes as sides. Worthy mentions are the hainanese pork chop and "hei zou" (prawn rolls). About as Singaporean as it gets.
5
If you are staying at Raffles or the Fairmont or in that area hen this is located within a minute of your hotel Go here for authentic, fresh, delicious local cuisine. Served quickly or take your time and order several dishes as you go. Lunch for 2 under $15AU without alcohol which isn't served here. It makes a nice change to expensive hotel food and keeps the budget in check
5
The char kway teow noodles and sambal fish I had at Chin Chin was the highlight meal of my stay in Singapore. Simple, tasty, fast and cheap made me a happy customer. Their portions were generous and lemon iced tea was a winner. Thank you Chin Chin
4
If you want fine dining don't go to Chin Chin Eatery....but if you want great, authentic Chinese food your crazy if you don't try this unassuming restaurant in Purvis St. We had Hianese steamed chicken, Tofu & prawns, and pepper prawns washed down with a large bottle of Tiger. For two people the cost was SGD$43.00. The flavours were authentic Asia. The restaurant was totally packed with locals....always a good sign
4
The trip was to try to follow Anthony Bourdain's trail on his Layover at Singapore, and we did not get disappointed. Thankfully we arrived just after the lunch rush hour and most of the staff were just resting. And so the food service was quick. Along with the phenomenal Fish Head Curry we ordered the iconic Chicken Rice, a recommendation of Cereal Crumbed Prawns, and hot pot vegetable ('can't remember the name). We left the place catching our breath from over-eating. It's not fair, but how often one go there to indulge in those stuff :) I will definitely swing by at Chin Chin whenever I get the chance to be in Singapore again
4
A large, no frills and non-air conditioned restaurant with a menu the size of that in a stateside deli. The dish to try is the national dish, Chicken Rice. Very nicely prepared but nothing to draw me back with the other choices in Singapore (try fish head stew or chili crab) Nevertheless, a true Singapore experience that one should try
3
Large place with a big menu. Chicken rice is part of the menu but they serve other things as well. I got the Char Kway Teo and thought it was a little boring, but did have a lot of meat and fish. My friend had sweet and sour fish and prawns which were also just OK. For the area, the price point isn't bad, but I wouldn't make a special trip either. Much cheaper than Mall Food though...
4
I like their Hainanese chicken rice especially their roasted chicken and their sauces that go with it. Sometimes I would just eat solo for their chicken rice. Most times, it is one of our favourite gathering places for cheap eats. Their other dishes are good as well such as pork chop and omelette. Although it can be crowded during lunch time, they will be able to get a seat for you. This place is central but finding a parking lot can be a challenge. Suggested parking is Bras Basah Complex where there are more parking spaces. It is just opposite Purvis Street. Alternatively, there are buses available and nearest MRT is City Hall
4
I ate Hainan Roasted Chicken Rice. With lemon juice, all cost me S$5.5. Succulant chicken, flavorful rice, outdoor seating (not fancy though), speedy service. What more can I ask?
4
A usual go to place for a good family dinner with home cooked dishes. On our recent visits we decided to order their fish head curry. It was good. The serving was enough for 6. We usually order a few dishes such vegetables and hainanese pork chop. No disappointments at all. Everything is good and we always enjoy what we order. Sometimes we order the one dish type meals such as fried rice, hor-fun or deep fried noodles. Chin Chin is also well known for their Hainanese chicken and roast chicken.The place can be very crowded but the staff will try to find you a table to be seated as soon as possible. Just wait a bit and it will be ok. The place can very noisy with everyone talking, so be prepared to raise your voice when you want to talk to each other! Service staff is friendly and don't get in the way of things. The overall feel is that its like an air-conditioned coffee shop in the 70-80s. I like the old fashion nostalgic feel.Car parking is the real challenge but I guess there is little choice for drivers but just to be patient and make their rounds along Purvis Street/Seah Street loop until they find a spot
4
Also friendly service. I spoke at length with Peggy Foo (who says her husband Dennis Lim is the boss) - she was very kind to me and the food was excellent. Both the rice and chicken were cooked to perfection and their chili sauce is just the right degree of spicy. I loved the (very casual) experience.
3
Was very yum for it's price - wouldn't write home about it though. Had the hainanese chicken and pork chop. The pork chop isn't a chop FYI! Was still yum though! The staff were quick but friendly and made me feel very comfortable as a solo diner.
3
Came here for the chicken rice as per previous reviews heard it was the place to go. The rice was still a bit hard, the chicken however was really good, nice and moist. I also ordered the kailan vege which was yum. Good atmosphere here. The staff who I placed the order with and served my food were friendly which was good for a solo diner, they showed me how to mix the sauces etc. Meal was very cheap
5
This is one of the hidden gem thats being overshadow by name such as 5Star, Boon Tong Kee and other name that i think is normal. if you will like to have a taste of true hainanese Chicken Rice this is the place to be at.The steam / Boiled chicken is cook till the correct tenderness and the moisture inside the meat is just nice. the skill is thick and fragrance. (i am a die hard chicken skin Fan). Its a must try for the chicken rice. if your do not want chicken rice there is also other stuff they can cook up . as there is also a zi char too. this place have been me and my girlfriend place to go and get my chicken rice craving fixed. i come at least twice a month. i even brought my client here
4
Stumbled across the restaurant, liked the name and the local look of it. Wasn't disappointed. Had seafood fried rice, kailin (? Some sort of leaf vegetable), eggplant with salted fish - which also had pork in it. The eggplant came in a piping hot, bubbling dish. It was nice and spicy. Whole lunch went down very well with a beer.
3
Went here to have Curry Fish Head but by the time we got where, they had sold out, so we ended up having Hainanese Chicken and Rice, which was still good but could have been better, also found the staff to be a bit rude and pushy, so you would eat and run
2
We came at chin chin eating house because we had read reviews saying that it was the place to eat chiken rice.Well, i guess the reviews were wrong. In this place you will have average food, very bad service in a rather dirty environment and surely not the best chiken rice of your life.Save your money for some other place
3
We came to Chin Chin chicken rice following recommends from other reviewers. However unfortunately it was not up to it for us nor the price. The chicken was ok but the rice was not very appetite. We also ordered a fried 'kang kong', a popular Asian type vegie, which was only ok to us; we encountered an unfamiliar taste of some sort of spice which we felt did not goes well together with the vegie, probably personal preference. At the end of the journey, the price on the bill did not help to improve our satisfaction for the eatery comparing to the one at Maxwell hawker. And it was hot during the late lunch with only some ceiling fans available. As said the chicken saved the day though.One thing we noticed was in Singapore there were no serviette available, you either had to have them with you or buying them at the eatery
4
Prices r cheap, service fast, atmosphere so so but must try their beef and fish hor fun! It's near bugis mrt. Along the shop house near Purvis street. Recommend for budget traveller

Hainanese Chicken, a local favourite in Singapore, is a speciality here, but is not a dish that I find particularly exciting given the range of alternatives available in this city of food. On the other hand, Chin Chin‚Äôs Hainanese style pork chop (coated in a spicy batter with a slightly sweet sauce) was much superior to its colourless chicken counterpart and as good a dish as I tasted on this visit to Singapore. Prawn roll with honey sauce, seafood soup, prawn omelette and chicken soup were all good but the Sambal Kangkong was a real star. Located close to the landmark Raffles Hotel, this locational advantage was reflected in the prices. While it was still great value - the restaurant was packed, mostly with native Straits Chinese but there were also a good smattering of tourists ‚Äì cheaper eateries offering for the most part the same food are dotted around the city. In summary, a mixture of standard fare punctuated with some outstanding dishe

We went for dinner tonight. Walked from our hotel. The Intercontinental. Didn't see chicken rice on menu so we ordered half a chicken and fried rice. We spoke with the people at the table next to us after we ate and they told us you have to tell them you want the rice. Bummer. Luckily we will be here two weeks so will come back again and order correctly! The food we got was good but nothing special so am looking forward to going back to try the real deal.

Food: Known for their spectacular chicken rice, Chin Chin Eating House was still buzzing when we came for dinner in the late evening, after a long shopping expenditure. They also offer a huge range of other dishes that includes various meats such as pork, beef, squid and fish, as well as vegetables.Must Try: Steamed chicken and their fragrant rice which is mixed with oily chicken goodness. The garlic stir fry young bean shoots is also very good!Environment and Service: It‚Äôs loud, it‚Äôs busy and you sit on plastic chairs. If you‚Äôre looking for ambience, then this may not be for you. But it is cooler (in terms of temperature) than most hawker centres and it has a nice local vibe. Service is quick but not very friendly.Price: It‚Äôs a cheap meal at about $15 per person for dinner. We ordered a total of six dishes with rice and non-alcoholic beverages
4
It's a traditional hainanese eatery with modern comfort of good air conditioning. The steam chicken is top quality with chunky smooth meat. Fried chicken, on the other hand, is just average. The mixed vegetables is very tasty and the tofu dish is top notch. All in all, worth a detour to eat here in your next visit to Singapore.
3
The food is fine execute, the chicken rice, the pork chop even the fried bean sprouts are lovely. The service is also good, quick and attentive. It does not offer the best of SG food, but a very nice place to eat good food and enjoy
4
Specifically wanted some good chicken rice and Chin Chin's did not disappoint. The chicken was succulent and fragrant but the rice was not quite as nice as some others I have tried. We also ordered some other dishes like the fish slices with spring onion (average), stir fried baby Kailan with sambal (yum) and hot plate tofu (average). Service was attentive though for such a busy restaurant, I would go back again maybe just for the chicken rice this time.
4
Visited Chin Chin as I had been on a tour all day and felt peckish at about 4.30pm.I ordered Chicken rice and there was no fuss. Food was delivered quickly and was very tasty.Utensils and condiments were on the table already so it easy.For that time of the day,there were plenty of locals in there and the atmosphere was relaxed.Will definitely return as the food was good and very reasonable
5
Can't believe we lucked out and stumbled upon this little eating gem in Singapore. When I returned to work and told my colleague (born and bred in Singapore) where we ate he was very surprised as it's more a local eating place. After an expensive bar bill at Raffles, we wandered the nearby streets looking for something local and a little less expensive. There was a lot of nice restaurants to choose from on Purvis Street but Chin Chin was 75% full on a Monday night and had a great buzz about it. The guy in the front window serving chicken rice also had a nice smile. It's not about the decor - a simple big white diner, with large and small tables with vinyl stacking chairs, your spoons and spices on the tables, ceiling fans spinning and mosquito zappers on the walls. But it's big, not overcrowded and very clean with a good atmosphere.Staff were very attentive (those Chinese lessons our kids are getting at school helped charm a few of the ladies). Fantastic selection of food and you could easily go no further than the recommended specials. I tried the local Hokkien Mee and the other half had Kung Po Chicken (loads of chilli! yum). We also had a serious case of food envy from what we saw being brought out on the other tables (damn filling up on those Raffles peanuts). Wish we found this place earlier on the trip.
5
Just near our Hotel and what a find it was full of locals and the owner was really helpful as one of our party is vegetarian he helped us chose dishes advised we share our Tiger beer apologised that the 54 dollar bill for four was expensive due to the beer! I think not the food was lovely and his was the cheapest drink we had

We went there for breakfast so they just offer toast and eggs. Too bad the chefs only comes in at 11am. The hainanese coffee is good and toast is well prepared.
5
Bustling place full of locals. Quick service with a smile, only thing they were slow with was bringing the bill.
Great quality food, and masses of it. All for less than 40 dollars for 2 of us.

Chin Chin was highly recommended to us by the staff at the Fairmont
It's a true taste of old Singapore
Definitely try the thai tofu, char kway teow and of course.... the chicken rice
Liked it so much we ate there twice

Famous for their chicken rice and other a la carte local dishes are also worth a try.
Very crowded during lunch time so best to go slightly earlier before the lunch crowd packs in at noon. Highly recommended for Singapore famous Hainanese chicken rice.

Just up the road from Raffles Hotel is this old school eating house jambed full of locals eating Hainan Chicken Rice (amongst other favorites). Do yourself a favour & order Chicken Rice, green vegies & beer and budget on about $12.00- $15.00 each. Melt in the mouth, succulent chicken will keep you wanting more. Avoid the bathrooms if possible

Ok Ok so we're British, and abroad so what do we know?What I can tell you is that pop down Purvis road round the corner from Raffles there are a number of local restaurants where the locals go, this time we went to Chin ChinGreat selection, we had a Chinese clay pot curry, that was just fantastic and we chose the vegetarian option, some great Singapore noodles, a really tasty crispy beancurd with a chilli tomato sauce and a few other bitsnbobsFood is served within minutes, how do they do that and was all superbWhen ordering don't get carried away with the $15 dollar sizes, go for the $10 size or you will be full to up in no time, unless it's a clay pot curry that isOnly a couple of beers on the menu and there is limited English from the staff, so ordering is pot luck unless you know what you are ordering, there isn't much point in asking is the chilli chicken hot?We love it down this road, safe, reliable eat on the pavement or inside, and a bargain, masses to eat beer all for $50 Singapor

Visited Chin Chin recently after a lapse of more than 5 years. The Hainanese pork chop has gotten much better. The last time I ordered this dish, the meat was too dry. This time, I believe the cut of pork used was less lean so it was quite juicy. However, this still pales in comparison to the "real" Hainanese pork chop that I used to have in Koek Lane when I was in my teens

We were walking along Purvis Street not knowing where to eat as there were several food outlets around the area. We decided on this when we saw many locals eating there. It must be popular and good. Its easy to know if a restaurant serves good food in Singapore, If there are many people waiting on queue, then that means the place is popular. We had chicken rice, fried ngo hian ( fried spring roll , but with more ingredients) and brinjal fried with salted fish in a claypot. The first 2 dishes were ok but the 3rd dish was too sweet for us though, 2 plates of yellow rice and 2 cups of luo han quo / herbal drink. Our bill came up to about Sgd34. I think for Singapore standard, the price is ok

Place was absolutely packed with locals and a few tourists. Lucky to grab a table . Service quite good , once the first dish had arrived . Thai tofu very tasty as was the mixed vegetable dish we ordered. Crispy duck dish .excellent .All dishes were large , probably over ordered.. They will box it up if you do not finish .Total bill was less than √Ç¬£17.00 for two  Not the best place if you want a quiet romantic evening ...noise is part of the atmosphere

We went here on a recommendation from a local friend and were not disappointed.We had 1/2 a steamed chicken and some other bits and pieces. The food was delicious and we were pleasantly surprised by the amount of chicken in the 1/2 chicken. It was packed with locals which is always a great sign. Good down to earth, good value eatery with good food
5
We ordered 1/2 chicken of mixed and steamed chicken for a party of 2. Food arrived fast and were were not disappointed. 1/2 chicken is a good meal for 2 people.
4
Chin Chin specialty is chicken rice and pork chop. I say the chicken rice is good, but the pork chop is just ordinary.
Order the chicken rice and enjoy yourself like a singaporean in this small and crowded restaurant !
5
Simple, tasty, good value and staff are friendly. The chicken was amazing. The waiter gave helpful suggestions about specialties. Nothing to fault. Just great food.

Another old timer for chicken rice and pork chops. Old styled restaurant just like Yet Con. But the chicken rice is slightly better while the pork chops are far from Yet Con's standard
4
It's as Singaporian as it gets. A very local joint with very local food. The service was good. The food was good. The price was WELL worth the food.

We happened on this place as it was close to our hotel. It was bustling at 7.30 on a Saturday but we were lucky to jag a table without waiting. We were the only caucasians in the place which seemed like a good sign! The food came quickly & was delicious & excellent value. I would highly recommend the Pork spare ribs-finger licking good! Don't go for the "favourite" pork "chop" it looks like overcrumbed chicken schnitzel

I don't often get excited about restaurants - they either serve what I ordered or they don't. But Chin Chin Eating House has consistently delivered fantastic food that is worth going back for. I've been going here since 2009 and the quality remains excellent. The restaurant is your classic Singaporean shop house - replete with formica tables and plastic seats. But who cares? If you want decor, then go to Marina Bay Sands! Try the bean sprouts with salted dried fish (tastes a million times better than it sounds) and the Prawn Omelette. One word: YUM! If you're looking for great, affordable and traditional Singapore food then head up to Purvis Street

Always happy every time I come here. Sitting by the roadside watching local crowds flow in for dinner along other restaurants on the street, bantering at the next table of precariously parking their cars next to your table.Food is generally good enough but it can be heavy with msg! Drink lots of water

This place serves one of the best Chicken Rice in town. You could try it the steamed version as well as the roasted version. The portions are huge; one portion is enough for 3 or 4 people.Try as well the Sweet Potatoes Leaves Belacan. Yummy

We visited Chin Chin Eating House during our recent trip to Singapore. It was bustling and full of local people as well as a few scattered tourists.We ordered the pork chop, steamed chicken rice and vegetable clay pot curry. The food was very good value for money but wasn't what we were expecting. The pork chop was more like a schnitzel and the chicken rice was average, not very warm and rather unappetising. Having said that, I think the food is exactly what it's meant to be, and can't be blamed for not being to our taste.Overall quite a good experience and excellent value for money
5
The place is always hot and busy, but you get a menu and also a waiter is coming, no self-service. Many options, pepper beef on hot plate was great. I am always impressed how they manage the crowd, go there and see the real life!

Enjoyed the traditional chicken rice and mee goreng at Chin Chin. We went during the midweek lunch rush and service was prompt and friendly. The chicken rice was delicious.

Good local Chinese food, lots of locals eat here so I'm sure that's a tell tale sign!
5
This place is well reviewed and featured on TV programs about food and world travel. That is what brought us there. The chicken and rice was delicious and the price was good. The service was friendly and I can recommend this place!
5
Yumm... they have so many delicious dishes!! Like chicken rice, mutton soup, fried rice, etc. Also try their home-made soyabean drink!
5
After eating at plenty of the restaurants with a view we wanted something quick & tasty.
This place does not let you down... food around ¬£5 a dish... Tiger Beer at ¬£3.50 a large bottle... and v friendly, hot,tasty food.
Brilliant!

This is my place where I got my lunch almost everyday, I always picked the menu instead of the chicken rice, even one of my ang moh friends became a regular.
Their friendly staff maybe something that I rarely found around.

Despite being just around the corner from the salubrious Raffles Hotel, Chin Chin is a wonderful piece of old Singapore; an extensive menu of delicious Chinese food (the chicken rice is superb!) served in down-to-earth shop-house style. Doctors, lawyers, bricklayers and bus drivers all share the throng at this hugely atmospheric and incredibly cheap restaurant

My friend and I wanted to try another restau, but then the queue was very loong.So instead, we walked further down Purvis and decided to have dindin at Chin Chin Eating House.Apparently, the restaurant has been around since 1950s. It does feel like it. Hehe! It reminds me of those very old Chinese restaus back in Manila that didn't seem to bother to update the interiors. Chinese paintings on the walls, round tables with stools, no AC. One way of looking at this decision is that it gives an authentic feel of how the restau was like when it started. :POn to the more important part, the food. The menu selection was quite extensive. There was beef, pork, chicken, mutton, soup, rice, and so on. There was a separate listing for Hainanese dishes.Because I was starving and because both of us were not feeling well, we quickly decided to just get chicken and seafood vegetable soup. The steamed chicken was $13 while the seafood vegetable soup was $6 (we got the medium). We also each got a bowl of rice to go with the dishes. Total bill with drinks was $24. Not bad I must say. :)The service was quite fast and the serving was generous. Seriously, the chicken was good enough to be shared by three people. Same goes for the soup. We were really both surprised to see a huge plate of chicken and a huge bowl of soup when the dishes arrived.There are other tastier chicken rice places around Singapore, that's for sure. But if you happen to be in the Bugis area and you just want a quick, nice meal, you definitely should head down to Chin Chin Eating House

We were going to Yet-Con but it was not open yet so we stopped by Chin Chin instead. We ordered the chicken (steamed), chicken rice, veggie, Hainan pork chop and chicken rice. All the dishes tasted ok, but nothing stood out. I was disappointed with the pork chop as I had higher expectation based on other reviews. And the chicken, well, after tasting the chicken and rice at Tian Tian (Maxwell hawker center), the same dishes at Chin Chin were a notch below. I guess they have a signature dish (mutton soup in claypot ) which is only offered on the weekend but we didn't order it since we were not crazy about muttons. Overall, an average dining experience
