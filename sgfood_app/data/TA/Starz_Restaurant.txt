This was the restaurant that breakfast was included during our stay at Sentosa for conference. The quality, standard and choice of food for breakfast was amazing. The cleanliness of restaurant was immaculate.
4
Nice ambience, quiet enough to have a nice meal with family. Spread is good and sashimi is fresh. Cold and hot drinks are also included.
4
the spread for the buffet was decent and food was generally good. the service was prompt and we had a generally pleasant experience in consideration that this is buffet food after all.
2
stayed at Hardrock and went in for breakfast, we went is about half an hour after opening so all food was out, a lot of hot food was cold and of poor quality, I ate toast and jam for around $39.00 because most everything else was dried out and hard, the little pancakes were like bricks, would not eat here agai

My review may be a little lengthy so below is a quick rating to help with potential visitors who do not want to read through my ramblings. Service - 4 / 5Food Quality - 4 / 5Food Variety - 2.5 / 5Ambience - 2.5 / 5Value for Money - 3/5To start, the staff at Starz have been very friendly and reasonably attentive so my 3/5 rating is definitely not due to poor service. Though I have to add that the chefs behind the counter are not always there and they do not provide the same level of service as compared to other restaurants of the same range - i.e. attend to diners immediately when they are at the food counter. I gave up on the pork knuckle station as there was never anyone there to cut the meat up and serve it.Food quality wise there are no complaints either. The main draw of the buffet spread at Starz is the seafood and they are relatively fresh. This is where the good review ends.For a buffet dinner of this price, the variety of food offered is very limited. While the seafood spread had quite a good selection and offered snow crab on top of the standard clams, scallop and prawns, they did not serve oyster. And once you move beyond the seafood section, there isn't much variety to choose from. Off the top of my head, I can count the no. of dishes that are offered. And that speaks loads. Most times one would be spoilt for choice at a buffet dinner of this price range, and certainly will not be able recall the total no. of dishes offered. I found myself bored by my second round at the buffet counter.However, what I find most disappointing about Starz is the interior, overall ambience and food presentation. The main dining hall is dull and the furniture uninspiring. The general consensus amongst my dining companions was that it felt like we were dining at a local food court. Then there's the background music. I understand the restaurant is situated within Hard Rock Hotel, but this is not Hard Rock Cafe (the interior is certainly did not suggest so), so the loud music that ranged hip hop to rap to rock certainly did not enhance our dining experience.Lastly, the food presentation at the buffet counter did little to make the food look appetizing. The seafood was placed on a small bed of ice about 60 by 30 cm with low lighting. Even the Peng Kang (BBQ) stall at a neighborhood hawker center knows how to present their seafood better - with a large bed of ice and good selection of seafood spread out to show variety and freshness. And this was supposed to be their star offer. The attention was instead given to the limited choice pre-cooked food. One may argue that I was being picky and fussy and that I should just focus on the food. To that, my reply would be that I did objectively qualify at the start of my review that the food quality is good. But ultimately, beyond the food (which is limited in variety), what distinguishes one restaurant from another would be the overall dining experience. And there are restaurants that offer better value for money for the price that I have paid.Improve on the dull interior (do away with the black walls behind the buffet counters, brighten up the lighting over the food, change out the industrial stainless steel dining tables) and improve on the buffet selection, and definitely I'll make my way back to Starz. Otherwise, doubt I'll be coming back anytime soon, nor recommend any friends to dine here

Had dinner here during a conference trip and the variety of food is ok if you are into the Asian flavor. Clean and spacious.
5
Truly enjoyed the food varieties at breakfast. Suggest to buy it together with your room booking. Staff are well trained and all smiles, which made the breakfast morning with a great start. Keep it up

I was yesterday with my sister for the lunch buffet and it was a very pleasant experience. The seafood wasn't really 'clean', as my sister felt itchy in her mouth when she has eaten seafood which are not that fresh. However, the briyani rice, vegetable curry, herbal mutton and beef dish is really fantastic. The red meat dishes is strongly recommended as the meat melts in your mouth. One weird occurrence is that the mutton becomes sweeter when we went to the buffet table later to get another serving. The vegetable dish, fried finger food (fish tempura) and the fish curry are examples of dishes which you could skip. The fish in the fish curry wasn't well handled, I remove the skin of the fish because bits of scales found. The fish doesn't smell nice. It could be better if it was fillet and fried before adding into the curry sauce. The dessert was pretty complete with strawberry ice cream, corn ice cream, cakes and jellies. (yes, they have soya bean milk and grass jelly too) Tea and coffee provided if you don't like ice water. I don't understand why people don't like this buffet, there are more buffet out there thats not far behind when you compare them to this one. Good place to spend time with family and friends. Good job. Friendly staff and the food smells good! (No fishy seafood smell even when I mentioned that the seafood is not really that 'clean'.

Always an enjoyable time spent at Starz with great service especially from the Restaurant service duty manager who remembers my family even after a break from last visit to Starz Restaurant
5
Good buffet restaurant,yummy food, both breakfast and dinner; clean environment and good service
2
You will easily get tired of the limited and unvarying options every morning. Room gets too crowded and the lighting is too dim
4
The spread was limited and largely made up of local cuisine but there were some good dishes like the curry prawns, laksa, satay, corn-chicken soup and century egg porridge. I liked that we could make our own rojak and salad. Enjoyed the gelato and some desserts. The biggest plus for us would be that the place is family friendly
5
My family loves Starz Restaurant and we will always go there for any celebrations. The food are presentable and nice too
3
We were here after checking out from the RWS hotel. We just needed a place for lunch before heading home. The 1 for 1 is quite good deal. There isn't many choices but the food are nice. The white poached prawns are very fresh. The laksa king crabs are fresh too but a bit weird to go with laksa taste. I also like the nasi biryani with curry mutton
5
Very good service, requested for a quiet seat and the waitress was very helpful in helping us get a seat. Variety choice of food too.
2
Been here several times before and spreads were good then. It's been more than a year since last visited and was really surprise to see it's deterioration of spreads. Used to have more varieties and now even the laksa is not good. Limited sushi spreads and no more of crab claws. The pork knuckle was hard and skin not crispy at all. The only item that's not bad is the beef stew so really for the price you have to pay, it not worth your money at all. Definitely will try other dining alternatives when visit to RWS in the future
3
As buffet breakfasts go, it was OK. Nothing spectacular, nothing terrible. The price is a bit high for what you get. If you are a family, two kids can eat free with the two paying adults which makes the price more reasonable overall. We were two adults so it was no bargain for us. Quite the opposite. If you find yourself at the Resorts World complex staying, it is an OK breakfast option. Separate reviews are written for the other attractions within Resorts World
4
Went to their dinner buffet 2 times. Great selection of continental food, love the prawns and salmon sashimi. Discovered that they have waffles on the 2nd visit and it was delicious! The dessert was not impressive though
5
We visited with a group of 6 containing 2 small kids. The kids loves the desserts and got to try some Nyonya desserts and dishes. The food was fresh and tasty. The dhall was amazing. My only concern was that there could be more options for vegetarians in the savoury food section. Our traveling partners loved the seafood too. The kids ate free with two paying adults which made it a great deal. Staff were very friendly and efficient at removing our used plates
1
Food is way too out in the open and everyone is coughing on it. Feels more like a cafeteria. It is not even close to offering a good buffet and beyond that it is expensive. Really probably the worst restaurants we dined at while we were there
1
First, we were greeted and asked the drinks in Chinese though we spoke English first, not the usual expectation from a hotel.The food variety is very limited. Sashimi only salmon, small crabs, claws and prawns for seafood. A handful of cooked stuff that is mild warm. Salad, very saltish Ikan bilis soup noodle, small section of Indian food, some mutton and a small section on dessert. We lost our appetite in the mid of our main...and ended our dinner less than an hour. I think they could do better, else just serve ala carte.
2
Went to Starz for their high tea on good friday holiday. The place was clean and that is the only good thing about Starz.The spread was limited and not impressive at all. The chicken curry was salty. The tou fu for the gado gado was hard. Tou fu....hard!!!??Wonder if the restaurant have tried the food themselves? The buffet spread looked very dull. The dessert was a let down too. What more can you expect for $36++. However, if you are not fussy over any food, you can try Starz. The lady who was sitting beside me must have liked the food or make her money worth. She was going round after round non stop. Starz is a one time visit for me. Not going there again.
4
Starz restaurant has lots of options to choose for delicacies for different cuisines like Indian, Continental. Chinese etc. Service is good and staff are very nice
4
Buffet restaurant that served many kind of food, like salad, sushi, pasta, steak, cakes, vegetables, fish, ice cream, and cookies
5
Visited the restaurant multiple times for buffets. Warm smiles everywhere. Want to give a shout out to the lady chef behind the food counter , Yap Yong. When she saw my son taking the quail's eggs, she offered to warm them up and even added some beehoon. And she advised me to use the double-boiled pork rib soup for him. That basically made up a well-balanced lunch for him! Thanks everyone for the hospitality!
3
The venue and ambience is great. Food quality is ordinary nothing spectacular to come back for. Pricey for the quality of food that they serve. We ate here only to claim my RWSinvites$.
4
This was our breakfast venue for the duration of our stay at Hard Rock Hotel. Very efficient service with quick seating. AS we were a group of 10 there were occasions we had to wait a few minutes while waiters put some tables together but this was promptly done.Plates were cleared from table efficiently and quickly with friendly, obliging wait staff.Hats off to the chef for taking on board our suggestion to increase variety of indian/asian cuisine that was offered for breakfasts - well received and promptly actioned suggestion. Couldnt really ask for more.cheersJeela

Breakfast was good value at $20 and $10 for Kids. Variety of food on offer was good, They will make you a omelette and noodles whilst you wait which were good.generally walked out wishing that I stopped a plate earlier. Coffee was good enough and you can ask for a better one from the bar area as well. Did not get to dinner as we were put off by the price. $68 and $34 on Friday and Saturday was to much. Kids should just pay for their age, Kids aren't going to eat a lot anyway, this would make it more enticing for Adults to fork out the extra cash. Instead we went to the forum and had dinner there most nights
3
Had breakfast here when staying at Hard Rock Hotel. spread for $20 breakfast but coffee from dispenser was sour. Had to stand at the laksa station for almost 5min to catch someone attention just to get a little bowl of laksa which isn't great anyway. Nasi lemak is not fancy with only ikan bilis with peanuts, cucumber and samba chilli.
5
Went there for Breakfast and the spread was good. The staff were efficient and we didnt wait for very long for a table even though the restaurant was full
1
Failure to allocate better seating, don't have seating planning, staff/manager keep telling us , we should get ballroom or function room but not that we don't want, it's fully booked. Events was like in a mess.Breakfast was OK
4
We availed of their buffet breakfast. If you are a big eater a SGD$20.00 is a fair price, but if a coffee and a sandwich is enough to break your morning hunger, you forget this buffet breakfast, and go instead to fast food, like McDonald's. However, if money is not an issue, this is a nice place to have your breakfast. Plenty of choices, overflowing coffee, tea and juices
4
Great breakfast selection (all you can eat). Great place to have your breakfast before a long day wondering around Singapore
4
I didn't like Starz Restaurant for its lack of variety. However, went recently on a public holiday and the selection was good! The seafood was fresh, and the dishes were tasty! We enjoyed ourselves!However, service could have been improved. Water was not re-filled. Plates were not cleared promptly. Wanted to cut food into smaller pieces for my baby. Was told by a waitress that the restaurant don't have a scissors to help me. Went to the buffet counter and spoke to a sous chef who was extremely hesitant and was about to reject my request when the head chef noticed, and took over. He was very professional and took the effort to take the scissors from the kitchen and boiled it in the soup base before helping to cut it meticulously into small pieces. Grateful to the head chef for stepping up, but was a bit disappointed by the first two "rejects". Hope the selection continues to be so delicious
3
The food choice is ok it's not wide and extensive. They could use more variety especially more fruit and pastry option.
3
We had breakfast buffet here one morning and didn't rate it too highly. It was ok, but more aimed at the asian market, not westerner
3
good service staff especially those who serve breakfast, breakfast starts at 730am if you are business traveller might not be a good place to have breakfast...
4
When for the dinner buffet and it was not bad. They had a good mix of food and the salmon sashimi was delicious. They provided plastic utensils for kids, so I guess that they took feedback from a previous posting seriously. The waiters were friendly and even took time to talk to the kids. Will go back again when I visit the hotel
3
There is no plastic plate as a family friendly restaurant! Staffs are helpful and friendly. Food variety is okay. Restaurant layout is very packed. Feel like having breakfast in super busy lunch hour
4
lovely choice of food and great service, really enjoyed the dinner buffet. Staff very attentive and a great range of dishes.
5
it's a very nice place for family to dine-in, cause the foods there are of all types of peoples, espically the seafood on ice, i ove it so much, that i have to go there so many times, and i can't stop eating it.
3
If you are hungry during dinner, it got good variety and selection for suited most taste. their dessert selection is good.
avoid lunch there, unlike dinner, poor selection
4
Located ta Hard Rock Hotel. We went there for dessert. Good value, good price, nice ambience, nice cakes too.
4
Ambience was very good, , very scenic outdoor.
As a vegetarian had very limited choice.
Courteous service.
Little more spacious, it will be still better.
2
Very basic breakfast for a 5 star hotel! Only one type of milk available and doesn't have peanut butter of jam in tubs still uses big bowls:(
3
We only eat here for the complimentary breakfast, the fod is average, everyday is the same, place and table is not that clean, lack of staff.
5
very good food and affordable price.located just outside universal studios. friendly staff and quick servic
2
No much variety and the taste just not up to standard being a 5-star restaurant. I ordered cappuccino from a Chinese waiter but he doesn't know what is that. Maybe more training to their staff is needed
5
Everything in this restaurant is great. Starting from great service to diversity of food. The best Alaskan Crab i ever eaten. Unlimited choices from different kind of food you will find in this restaurant. I had my birthday and was the best place to celebrate it.
5
Two thumbs UP!! Going out to Mr Ariel & Mr Boon Huan. Never failed to greet guests at all times. Especially Mr Ariel, his helpfulness to get us a 20pax reservation at the Hard Rock Cafe on such a busy festive season day. Heartfelt thanks, Ariel! A family reunion dinner wouldn't be possible without U.. Love ur smile :))
2
Buffet selections were limited, food wasnt fantastic. Ambience: noisy. Service: average.
Overall: wouldnt return
4
The food was average, but the sashimi station had a good serving and variety of sashimi.
We also love the chees platter served.
Current deal where up to 3 kids dine for free for every 2 adults makes it all worthwhile for us.
5
Starz restaurant is situated inside Hard Rock Hotel at RWS. Nice and many variety of dishes during breakfast. Prices are reasonable. Staffs are courteous and friendly. Worth restaurant for dinning for food.
2
came for the hi tea but the food standard has drop drastically from few months back. they feedback its because they are having promotion so some of the menu items has changed. even so from $28++ is not worth it at all. will surely not return for an occasion
3
We arrived to a long queue at the lobby but it cleared up pretty quickly as staff showed each group to their table. Staff were professional and service was impeccable. They were prompt in clearing away the used dishes and serving the drinks and ketchup when my kids asked for them.Spread of food was so-so (not fantastic, but reasonable I'd say), with a few popular local dishes like chilli crab & braised chicken. My firstborn & husband had their fill of sashimis, and there were some cold seafood. There was also some salads to choose from. If you have a sweet tooth, the dessert spread should keep you going for seconds. Overall, taste wise was above average, though not of 5-star standard. We were there to celebrate our wedding anniversary. However, the ambience was way too noisy with the crowd. It is more like an orderly food court crowd and definitely regretful for a anniversary celebration. Though this is no fault of the hotel. We had chosen the restaurant for the promotion and to take our kids on a local buffet experience (we've taken the kids to many overseas but none locally).I was told we would receive a complimentary slice of cake for the occasion when I made the reservation, but none was served. Well, we had our fill at the dessert station and did not bother to enquire. Although a slice with a message card would have wrapped up the celebration beautifully
3
~S$33/adult and ~S$16.50/child (including taxes). Had breakfast here because I had vouchers to spend and there was a "Kids eat for free with 2 paying adults" promotion. The usual spread: eggs station, bacon, sausages, hashbrown, baked beans, pancakes, fried beehoon, nasi lemak, siew mai, mini 'png kueh', salads, fruits, cereals, yogurt, bread, mini muffins, danish pastries, plain porridge with condiments, century egg congee. Everything tastes average, congee was a bit plain
2
My family and I had lunch there as we were having a staycation and didn't want to venture out too far.While the price is alot cheaper than dinner, so is the quality and variety of food. But fortunately, the staff service more than make up for the poor food.What I find horrendous was that a beef item wrongly labelled as pork - this is not acceptable at a 5-star hotel
5
Go for buffet dinner ,$55++, the food are fresh and nice , not much choose but food replace very fast , love the service there, the staff all have nice smile and help keep the table clean. Just 1 thing that the table between next table are near, so what u talk other table people can hear and the table beside me keep looking at the food I eat, This part I dun feel privacy.
4
Starz (Hard Rock Hotel): very friendly staff. We always arrive 5 min before they close for breakfast and they always take us in and rush us to a table advising to gran what we need from the buffet. Helpful and always smily staff, Nothing much special in it but for the price we pay it is great verity and feed the purpose Nice decor and view of the poo
2
The staff service is magnificent. They tried their best to serve n match request. They cleared the plates very fast too for dinner buffet. Thumbs up!However, the dinner buffet food standard has dropped. For eg. the kuehs were not fresh -the banana in the banana kueh tasted like a rock, laksa too watery n tasted different from last time. No oyster this time ( were told by manager due to shipment problem), the crabs too salty. Used to enjoy the oyster, sashimi, laksa, dessert n kuehs, but this time, other than the sashimi, the rest of the food doesn't taste like last time anymore. It used to be one of my favorites, but disappointed now.
5
We had breakfast every morning and also had lunch a couple of days. The food was amazing and the buffet had a great selection to choose from. The staff was also really professional, welcoming and friendly.
5
Dinner Buffet 5 Stars in Every WayI absolutely loved this place. The menu selection was massive. I’m vegetarian and didn’t see this listed on TripAdvisor under the vegetarian category, but wow the selections available were amazing. There was a spaghetti with tomato sauce, rice biryani, an Indian curry, fried potato skins, basil artichoke tomatoes dish, green salad, an amazing soft potato salad, gourmet breads, sushi avocado rolls, sea asparagus, cooked carrots, a huge array of deserts, and I’m not even covering it all. My wife also enjoyed the non-vegetarian options especially squid in a red sauce, fresh large oysters, salmon, and a lamb dish she thought was pork. Really there was something for everyone here and the options were endless.We didn’t experience any of the negatives mentioned in some other reviews. The more expensive food was not rationed, and the food was all hot and fresh. The staff were incredible. We were asked twice if we wanted drinks, but only wanted water. Our glasses remained full as they constantly came around topping up our cups. When checking bill we were asked if we’d like coffee or tea. Then after handing a VISA card I was informed if I have a mastercard I could save 10%. Then as doing this they noticed my room key and said oh actually any card works, I just need that key and your name and you get 20% off. That was a nice surprise. My key was for Festive Hotel, which is next door. This shop is inside The Hard Rock. We were asked at the payment counter if we enjoyed our meal and were thanked on the way out. The entire experience eating here was 5-stars

This is one of the restaurants to go if you want to have a romantic time with your loved ones in Sentosa especially if both of you love purple. Not sure if it is an ideal place to propose as it can be quite crowded with children running around screaming for their mommies, etc.But don’t worry you can request to be seated at certain sections of the restaurant that offer more privacy. After all you are in Starz Restaurant and you are the star. Personally I prefer to sit near the window if I am with a woman friend, but not too near the washroom area for obvious reasons.Another good reason for going there on a date other than the excellent service by their staff, is the desserts. Simply love them! Sweet but not overwhelming. Just the way you want your date to be.Enjoy

I can say, after experience so many buffet restaurant in Singapore, Starz restaurant buffet is the best among all the ones I've tried. They have excellent service, excellent food, and a good ambience. What should be improve will be the ice cream. Although it's just an ice cream, I think it should still be made pretty good. The ice cream they served doesn't really melt in the mouth fast enough despite the fact that it's gelato. Maybe you can replace some unpopular ice cream like black berry with pistachio gelato:) I think that will be better. Another thing will be the dessert. I've saw panna cotta on the shelf. As you know, normally desserts are being eaten in the last. When I've finished all my food and decided to go for the dessert, I find that there is no panna cotta, tiramisu and many more. I sincerely hope that you will have more supplies of the food next time I dine in starz restaurant. The Portuguese egg tart was so awesome! It's like made to perfect, good job. The laksa was also quite good, the laksa was quite thick, and taste was just right. Oyster were the best, they were fresh and clean. I meant clean as there are no shell pieces in the oyster. I've tried oyster in other places but their oyster tends to have some shell pieces in it so it's harder for me to eat in piece. Lastly, I must commend the manager on that day as he has prepared a good surprise for my sister :)good job.
3
There are very few music relics here, add to that the absurd cost for every drink on their menu and you're going to have an average time. There is free wifi, which is a bonus and it is clean. It's nicely airconditioned and there seating is comfortable

I visited Starz on 27 April 2014 with my family to celebrate my mum birthday with a booking of 10 pax. This is my second visit where I had a good experience in late 2013. Overall the experience this time was disappointing. Only complimentary area was the quality of staff service at the dining area where they ensured plates were cleared and drinks were adequately refilled. Including the host lady, everyone was pleasant to us. However the food was really bad. Despite that this was the selection for a Sunday/weekday spread, the choice was way too limited and it felt like a local buffet instead of the proclaimed international spread. At 7 plus, the chef already declared that the already limited sashimi (2 types only) was sold out and they kept most of the oysters inside the kitchen. Occasionally a small plate of oyster will be served to feed the large waiting crowd. Due to my complaint, restaurant mgr did try to help to offer sashimi and oyster to my table but the waiting time was too long and this was rather unfair to the other tables I must admit. Due to the limited choice I turned to two bowls of laksa which tasted pretty decent. Other local cuisines including hainanese chicken and roast pork were too hard. Even the Indian curry chicken felt like it had been recooked too many times. Most of the cooked food had the same problem. Either tasteless or hard. Key points:- overpriced for the spread selection. - food was not fresh and not replenished until it was really finished. - more expensive dishes were rationed to reduce consumption.- my previous visit was mind blowing and this return visit certainly confirmed that standards have dropped tremendously. Could be cost cutting initiative. - waiter and restaurant mgr were helpful but they cannot change the food quality. I am so disappointed and I really regretted for bringing my big family to such a place.

Went on 24th April 2014 for dinner, service staffs were very friendly and attentive. But was very disapoointed with the display of the food and the quality of the food. 3 quarter of the food are local food. Herbal Prawn is tastless, Curry chicken abit sour and most of the food is not even warm. Kitchen staff at the buffet counter working like a robot. Plates for sashimi is hot, like just came out of the washer or from the plate warmer.There were so many big group tourist in the restarant and the children were running around. The whole restaurant was so noisy.The most ridiculous is the PVC of the seat is peeling off so badly. I can't believe this is coming out of HRC hotel. No standard at all.WORST than eating in a hawker center
4
The service staff and kitchen staff were smiley, friendly, attentive and approachable. They make us feel good the moment we stepped in and I think this is important as it gives our dining experience a good headstart. The food selection was wide despite the short buffet display area and the food were surprisingly fresher than I thought! There was a big variety to choose from! Chinese, Korean, Indian, Japanese and some local delicacies. The desserts were also a good mix of western, nonya and local! We did not get to try everything because we were stuffed! Will be back again soon
4
We dined here on our last night in Sentosa so we could all have our own choices. The food was varied and of a good quality stretching over a few cuisines. We experienced great service with very little waiting time for drinks and table service.Although the price is at a premium (on par with Sentosa), when I return to Sentosa I would dine here again and recommend anyone looking for a decent buffet to attend
4
If this is the restaurant located in the Hard Rock Hotel (as there were 2) we had the buffet breakfast there daily and it was quite a nice meal, they catered for everyone from local food, western food to curries, there was even a special place setting provided for kids
5
Absolutely delicious food served in the Starz Restaurant in the Hard Rock Hotel. Also excellent a la carte dishes.
4
Service was excellent. Staff Vanessa gave us very good service. Very pleased with her service.
Food was good. Local food, laksa, drunken prawn, roti prata all very good
4
Located in the Hard Rock hotel, Starz Restaurant presents a great spread of buffet! .... Ambience is cosy with nice sittings and lightings! A great place to wrap up team events!
4
Food delicious and staff friendly - lots of choice and could eat as much as we wanted to. Lots of tables and o queues.
5
We had the pleasure of eating at Starz after an exhausting hot afternoon going around Sentosa. I have to say that after an unsatisfying visit to the Aquarium, dolphin show and history museum, this dinner buffet was the highlight of our Sentosa experience. Even the Song of the Sea show we saw after dinner cannot top this grand food fest. The fresh oysters, the sashimi, the beef tenderloin, the foie gras on custard, the bah kut teh, the macarons for dessert - all top notch and delicious! Best meal we had in Singapore in our four day stay
4
What I like about this restaurant is the service rendered by the more than capable team members. From the beginning of our meal...when we requested for a particular table and were obliged by the manager...to the service accorded by Margarita (sorry if I got it wrong, but I think that is how her name is spelt), personalized service was their top priority.The buffet spread wasn't that bad too. It was international, with the usual items, i.e. seafood pasta, laksa, briyani, sushi, etc. What I loved was the selection of fruits available at the entrance of the restaurant. You get to choose the fruits and the team member behind the counter will cut them up for you. Great idea! By the entrance of the restaurant is also where you find the gelato counter. If coming to Sentosa is your idea of getting away from the mainland, it will do you good to spend the time here at this restaurant enjoying the sumptuousness of its buffet spread and more importantly, the service by its dedicated team members
4
Depending on your experience with buffet dinners, the price of around $65 after taxes were a bit steep. Though oysters were available, once could not just feast on it alone for dinner. But overall experience was good, with staff being very helpful and courteous and the spread was reasonable
5
I chanced upon this restaurant while trying to find a place to eat for the Chinese New Year reunion meal. We liked the lunch spread (on a Friday) so much that we went back with our relatives a week later to try their Sunday high tea buffet (from 12-5 pm). Again, we were not disappointed.For the price (about S$36 for lunch and S$33 for Sunday High Tea), the spread was generous. Note that high tea is an Asian spread, and lunch though international has more Asian/Singaporean type food.There were 13 of us and none of us had any complaints about any of the dishes that we ate. They were all above average or good (by Singaporean standards). We agreed that their mutton curry is one of the best that we had tasted in Singapore (and we're all locals so...). Their prata with egg goes very well with the mutton and chicken curry. They do not break the yolk but cook it below the prata ( so it's like a sunny side up sitting on a prata when they flip it over). This was so good I had 3 servings each time I went!Other dishes worth trying during the Sunday high tea were their otak, bak ku teh, laksa and chicken rice.Besides the food, service was top notch. My cousin spilled her soba sauce over her iphone and the manager and staff immediately dashed over with napkins to clean up the mess, all the while smiling and asking if she was alright. My aunt asked for a prata and forgot to collect it. The waitress promptly brought it over when it was done.Ambience is very pleasant and it's facing the Hard Rock Hotel pool so you can enjoy the pool view while eating.Given its location and the fact that an ala carte meal in some of the restaurants on the island can cost twice as much, the Starz is great value for money, especially if you are looking for local food and coming in a group, or with kids.I'll definitely go back and dine again. They also have promotions with the Genting casino card. During our first meal, it was 2 for the price of 1 and for the second, it was 3 for the price of 1. For overseas visitors who do not have to pay the $100 levy, it may be well worth your while to just visit the casino and sign up for a membership card so that you can use that to further offset the cost of a great meal !

We ate one buffet dinner n two buffet breakfasts here during our stay. The quality of food is on the average n the selection is just appropriate. It could be extended more as a resort hotel. The service is good as the waitresses keep coming back n remove ur dishes. My experience with them is averaged

Our family dined here for the buffet dinner. It was quite a good deal as with every 2 paying adults, up to 2 children get to eat for free. So we opted for it.The restaurant is quite cozy, with enough space between tables to move about freely (important to hunt down the food in the buffet table :))selection wise was the usual, a little bit of Singaporeans, Indians, Europeans, Japanese. they do serve fresh oysters, prawns, sashimi, wahgyu beef burgers. the quality of the food was nothing to shout about. They were all above average. For the promotion that they were running, it was worth while. But if you have to pay full price for it, then i would advice to skip.Overall, dine only if you don't feel like searching for food if u stay in Hard Rock Hotel. However, without the promotion, you can have better quality food out there in Resort World

There is buy 1 get 1 free pastries or cakes after 8pm. I bought a carrot cake (3 layers) S$6.20 and get a cheese cake free. Value for money! Not application for drinks. Subject to GST. But still worth it!

The nasi lemak chilli is nice . The half boiled egg is nice too (they call it 63 degree poach eggs) . The spread is the same for the 2 days we went but we are ok .

I had been to this restaurant for twice. Last was few years ago with friends during some buffet promotion and the 2nd time was consider on business treat. I wasn't impress on my 1st experience, not much memories on that but 2nd time lately I found the menu improved (I would think so since a long time never visit), although both also dinner buffet. There are selection of salad and cheese, hot and cold food, sushi and sashimi with oyster, indian and chinese Cuisines, then end with fruits, desserts combination of cakes, pastries and ice cream. Overall I was satisfied with the buffet spread and their desserts consider quite nice as there are a few I tasted good

Terrible bland food, rubber bacon, battery acid tea & coffee & no service at all by wait staff. Tables are crowded in and you have to squeeze between them. No one has a brain...why not just remove one table here and there to make the area much safer. Also...you serve runny, room temperature jam with a spoon not a knife. We have travelled all over the world and had many dining experiences. This would have to rate as one of the worst

The buffet spread was good. The Indian dishes and stewed prawns were our favourites. Only the sushi looks ordinary. Food was replenished relatively quickly. Service staff was attentive.We were allowed to split the bill so as to enjoy the child-dine-free offer and also use our dining vouchers for other adults.The 6 of us were given a bench seat with a high back rest. However, we had to sit at the edge of the bench to reach the table as it was fixed at quite a distance away. We were given extra cushions to support our back

My boyfriend and I had dinner buffet on a Sunday. The spread was quite decent with pasta, sashimi, prawn, oysters, indian food, chinese food and desserts. Service crew were attentive. They refilled our water and cleared our plates promptly. We were quite satisfied with our meal. Upon reservation, they asked if it was for a special occasion and I told them it was my boyfriend's birthday. The staff was very nice and informed that for birthday celebration, there will be a complimentary dessert. However, only when we were leaving the restaurant did they remember the dessert. However, we were too full and told them it's alright. Other than that, dinner was great and the food was nice

I visited the restaurant on 8 Aug 13. There was a high tea buffet promotion at $28++ per adult.Free up to 4 kids below 12 for 2 full paying adults.I paid a total of about S$65nett for my family of 2 adults+4kids.it is very value for money. If I were to go to other hotels, I need to pay for my kids who usually don't eat much and not worth the money. My kids ate fried spring rolls, roti prata, sushi, soba, popcorn chicken, icecream, cakes etc. The variety is just enough for my small appetite kids.The high tea buffet has pandan chicken, otah, satay, fried spring roll, roti prata, mutton curry, chicken curry, brani, laksa, porridge, soba, fried gyoza, fried pumpkin, sushi (a few types that suits kids), salad bar, desserts, ice cream.Service is very good. but Air-con is freezing cold. Maybe that is to make diners (especially those with kids) not to stay for too long :).Will visit again during promotion

We booked the banquet for friday 9th and original price $55 per head for adults but staff rang to advise as public holiday up to $75, with children free. We had to proceed as wanted an early night before returning to australia the next morning. Unfortunately when paying was told the plus plus had to be added SO A VERY EXPENSIVE DINNER. Beautiful food and great service but would probably not spend this sort of money again. Ourbirthday boys enjoyed the evening and the festive organized cakes which was appreciate

Fortunately, it's 2 paying adults (S$28+++ each) and 1 kid eat free during the promotion month. But with 2 adults and 2 kids, paying S$14+++ for one more kid seems to be too expensive when he ended up munching just fried wanton (dumplings), 2 sticks of satay, crackers and ice cream.It's a nice spread with salads (kids don't like it), spicy mee goreng, spicy fried rice, rendang, chicken curry, dill curry, nasi briyani, roti prata (kids can't eat them), Taiwan porridge and tim sum (kids are bored with that), usual Japanese rolls, reasonable spread of (kids not impressed) kueh kueh and cakes.I must say its a good place for the adults to wind down and enjoy delicious tasty meal while chatting away but definitely not a place for the kids despite fantastic service. But topping up for food is slow.Hope they could cater some non spicy food for family rather. I guess they should stay on with the promotion or even offer one paying adult for 1 kid instead. I will definitely go there again. But without my kids... I guess not
