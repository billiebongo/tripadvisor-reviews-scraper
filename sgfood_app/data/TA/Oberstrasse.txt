I had lunch here. The Egg Royale is nice. The overall environment is good except the restaurant exhaust system. Your cloth might be smelly after the visit.

We had eggs, bacon, toast and coffee. Here you will find all you need for a perfect start into the day ;-)

A great breakfast spot, serves the most amazing fresh, warm muffins, and good bacon and eggs. Only had breakfast here, wish my stay in Singapore was long so that I could have tried dinner here!

A nice little relaxing place with good food and also friendly service. Prices are reasonable for the portion served and there is no gst and service charge.

Found by accident when returning to our hotel (V Hotel Lavender), and decided to try breakfast the following day.Wow, the Eggs Benedict were done to perfection, and the freshly made waffle was a dream.The only problem was what to choose, If in The Lavender area head to the Kitchner Centre and give this place a try, you will not be disapointed .

We first noticed this cafe while we were walking from the Lavender metro station to our hotel, Hotel Yan (a short stroll away). It looked like our kind of place -- industrial decor, great smell of coffee -- so we decided to try out their breakfast. My cappuccino was great and we both enjoyed our breakfast of Eggs Benedict and waffles. Needless to say, we especially went back again for those waffles (which can easily be shared by 2). This is a lovely cafe which also offers dessert and lunch selections. We thought it was very good quality for the price and the service was efficient. If we're back in Singapore some time again, we will surely pay them another visit

I have been here twice, once for brunch and another for breakfast. Even on a Saturday, the cafe isn't that crowded, probably due to the location. One of the best rosti I've ever had, though it's naturally very oily, so I had the eggs benedict the next time and it was heavenly. The portions are huge and worth the price. Not quite sure about the dessert. All in all, I would definitely choose this place to sit down on a weekday morning with my laptop

When i went to singapore with My Mom, we stayed at V-Hotel Lavender and this cafe near from the hotel, at the firs time when we looked at the fron of cafe, i saw sticker of trip advisor and then i was curious to try the foods and beverages, i ordered a cup of coffee and a slice of red velvet, and My Mom ordered tea and a slice of chese cake. i thought the coffee was good and the cakes were delish, This cafe is recommended because their foods & beverages are so good with affordable price, and the staffs are friendly

Went here for a brunch because I stayed in a hostel nearby. Ordered their egg benedict with bacon (can't remember what they called it in the menu) with a hot latte and all are nice. I would say the price is considered inexpensive for Singapore so really really worth the try.

I love Oberstrasse. Egg benedicts are very tasty. True Swiss roesti (hashbrown) with veal sausage is probably the best you can find in Singapore! Staff is always friendly and one can feel the owner studied some time in Switzerland to know what food is like there. Prices are very moderate as well. I acn only highly recommend this restaurant and hope to see more outlets soon..

Prices are decent. Food was good and served all at the same times. I recommend the rosti there which was very good. But it is very heavy. Do share with a friend if you plan to order a dessert!

The best coffe shop in singapore, very cheap and its amazing food.
Everything is good and the place is very nice. My favorite hangover food and pasta in singapore
5
Came here three times in total. The food is very authenthic European, I think this place is being run by a Europe lover.
Coffees were fabuluous, same as hosts and food. Free Wifi available. Highly recommend.
5
Many different options on breakfast and juices. Food was very good and the staff was super friendly. I would repeat!

Ordered the chicken teriyaki sandwich and a flat white. Both were excellent. The ambience was relaxed

Oberstrasse makes affordable and tasty Rosti's if you are a Rosti-lover, and that is what my wife and I are. The serving is huge, with the fabulously fried Rosti covering almost the entire plate, a generous serving of sourcream and chives on the side and one good long thick Wurst because we had the Bratwurst version. There are other flavors you might want to try too, or the other lineup of all-day breakfasts and mains to choose from

This amazing little restaurant serves amazing bacon and egg breakfasts. Amazing that you could even think of such a traditionally English start for the day when surrounded by so many great Asian alternatives but we did and on a regular basis. The service is excellent, the coffee great, with fast effective WiFi it is a treat not to be missed

This cafe looked nice from the outside but unfortunately the quality of the ingredients used was lacking and the service also poor. We asked for poached eggs to be cooked medium well and the waiter told us the kitchen was very busy and he was unable to assist with our request

It is a good place to have friends gathered for brunch seasion. They have a "All Day Breakfast" menus, a menus for waffles, pasta menus, Main menus and not to forget coffee menus. Alot of foreign, Ang Mo likes to come visit the cafe. Below is the Egg Benedict picture. A sure must try place in the east.

Had breakfast here 5/6 days I stayed in Singapore and had 3 items from the Menu. Only reason I didn't eat there on the one day is because me and the girlfriend had booked one night in the Marina Sands Bay Hotel. The food was great value for money compared to the majority of what we saw in Singapore and the portion sizes were plentiful.- Buttermilk Waffle w/bacon and maple was cooked to perfection. Lots of maple syrup (given in a mini jug). I love maple syrup.- Big Breakfast was very nice. Not a huge fan of the Frankfurter sausages (i'm a Cumberland man) but they were good.- Egg & Bacon on toast. Opted for egg Sunnyside Up and got exactly that, no breakages (same for the Big Breakfast). 2 slices of toast, topped with crispy bacon.If I ever come back to Singapore, I'll definitely revisit here. The staff are also very friendly and provide you with water when seated
