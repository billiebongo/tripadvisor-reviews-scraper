The food was very good in a bright clean environment. The staff was very helpful. We recommend. It is an independent restaurant in the hotel.

We are staying at the hotel and we visited the restaurant to have lunch.
Our pizza was very tasty and fresh.
The staff has been very polite. They even know what coffee we order!!
Good job Four Points by Sheraton!

Review by Dr Sim. This the number 1 Chinese Herbal Restaurant, in my view. Food is excellent. Ambience is good. Service is average. Good for tourist to try. Try the Buddha Jumps Over the Wall Soup. Suckling Pig. Expensive but good food. Regards Dr Sim.

This is the first time I tried imperial herbal. The services is good. Interesting dessert which is a must try. It came with pumpkin and yam pieces in mai ya tang where you will dip into ice water. It is delicious.
3
We are staying at the hotel and decided not to go out & eat here. The service was only mediocre and the food was quite good, what we ordered at least.
4
We celebrated Mother's Day here. Food was tasty and presentable. Not too crowded and not so expensive at hotel standard. A choice for special family dinner.
4
Still recovering from our long flight, we decided to eat in. The restaurant has an extensive menu. My wife chose the fragrant beef, and I had the crispy duck. Both dishes were done very well. Note that it is possible to order smaller portions of several dishes. This is a plus. The staff was frriendly, but the service was VERY slow and inattentive. Our dishes did not come out together, My wife was finished eating by the time mine came to the table

We're a fan of this restaurant for many years since the good old days at The Metropole which no longer existed. The must haves - egg white nest, the sliced fish with lily bulbs and asparagus and the dessert sweet potatoes with yam in caramel. Restaurant is a big dining hall, no private rooms, was a bit noisy when there were big groups. Overall food is still good but sparing staff to give good service. If we are back again, it's for the good food
3
Had dinner and the fried rice with silver fish was really good. But though this restaurant is in the new Four Points by Sheraton Riverview they don't charge the bills to the rooms. Have to pay separately. When I asked for water they said I have to pay for a glass of water which I didn't agree to. Finally they have me a glass of water.
5
We have been eating at Imperial Herbal for many years during our visits to Singapore, from the time they were at Metropole Hotel to Vivo City. Now they are located at 4 points by Sheraton (formerly Riverview Hotel) on Havelock Road. Had their set menu, and the must have is the egg white nest starter. All the dishes were delicious and the set was good value. Service was excellent overall. Highly recommended
3
Celebrated my mother birthday in this restaurant. Price is average and food is so below average. Wine selection is limited. Restaurant is quite spacious and ideal for family who do not want to spend too much.
5
We frequently eat here when in Singapore.
Usual excellent standard of food.
Excellent service as expected.
Good variety of food and drinks.
Will certainly return again
5
I liked the portions but you do have to bring some friends so you can try more of an assortment of dishes. Also I would not have known that the Durian pudding is to die for, once past he smell its great!

Surprised to receive a $30 voucher from imperial, I decided to bring the family over for a visit to rekindle the old imperial taste. To our disappointment , the food was not as good as before. We ordered the fluffy egg white, cod fish, herbal chicken and sweet potato and tapioca dessert. The egg whites was served cold, the cod fish and herbal chicken didn't taste as good as before and the dessert didn't come out hot. To top it all up, the restaurant had a power trip that lasted close 30 mins.
4
When in Singapore you must have Chilli Crab. As usual everyone says they have the original and best. On our last night in Singapore we decided to have crab. the Imperial offer 2 types. The Chilli and the Black Pepper. Both were delicious. The staff looked after us very well and nothing was problem.If you want a crab without all the hype try the Imperial
3
We were searching for a place for our Chinese New Year gathering and every restaurant in the city was fully booked. We were however able to get a reservation with this restaurant. The food was average and not so much variety. Since it was a sit down dinner, we had to wait for dinner to be served and since the place was full of other Chinese New Year celebrants, service was a bit slow. Food was nothing to rave about
4
I only spent 1 night at this hotel as was doing a quick whistle-stop tour of Singapore. (I was mainly visiting KL) its within walking distance from Chinatown. To get to the hotel from the airport I took the train/underground to Promenade and went to the flyover.and from there bought a hop on and off ticket and toured the city using its three routes. The hotel is by one of the stops on the Brown/Original tour - I think stop 11 or 1
4
13 of us had a sit down Chinese dinner refer to pic for menu. Price SGD800 after 15% VIP discount.Ambience - private room on our own - peaceful n quietFood - 8 out of 8 dishes were very well executed. nothing too bland nor to heavily seasoned.quality of the food is fresh and portion is very generousService - may be 7/10. Plates not changed until requested and hot tea was poured by ourselves 80% of the time but generally acceptable.Price : very reasonable considering the quality, taste and portion. Good for big group dinnerHad a peek on the dim sum menu - not extensive but reasonably priced.Overall a very satisfying meal for the whole family - would definitely come back and do not hesitate to recommend to friend
3
the buffet spread is limited and overall the taste is average compared the price can get a better elsewhere.the replenish of the food is slow and some not replenish after two servings so disappointed.But service is good and staff are friendly and helpful, the ambience is cosy and clean.The standard of food need improve and the sashimi were not fresh.The hotel can consider give complimentary car ticket to diner instead just for the first hour
4
If I could give 3 1/2 stars then that would be about right, i.e. halfway between average and very good.The room was well equipped and clean. The public rooms on the ground floor are rather dated.The location is good by the river, it is a lovely walk to the centre of the city by the riverside. Anywhere else is just a short and cheap taxi ride away
5
I was staying there for 3nights...everything was nice...The buffet luch is awesome. And the front desk staff, Simon Chia was very helpful. Hope to stay there again on my next stop over.
5
An excellent dining experience. Really good food, although not all brought to the table at the same size.
Helpful advice on portion sizes and how many dishes to order for those not familiar.
Best Chinese food had in Singapore so far
4
Very Good hotel, meet you at the door and take your suitcase from you. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Rooms not overly big but clean and tidy. Breakfast was nice, lots of choice.
4
I had booked in advance through Qantas Frequent Flyers as I saw some reviews that were nice to match the price for Singapore. Very friendly and helpful staff who were very accommodating and easy to communicate with. Hotel was very clean and neat.
Thank you.
5
We booked a premier room was disappointed very old & tied .The toilet leaked needed new carpet & paint. Not a bad size room plenty of restaurants across from it.
4
Nice little very affordable treat after 2.30pm only.
The cakes are very nicely presented, appealing to the eye.
Try the fruit custard tart, delicious
5
Good food with good service and the opportunity to sit outside and watch the world go by. Also there is an extensive buffet option should you prefer.
5
This restaurant specialises in cuisine based upon Chinese herbal medicine. With 3 days notice you can get on onsite Dr's assessment and a menu to match. All dishes are good, some exotic, they are unusual and have medicinal variations on ones of the same name elsewhere. I try to visit each time I am in Singapore
4
My colleagues and I had lunch at the Imperial Herbal Restaurant recently. There was no minimum spend required for a private room and the room was large enough to accommodate 13 of us. What this restaurant lacks in ambience, it surely makes up for it in terms of the food they serve and the excellent service provided by Ms Dan during our visit. This restaurant specialises in the use of Chinese herbs and tonics to produce healthy yet tasty food. There is an impressive variety of double boiled soups but my personal favourite is the "Fu Rong" (Fluffy Egg White) w/ Dried Scallop appetiser. I always order this when I am here. Prices are very reasonable and certainly value for money. I would return to the restaurant again
3
The food is not as good as it used to be when it first started in the then Metropole Hotel in Seah Street. It was more flavoursome then, and had more variety and innovative items on the menu. Nowadays, the food is not "exotically herbal" anymore. I feel that they've lost their unique competitive advantage as a "herbal" specialty restaurant. They should offer unique herbal dim sum made by their chefs instead of just the ordinary Dim Sum which does not even look appetising to try. The Superior Shark's Fin Soup w/ Sea Cucumber, Fish Maw & Abalone was value for money at $28 per bowl as they were generous with their portions
5
We had chicken curry which was hot with spice but very nice we also were sat over looking the river which was nice just watching the world go by the staff are very helpful
4
Been here for second time and satisfied my taste buds tremendously.
The unique Buddha-hand chairs is something of eye pleaser.
Some of the staff may need better training but most were accommodating and helpful.
4
although the food was well presented my father cannot eat the food although our breakfast was very nice albeit it was only tea and toast it was still very nice and presented by very nice staff.
4
They have moved to smaller premises on the second floor of Riverview Hotel at Havelock Road, but the quality and standards of the food is still very good. We had the tonic soups, fluffy egg white in fried potato basket (a personal fave), deep fried egg plant, prawns with walnut and pumpkin sauce (another great dish) and yam and sweet potato with treacle dessert. All dishes were great, except for one - fish slice in brown sauce, which was a little bland. Service was good as usual. A meal for 7 of us came to around S$280, which is reasonable. Do also try the lychee black tea.Do note that the carpark is located in the basement and you will need to climb some flights of steps to reach the hotel lobby, where you then catch the lift to the second floor
3
Went here with my colleagues. Although the food is not my kind of dish, but the atmosphere and restaurant's interior fed my interest to experience sitting and eating the food from the menu.Was the three of us. My colleagues ordered a bowl of soup and 3 other main course dishes from the menu to share (can't remember what they were).Well, if you're a fan of herbal food, then this is the place for you. But if you're more like me... maybe some other Chinese restaurants (non herbal based dish) would be more of your preference.
3
This restaurant started at the then Metropole Hotel in Seah Street and had moved to Vivo City and recently to River View Hotel where it is operating. At Seah street and Vivocity, they had a counter for a Physician to give you a health check before "prescribing" the curative dishes with the accompanying herbs that could cool you down or warm you up or nourish you if your body is neutral?? Great novelty but not practical as diners seldom come alone but in groups.The dishes in Havelock Road premises appeared to be less delicious or savory. Either they have realigned the cooking process or change of chefs and kitchen crew or cook in newer methods that enhance the efficacy of the herbs.Service staff is polite and responsive for a fine dining restaurant but apparently not attentive and understaff .Complimentary parking can only be given after the subsequent patronage which is weird but must have their reasons.Ambience is nice and pleasant at the River view Hotel
4
I am a fan of this restaurant buffet. I have celebrated many special occasions in here. When it comes to festive seasons e.g. National day, Christmas etc where all the hotel buffets are fully booked, this is one that still have available seats because not much Singaporeans know about this place is a good choice actually. The food are value for money. After eating , you may like to have a stroll at the nice walkway towards Robertson Quay
2
I booked this Hotel coz yes the location is great, but aside from that it has nothing more to offer. Rooms are smelly. When i checked in, a caucasian guy was asking a reception officer where is the best place to eat for that night, the staff cannot give an answer, (i think the staff does not understand the question coz she only speaks chinese)
4
We had a meal in the restaurant . I had bugger and chips and my partner had buffet. Good food. We also had a fab night watching Liverpool beat Manchester one night in outside bar area. The place was full of Liverpool supporters and atmosphere was fantastic. Never had so much fun watching a football match.
5
We were not residents but found it one evening and had a meal and a few drinks here. Then setting is a bit basic but the food and service were excellent and the prices reasonable. On the evening we were in there was a 3 piece female singing group and they were very good, easy listening
1
nothing is good about the hotel, rooms, cleanliness, carpets, furniture bathrooms and staff all is zero. discourteous staff by any standards. not even a2 star std
4
When 'walk in' an hour before our planned dining time to make reservation for a table of 10, the manager I think, was saying how their restaurant are fully booked and I did not make reservation day earlier. After mumbling for 5 minutes, he said he still have one table for me. Hmm...suggest that you should make reservation day in advance even though you know the restaurant space is big and definitely has table.Went there to celebrated my mum's birthday and was impressed with the excellent services from the serving staff. They are attentive and plates are removed and replaced new quite frequently. As we ordered mainly from the ala carte menu that is more affordable range, we are able to order many dishes to taste. No complains on the food. When cake cutting time, staff even played birthday song and offered to cut the cake and serve us. Overall, service and food is worth for return visit Total bills is about $270
3
Maybe we were tired, but we couldn't find anything inspiring on either the a la carte menu or the smorgasbord in the cafe. We settled for fish and chips. I hadn't experienced "soft" fish before and was nervous that it wasn't cooked properly. I wouldn't recommend the food, but loved the hote
4
The restaurant is strong in introducing Chinese herbs into the dishes. Enjoy the soups in the restaurant. Loved the duck cooked with Hawthorne and pear. The duck meat can literally be torn from the bones. One of the favourites is the egg white with scallop. Realized there is a menu which is for smaller eating group. Good to have it as sometimes we have few people. Prices also lower for the smaller dishes menu. Enjoyed the desserts as they are refreshing in taste and beneficial to health
4
There are two separate menus, one with comparatively lower prices ala cafe style and another more pricey n extensive. We ordered mainly from the cafe menu and though prices ranges from 5.80 to 7.80, (exclusive of taxes n svc charges ), it was still delicious and of good quality. We ordered one dish from the pricier menu as my son wanted to have spring rolls (strange why they dun offer in the cafe menu). That cost 12.00 which is the most ex of all the 5 dishes we had. I was a tad regretting having ordered it but when it arrived n we tasted it, it was so good and fresh. There are 6 pcs, so each pcs is 2 bucks, pretty ex huh. But its worth trying. I did not know that there is supposed to be a tcm doc on standby to prescribed food for you as i did nit see any but hey, why would i want someone to order my food? Im old enough to select a good balance n selection of food for myself n family. I ain't going eat croc soup just because someone say so, or would you?! Overall, i would visit this place again cis the food taste good and it has a nice view
3
Stick to the basics when ordering - go for the soups, some of which are gender specific, and which aim to nourish the body. Other nice dishes are the broiled and fluffed eggwhite on a crispy bed, seared scallops with noodles, pork ribs, and crispy duck. To end the meal, try the sweet potato and yam dessert, with sugar, which you dip into a bowl of iced water before eating. Do ask for a table facing Sentosa and the harbor

I was on a staycation with my partner, and the reason I chose this hotel over the others was the price - lowest among the 'prettiest' (as were the photos on the net). Thought I got myself a good deal, but it was a disappointment right from the time we settled down. Guests have to pay for ANY movie channels at 18 SGD per show. All the other free channels were news, from those of Asia's, to the ones from Italy. We had to bear with NO decent telly unless Channel 5 decided to give us a good watch. The hotel provided us with a tv guide, but they might as well make do without it. Bored, I headed to the restroom to look around AAAAND voila! There was NO toothbrush, no comb. The simplest items ALL hotels should provide. Even Hotel 81 has all these necessities! So the day goes on right, and we just got back from buying our dinner when TADAAA! We realize there were no chopsticks or any form of cutlery. There were only teaspoons for your hot drink. Thank God they had an ice tray and free hot drinks.Oh wait I forgot the lobby area! There aren't any plush seats, so tourists were standing anywhere and everywhere with no magazines or newspapers to flip through while waiting for their transport. It's a pain for the eye, and I was embarrased as a Singaporean to have seen that. Now as you can see, as a Singaporean staying in a hotel in Singapore itself, I do have high expectations out of the hotels here. So thank goodness Great World City shopping mall is only 10 minutes away, what with the nasi padang stall opp it serving awesome Malay food & all. There's a hawker centre beside the stretch where the nasi padang stall is located, but for those seeking halal meals, don't bother. All halal food stalls have vanished. For those party-goers, Zouk is just round the corner, behind Grand Copthorne hotel. If you're just looking for a bar/pub to chill, just cross the bridge behind the hotel and there you have, a whole stretch of 'em. When booking your room, request for the one which has a window overlooking the Singapore River. The bridge there lights up after 7! Really nice view. Anyway, going around town is made easy with the nearest bustop being just outside the hotel. Buses to all parts of Singapore. Still.... I will never again stay here after all these nitty gritty stuff being absent for guests use -.- Thus, there was no value for money. I mean, even the front desk staff weren't so welcoming. Oh well...
2
This place needs some maintenance... Maybe it lives up to China standard but doesn't to International standard. Rooms are run down, buffet restaurant very disappointing and service isn't special at all - actually I found the reception staff a little arrogant.I will for sure never book here again..
4
I often eat in this hotel when I visit Singapore.Personally I don't like buffets, and this buffet is no exception in that quality is so so. However the a la carte menu is really good, they have a limited range of dishes but everything I have tried was really good. Especially the Singapore fried rice (not on the menu at the moment) and the lobster laksha is good. Price is reasonable
4
Had dinner there twice last week - looking for a break form Asian food every lunch & dinner. Fish & chips not great - is it ever in Singapore? - but the burger was OK. Best thing was the location - right by the river, but not a noisy pub - a chance to relax and soak in the city! Service good but not overwhelming. I'll go again next time I'm back - maybe for the weekend brunch
3
Went only for an evening meal since a colleague was staying there. The food was just about acceptable at the coffee shop.
4
As per my view for this hotel..i'ts good and have a quality.
Clean, spacious and good.
5
We didn't stay here but came for breakfast and to watch the Rugby. Great value breaky and great location. Good beer. Thanks.
4
value for money, big portions, very good service, excellent canal views
3
This is a poor cousin of the original one at Liang Seah Street.

PROS:
Every table has a nice sea view.
CONS:
Expensive.
3
Found the hotel quite good, location not central but within distance for all sightseeing, upon arrival was asked to leave either credit card or Â£100 behind as security, we were then locked out of our room after this ran out after useing bar and restaurant, reception manager left his reception staff to deal with me without making eye contact to me, all other staff were very good and restaurants were good
3
Just returned from our honeymoon whereby we booked the River View Hotel as a stop-over hotel for 2 nights prior to heading off to Thailand.The hotel location was ideal as it is on the river (good navigation point), close to Chinatown, the MRT and some recommended bars/restaurants around Robertson Quay.Arrived at the hotel after an early morning flight from London and was pleased to be told, by an exceptionally friendly member of staff, that the room would be ready for us at 10am. Gave us time to have a coffee in the restaurant and a wander around.The staff were perfectly nice and friendly throughout the stay.The wi-fi charges are a little steep, but unfortunately is what i've come to expect City based hotels in this day and age.The room itself had a good view of the river and the City, no problems at all with cleanliness and ammenities within the room.For the price paid to stay, it is a perfectly good short stay hotel. Can't comment on the food and drink at the hotel but if i had to do a stopover and fancied close access to the river and Chinatown then i'd recommend a stay
2
I booked this hotel for 4 nights and conveyed the hotel that we come at so and so time and since come with a toddler we need early check in. And when we get into the hotel they acted as if no communication was done and they had no empathy over my sleeping child after the jet lag. And even when the rooms were available they didn't come to us until we go and ask again and again for a room which we already paid in advance. The food was average and no variety.. Don't know how they became 3 or 4 star.. I would say a 1 star hotel or below. Didn't see a single person in the hotel staff who is trained on customer support or empathy on even a basic level. Rooms were small and not happy about the room service too. Not recommending to anyone
3
Buffet food is limited, not that a lot of choices, unless you are a desserts fan, then the range of desserts they have won't fail to appease you. Their Soup of the Day is really good though. The salmon did not look that fresh though.  They also served BBQ food. However, only limited range.  Wished that they served more variety of food
3
Nice quiet ambience but the food is average in taste, nothing too exciting
4
Nice place for a beer and some food with seating right beside the river. Live music in the evenings which is also good.
3
I have been staying in this hotel few times during business trip. The hotel is old and room is small. Not a good experience
1
HI All, i hosted my friends from overseas to the restaurant. food overall was ok. i ordered crabs and there were LOTS of sand on the smaller legs. This is totally unacceptable. i dont know how much sand we have consumed.
3
good dim sum but service rather slow...many staff but seemed too bisy with customers
3
Very medicinal soups - and surprisingly good tasting
4
Though we were not guests at the hotel,we did have the Friday night buffet.Great location on the riverfront at night,so pretty and cool if you choose to sit outside,as we did.Live entertainment.Happy hour pints $S8 till 8,dinner starts at 6.30 so you dont blow the budget.HUGE selection of food,including a variety of seafoods,all delicious,and a desert section to satisfy the biggest sweet tooth.Worth every $ of the S38pax

Until I read the rest of the reviews I had no idea there was supposed to be a doctor at this place who looks at you and prescribes the kind of food you should eat! Anyway, we decided to order the 5 dish 2 person "healthy meal" which was steamed pomfret in a light gravy, duck in a richer sauce, rice, spinach with century egg, and some kind of black-colored jello with honey. I had some Chinese wine (they only have one kind) and my partner had a Tiger beer. The food was pretty good. It was certainly authentic Chinese - none of this "modified for tourist palate" type food at this place. It is made for Asian palates and the flavors are unusual and flavorful. Certainly an experience if you're used to westernized Asian meals!The restaurant itself isn't that comfortable. It's dark and there are square wooden stools rather than chairs but that isn't such a big deal. We paid $40 for the 5-dish meal, 2 cups of wine (it's little thimbles, not wine glasses) and a beer which is reasonable. We did ask for the peanuts and napkins to be removed from the bill since we didn't use them. They weren't removed so we just didn't pay the extra charges. It's a shame when a restaurant tries to charge you for using the napkins. That's why restaurants charge higher prices than takeouts because you create laundry for them by eating there. Charging a customer 30 cents for using their napkin is just petty. They tried to bring us the bill in the middle of eating as well saying they were closing the cash register. We asked them to bring it back at the end of the meal in case we ordered more food or drinks which they did. Plus we don't want to be fiddling about with purses and credit cards in the middle of our main course. Close the cash register at the end of the evening!This place is worth a visit if you want to sample authentic Chinese food in an authentic Chinese atmosphere. There are thousands of Chinese restaurants in Singapore but if you're in the VivoCity mall you could do a lot worse than this one

Heard about this place from the travel channel and thought it would be interesting, but the restaurant is not at all what it proclaims itself to be. Supposedly there's a doctor in-house that "prescribes" a different set of food dishes for each individual after giving them an exam. There not only wasn't a doctor there, we were told by staff that the doctor is supposed to come in once a week for about an hour during one morning, that it was by appointment only, but that the doctor hadn't been seen at all for many months and they weren't sure how to schedule. We had actually called ahead and weren't told any of this over the phone.We decided to try the place anyway since we made the trip over. That was not a good idea. We were seated in a section that seemed like a dilapidated child's playroom, complete with bright pastel chairs and mickey mouse cushions. There were 3 menus that were too large and confusing. We ordered a mix of dishes including fish and vegetables. There was an extra charge for things like bread, rice or tea. Even before the end of the meal I found myself running out to the mall in search of the bathroom (the restaurant doesn't have its own facilities). By the end of the evening, everyone in our party found themselves in the same situation. On top of that, we found some charges on our bill for things that we didn't order. Without even glancing at the bill, the waitress said she would remove the charges immediately, leading us to believe that she had placed the unauthorised charges there on purpose.Just avoid this place

Twenty years ago Mrs. Wang-Lee Tee Eng opened her herbal restaurant. From a journey to Northern China she had brought along two gourmet cooks and an herbalist doctor. She was convinced of the concept to connect a healthy kitchen with the Haute Cuisine and to serve it attractively. Its first location right next to the famous Raffles Hotel the restaurant soon reached world fame. Without advance reservation one could hardly get a table. Meanwhile Mrs Wang found a new location: On the top floor of Vivo City overlooking part of Singapore harbour. The ambiance is simple and tasteful, not the usual red/golden heavy design of the typical Chinese restaurant. You have the choice to either order from the menu or to consult the doctor of the restaurant first what might be good for you if for instance you have high blood pressure. The doctor will take your pulse, look into your eyes and study your tongue. He takes a few notes on a pad and passes it on the waitress. The dishes will be discussed with you and you might end up with an abundant meal, which will be tasetfully prepared, deliciously served and on top of it all it will be good for your health.The Imperial Herbal Restaurant is situated on the third floor at Singaporeâ€™s VivoCity. There are no other branches of this restaurant. Whatever similar locales you may find, they just try to copy the original
