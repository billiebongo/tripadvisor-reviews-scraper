The food is vefy good taste and the environment is quite good also. The service is very good (they helped us to separate the Tom yum soup into small portions.
5
The food and the ambience was awesome. Food was tasty. The standard of the thai milk tea dipped in my opinion.
4
from the first step into the restaurant, i was very well treated with the utmost respect from all levels.

Read some positive reviews about this place and decided to give it a go. The view is great. Recommend the salted fish kalian, red tom yam soup. Abit on the pricey side but you get what you pay for. Worth going there for a treat.

OMG. The flavours of our dishes was memorable. The Tom Yam Soup and Chicken Green Curry were STAND-OUTS!! Great vibe, Great location, friendly service.

Now I’m obviously not expert on thai food, but on our visit food was tasty and there was enough on the menu to choose from. The restaurant has nice view to the river. The gentleman who took our orders was very helpful and friendly and the restaurant staff noticed the quest by welcoming hi’s and when leaving thanks and bibi’sNoise level in the restaurant is noticeable, but only 1/3 of the huge noise inside of the mall.Price level what you’d expect from a restaurant in a mall

I have had Thai cuisines extensively but this place was a totally wonderful discovery... The food here was great and every dish was cooked to perfection...The star was the Steamboat Fish... It was juicy and full of flavors...Although the service was a bit slow as it was Sunday and had a long waiting time, Its a must visit for Fish lovers..

We were so happy to find a restaurant with a specials vegetarian menu displayed outside the restaurant just when we were all starving! Thai accent was great food. Had their raw papaya and raw mango salad, both were good. their olive fried rice were the best and not to be missed. The Thai curry, spring rolls, noodles and tofu curry were great too. All in all a great meal with great views too
3
I organised a gathering for 7 people. Nice welcome and we were shown to our table straightaway. Good first impression. The food is not the best Thai I have had but overall OK. We shared our food but the plates were too small and waiter neglected to changed them to larger/more suitable plates. Strange. Overall an OK experience but a but pricey. Food needs some attention to authenticity.

a very established Thai restaurant at VivoCity. we have been there many times. try the Chicken & Basil, Tom Yam Soup, Papaya Salad. Cannot go wrong. Good Value for a full service restaurant. They have a nice outdoor seating area as well while overlooking the sea and Sentosa
3
Thai fish cakes as appetizer and veggies in oyster sauce with tofu as main. The fish cakes were good but the main course was a bit tasteless. Nice view if you sit by the window.
4
Located in Vivo City harbour front, seating available both inside and outside - service is quick, food good and not too expensive
The Sticky rice is to die for!
5
Came here for a casual dinner and ordered the clear based chicken tom yum soup and pad Thai. The clear based soup has the perfect balance of spicy and sour! It stimulates the taste buds and opened up our palates. The chicken in the soup was special too. We don't know how they did it, but it was so juicy and springy! Would definitely visit again for the awesome and value for money food! Restaurant accepts Amex!

We had a good Thai dinner at Thai Accent at Vivocity on a June weekend. The restaurant was crowded (Father's Day weekend) at 7pm and we had to wait 10-15 mins for our table for 2, which was cramped. The waiter was friendly and helpful, although he forgot one sidh we ordered (chicken satay) which we skipped as we were full after the meal. We ordered the Tom Ga Kai in coconut husk (it was not too creamy, and pieced of coconut meat in the sour assam curry), kai-lan vege stir fried with roast pork (a but too salty, roast pork was too dry), roast chicken in pandan leaves (OK, a but dry), and for dessert, the steamed tapioca in coconut milk (the best dish of the day). Waitstaff were friendly and helpful (when you can get their attention), but kept very busy by the sheer number of customers. Prices were a bit higher than average for hte quality of food (which was average)
4
You would have missed it a million times walking them by at Vivocity. With a plethora of dining choices, Thai food is not always on the mind of locals compared to Chinese or Japanese. Yet, the service staff led by Kenny was impressive. With almost a full house, we ordered the appetisers and Olive Fried Rice and Phad Thai. Kenny could speak a little Thai which we tested! The Olive Fried Rice was good but a little too much black sweet sauce. They should have put sugar in place of the sweet sauce which most Thais would prefer. Phad Thai flavour is nice and moist but portion is tad little. Overall, a great meal, good smiley and friendly service. Would definitely return for the Phad See Ew which is not on the menu

I knew this restaurant quite long time ago and for some good period it was my favourite Thai restaurant. The environment is great -- you can see Sentosa from the big window; the waitresses/waiters are good -- very helpful and won't leave the customers sitting at the corner unattended. However the food quality is really going downhill in the past 2 or 3 years. It starts with no more free-float rice, which is a small thing. and 1 year ago, I had the Tom Yam soup (which is supposed to be the most familiar Thai dish around the world I think) and it was really bad... really salty and can't even compare with the normal hawker centre Thai food. And recently we went again and order the claypot glass noodle -- I have had this dish so many times but it is significantly smaller portion now! It might only be 2/3 of the old size or even less... If the restaurant is looking at the review here, I just would like to say: please fix the problem! I am not sure whether it is because of the chef, or the management, or whatever, but as a mid-range restaurant, it really can do better on maintaining the food quality on the a high level -- been there seen it. Just want the old restaurant back..

Dined on a Sunday evening at around 6pm. There wasn't a line to get seated so we were seated immediately.Ordered the clear Tom Yam soup, Pad Thai, Chicken Satay and Red Thai Curry.The soup could be ordered either as a clear soup or with a red base. When asked what the red base was, the waitress replied with 'Milk'. Was rather confused with red milk. Nevertheless, the soup was good albeit a bit too spicy. That's probably personal preference.The Pad Thai was good but the satay and curry were rather disappointing. It probably wasn't a good idea to order satay at such a restaurant after having satay at the hawker centers. It was made using breast meat which made it rather tasteless inside. The marinade was good so this dish could have been great. Likewise, the red curry was served with tasteless chicken breast meat. It was almost as if the chef decided to cook the chicken separately and only added then at the last minute before serving. Again, the curry was good and this dish could have been so much better.Lastly, when we asked about whether the orange juice was freshly made, the waitress replied that it was chilled. Guess freshly squeezed juices were only served warm.The ambience was good though. Quality of food was mixed and service could be clearer
5
After more than 10 visits I had to write a review here. I have to admit that the food quality remains always at a high level. This is great and gives you the confidence every time you go there. I like this location also because of the day Light eating. Prices are reasonable 15-20$ per dish and currys do not come with rice.
5
It was our firat time here and we were totally satisfied with the food. They serve excellent thai food. We ordered tom kha gai which is the creamy chicken coconut soup and stir fried soft shell crab. They also have kids meal to choose from. The ambiance was very nice as well which adds good vibes when you eat
4
I have been to several Thai restaurant in Singapore and this restaurant is one that offer best dining with view. The food and the service is as expected for the price paid. Nice cosy ambience with a private room for bigger group. Will be back again..
5
We came after a big day on sentosa looking for somewhere with good thai and reasonable price. This place didnt disappoint!! The food was amazing, resturant lovely and great service. Green curry to die for!!
4
Tired of the hustle/bustle of Vivo City mall? Try the deck in the back of this Thai restaurant - if you can stand the heat of Singapore. Nice food, and they do serve mango with sticky rice!
3
Service was alright. Food was decent, wasn't great. Wouldn't mind coming back again if other restaurants' queue is too long

We visited this restaurant for Dinner. The Smiling staff ushered us towards our table, set near the large Glass windows overlooking the harbour front.The colourful lights emanating over the buildings ahead of us were from Sentosa Island. The cable cars moving slowly across the breadth of A Dusky Orange Purple hued sky made for a delightful view, ferrying tourists and visitors across from Vivo City to Harbour front.Next, We sited some Delectable Dishes on the Menu Card.Yummm.... the Fragrant food ordered next to our table, churned our Bellies on the Hunger Mode as the waiter served them.We tried the Homemade lemongrass Ice Drink which was very refreshing for this warm tropical weather. Tom Khai Gai Or the creamy chicken with tender Coconut pieces Soup served in its own shell was Relished by all of us with some aromatic Steamed Rice. Prawn cake with plum sauce and salad was very tasty as well. Chicken satay with peanut sauce had the typical Bangkok food flavour... very authentic.You must try the Fresh Green assorted vegetables in mild sauce ~ 'Kangkong' , which was quite appetising.Would love to savour some more Items from their menu, next time 
3
Service was really slow. Not sure why drinks were still not served when those who came much later than us already got theirs. I had to remind them a few times and this auntie waitress (black short hair) whom we requested assistance from twice just told us to hold on a minute and never got back to us. It was pretty annoying because you can't get her to place order nor serve anything.Good thing that we were not rushing for time. Other than service, food was pretty good actually. I would have given a higher rating if not for the less than average service
3
While the staff who greeted me at the entrance was friendly, the female server who took and brought my order to the table did not even greet me or exchanged any pleasantries even though I had initiated with 'thank yous and please'. What is more disappointing is the food. An authentic Thai red curry should be sweet, but the one I had was salty and not aromatic enough. The roti which was served with the dish was not crispy and paled in comparison with the consistent quality ones I had in Bangkok in the Kalpapruek restaurants. The steamed rice was also lacking in the charismatic aroma of Thai Jasmine rice. The Thai iced tea was acceptable but the tea was short of the complexity in its aroma profile that makes a good milk tea. The dessert came with shaved ice that was too chunky and clumped together although the taste was decent. All in all, an average restaurant that does not warrant a second visit.
3
Cosy restaurant in Vivo city. Not crowded during lunch time. Prices a bit expensive. Surprisingly they have more male servers than female. Not enough of personal touch. Staff are not friendly and approachable . Food was served wrongly but staff failed to apologise. Overall rating is only average.
3
Overall, its delicious just a bit expensive. Service is good. SGD122.00 for 2 persons but we ordered 1 starter ( satay, fish cake, fried shrimp, spring roll) , crispy pork with fried kai lan ,2 soups( individual portion) , and one pandan chicken , and 2 drinks. Expensive or not its depend on individual.Opp,price included one mango rice ( take away). Some dishes not bad especially the pandan chicken and the 2 soups. First time i tried the coconut soup, my friend asked me try this soup, she specially ordered for me. Surprisingly good, i like it very much.Althought its not really cheap but will try again because its delicous 
4
Have dined here several times now. Delicious Thai food that might be a tad pricey but is good quality as they do not stint on the ingredients and spices. I don't think I've been disappointed by any dish so far. As a big lover of spicy food I am happy that the spice levels are not overly toned down for the local palate. I've brought many people to this place and all of them have also loved the food
5
I used to be a regular customer to thai accent when I was in singapore.. they are just the best.. they have the yummiest chicken fried rice and I love their starters and tea ! I miss thai accent food a lot now.. Some day I wish to go back and enjoy thai food at thai accent againA must visit restaurant if you like Thai food !
5
A near perfect experience in this restaurant. I recommend it to all who want to enjoy an authentic Thai taste.
2
Ordered the Thai fried rice, seafood Tom yam soup and Thai fish cake. After eating felt really thirsty and the Thai fried rice is kind of soggy. Though the staff do greet you in Thai when you walk into the restaurant.
4
This restaurant is on the 2nd floor of Vivo City. Get an outside table, and just on sunset.
Order your favorite food and drink then enjoy.
We ended spending most evenings at this restaurant and went through the menu. all good food

Overall the food was pretty decent for a mid priced Thai restaurant. Pineapple fried rice was good as was the mango salad and prawn cakes. We had a green curry which unfortunately contained a very long black hair. Sadly not mine or my friends (sadly, because we are folically challenged!) so this belonged to someone else. One mark off for this. The staff didn't deal with it as well as they might. We didn't make a fuss because these things happen but the staff gave the impression this was no big deal. Not sure we even got an apology even though we left most of the dish. So another mark off for the way they dealt (didn't deal) with it. I hope this doesn't put people off going to the restaurant as the food was good. And I'm sure the staff work hard. But some training to help them understand how to deal with things things like would be good. Or to show they care are a little upset that some hair made its way into the food. Also a happier workforce always makes for a more enjoyable restaurant experience but the staff seemed a little joyless. Still, if you are in the area and fancy Thai give it a go and see what you think

We moved to Singapore two months ago from Sydney. Amazingly still searching for a semi decent Thai restaurant next door to Thailand! I think Sydney has spoilt us on contemporary Asian food. The Thai Accent at VivoCity (our nearest Mall) was overall a disappointing experience. The service like most Singapore Mall restaurants is teenagers trying to make a crust, so no understanding of service, timing or how to order. I don't think I go to a restaurant to teach staff how to do their job. She hardly spoke English, got the wine wrong, which arrived late (in fact several teen staff were setting the table while the only two customers in the entire place waited and finally waved at them to get any attention).Regarding the food...the thai fishcakes were off tonight as the microwave was broken (not a good start-microwave). The green chicken curry had the classic flavours but hard work looking for the chicken. A great view but I blame the architects and planners for that.Its a shame when you want a good medium priced Thai meal you need to get a cab to Jim Thompson's Restaurant and pay top dollar.Will keep searching
4
We happened to visit Thai Accent this weekend, on a very random path at 3pm. Normally the restaurants are closed during afternoon but they are still opened so we ordered Tom Yum Bee Fun, Green Curry, Mango Salad and Thai Iced Tea. Really enjoyed the food there especially there is a terrance where we get to see the shore. We added Mango with sticky rice as or dessert and it was very good as expected
5
Been coming here for a while and didn't think it needed improving given the speed of service, quality of food and price but after it's recent makeover I am blown away even further. New crockery, furniture, classy decor, it was great before and suited casual but excellent dining but now it meets all criteria as with the new little booths and lovely decor it can be a special occasion too. The menu is very good, love the mixed platter,the green curry, the pineapple rice and the house wine is really good value for Singapore. Even better, we he 15% off with a Singapore Amex card. Love it
5
Everytime i visit Spore, i never skip this yumm Thai resto. So addictive to their food, ambience, and service. if you wanna to see the harbour you can choose outdoor one. Try their famous steamed fish with signature fresh sauce..sour, sweet, savoury wow really mixed well. And also try pandan chicken, green tom yum curry with coconut milk, minced beef with basil, and iced lemongrass. Don't worry bout the price coz it won't kill your wallet dear

My wife and I decided to walk round Vivo city and came across this place. It was just after lunch time but was still quite busy. The food was excellent and it was difficult to choose. We ordered 3 dishes after the veg spring rolls and prawns in batter. They know how to please here enough chilli to keep you glowing. The chicken was soft and tasty. All in all it was a good meal.We came back a few days later and ate again in the evening. It was even better. The same starter with the dips were lovely. We had pad thai and a fish dish plus two others. Just amassing. The food was hot and tasty and the staff very attentive. I would recommend this to anyone who wants just a bit better than the "touristic street food" that is cropping up everywhere
5
The food here was delicious. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The restaurant was very quiet but it was 4pm. The service was excellent as the table we were sitting at was in the window and it was rather hot so they were very happy to move us to a table in a cooler position
5
I enjoyed a lot this restaurant, every meal we ordered was very very good,
Good portions
Pad thai is one of the most delicious i've ever tasted, so the tom yum soups.
Staff very friendly.
4
Great thai dishes..make sure to order Pad Thai, Green Curry, Mango Salad and Chicken Pandan. Worth the money! Me and my wife's fav.
4
Very good mango salad, pad thai and we loved the green curry, and of course try the Thai Tea. Better if sitting outside with nice view and music to chill. Loved the service very customer oriented, good staff overall...kudos!!!
4
Dinner was almost like in Thailand. You are greeted by "Sawasdee krub.." And a smile. We order spring rolls, green curry, fish cakes, mixed vegetable and papaya salad. I must say all the food was good. I was pleasantly surprised. Will definitely come again.
5
Have been here more then 7 years, food still impress me and service is so warm and excellent. outlet looks a bit old but the view from sentosa its just nice to seat ,especially to all the couples and youngster.Hear from them they will doing a major renovation by next march 2015.i am so exciting to wait the new thai accent transform
4
Thai Accent at Vivo City had a great view of the yachts and the sea, which is especially lovely in the evenings. The food here gave me a nostalgia of my stay in BKK at thrice the cost! But since I was really missing BKK, I went ahead for it. The service was nice and the ambience was perfect
4
Great food, a bit pricey compared to other restaurants in the area but for this level of service definitely worth it . Went there for a birthday celebration and the staff helped store the cake for us and went the further step of setting up the candles and providing us utensils to have it with. All with a smile! On a side note never had a chance to fully empty my glass of water - always refilled promptly :
5
Whenever I crave for THAI food and got enough budget, Thai Accent is my choice. Yummy favorites are Mango salad & Thai rice. The food taste great but a bit pricey. In terms of the service level, I guess it depends at what time you are going there. It is subjective as there are variables to consider. Even in any restaurants, the service turns out to be poor during peak time. Fairly enough, only a few resto and crew can cope up with high demands
5
If you are waiting for your ferry to Batam, or grabbing a lunch before spending your day at Sentosa, this is the right place!From the restaurant, you can see the Sentosa and it's a pretty sight at night. The food is also good, for those Thai food lovers, this place has got good Tom Yang Goong!Expect the place to be crowded at night though and you'll have to Q, I mean, all the restaurants in Vivo City are usually crowded during dinner time so yeah :
3
This isn't my first visit at Thai accent. I remember telling people that the food was great! Service was great.Today I came in and the restaurant is not full. Perhaps its my odd hour of lunch.. its 330pm by the way. As usual I have my favorite Tom Yam soup. Almost to the end of my soup, to my horror, I saw a short curly hair on my fish meat!The squid as usual is not fresh. The fish is fresh this time but... Hair.... No.. no..The manager immediately apologised and waived off our bill for that and top it off with a cuppa latte. The fact is kitchen staff should be trained to observe the cleanliness & freshness of food. No point letting the service staff taking the blame.Hope the management can enforced on the above. Thai accent should be betterÂ just like how it started
2
This restaurant looks swanky, but it's a bit chaotic. We were forgotten by our server and had to hunt down another one. Then, the meal — I ordered a simple pad thai — lacked any kind of kick.
4
For a god spicy Thai food must try this restaurant.
Must try the lemon fish, we also ordered minced ckn rice and prawn fried rice. The service was prompt.
Little bit expensive considering the ambience.
Great place !!!
5
i had to queue for 15 minutes in Vivo City to get into this restaurant. I ordered Chicken green curry, grilled spare ribs & phaid thai. all of them were good. For dessert i had sticky rice with fresh mango, it was good too
4
Love love love it! The Pandan Chicken is simply to die for. The food is excellent the staff a little cold!
4
You should try the Pad Thai, Tom yam, & Steam fish. They are excellent food to order especially the Spicy one.
4
I went here with my husband for an early lunch today, as most of the Chinese restaurants there were closed, for Chinese New Year. We had green curry chicken, which in my view, is not too spicy; stir-fried beef, in which the portion of the beef can be more, and stir-fried gangkong, with garlic sauce. Overall, the atmosphere is very good, as the Chinese New Year songs were playing, which gives you a feel of the festival. Other than the beef, the quality of the food is really good. Would consider coming back again with my husband for a meal
5
My husband and I found this Thai on our first trip to Singapore and loved it, so we went back on our second trip and loved it again. The Thai fish cakes are beautiful. If you can get a seat overlooking the water it is amazing. Definitely an option if staying on Sentosa and want something different.
4
Huge selection of Thai dishes, though not many curries, to choose from. Fairly efficient service. Everything we ordered was very tasty, though some of it was too spicy for the children (for example the mango salad that came with the starter combo). Very good pad thai noodles. If I were to be picky, I would say that the pineapple rice was too stuffed with sultanas and too light on pineapple. Simple but delicous desert of sticky rice, mango and coconut milk

We went to this restaurant after a day at Universal Studios and we were starving. We ordered the food and drinks at 20:56 and there were two empty tables near our table.The drinks took around 15 minutes to arrive. Spring rolls and fish cakes 15 more. We select the food without chilis (meaning spicy) because we have 2 small kids, but the fish cakes had so much pepper it was spicy! We complain to the manager that said he was sorry and ofered to cancel the order. So far so good. Around 21:30 we start looking around and the before empty tables were having dinner!!! We still had no food, and some of the food in the other tables were the same that we ordered. We decided to leave and asked for the bill of the drinks and the spring rolls but the waiter gave us the bill for all the food ordered. We refused to pay and asked for the manager that was on the phone and let us waiting by the cashier 5 more minutes (21:45, still no dinner!). Then we complained that more than 45 minutes after our order we didn't had any food and all the others that arrived after, asked same kind of food was eating and he said he would ask the kitchen to make the order faster. I said we didn't want to wait anymore, and to give us the bill only for the drinks and spring rolls but he said he would pay for it (one nice gesture, at least). So we just left the place almost one hour after we arrived, without dinner!!

i found this restaurant at Vivo City,Singapore when my hubby and i so desperately want to eat tom yam soup, then we saw the ambience form outside was good, infront of the harbour, so variatif thai menu. You must try tom yam soup and phad thai (noodle) with prawn, also chicken pandan leaves, they are so yummy
