Everything was perfect except for the music is too loud for my liking. Had to talk real loud to compete with the music and nobody is dancing. Everyone was talking loudly.
4
Excellent cocktails, decent food and great ambience to hang out with friends. Will surely visit again
5
I've been here a few times and love it every time. I love the vibe and atmosphere, and they make delicious cocktails.
4
Great food and attentive arrives. Standout dishes were the Pork Colllar and the Burrata. Staff were efficient. Not a big rum drinker but other drink options were sufficient. Surprised this place isn’t busier.
4
Didn’t expect great quality good at a bar (albeit an Asia TOP 50 one). Hanger steak was flavourful and done just rest. Cocktails did not disappoint, must try!
5
Fantastic cocktails are expected from the Jigger & Pony group; still I was mighty delighted by the Sugarhall Daiquiri (made with fermented banana). Even more surprising was the food. We had the Burrata & Broccolini and Iberico Pork Collar. Both were delicious, though the fattiness of the pork collar may get to you by the end so it could be good for more than two. Looking forward to their next opening, Caffe Fernet

Sugarhall Bar & Grill Located 102 Amoy Street, Singapore .Located along Amoy Street, this quaint yet modern casual bistro provides the perfect venue where we enjoyed excellent food and drinks that delivered a memorable dining experience and gastronomic indulgence. The only drawback was the Music was too loud to my ears. The staff are fantastic, they presented flawless service, friendly and professional. The attentiveness and enthusiasm of the service made for an enjoyable, evening. Great place to unwind. Definitely must try. Absolutely the best place in town. Highly recommended!!
5
Was around the area and needed some drinks after a long day at work.Tried Jigger and Pony but they didn’t have any bar seats available. Bummer.Went to Sugarhall instead and was delighted. The beef was excellent and the drinks were fun. Great place for a solo lady to enjoy great food and drinks without having to worry about sleazy crowd.It’s really upbeat but casual and friendly at the same time.Would love to check out their weekends
5
Had a fantastic dinner starting with a happy hour cocktail of an Aperol Spritz. The Charcuterie platter with the 400 gr Pork Collar was delicious. My only feedback is that for a restaurant with such wonderful cuisine the music should not be so loud. I'll be back.
4
Nice place to relax & catch up with friends. Staff are polite & attentive.3 of us shared the French Fries, Whole Spring Chicken, Grilled Prawns, Pork chop & finish off with the Chocolate Brownie. Portions were just nice.Music was a little loud but otherwise, a nice place to meet up.
4
Nice ambience, good steak and sides, interesting cocktails. Service staff behaved a little overzealous in clearing your (almost empty) plates though, else a rather enjoyable place.
4
Really nice ambience but food was a little slow to arrive. Other than that, everything was mostly perfect.
4
We had gotten one of their punch bowls, the southside punch, which was really potent and delicious. The fries were also really tasty.
5
Good service, good food, great collection of rums, and a very nice experience. Will try again soon !
5
Went there for dinner and drinks. Had pork collars as main, and other small dishes. Nice setting. I will go again
5
After walking around trying to find a nice bar to have a drink to finish the night - this was the perfect bar. Really nice funky bar and the bar tenders were so friendly. Definitely would recommend anyone to go here.
5
I was told that this bar makes good cocktails and have quite a huge selection of them to choose from. I didn't get to try all but manage to try 2 of their selections. I was there for a dinner and manage to try their food as well. The food is very good and delicious. Service is really good probably due to the less crowded place. The only disadvantage I must pinpoint is the price. It is towards high range. A dinner (just main dish) + 1 happy hour cocktail would easily cost you about $70 per person. If you order drinks on non-happy hour + main dish, it will cost you at least $80 per person WITHOUT side dish. I will come back for their drinks definitely, not much for the food. Great place for gatherings so can go in a group! Very spacious and can accommodate large groups
5
Referring to a list of top Asian bars, we paid visit to this marvelous bar in town area. The atmosphere was typical night style with good service provided by smily waitress. The drinks are of very good taste which I seldom have in Singapore, a range of choices are available. A wonderful place to drop by after a long week.
3
i went with my friends at weekdays night. not many people inside. the happy hour not as cheap as other bar. got a lot of discount.
4
Came here with a friend this week to try the cocktails during happy hour. A small selection of cocktails available at $14++ until 7.30pm. Sitting at the bar is fun as you get to interact with the bar staff and watch the effort they go to in preparing the cocktails. Decent atmosphere inside. Worth another visit for sure
4
Loved the taste and plating of the small plates.
Attentive service and staff helped to introduce food according to different preferences.
Great ambience too. Just a pity we were under the speakers and had to keep shouting at each other to talk.
4
we had a couple of sharing plates and everything turned out awesome! Great service and friendly staff!
5
Cosy atmosphere, very attentive staff and great cocktails. Went there for dinner and drinks. Food was good but not a lot of options for dessert.
5
We came here to have drinks after dinner one day and was pleasantly surprised by how fun and delicious all the drinks were and how friendly the bartenders were. They were really good about customizing drinks based on what we wanted.
5
Lovely staff and great food. Perfect place for a fun night out with friends. Appreciated how patient the staff was when we were late to our reservation as we were finishing drinks next door at Jigger and Pony.
4
The atmosphere was lovely. The drinks were interesting if a little weak. The short ribs were great as was the burrata though the broccoli had huge chunks of garlic.
5
In the hip Amoy Street, lined with cocktail bars, is this awesome place. Only place in Singapore with Whiskey Sour on happy hour, friendly bartenders, great food - snacks, and mains.
4
A bar that is said to be focused on rum, however actually appeares as quite a normal bar with some slightly higher number of rums compared to others. The drinks are nice but could be better and more on point. Of course that depends on who is preparing the drinks. If the person is focused on preparing shots for the guests and making some noise it simply can't work out well. Nevertheless, not a bad location
4
Was there for their Negroni week event and had some of my best ever Negronis. Special shoutout to the Sonic Negroni which had lots of nuance and depth in flavour.Unfortunately it was really crowded and busy on that day however, so I had a hard time getting the attention of the staff there
4
I went to Sugarhall for a relaxed and cozy dinner with my girlfriend on a Saturday evening. I, myself have been there before, but only for cocktails.We got a nice corner table, from where we could enjoy the design of the place, that surely must have taken inspiration from a Caribbean rum factory. We ordered a Coconut Daiquiry and a beer while looking over the menu.We decided to go for the "Prawns" as a starter but unfortunately they were sold out. Our waitress then recommended the "Ocean Trout" instead which was on point. The combination of avocado, cucumber and the burnt rice/almond foam accompanied the taste of the trout to perfection. For the main course we decided to go for the "Hanging Tender Steak" together with "Smoked Potatoes". Once again a perfectly prepared dish. The steak that we ordered medium rare was tender and lean. Our side which was the smoked potatoes were served with Parmesan and creme fraiche, which added a nice freshness and fattiness to the smokey taste.Overall, an absolute perfect meal, and top of the range for its price class
4
Excellent friendly bartenders. Was first introduced to the corpse reviver here by the Aussie Bar Manager. Delicious food too. Great venue for late night drinks and it helps to also be situated in the very trendy Amoy Street!
4
Nice trendy hangout with good cocktails, good food. Loud music, so not for people with hearing problems or if you want to have a group conversation. But very nice experience over all.
4
Great catch up with friends location. The staff were very attentive and Eve though the place was full there was never a huge wait. Will definitely be back!
4
Chose this place for a birthday dinner. Very good steak in Singapore for a good price. We had the tenderloin must try. Fresh and tasty prepared. Lot of attention to detail.
4
Perhaps a wrong place to wind up one's 80th birthday celebrations in one of the best - run night spot bar & grill in downtown Singapore, but certainly never too old to enjoy its high-spirited music amidst attentive, friendly and trendy ambience with our young ones! The food and drinks may not be the best in town but the "maddening crowd" around is classy, gentle and totally well-mannered. The street is at the verge of the CBD and well-lit at night without congestion. Taxi service is always on standby at the shopfront .

My husband and I dined at Sugarhall a little over a week ago and were blown away by the food. The menu is full of creative and interesting dishes, many available as 'small plates' so that you can share them and try more. The grilled cabbage with polenta was fabulous, I've never had cabbage that tasted that good. The beef short rib was tender and beautifully cooked, and I loved the combination of onions, sauce and sweet potato that came with it. Desserts were great too, the banana crumble is one of the best desserts I've had in a long time. The food was creative and full of flavour, truly excellent. On top of that, the staff were wonderful. Everyone we interacted with was so friendly. The woman who served us was fantastic, some of the best service we've had in Singapore. She was knowledgeable about the food options, our water glasses never got below half full and she updated us on the progress of our food whenever there was a delay in getting plates out due to the busy kitchen. The only thing we weren't 100% thrilled with was the atmosphere, which was a bit loud with the after work drinks crowd. But the staff were aware of this and we were given a nice table near the back, away from the noisier bar. They let us know they will be changing their menu soon, and I'm already planning a return visit to try the new dishes
5
It was just a simple reservation made on Chope but Sugarhall actually printed out a little card with my name on it. The wait staffs were very attentive to our needs and water was refilled without having to ask. Will definitely be back for the bikini sandwich and pork chop and sirloin
4
Great bar with a lively atmosphere, we visited after dinner and stayed far longer than we originally planned to which is clearly a positive sign.While there is obviously a strong focus on a vast variety of rums, the team created all sorts of great cocktails for our group that immediately put everybody into a great mood!I am looking forward to bringing a bigger crowd with me and staying for dinner next time, great job
5
We came here as a group of 5 for NYEs and while we didnt stay there to countdown, we had a great feast. The cocktail menu was v interesting and the one cocktail i tried was quite potent. We mainly drank wine and beer. The food however was world class. We ordered almost everything off the menu. And maybe because it was not crowded, the chef really put his/her everything into the dishes. The chicken was cooked perfectly, even the breast meat. The steak was perfect. The pork chops were juicy, moist and cooked perfectly with a slight pink tinge in the middle. The sweet potato puree was out of this world. My friend loved the bikini sandwiches. In short, food was good! We also had the earl grey panna cotta but felt it would have nicer matched with a cookie crumble instead of the passion fruit. Prices are a little pricy for the portions
4
Read an article that Sugarhall makes the BEST Mai Tais so just had to try. Also read they had Happy Hour, however our drinks didn't fall within that category. They were pricey -- almost $52 for 2 drinks. I've had better but my wife enjoyed hers
5
Excellent atmosphere and great food. Had the steak, which was good value. Run cocktails were really good !
4
Didnt have the food and sat at the bar for after dinner drinks. Great vibe, fantastic mixologist which encouraged you to try and kept giving you tasters. What more do you need for a good night ?
4
Nice décor and atmosphere. Liked the Darjeeling cocktail but not the one with grenadine (taste like cough syrup). Fries and squid ink orzo were all tasty and good size. Ribeye was well grilled but portion was disappointing for the price point.
4
Place was too noisy for a decent conversation with friends.
But other than that, food and service are great!
5
Certainly a compulsory choice, both carte du hour and beverage list are sui generis!
Cocktails were prepared to perfection, our entrées were piquant, fragrant flavours which were truly tantalising!
4
Food was delicious! Especially the vegetables! Servers were attentive and were able to make recommendations.
4
Had a lovely birthday dinner at Sugarhall. I love the ambience with its warm lighting and cosy fittings. And the awesome looking bar with 3 shelves full of alcohol We had a mix response with the food in our group of 6. The burrata looked very watery and was kinda melting on the plate. It is also a really tiny portion. The steak was not bad, but didn't make me want to go back for more. The pork chop was delicious! Perfectly cooked and seasoned well. The best bit of the experience for me was the service. The staff were attentive and accommodating. And even let us split our bill into 3 credit cards with differing amounts.
4
Food was good but portions were not impressive so order the big plates for value for money. Though i mentioned it was my birthday dinner, no special additional offerings were made. Most restaurants would offer a free dessert or something. I will return as they have fabulous drinks but not for special occasions.
5
The drinks were really good! I'm very partial to sweet drinks, and they made these very well when we visited. The alcohol was strong, but never overwhelming. (I am very gay, so I know what I am saying about alcohol.)The food was very interesting. It was flavorful, quite well-balanced. I particularly enjoyed the trout. The service was really good. Our server Doha was very pleasant but never patronizing. She was extremely helpful when we were too hesitant to decide. She knew what she was doing, and it was comforting. The ambience is good, and the music was cool. It was a little loud for my taste, but I barely noticed it as more people came in.
5
You should go here, I will be back and found this place out from a good local. Fine service, drinks (extensive spirits and whiskey drinks), fine food later although I was mainly taking easy racked up a few fine wines. Not cheap, especially if you have friends like mine but worth it....
5
food is surprising good for a bar! Plus excellent service and interesting cocktails makes this place definitely worth a return visit!
5
i usually go here for a drink after work , or after dinner where i know that i would have a good cocktail experience with great ambiance.
5
Bar staff friendly and knowledgeable. We had some great rums. Their home made ginger beer incredible. Recommend the Dark & Stormy cocktail.
We also ordered some snacks. Calamari cooked very well. The bone marrow extremely flavoursome.
5
If you want a consistent experience from the start till the end of your dinner, and your friends thanked you for bringing them here, Sugarhall is the diner place to go. Cocktails are must-try! Steak is a must-have! Not forgetting the cocktail master, he is quite a winner, shant tell you who, it is for you to find out! Enjoy!!
4
Happy hour at Sugarhall lasts from 5.30 to 7.30pm with a selection of cocktails for $14 and beer for $10. The Daquiri and Amaro Spritz were boozy and hit the spot. Had the smoked duck with scrambled salted egg and the good old pork chop off the main menu - both were tasty and well executed. The pork chop in particular is worth coming back for, though a bit overpriced at $30
4
We were recommended this bar by another cocktail bar and they were right. Really friendly staff, good busy atmosphere and music. Menu looked quite interesting (particularly the "small plates") although we had already noodled up beforehand so did not try. Bar specialises in rum with over 90 types of rum listed including such treats as Ron Zacapa. We were just going to have one cocktail but the first round was so moreish we tried two or three. Bumbo Old Fashioned was excellent, and their takes on Mai Tai, Dark & Stormy were good also. Others tried Coconut Daiquiri, Peanut Butter Cup and Columbus Circle as far as I can remember. None were found wanting. Staff were great and liked cool and buzzing, but friendly, ambience. Will go back to check out the food and some more of the cocktails. Happy hour from 5:30-7:30 pm looks a good deal with cocktails down from around S$22 to S$14, but with a choice of only 5
5
Went on a Friday night with a group of 12 pax. We were given the long communal table, which provided ample space to move around without getting in the way of other patrons. Served by Hazel and Doha - who earlier were diligent in texting me details of my reservation. We ordered double of everything on happy hour, and one each of the food items. Cocktails were flavorful and packed the correct punch of liquor. Food came out promptly, in good portions and done well. Their steaks were perfectly done (medium rare) with awesome flavor. We had ordered 2 servings of the beef skirt (i think), and one tasted "off" compared to the other. The kitchen disagreed, but was happy to re-fire a new serving. We opted to swap it for a cocktail instead... which Hazel obliged. Overall, great place.
4
Headed here quite late in the evening after a few happy hour drinks. We ordered pretty much all the sharing platters and the food was exceptionally good. The decor is very cool and the atmosphere was great (until we arrived anyway as we were a bit noisy.) A great place for a group of friends to get together.
4
Recommended by a friend, we came here for cocktails and were not disappointed! Far less crowded than their sister bar, Jigger and Pony just next door, we found Sugarhall a lot cooler (in terms of music and people there that night) and more space at the bar.Bartenders were super knowledgable and friendly, cocktails took interesting twists on classic drinks. Would recommend coming at happy hour. Really happy with this place and will return the next time we're in the city
4
Went out with friends for a mid-week drinks evening. We had some Happy Hour Cocktails (Planters Punch and Whisky Sour) and regular cocktails (American Beauty, Peanut Butter Cup, Old Cuban), and to eat, we had the Fries, Antipasto, and the Broccolini-Burrata. The drinks were potent - really well-mixed and tasted amazing. The Fries were crisp and delicious, and the Garlic Mayo accompanying it was awesome. On the whole, the food and drinks were terrific. The service was great and so was the ambiance
4
Steak was absolutely amazing. I'd also recommend the kale. Always love the cocktails! Love the vibe, trendy without being pretentious
2
Enjoyed a steak here several times, but this time the quality of the steak was terrible it was actually inedible.
4
Excellent food, amazing drinks, fun and relaxed atmosphere, and a team that are always eager to please! The best chicken in town!
5
The food is really good! Recommending the slow roast chicken and the kale crisps with beet root. Perhaps the cocktails can be nicer?
4
My family and I booked dinner at Sugarhall for Gourmet Greens Week and we had the special vegetarian tasting menu. The food's taste and presentation were both excellent. The service was attentive and friendly.
4
I have been here a couple of times now. Each time the meat was pretty good (great pork chop) and the side dishes imaginative and decent.The "but" is I am just not sure it's that good for the prices. $50++ for a steak is pretty toppy for a bar/grill setting, the cocktails are not as good as next door's (I was tempted to see if J&P would deliver) and the house wines are fairly ordinary.Service is good and the staff are quite attentive so plus marks there.As with most bars in this part of the world, the music is just way too loud so I am doubtful I will go back too often
3
Eating at SugarHall was like playing "Will you be my Valentine?" No, not this time. I am constantly looking for that "Go To" resturant in Singapore - the one that you rave about and highly recommend to others and they go, and they rave about. SugarHall is not "that" restaurant, food-wise.I walked into in with high expectations. I immediately liked the decor and the menus looked good. The service was attentive - my water glass was always, always full. I had a burrata, which was delicious - creamy and a hint of lemon with perfect caramelization on the fresh fig. My colleague had the snow crab, with edamame and smoked oyster aoli, which was very nice. Our plates came out 10 minutes apart though and as I had mine first, my colleague was a bit distressed and thought his order had been forgotten. For all intensive purposes, I suspect that is what happend.I had a mocktail while waiting, which I enjoyed. My colleague had a lovely daquiri. We tried to talk and pass the time but the music was really loud, and with everyone talking to compensate, we were shouting at each other, peppered with "WHAT? WHAT?!" I did like the music, A LOT. The vibe of the restaurant was good. It seemed like a good place to come with friends, but if you want a quite place to talk, this is not it!We both ordered steaks - a rib eye and a tenderloin. Mine was underdone, his was overdone, and there was NO SEASONING at all on the steaks. I have never actually had a piece of meat that was so bland. I asked for salt and pepper and even then, the meat just lacked character. A chimichurra was served on the side, but it tasted weird, like bitter, vinagirette mustard with something red in there that was slightly off. I ordered kale as a side dish, which was nicely seasoned and had a goof flavor, a stark contrast to my steak ($44 for meat on a plate). For dessert, I had a pumpkin creme brulee that was nice.All together, I paid $134 for a starter, a steak, a side, and a dessert, and a mocktail. I guess these are Singapore prices, and the food was pretty decent. I say this because if I had had a glass of wine, or some of the cocktails, I expect the bill would have been a lot more.... I'd recommend this restaurant if you want to get drunk, order a big rum punch bowl (That looks cool!) and have a laugh with friends especially if you aren't so worried about value for money with your food. If you are not on the booze, like me, you might want to keep searcing for your "IT" place
4
Full disclosure: we are a married couple 35+ that's likes to hear one another. Sugarhall has great food and service. It was way too loud for us. If you are looking for a lively place, this is a good option for you. If you want to have a chat with your dinner partner, I'd consider Sister restaurant Humpback which also has really good food but is quieter :)
5
I went for the vegetarian menu during the Gourmet Greens week and the food was incredibly delicious, especially the beetroot tartin and the spiced polenta. The Bumbo Old-fashioned was a great drink as well, with flavours enhanced by a burnt cinnamon stick which interestingly doubled as a straw.
4
My mother is a vegetarian, and she thoroughly enjoyed her meal at Sugarhall. The Gourmet Greens menu was innovative and delicious. From the amuse bouche to dessert (4 courses in between), we enjoyed every bite (with the exception of the gnocchi, 4th course). I'm very glad I picked Sugarhall for the Gourmet Greens week. Wonderful experience for a fabulous night out with mom. The staff were sweet! My mom's only 'complaint' was that it was too noisy..
4
Just love the doneness of the pork n the sauce goes super well with it. Pair it with the sweet potato side on their garden menu.
overall a great experience
4
Enjoyed the cozy ambience though it's bit noisy at times.
Took opportunity of the happy hour specials and the whiskey sour was good.
No daily special being offered this round, so I was a bit disappointed.
Overall experience is good.
4
Nice food, service a bit slow - vegetables after the meat was eaten! Great bar, great rum selection..
4
We stopped at this place by coincidence during happy hour and we were pleasantly surprised by the cool cocktails, friendly atmosphere and mellow music. We didn't try the food but would definitely recommend it for drinks and a fun time.
4
It's a really nice place for a casual night out with friends or even a date. The plates for the sides were a little too big for the table. Would suggest new platings to encourage customers to order more sides to share.
2
Food is little and expensive. Keep having to order more. Not the standard size. More like tasting menu. Music is so loud it is inconducive to chat there.
4
We enjoyed the food, the drink, and the music a lot. Plus the staffs there are friendly. Quite good service.
4
Went for dinner on a Saturday night... great service from all the staff, cocktails were good too, place has a clubby vibe hence come to party, not to have a quiet or romantic evening... Food was surprisingly good, we particularly liked the babaganoush, the crispy kale, burnt carrots and the scallops... Overall a pleasant experience at a reasonable price..
5
Albeit Sugahall is just down the road from where we live, we had not ventured there until the other night. It will now be our local.Fantastic rum based cocktails, a fantastic selection of food and the absolute best bar tenders and staff. In Singapore, good customer service is rare, but these guys know there stuff.We enjoyed a few cocktails each, my favorite was the navy strength rum - wish I remembered its name now! The divine staff also let us sample different rum whilst we sipped on our cocktails. They were very engaging and really made our experience memorable
4
This is a very cool rum bar with a welcoming atmosphere. The the rum based cocktails are to die for. However, improvement on their quality of wine by the glass is needed. The dinner we had was very good. Good background music and lots of people talking and simply having a good time. Service is excellent and the bar staff obviously enjoy the job and have an indepth knowledge of the various rum drinks on their shelf
4
Unusual cocktails, great selection of rum, and innovative cuisine; sweetbreads with poached pear, and foi gras profiteroles, just two of the items that come to mind! Great staff, and a welcoming feel on entering! Definitely will be back to try the other interesting menu items!
5
Excellent food, cocktails and service as always. You must try the bone marrow, chicken and the sauteed kale. Yummy!
4
Didn't try the food but was very impressed with the cocktails and the bar manager's skill in mixing them. Good place to finish a night. Worth trying particularly if you're looking for rum.
4
The roasted beetroot starter is a definitely must try! My lamb shoulder was grilled perfectly and I loved the cocktails. Staff were attentive and the place has a casual cool vibe to it.
5
Not an extension menu but enough good food to satisfy any cravings. Highlights were steak, pork chop and the many sides - brussel sprouts, mushrooms, zucchini were all favourites. We ordered 2 out of the 3 desserts on offer as we didn't want to try the foie gras ice cream.Tip: We ordered a bottle of rum with mixers to have on the rocks, which were great.
4
We had a great time at Sugarhall thanks to the great food and warm service. We had the sweet potato and sautÃ©ed mushrooms sides and the pork and lamb chops mains. The food was well cooked and seasoned. Portions were generous. The service staff were wonderful as well. Very attentive, always checking to ask if our food was ok and always noticing that we needed top up for our water. Thanks for the great service
5
Sugarhall is a great place to chill out after work with friends. Close enough to the business district and yet with a laid back vibe which is perfect for unwinding. Food is immaculate, with the beef, lamb, chicken and marrow all excellent. And to top it off, a well curated rum and spirits menu as well. If I have one tiny gripe it is that the music is just a touch too loud for me. Did not seem to bother the other diners though. Will be back often
4
Drinks here are consistently good; the food not so much. My experience is that the veg-based starters and sides tend to be better (ironic for a place that prides itself on its grill!) and the food menu is overpriced. The steak is served with no sides, except half a grilled tomato. However, service is always great, the staff are cheerful and helpful. Drinks marked "strong" on the menu are actually strong - a rarity in Singapore! The music can be a bit loud at times for conversations in big groups
2
Went here for a friends Birthday and the servers actually sent one friend to the wrong table even though he gave the correct booking name the guy was clueless....The mains here are either a piece of meat or fish on a plate with nothing else forcing you to make side ordera which just made this very average meal very expensive!Cocktails were average too.....and again over priced
1
Important but casual business dinner was a disaster from start to finish with the worst trained staff and unbelievably incapable management that clearly chose the wrong business. In the cold light of the next day I polled all the guests and without exception they said it was by far the worst dining experience in Singapore. Why? - on arrival the introduction from the 'manageress' that our own waitress "will be taking care of you tonight" set the worst possible expectation. - 20 minutes before we could order a pre dinner drink! A bottle of red and white for the table seemed like a simple request? - A further 15 minutes and individual white wine glasses started to appear. No red, no bottle for the table. - The steaks were mixed up (medium went to the wrong person and rare to the other!). - The salmon was raw and sent back. Eventually we told them not to bother with it as they had no clue what to do. Seriously! - Random extras appeared that weren't ordered. Everything came out at different times. - Potatoes arrived for the steak after the steak was eaten. Etc, etc, etc. I had 1 lawyer and 1 legally trained exec there also and yet the 'Managers' insisted we should pay the full bill!! Despite half of it not arriving and the rest was just wrong or pure inedible. They argued their cause (please!!!) trying to defend the indefensible. In days of social media and review sites they really should know better - but maybe that's the point. They do not and hence the comment about in the wrong business. Look out for other reviews on other sites.
