Came back here last week for lunch with some friends. The lunch deal is really good value at $10++ for a bowl of porridge and a dim sum. Very happy to keep coming back here while the lunch deal lasts.

Just OK. Perhaps we should have checked about their specialty, but since the name had the word BBQ, we ordered the bbq. Which was just normal and wasn't anything special. The meat was too chewy.

This Korean GinsengChicken texture is excellent, with whole
small chicken steaming hot in Korean Ginseng soup.Price
reasonabe.What I dislike is after the BBQ smell on my hair
and clothes.

When I made a reservation over the phone, I was appalled by the lack of customer service. Fine, I proceeded because I was craving for Korean BBQ.During the order-taking, I was told that the banchan was complimentary and I went on to order 2 plates of marinated pork fillet. After ordering another plate of marinated pork fillet and my 3rd round of refill of banchan, I was told that they were not able to refill the banchan as I had exceeded the limit of 3 rounds. I told them that I was aware that it was complimentary, but was not communicated on the number of refills. I told the waitress that had I known that they could only refill up to 3 rounds, I would not have ordered that additional plate of marinated pork fillet. What was I going to do with just white rice and BBQ pork fillet

Their speciality is of course the ginseng chicken soup and for this alone, it's worth thevisit. Although it is a medicinal dish most people can appreciate it because the ginseng is not too heavily dosed. There's also all the various Korean pickles to wake your taste buds. The service is discreet and efficient. Can't wait to go again

@TheKuoKnowsSomething has happened to this once value-for-money diner. It was noticeable after the Crystal Jade brand was acquired for an eye-popping sum by a private-equity group.The restaurant is still pretty good, foodwise. The service is still exemplary, and the staff are still highly attentive. But it is not quite as economically-attractive as it once was.One way to get around the higher prices is to stick with the set BBQ menus - the portions are quite generous. Lots of side dishes too.If you are hankering for something with a bit of a kick, the Kimchi and Tofu soup is quite delicious. It also comes with a bowl of rice.Korean restaurants are now a common sight in Singapore. But Crystal Jade Korean Ginseng Chicken & BBQ still has the advantage of being located in the Orchard area. But will that be enough

Tried the Korean Ginseng Chicken while in Singapore Orchard road. The crystal Jade restaurant here specialize in Korean Dish. The chicken here is larger than that found in Korea, but the rice found inside the smaller. It is tender and the taste of ginseng was there. However I miss the ginseng wine that goes with it

The move from Level 4 to B2 is not so favourable for customers: There are now many more tables, yet the number of serving staff remains the same, so service is slow. Prices have gone up; as a result, this used to be a "not-great-food, but good-value" Korean restaurant (much like its Chinese cousin Crystal Jade Kitchen; in particular, the meat and soups are not first-class.) It is now less of a convincing argument to go here. If you want really good Korean BBQ, go elsewhere. But if you crave Korean food while shopping at Takashimaya, this is still the best at Ngee Ann City

Nice BBQ and local meal. The restaurant is located in the mail road called Orchard Road. Average price and good service give to this place good opportunities to be highly suggested and visited by the local and by the tourist.

one of my favorite Korean Restn. Good value family restaurant and service is good. Used to be packed but now easier to get seats.

Great Korean food. Value for money set lunches

Our business group ate here one night and the food just kept on coming. We oredered a pre-set dinner for 6 (since there were 6 of us) and we could have done with a dinner for 4. Grilling fresh meats at your table, with a variety of side dishes was fun. We had great food and great conversation. I really liked this place

I went there for my friend's farewell get-together. Located at 4th floor Ngee Ann city Orchard, Singapore. The place is not that big so pre-booking is must. However if you decided to eat there on a last minute basis, the crew will do their best and are friendly indeed to accommodate you, which is somehow very rare here in sg :D . Anyways, they are wearing nice Korean dresses as their uniform however i noticed that some are worn out already. Food wise, we ordered a set for 2 and we were surprised that the serving was a lot. Pretty much its good for 3. Over all experience was great however we were somehow rushing since we weren't really booked for that spot

This has become one of our favorite dining choice in Ngee Ann City. Pre-booking is a must as they are usually fully booked. However, they are also kind to accommodate and is usually able to squeeze in a slot for us. I used to avoid this place because I didn't like BBQ smell on my clothes and I did not want my young toddlers touching the hot plate. But apparently you could just get them to BBQ the meat for you. I love their BBQ Ox Tongue. My 6 year old loves the seaweed with beef soup, and their vegetables are great - almost like home cooked. The great thing about Korean food is that you can have the starters (6-7 small dishes, including the lovely kimchi) immediately. Healthy stuff to munch while waiting for your main dishes

In a sense, this restaurant is like its Chinese counterparts in the Crystal Jade stable, and more so the "Crystal Jade kitchen" variety. The food is consistentlly good, service is efficient, atmosphere is a bit non-descript, and it's good value. The BBQ meat is not as good as in the better Korean restaurants, however

The food was good. The Ginseng Chicken is a feast in the palate. The soup very delightful not mentioning that is healthy. Their fried rice as well is very filling and delicious. The thing that captured my attention is the fact that they serve 6 different types of appetizers and it is UNLIMITED. You can always ask for seconds and even thirds. It is very cozy. The servers were also attentive to your needs. The only thing that I didn't like about the place that it nis small and it was a bit noisy. I did not get the ambiance that I wanted when dining in a nice sit down restaurant.

I have been thinking of visiting this restaurant for the longest time ever. However as it is located on the 4th floor, it's out of sight hence out of mind. Was there for lunch and we ordered the stone cattle rice, seafood pancake and Saba fish. TotalBill was only $33.00! And that's with free flow yummy kimchi. I am not a fan of kimchi but I must say, they do their kimchi well.Can't wait to be back

The food they serve were good... Consider as verlu for money... Atmosphere a bit noisy and because of the open house BBQ u'll end up with BBQ smell at the end if event. Service a bit poor. Almost forgot the dishes I ordered. Definetly will be back again
