A good place for a quick breakfast. Serves toasted sandwiches which was something we were pleased to find. Coffee was good.
2
Paper coffee cups, plastic trays as plates , disinterested staff- a disappointing expensive experience.
3
We had the almond pie, mac and cheese, curry sausage and chococro box (via Foodpanda). All told their sweet stuff is decent, but the spicy/savoury dishes taste artificial.
3
We went here for breakfast. There was only 1 other customer at the time. The toasties were very slow coming and pretty average taste wise. A totally average experience but maybe we were too early in the morning.
3
If you want a place to people watch in aircon comfort, this is a good place for that. The dessert is a bit pricey for my taste but they are quite big in their portions to make up for it.
5
We tried the choco berry and choco banana Fuji. It was not so sweet and very yummy. But the Vietnam coffee was disappointing as it didn't taste like it. Overall, the desserts are better.
3
Must try freshly baked warm chococro, really good! I m not finding much else of interest, but the chococro were enough.

This is the quietest place at lunchtime in B1 of Raffles - they always have seats whereas other coffee shops are packed, with often a queue. Why? The food menu is very short, and the drinks extremely average. But if all you’re having is a cup of coffee or tea after lunch, then it’s perfect
4
a sweet tooth i cant keep up with, it's crowded near 6pm and near impossible to get seats for 2 so I'd to wait a bit before sitting down for a bite~the buzzer was for the Little Fuji with an ice cream topping which was served later~the water dispenser has a message that seating arrangements are never permanent hereChicken Pepper Cheese - unheated it's dry and crackly but okLittle Fuji - YUMzChelsea Chococro - a special edition of their signaturea very good location to meet if you drive and park in the basement carpark, it's right in front of the escalator

Located in the Basement, this cafe offers a reasonably peaceful space for a morning coffee and pastry.Coffee was just ok, maybe more to do with the milk. But the warmed cinnamon raisin Danish was perfect for a light morning snack.Prices are reasonable and staff are friendly. There are some padded comfortable chairs but get there early to grab one.

Busy but nice cafe for people watching. The Vietnamese coffee I ordered good. They changed menu. Was hoping to get the sandwiches they had before. Decent customer service.
3
It is popular for its desserts. however, I like the pastries more. Tried the desserts but not very impressive. I once pass by and get the pastries and found that it is good. next round i go back and tried more.
5
I think ladies would love all the desserts serve there! they don't really serve main course food but breads, waffles, biscuits are alternatives too!
3
A good place to stop for breakfast, snacks and refreshments while in Raffles City. Pastries were good but the coffee I'm afraid, simply missed the mark. The desserts and ice cream (which seemed to be popular) looked enticingly yummy but my waistline would suffer.
3
coffee wasn't great, but the butter danish - when heated up was good! i wouldn't recommend the latte as it was watery.
good for a chill time though as the aircon was good.

I had gone looking for a treat after an awesome hawker market food. This place is unique as you can treat yourself based on your appetite. I got the Matcha Cone which fit the bill.

Went with my family to St. Marc Cafe at Changi City Point last weekend. The staff were so un friendly and rude - one of the worst I have ever encountered. They gave us our cakes, after warming it in the oven, on the dirty TRAY - without any plates. When I asked why its not being served on plates - the girl answered me - almost yelling at me - that I should take the plates by myself....(?) and I thought I was supposed to get the cake on a plate.... silly me ha?Later saw these girls - 2 staff girls - yelling at some other costumer. Would never go there again!!!!
3
Stopped in here for a Pastrami set and what I received was just average. It wasn't as nicely prepared as the poster depicting it, but it was acceptable as a diversion.The desserts looked tasty....too rich for my diet!This wasn't compelling enough for me to return. There are many other eateries here to try next time
4
We were tempted to order the choco banana fuji when we stopped here for coffee and tea after lunch. The staff told us that the dessert was ice cream on a danish pastry. We decided to try as the display looked good. The dessert was yummy, with flaky pastry topped with vanilla ice cream, chocolate sauce and one cut banana. The combination worked well together with coffee or tea. Would definitely come back to try other flavour

~dessert after lunch at Raffles City the Elvis at St Marc CafÃ© sure delivers the message that washes pure dessert satisfaction down ~the cornflakes inside the cone supporting the lovely soft serve vanilla ice cream on tops is a sight to see and as yummy, just a great idea :
5
Enjoy this cafe for casual meetups and chats with friends. Excellent and prompt service, great matcha and other drinks in better sizes than the humongous mugs and unnecessary calories at the usual coffee joints.

Visited the stall at changi city point.
The set up was pretty standard I suppose. Coffee were good and the pastry was nice. It's a good chill out place to catch up.
The serving staff over the counter quick and accurate with the orders.
5
The little Fuji is must try! Hot baked crispy bread and vanilla ice cream on TOP of it added with caramel sauce !
4
I went to this place for my sweet tooth after dinner. Walking in just 10 mins before their closing time. Every staffs still smiling and eager to serve. I ordered Elvis which soft serve ice cream in sugar cone with slide banana inside. Ice Cream was creamy and texture was very smooth. Not too fast to melt. The sugar cone was little sweet and crispy. Definitely I will return to this place again in the future.

Not a place to come to if you are watching your waistline - the chocolate pancake is nicer in the photos than in person. But then there is the ice-cream! And then they have the drinks like the macha coffee which is extremely rich and creamy. And if you lucky enough, then you can one of those comfortable sofas in the café

Was at the newly opened branch in Changi Business Park. Nice ambience for a relaxing cuppa and indulgent dessert. We had lunch nearby and chanced upon this cafe. Great latte and an excellent yuzu tea but what was superb was the Nara dessert - creamy vanilla and matcha ice cream with a generous dollop of red bean paste and refreshing matcha jelly. A perfect combination!Worth a visit just for this!
4
I did not had this tasty an amazing desert. The more you dig in, more you love it. Full of flavors. However was disappointed as what we ordered first was over, i mean they were running out of many dishes, even this banana split has to be with vanilla ice cream but as they were running out they offered chocolate. But must try if you love desserts.
3
I like to drink green tea latte and will definitely try it in different places. Once I try the green tea latte there, I feel a bit disappointed as it doesn't taste nice. As compare to Starbucks, I personally think that the drinks and desserts there a bit pricey. The dessert that I recommended there is the chocolate banana Fuji

We went to St Marc Café recently on a early Saturday evening and don't have a problem to find seats which is unusual for this time and location actually. However, it was our 1st time visit and we tried some of their ice cream creations which you can order in a cone or on top of a Danish pastry. Portion are quite reasonable and overall experience was ok, even tough server could pay more attention to cleanliness and customer sevice
4
This is a super little cafe that offer drinks for approximately £1.90, sandwiches for £2.46 and savoury pastries for £1.60 - those are very good eat-in prices.The tables are kept very clean by the staff and there is a high turnover of customers sot hat tells me it is very p0opular with local people and therefore good for tourists.I would definately visit there again when in Singapore
3
Tried mango flavored dessert, not bad but pricy for the taste and quantity, located nearby to Clarke quay and raffles place, additional toppings would have been better I guess
3
Chain coffee stores rarely serve decent coffee and St Marc's is no exception to this rule. Coffee is acceptable enough but definitely not as good as might be desired. That said, in the vicinity there is a very limited choice.
5
My dearest friend treated me to ice cream at this cafe and it was unforgettable. I enjoyed the cinammon bun and ice cream.. Never have i had such an enjoyable time eating ice cream. Truly delicious.
5
Spend your whole day shopping here, and Little Fuji, an unforgettable sweet treat is a perfect way to call it a day. You'll love the warm croissant, the smooth ice cream and the caramel sauce.
4
Love the dessert , is very nice . Service is good too. If you love dessert this can be a place to drop by. Singapore had lot of dessert plc this is one of them that i will recommend .
5
We had a capuccino and a hot chocolate. We were surprised to see that the price was better than in Starbucks, and same was the taste!!! Awesome placeto hang out; comfy sofas and background jazz music
5
Very delicious chocolate croissant, Japanese way. They have a breakfast set at 5sgd with one coffee/tea + chococro which is very worth it !
4
Basement of Raffles City at City Hall MRT, this nice cfae has variety of desserts and snacks and drinks. That includes Vietnamese coffee. Can be crowded. A good place for a quick snack or dessert while people watching at the busy mall.
4
One of my favourites ! Didn't realise that it's my second the this week. It's a day after another but more importantly, this is an awesome place for desserts n their special green tea coffee.
4
If you like croissant, ice cream, bananas and chocolate, you won't go wrong with this. They have free flow of plain water so that's a plus. Value was alright but be prepared to spend at least $5 for a drink and $7 for waffles. Service and ambience was above average.
