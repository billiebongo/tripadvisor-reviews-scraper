Wow! this is a must place to visit before sundown to the first light show over looking the harbour!! Highest spot in Singapore. It's a must..
5
This place has one of the best rooftop views of the city, if not the best. Make sure to check the weather forecast before you head there, they close the rooftop in case rain is expected.
4
Excellent views and good music however drinks are super expensive and not as strong so not a place I'd go back to but definitely worth experiencing on a special occasion. Long lines to get in so get there early.
5
Amazing music, great ambience and best location. Drinks are little expensive but food options are very good.
4
This place gives you the best view of Singapore. Try going in the evening around twilight to enjoy the before dark and after dark experience. Drinks are ordinary
3
Taken here by my daughter who works in Singapore. It's the tallest building in Singapore with a bar. 360degrees view across City, harbour and beyond. The sunsets on a clear night are excellent. Great place to meet if with lots of friends or the Company are paying!! If not pay for your very very expensive drink, lift experience, photo & sunset then head for somewhere more reasonably priced
4
We visited the bar at 1-Altitude on a Sunday night and timed it so we were up there for sunset (the 6pm-9pm ticket). The views are incredible, and as someone who isn't very keen on heights I still felt very safe - even though it was quite windy! With your ticket you get one drink, we had Singapore Slings which were nice although having had another one elsewhere it was quite sweet. We just viewed it as a free drink with the ticket price being for the views though!We thought there might be a time restriction on how long you could be up there but it didn't seem as though anyone was monitoring that.All in all, a great vantage point to see for miles and an enjoyable way to spend an hour or so on our short stop in Singapore
5
I had been to One Altitude few times before that even , however this time was different. A friend hooked us up with guest entry so we didn't have to pay the cover charges. Upon reaching the top, my friends from India were truly amazed with the Sun just about to set and the city lights about to be switched on. They had never seen a better roof top bar with such stunning view. All in all, my guests were happy. Plus the beers, food and live music didn't disappoint us either
4
We visited on a Saturday night and found the atmosphere to be a little less exciting than we were expecting. HOWEVER the view was incredible and we had no trouble getting a space at the viewing corner over the Bay.We paid $70 for two tickets up to the roof. Included in that was a "premium" drink. They had a few wine, cocktail, spirit options but as it was our anniversary we decided on champagne.Overall we had a lovely time up there and would recommend for anyone to visit while in Singapore
4
Being on the tallest terrace in Singapore gives a very interesting perspective from the regular views from slightly lower levels. The place is nice but sometimes it is a little too impersonal. Some staff is not too friendly as you have to find a place to sit by yourself and bringing your drinks from a central bar in a lower level. Not what i expected but the view compensated a little this situation
4
Amazing experience and must visit when you are in Singapore !! good staff and good music. Great view from the top.
5
Great views, good and efficient staff, very trendy, good music.
Perfect if you like this type of rooftop bar.
You are actually higher than the Marina Bay rooftop places, so you can look down on them!
2
Fantastic location together with the view. Bit difficult to get a drinks from bar as bartenders are not helpful unless you book a table spent lot of money than only you get service. Rest amazing experience thrilling view
5
Located on level 62, Altitude is the tallest roof top bar in Singapore. The view is simply stunning, offering a 360 perspective of the whole city state. Admission is free with a purchase of a drink or two. Definitely worth it!
5
The breathtaking view from 1-Altitude of Singapore is one that is memorable and I recommend it for both locals and tourists.
There is also a good selection of beverages from the bar.
5
Great experience to be at 1 altitude. I usually go with my friends there and its always been awesome experience
4
This rooftop bar has the most spectacular views (360 degrees) of Singapore from the rooftop of one of the tallest buildings in downtown Singapore. The wait in the queue at ground floor is a real pain, but the wait is worth it just to see the scenery. How are the drinks? Nothing special and pricey
4
The highest located bar in Singapore. Ideal time to visit is just before sunset, dusk, with the night lights of Singapore get switched-on. Enjoy this view while sipping a drink among friends. They also have a live-band playing on some days. Great place with a View.
5
Perfect couple of hours spent on the gallery. Yes the place could do with a little makeover (to be honest after night fall it makes no difference), yes the lounge music is a bit loud (we enjoyed it) and the drinks arenâ€™t cheap (where are they cheap in Singapore) but what a stunning view to take in, sun coming down drinking champagne waiting for the city to light up.Spot on
5
Before i visited 1 Altitude, I never thought the night sky view from top of singapore can be comparable with HK. The view from HK top roof said to worth a million. But 1 Altitude changed my mind - Singapore seems to be very peaceful and beautiful with a 'loud' background of music. you will immediately feel being in a movie and yourself a star. All staff are very friendly, the only drawback i would say is, maybe this is to any Singaporean bar is, the alcohol are relatively expensive compare other cities in Asia
3
This place is great for the view, however, the decor is simple and lack ambience and it is not value for money.
5
We went up just before 9pm (when the price rises) and all thought it was the best 30SKD we had spent! Music was great, brilliant atmosphere and the views were absolutely incredible.
2
We had to commit to buying one-drink (S$35) or two-drinks (S$45)before gaining access. Beer was a bottle. Alcohol was barely a shot. The place was empty at about midnight when we arrived. Friendly people. Nice views.
2
I believe the view will be more stunning at night.
Care not for the food and layout.
Place in need of renovation. Quite dilapidated
5
Well one of the must visit place in Singapore if you want to see the city from the top. 2 options for entry 35 SG$ and 45 SG$ , you get the drink options with the mixer , well organised , good music if in a group you will enjoy every money spent and not that expensive as well
3
First of all, the place is indeed really worth visiting. The view is just breathtaking, and when you can enjoy it with a cold Tiger it gets even better. ...but why the heck do they need to turn up the volume in the right-next-to-your-ear-whereever-you-are speakers to a volume that makes it impossible to have a normal conversation, at 19:30 a Sunday evening?? Iâ€™m used to nightclubs and even restaurants with loud music, but this was to the next level. Very annoying, and we left the place after just a couple of drinks. But apart from this - the place is amazing
5
You pay an entry fee of around 28 dollars to enter and get a free drink as you get to the top. You can view the whole city from the top, absolutely amazing.Funky tunes and friendly staff added greatly to the experience.The food offering was top notch too.Try and get there before sunset and watch the city transform from day to night.Gets busy from 21:00.A must visit when in Singapore.
5
Really - the highest place in Singapore. Go there for an evening drink and relax. Don't miss if the skies are clear, and don't go if it is cloudy or rainy. You can actually see MBS well below you and view anywhere from Malaysia to Indonesia.
3
I can't imagine there are better views of Singapore. 360 degrees from the tallest building. If you want to see all of Singapore from one spot, this is it. But, the entry feels like you are entering a 2nd tier nightclub. Bouncers and staff are unprofessional and distracted. Getting to the elevator and onto the roof takes you through some dank and dirty rooms with peeling paint and decor. It didn't feel like the $32 cover charge was well spent (until you see the view). You are paying $32 to avoid the tourist crowd, nothing more. The service is pretty average
4
From Wednesday to Saturday the evening starts with a DJ spinning some sunset vibes. Later on, typically a band is playing with a DJ on duty during the band breaks. Prices are stiff, though Singapore is not known for its cheap drinks anyway. Still a cool place to visit and take in 360 views of the city
3
Drinks are overpriced and the skydeck is mostly overcrowded. Not a bad experience, cute color changing tables and the deck is smoker friendly. View is ok at best, worth a few selfies.
4
If you're looking to spend a high time in singapore, you've got to come to 1-Altitude. Even though the prices are pretty high too, the ambience and food is worth it!
2
Manage your expectations ! Nice view and all that, but unpersuasive drinks and our waiter was super average (male). I wouldn’t make the effort again...
4
The rooftop bar is really good. The skyline is visible. A lovely view. The rooftop bar is better than the club. Good crowd.
4
I work just below the office so everytime when there is a visitor we will bring him/her or them to the bar. It is by far one of the best bar with the best view. None of the other bar has such stunning 360 view of the major parts of Singapore. It is really one of the best place to show tourist and wow them. However, the price to get up goes up and up and up. It is now $35 (previously $25 then $30) for the entrance fee inclusive of a drink. Well, I guess majority of the money goes to the entrance fee because really, how much can a drink cost? Anyway, it is a must go for anyone who have not been up there
3
I probably not have the best pictures of the 360 degree view of Singapore city from 62nd floor roof top at a height if 232m but would like to share my experience. Passionate about exploring the rooftop bars at different places, I had two options in Singapore to choose from Marina Bay rooftop and Altitude 1, consulting with the locals I chose Altitude one over Marina bay. Access to the bar cost you an entry of 30 SGD which includes a choice of an alcoholic drink(I liked the options), since I was using Amex, I got a complimentary drink from their in-house downpour. I reached the top, placed an order for my drink and started to take a look around. I must say I wasn’t really impressed much with the view (after Bangkok’s sky scrapers) and but for the first timers, it must offer the joy of a sky scrapers. The drinks and music were nice and the staff was also good. I would recommend this over Marina Bay anytime since it has a 360 degree view and height gives an advantage to the view, which Marina Bay might not be able to offer. So cheers and enjoy yourself

We were taking our friends who had come in from Australia and U.K to see the skyline of Singapore. At the entrance downstairs we were informed that the charge would be $45 per person with 2 drinks. We paid for the entrance fees for 4 pax. Then came the shocker - we had to choose our drinks from an extremely limited menu ( beers, 2 cocktails ) and we had to place our orders downstairs. So, one of us chose a beer and the other 3 chose a martini. We were then told we had to choose both our drinks downstairs. No, we couldn't go up and choose the second drink. No, we weren't allowed to change or order if we didn't like the drinks. The tourists were aghast at this ridiculous behaviour. We asked repeatedly but were told no, you cannot change your drink and you must order both the drinks now. Unbelievable. I"m paying for those drinks. This is the last time I will ever take my guests to this establishment. A captive market doesn't mean you treat your customers with such hostility. We were all really annoyed but didn't want to ruin the night. We went upstairs and the views were wonderful. The cocktails were fairly good but this high handed behaviour had dampened our moods. We stayed for an hour to take pictures and left. Never again ! This was a rip off
5
The view from here is fantastic, especially on a clear night seeing the whole city lit up, definitely worth a look. great place to chill and view from the bar is absolutely awesome. One of the best views of Singapore to be had. Went there with a group of friends and we had a great time listening to their band
4
This place is amazing. If you are happy to pay the cover charge ($35SGD) it is worth a look. The views are spectacular. Finding seating/tables is challenging and the drinks are $$$ ($95SGD for 2x double shot Grey Goose/Coke). Can take a while to get drinks though. The music was great while we were there.
3
1 Altitude is nice for a stunning 360 view of Singapore. I normally stay less than an hour there and just have one drink. The service could be better, the seats should be more comfortable and a fan might help a bit - keep in mind that humidity is 80% plus. You should go there to make some awesome pictures and get an impression about how big Singapore is. Not for more, not for less
5
Very beautiful place, had been there with my friends and i would love to go back there. Have good options of drinks and very attractive drinks
4
Amazing views and great location. Very trendy bar with prices to match. Would recommend a visit, just be ready to pay and service speeds could be improved.
4
Bought my friends who were in town up. They thought a nearby place was good. There were shock to see the 360 degree !! Entrance fees is S$25.00 , which includes a soft drink. A gem place that one must go.
5
Great views and great sundowner music set by DJ Lindo Martinez.Drinks are expensive and cocktails are weak but worth buying a bottle and enjoy the music and view.
4
Altitude is a nice place to hang out and enjoy the great view of Singapore's Marina Bay. We can here with 30 or so colleagues and enjoyed the casual atmosphere and buffet foods. The food itself was ok - but the view up at 61 floors is fantastic. Prices are pretty expensive but for a business function this should be acceptable. Would recommend
4
Yep, that's where you are, almost literally, the moment you hit that 63rd level! With terrific, panoramic views of "sunny" (or moony) Singapore all around, and the classy Marina Bay below, you're well protected atop your high perch by a glass barrier all around, and so can't really "stick your neck" out for a better view below! And don't even try to "climb" atop the seats for that "perfect pic" from above the top of the glass pane, as you'll have security all around you before you can even utter "altitude"! That's what happened to me when I tried!Great grub and drinks, accompanied by the sound of music that rises in tempo as the night (and boozy yapping) wear on ... and most definitely one of the venues you want to take in on your "city-in-the-garden" visit ... 
3
I visited it a few times as a part of a conference nigh out or with friends visiting Singapore. Well, always full of people. I wouldn't recommend eating there. The maximum - grab a drink and enjoy the view + photos. At the same time, there are better places in Singapore with a similar view and not so overcrowded
5
This incredible bar is the highest alfresco bar in the world. It's a staggering 282 metres up & the view is completely worth it! Wednesday night is ladies night so if you're female you'll get to cut the queue, there's no entry fee & $10 selected martinis!
5
we had tons of fun and staff are very well educated.it was pack and the view drop our jaw.we had mojito but its seems it was pre-mix and standard of taste was not to our expectations and we just ordered beer.music of their dj was hype and decided to join the crowd to move and dance.we will definitely be back again
5
Most of the reviews here refer to the evening at Altitude. The terrace is also open in the day with an entrance of SGD 25, which includes a soft drink. The views are spectacular, allowing a 360 degree vista of the complete island. Altitude supply ambassadors to make your trip useful as they have tips on places to visit. Well worth the money
4
If you like music this might be a good place to party with a view! taking the lift up to the roof top, hang around with friends seeping away on the drinks enjoying the 360 degrees night view!
5
Very cool and elegant place. I was excited to visit there. I think that after this I will often go here!
3
It was a great view and atmosphere was pretty ok. Plastic glasses for drinks were really off. The food and Beverage were not value for money and service was bad and pretentious.
5
Super duper time to spend with clear 360° view of Singapore , the drinks are great and value for the good time you enjoy
4
was on a weekend evening before 10 pm, caught me in surprise that the services staff on the floor performed better then i expected but the entrance staff need more patients and diligence over customers, will recommend to oversea friend if they want a place above all (highest) for a night view over Singapore landscape.
4
Big fan of 1-Altitude from here you can overlook the MBS, and if weather permits the sunset is to die for. It's less popular than MBS as the area is in the main CBD area another reason could be the high window shield that look somewhat unsightly. I would recommend if you are a batch of girls to go on Wednesday night where you could get free entry, try to arrive before 6.30 to get a seat as well as to capture the sunset.
3
The view from here is fantastic, especially on a clear night seeing the whole city lit up, definitely worth a look.Unfortunately that's the only point justifying the three stars. Arrogant staff and obscene pricing is a massive negative. $10 for a small glass of draft Sprite, not even a can, or $22 for Heineken or pre-made cocktails leave a terrible taste after staff snap money out of your hand and walk off without even a thank-you.Also consider if you book a table, you will spend most of the time with people leaning over you taking photos of the view, or asking can they sit in your seats, hardly a relaxing evening.Go for the view, but keep your money in your pocket
5
Altitude Rooftop Bar in Singapore is on the 63 floor!!!! It has the MOST incredible views of the Quay and all of Singapore!!!! I was there the weekend of the Grand Prix Singapore so it was very lively and tons of FUN!!! The drinks were good and the views were fantastic!!! The dance floor was hopping and the general atmosphere was a great experience!!!! I highly suggest it!!!! :
1
Ok lets do the good. It's the view its the only reason to go here. Beyond that the place is even by Singapore prices a monumental ripoff $45.00 gets you in with 2 drinks thats the only way you can go here by paying before you get into the lift. After that they may choose to close it down due to weather even if its clear skies. and send you to their horrible bar below. The service is horrible, the staff spend more time looking at Facebook than trying to help you or making your drink order.In short there are plenty of other bars with real service and the same view. DON'T BOTHE
3
The bar is on the above of 62th floor of One Raffles building. Conviniently reachable by MRT Raffles station. Paid SGD 30 for a drink to get to the bar which is not too bad. Stunning skyview indeed but the wine (red) wasn't good - well to be fair the wine pref is totally subjective but if go again, I would choose something else. Sunmary: Average drink with Stunning View The view: 9/10 The drink: 7/10
5
Breathtaking views, great atmosphere, expensive drinks but definitely worth it as a one off at least! Most tables were booked or reserved so you should book in advance if there's a group of you!
4
Service was good, choice of drinks was fine, view was great, worth checking this place out of your in Singapore
4
Great ambience ! Amazing view ! Awesome food & drinks ! A place not to be missed the view is what it makes the overall experience great !
5
Great place for tourist and locals alike, fantastic view, great drinks, good vibes, excellent outfitted bar, cannot be missed
4
Great view of the city skyline. Drinks are ok and service can be more friendly but the view is what it makes the overall experience great.
4
had a wonderful time, lovely music and ambiance. enjoyed food and drinks and everything about this place was so magical
5
After a long day of roaming Singapore, we wanted to have a nice dinner meal while listening to some clubbing music. We heard a lot about 1-Altitude bar and marked it on our To-Do list. First of all, when we got up to the bar, we were stunned by the amazing view of Singapore and it was a surprise to find out that this tower is higher than Marina Bay Sands hotel. The DJ was epic and played awesome music. We ordered pizzas and fries & they were very well done and tasted fantastic. The drinks were great and we stayed there as long as we can while enjoying this mesmerizing view of Singapore and it was a night to remember. We would come back for sure when we visit Singapore again
5
I great place to chill and view from the bar is absolutely awesome. One of the best views of Singapore to be had. Went there with a group of friends and we had a great time listening to their band. They played a range of music from 70s to some of the later hits. The lower deck gives one ample opportunity to dance if you so desire. All in all it was such a relaxing, fun-filled night.
5
Sooo ok it was my birthday but holy cow this place is literally on top of the world . Our ears popped on the way sky high in the elevator and once you're up there the view is breathtaking scarey and breathtaking.... cocktails are expensive and you pay for your drink on the ground floor entrance with your entrance price .. worth every cent by the way. I've heard you need to book a table 30 days in advance and pay a deposit ( also standing tables are available) but in true Aussie fashion we sat at a table drinking cocktails for nearly 2 hours before the booking arrived AWESOME
5
Looking to chill out at a roof top bar with amazing night views of Singapore's skyline? This is the place!Occasionally, there will be different private events held. Entry fee might be a bit expensive, but hey, you get a 360 degree view of the island.
5
As one of the highest building in Singapore, One Altitude gives a panoramic view of CBD. Try and reach about 1 hr before sunset and enjoy spectacular views before and after sunset.
5
Nice place to hang out with friends....... service and good are great......
will definitely return with friends. thumbs up... Cozy ambiance and clean for sure.
5
It's obvious, you have to look down on the Marina bay sands from this bar, it's absolutely gorgeous. Enjoy a little expenses for an unforgettable experience on the Altitude Skybar.
4
A good place to chill out. Nice roof top bar with a great view of Singapore Skyline.
We will be back again.
3
It does have a great view but overall it is overpriced .The entry fee gets you one "free " drink but for me it was not good value . Quite a long line to get in at the weekends
4
Took the trip to the viewing gallery by day, so bar etc not open.
Fantastic views of the entire Singapore island, well worth a visit.
4
Thanks, Raymond!
We had a great time at 1altitude last Friday!
THe view as usual spectacular!
W will be back!
3
Headed there for fireworks for Singapore's birthday. Able to see both sides of the city state. The livelier and the tranquility side. An alternate choice from Ion sky.
5
Pretty expensive though. But a good place to hang around with friends, especially on weekends and public holidays.
5
My first visit to what is dubbed the "highest alfresco bar in the world". You pay a $30 cover charge ( $35 after 9 pm) at the ground level and also order your drink there before being whisked up 2 elevators to the roof gallery which has unobstructed 360 degree views of Singapore. Perhaps best to go around 6.30, while it's still light, and stay on through dusk, and then darkness, to see the city lit up brilliantly. Service is prompt, second drinks cost an exorbitant $20/- a pop, so perhaps best to nurse your first drink and then go down to nearby Boat Quay if you want more drinks and food.The $30 cover charge may seem a lot but think of it as $20 for the view ( same amount you pay to go up to the Skypark @ Marina Bay Sands, where there are milling crowds) and $10 for the drink which is par for the course. Definitely a must for all visitors, and locals like me
5
Great place to hangout with friends. Full of crowd. Not recommended for peace loving people. Food and drinks are good enough.
4
This is a good venue to show your overseas visitors, but the prices are quite steep and it is also difficult to have a conversation unless you are standing or sitting very close.
5
Highest Alfresco bar in the world with some amazing bar & food menu. Love going to this place while sunset. Place definitely brights up the evening. Live music is fun and Service staff is so helpful.
5
Breathtaking view combined with excellent music and good cocktails ... well there's nothing more you can ask for
Sunset in this place has the best picture you can take of singapore skyline
Mostly recommend!!!

I recently went with my friends to One altitude only to be caught by surprise and shock that the major part is under renovation of which we were not informed at the entry. When we enquired about the differential rates for the club, we were only told that it was due to limited access to viewing gallery and the other for the disc, but nowhere we were made to understand the difference vis-a-vis regular days when there was single ticket to the club. Additionally the viewing gallery now has all the seating, DJ and bar, which means the place is jammed and you can barely walk without bumping into another group. Music was pathetic since the fun was all lost with music escaping thru open walls.

Dear sirs,I was the guest in your rooftop bar and I have faced your bar and restaurant experience I ever met in my life. We came here with 8 paxs of people bought your ticket 180m SGD and spend with you more than 900 SGD. Maybe we are just not spent enough to get the better or best services you provided. Let me tell you what experience we got from your best roof top bar in SG. when we arrive, the credit card machine was broken. do you think all tourists will get cash in cashless society country like SG > luckily we had enough cash to pay. when we arrived your rooftop, we asked to get 8 paxs table but all reservation. we understood and ask your staff to get us best solutions. And we got 1 table that already reserved. then they asked us to move to another table cos this table the guests will come at 10.00 PM, it's fine. And another staff came to my table said "You can not sit on this table as it's reserved" So, i told him to talk to another staff who told me we can sit on this table, then come to tell us again where we can sit. Luckily 1 of your staffs brought me the big table and we thanks them with tips about 30 SGD as a fully thank you for his effortAnd later on, your staff told me it's going to rain and we can move to 62th floor, and provide us table which we will stay for long and happy with all of my paxs. then, suddenly another staff came to my table and told us this table was reserved and fed us away like a dog "please see this work DOG" and bring stuffs from other tables to our table. which my credit card was not clear yet. this is very impression experience we got from your roof top bar with spending more than 1,000 USD within 3 hours where we can spend more but your staffs just fled us away like dog. even I want to sign credit card, they ask me walking thru the crowd to sign my credit card at your check out counter "service charge applied" Oh wonderful !!!!!!Thanks for the best experience ever!!Jiravat P

Like the kitchen was overworked? Soup was thick enough to put up wallpaper. Several dishes really tasted unfinished.Was supposed to be a romantic evening in one of the highest restaurants in the city, with prices to match but found a bunch of raucous after seminar people blowing off steam.These guys should decide whether they're a low light romantic restaurant or an office canteen. With the quality of food offered, I see no reason for a return visit
5
My husband and I had booked to go to 1 altitude on a Tuesday and were greeted by Sammy the host for 1 altitude. From the moment we arrived he looked after us and ensured that we had the best experience. Unfortunately, the first night we were booked to go there was a thunderstorm warning so we were not able to go up to the roof top bar but he took us downstairs in the bar area and we had our own private booth with champagne and nibbles. He advised us to come back the next day, and we are so happy we did. We were taken up to the rooftop bar and had a great seating space overlooking the whole of Singapore. We had champagne and food and throughout the whole night, Sammy and his staff were on hand to ensure that all our needs were met. Going to 1 altitude is a must for any group of people or couple and the experience was one we will never forget. Thank you Sammy and your team for making the end of our honeymoon one to remember. It really made our trip to Singapore
1
Only thing good about this place was the view (the view is amazing). The drinks were bad...my cocktail was warm and gross. The food (satay) was greasy. The servers were nice but extremely slow and inefficient I don't think you could pay us to come back here. The bar was trying so hard to be cool but failed miserably. Very disappointed in everything but the view! Plus...Wednesday is "ladies night" so ladies can go up for free
3
Came for business luncheon. Ambience was dated, service raw. We ordered the 3 and 4 course set lunches comprising foie gras, chicken soup, beef cheek & cheese platter.Everything was just average. Foie gras appeared burnt & did not have that crispy edge finishing, chicken soup was bland, beef cheek undersalted, cheese platter came with miserable raisins & tired celery sticks. Warm walnut bread was best
4
One of the best place to view the city in 360 degrees. One of the highest Al fresco bar in singapore. Great view and great bar!
4
The rooftop area was under renovation when we visited . I would definitely like to return for a drink at sunset when the renovations are complete
5
View was amazing, check the weather before heading over as it's open air. The place is right above Raffles Place MRT station, convenient for those taking public transport :)
5
Good view of the city skyline from one of the tallest buildings in singapore and with good ambience. Nice crowd to mingle with too. Situated at the heart of Singapore's business district.
5
What a view! Panoramic 360 view of the city. Must go for a drink, probably only one as they are expensive as they are in every roof top bar.
4
This place has nice ambience with beautiful scenery. Good selection of beverages, cocktail and wine.
5
Right at the top of the business district to watch the sunset and subsequent light up. View is nice and you can go to the next level for dinner later.
5
The night views here is really amazing. But be prepared for drinks prices that reflect the "cost of view"!
4
Very nice rooftop bar with 360 view of the whole town. Prices are fair as they are normally very steep in such establishment.
4
Would love to go back and see the place finished. We were there quite early in the evening but most of the tables were empty and reserved for later. Stayed for 2 drinks and admired the view. Would be interesting to see the view in daylight as it was pretty remarkable at night. Worth going to for a drink but would not plan your whole night to be there.
4
A good place to have a cold chill beer while watching the sunset and Singapore's awesome scenery with friends and business associates.
4
Love the view and the atmosphere! A good place to chill and relax which not to be missed with either your friends or your loved ones !
5
Awesome view, staff are super friendly and went over and beyond to get me a slice of cake even though they don't have it. Food is good.
5
Rooftop bar, great overview of Singapore CBD. Excellent band & pretty singer! A place to chill & relax
5
beautiful scenary and great companion hang out. at just one stop, you get to view the highlights of Singapore evening to night view.
4
Cool place to have a drink or two and the view is magnificent. Food-wise, isn't that great, so make sure you have your meal before that.
4
Good place to hangout with bunch of friends or get to know new friends. Standing on the highest floor just to admire the beautiful city its a must see thing. Making a reservation to avoid disappointments :-)
4
Be at the top of the nightlife scene and experience the scenic view of the Singapore skyline. Great place for dates, party, and drinks.
5
Breathtaking view, ambience and wonderful atmosphere from one of the tallest buildings in Singapore. A must visit for all party lovers

1Altitude Roof-top Bar in Singapore is a superb place to chill and dance to the loveliest and latest world lounge music. We went around 12 midnight and stayed till 2 AM. its was a lovely experience. A perfect hangout to drink and dance. The view from the top is amazing. Marina Bay Sands looks beautiful and gorgeous. We took so many pictures. The gallery is split over 3 floors with a superb view of Singapore from the top. The entire city looks lovely. Its a must visit for every tourist in Singapore. If one has anybody staying there then she/he is lucky.We enjoyed so much that we want to come back again soon

This is very interesting and wonderful place for relax or party on your vacation or special moment for your life,
they a lot of activities for us to have a wonderful time with Gallery & Bar at 1-Attitude
5
The chef is amazing food was fantastic great atmosphere amazing views, great music A Singapore must see.
5
Romantic environment, great city view, excellent services, enjoy the night here, must go place in Singapore.
5
The highest point in Singapore to grab a drink. Enjoy the fluctuations in your mobile network each time a cloud passes over your head.
4
First time in Singapore, you must went there! 35$ to go upstairs with a drink but worth it! Good music and staff!!
5
The bar is at the top of the office building and the entrance is uniquely located beside the main lobby. You can find it almost instantly. No air conditioning there; only the naturale air. But there are outdoor smoking so you would probably get some of the good second hand smoke. Great view, great vantage point to see how Singapore is like
5
Around last week of April I visited again 1 Altitude with my friends. It was Wednesday thus we enjoyed a free entrance (ladies night). Everytime I visit this place, it always feels like it's the first time. Amazing view and great place to unwind. Unfortunately it rained that night, we were then transferred to their indoor bar, which was also nice. DJ was good, crowd was fantastic. Kudos to the staff of 1 Altitude for the systematic way of handling the crowd when it rained
4
The atmosphere and view were great but the music is not so happening. It is a nice place to hangout especially for first timer in Singapore, get to see the whole city from the top. With the cover charge of $35 (not cheap with exchange rate for some countries), you will get a glass of drink ranges from cocktails to wines. Still worth a visit.. :
5
TBH We expected bad service, expensive drinks and perhaps a bit of a tourist trap.No, the drinks are not cheap but not expensive for the location either.And you can actually have a great night out- not just a drink to take in the view and leave.The club is cool and you can leisurely, more quietly, have a drink too.I'll go again when I am in SG
3
1-altitude is definitely the best place to see a large view of Singapore. You can enjoy your drink in a nice place. But, it's totally wasted by the music. Indeed, we expect a lounge music for the early evening and then a dance/club music for the night. The music is inaudible. I'll recommend the 1-altitude because of the amazing view, but the experience could be really better!
5
Nice place to have drinks and bites in evening with great views of SG skyline. Good service and quality food. But the prices are a bit expensive which is justified by location and ambiance,
4
NICE PLACE, REASONABLE PRICE but over crowned. there is no shelter if rain so bring your own umbrella. :)
5
You can enjoy brand-new circumstances and dramatic beautiful night view. Also I recommend pulleton(?) bay hotel roof top bar. but if you visit Singapore, here is my no.1 recommend hip place
4
The bar have a wonderful view of Singapore City View from the high point. You can see the merchant ships and city view from the top. Awesome experience. Will definitely come again.
3
I did not find this place so good , maybe it is because the Price is too high comparing with what you get.
5
The best ever rooftop bar to chill out with great ambience, nice view, friendly staff & superb music..incredibly awesome! My all time favourite place!
5
this is one of the best rooftop bar's in singapore. A must visit place for drink & music lovers......
5
After your wedding ,it's great to hand around this place and party with your friends here after a day workout ,lol.
5
I have been here a few times now and will bring back out of town guests to showcase Singapore's highest bar. The drinks aren't cheap but you can an okay bottle of wine without breaking the bank. There are also snacks but this really is more a place to chill and have a few drinks with friends. Warning if it's raining or there is potential for a storm, they will shut it until the threat passes. Just keep in mind if you want to go and the weather is looking murky
5
I've been to 1-Altitude around a dozen times I guess, but I never tire of the views, the ambience, the breeze, the vibe and the music. The female singer with the band that's been there for a while on Wednesdays now is superb; she has a fantastic voice! (They might be there other evenings, it's just by coincidence I have seen them on a few Wednesdays now). There are some reviews that criticise the place for being over priced, and a bit pretentious, but I disagree. It's a special place. The staff are always nearby to replenish drinks, the snacks are good, and it's always a crowd pleaser when we have guests in Singapore. I would like to see a better draught beer selection, and I guarantee if there was more seating on the upper deck, people would stay a lot longer! They could maybe employ a top class mixologist too. But that aside, these points don't deter me from returning. It is that little bit unique. And you are on top of the world!
3
There are a few obvious thing - more foreigners/tourist than locals. More hands on cameras than drinks. It is definitely the place for a view. But more than that, it lacks character. Good place to bring visiting guest and round up the night.
5
offer city view of singapore! it's the best when you order one glass of drink, sit down and chill with your friends! the night view of singapore is fantastic. would definitely go again if there's a chance.
4
Had Lunch there once. Very nice view overlooking the city. Food was good but could be better given the price range. Will definitely visit again
4
They have recently increase their price but its still a good place to come and chill - especially in the evening. You can book in advance or just come straight to their door.
3
Definitely worth a visit and you do expect a beer to cost 20 after tax for the view. The staff are a bit up themselves and the seating is not all that comfortable. Make sure you book.
5
The river in Trang An was tranquil and very beautiful. The ride on a row boat was soothing. The many caves (or grottoes) the river passes through were fantastic. The whole river and the hills flanking it are breathtakingly beautiful.Eco Travels who arranged our trip did an excellent job
4
Went to the sky bar and paid a cover charge at the entry. 30$ per head. You have to select a drink at the bottom entry itself. They give a reciept, which you produce on the 62nd flr and ur drink is served there. After this process you can stand upstairs and get a standing table. We had booked a proper seated table for 8 people for a Fri night. Day before the event they called and told us that we would have to generate a bill of at least 1200$ to keep that table and pay upfront on thursday itself a deposit of $600. This was ridiculous and thats why the 4 stars, else the views etc wud get them 5*s anyways due to this upfront deposit scheme, we didnt go ahead. As I assume many others did not as well. So on the fri evening when we landed there, many tables were empty and we requested that we would like to occupy one. They said all were reserved and they would try. And we did get seated and did enjoy drinks, food and the great views. Overall we may have billed almost $1100, inc cover charges for 12 people. But the idea of a deposit which you lose if you dont show up, doesnt seem acceptable
2
Our expectations were not met at the Altitude. Expected higher quality on almost everything. Furniture, space, dance area. Looks and feels just cheap. Traveled a lot to Shanghai, and thought to find something like the M1NT or Bar Rouge. Or like the Luna Bar in KL. Only nice thing is the view - it is a personal decision if it is worth the amount of minimum spending to get up there.Cannot understand the hype for it..
4
We came here on Friday night because my friend really wanted to go. We paid the admission fee that gave us one free drink. The highlight of the evening was the live cover band they had -- really good music. We walked around the perimeter and I must say that the views were stunning. However, there is plexiglass that is smudged with lots of fingerprints bordering the terrace so it was hard to get good pictures of the view. The drinks were pretty average and the glasses didn't look clean. Then again, I think we paid for the view and not the quality of the drinks. Overall a 3.5 stars experience so I rounded up to 4. We left the place in less than a hour
5
We’ve been around 6pm on the entrance to the elevator. They told us, because of the weather conditions it’s not sure, if they will open the top deck. Nevertheless we decided to go up. We had to pay 30 SGD per person and had to choose a drink. Arrived on the 63. Floor we got our drink on the bar. The view here is also amazing, but you have to take pictures through the glass panels and also you don’t have a view to all sides. After one hour they told us the top deck is open now. So we went up to have a free 360 degree view without glass panels. To have a view to Singapore with different lights you should come before dusk and stay until total darkness
5
After 5 minutes at the top of OUB Centre, your head feels light from taking in all the sights of the Singapore financial district. Or it could have been due to that shot of vodka that you just downed.
5
amazing music and view however the snacks r really not that good i used to go there a lot because of the relaxing atmosphere
5
You can never go not amazed from this great place to chill with your friends and family members. Be prepared to be amazed at the view especially you go during sunset to night time. Enjoy :)
5
Pricey but well worth the visit. Spectacular view and good ambience. I would recommend anyone visiting singapore to spend a few hours in this bar.
4
I drank a Singapore Sling while watching Singapore's wonderful cityscape. And the night view was also the best and beautiful.
4
Amazing rooftop view of Singapore downtown and Marina Bay Sands area at night time, good drinking place for sure. definitely enjoy the time I was there! The price is high range, so prepare well your purse ^^
5
A great location for night time.
Superb view on Singapore city - especially Marina Bay - good music, nice people, and cool atmosphere.
Something special... recommended!
5
Drinks are expensive but you have to see this view... especially at night. It is well worth the price of admission (buy a drink).
5
We had a business meeting to celebrate the success of a project we launched and we were greeted with their polite hostess and was awed with a great view of Singapore's city view. We had access to this bar as we had our dinner at Stellar which is just one floor down. The ambiance was great, relaxing on the eyes while having a nice drink with peers. To set the expectations right, the pricing of their drinks is abit pricier than the bars on Clark Quay but if it is a group of people like friends or peers at work I say it evens out. This place is one of those things that you just got to go and try. I have to say I will definitely planning to go back but this time to chill with friends
4
On the very top of the OUB Centre you get the best view over the entire CBD and Marina Bay Sands. In fact you are so high up that you are actually looking down onto the MBS. Consider that this bar/viewing platform is very popular. Make sure you get your reservation and then enjoy the view
4
It's hard not to be impressed when you reach the highest bar in Singapore. Seats and tables were however cramped and food was really average, of the microwave variety. Go there only for the beautiful view and sunset.
5
Amazing views of Sg and good prices with a big selection of drinks and cocktails. Can stay inside or out depending on the weather.
3
Sure, it's a tall building and roof-top bar, but there are plenty of places that don't charge a premium for very mediocre drinks (think Level33 or other buildings). It's a decent place to send tourists for a good city view, but not worth the money.
5
Ladies, go on Wednesday to take advantage of the Lady's Night special. 10 SGD cocktails.
There is live music and a great view. It is left of the H&M in the Raffles One building.
4
Nice view (ofcourse!). Expensive (of course!) Very little shelter in case it rains. Go for the view - the food / drinks are not anything special.
4
Nice place. Right at the top of one of the tallest building in Singapore.
Be there before sunset and you can enjoy a spectacular view of Singapore. Remember to make a booking though.
1
Be careful when you pay, they double charged us. Not the first time this has happened.Music is so loud that you can't have conversations. So you just stand around drinking an overly expensive (double charged) drink. The view is nice though, but that's about it
4
This is a great place to visit to enjoy the view . You get a great view of Marina Bay Sands and the Singapore Harbour. If you go to the top of MBS, you don't actually see it. So I think this is a much better offering. Make sure you go on a clear evening.
4
High Floor, Nice place. Although a bit pricey but still worth the $$$ spend. Ladies, go on Wednesday to take advantage of the Lady's Night special. 10 SGD cocktails. There is live music and a great view. It is left of the H&M in the Raffles One building.Nice view (ofcourse!). Expensive (of course!) Very little shelter in case it rains. Go for the view - the food / drinks are not anything..
4
The view at the top is unparalleled, especially when having drinks at sunset. Come nightfall, the vibe of the place changes as the party animals come out to play. Loads of good looking people, models and their entourage, traders and bankers frequent this place. The music is loud, with different genres played on different days of the week.
5
Amazing, best service and perfect place to chill and relax after work with so much load of work and stuff
3
If you'e scared of heights 1-Altitude is not the bar for you! But if you like panoramic views, average drinks and music, and drinking outdoors, then this is the bar for you.
4
Great view of the city, service and internal logistics is nice. The thing that I don't like is that they play very commercial music from top charts.
5
Beautiful place for a drink. Not the cheapest place to have a drink but definitely a drink with a view!
Good for special occasions to talk and chillax.
3
Top of the building you can have 360 degrees view of Singapore. Great View !
Food and drink lists fantastic.
4
Unblocked view to see the whole Singapore. Have smoking and non-smoking zones. Very Breezy at night.
Definitely a must go place when you are in Singapore.
4
The highest bar in Singapore! Amazing views and breathtaking moments at sunset! Nice place well-taking care of you and your integrity at all times. Bar nothing spectacular but as any other one. Worth going!
3
We tried this restaurant at Dongmen station last week.We ordered Pan fried dumpling,steam dumpling and a gingeng chicken soup. We also wanted to order a vege but the manager was so kind and us, this is sufficient as the portion is enough for 2. The food is really good as the dumpling skin is really thin and melt in your mouth. The soup and vege is good too. Highly recommended
5
It was a beautiful idea to have a dinner at the 63rd floor and brought my family and a visiting old USA friend to spend an evening at 1-Altitude roof top bar.Taking the elevator up and down itself was a huge experience.This is the highest point among Singapore skyscrapers.Atmosphere is top class, with full wide view of Singapore cityscape. The MBS Skypark, Marina Singapore Flyers, Garden by The Bay, night streets....Sentosa Island, Container Ports..., and visibly at the far end are Indonesian islands and Malaysian mountains in Johor.Conveniently, pls use car park at the UOB plaza.Highly recommended
3
An amazing view but the service and slightly run-down feel of the building left the experience wanting. Had to wait a long time to order drinks which then arrived in plastic glasses. Food and drinks were below standard with above average price-tags. I had expected this because of the location but the quality was disappointing for the price. I would say that it is worth going once, just to say you have been, but I am not rushing to go back.
4
One of the more hip places to hang out after a hard day at work. Great atmosphere and good place to just relax
5
great view on whole singapore. nice and breezy if it is too hot down below. also nice cocktail selection
5
Great View Nice Food and great place to chill with friends and family.
Had a nice dinner with friends and family.
Place is surely recommendable and will be back again.
Love the view.
5
Out there amazing food
really has you thinking what next
Attention to detail
And a great service
It's a must if you visit Singapore
4
Nice chill place but might be too cramped at times. The music is nice and ambience of the place is great.
3
It's very high up. They have a good view of the city.I've been staring at this white box thinking of any other good things to say about this place, and I'm drawing up blank.Mostly, it was the people who were working there. Everyone just seemed so cold, and aloof, and arrogant. The only exception was the receptionist working at the first floor. But the rest of the staff just seemed so full of themselves. And not happy to be there.I know this is a club, and you don't exactly go there for the camaraderie, but still. Maybe it was just one night that I went? Anyway, the place seemed off
5
Proceeded to the open rooftop bar after dinner at the restaurant. It was a cool evening, with strong winds, as it has rained earlier. A bit of a pity that the outdoor seats were wet, and we couldn't sit to enjoy the lovely views. Still, it was a lovely way to end the evening with a lively band and gorgeous views over the city
4
Altitude definitely has the best views of Singapore. However, I don't think I'll be a regular as it's really rather expensive. Loads of security on hand to make sure some loser doesn't toss something down down to street level more than 60 storeys below.Nice ambience and music volume not excessive so you can actually have a conversation. If you have special guests visiting from overseas this is a nice place to go for drinks before dinner, say around 6pm. But the entry including one drink is $30 per person, plus an extra $5 if you want that drink to be Champagne.
3
Nice place to chill out though not certainly the best place for service a sit does get jammed packed as the night goes on. Drinks are priced very reasonably especially during happy hour hence the built up of crowd. Be careful of the weather though as the place will be closed if there's even the slighted drop of drizzle.
5
This place is my Favourite Hangout in Singapore.The bar is located at 63rd Floor of Raffles Place.The moment you are there,you see the mesmerizing view,.The view somehow is better then the marina bay visitor deck's View.its a open terrace. with lounge , sitting and bar.You may sit at the seats, enjoy your drinks and enjoy the view of singapore.Its a lovely view Post 8 PM of singapore.Place also has Great Music and Dance.Overall, its a perfect place for Drinks, food, Music and the atmosphere. !Dont miss on the weekends !
5
THis is a great bar to hang out in with friends or a date - amazing views, cool music, nice vibe lah
5
Great place with great services and reasonable price. Love the view and the crew is perfect. Recommended for all tourist that would love night view of Singapore and to chill out from a tiring day. :)
5
In singapore its a must visit place . The open club bar is on 63rd floor . From the top you can view Singapore . There is a charge of SGD 30 to enter and get a drink free on the top.
5
Just awesome great place mesmerising views...good food can go here again and again. ..the place is just a wow and would visit once again with friends soon
4
At least once you should go to this bar, the view is absolutely worth it. you might find a bit of a queue and that you have to pay a ridiculous amount of money for a bad cocktail.. but is singapore... you get used to it. but once you are up there and enjoy the view. preferable to convine it with a boat trip to get both angles
4
The rooftop bar is to die for; it's beautiful, amazing the vibe is just beautiful. The club underneath was also full of people but nothing beats the rooftop and the floor with the wooden dance floor in between. The music at all 3 places was different and each had its own style for different people. Would defiantly recommend this to anyone in Singapore looking for a good party and is in for a long time. However, we did not have any food since i think it was closed at late hours
2
Quite a few rooftop drink spots have appeared in Raffles Place. 1-Altitude is one of the earliest.But after going there a few times since its opening, have since given it up.The location is good, the service at the bar is decent, but the bouncers at the ground seems to think that everyone wants to come in for a freebie and treat all the guys like sneakers. I remembered once i had a vendor that was waiting for me at the rooftop bar with a bottle of champagne. I told the bouncers at the bottom and they just assumed i was a freeloader and made me paid the covers. The floor manager at the roof bar appeared embarrassed about it and told me.. it happens quite often. I have sworn off that place unless i have to go cos of reception events
4
I have been hearing about the view from the gallery at 1 Altitude since arriving in Singapore but nothing can really prepare you for the fantastic vista that presents itself from the roof gallery, it is simply stunning. The staff are friendly and helpful and although drinks aren't cheap they are reasonable for a venue of this caliber. It is a must for every adult visiting Singapore
4
Usually people take their friends to boat quay & Clarke quay, but I prefer taking them to 1-Altitude for atleast 1 drink. The cover Charge here is quite high ($35-40) on weekends (weekdays $28 upwards 6pm on) and really not worth that 1 free drink in dollar value - however the view and the time you'll spend clicking pictures and taking in the View more than makes up for the price. This is better than going to touristy MBS SkyPark!! Fun Fact (I think!) - topographically this is the highest point at 66 floors with an alfresco bar in Singapore compared to Swissotel's 73rd floor New Asia Bar Lounge. By that I mean from sea level!! Check on it though before boasting!The Band here on Fridays is good too. Best time to go is evenings to late night. A Pint of Beer (Tiger/Heineken - ugh!) is $22+ - darn
5
The Altitude has 360 degree views and a lovely ambience. Drinks are ofcourse expensive as you pay for the view. When it rains there is not place for shelter so you have to go down to the lower floor which is a bit crowded and completely closed off. Worth a trip but be prepared for an expensive night out.
4
Very snobbish service staff and waitress. If you are with a foreigner, you get treated better. Food and drinks are average and believe most people go there to be seen or otherwise for the view.
5
The rooftop bar is just insane. The view is priceless. The club, two floors down, is good. Just a good place.
5
I prefer this roof top bar than MBS. They have good DJs on the weekend, I usually come up here after happy hour on Fridays at Club Street.
5
I live in Singapore and love this bar to take family and friends when they visit. It has incredible views over the city and a great "city life" ambiance. It's always a great night out!
5
Great place to entertain friends and to wind-down from a hectic work-day. The view is excellent especially at night
5
Vice place if you're alone or with you're in the company. A good selection of drinks and very relaxing place.
5
Ok I hate heights so chose this over the Singapore Flyer. We were very happy we were the only people there and had plenty of time to view and talk with our host! The refreshing drink was lovely in the heat. Its $25 an adult but we felt that this was worthwhile. We visited about 12:30pm it would be great for a drink in the bar
5
With a breathtaking view, this is a great place to unwind and have a mini re-union or connect with friends. Great music, super view and good cocktails. Its a great combo. You ave to choose your drink along with the cover charge before you step into the elevator but you can buy more drinks at similar price at the bar as well.
4
Get a view of Singapore Skyline from here. Great service to chill out with Friends. Casual atmosphere, friendly staff, and a place to unwind too. Be there slightly earlier, as one might need to queue to go up to 1-Altitude. If you're a photographer enthusiast , bring a light gear ( a good one too ) and the skyline might be just some photos you would like to add to your collection. Else, enjoy , drink and take the public transporation as there are lots of Taxis and the MRT is just round the corner
4
This is one place to enjoy the views of Singapore city from high up. You actually look down at the "banana thingy" on top of MBS. Sip some champagne, hold hands with someone you love or even kiss. Once back down to earth level, life goes back to its humdrum state
4
Went to Gallery & Bar last month with friends when they visited to Singapore. Was first time there. Nice place to chill with and good view instead.
5
You can view SG from there, view is fantastic, a place not to be missed for chilling. During festive season, do book early.
3
Cant justify paying for the drinks here. The view is so so and the bar is pretty run down. Wouldnt recommend.
5
Amazing view and wonderful party place. Simply value for money for a place to have drinks after dinner.
5
Great experience with people from all around the world, great alcohol with premium views of the city. The place offers snacks and finger food but if you are really hungry then there's a great restaurant right underneath the bar.
5
Went to 1 Altittude with my girlfriend for her birthday drinks. I was served by Krishna and his service was impeccable. He was very patient with us even though we didn't know what to order. Furthermore, he made sure that all our request and needs are being met. Overall great service and great location with an awesome view
5
brought my wifey here for some drinks, food and the excellent views of course. we paid 30 sgd cover charge per pax ( gets 1 drink each ) at the ground floor. a lift takes us all the way up to 63rd floor. nice and comfortable set up at the top. the views of singapore and marina bay sands were breathtaking. if you like hanging out at rooftop bars / clubs, this place would not disappoint
3
Went there a few days ago with a friend. Had to pay 30 SG$ each to enter. 1 drink is included in the price. The view is amazing, the music was good. Decoration was nice. I had a good time here. Stayed for 2 hours. It is a nice place but due the high entrance price i will not come again
5
From this high vantage point, you could see the view of most of Singapore. We went there specially for the sun-downer. The view and music were truly impressive but couldn't say as much for the drinks choice that was on offer that came with the minimum cover charge, at SGD30 per pax. I regretted that I did not get the name of the band that was playing as they were really good. It would have been better if the band was on the same level as the viewing deck, then it would encourage people to also dance/sway to the music, which I suspected would enhance the romantic ambiance of the place, what with the sun setting in the background as well. All these nice settings however were somewhat marred by the management allowing kids below 18 years of age entry as it was not the right place for them
5
My boyfriend and I like a great rooftop bar and have visited many the world over. The 1Altitude is definitely one of the best we have been too. There is an entry fee of around â‚¬20 including a cocktail just to go up. I think Wednesdays ladies go free! :-) Drinks are expensive. But it is worth it. Just make sure you check out the weather forecast because if the lighting starts you have to go downstairs to an indoor bar. Which is quite frankly not worth the steep prices
5
A must visit place if you are in Singapore. Little expensive, but worth the money if you love heights. Try going late night to get an amazing view of Singapore.
5
The feeling of enjoying a chilled drink at the highest altitude in Singapore with a dazzling city beneath you can't be described in words...one has to be there and experience it.
5
The bar and gallery is the highest point in Singapore. Best view is at about 8 pm at night when all the buildings in the MBS area is lighted up.
5
The view is really great.Real selling point here. Nice bar. Drinks are pretty ok. There are some space for dancing. Good place to hang out as couples or with friends.
5
If weather permit (no rain or thunder) open air Bar give excellent view 360 panorama of Singapore.
The best time is Sunset Party (around 6 pm) and it is worth money spent for little bit expensive drinks there.
5
With a sublime view of Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia and great music it really is a unique place and absolute must for visitors.
5
The one altitude bar is a roof top bar at a very high floor, even higher than the Marina Bay Sands! You can definitely get the best 360 degree night view, the drinks are not expensive too. If you arrive at the bar around 8pm, you can even enjoy the laser show that shown from Marina Bay Sands.
4
I have visited this bar in a few occasions. I usually dropped by during weekday nights and i would expect a lot more crowd dewing Friday or Saturday nights.Based on my simple assessment, this is easily the maximum height we can go to among the Singapore sky scrapers. Give you a simple example, looking down at the world famous MBS skylark is like only half of the height.Music is loud, so probably more suitable for younger people. But for elder people, it is still good to spend an hour or two to just walk around the roof top bar, take good pictures of Singapore skyline and night lightings....on top of enjoying good drinks.A good recommendation to local and international visitors
4
The view, music and diversity in the club were great. All types of people in all types of dress. Huge fans keep everyone cool while dancing. The only real drawback is the price of the drinks. Although they are made very well a drink can be $30.Overall, however, it's a great place and I'll be going back.
4
Well worth the 30 dollar cover charge for amazing views of Singapore. It can be quite hazy but at night the city is lit up and looks fantastic. Three dollars cheaper than the Singapore Flyer and you get a drink and aren't limited for time. It's good value for the view but of course as with most things in the middle of Singapore it's very expensive but still, worth it for a once off so try and fit it in if you ca
5
This place is ideal on a cool, breezy clear night where it overlooks the city. The 360 degree view is breath taking and a must experience for visitors to Singapore
5
A view than none other. A panoramic 360 degree view of Singapore from the highest point, the 63rd floor of One Raffles Place. First see the view from Marina Bay Sands and then come here
4
The view is great, the music is entertaining. Our visitors and colleagues from overseas are always impressed by the place.
5
full 360 degree view of singapore. enjoy the breeze, drinks and music. mature crowd. almost full house even on weekdays.
4
Ladies can go during lady night which the cover charge will be waived. Worth a visit for the 360' view of Singapore, music is too loud though...Do expect a big crowd when the night falls...
5
Great place for party.over view the whole beautiful night sense of Singapore.Dance,drink and social among people.
4
This is one of my must-see spots for visitors to Singapore. I usually bring guests just before 7pm to watch the view change as the sun sets. It's also a great place to catch the laser show at the Marina Bay Sands.

I'd highly recommend this place if you are here as a tourist, or bringing friends from out of town. The bar offers a 360-degree view of the city. Its best to check it out in the evening around 7 right when the lights across the city come on. At night the music is loud and provides a great party atmosphere if that's your type of scene.
3
Expect to get water and very little booze in the drink you get with your entry to the top of this building. View is great, but nothing else makes you want to spend more than 15 minutes here. Bad cover bad and staff with an attitude make it a weird spot
3
Entry fees is needed. Suggest to on weekday to avoid crowded that the roof top bar area is not that big. It is a 360' to let you view the Singapore Night Scenery. Drink suggest you choose beer or cider is better rather than cocktail or wine is worst
4
Positive
* View is best: 360 degrees view of mighty Singapore
* Bar is nice and usual nice crowds is there
Negatives
* Difficult to talk (music is very loud everywhere)
* Drinks are expensive
* Queue is not enjoyable
* Place is packed
4
Expensive - but worth it for the view. I'm a bit beyond nightclubs and cocktail bars but had a work do here and it really is one of those places you are glad to have been.
5
DONT miss out this place when you travel singapore, Highly recommended to couple and tourist people. romantic place and value as well.
5
One of the must visit places in Singapore. High up in the sky, at the rooftop of 72 storeys, overlooking the entire cityscape Singapore, opposite the Marina Bay Sands hotel. Usual drinks and fingers foods.......free breeze and cool air.
5
Great time to spot and experience Singapore sunset 6.15 - 6.55pm! Seeing the sun setting into the west followed by city lights after 7pm lighting up across CBD with business associates was a great way to impress my partners.
5
If you want to impress your friends, local or overseas, or even your dates, bring them here and have a beer or champagne!
5
operating hour 6pm-to 3 am ,view was wonderful and romantic .local band on live .cocktail and other beverage ,snack
4
Best view in Singapore and over. Just have a drink and enjoy the 360 degree view over the city. Prize level is the same in this nature restaurants.
5
The view is awesome here. There can be a queue to get in, but when you go upstrais this is forgotten right away.
4
Located on the rooftop of OUB Centre, this al-fresco bar emits a cozy feeling with a great view of the surroundings. The lightings used is dim but not to the extent of dark, the seating arrangement is appropriate and you can opt for a seat just next to the glass barrier. Perfect place if you wish to get away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and for a place to just relax and chill!
4
Chic place to party the night away or chill over drinks, enjoying the air up there with best panoramic view of Singapore at sunset. Nothing else matters really.
4
One of the nice bar in singapore.It is in good location.Very pleasure for me.Taste are good and enjoyable.
5
Wonderful atmosphere although very busy. Fantastic views - what a great experience.
Well worth a visit
5
Especially before F1 it is great to enjoy a drink and the view. I always go there when I have guests and they all see this as a highlight.
5
A must do on a trip to Singapore. 360 degree views of the island and of course a great view of Marina Bay Sands. It's $30 entrance but you get a drink with this. Make sure to dress smart casual to be let in.
4
1 Altitude has amazing view and it is worth going during night time. Food is okay and expensive but drinks are good.
4
the title says it all. it's definitely a night club, not a place for a quiet drink. we went on a thursday night and there was a DJ, with loud EDM-style music, but totally fun and of course, the view iw amazing. definitely worth the admission price, which gives you one drink couponthey have bar food, pizza, satays, etc, which help soak up the late night alcoho
4
The Good:1. Best views of the city can be seen from here. Even the deck of Marina Bay Sands does not compare. Come by night for glittering views of the Bay area.2. The slightly high cover charge (SGD 35? if I'm not mistaken) is well-worth the views and ambiance you get here, along with the super-fast elevator ride up to the bar.3. Good, peppy music.The Not-so-good:1. Most of the seating is available only when reserved for in advance, and the reservation charges can be quite high for this, more so on eve of public holiday etc. In the first few years after its opening, there used to be absolutely NO seating whatsoever. Fortunately that changed and then there was ample seating around the whole bar. Now, however, most seating is reserved or simply unavailable, even if you land up very early, and this can be quite a pain...2. Early on, this bar used to feature live, jazz music on Sunday evenings when the crowds were also low. It used to be a simple, lovely, romantic setting. That seems to be gone now ... I hope the management can reinstate that
5
Great place for a drink with best views in Singapore! You will have to pay to go to level 62 but at last includes one drink.Spot full of beautiful people...and on Wednesday girls don't have to pay.Although expensive, you should give it a try
3
The attitude at ground floor service people lets you think you're scum of the earth. But once up there, the view is breattaking. It is however difficult to share with anybody, as the music after 10-11 pm is turned up so loud that it is impossible to hear
5
Very nice place you feel like you are top of the world, Also you can see Indonesia, Malaysia from this place.
5
A very cool place (because it is windy :)) with full view of the city scenery. Food are delicious and the nice are exotic. Though mainly alcoholic, one can still find non-alcoholic drinks there as well.
3
The view at 1-altitude is amazing so would definitely recommend it if you're here in Singapore visiting or you've never been.
Not recommended as a regular place to go. The staff pick who they like to be nice to. And the drinks are weak.
4
Great view naturally at the world's highest al fresco bar. We had a great time with good music though the drinks were a bit weak.
4
nice parties with one of the best views of Singapore. Their Mojito is famous and for a reason :) Its one of my fav places to go out in SG
4
Its a great place to have a 360 view of Singapore. Go there for a drink, good music, and enjoy Singapore beauty.
3
It's located at the highest building in Singapore ,but it's a bit let consideration for the crowded and what you have only the view and less attractive music /band ,small place make the crowd unpleasant,especially if you got a table then it's too near to each other's and lots of noise ,if you don't get a table (mostly mot) then you stand in the crowd ...room to improve
4
This is a place that I love to hangout and the rooftop vibe is always really relaxed. It's a hangout to entertain visitors, a girls night out or date night with hubby. Cocktails are excellent. The entrance fee is pricey but it comes with you free choice of wine. However, the need to select your drink while waiting inline is not sophisticated, a little tacky in fact because it feels like you are about to enter a very average pub. Anyway, the views are worth it and there always seems to be a perfect breeze which affords some fun dancing without getting too sweaty
4
Aside from being super pricey, 1-Altitude offers a great evening dinner and drink. We had a few small dishes which were all great, and a couple of drinks. Perhaps the only disappointing note is that the drinks all come in plastic "glasses"... Perhaps there's an explanation, but I personally would prefer glass given the atmosphere and what the price of each drink is. All in all though, a great evening and worth a visit
5
Recent visit to 1 the altitude just for the experience .Really lovely views across Singapore and far at night.if you need to sit down you r better of booking a table as most people just have to stand otherwise We spent a couple of hours just for the experience Worth a visit but not a must for a touris
5
If you want the perfect view of Singapore head up here around 6:30 to 7:00 any evening. The views are breathtaking. Maybe a little expensive however better value than may other advertised events.
5
It's fun to get high both physically and on drinks :P
YOu have an amazing view from the top of Level 63
4
Nice view of the Singapore skyline at night. Cover charge applies but covers you for the first drink. Be early if you want a place to sit.
5
Beautiful place to party and hang out with friends right in the middle of the city. Good music and selection of alcohol. If you are early enough, you will get a very good deal on happy hour drinks.
3
Modern intresting place,very good installation.You find several experients for your mind,must to visit.
5
been in singapore so many years but had never been up here but i tell you its amazing and cant believe i hadnt been here
4
I went there with my friend from Taiwan in the sunday afternoon . very nice ambience and you can have a great view o the bay area. furthermore they brewed their own beer and it is very good
3
Wonderful view ,but music a bit old fashion ,no dancers ...Full of expats
Just a Bar .At least my opinion .
4
1-Altitude is a great place to enjoy spectacular views across the city centre of Singapore, while enjoying a lounge-like environment.At other rooftop observation decks around the world you are often indoors and behind glass; but at 1-Altitude it's open-air and you get clear views of the surroundings. If the weather is good, you can see as far as Malaysia and Indonesia.I suggest you come in the early evening so you can see the sunset and how the city transforms from day to night.Usually the bar asks you to order your drink already at the very bottom of the building, before even entering the building, which is strange and rather unwelcoming; but just let that one go and enjoy the view! :
4
Quite a popular local drinking hole and great attraction although not cheap. An easy way to see the sights in all directions with the family, friends or workmates. There are higher and cheaper places to see the sights though. I would recommend ION Sky if your looking for a free option that is spectacular
5
At the highest point in SG, the views are astronomical, the service attentive and yet not intrusive. Thanks to Ryan, we had a great time, twice.
5
Excellent view of Singapore with great music at 1 Altitude. Loves the roof-top ambience. Also have another floor for R&B music. Great place to gather and dance
5
When visiting Singapore my partner and I went for an evening out to the Altitude Bar. The views was amazing. Although you pay $35. For entry and 1 drink it's well worth it for the evening views.
3
Visited the Bar in March 2016, basically an open bar concept. Good view from the top and Atmosphere and Ambience are ok.
5
I absolutely loved this bar. I proposed to my Fianceé here last week and she said yes so high above in this dynamic and amazing city.
4
I didn't know what to expect from this. I definitely recommend this over Marina Bay Sands. Was less crowded and a much better view. The drink, albeit is SGD30, was pretty strong and big.
5
Nice magnificent view (360degree) and nice music at night! Had dinner at Stellar and went up to the bar for a chilling session. Overall a very nice experience!
1
No atmosphere. Music too loud. Expensive. Waste of time and money. Grotty...poor decor. ..dirty. over rated.
3
It's a very beautiful place to be to view the landscape of Singapore's central business district but the music was pretty loud blasting away and I wasn't able to get a good chat with my partner who I went along with. We left earlier than planned due to this instants
5
Singapore has some great roof-top bars but One Altitude surely tops them all. Whilst the entrance fee is a little steep and the drinks unnecessarily expensive, the ambience and sounds are really chilled. Its hardly ever crowded with just the right balance of people to space and of course its has a glorious open-air view. And most important of all (unlike other roof-top bars I've encountered most notably in Saigon) the security are not over pushy nor protective and you get to stand and ogle the view wherever you so choose. Love it
4
Nice place. Very trendy and stylish outdoor bar area. Drinks are so so, pricy a bit but it is Singapore :) Weekend is very crowded. The best view should be around sunset.
5
360 View with wonderful experience.
The Lady (Little Bit Fat ) from Malaysia who explained a lot and given a good guidance.
Nice Place to Visit at least one time in your life.
4
This is a very good place to bring your partner and enjoy a few drinks, or to bring your friends and have a fun night.
4
Nice place to get in a early drink before headed to the real places! The view is pretty panoramic and stunning!
3
This is your usual bar hopping scene. If you want to have a relaxed conversation, this would not be the ideal place for you. The roof top view is nice though as it is the highest point in Singapore
3
Personally felt that 1-altitude is very commercialized with the crowd mainly tourist and the crowd there is pretty mature.However, dance floor was great with good music on the lower desk.and of course not forgetting the breath taking million dollar view where we had our table facing Singapore at it's best
3
The highest view point in Singapore and surely the 360 degree vision is simply breath taking. What a pity that management has turned this place into a party zone for the rich and beauty where music is so loud that normal conversation is no longer possible and your ears start to hurt. Best time to go is between 6.30 and 7.30 pm to enjoy the sunset and then quickly disappear to avoid the party animals, unless you want to party....
5
Our family of 6 indulged in an evening of drinks, light dinner and listening to the cool beats at 1 Altitude. $30 entry included one drink. We chose Singapore Slings which were served in pint glasses. Pizza and other light dishes were on offer. All were around $20 each. We arrived before sunset and the view was awesome. It is so much higher than Marina Bay Sands and offers views right across the whole of Singapore as far as the eye can see in every direction. It gets even better after dark. The club music was not too loud, and quite chilled. It was a great vibe.
5
A night well spent in Singapore. Although entrance fee feels steep, it does include your first drink. There was not much of a line and the hostesses on the ground floor were friendly. The views from the top are amazing. The layout is also nice, with the dance floor and bar in the centre and the "deck" a level above and around that. The music was great a had a great casual club vibe. The drinks are not cheap [as expected though].
5
Visiting the tallest place in Singapore before sunset is the best experience especially if you are a photo enthusiast. The food and ambiance are great. I won't get tired of visiting this place from time to time. There's also a great live band playing on the weekend
5
Outstanding, the food was great, people were great, the environment was great, all is good. service is excellent, drinks were top notch
5
The best view Singapore has to offer can be viewed here from the tallest rooftop bar. A party ambiance if the weather is good.
4
To beat the crowd go on a weekday night or early on a weekend night. The view is worth the price of a drink.
3
for me it is too hot and noisy.
Beverages are ordinary level and most annoying part is you have to queue on the first floor. That is absolutely not my style. probably good for younger generation though...
4
This is a unique place atop a tall building. You go there for the stunning views and sunsets.
Food- tasty but pricey.
Drinks - good but pricey
You pay for the view.
4
Great view of Singapore (better than MBS).
Make sure you check the weather forecast before going. Outdoor bar.
Consider going in evening to catch a sunset and followed by the evening view.
5
The view is just spectacular, you also see the Marina Bay Sands Hotel which is a picture worth it. The decoration is very modern and nice and the drinks were fantastic (Singapur sling). There was a singer with an amazing voice, which was the cherry on the top of this great athmosphere. What we also can recommend are the delicious truffel fries! This bar is a must-go in Singapur
5
Make sure you choose a sunny day when you decide to go up there. The sunset and night view is amazing. S$30+ person and comes with 1 free drink. If you are going with a few friends, it is better to make a reservation in advance so you have reasonable size table to accommodate all of you
4
The views up here are undeniably breathtaking. I'd even argue better than MBS because you get to see than building from here. With a 360 degree view out across Singapore, it's the perfect spot to get some awesome pics and amazing for sunset too. My biggest reason for not giving it 5 stars is the fact you have to pay S$30 to get up there, but you do get a drink included in that price and I suppose it's one way of crowd control. The music on various night is a bit hit and miss - I've seen some great live music and had brilliant nights partying up there, but other nights just fall a bit flat. Definitely worth a visit, even if it's just a half hour to get some amazing snaps and enjoy a drink with a view.
5
I absolutely love roof top bars and this place did not fail to disappoint me. It offers an amazing view of the city and definitely worth a visit especially at sunset. It is quite pricey with an entry fee that includes one drink. The additional drinks are on the higher side as well with each drink setting you back by at least 15 dollars. But the entry is worth it for that glorious view. It has a great crowd and decent DJ and even if you are not a party person just go for the sunset views would be my recommendation. In How many places can you feel like you are on top of the world at the 62nd floor?
5
The view is stunning and one drink is included in the entrance fee. A cool thing to do when you want to see how impressive Singapore is
3
Good night view of Singapore. Nice ambience. Not sure about the food though as it has been a long while since i last went there.
Nevertheless, a good option to bring oversea friends to, instead of the over-rated MBS pool...
4
a must visit- entrance fees are reasonable, crowded on friday/ wednesday. plenty of standing rooms but to get a small table, either go early i.e 9pm or need to spend for min spending. the music is so-so lounge bar music but the view is nice!
1
the food is not nice and the staff are not courteous.waited long time for my food. by the time the food arrived,it was not hot.
4
Apart from Marina Bay Sands, Ion Orchard, Swisotel and The Pinnacle, 1 Altitude provides another option to view Singapore from the top of the roof with drinks in hand.
5
When visiting one altitude you'll have to pay 30 SGD at the bottom of the tower and decide which drink you want to have. The offer wasn't that big so we chose bitter lemon. At the top the very nice barkeepers asked us wether we wouldn't prefer a virgin mojito, this drink was very good.The view above singapore is unique and really overwhelming. The waitresses are very friendly ant take photos of you. Definitely worth the money
5
We have read on the internet a lot of controversial opinions about this place, but we have decided to give it a chance. First of all, for that view, the prices are normal, not so expensive. Regarding some comments that i have read here: i dind't find it disturbing that i have to chose my drink(the one included in the entrance fee) from downstairs. Come on, the same choice i was going to make if i had to pick one when I got upstairs. The employees were polite, and when i have raised my phone above the railing the bodyguard was considerate and ask my husbad to make sure i will make the pics from a safe place, so i don t risk to drop my phone. The view in the night is a w e s o m e. It was almost the top experience in Singapore and definetly worth every dollar.
3
So we went to the place reading the amazing reviews. Service was amazing no doubt but since it was raining we couldn't go to the roof top and were inside. There was live music....sort of rock...which was fine but we expected more uplifting music. Honestly we didn't like the covered inside area. Make sure when you go it's not raining since inside because being inside its average
3
Can't fault the view but the fact that the drinks....which are in my view expensive.....are served in plastic glasses lets down the whole experience. It gave it a tacky feel. Went to Ce La Vie at the Marina Sands hotel the next night which was a much nicer experience for a similar price
1
The place and its location is no doubt amazing and the view is just awesome. You wont find a place where you are on much higher level than Marina bay sands. You get breathtaking view of MBS and entire singapore from 62nd floor. But the biggest disappointment is service and rude waiters. And most important thing they serve drinks in dirty glasses. They just dip used glass in a bucket in front of you and then serve drinks. They gave me drink in a very dirty glass so i told the waiter "brother please change the glass its too dirty". He instead of appologizing wiped the glass from tissue and told me see its clean now drink it. What the hell he was thinking im here? i paid for the drink and behaved as if im drinking for free. Will never ever go to this place
4
Great View of Singapore sky line great place to chill. but u need crazy friends to have a nice time hahaha
4
This is a good location for cocktails and dinner. Has a fantastic view of the Marina Bay, and the food of the restaurant is good as well.
4
We held a party on the rooftop. Great service, cool music with DJ and a super view of Singapore. You can grab delicious bar snack or sit in the restaurant for a delightful meal.
3
In my point of view each and every visitors should experience in it.Simply I can say its a heaven.Rattan style furniture with LED light effects is awesome...Other than the wide aerial view,
4
Great look out if you are looking for an awesome city view of Singapore with a cool drink in your hand. Get there before sunset.
5
For ladies, it's recommended to go during Wednesday as they offer Ladies Night. It's also good for couples and friends who wants to chill out and see the 360 view of Downtown Singapore.
3
Rooftop Bar is ideal for couple or group party, it even has a dancefloor. Needless to say, it has spectacular 360deg view of Singapore. As for Altimate, considered boring for friday night. not really crowded, songs werent good and we had the 1st table next to bar, it was lack of AC, people were perspiring!
4
We were taken here by friends to sample the views as the sun sets over Singapore. It's situated at the top of one of the 3 highest buildings and is close to the Marina underground station. At the bottom of the tower, some very slick looking girls take $30 per person which grants you entrance to the rooftop and one drink / cocktail. Mrs Vicar had a Singapore Sling and I had a local beer. If they didn't charge you there, you'd probably stay for the view not buy anything and then leave....... We didn't buy another drink as we were leaving later for a restaurant, so don't know the costs of further drinks once you're already up there.An express lift takes you up to the 62nd floor where you then change lifts to go to the top, about 4 floors further. There are plenty of tables and bench seating but most people stand up for the fantastic 360 degree views. If you arrive about an hour before sunset you can watch the transformation of Singapore as the "sparklies come to life when darkness arrives. The cool breeze at the top is also very welcome. After a walk around the top there was plenty of seating to take in the view. I would expect it gets very busy as it gets later.If you don't visit this place during your stay you're definitely missing out
4
Been to many high levels bars in HK, Shanghai and Bangkok but 1-Altitude 'tops' them all ... Maybe not the highest of them all, but indeed the highest open air bar in the world. Amazing, stunning 360views and a cool celeb atmosphere and a great DJ indeed. Dancing and partying with such views makes you high without drinking too much as the drinks are indeed quite pricy - beer at SGD 19 .... But still - enjoy !
5
Awesome place to drink. Outstanding views. $30 (about Â£15) gets you entry to the bar/club and a cocktail. Singapore is very expensive so this isn't bad. Highly recommend sipping a Singapore Sling up here whilst chilling to the tunes taking in the views. Chilled atmosphere. Can get busy, but not unlike any other descent bar. Dress code is smart. Trousers/shoes recommended to ensure you don't get turned away
4
Ok.. its flashy, glitzy and utterly fabulous. great views over the city. Nice drinks if a little pricey but normal really for Sing. Would happily go back and is handy for popping over to Clarke quay afterwards.
4
Roof top of one of Singapore's highest buildings in the business district. Cool night air and an amazing view, with live music. Comfortable open-air setting. Good for groups or small tete-a-tetes. Enter by the lift at the black wall on Ground Level of the bank.
3
the title says it all. come for the views and if you are in the mood stay for generic dance music. the entrance fee of 30+ dollars buys a house drink from the bar.
5
Great ambiance,360 degree view,drinks a bit costly,great music,open till 4 am,high standard crowd,good service.
5
nice music, nice view , awesome drinks...it really surprised me when the Dj played a indian music ..it was simple awesome
5
Checkout Altimate two floor at 61. You be suprised . Awesome dance club. Heard only open Friday and Saturday .
5
Awesome view from roof top! Must visit spot in Singapore. The whole Singapore can be seen and its affordable too!!
5
This bar was were we held a goodbye party for a study abroad group at the end of our program. We all became great friends and this bar was a fabulous way to end out trip. The view is gorgeous, the drinks and food are probably expensive (but our program paid for it so who cares) and the service and music were on point. We had other plans later in the evening to hang out with younger people our age, so we left before anything got crazy. Great place for a date or a party. *High*ly reccommend it
3
Since our office is right opposite One Raffles Place, where the bar is, we have come here several times whenever there are overseas visitors. We all know that the only reason to go is for the view. It is indeed breathtaking and worth checking out. The mandatory ticket includes one drink and you know, don't expect world class mix or value for money. Take some picture and enjoy some breeze. Move tot he next bar for real drinks
5
If you are travelling to Singapore and want to check out the nightlife in Singapore this is one place you should definitely visit. For Ladies specially the best day to visit is on a Wednesday coz it is the ladie's night with free entry and 10$ Cocktails :) First time i went to this place was with a gang of ladies and we partied till the club closed at 4am. The cocktails are great specially the flavored mojitos and cosmopolitan. Lastly the view .. one of the tallest places in Singapore and the 360 degree view of Singapore is just mindblowing.
4
Good fun place. But like any big bar and club, the crowd is mixed. The view is spectacular from here. Music is nice.
5
The best view in Singapore that one may get, especially with events like F1 race period. the choice and options are great too.
5
The Staffs are extremely friendly. Great Service even when its Packed. Great Experience and Fantastic Atmosphere
5
Get to see lots of ship parking outside Singapore sea. Ships of different size gleaming with lights at night, awesome n beautiful.
4
Great view and nice drinks. Try to pink a nice with calm winds, as you are pretty exposed up there. Smart to book a table too.
4
The place is what you would expect... Music was okay, drinks were good but pricy and the view is amazing. Mix of locals and tourists overall it is a place that you should go to as a tourist but lacks soul. Typical roof top bar in a big city.
5
Imagin if you are at the top of Marina Bay Sands, you would see the skyscraper of Singapore, that's it, you can't see the symbol of Singapore, because you are at the top of MBS. However, if you are at this bar, where is roop-top and open aired bar, you can see not only Singapore night view but also Marina Bay Sands, even endless ocean. All alcohols are reasonable price, considering the location and view. I rather prefer to have bottle, because you would drink a lot once you see the beautiful night view under the buidlin
5
I visited with my wife, daughter and boyfriend. Although it is expensive at 30 Singapore dollars per person to get in, you do get one drink, and as Singapore is expensive for drinks it does not represent bad value.The bar itself is one floor below the rooftop, and we got our drinks (Cocktails) before heading onto the roof. The views are simply breath taking with 360 views across Singapore, with a particularly great view over the Singapore river and towards the Marina bay sands hotel.The only downside is if you do not like heights as I found it slightly terrifying as only a 4ft clear glass partition protects you, and there is no safety netting, and it is 62 floors straight down. I looked at the views and then moved 10 feet back from the edge. How others can lean against the panels and look at the view is beyond me.In the bar area a reasonable good band was playing when we visited. I would recommend visiting at night, we went at 8pm, and stayed until 9.45, as we wanted to watched the light show which takes place in the Marina basin at 9.30
4
i. I was invited by my friends.o The view was just breathtaking! o Amazing night skyline of this Lion City!o Can see the Marina Bay Sands from the top.o Cool and breezy.o Atas (luxurious/ elegant).x Can be quite loud.- Please be well dressed! Smart casual at very least.ii. You take two lifts. :
5
It's a good place for spending an evening,But do remember to make a reservation earlier, to have a seated table for your group. You'll get tired after a while, if you walk in, because they only offer standing tables then.I usually prefer places which have nice drinks, I didn't like their drinks very much (I mean cocktails), or food, for that matter...The view from that height is definitely cool
4
It is just amazing that you are having a good time while listening with the band or music, with the place not crowded and not so smoky. It is refreshing while enjoying a sip of your drink
5
We have tried to Flyer and the Marina Bay Sands viewing platforms and this is by far the best viewing platform as it looks down on Marina Bay Sands and the gardens. Easy to get to on Metro
3
Quite average for a rooftop really, nothing special. The usual sort of food and cocktails, nothing exceptional in that regard either
4
Must must must go. The view is splendid at the top...decent finger food...drinks are bit pricy...but worth the ambience and view.
5
An amazing place to enjoy evening (won't mind doing it every evening). Fine selection of drinks. A very good place to hang out and chill with friends.
4
Awesome ambience and view. Sometimes, there is a live band which peps up the place. Can get really crowded on weekends and ladies night though. Don't miss out their truffle fries and chicken wings!
5
去旅行都喜歡找rooftop bar小喝一杯高空欣賞一下該城市的景色relax一下
剛結束的新加坡之旅就找了這家聽說是新加坡TOP 5的rooftop bar
6pm後basic每人SGD30包一杯飲料
建議可待到8時看金沙的燈光show而且越夜人越多越熱鬧也有live band
可惜我們趕行程忘記了這個節目早了一點點走就覺得有點浪費
5
This place has best views of Singapore, better than Marina bay Sands Sky park or Singapore Flyer. Go late after 9:30pm. View is 360 degrees and is spectacular. They have entry fee of 30/35 that gives you a free drink.We ordered a Satay platter later and was surprised by the portion size, 20 sticks in $30++, well worth and Satay was fresh and delicious. Crowd there is excellent, good for a romantic evening
4
Impressive view of course, and without doubt the best 360° of Singapore CBD and beyond.Sometimes good music too.But the decoration and outside furniture are a bit cheap and of disputable taste. Food is average but this is not the reasons you came here in the first place.Beware that the place may close unexpectedly in case of lightnings or rain

My boyfriend and I went there for his birthday celebration. It was a wonderful place with an excellent view of Singapore. We couldn't stop taking pictures! The best time to go would be just before sunset, so you can see the colours of the city change from evening to night. We each had a juice as we don't drink alcohol. There was an event at a corner of the rooftop bar, so the area was blocked off and we could not access, but we stayed long enough until the event was over and the area was open to public again. It felt rather posh for us, and we were not that formally-dressed, but no one said anything about our dressing. So it was all good. Great experience, would like to visit again

Celebrated my birthday at this gorgeous location. I have never been here before and was pretty excited. My friends and I ordered a few drinks and enjoyed the music very much. The best part was.. the night view was amazing!
5
There are plenty of other nicer high rise chillout place to go but if you prefer a quiet and empty bar on the top of the building, this is the one. Have fun!
5
Visited here after our meal and just had to have a Singapore Sling. Entry fee covers one drink and this + the view are definitely worth it. Live music and the view were spectacular. We also watched the Marina Bay light show.

When you walk into a place like 1-Altitude, you know that you're paying for more than just food and drinks. The world's highest gastrobar boasts of some really great views and is must-see place for your visiting friends/family.
Tip: their truffle fries are UH-MA-ZING!
5
My first time at the 1 Altitude top roof bar was memorable. The view on the whole city of Singapore was so amazing but the best of all was the kindness of the staff. I met Kenzie there and he was so friendly and so nice with me and my friends. The service he gave to us was far above what we were expected. I'll come back again for sure.Thank you very much Kenzie and Rem

Been meaning to get to One Altitude for a long time, but bad weather and private parties had stood in the way. Finally got there last year. After the ear-popping ride up in the elevator, got out to enjoy the views - which are spectacular. But the overall feel was of a tourist attraction rather than a cool bar. Not a place I would go for drinks once the views had been absorbed
3
What can I say about the tallest bar in Singapore if not the world ... I have visited a number of times and always found it ok instead of a thrilling exciting experience. Randomly areas of the roof bar are blocked off or it seems like some areas are half finished but maybe that's just because I'm picky. It's a bar with a view and as a resident of Singapore it's only something for the tourists in my opinion. Nevertheless it is worth a look and is something different from being on street level
4
I have heard a lot about this place but I have never thought of going there due to my fear of height. Thus it took me quite a while before I finally step foot into 1-Altitude. But guess what, you donâ€™t have to worry at all, even though the bar is at 63rd level, you will feel completely safe. Great place to relax, chill out, and enjoy your drink with your friends. Cheers
5
I wanted to surprise my partner the day before my birthday with a visit to 1 Altitude,We got dressed up and we walked from the Oriental Mandarin to 1 Altitude, of course we were sweating and getting annoyed because as we walked towards 1 Altitude a huge storm was heading there also, we decided to go up anyway, the lady at the ticket booth was lovely and friendly and said we should get a bit of time up on the rooftop bar area before the storm hits,You go up to the 61st floor I think it was then into another lift to the 63rd floor. It cost us 33 sgd each and you get a drink included, I was surprised our Singapore Slings were so big, the view was breathtaking and we got a few good photo's before the staff advised we had to go in as we watched the storm approach.They moved us to the 61st floor which was a nightclub, and the view from the windows were stunning, we watched as the storm hit, finished our drinks and went back to ground level, I was surprised my fear of heights did not stop me from going near the glass wall and take photos.Enjoyed this experience immensel
4
Visited this place with my family and friends. Atmosphere was majestic only thing is that the place is most of time crowded because of its popularity. You will get one drink free with purchase of ticket. Food is good. Almost all variety of drinks and cocktails. Try Singapore sling
3
Its a nice place but nothing so special except that is high up. The drinks are pretty expensive and always a long q to get in.,
5
Good music (depending on the night), good food and drinks and a GREAT place to relax with friends after a busy week. The view from the top is BREATHTAKING!
Just don't drop your phone! :)
4
This is a great place to have a beer or martini, overlooking Singapore's business district, it is especially a beautiful sight at night, at 63 levels high.
5
Great view and great service. I understand that the price might be a little high, but it is totally worth the experience
5
For $30 you get to hang out on this rooftop bar with stunning views of the city and skyline. And once you're ready to dance just take the elevator down a few floors to the club, which is included in your entrance price, along with one drink. Definitely a fun night!
3
Now is a good time for some spring cleaning, while the entrance is expensive at 30SGD, the drinks are actually quite cheap and the views are spectacular, as always. The set-up needs refinement, the wine I got was served on glass that must have been scratched a thousand times, and there were a lot of marks on it. The staff were corteous and the cover band was also ok
5
Everyone needs to visit 1-Altitude, if not for the drinks just stop by for an hour for the views alone, they are incredible!! Very cool rooftop bar but be prepared to pay on average $30ish per drink for the privilege...we stayed for a couple of hours and it was worth every cent
5
Found this really different than other places in Singapore. Its a simple rooftop on top of maybe the tallest building in Raffles. One can see its having some odd zig zag walkways but then its a rooftop. Overall its a good place. I think there is a cover charge at the elevator entrance which might be steep for some. But I think Wednesdays are lady nights and free or cheaper. Good place to take someone who is from out of town. Not much women though and crowd was mixed. I felt seating is less as compared to standing. No loud music was a good thing and I think they have a good live band there
4
It was a business meeting but the view to kill for took away most of my attention. The drinks and food are surprisingly reasonable, considering that it offers such an awesome view of Singapore's skyline. The service staff are warm and offers free smiles, a rarity here in hard Singapore. (I'm Singaporean by the way). Told a waitress I was hungry and she made sure I got my food orders once the kitchen opens. Will be there again definitely
5
I visited couple of sky - lounge bars in Singapore but for me, 1 altitude is still the best among them. It's simply giving you stunning view of Singapore (including financial district & marina bay area). Price wise, its just standard like other bars in Singapore. However, sometimes to get into highest floor, they will charge you $25-$30 but sometimes it's free, depend on your luck i guess!
4
Visitors will be required to purchase one drink before taking the lifts. Quality of drinks and service is lacking at the bar. Redeeming factor is the fantastic view of overlooking the city.
4
Atmosphere is good. Drinks are reasonable but what makes the night awesome is the right companion, with the right drinks.
5
It can get very windy on some nights so try to avoid wearing flare dress / skirts for ladies. Dance to the electro house music while sipping beer and enjoy the breath taking view overlooking Clarke Quay / Chinatown area.
5
We went to this place with office friends to celebrate the evening. The view was great , drinks were awesome however food was ok . I would recommend visiting it
5
The music is nice, they play both R&B and hiphop, new and old school. It is amazing with 360' view in the hot night breeze on 63rd floor.
3
Tourist central and priced accordingly. It's not as unique as it once was with so many roof top bars in SG and it needs to recognise that in it's pricing and service
4
If you want to admire the views and escape the stuffy humidity of the streets below without being in an aircon chilled bar then this place comes highly recommended. A good few degrees cooler with a pleasant breeze when I visited. Stunning 360 views from the roof terrace bar. Entry was free for ladies and S$30 for gents, but included a "free" drink. Steep for a drink but you're really paying for the view and the experience. Head up early though (we went at around 10) as the queue had built up since we were there and was long when we left.
1
I had 3 nights in Singapore. I made the effort to visit the bar only to be told that no tripods are allowed (despite the reviews stating otherwise). Sure, you might say that photography is not the viewing galleries main purpose, but what the point of advertising the view. I'm so disappointed by the narrow mindedness of this management.
4
As this is the highest rooftop bar in Singapore, it has an unbeatable Singapore skyline view at night. Unlike the view from MBS, from here you can see the Iconic Marina Bay Sands building!This place is great to chill out to have few drinks with friends, but not really for people who's looking to have fun in the dance floor. They have the dance floor as well, but the music and the crowds are pretty lame. Altimate, another club at level 59 (you need to pay entrance fee seperately) have better music and crowds
5
We were looking for a good view of the city at night and and expat recommended we try Altitude One.Glad we took their advice as the view was amazing!You pay $30 to go up and that includes a drink. The staff were great and the view was stunning. The bar had a great vibe to it and the live band was terrific
1
Worst service ever from any bar or club that i have ever went to in my life !!!!! Over priced drinks and terrible service.... did i stress terrible service !!!
5
love the 360degree view! awesome place,come during sunset or party till late. Entrance fee is about $30 with one drink. Totally worth it. Come on ladies night its free:-) Love the music and the vibe just awesome!
1
Cant deny the fact that is has a breath taking view. But Drinks are way overpriced and service very poor
4
Its definitely a great place to be. I will surely be recommending to go there. I love the ambience, all the people you can mix up with. Feels great to write this review and encourage people to go there.
4
Its a nice place to catch Sun set and the night view but sometimes can be hot, humid, hazy. It's the tallest building in Singapore so you can have a great experience there.
4
Stunning views at the highest alfresco bar in Asia. we have had several parties here and you are paying for the view, service is very good although let down by only one lift working at the time
3
Great place to catch a bird's eye view of Singapore. I was there with some friends. The place was crowded and we could not find a place to sit to enjoy the drinks we ordered and to appreciate the fabulous view. The weather was humid and we were all perspiring, which sort of dampened our spirits. The management could do better to control the number of patrons permitted so we can have a place to sit and relax. They can consider installing cooling fans so we can enjoy the view and the company of friends in a more relaxed setting
5
The highest Al-fresco bar in the world. You will surely fell in love with Singapore once you come up to this place. 360 view of the whole city. What can you ask for more. They make legit cocktails, so it makes it okay to pay a little more for a cocktail. One of my favorite place in Singapore
3
The service staff here really needs to learn some manners. One of the security men was so rude. I wish I had noted his name. One of my friends had her purse on another table next to her and he made a huge face and said better pick this up else someone will flick it. When we asked him if he could help us take a pic he said that's not my job! And later we saw him click pics for another group. It may not be his job but he does not have to treat the guests in such an impolite manner! Other service staff was also super slow and not friendly at all. Such a shame given the money the place demands for cover charge and average food. Such a let dow
5
This is a spot that is a favorite and where I always take friends that are visiting me in Singapore. Views all around are amazing. Ladies night is Wednesdays and so worth it ! There is a fantastic live set most nights and they are really great! the 360 view of Singapore is unbeatable. I have never been on a night where the DJ stirred up much dancing unfortunately , even though I have wanted to dance a little, the set is too varied and doesn't keep up the momentum. Maybe I am not there past midnight however. I think this is better than the MBS for a 360 view of the city. From the MBS you can see all the CBD and Marina Bay but not much further beyond, here you can really have a great view of all areas
5
Staffs are attentive and always around when you need them. Great venue for events, or get together especially with the great nightline of Singapore at night!
5
It is the highest open air bar in Singapore with an amazing view of the city state. A must do for all.
4
An amazing place to see the skyline of Singapore. It's an ideal place to bring your partner on a date.
Food quality is ok not that vegan / vegetarian options.
Abience - awsome
5
The place is great. we have fun. The view was fantastic and would definitely visit the place again in the future.
4
Worlds highest outdoor bar. Fun place to visit. A bit expensive elevator ride up to 63rd floor, but ticket price included one drink at the top. Singapore Sling was good, but very watered down. Still a fun night.
4
Must go in terms of the many sky bars in Singapore, drinks are very expensive though so watch out for that.
5
Good service, good music but it.s higly popular so you must reserve a table otherwise u can just stand with your drink.
5
If view is what you are looking for..1-Altitude is the place..the breathtaking view of Singapore skyline is simply amazing..they have good drinks is additional bonus.
3
where foreigners or those girls who want to hock up with foreigners go out. great view but the staffs were not nice. one time experience was more than enough.
4
Great views of the city and drinks are not overly priced as it would if it is a popular tourist destination. Good for a date or girls' night out.
5
It's probably best open bar and best view and music in Singapore. Rain can be a spoil spot. Otherwise it will get you high
4
great view, food & drink are not much better than other bars but definitely more expensive.
Worth to come though, even just for the view.
5
這裡應該是CBD區 最高樓 眺望到MBS最美的酒吧!! 我記得最後一次是在F1結束後的after party. 美好的夜晚!! It always my first choice for chill when friends visit here.
5
It's the highest and best view for a roof top in Singapore
The view is 360 degrees
Good view on Marina Bay Sands
You have to pay 1 drink before going up to the roof top
Music is very loud
4
Gives you panoramic view of the entire Marina Bay. Do note that it's a long long queue on Wednesday night for Ladies' night so go early or you'll be shut out.
3
Altitude bar . Well its 35 $SGD Per person to get to the roof . That said that includes one drink and becuase this bar is located on the 63rd floor you may find you need one if concerned with vertigo . There is no question that this bar ticks the boxes for a serious panoramic of Singapore but sadly it lacks in most other areas. The floor feels rickety and uneaven , The bar furniture is plastic and ill thought out. Drinks are expensive . however so are most drinks of an alcoholic nature in Singapore, You very much feel like you have arrived at a tourist trap as people wander around with iphones held high , but to be fair you have ! Its worth a trip up day or night (night is more spectacular with Singapore lit up) but you will be dropping as said 35 sgd to do so and after you have snapped a couple of pics it is likley that you will be heading back down to street level.One point that was impressive aside the view was the live band playing , The female vocalists was astonsihingly good and i thought it was a recording until i saw her in the flesh on the way out. If you are looking for a more sohpisticated bar with a veiw my suggestion would be Marina Bay Sands, Still its not every day you get to sip a drink on the 63rd floor with only sky above you 
4
Ladies nights on a Wednesday normally when I go as its $10 cocktails and free entry for ladies. its a bit busier also. The view is obviously amazing but the music is a little random. Expect terrible 90's hits a maybe some decent live music if your lucky.
5
I thought this restaurant was romantic. I enjoyed sitting at bar. The food was good. Well cooked. The bar is definitely the centerpiece of this restaurant. We were there during someone's anniversary party but it was quiet and our service didn't suffer for it. I would recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a romantic dinner venue
4
Nice place in the centre of city to spend your weekend. Roof top on 63rd floor. with standing tables. Sitting place available with booking and price commitment. Avoid going on days if there is rain forecast as this is roof top with all open space. DJ will close if it rain and you will be asked to move into Altimate bar which is disc two stories under it and is little noisy to carry out any conversation
5
After having our awesome anniversary dinner at Steller at 1-Altitude, we decided to give it a short 5-10 min visit to the viewpoint, Gallery & Bar. It turn out to be one of the best view-point of Singapore to us with amazing Jazz n cocktail , and we spent more than 2 hours there. Decided to be back anytime soon with our friends. A very good night-out place with friends with the Singapore's Iconic Marina Bay Sands, Flyer view. Don't miss if you visit Singapore.
5
Wonderful view from the top, check weather forecast first so you enjoy........drinks could be a bit stronger but maybe that's because of the altitude :-)
4
Want a great view of singapore...?? This is the right place to head to... The wide selection of food and drinks and view is perfect time off work or holiday...near down to enjoy your drink over a scenic view!!!
5
Breathtaking view of singapore, nice romantic ambience.. Eventhough slightly on the higher price range, its so good given its view, music and windy atmosphere @ attic
4
Perfect place for a late afternoon drink, sundown from this place is amazing.
The place is not cheap but worth it. One small advice: no sandals, flip flop for males...
4
Excellent panorama over Singapore with great view on the bayside and CBD. Also easy to find and conveniently located next to a subway station. Pay 30 or 35 for a visit, including one drink.
5
The top floor of Marina Bay Sands Hotel isn't the only place that offers a great view of the CBD in Singapore. This is a place that every tourist in Singapore has to check out. Great music, great views. An experience you would neither regret or forget
5
Went there for anniversary celebration..cheers Had wonderful experience Bit costly ...30 Singapore dollars per person Nd one drink free The views deserve the price ...Singapore flyer Nd marina bay looks small from there Must thing to do is take 360 walk I have attached a pic of view from 63level Nd yes it is situated at 63 floor raffles 1 buildin
5
There's nothing much to say: Go there, pay 30 SGD, select a Singapore Sling or Monster Caipiroska, go up, open your eyes, use your camera and shut your mouth (because you will open it once you see the view).Opening hours 6pm to x.Avoid Wednesday night (ladies night) unless you want to fight like through the jungle.Best days Sunday to Tuesday and Thursday.Very often Live Music and DJ in a good rotation
4
Brought my wife and son to this place for the first time. It was a very good experience. The main entrance on on the ground floor looks more like an entrance to a club rather than restaurant that could probably be changed (?) Food was average but the view was stunning. The waiter who served us was nice and helpful but he seemed like a new waiter as doesnt know the menu very well
4
Yes, the prices at 1 Altitude are on the high side, just like the venue: S$30 (£15) for the cover charge (inclusive of a house pour) and S$20+ (£10+) for a cocktail (a lychee martini in my case). But this is Singapore after all (not the world's cheapest city!) - and I'd say the prices are probably on a par with chic rooftop venues in other major capitals (Vista at the Trafalgar in London and Two Rooms in Tokyo spring to mind).There was a bit of needless aggro at the door when I proffered my left hand to be stamped and was told by the female bouncer that she would only stamp my right. The UV ink, however, was pretty cool. 'There. Your wife won't know you were here,' she winked as she ushered me in.Up on the roof deck on the 63rd floor, the vibe was über-cool. 'Where's the best view?' I asked a waitress, and she gestured expansively all around. She got no disagreements from me - on a cool, clear night in January, the 360-degree views of the city from the top were certainly stunning
4
Food was good, the view is great, but the service is haphazard. Wine waiters paid no attention. Could be so much better
5
beautiful 360 degrees in CBD. it doesn't matter if their cocktail is expensive coz you'll come to see the amazing view! a must go! surely i will come back!
1
Except for the view. The rest are a disappointment.
The waiter are rude and not frindly, the music is loud and nosiy
4
If you don't want to join the long queues of the other high rooftop club, 1-Altitude has one of the best views too. A must go.
4
Menu prices are slightly priced higher than others but you pay for good view. Good ideal places for chill out and after office hours drinks for many. Patrons dressed well. Location is very good and easily accessible.
4
As the title goes, the place is great to be with a group of friends. Beautiful 360 degrees of Singapore.
1
When you pay 30 dollars a cocktail you expect a minimum of service, but in Altitude if you're not the one who pays the biggest among of money then no one cares about you.. No place to seat, cocktail served in plastic glass, waiter unfriendly...... I highly recommend to go to another rooftop, the view will be as nice and you won't feel losing your mone
5
This is a good spot to discover the city from above, far better than at the sands, you got an impressive view down into the streets. Amazing lift ride, you feel the elevation speed. Drinks a bit rough and sloppy mixed, kinda expensive in compare, but you ain't got there to get waisted. ;
5
This is the one of the best alfresco bar in Singapore ..the view is breathtaking..:once u reach the top floor the view is amazing..to be speaking honestly the music need to update ..the songs are bit old ...good to have a couple of drinks ..I came back early coz the music was not that great ..I was expecting some good house or electro or some commercial..not old songs ...overall it's worth a visit ..
5
1-Altitude is one of the best bars I have been to. Situated in the Central Business District (CBD), which is the most happening area of Singapore. The crowd is really good and wide variety of food and beverage options. The view from the top is just amazing. It's a must visit place for anyone visiting Singapore
5
Wonderful view, magical scenery and great finger foods. It is worth to go here for leisure. Wish I could come back here soon
5
This restaurant /bar seems to be the highest point in Singapore. You can actually observe the Singapore flyer and marina bay sands skypark at lower levels from here. The staff is very hospitable. You simply cannot miss this place on any Singapore trip.
4
Set at the top of the tallest tower in Raffles Place - drinks not cheap but the view is great and a good thing to show visitors to get your bearings. Much better value than the over hyped Ku De Ta ..
5
Good music and great views, giving you and overview of the main sites of CBD Singapore. Good place to bring friends visiting from overseas.
5
Cool place to chill out at high attitude and wonderful views. reasonable entrance charges and good service staff
4
Subject to weather condition, good place to hang out. However, it can be warm if air is still. In general, I highly recommend.
5
The view is amazing! Wednesday night is ladies night so no cover charge, cocktails are $10 and the music was the best. Loads of friendly people danced and age group seemed to be mid 20's to 50's. The top floor is the view and a bit of space from the crazy dance floor on the second level.It's a must do in Singapore
4
Pay the price of admission (inclusive of first drink)! It's worth it.Stunning view, high above Singapore's skyline. 360 degree view. Depending on the sky clarity you can see Malaysia from downtown....Once you pay the intial entrance fee ($30-35), drinks are reasonably priced, the live band is it progressive and plays a wide selection of tunes.Great place to finish, or start an evening.If you get vertigo or suffer high anxiety. Beware !! It's a long way up....It's worth it ! Try it and see...
3
This is my third time visiting the place for Business. The bar is strategically located and you are able to see the entire Marina bay view, it is also much higher then the famous Marina Bay sand roof top bar (Ku de ta). What I do not appreciate is the service, the staff is slow to response and unable to get the right order for our 6pax table.I will visit the place again as this is THE spot to show when people are visiting, however I will not recommend to spend much on it's F&
4
It's the highest spot in Singapore but I'm not convinced this is the best rooftop bar of Singapore. There are many others to choose from but you always need to go there once...If you are a couple, please go to 1-altitude when it's ladies night on Wedneday. Ladies go in for free and men need to pay 30SGD. Otherwise everyone needs to pay the same amount and now you save 30SGD :-
4
For those who like drinking and want to chillax with besties, and if ambience is a MUST, you have to come to this place.
4
really cool place. great view. go there on a clear night. you can see lights in the distance. really cool a place.
4
Amazing and breath-taking view and amazing songs. You can see the entire Singapore, even the Marina Bay Sands.
3
A place to visit in Singapore, when you come for the first time. It is nice to check how large is the island, where are the main tourist spots. Not a place to find good food or drinking but the view is amazing.
4
Went there for date. WE had an awesome 360 degree view of Central Singapore and the ambiance was very good..
5
Amazing bar with a 360-view of the scenic skyline while relishing your finger foods and beverages with friends or engaging in a simple banter with strangers can be surprisingly delightful.
4
good view there but too many people, normally overcrowded on weekends. not the best bar to go in Singapore
4
It's the highest bar in Asia and it has wonderful view of the Singapore skyline as well as the country. The drinks are at normal club prices and the music is okay. What not to expect - a happening dance floor. Everyone's here mainly to be seen
4
have been to this place on the nice evening, this place is nice to unwind in the evening and i think its highest roof top open bar in Singapore, went there with family and had a nice time, beverages are expensive but worth with the locatio
5
Well worth the $30 charge to go up to the 63rd floor (this also includes a drink, for which you can choose wine, beer, cocktails, etc).The 360 degree view is spectacular and definitely worth the visit. It would be quite expensive to spend a whole evening drinking here, but this is one of my favourite experiences I had in Singapore
4
A place to get awesome view of Singapore's CBD area. The entrance ticket include a free drink. Nice music but few seats are available, so most had to stand throughout the night unless you open a few bottles of wine and make the minimum expediture.
4
Well worth at least 1 drink. Views are amazing can see in every direction. Book a table if possible. Mood a setting perfect.
5
Highest point of Singapore. Romantic and nice place to spend an evening. Good music and friendly people! :)
4
I've went to 1-Altitude last month and visited their Gallery and Bar. The feeling was awesome when i stepped inside the bar and both me and my friend had a lot of fun that night. I will definitely visit the place again .
5
I love this bar. The view is truely amazing and the music is always good. Didn't have a single bad night there. There is a Club below, but I like the rooftop bar a lot more.
5
For a 30 SGD cover charge, you get one drink and for 35 SGD, you get a premium drink. It was an amazing sight on top of Singapore. This bar is located on the highest building in SG on the 63rd floor. Very beautiful view of the beautifully lit city at night. The DJ was good and played great music. There is also a dance floor. Must try drink is of course the Singapore Shling if you have not had it before
2
I've done the roof top at Marina Bay Sands and Level 33 - both are great. I wanted to try the view from Raffles Place. The view itself is good but the bar is pretty terrible.$30 to go up (free at MBS and Level 33) but it included a drink from a pre selected menu. We all chose Singapore Slings in the spirit of being in Singapore. The bar man makes it - pulls out three PLASTIC pint glasses. They all get a splash of the necessary ingredients with a ton of ice. They get a shake and in less than 2 minutes three Singapore Slings are mass produced. Pretty disappointing and student bar experience for $30 and for a prestigious location such as this.I don't recommend this venue
5
1 Altitude offers unparalleled views of the Singapore skyline. Let it be a weekend, a special occasion or transiting in Singapore just for a night - this is a must see in my itinerary for you. After having been to a number of roof top bars in the CBD area, nothing compares to 1 Altitude.

This is my first visit to Avignon in Provence, France and I was so fortunate to have had the opportunity to stay in this beautifully renovated " oh so french " grand mansion with it's baroque facade. In the middle ages this residence, situated opposite the Palace of the Popes was home to visiting Cardinals. As I stepped into the interior of the hotel I was transported into an imaginary world of French 18th century gracious living and elegance. Hotel La Mirande was voted one of 500 best hotels of the world by Travel Leisure in 2007. What is unique about this 4 star hotel is it's size and it's decor , so different to any of the other 5 star hotels I have stayed in . The hotel has only 27 rooms, 1 dining room with terrace, 1 breakfast room, 1 terrace with 3 small public areas for refreshments and relaxation , a Tea room and a small Red Salon for drinks. Every single room was beautifully decorated with walls covered with the most gorgeous patterned fabrics. Lighting everywhere was dim and intimate. I loved our very spacious Large Deluxe room which had a big French window opening out into a garden view below. The walls were covered in expensive printed fabric which gave the room a warm cozy feel . I was told every room had it's own special fabric design on the walls. Our party decided on having the Chef's Table Dinner, a set menu prepared "live" on the old kitchen's wood fired stove. The dinner was excellent . Food was light, healthy and delicious not prepared with oodles of butter and cream . Price for the whole set Menu, 86 Euros, highly recommended!There is also a Cooking School " Le Marmiton" ( chef's Kitchen assistant ) cooking classes given by the best chefs of the area in the hotel's 19th century kitchen, which one can sign up for. I presume those who participate shall be the Chefs' assistants. It must be so fun as I saw a class in action with aprons on having a good time. I wish I could have joined in. Cost per class 80 Euros. Tip: Book early for The Chef's Table Dinner and The Cooking School as both are very popular and seats are limited. When in Avignon and not staying at this hotel, then just do what the locals do . Make a Rendezvous for Tea at Hotel Mirande and enjoy :)

Went recently for drinks. If not for the haze caused by forest fire in Indonesia, the view from the roof top bar would be amazing. Even with the haze, the visibility was still about 2-3 km from the roof top. Drink prices was a bit pricey, but I suppose that's the norm in Singapore. We were there on a weekend, so it was standing room only. However, you can pre-book a table but there is a minimum charge
2
Good for one drink but no more than that. impossible to book a table (as they r "fully booked") however when u come there can see that tables either empty or occupied by some kids drinking beer.
5
Been to this place a lot of times and I have to say it is an excellent hang out place; ideal for both weekdays and weekends!
4
The food was good and the service was great. The good service couple with the nice food makes it a comforting experience. Everything was just right, not to over.
3
Enjoyed the band that was playing over there. Staff service was rather slow but cocktails were very well done.
5
Great for corporate functions, with excellent views all round on the sky roof
Portions a bit small but food tastes great!
4
a different club from where I used to go..
nice view from the top
wonders what will happen if it rain while we were dancing..
lolxxx
4
Nice chill out bar, though it can and may get crowded at times. But for the spectacular night view. It's total worth it.
Not for those with a severe fear of heights though.
3
Given the huge hype of this place i found it a little underwhelming. Perhaps it just was a quiet night and i have to try it again when there is an event happening. We brought a foreign guest up just for the experience and views of the skyline. Drinks are pretty average for the price paid to enter. I would prefer something less mainstream and with more character. Would consider a second chance and a second review though.
4
We went on a Wednesday for the Ladies night, which means ladies have free access to the bar. Due to the haze, the bar was not crowded at all and the view was - well, not so good obviously. But hey, that's not the bars' fault obviously. I will have to come back to see the beautiful scenery!The night we were there they had a very good live band, that only played until about 22.00 and then the dj was playing the music. I would have loved to hear the live band a bit longerâ€
4
Beautiful view of Singapore 360 degree view. Friendly crews though I wish more of them would learn to smile more from security to serving crews. Special thanks to Ryan Kenneth for making our stay pleasant. Love the live performances on Wednesday night. A nice rooftop bar
5
1-Altitude is a roof top bar located at the 72nd floor in Raffles Place. It offers a great view of the city skyline. It is a little pricey, but for the kind of ambiance at offer, I guess it is worth it.
4
It's like u r at the top of the world. Though it's not Singapore highest building, but it's the world's highest al fresco bar. Free admission if you dine at Stellar at 1-Altitude. A must-visit place if you are here in Singapore!
5
This is my most favourite bar in Singapore. The view is amazing! Can see all of Singapore. This place is a must visit.
4
Great night view of Singapore! Wonderful place to catch up with friends and family, and enjoy one of the key night views of Singapore.......
4
Great place to go at least once whilst your in Singapore, especially on a Wednesday night (ladies night. Expect to see plenty of over dressed people considering its an al fresco bar!
4
What's a view of Singapore if you don't see that fascinating piece of architecture- Marina Bay Sands. 1 altitude gives you awesome views of the city and the Bay and beyond. The place offers great drinks and is mostly buzzing. I always miss seeing Marina Bay Sands from kudeta- and that's why this place would be my pick if you want a real 360 degree view of Singapore
5
No words to explain how could be unique a drink at the Gallery & Bar at 1-Altitude ! You stay at the top, an amazing view of Singapore by night...full of lights and - at that time - even the circuit of F1 ......A fantastic Negroni cocktail together with my friends and socializing with people coming from everywhere: from Australia to France.....From Italy (me) to South Africa. Enjoy !
4
I went here straight from work one Friday night and I had a brand new MacBook with me in a box. After a few very tasty cocktails I decided to go home leaving my MacBook up there. I am glad to say thanks, for a great night and looking after my MacBook which was returned to me the next day
3
Good for first timers and coprorate events - Go just at onset of sunset onwards otherwise its just too hot. Note the minumum charges at the door. Otherwise you can also join a local tour that includes a trip up with a drink, however its only one timing for that tour .. between services after Lunch and before dinner ( that may means hot hot hot )
4
Worth going to for the view, much higher than that from the top of Marina Bay Sands, which means you can get some great views of MBS itself. But the drinks are terrible and food is mediocre at best, no seating arrangement for the most part, so it's a stand and take-in-the-view party. Which is great for like 30-45 minutes max, unless you're there to dance and party, in which case, it's fairly decent
4
awesome ambience, awesome view, this is one of the places in SG with unbeatable view, it doesnt get any better
3
Beautiful view of Singapore at night. Al fresco. Drinks expensive for the quality. Wednesday is ladies night, free entrance for ladies.
4
Awesome views (when the haze clears), but not always the easiest place to get into. Beware of the dress code.
5
Amazing views, great staff and we had very good bar snacks. Booked a table which was well worth it as the F1 race was on
5
Gorgeous view of the city and an overall great place to chill with your friends. Ambience is sophisticated and posh so dress well.
5
Great views, great experience. Good place to take visitors. Its a good idea to get on the guest list if you don't want to end up queueing for long
5
This bar is one with the best panoramic view in Singapore and it is one on the highest level. View is perfect on each side of terrace. The best time to visit is from 8pm to 10pm as there is no full of people and you can enjoy in drink and sunset. Do not expect the perfect service as this is club, not restaurant and staff have club service style. Entry fee is 30SGD and including one drink (some cocktails are included). The price looks like a little bit higher but with the drink included it is worth to visit this place
5
If you are into rooftop bars and places with a view, this is THE place to visit when in Singapore. As stated, this is the world`s highest al fresco bar, so I take their world for it. The service was a bit slow during our visit, but you have all that view to enjoy and the sunset if you go there late evening, so we didn`t mind. Definitely worth it
3
Very spacious sky bar with nice view of the city. If it rains it will be helther skelter! The al fresco concept with limited shelter. But on a breezy night it's a good place to chill. This could be an alternative to the Marina Bay Sands sky bar.
4
Definitely a must visit place in Singapore. Please be dressed appropriately, no flip-flops etc. You need to buy a drink upon entry, but the great panoramic views are worth it. It can get a bit crowded so try mid-week just before sunset to get yourself a place
5
one of the best views in town, just head down here after business meetings or for a quick drink with a view on the weekdays
5
I love this place. 1-Altitude has a really nice view on Singapore and a pleasant live music. Drinks are priced a little bit higher than average, but this place worth it.
5
the best bars in singapore and the ambience and the lovely people are amazing.the view from the top is the ice of the cake.
5
Best in class restaurant with Skyview :)
Great food & service.
Great music.
Best for couples & overseas honeymooners
4
Line was long as entry fee is collected right by the entrance of the building. We've spent a good loooong walk going there from where the SG50 festivities were happening by the bay so I was pretty tired. Still, when you get up there, I think no one would be able to help themselves. The music will bring anyone alive. And that view! Add a few cocktails and laughter, it's a truly awesome experience. Glad my feet didn't give up on me
5
This rooftop bar is a long way up, excellent views of the city, especially at night. You see the Marina Bay Sands light show from a perfect vantage point. The drinks were cheap as it was Ladies night on a Wednesday so $10 martinis and they were awesome. Great service and service at your table.Good atmosphere and great setting.Very friendly security man took our photo - excellent evening!!!
5
A breathtaking rooftop bar with a magnificent 360Â° view of Singapore's centre. A perfect place to watch the nightly light show at the Marina Bay and enjoy - truely delicious - cocktails and longdrinks. The live music was great, too. The cover charge for getting in includes the first drink - your chance to get a really good Singapore Sling! - and is certainly worth the magnificent panorama
5
I visited on a Sunday evening. I had spoken with Sammy on the phone before arrival so getting in was not a problem. I understand on some nights, this can get really popular.When you eventually get to the top, the views are enough to take your breath away. Indeed this is a great spot to see the Marina Bay Sands light show.On a Sunday, there is live music playing and this created a really nice chilled vibe.Drinks were typical (expensive) Singapore prices and the food was average but you come here for the view and the ambiance which you get in buckets.Worth a visi
5
What a view of the City, I kinda like it better than the rest. Book in advance so that you get some good tables. Food is average but the view makes up for it. The staff is very helpful and may take time to attend some times. Its worth the wait though..Have Fun
4
A unique experience on top of one of the tallest buildings in Singapore. A place to take visitors or visit if you are from out of town. You can reserve a table with guaranteed minimum spend which I think is reasonable. But if you go when it is less busy it's easy enough to get up there for a drink and enjoy the views. A good visitor experience
4
Spectacular view of the city skyline in the night, young crowd, good music, no space to dance,breezy & cool
3
Breath taking views of the night lights of Singapore. But that's about it. Food and drinks standard are average.
4
A great place to visit, a lively venue for drinks in the CBD. However the bar does close if there is lightening
5
Don't miss this place.....Must go if you are visiting Singapore OR for a special celebration if living in Singapore. Gives you an amazing view of Marina bay and the entire CBD (Central Business District) area. Great food and service. Bit expensive though
5
Wonderful place with the best views of Singapore. You cannot miss this place because it's on top of the Marina Bay Sands Buildings. Elevator brings you up to the 78th floor. Admission fee is SGD 10 pp.
5
First things first - admission is pricey at $30 however it is more than worth it for the view! The View of the Business District and the Marina Bay complex is incredible! Definitely worth at least one visit!
3
Worth a visit if you are in Singapore. Great view and music entertaining you. I recommend you to go there by 6pm as you can see the sunset slowly fading into darkness and sipping your glass of wine.
4
Great place to chill and grab a few drinks with friends, it has the best views of Singapore! The music was also good that night and as it had been raining previously, it wasn't too crowded when we were there.
4
We went up there a few times. One of my friend was paid member for years. We always got a good service. Nibble was OK. The wine choices not too bad. Definitely will be back again for girly night.
5
Went there with my girl friends on a Wednesday night so we got in for free. Regular cover charge is about $30 so if you don't want to spend that much, Wednesday! They also have $10 cocktails promo on this day.Aside from the extraordinary view and cool music, the staff were very friendly and helpful too.Btw, I love their mojito.
5
Woah! I thought the view from Marina bay sands was cool. But this beats it by a large distance. A good glass of wine with the sunset view ;) it's great.
3
World class view. If you want to be a slick banker-geek on a big budget go here. It's in the financial district, and I went because acquaintances were going.
5
great place to take people visiting from out of town and see the gorgeous view or just a great place to dance the night away. book in advance if you wnat to sit if not ample place to stand around
4
If you are in singapore , u must visit 1 Altitude bar , breathtaking view! Singapore from 67 floor, beautifully lit skyline
5
Wide selection of Canapes! Great location to host private / corporate event.
Elegance night view from the rooftop, staffs are extremely strict on the access to rooftop if the weather is not suitable to do so (thunder) - which is good.
4
Great view from one of the highest building in Singapore. Big tip if you are there before 9pm. Try to get a view of Marina Bay so when the laser show is played, you can have the best view. If you are there during the rainy season, please watch out as sudden downpour can be a damper
5
wonderful view & breezy - lovely concept to be able to satnd "above spore ' & wtch the beautiful city whixst having a delicious drink or cocktail - good way to introduce friends toa panoramic view of the beautiful city of spore with its lovely lights by nightfall
4
If you've never been, the gallery gives you a 360-degree view of the entire city. They have a entry charge of SGD30 or SGD35 which includes one drink; the higher charges is for a premium drink. Drinks are fairly expensive (as the rest of Singapore) but definitely recommended to go there at least once
4
Forget everything else this place has the best 360 degree view in Singapore, stunning, you can see the whole of Singapore plus Indonesia and Malaysia from up there. Even better with champagne if you wish to woo a girl, client or just have fun with friends or family
5
I went to thos restaurant where we hoated one of our corporate events and dinner. the view is fantastic....the restaurant at 62nd floor and the roof top bar odfers you a fantastic view of Singapore. Food is good with good selection of wine. its a fansastic reataurant for personal/ official purpose.
4
Cool place. Great views. Always busy on Fridays. Great crowd and friendly service. Awesome place to go with your friends.
4
The view of 1 Altitude is spectacular!!
Good place to party with friends, the house music was entertaining.
2
... which is spectacular.
But you pay 30SG$ to get up, only including a beer/softdrink/small cocktail.
For further drinks and food, prices are too high and the music is far too loud which makes the stay unpleasant.
5
Good place to be for drinks and stunning views of the city and marina bay area
Drinks are selective and bar is well stacked.
5
Great place
Very friendly staff
Amazing view
Reasonably priced drinks and food
Entrance includes 1 free drink
4
A great place to enjoy the view, while enjoying the well-served drinks and food dishes supporting you to smile. I always enjoy the fresh breeze, sometime the beautiful lightning too. Sometimes even a good cigar that adds to the joyful heights. A good place for my business partners visiting Singapore. Would only advice the management to slight reduce their prices, because it shocks visitors to pay SGD35 for a beer
5
went up there few times and awesome place to hang out, but provided you dont go there during weekend, weekend it is going to be crowded and you won't enjoy the scenery. suggestion you come in group it would be much fun, and dont use this to be a dating place especially when you just know someone
1
Compulsory 40 SGD drink to be purchased before you go up, and once there THE (not that good) MUSIC IS WAY TOOOO LOUUUUD !!! Impossible to hear my friends speaking 20 cm. from my ears! And the glasses around the rooftop had not been cleaned for... monthes?
4
it was an impromptu visit to 1-Altitude - but the experience was magnificent! mostly expats and some locals. The house music was entertaining and people aren't really there to dance. But if you got what it takes - dance first! The layout was neo-mordern. though hot environment without aircon, but if you are with the right people, your life just rocks above the heat. Go for it
4
It's a great place to see Singapore's skyline - you can get a nice drink, listen to music & view the beautiful lights all at one time. An energetic roof top bar & is the closest you can get to the 'touch' skyline' as it is not enclosed (therefore no air condition) & having only the sky over your head!
5
best spot to see Singapore by night and great atmosphere. Ladies enjoy free entrance on Wednesday. Try to be there on time to watch Matina Bay Sands laser show.
4
Great view and nice drinks... Perhaps best in Singapore... Bit expensive though but highly recommended for a drink...
5
Great place to take your love to celebrate your occasions! Great view and energy! Check out ladies night specials, too, to save some for all the guys.
4
View is fantastic . The building is taller than MBS. However, it was a bit warm for me as I could not feel the wind . the safety wall is taller than me.
5
This is a must. I was fortunate to have an invitation to be here for the SG 50 celebrations and it was quite spectacular. It is worth going before dark and staying. You can walk all around - 360 degrees view with glass wall. Drinks are not cheap but as expected in any nightclub.
4
Went twice to this selfie-mekkah during a 10 day stay in Singapore which by itself should be a good seal of quality. First time solo to spend a saturday night in Singapore on something else than hanging out at business hotel. Returned a second time with girlfriend to show the 360 view.Rooftop bar entry fee includes one drink at about 20 or 30 SGD pp. Good value for money but subsequent drinks were a bit over priced. The drinks were nothing fancy so it is the view you come for (although my taste buds prefered the Singapore sling here over the too sweet Raffles original). Dance floor which was surprisingly empty even on a Saturday night so I wouldnt go here for clubbing
4
You come for the view of Singapore, and it for sure delivers! The 360 view of Singapore will amaze you, but I'd advice you to come at sunset to get the best out of the visit. Earlier in the day would be too hot and the chances for rain bigger. Negatives would be the limited number of seat and the prices - but hey! It's Singapore - everything is pricey except the hawker centers.
4
One of the best places to have a nice bird's eye view of Singapore. There is a cover charge of SGD 30 and you have options to get drinks form a wide range of options. The music is really good but the best part is the view and the breezy location. Enjoy travelling
3
Like with the bar atop the Marina Bay Sands, the main reason for visiting 1-Altitude is the view.The ambience it tries to set is one of funky, laid back coolness and feels more laid back than "the other rooftop bar" at MBS.Depending on what you want this may or may not be a good thing. It was super easy to get a seat with a fantastic view, even around peak times like sunset.The price of admission is pretty steep at $30 per person, even though a drink is included. It's because the drinks themselves are just not worth the price. The cocktails had barely any detectable alcohol and the wine was very average at this price. You really are paying $30 for the view alone. That said, the view IS better than the view from MBS so if that's what you really want it's probably ok for a one off visit. But I can see myself ever going back
4
For tourists, go up for a sunset drink to admire the 360 degree view of Singapore, which even the top of MBS cannot offer. For partygoers, weekends after 11 pm is when u you can enjoy some nice beats and the view. More loungy than clubbing
5
Tempat nongkrong yang hip. Awesome rooftop setting with the breathtaking city view. If you are into socialising guys wait no more. Swingby!
4
Great night view of Singapore. Value for money for their price on the drinks and food. Fast and efficient service.
4
Great view. So much better than Marina Bay Sands. Drinks on the roof at sunset are the best. If you want a great dinner head down one level to the restaurant.
4
Definitely worth checking out if you're visiting Singapore, a better view of the city then most other roof top bars, the bottle prices are pretty decent for Singapore standards but as usual the service is terrible, but you get used to that in this city.
5
Nice music and nice views. A good place for the working class after work for relaxation and expanding social circles.
4
Fun place, good views, slow service. Waiting time to go up can be quite long. Many locals as well as tourists.
4
Great view, worth going up here rather than Marina Bay. Nice music and atmosphere, was a bit quiet on the night we went and weren't allowed to reserve a table. There were plenty of 'Reserved' tables empty for ages - just for a show I presume. A bit pretentious, but fun to dress up and enjoy the sunset and night-scape! Would go again
5
The 1-Altitude bar is located at the top of One Raffles Place. It's 63rd floor location makes it one of the highest night spots in Singapore, commanding an unparalleled and breathtaking view of Singapore. It is a nice place to unwind and enjoy, with the bar's numerous drinks available for order. It is quite usual for guests to enjoy the bar just by standing or walking around and enjoying the view, but if one wants to occupy a table it is suggested that a reservation should be done at least three days in advance and that a consumable amount of SGD200 be made. The bar also has a spacious dance floor downstairs where one can dance through the music all night long. Overall, the bar's location and service deserves coming back for more nights of fun
1
I have been to this bar about 5 times,not has a fantastic view but that's it.The whole place is entirely let down by the staff, the service and their attitude!! They should call it "Attitude None!"* The level of attentiveness is appalling, staff would rather do nothing or chat to each other than serve customers and even then it comes with an attitude that says: "I cannot be bothered to serve you!"* When you do get served it takes forever to get your drinks and they may as well throw them at you!* our server could not even be bothered to get a cocktail menu for the ladiesIn our group!* when paying the bill half cash/half credit card you would have thought we'd asked for the servers first born childFor the reaction we got!*when we did pay the bill with 10% service included the server was obviously unhappy with lack of additional tip. You don't get a tip for terrible service and attitude, you're lucky we paid the 10%!Overall the ONLY thing this bar has going for it is 500 feet (500 feet higher than every other bat in Singapore!) apart from that it is he worst service I have ever experienced in Asia and I just wouldn'tBother
4
Without a doubt this al fresco bar on the 62nd floor has the best 360 degree view of Singapore at night. We have been several times. S$30 pp to go up which includes a drink from a limited list but really worth every cent. Only one complaint: why are so many tables reserved but with no one sitting at them
2
yes the view is awesome...but the prize of the drinks are just too expensive...
and the mixers are not free flow...not worth.
5
Highest rooftop bar in the world. Go in a group of 5-6 so that you can get your entry covered when you buy a bottle. It can get you a table and amazing views.
5
The highest building in Singapore with good music and a nice view ! A bit pricey the entrance fee (35 SGD), but for a good time with friends and party.
5
Great bar upstairs outside but not so good inside. The bar is higher than any other in Singapore and allegedly Asia but I'm still checking. Very good, not too crowded and great great great views.
4
Was there last week the view from the bar top was amazing as usual and we can actually see the MBS light show from there. it was really impressive.
5
360 degree view of Singapore in a very popular spot! For golden oldies, best to go early to relax, enjoy the atmosphere and chill out. Go late and stand in line if you are aiming to hit the party scene. Cool local doods and gals in abundance
3
Great view. That's about it. Not to say that's anything to scoff about. It really is a very grand view of the skyline of Singapore. But everything else is kind of blah. Nothing negative, really. Average service, average finger food, average band playing (at times). Not much of a vibe, although there was a little bit of dancing
4
The place has a beautiful angular view point of the city with good lighting around. Its kind off loungish so you can take breaks and sit down for selfies. The party scene starts about midnight so don't go too early unless you wana pre-drink and snack a bit with friends
5
Nothing beats this 360degree view on Singapore in a nice breeze with a good drink in your hand and excellent life music. Even the entry fee is with 30$ not really a bargain, but at least you get the first drink included, but it's an amazing place to chill out and look down from the tallest building in Singapore to e.g. The Marina Bay Sands Hotel. Don't miss the laser show at 8 pm or 9:30pm, which you can watch nicely from there. The thin crust pizzas are great for a good price and the band they have up there is really great with a fantastic singer. Go there right at the opening at 6pm to still have daylight to see Singapore from the top
3
Gallery & bar at 1-Altitude is a highest rooftop bar in Singapore. We can enjoy 360 degree view of Singapore. We also can view of Singapore when we gathering at here. The food and drink are still okay. That can let us so enjoy and relax
4
If you are going there for views , it would be a good choice. Good for small to medium size gathering / party .
4
Gallery & Bar at 1-Altitude is the highest rooftop bar in Singapore. We can enjoy 360 degree view of Singapore.
5
The view is par excellence. Go there in the evening just before the sun set and enjoy as the sun goes down.
5
It's a beautiful bar, located high above the CBD of Singapore. Very good ambience and courteous folks attending to your needs and drinks! Well priced drinks and good selection of bites. Great place to visit!!
2
Very Small place, it could get very very crowded during peak season, hardly able to walk around the location.
4
Very nice ambiance but the windows could be cleaner. Food was only mediocre though the pasta dishes were quite well done.
5
This is a great place to take in a lovely evening in Singapore. The views are fantastic, the breeze cooling, and the Singapore Sling delicious!
3
Meal was alright. Nothing fancy. Probably because it was a packaged lunch for about 150 paxs.The view is amazing. You can see forever. There is Marina Sand, Sea View, City view. 360 degrees view. If you bring your bino, you can probably see Batam Island, Indonesia.Being the highest restaurant in the world, I believe the A la Carta menu should be good. It has an international menu. Excellent for a romantic quiet dinner for 2.Be prepared to pay though it is worth 'the once in a lifetime experience'
4
This one is at 62nd floor and then two more floors to the terrace. So actually it's at 64th Floor and as we can imagine the view is just awesome! You can see the SkyDeck of Marina Bay Sands below. The cover charge is a bit high. Good service, but not to be remembered for Food
5
I went with my wife one Saturday night to grab a bite and some drinks and we had a great time.All the tables at the top floor have the view of the city so font worry about the location just ask for one there.The food and drinks are really good and not that expensive.was a lot of young people so you could feel a good vibe and the music was also really good....we ended up having a great time
2
Great DJ (Lindo Martinez) who really sets the mood for sunset, view is spectacular but don't expect much in terms of service or properly mixed cocktails.
5
Very good bar,frendly staff,good drink,cheap price,we have been there twice,would love to come back again next time
4
Drinks are drinks anywhere - but the views here are stunning/awesome/ amazing.
It gives a completely perspective and appreciation of Singapore; especially at night when the city and the Singapore River looks stunning with all the lights and neon and the traffic.
Awesome
5
Love this place!! Stunning view, good drinks, friendly staff and good live music. A must to visit if you are in town! :-)
4
we loved the spectacular view and cool atmosphere.
enjoyed a funky jazz band.
the food wasnt outstanding and probably overpriced but not relevant to the overall experience.
recommended for special occasion
4
This is said to be the tallest building in Singapore and must say that the view is great. It is in the open and even the evenings in Singapore can be warm.
Like most things, we found the experience good, but price high.
4
we went here for a business lunch and chat and it was just the ticket - absolutely brilliant views of the marina and shipping lanes and out to wooded unspoilt low lying islands; the food was well presented and tasty if slightly unWOW given the way the restaurant otherwise presented itself but take the dessert buffet option as that is really impressiv
5
Me and My 3 other friends had awesome time here. We went on a Friday without reservation but yet we waited 10-15mins and got in. You need to pay 30SGD in adavance dt comes with one drink. The service was good, we asked them to take our pics, staff was very helpful cleaning tables and let us comfort. The view is speechless. Highly recommended to come here and see the nightlights. you can see a picturesque view of Marina bay sands hotel, Singapore flyer , bayfront and the Harbor. Pretty awesome thing to do. I think this is the highest bar in Asia so why not cheering from on top. Cheers to good life
3
The view is pretty great. The location is promising and the decor and layout of the bar is lovely. However. The crowd on the Friday night i visited it was pretty old and primarily made up of tourists and some expats. The food was good. but a little pricey. The drinks were just as pricey. I don't think ill be returning anytime soon.
4
The view is awesome ! The drinks are good ... There is a cover charge of SGD 30! If you are looking for a casual night out and want to enjoy drinks ( especially the very cold Heineken) visit the ALT bar and cafe on the ground floor !!! Enjoy !!!
5
Great views. definitely a must see. Higher than the MBS Skypark and cooler.....what else can I say..?
5
Go to Number 1 Altitude, the highest alfresco dining in the world. 84 floors high and fabulous uninterrupted views over downtown Singapore. Live entertainment as well. A perfect finish to a day.
4
The stunning view from the roof top bar at the 64th(?) floor at night is magnificent. You can see all of Singapore from there and a some of the Malaysia. Definitely worth the visit.
1
$30 to get in the door and for one drink is pretty overpriced. The furniture was glowing and caused harsh reflections on the glass. The drinks were over priced and the bathrooms were disgusting. I was very disappointed.
3
Been there a few times since I work in the area but.. its just a bar. View is OK but after 10 mins, you need something else to keep you happy. The service is average and I dislike queuing. It is rather small and can gets crammed and noisy on peak days. Not exactly the place to go if you just want a quiet drink with a view. In fact the view is considered "blocked" in the face of neighbouring buildings... There are better rooftop bars in SG
3
If you managed to get to the top will be wonderful but most of the time you won't get up there unless you reserve a table and it will cost you S$1K deposit for table reservation only. If is a summer period (May-July) you will feel sweaty as is open concept and year end (rainy season) is closed most of the time as you can't get to the top
3
I don't go there frequently but have been there number of times. Sinice 2011 to 2015 I visited the restaurant about 5 times. I love the view and the food but their staff at the entrance and service crew at the restaurant itself should work on their services a bit more harder. Be a bit more friendlier and more sensitive towards their visitors.

1 Altitude is not open every day, because it is open air on the top of onde of the tallest buildings in Singapore.So it is closed in inclement weather. But it is a happening place, not just because of the view (which over the harbour, and the fireworks from other tall places is spectacular). But the music is great too, and the drinks prices are not outrageous for the setting. Best as a couple or in a partying group

Loved it and keep coming back every time I'm in Singapore. They insist on a minimum $100 spend but the views of Singapore at night plus the funky venue make it worth every Singapore dollar. Don't bother eating there. The food is modest at best. But you are not there for the food. We encountered a groovy jazz band on the Friday night
2
SG$30 to get in including a single drink, held in a queue even though the place is empty, when we arrived we were channelled to a bar with one bartender while 5 other bar tenders were chatting behind another bar. They know you'll come because it's advertised everywhere and when you come who cares if you are serviced well because there will be more behind you. Great view, glad I saw it I guess, couldn't wait to leave as soon as I'd finished my drink and would never return
5
The view is fantastic. We were there before and after sunrise. You really must see the view in both times.
The rating is for the view, not necessarily the food.
5
This is considered to be one of the highest alfresco (in the open air) Bar. views of Singapore from this bar is just amazing. The DJ did a good job with music. I would like to visit again on my next visit to Singapore.
4
A restaurant that gives you an amazing high due to its height! The DJ is really good, fun place to be with friends. the view is very beautiful!
4
I had a bottle of wine and a meal. The food was ok, the wine was good, the view is stunning.
The service was very slow and it needs improving
5
Really enjoyed the Sundown affair. This is the perfect way to unwind after a long day and get ready for the night
5
Had dinner at this restaurant with hubby. What an amazing place. The food was divine! We had the prawns and pork as main course. Each one better. Service was great too, very polite, attentive and friendly staff.We had entree (scallops) , two main courses and dessert and a bottle of wine!! Was a great night. Not the cheapest place to go but if you want to have an unforgettable memory from your trip to Singapore that's the place to go.After dinner we had a cocktail on level 63 OMG a TO DO list for anyone visiting Singapore !
5
Worth going there and spending time for a couple of hours. Very well done up. Except that the music sound has to be kept down. Too hard on your ears. Hope they do it next time I visit.Nothing else to complain. Scope for customer service improvement is there
5
First visit to Altitude with a group of 16 friends. Food was superb and the 311 view spectacular. We had the set menu which started with an amuse-bouche followed by entrees of salmon on toast, sun dried tomatoes on a crisp pastry and foir gras. The salmon and tomato were great and my friends tell me the FG was rich and filling. The lobster soup was devine but the best art of the meal was the tender beef served with a jerusalem artichoke refined sauce and potatoes. Pudding was simply fabulous... a selection of pomegranate granita, yogurt creme brûlée, some sort of ice cream & baked alaska
4
The view from the top of this open air bar is unrivalled in Singapore I think. You have to pay to get in, and drinks are not cheap, but the view is worth it. It is quite difficult to get a seat unless you book well in advance though (at least that was our experience) and when we got up to the top most tables were reserved, but it is definitely worth doing for sunset during a stop in Singapore
5
You may feel a little aggrieved at having to pay to get into this bar, but don't be put off. As soon as you get you, you will realise the fee was worth paying. The bar is open air on two levels. The lower level consists of a central bar; and then upstairs you have the 360 degree views of Singapore. Great bar, great music and great atmosphere. Not to be missed if you're you're in Singapore.
5
Had a very nice birthday lunch with the wife,the steak and the service was just great the staff service was first class.ad they make a very nice gin martini
5
We came for a birthday drink/ food with 20 people. The view was amazing the best in town. The service was great and the music was good too. We had a fantastic time.

We moved to Singapore a year ago, and we are still trying to get out and about to see everything that is Singapore. This city is so vibrant and there’s so much to see and do here. In some cases it’s much easier if you are a tourist on holidays your time is yours for the most part. Work doesn’t get in the way. We try and get out and do something new at least once a week. This week we took ourselves to The Altitude rooftop Bar/Lounge. What Amazzzzzzzzing, simply stunning views 63 floors up. On one side you have unobstructed views of Marina Bay Sands and on the other you have breathtaking views of down town Singapore and if your lucky, a magnificent sunset (weather permitting). We arrived right on opening time, 6pm ready for the sunset and left about 10pm. Also we rang and booked ahead and was given a table for 2 that overlooked the city toward the Fairmont Hotel. There was no cover charges just a minimum spend of $100per person and that’s not hard to do with drinks and food.The staff & service was fantastic. We went on a Thursday night and they had an excellent covers band playing! The live music was awesome.I thought that the drinks were well priced for this kind of venue and they have a widespread food menu. We had the Satay Sticks and the bacon & egg pizza was to die for. It was so good we’re going again next week! Who knows maybe if I ask nicely the chef may give me the recipe If you only have time to do one thing in Singapore, (weather permitting) it’s worth a look
4
Scared of heights?? Definitely not the place to go unless you are ok spending the evening in the indoor club located on the 61st floor - which is fairly decent with good music but the rooftop bar/lounge on the 63rd floor is breathtaking!! Fabulous music, stunning views and good service make it one of the better rooftop bars in Asia and it's the highest in Singapore! Take the VIP pass for both the club and rooftop bar which includes 2 drinks per person(SGD 45 per head)!! Definitely a place worth going back to!
4
the views are amazing at sunset and enjoyed my time there with a good friend. $30 to go up we thought was a bit steep but as it would be a 1 of thing it was ok. I was drinking tiger bottles around $15 to $18 a bottle very exy , friend was drinking vodka $25 a glass take your visa, we had some snacks were ok. But well worth a look to say you've been
5
I've been here a couple of times already, and I have to recommend it.The view is just gorgeous; Some fridays they also have live music, which adds to the ambience.Beer and drink prices are what you'd expect from a place up on the 61st floor. Anyway, go up, get yourself a beer, gaze at the view and enjoy the music.A sure place to take anyone who's just arrived to SG
5
Get on a guest list...$30 pp, but the views are stunning!! Nice chilled atmosphere with views across Singapore and to Indonesia and Malaysia. Drinks prices as you would expect, but some great memories with great people. Plan your trip around the local weather, they will close the area if it rains or thunderstorms about
3
The view at its best, as it is one of the highest bars in Singapore which is at 61st floor. The cover charge includes one drink which u can linger on while u enjoy the view; The Sunset view from this pub is something which i would recommend (6 - 8 pm) and then head out for a nice restaurant or a disc to spend the evening
5
Originally I was hesitant about heading to Altitude as I'm not great with heights, but I've got to say I am glad I went! We paid $30 each, which includes a free drink. You travel up to the 62 floor where there is a restaurant, then into another lift to travel the last floor to the alfresco bar. The views are incredible. We timed it perfectly and managed to have some drinks whilst watching the sun go down. The 360 degree views are spectacular and the atmosphere was beautiful. Would certainly recommend to anyone visiting, great way to see Singapore.
5
Best view of marina bay. It may have been luck but we found the staff to be fine when there and the atmosphere was laid back with a live band on. The view is the attraction though. Try to get there just before dusk and get a good seat.
5
Amazing view of Singapore (we went at night time for a couple of drinks)! Well worth the money and free drink included.
4
$30 to get in but we thought it was worth it to see the view. And it was a really amazing view. I would definitely recommend doing this if you're visiting Singapore. $30 gets you a free drink and drinks in Singapore are expensive anyway so it didn't really bother us! The annoying thing is they don't let you sit at the tables unless you spend a minimum amount of money. We were only staying for the one drink so we didn't do that
5
A must visit when you're in Singapore whether for clubbers or not.The view is unparallel in Singapore (better than Ku de ta), as you can also view the Marina Bay Sands and the city view on the other side.Drinks and nice and food also up to it, though a tad expensive, but its a top of Singapore experience
5
I was really pleasently surprised by Altitude Bar, having been to sky bars in the past I feel over charged and the service is terrible - not here - the service was great, staff were welcoming, and although entry is $28 ~£14 you get a drink included which is pretty good value considering you're gaining entry to the tallest building in Singapore. The views were incredible, it was a clear night and we could see for miles as Singapore was all lit up.The music was really good, one of the best DJ's I've heard in a while, and the atmosphere was equally good. I'd absolutely recommend this bar, it was a great evening. One tip - if you want a table, ensure you reserve in advance as they were all taken when we arrived.
3
A breath taking view. We got there around dusk and provided with the pretty view of Singapore. And I liked it even better after dusk when the city lights were on. Lovely atmosphere...and it would be a lot lovelier if the the staffs would've smiled more :). I seriously didn't see a smile from every single staff there. They should be aware that they work in hospitality industry, not in a library :
5
A real find in Singapore!The 1-Altitude Bar, 63 floors above Singapore, proudly boasts that it is the highest open air bar in the southern hemisphere.It is stylish, chic and grooving to cool dance music on a Friday and Saturday nights.The crowds are young, cool, well-dressed locals and expats.The cocktails are good and the crowd behaviour is relaxed.The music and attitude are excellent.The views are fantastic.Be cool and enjoy a night overlooking the city State
4
My boyfriend surprised me by taking me to 1-Altitude for the evening. I was completely surprised when I found out that the bar was at the very top of the tower overlooking the entire city. In fact, I loved it so much that I was quite disappointed with the views when we went to the Skydeck in Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The evening was wonderful and most of the staff were attentive. It must be said that some of the staff could smile a bit more and not look like they're forced to work there. The bar snacks that we ordered (the bread with various dips) were lovely and went well with the bottle of Moët we had. The seating was perfect as we were by the glass railing, however, it would have been nicer if the glass was cleaner because the view of Singapore would have been even more spectacular. We were a little disappointed by the fact that the dress code was not enforced. We saw a sign on the door, prior to entering, stating the dress code, but throughout the night we saw women in yoga clothes who looked like they had just came from the gym, men in flip flops, and just very casual wear.Overall, our experience at 1-Altitude was fantastic and we will go back for a drink next time we are in Singapore
5
When in Singapore you must go here to see the amazing views over Singapore. granted it is a little bit expensive but I do think it's worth it. We went up just before sunset and had about an hour up there. The music is chilled and the drinks are nice. The skyline at night is spectacular. Not one to miss!
4
It is impossible to find a better place for the city view in Singapore. Marina Bay, Singapore Flyer, Singapore River, Fort Canning Park, St Andrew's Cathedral, etc, all the famous sights in your eyes. The best time be there is about 6 pm, you can see the sunset, and around 7:30 pm, the night view is best. I don't want to talk about the drinks, because it was not worth the price, but the view really is. No need to book a table, unless you have enough budget. Just walk in, have a beer, talking freely. Enjoy it
3
Great view of singapore from asias highest outdoor bar. however, drinks are expansive, and the facilities and toilets are basic for a place wanting to pitch itself so highly.There were a lot of wannabees there as well as high class hookers. Its probably nicer to go in the day, but the view at night is great.What else is there to say, wna tthe view- go. want a decent bar? dont go
3
Was there to celebrate bday. Loud music, drinks, light refreshment = chillax. A bird eye view of singapore, little red dot. Very windy and the height does matter. Very relaxing and cooling.
4
There is no comparison for views from this rooftop terrace bar, especially at dusk! Unfortunately we happened to visit the place just before thunderstorm so we were all escorted back down quite fast to safety but it was still worth it.
5
My husband and I visited 1 Altitude in December and it was an amazing experience. Attentative staff, tasty cocktails and breathtaking views. Totally worth the $30 entrance fee.
5
Breathtaking view of Singapore from 1-Altitude ! Great place for hangout & enjoy the view of Singapore. It is the tallest alfresco bar in the world! Love the DJ who play the music and also love the live music.
5
1 Altitude is a must visit place if you in Singapore, went there just for dridrinks not the cheapest of plaplaces but well worth it. Atmosphere and the views are outstanding as well as great music, good service and nice crowd
5
We went to 1-Altitude with my friends and it was an amazing experience. The view is amazing totally worth the entry. Don't forget to take your cameras.
Highly recommended.
1
On 13 january we went to one altitude this place got a very good scenery , the music is awesome aswell. That night they closed at 2 am . So at 1.45 they started to chase everybody out, i heard one of the guy near the lift said "mayat2 pada mau turun" in malay means the corpses are goin down . And i feel that is so rude , he seems shocked when we know that we understand malay language, then he started to talk polite english. That one guy told his other colleague that we understood and when we inside the lift and when the lift are goin down hes other colleague are kicking the lift door like he want to kick us , we can see it because the lift door are made of glass and transparent. I think its very rude what the crew of one altitude did that night, i was in shocked. how come one altitude didnt know about its employee behaviour towards its customer, and they need to do something about them.

This bar on the roof top of Singapore highest building has a great potential, but somehow doesn't deliver the experience that it should.Yes, it has the greatest views of Singapore, but what else?The music is too loud and not that good. The deco is minimal, and the service is very poor at best. We ordered 2 bottles of liquor and it took slightly over 30 minutes to be served. The person pretending to be the manager came back with non-sense excuses...If you go there for the view, then yes, this is definitely a good choice especially just before sunset.If you go there for the party / atmosphere, then you have much better options. One opposite on the 57th floor for example..
5
The rooftop bar is a must visit place when travelling to Singapore. The entry fee of SGD30 includes one complimentary drink (alcoholic/non-alcoholic). The food is good. However the best part is the view. One can walk around the whole roof and hence get a 360deg view from the highest building. I would recommend to plan a visit such that you can enjoy the view during the daylight and the dark. Both are spectacular
5
We went to the bar, the restaurant and the rooftop bar. All were AMAZING! The view was sensational and the food to match.The staff were extremely friendly. We found the food well priced for the quality. Could not recommend this place enough. Great atmosphereWe had the bread basket, oysters and cold meat plate to start. For mains we shared the 3 meat plate. Very impressed with all of it
5
For 30SGD entry with one drink include, this is a real good way to see Singapore from one of the highest viewpoints.
The roof garden is real cool with spectacular 360deg views.
Remember to take your camera for this or you will be peeved.
Enjoy
5
This place was recommended by a local, it was exactly as he described. We went on ladies night (possibly a Wednesday, you will need to double check) ladies get free entry but have to buy their own drink, where as the boys pay in and get a free drink. Amazing views, there was a thunderstorm which lit up the entire sky. I will definetly be back, drinks are expensive tho, so sip on one or two, enjoy the views and head to cheaper bars
5
A very good restaurant one level below the highest outdoor bar, affording superb skyline views. We were treated to a private dining room with a delicious menu and some very decent French wines. Overall a special place, even higher than Ku De Ta, albeit slightly more formal. A good experience
4
Described as the highest al-fresco bar in the world at 282 metres. This bar has a 360 degree view of Singapore as you sip your cocktail outside at the very top of the building. Trees and plants abound in this outdoor bar together mood lighting lending a surreal aspect.If storms are rumbling around then the bar will be closed with the exception of a small indoor area.The cocktails are not cheap, but let's face it you are not there just for the cocktails. A Singapore Sling will set you back S$22.The best time to go is a little before dusk and watch night fall on the scene
2
The only thing this place has going for it is the view, which is probably the best in Singapore, it towers above the wheel and Marina Bay. Unfortunately the surly staff and brainless thumping music detract from the experience. Even early in the evening when the place was half empty they had to act as if they were Presidential Secret Service and made us wait to get in, you have to pay $30 a head to get in, but it does include one beer, glass of wine or weak cocktail. This place is in Singapore, not Bad Boys 2, they really need to grow up.Notwithstanding the above, the view is great, so if you can filter out the "security" on the lift, suck up the cost and see Singapore from 63 floors up, if you can handle heights
5
1 Altitude is located right in the center of the CBD on the top of the OUB centre. With its 360 degree viewing options, you have a phenomenal range of sights to devour, including the Marina Bay Sands! The drinks are understandably very very expensive but the music and crowd are awesome. If you pre drink a bit and arrive there, you will surely have a great time
3
The 1-Altitude bar is justifiably the world's highest al-freso bar. The high speed lift whisks you there in no time and the top floor deck provides you with some fantastic views. It is definitely a "must do", if only for the view. Went on a weekday with a local friend and didn't find it crowded at all. Drinks are expensive and we avoided any
5
A visit here will stay in my memory forever. Caught up with friends I've not seen in years. The highest rooftop bar in the world combined with great company, a nice selection of bar snacks and drinks, and very attentive staff make a superb combination. A true bucket list place
1
We had the most unpleasant experience at 1altitude and it should be called Bad Attitude!I had written to the General Manager,Ian Sim thinking I would get a response and it would probably be a cold day in hell if he does reply!Here's what I wrote to-Dear Mr Sim,I am writing to air my complaints about the very poor service that my friends and I'd received at 1Altitude on the 1st of Nov 2014.There were 11 of us in the group and we decided to hold a going away get together for one of the ladies leaving Singapore. We arrived as walk in guests and after asking if we could have a table, we were shown one that didn't have a reserved sign on it.We then enjoyed the view and drinks till we decided to order some food when it got dark.I wanted to request a food menu and called out to your wait staff, Shey. Now even though, she had heard me and had made eye contact, she proceeded to ignore me and went over to one of the other staff to chat!I got out of my seat and approached her and asked her why she had ignored me and her explanation was that she wanted to speak to her friend first.She offered me no apologies and I did say to her as a customer I was offended by her lack of interest in serving me. I then asked if I could see her manager. She walked off and as I sat down, I could hear her say that she needed our table and we could all get out!! We then asked another wait staff for a menu and also requested to see the manager. Erwin came by and asked what we would like to order but we said that we wanted to complain about Shey's poor attitude. He apologised but made no attempt to do anything else till my friend suggested he go and talk to Shey.We waited and even though, he had finished chatting to her. Neither of them approached me to follow up on the matter till I approached him. My friends and I said that we had planned to stay but after this debacle,we had no reason to. He did get Shey to apologise to me,again on the suggestion of one of my friends! I said to her that i didn't need her apology and suggested that she didn't work in a service related line since she wasn't interested.It was my first and potentially my last time to 1Altitude!If you need any further clarifications, please email me.I look forward to your response.So go for the views and hopefully, you might get some good service after this review
4
Want to have a romantic date ? or a fun party ? or post office relaxation with colleagues or drinks with clients ? This place will give justice to every need. Superb atmosphere , breathtaking views This is tallest building in Singapore (if I am not wrong) and top most floor is 1-Altotude. Its bit pricey but then its a price you pay to see the world at your feet. Indeed superb experienc
5
This is well worth the money! Breath taking views of the city from the highest open bar in the world. This attraction dwarfs everything around it with clear 360 degree views. definitely a must see if you are Singapore!
5
Been at 1-alt couple times and its always a great place to go. The ambience is super cool and the view is simply amazing specially in a nice and clear night. The DJ is super good so always sure of a good time out there.
5
We were told this is the worlds highest bar. Certainly felt like it. Wow the views were amazing. Singapore by night, you can see right over to Sentosa. There was a small entrance fee for the males but this did include a drink. Females were admitted free. This is a much better bet than paying vast sums to the harbour bars to see the view. 2 lifts to go up. Excellent music and great atmosphere, plenty of seating and clean toilets. Dance floor too. Drinks were a little expensive but what isnt in Singapore. Well worth a visit although we found it quite difficult to find. Even the taxi driver didnt know it so do your homework before setting out. Didnt eat here so cannot comment as dont know anything about the food, if any
5
Unmatched setting, superb terrace area spreading over different levels, good music and fantastic crowd.... 1-Altitude has all the good things to boast about, including good food, drinks, and service.Price is a bit on the higher side though, but this night-out will leave a lasting memory for those who find the night forever young! Go for it!!
1
Yes the facilities are good (outrageous prices) but unfortunately I was only able to enjoy them for about 15 minutes before we were removed from the club without re-entry for "trespassing".If you're going to allow hundreds of people into your club and want to restrict certain parts of the building you should give some sort of former information or at least signs restricting such areas.Some context is probably needed here, 1-altitude has a smoking room which, much like any smoking room is fairly unpleasant in my opinion, hence we wanted to go to an outside area to smoke. We were told that there might be such an area upstairs; how do we get upstairs? Well there's a door with the sign "staircase" on it, let's try that. We then find ourselves approaching another area of the building called Altimate (I presume it is another club they own for the even wealthier), which was apparently restricted to us (unknown to us). One bouncer is suddenly shouting at us asking how we got there, we willingly showed him before he told us we had to go downstairs outside the club to smoke. Absolutely fine with us we were taken down the elevator, but when we were ready to go back inside we find that we aren't allowed re-entry by a new bouncer because apparently we "trespassed".Now usually this would be okay, but the attitude the bouncers have towards their customers is vile and unpleasant, the fact that they can't be understanding with us and simply say we aren't allowed there is ridiculous. Maybe they should think about introducing "staff only signs" or at least some indication that these areas are restricted. And it isn't just the bouncers with the attitude, even the manager was brought down after some arguing and had the exact same pretentious attitude towards us.Needless to say, I will not be spending another cent at this bar/club, giving a terrible impression of Singapore's nightlife
4
The highest bar in Singapore, this bar boasts 360 degree views over the city, and it's gorgeous at sunset (even with the haze of pollution).The cocktails, at $20SG a pop, tasted little more than cordial - maybe just go for a picture opportunity and a glass of water
1
Great views of course but don't expect service with a smile. In fact the staff here haven't a clue about customer service. We arrived at 6.30pm to see the sunset and found that although the place was quiet all the tables for groups were reserved. Eventually we were allowed to sit at a table on the understanding that we vacated when the booking group had arrived (this wasn't until 10pm!). The staff plainly didn't want to do their jobs, we asked for a menu but it never reached us, we tried to talk to the manager but he had no idea how to be a leader or manage his staff. I won't be hurrying back, there are plenty of places in Singapore to have a drink and terrific view
5
This place has unparalleled views of the city. And they have great dj's and good music.On the weekends, there's a sizable entry fee and usually long lines unless you are there very early. The music and crowd and atmosphere is great, but long lines for drinks depending where you are.Staff is friendly enough but the views are absolutely incredible
5
just came back from a visit to Singapore, we spent one night at the amazing Altitude restaurant on top of the UOB building I think, or 1 raffles plaza.the staff were amazing, we were a large group of 16 people (including few kids) the staff were diamonds, even the restaurant manager came and explained few things about their food and meat sources. after the staff took the kids to one room and kept them entertained (that was a nice break) after the amazing food, the staff took us upstairs to the roof to enjoy the amazing views, the whole experience was amazing, and my dad will never forget his 70 birthday, as it went with a bang.finaly a huge thank you for the staff, you realy made it special
5
I love this place, only issue its sometimes too crowded and its not impossible to get a place to sit, I think they take pre bookings I never tried, view is amazing from 1 Altitude, Wednesdays are great ladies night ladies get to go in free and all will get martinis for lesser price, its pretty good early evenings as well around 6 very beautiful open peaceful place with good music.I would definitely recommend this place for a small meeting or with pals. Fun place to visi
5
Loved the views and the cocktails! I wish I had honestly stayed there longer. The servers were nice and the cocktails were to die for. Going back, for sure!
2
Yes the view is fantastic. Can't say service was bad, it was INEXISTANT! And price is insane. $30 for one drink! Come on people, the view is as good from kudeta and at east u get some service !
Stay away From 1- Altitude
4
The view is everything! The furnishings are cheap & tacky, the walls need painting, glass needs cleaning & toilets need a thorough clean. Really expected more! Sky 57 & Ku de Ta is by far superior!
Attentive staff .
4
Went there last night, and as I walked in and up the staircase to where you can see the views from, I was astounded by the views. Never been to a place quite like it. You can walk all the way around, and in the distance, it is possible to make out Malaysia to the north, Indonesia to the south, and Singapore right below. I guess one of the few bars in the world where one can enjoy views of three countries. The drinks were expensive but also large, and the atmosphere very upbeat. The music was a tad loud for me, but had a thoroughly good time there, especially so as it wasn't crowded and could get a table with a view. Definitely should be on the 'to do' list for Singapore for anyone who likes awesome views and can tollerate loud music. Maybe it is quieter in the daytime
4
Well worth a visit if you can make it happen during a stay in Singapore. It took us a few attempts given the weather can shut down the Bar.However, a great beginning to an evening out. The views are spectacular, especially in the evening. It is crowded and for people like me who like to settle in, hanging around at the edge of an incredibly elevated bar has a limited appeal. I wouldn't go back, but am glad I went once
5
When in Singapore, you have to visit this place. The view from the edge is simply wow. I was here on the first night I arrived at Singapore. It was a Friday night. The music was great. The food was just fine. Try and secure a table at the edge as you get an uninterrupted view of the Singapore skyline
5
Had an amazing time at the One Altitude Bar. The view is fantastic. We had been at the Ku de ta the night before and could look down on it from this venue. Very fun, dance floor is busy and everyone seemed to be having a great time. We went on both a Saturday and a Wednesday (ladies night so ladies get in free) and had a great time both nights. The drinks are a bit pricey but they give you one free drink with the cover charge. Worth the price for such an amazing view
5
You have to experience this bar for the best of Singapore. A great place to view sunset over Singapore while relaxing with friends. Beware of the dress code and ladies day gives her free entrance. It might be expensive but worth every dollar. Will visit every time I get to Singapore
4
I have been here a few times for pre-dinner cocktails with business colleagues. The first time was really impressive, especially on a clear night. The views are truly breathtaking. Sometimes they have live music. The band was pretty good last time I was there, so it was a nice evening to sit and relax over a few drinks.But honestly, this is not something you really need to do more than once
5
My colleague took me to the rooftop bar and it is simply an amazing place to have some drinks and enjoy the evening air. We arrived soon after they opened and well before dark and had the opportunity to grab seats and otherwise roam around as we pleased. After about an hour or so, the live music (which was nice) started and it got busier and it was harder to move around and find a seat, as you may expect.Yes, the drinks are very expensive and although there is no obligation to buy further drinks after the initial one to "get in", there is some unspoken pressure to get you to continue to spend money. That said, it wasn't overly annoying and somewhat understandable. The price is also not terrible considering I paid similar amounts for drinks at one of the outdoor pubs on the river below.The view of Singapore, as well as surrounding countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, etc.) are stunning and if you arrive like we did while it is light and then evening slips in, you'll experience a beautiful transformation of the landscape
4
The food on 1-Altitude is very good and combining that with the view from the restaurant gives an incredible experience. But the best part is the roof bar. We experience the roof bar just before sunset which makes it an even better view. Highly recommendable.
5
63 floors up with views in every direction this is just the most amazing roof top bar i have been too. Take a few extra dollars with you for drinks but it is worth every penny.

definitely a nice view as on one of the highest buildings in Singapore and interesting atmosphere, but it comes with a big price tag. There are many other buildings in Singapore with a view - is it worth to spend about 60 SGD for two quite lousy drinks? Bar staff was fokussed on cashing in money, not on guests and service. And ladies, do not think that you get a special treat on Ladies Night, it is just no entrance fee, but you still have to pay for your drinks
4
Most of rhe reviews are about the city view you get to see, and it is really very nice to have a 360 view of Singapore at such heights. Even the iconic MBS is in view. Food overall tasty, but as a high end bar & restaurant, do expect a high end price tag as well. But if you are just visiting for a view - yes, it is wortht the price. Where else can you get a 360 unobstructed view of the cityscape?Do note of the cover charges and best to reserve prior to avoid suprises

We went to the rooftop as we booked a table at the restaurant (therefore, no charge applies). The place could be better (not a lot of seating, there are organized in range, fence has a frame which blocks the view a bit…) but the view is must see ! Beautiful ! Experience it at sunset, or anyway I think the atmosphere is better at night. Drinks at not cheap (knowing that you have to pay a fee to enter…) but let's close our eye on it… and open them to the scenic view on the roof of Singapore ! Nota: mind the weather forecast 
5
Partying on the 63rd floor with 360 degree view, is definitely a high. An entrance charge of $30 per person is acceptable for the view and experience. The music is good, the ambience is nice, mostly standing with very less chances of finding seats, but you won't mind. Every penny spent keeping in view the experience is worth it.The night I went there, it was the National day of Singapore and a lot of fire crackers were lit in celebration. For the first time in my life I was looking down to the fire crackers and that made me feel the height I was standing on to view it all. A must go for couples who want to party.....
5
At first I thought it's a night club here, but when I took the elevator up to the 63th floor, it turned out a great lounge bar. The view is just way too awesome and you could see everything around without any barrier. There's a live band here as well
3
It's claimed as the highest building in Singapore. With 360 degrees view roof top bar, you can enjoy city lights and nice breeze. Drinks are standard-nothing spectacular, service is nice, music is good but mostly old chart collection.I went there many times, but unfortunately got disappointed particularly by the DJ last night. I was there for a special occasion with a big group of friends, and I requested for a song. I had been told by the staff that DJ gonna play it, but after half an hour of waiting, it didn't happen. So I asked again nicely to the staff to check with DJ.. And again he said I had to wait for the next DJ to spin and he will play the song I requested. After 45 minutes of waiting, I looked for the manager and he was kind enough to whisper my request to DJ's ear. Another 30 minutes of waiting DJ still didn't spin the requested song. Then the staff said DJ didn't accept any request at all.. Both DJ looked very arrogant too.To me it was really disappointing, as I chose to spent a special night and spent not little money there and DJ didn't even entertain for ONE request ONLY. If it was the protocol or rules or system, whatever they call it..., they could have told me since the beginning of my request so I didn't have to wait and felt disappointed in the end.No wonder even on Friday night like last night, the place wasn't really crowded. Perhaps there is one or other reason, but certainly I have story to share with family, friends & colleagues as a disappointed customer

There's no denying that the view from the bar is spectacular. Without it, I don't think anyone will ever come here; I'd certainly won't.-The drinks were meh: I can mix better at home.-Service is terrible: There were waiters going around bumping to you without apologising and I'm not even sure what they're doing (certainly not serving nor clearing tables).-Layout of the place is uncomfortable: There are seats by the edge where you can view the skyline of Singapore, but these are for people who order drinks by the bottle. For those who only by individual drinks, there are seats near the bar and dance floor which are inconvenient for talking with the music blasting and the "views" are not pleasant (drunk people dancing without a care).-Floors are made out of uneven wood planks, making it uncomfortable -even dangerous- to walk in high heels.Ladies can come in for free on Wednesdays (Ladies' Night) but no free drinks, while the guys must pay $30 entry fee (1 free drink). I came in a clear day that I can have the view of the whole Singapore. With Singapore's weather so unpredictable, I can't imagine coming here on a rainy day. Totally not worth it
5
Short queue and we thought the $30 entrance price was OK as it included free cocktails. Whooshed up in the lift as views from the window flickered past like a movie strip. Once at the top it was a real WOW moment. Cocktail in hand we watched the sun go down as we marvelled at the Singapore architecture and reclaimed land which is the Marina Bay area. Helpful staff took photos for us and we stayed for another whilst listening to the excellent music from the brilliant band
5
This is a super place to be an observation deck especially at night. Good music and nice people too. Had a great time there!
4
Wow..Check out the entire city of Singapore from the top. Amazing ambience...but they close at the slightest hint of rain.
5
The real estate sitting on 63rd floor with the claim of being the world's highest alfresco bar was the main draw and the view did not disappoint but what really lifted the experience was some amazing music and pretty good ambience & service. We were there just for drinks and they mixed decent cocktails and the price was ok given the USP
2
I shouldn't be using others' words but the expression used previously, by someone, that "we were ushered like cattle" is what better depicts the attitude of the welcoming team, down at the entrance. Some ill-tempered ladies put you in a row where, before you know it, have to select and pay the drink that you'll have at the top... Still in the row you are directed, mostly using signal language signs and little conversation, to the lift. Once at the top, there are no tables available except if you reserve them in advance. Even if there are empty ones - as it was the case - you are not entitled to them...The view though is superb but not worthwhile the sacrifice! Equinox service is much better and even Ku De Ta - with also a superb view - has a better service
5
everything here is amazing from the view, drinks, music to the staffs. Worth for a tourist to spot the observation on the top level. I had great time here and done tons of shooting also. You only got to pay 30 SGD for entrance, and should be considerable
2
Upon arriving within 5 mins we were ushered like cattle from the rooftop down several flights of stairs (due to 'bad' weather brewing) although the night looked perfect. We then had to sit in a nightclub atosphere and pay $20 per drink after AlsoPaying $30 for entry to see the view ! Very disappointing . If we had known he rooftop was closing we would not have entered.
5
Amazing vistas from this rooftop bar in downtown Singapore. The cover charge of $30 is steep but includes a cocktail, which as anyone who has had a night of drinking in high end places in this city knows, is par for the course. The 360 degree views are fantastic and the rooftop occupies an area the size of a football field. There is a DJ playing tunes, the bar is relatively accessible and it's worth a nighttime visit
5
This bar was amazing - apparently it is the tallest alfresco bar in the world and the views definitely reinforce this.It is a popular spot so despite being busy it is quite a chilled environment with sofas and good music..It is quite expensive as you have to pay a cover charge (which includes one drink) upon entry but this costs approximately. Â£10 so definitely worth it and a really nice way to spend an evening looking out over the city.Everyone that goes to Singapore should visit this bar
5
We went here as a couple with friends and had a great night. It was a Sunday night and so pretty quiet, it was also quite late but it was a clear night and so landed itself to great views down over the city and marina Bay sands. The roof top bar is larger than Ku Da Ta bar and also higher and in my opinion, provides a better view as you get to look down over marina Bay sands and the City. Marina Bay sands really being the stand out building in Singapore, if your stood on top of it, you can't see it. There is a nice looking restaurant on floor 62 although we didn't dine, the views from the restaurant looked spectacular. I would say that the target age group for 1-Altitude is possibly a bit younger than that of some establishments only due to the music choice (more club) and volume, that said, there were all ages up there enjoying the ambience. I would recommend to anyone visiting Singapore and we will be back with friends when they visit.
5
Amazing views from the highest building singapore. It is completely open air so gives the feeling that you are in the sky.Cover charge on entry is pricey but it does include entry and one drink. If the weather is not ideal, the rooftop is closed and you visit the nightclub/bar. The view from indoors is still good but we did not enjoy the nightclub-ish atmosphere, especially in the early evening.Well worth a visit if in Singapore
4
Good place for a nice view! More romantic place for drink! Not too crowd, not bit party - more bar rather club. Recommend to visit at least once to everyone !
5
Absolutely wicked place to go see the views of the city. You really appreciate how large the city is sprawling when u go here. Price is alright includes free drink (so make sure u don't order a coke!!). Wasn't as busy as I expected - which was a real bonus. Live music as well which was pretty good, however they blast the heck out of it so would be good if it was a little lower in volume - would make conversations easier. A must do attraction
5
I paid the S$30 to head up on a Sunday night for a quiet drink. Fabulous bar with great views from the open air 63rd floor. Cool breezes on a warm Singapore evening, loads of staff ready to bring you overpriced drinks and food, with a blues band playing. It's really lovely. I understand it gets crowded on Friday and Sat nights, but Sunday was perfect to just chill. Expensive though, the only place I have paid the same price for a full sized pizza or a beer - both $20
5
Booked a table here for 4 people at a reasonable 100SD per person min spend and had the best of times. The views are amazing,even the container ships looked great at night. Couldn,t fault the staff .. friendly, very helpful with the picture taking especially. Dj played some good tunes so it was a night to remember.. Except drunk too much and didn't !! A serious party place for any Singapore visitor.
5
Booked in advance as it might be tricky to get a table later in the night. There is a minimum to spend cover charge but very fair at $100 per person which is no problem to spend in couple hours:)Drinks were ok and food wasnt greatest but who cares after few drinks. With the view including Marina Bay Sands light show I cant complain and you just feel amazed by it all the time. So as long as i have my own sofa on scyscraper roof facing the view, few drinks and snacks on the table I dont think it can get any better than this!Pop in and enjoy. Dont go hungry and dont expect good dining. It is just a bar at the end
1
I was rejected at the door because apparently my *broken leg* didn't meet the dress code!According to security it is possible to 'get a larger pair of dress pants that could fit over my boot' and it would be 'unfair to the other guests' to allow me up with improper dress.Unfair to the other guests?? haha I had to laugh... and so did others in the queue - jumping in to my defence.Unfortunately there was no backing down, rules are rules. No Exceptions

WARNING : Not a place to impress your guest due to poor service. Hope this review is being read by Manager of the club.Please understand it is a DRINKING place thus your staff needs to be more understanding and professional especially a club who displays style. My colleagues and I headed 1-Altitude after our company dinner and dance. Unfortunately 1 colleague of mine had a drop too much and COULD NOT survive the lift pressure, she vomited at the connecting level before another taking the other lift to the rooftop bar. 1 tourist or customer immediately took a pot of plant and covered the 'waste' my colleague created. He was being shouted by 1 of the staff whom starts interrogate him as if he just robbed a bank.Feeling helpless as I was the only one with my colleague, I badly need to know the direction to toliet to clean her up. While trying to stablise my colleague and asking for direction, the staff were only concern over a pot of plant being shifted (yes, very ridiculous)Finally after hard efforts without any assistance of the club, I had sent my drunken colleague on her husband car before reunion with the rest of colleagues. We have about 10 people. Unfortunately, 3 of our tickets were in the pouch of my drunken colleague. I had requested the club manager assistance if we could get our drinks without tickets. There is proof that we had made payment and I could say exactly the drinks which we ordered earlier. The Manager took about 15 mins to verified the transaction and still incapable of making a decision. I told the manager that we have 2 option1) Since there is proof of payment, he could offered the drinks even without drinks coupon2) If he could not do so, I will forfeit the drinks.If we could pay for $30/entry, we are not here to cheat for 3 drinks.The Manager decision? He said: Ok, in that case there will be no drinks without tickets.I am totally shocked at the service level from the floor manager. No doubt the scenery is wonderful but this is of no credit to the bar. In summary, it will be better to drink/dance at other clubs with better service than having beautiful scenic with ugly attitude people. Will not head back or even recommend to my guests

Returned to the 1-Altitude with friends who were on a short stopover in Singapore. Had praised the wonderful panoramic view of Singapore at night to give them an idea on the night of their arrival where to go for sightseeing the next day.However, they only stayed for a short while as the experience was quite negative this time.As their flight had been delayed, we only reached the place on a Friday night around midnight. The queue was fairly long and the staff had difficulties to manage them, especially as some of the people in a group were already under the influence of alcohol and not very disciplined in queuing up. From 4 people ahead of us it went to more than 10 people that were suddenly ahead of us with more trying to squeeze in front. As my guests were already a bit tired from a long-haul flight, this didn't go down very well. The staff did their best to manage the situation and we got up to the bar. The view was as usual stunning and this time it was possible again to go to the edge. However, as it was a Friday night, the music served a different purpose, i.e. it was on 'club level'. Each had one drink and we left the place fairly soon.If you're out for partying, it probably is a great place to be even though the entrance fee of 30 SGD incl one drink is quite steep.If however you are simply there to enjoy the view, choose another day or at least a much earlier time
4
We paid the cover charge. Had two cocktails included. The views are breathtaking at night and probably worth the expense. The staff were lovely. The ambience and lighting are atmospheric. Take pictures and remember the spectacular skyline that is Singapore. An hour worth taking to be on top of the world.Not bad value for money for the vista
5
After living in Singapore for over 5 years, I have visited every rooftop bar here. By far, Altitude has no competition. It has a 360 degree view, some amazing staff and great food. Cost Conscious:For the guys who are cost conscious, get into the bar before 6PM to avoid paying the cover charge. For people getting in after 6PM, you have to pay a cover of 25++ which avails you a drink.They do have some fun nights like ladies nights, bollywood nights where they open up the dance floor for some good times. The food is definitely on the expensive side. For quick bites, you can try their freshly baked bread - sundried with their dips. Lastly, we spent new years eve here. By far, the best lounges to have had such a success. Even though the place was crowded, we had our space and no one was getting into our space. For tourists, if you have not seen 1 Altitude, then you have not seen Singapore
5
First time in Singapore, the bar was recommended by a friend for the view. We paid 25 sing$ entrance fee that included one drink. Walking around, enjoying 360' view while sipping a Singapore sling and the light and laser show at e MBS was a perfect star
1
Good view but very expensive. Extremely rude staff and owner! I paid $700 and i got service that i would value $100 compared to the value Marina Bay Sands offered me earlier in the evening! I wasted my NYE in singapore.. Too sad. However i would recommdend you if u are 3-4 to get an entire bottle of alcohol as individual drinks (which are served in plastic glass are too expensive. Finally, if u get a bottle dont get in the bar as the bartender will get orders from the guy who is trying to order shouting through your girlfriend and friends 1m aWay, giving u absolutely no privacy..
4
The view from the top of the building is amazing especially in a clear night where the lights from nearby buildings and MBS looks very beautiful. The service was great with very pleasant staff. The food was nice although the portions are on a small side
5
because of it's spot on the top building... i think at 68th levels on d building, so u can experienced the highest and scariest things out there. and of course the amazing 360 degrees views of Singapore. u gotta try men.. u never been in Singapore, except u first go to this 1-altitud
4
Not the first roof top restaurant we've been to so the novelty factor not high but it offers spectacular views and well worth for first timers in particular. We were hampered but evening showers so couldn't get up on to the roof for 90 mins which meant drinking expensive beers and wine in the bar on 61 st floor which could have been anywhere. The roof top is tastefully decked out. Its pot luck as to whether you get a live band playing not so loud music or a DJ playing music that can be heard in Jakarta. If a quiet conversation with a partner or friends is what your after, then have a drink and then go somewhere els
5
This bar is located on top of one of the highest buildings in Singapore. Needless to say, the views on the city are amazing. The entrance fee seems to be a little high but because of the cocktail that's included, it's worth it. Good atmosphere. Definitely a must when in Singapore
5
We spent two nights in Singapore visiting friends on our way back from Bali. Our friends took us to this bar not telling us what to expect. They paid the entrance fee which included a drink and we went up in the lift to the 61st floor, then changed lifts up to the 63rd floor. We were taken aback when we stepped out of the lift to see the lights and fantastic buildings of Singapore. The tables were mostly reserved but looked fantastic as they were lit up too. Indonesia and Malaysia were in the distance. It was wonderful sipping a Singapore sling on top of the highest bar in the world with a live band playing. We just stayed for one drink as we were eating somewhere else but I would say don't leave Singapore without visiting this place
5
We had a fantastic experience at 1-Altitude in October 2013, enjoying many drinks and taking in the amazing views over Singapore (with Malaysia and Indonesia visible in the distance) and great music. Thursday nights are recommended to avoid Friday-night crowds. Try and get a table if you can (the reserved signs appear to be negotiable!), it's well worth it
5
The Good =)~Instead of MBS which has a view of Marina Bay,you are looking at MBS, which is more beautiful a sight to admire.~Cheaper than the MBS's KU DE TA.The Bad =(~Crowded during weekends.~Maybe difficult locating the entrance@ UOB PLAZA Ground Floor.My Tip for future visits:~Call early & make a reservation
5
I took some visiting guests to 1-Altitude to really show off the city and atmosphere. I was not at all disappointed. We made sure we got there before 7 to watch the sunset and it was absolutely spectacular. You pay a charge to get in but that includes a cocktail. We went on a Friday and I think we paid $24 entrance and there was no queue so we went straight in. Considering the costs of some cocktails in Singapore that's not too bad. It also stops floods of people going in just to take pictures of the view. You do have a limited menu to choose your first drink from but that wasn't a problem and the cocktails were very nice and definitely strong enough.I was expecting it to be heaving but it wasn't at all. I thought that was quite nice because we were able to find a space and enjoy the atmosphere. All the tables were reserved even though they were not in use at this time so it definitely gets a lot livelier later in the evening. Some staff were walking around offering to take photos which I thought was great because everyone wants a photo of them with that view in the background. Unlike other bars and restaurants in Singapore with a view at 1-Altitude you get to see around 360 as the bar is in the middle and you can walk all the way around the outside.We even had our orders taken and drinks brought to us on a couple of occasions and I'm not sure if the service would be the same when it gets really busy later in the evening. We had a few cocktails and left for a restaurant. I think this place was just perfect for that and I will definitely be taking future guests there
5
It's worth having a drink at 1-Altitude just for the views. The roof-top offers breathtaking views in all directions.
1
Bar altitude has forge my signature in order to double charge me for a order of drinks that the waiter spilled! Absolutely outrages! For such a nice place to attempt fraud! Especially in singapore. Their behaviour was disgusting. I have yet to receive an apology.
4
I was introduced to Altitude by a friend. I am a Singaporean, living overseas, so I need intro to many of such new attractions !!! My friend was right in that we had a memorable experience on Bar at Level 63. It was a clear sky that day, hence no hassles of visibility/rain... The Stewards were considerate, attended to us very well & we felt we got full value for money spent. MUST SEE place for travelers
4
Not to expensive you get the best view of Singapore in a nice ambiance. Been there in the evening, so got the night view too. You can make reservations, but drop inn works too. Finger food and pizza's were good and tasty, however took a while to arrive
5
Best views of Singapore from this rooftop bar.We were in Singapore for the F1 and had had enough of Rihanna so decided to visit this establishment as we could get free entry with our F1 passes and the dress code was relaxed for the weekend so we could go up with shorts n flip flops on.Drink prices were reasonable for Singapore, 34 SGD for a pint and vodka n coke.A must visit place if in Singapore
3
After a lot of confusion with trying to make a booking via email, I took my 2 friends from out of town up to the bar without a reservation. (The emails that I got back were just confusing.) We got a table with no problem and it was a Saturday night. An amazing view and a great way to start an evening out in Singapore
4
Its a place for the beautiful view of the city. After having dinner at Stellar we moved to the bar. The music is not a high point of this place and if you are looking to shake a leg probably you will find other better option in Singapore. But if the idea is to take a view then definately you should be going to this place. The drinks are little pricey but might be worth the vie
5
Cannot imagine where the people who have written negative reviews have been which is better. Breathtaking views, attentive staff, cool atmosphere, live band, prices you'd pay on the ground in Singapore. If you go to Singapore, go here or miss out on a truly memorable place
5
I have been there on Friday, around 8.00pm, paying $30 for a drink. The view is fantastic, for sure the best in Singapore, and in addition there was a very nice breeze. The drink was average but the music (disco) was quite good and some friends of mine enjoyed it at lot dancing all the time.All in all it has been a great experience well worth what we have payed
5
They say is the highest roof top bar, I don t know if it's true but it is definitely wonderful. Good music, amazing 360Â° view, really good drinks... just go and see yourself!We were there on a Monday night so it was pretty empty but was still nice, can't imagine what it could be on a Friday or Saturday night. The staff at the entrance is really rude though
4
Great view from this place. It will cost you to get in but you get a free drink when you pay the entrance fee. It's a really good bar and I highly recommend if you like a late drink in a classy place.
5
I went for one thing, the view. Managed to use my tripod although it is not allowed (Gorillapod). Beers are over prices, but not disproportionately to the view. Fantastic and free to go up, dress smart casual.
4
Nice bar, entry $25 but you can choose a drink (for example a mojito $22). So not really expensive, only when buying a secpnd drink.
5
We went up to viewing deck bar and the views are truly spectacular. It cost 35SD for two cocktails so not badly priced. The night we were there they had a Iive band playing who were very good which added to the atmosphere.In reality though you don't go there for the quality of the drinks or the service it is purely for the view. Worth being up there at 9.30 so that you can watch the Marina Bay Sands light show
4
Best OL bar that I have experience coz of the 360 view deck and the warmth of the servers. But the views are really amazing.Be warned that you might order a lot of drinks. I don't know if they put less alcohol on the drinks or probably its very airy that's why your tipsiness fades away =)Then again its a best place to chill out w/o shouting with each other coz its an open bar thus the music will not be super loud.Downside is if it rains there is no shelter. You need to go down probably 3 levels down and you will stay at the covered bar.All in all, the place is good and you can't beat the view =
1
Monday night....$25 entry with a drink......pre-made and poured from a decanter with not a hint of alcohol.Staff handed the drinks continually to one in the group and watched him struggle to handle 4 drinks in his hand while 4 staff stood behind the bar and 2 in front.Hospitality............look up the definitionLucky you have the view...
5
One of our most favourite things that we did in Singapore! (Family of 4)Went up here about 6.30pm and stayed for 2 hours. It was great watching all the lights come on and the darkness settle on the city.We had nothing but a positive experience. Very friendly reception and welcome at the ground floor. Paid $25 cover charge at the ground floor and fetched our drinks from the bar on arrival. Did not have to pay cover charge for 13 year old. Staff were all friendly and efficient.It is seriously the most amazing view and to be outdoors and able to get a 360 degree view of Singapore is just awesome. We LOVED sitting there in the warm night air sipping drinks and eating. Tables were all reserved but we asked if we could sit and were told we could for a short while but after we ordered pizzas and more drinks we were able to stay at the table for as long as we wanted. We felt it was worth every cent for such a great experience
4
I had been to few popular bars in asia that includes the famous Rock bar in Bali, Sirocco in Bangkok & Vertigo in Bangkok. I must say that the view from 1-altitude to be the best. I dont know why but I found the snacks & cocktails to be just okay for their price. And the waiters were a bit unpolished for such a swanky bar. However the live band was good, view was very nice & cool. A cover charge of S$25 is applicable when you enter the building at the ground floor. It comes with a cocktail. Not bad. The view is breathtaking & 360 degree view lets you witness all sides of Singapore. The seats & the place as such is just okay & not posh but just good enough to hang out. Not royal but a cool place to hsng out
5
Mainly for seeing the best view of Singapore city!! especially when looking out to the bay and Marina Bay Sand was just there!! Absolutely breathe taking view, drinks of course expensive but i was lucky, that night i went there and it was a Daft Punk DJ. Falcon Album party!! so very worthwhile spending there. I would love to go back for party again
5
We took some friends here while they were visiting and this was definitely a hightlight of the trip. The drinks aren't exactly cheap, but the views are amazing, it doesn't seem to get to busy, and you can see the whole of Singapore. The best of the rooftop bars in Singapore in my opinion
4
Instead of paying 20SGD at the Skypark of Marina Bay sands for a view of Singapore's skyline, go to 1Altitude for 30SGD, with 1 drink + view. Music is nice and a good place to meet people.
4
Evening with friends- location is awesome, one of the highest possible rooftop bars in the world at 280 metres. Excellent Sunday evening live music, followed by sadly mismatched cheap dance tunes. Drinks acceptable, but service lousy. Would/ likely will come again for the location.
4
Fantastic views all around - get there at about 6.45pm so you can see the sun go down and experience the wonderful lights of the city.
1
Despite requiring you to pay $25 for the privilege of getting up on the rooftop (which does have great views of the city) only so you can they purchase their overpriced drinks, they then serve all drinks in terrible cheap plastic glasses. And once you are done your drink you will have every single waiter and waitress stop by in the next 5 minutes (so about ten people) to ask if you if you want another drink. Cause they reeeeally want you to buy another drink as soon as you're done your first one. What could be a swank and class lounge is left feeling cheap and tasteless. I highly recommend Level 33 and KuDeTa as much much better options if you're looking for a rooftop lounge for a few drinks with friends
4
We go to visit the bar when it gets windy and the rooftop bar was closed because of the weather. Instead we visit the 282m bar in the 61 storey. In this bar you did Not have to pay the entrance fee of 25 S$. Till 8 p.m. its Happy Hour and the beer costs 10 S$. You do not have a 360Â° view but it is really nice there. The Service Team makes Fotos with us and gave us a nice window place. We spent two hours there, see the light show at marina sands bay Hotel and a thunderstorm. All in all a good place in singapore.
4
What an amazing view and cool place to be. The beginning of the evening was a bit unpleasant, as the team mixed up our reservation. We didn't like the concept: Half of the group is standing, while the rest is sitting and eating. We were 10 people and got provided with 5 chairs first. If you want to book a bigger sitting area, actually for about 8 people, you have to be 25 peeps to get it!!!!!!! You have quite a minimum charge to get a table at all. The place it self is not very nicely done and with a little effort it could be amazing. Anyhow, we had a great evening at the end. It is a very special view and a great feeling to have drinks in the warm air on the highest roof top bar in the world
1
I have been to 1- Altitude three times, the view from the top is incredible. It is a shame the service is terrible. The worst service I have experience at a bar. The waiters including the managers are very agrresive and act like they want to start a fight. They are very irrespectful and have a huge attitude problem.If you like going to a bar and getting good service this is not the place for you. I reall hope any of the owners is able to read this, the place could be one of the best in Singapore but the service makes it the worst. I have been tempted to file a complain against this establishment because of the way we have been treated. This is the only bar I have been to where the waiters and managers are the ones trying to start a fight. Probably you are reading this and might not believe me. In case you still decide to go, my best advise is be very carefull of the waiters and if any mis understanding takes place dont bother calling a manager, they only make things worse

A great complement to the Marina Bay Sands bar for visitors. See the view from one then grab a taxi and head here. But know what you're getting. Once youre up there the view is great & there's no denying it's a cool space. I spotted a lot of roped off sponsored events which raised the tack factor (kids in promotional t shirts for drinks companies) . They're pretty snooty about letting you in (&they charge) Personally I preferred the bar at Ku De T

I visit 1 Altitude bar on the Friday night as I heard a lot of good things about the restaurant from my friend but to my experience I don't find the place that much present to visit. Starting from the group floor entrance until to entrance on the 62 floor yu will find around 15 to 20 staff standing and giving you the direction which makes me feel uncomfortable. Everything there seem to be very systematic services. One time visit for this place would be enough. I would recommend other roof toprestaurant rather than this one as they at least have a lively and friendly atmosphere there
4
A popular roof-top bar with 360 degree views of the city. If you want a "cool crowd" but with a little less hassle (an pretention) than Ku De Ta, this is a great choice. I recommend having dinner at Stellar (the restaurant a floor below) - as it gives you free access to this outdoor bar
3
Very expensive to go up, though you do get 1 free drink. The view is ultimately amazing as you get a 360 degree view of Singapore. Drinks and food are good but also expensive. Great to do once.

$25 cover. Door staff snobby. No one was there. Went to KU DE TA at Marina Bay Sands, no cover, great view and good crowd.

Dear Guests, I just visited OneAltitude at UOB Plaza last night, and I decided to share my experience because the Restaurant Manager, who addressed himself as Gabriel in the most horrific and threatening manner, actually used the most horrible attitude towards me when I plainly told him about the inconsistency in the message deliveries by personnel on the 1st floor and 62nd floor. I was intending to attend a birthday gathering, so my friends told me to go up and did not mention any cover charge. Thus, when I reached, the personnel told me to make the payment for the cover charge, so I called my friends to clarify, because my previous visit did not incur any cover charge as well. My friends told me that they did not pay any charge so I clarified once again with the entrance personnel and they said, "it's ok ma'am, your friend had a reservation, so you may go up." After hearing this, I went up, and the personnel pressed 62Nd Floor. When I reached 62nd floor, the restaurant female employee told me to go down to 61st floor to make payment for the cover charge. I told her the inconsistent messages just confused me. Then this was the time, the horrible Manager Gabriel appeared. He used a very stern voice to tell me that I had to make payment downstairs. After having so much hassle and when I was in heel, the upset feeling already filled me, so I told them to take my card and made the payment using MasterCard for me, i did not wish to go down again. So Gabriel said "ma'am, I only asked you to go down one level and not all the way down." So I tried explain to him the inconsistency between different employees and I think it would be better to justify the problem before confusing guests in future, especially when I myself actually work in the service industry. To my surprise, Gabriel replied in a very threatening and horrific manner "Ma'am, you just don't want to pay for the cover charge right? Fine, you can go up now." If anyone was in my shoes and just go up like that, I salute you for your high tolerance level, but sorry I could not conform, because paying cover charge was not my main concern! Seriously i can afford only $25, will I get my pride and ego being stepped like this just over $25?? In fact,what I wanted to tell him was the bad service standard! So when I tried to defend myself over his untrue statement, Gabriel, the horrific manager, walked off himself! Seriously I was totally disgusted by such service standard when especially Altitude was such a well-known place. His attitude towards me was more like a gangster than a service personnel. So I decided to write in and address this horrific incident to the management, hence I asked for the management email, then he was reluctant to give me and was in fact starring at me. So I insisted to get the email because I think OneAltitude is a good place and should keep up to good service and not allowing someone like Gabriel to tarnish the reputation. To my surprise again, he asked a female attendant to pass me a name card and so I asked for his name, and the most scary part happened, he stared down at me sternly, bent down a little and moved closer towards my face with that horrific stare, and said in very harsh and curt manner "Gabriel!" Honestly speaking, I felt threatened with that stare and harsh tone. So I asked the female attendant beside if she felt the same, of course she chose to keep quiet. And when I asked her if there was any management name whom I can write to, she said Gabriel was the restaurant manager. Does that mean that even I write in will be useless ultimately? I asked myself, but that should not be the case! Anyway, Gabriel gave me that snobbish look when the attendant mentioned his position. To be honest, the whole incident just upset me to the max and I share this incident is to share a horrible experience in a well-known place, OneAltitude. I guess being a manager, you should lead by example to uplift the service standard, if you show that it is alright to be rude to guests, I sincerely suspect if the company could sustain in the long run because Singapore is a very service oriented country. And my recommendations to Gabriel are, register him for better service management or anger management or take leave if something bad or unhappy happened to him at home so that he will not show his attitude towards guests who are already dissatisfied over the lousy service. Anyway in the end, I asked all my friends to leave because I believe with the money spent, we deserve much much better service. Ironically, my friend told me this restaurant manager, Gabrriel James, was a finalist for the service award 2013 organised by Citibank. This irony really sets me to think if the award system really nominate the right candidates. Sadly to say, his service standard and the award criteria are not aligned. And in fact, I think he was not worried about me writing in because such high profile would surely benefit him, but is his service genuine? I let you decide. Hopefully this review will catch someone's attention and tell him not to behave like a "bouncer" than a restaurant manager, and no guest should be treated like a "drunkard" than a real guest

A breathtaking place, the bar of the Marina Bay, I must admit, however, that is so very expensive, in fact for only two cocktails I spent something like S $ 50, but one sip of these cocktails to more than 200 meters high is priceless, the view you have from up here is incredible.This bar is really great and I am not surprised if most of the reviews speak well about it, is a smart, frequented by beautiful people and above all accessible to everyone.There are 3 ways to access it, to have a room booked at Hotel Marina Bay, or charge admission for a visit to the sky deck as a tourist, or finally appear before the elevators and go through the obligatory drink at the bar, in each case .... you pay for it!But I think there a cocktail during sunset is a must and I believe they're all money well spent
3
Nothing worth mentioning about the food except the fact that they were very well presented and exquisite. Go somewhere else if you're looking for really good food. If you dine in the restaurant, you get to go to the rooftop bar for free, skipping the $25 cover charge(that includes a drink).The view is awesome with very good singers and music. Good for couples and friends
5
A friend took us up here while we were visiting. Stunning! Get up there.Cover charge was 25 sgd each (30 with tax added) including a drink. We had 3 sing slings. The view at night was awesome, so good we stayed for more drinks despite it being way over our budget. Very memorable
4
This has to be one of the most impressive Sky Bar's on the planet. The view is breathtaking, really enjoyed it here. Pretty average priced drinks for a trendy bar in Singapore. The bar stays open quite late until 4:00am Friday / Sat I think. Perfect place to take a date, friends or colleagues for the best view in Singapore and a few drinks. Great atmosphere
4
To begin with, it takes 30SGD to go up there and one drink is included. The view is absolutely stunning and I don't think anyone would disagree with me. And seriously, if you want to have a great panoramic view of the city, just go up there instead of the Flyer! It's a lot more awesome than the Singapore Flyer.The music is alright. You would want to dance but no one dances up there because apparently everyone is so overwhelmed by the great view up there. So it's probably the best that you go up there, grab a drink, enjoy the view then go to some other clubs instead of spending the entire night there
4
We love to take visitors to Singapore here around 18:30 to see the city at dusk then watch the sunset and then the city lights up. It is decent value as your admission fee is the cost of the first drink and is less than other rooftop bars around Marina Bay. It allows children prior to 22:00 and is within walking distance of Boat Quay restaurants or CBD locations
4
Great views from this bar. We went on a Monday night so it was pretty quiet. $25SGD entry free included a cocktail. Staff were average. I've been to rooftop bars in Bangkok which leave this place for dead, but it's still a good experience in Singapore. Once is probably enough. I would still recommend
5
A very nice place to hangout at night with amazing view from level 63 ,feel so close to the skys,loveee it! Dont forget to dress up ladiesss ^^
5
If you are looking for the place to have a drink outdoors enjoying the skyline close to the skys this is the place.
4
Located opposite to the old city center and the Marina Bay Sands hotel, this is the perfect place to have 360° view over the city. The entrance fee includes a drink, which makes it reasonable again.
5
One of the best views in Singapore overlooking the harbor, China Town, Marina Bay Sands, Cricket Club, and much more.
1
Staff are very indifferent to you and very unhelpful to the point of being arrogant and rude. Wouldn't waste my time or money on this second rate bar.
5
This is my first time visit and it really impress me a lot! After you pay about SGD 30 then you'll be escort to the rooftop bar, and the view is really amazing, you could see that marina bay sands is not that high from here :))I think it's a must visit when you travel to S
1
We paid 70 Singapore dollars to get in on NYE which included 2 drinks. There was a menu with choices so we ordered what we wanted from this very list but were told we had to go to another bar for the beer- we walked over to the other bar and the bar tender spat in the drink even though we were not rude at all. We asked for a new beer without the added extra which eventually we got with some hassle. There was no apology. The staff here were incredibly rude and it was ridiculously expensive. Go to Marina Sands instead, much better in every way
5
If you are looking for a place with a spectacular view on hotels and skyline then that’s the place to go. Going up costs 25 Singapore dollars, including one drink. There are also nice snacks available we had a yummy pizza and truffle fries – more than we could eat! The view is just amazing; the music was a bit loud for chatting. There are lounge seats to sit on and enjoy the view
5
Go go go The view of the surrounding area is breath takingGo for a drink per dining elsewhereSet price for spend per headMore staff than guests think they are concerned about people leaning over the edge!The highest bar in the world apparentl
4
I'm not one for paying exorbitant fees to get into a bar, but when in Singapore...I can understand why they charge, to avoid sightseers who want the view but don't want to buy drink, so fair enough.The view is spectacular and the atmosphere was pretty chilled. Definitely worth it if passing through Singapore
5
A chill-out lifestyle venue on the top floors of One Raffles Place, 1-Altitude rooftop bar offers breathtaking view of S'pore.
The place to be !!!!
5
Apparently the highest alfresco bar in the world at 282metres - great atmosphere, music, drinks - this is a great place to enjoy sounds, drinks & fun.
4
amazing view, friendly staff, conveniently located in the heart of CBD. One of the best roof top bars in Singapore.
4
This is a spectacular disco bar with scenic views on Singapore. You pay your entrance ticket (including 1 drink) at the basement of an anonymous skyscraper and you’re thrown into a party. You need to get your drink as soon as you go out of the lift, as you won’t be able to take your eyes off the skyline when you arrive on the upper “platform”. The music is ok, the bar is crowded with local people and just a few tourists, and in my opinion this is good, as when I travel abroad for a few days I don’t want to meet countrymen.I can’t recommend you a drink, as I only took a Coke (I suffer from vertigo and my legs were already quite weak) but I think it doesn’t really matter what you drink in a similar place: the highness and the landscape are enough to get you drunk
1
I didn't go to the restaurant here but my friends and I booked a table at the club which required a preauthorisation of my friends credit card. Normally not a problem, but when I arrived at the club with my girlfriend I was told that our table was full- which was not correct, and I would have to pay an entrance fee which after a long discussion I agreed to just so we could enjoy one of our 3 nights in the city together. However, as I walked into the lift area- one of the staff members verbally insulted me using a 4 letter explitive- which obviously annoyed me further and I left immediately- I didn't even make it to the club. AND YET , the club turned around at the end of the night and said they had made a mistake and that the table we had booked was not actually full like they said it was- by this point I was in club st having a few drinks- and that even though i was refused entry, had to pay again to get in, they would be charging my friends credit card anyway (£180!!! More) as if I was present on the table. It was their error yet we still had to pay! It is literally disgusting- I wanted to contact the police but we had little time to do so as we left soon after and now I would rather just forget the whole thing rather than try and claim it back while in England.
5
Visited the bar on the 63rd floor, the highest open top bar in the world...... There is a 25 sing dollar cover charge pp but that includes your first drink. There is a lovely band playing and the views over the marina bay area and Singapore are amazing. Well worth it for a romantic sun downer or two
1
Went to 1 Altitude on Saturday night. The bar didn't open at 18.00 as advertised and a very, very rude security guy told us that it would open later. No explanation, no attempt at finding out when it would open. He had a very rude attitude and should have been sacked on the spot. The bar staff in the other bar downstairs (the "sports bar") are equally rude. Did not greet us at all and simply threw menus on the table. We left without spending any money. Will never return. There are far better, friendlier and affordable bars in Singapore. Don't waste your time or money
4
The bar is located on the rooftop of the building with glass railings which allows you to have a complete view over Singapore.Yes it is expensive but yes the view is worth it. The quality of the beverages was good but not memorable for a 20$ cocktail. The view however is amazing and this alone for me was well worth the trip
5
It costs £12.50 per person to go up but that includes a drink, compared to the shard in London which is £25 per person and no drink. Also at 282 metered it's only a little shorter. 360 Degree view over towards Marina Bay and the city. Music playing in the lower deck area, great view all around
5
One of my favourite parts of Singapore! The view from the top was breathtaking – especially at night time as you could see the city lit up and all the ships out at sea. I have visited the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, and was far more impressed with 1 Altitude. It cost $25 to get to the top which also comes with a free drink – after that you must pay for drinks which, like the rest of Singapore, are quite expensive. The only thing I didn’t like was that there was nowhere to sit as all of the seating was reserved – but we got a better view from standing anyway!It should be made more known that it is the tallest building in Singapore and the tallest Al Fresco bar in the world!!! Something they should be very proud of. The bar is also easily accessible from the MRT and at the end of the night there are cheap (and licensed) taxis waiting outside
3
Great view but now you can't go directly to the edge any more. Entrance fee (including one drink) is now overpriced.
5
Great drinks and food (try the truffle oil french fries) at this place. The view is spectacular, great service and atmosphere. Although is an expensive place (you pay about 20 dollars or more for a cocktail), it's kind of "smart casual" place.
Very nice.

My husband and I went their for dinner then to the rooftop bar afterwards, we booked the Resto through the hotel. Firstly, the reservation was missed at the door on the ground floor entrance but it was there on the door at the resto on top... I don't think the receptionist at the door and Resto are well coordinated. We managed to get a table by the window which had a nice view of the bay, the staff was nice , friendly and attentive. Coming from Dubai, food was average if not Below... The ingredients/menu looked decadent however, was not cooked to perfection. I had the cheese souffle and lobster risotto while my husband had the foi gras and steak. The souffle was too big a portion for such rich food, could've served it with more side salad and the risotto was bland and rice was not perfectly cooked. The foi gras was good and light which I liked. My husband's steak was mediocre.After dinner, we went to the rooftop bar that had spectacular view of the city it's breath taking! Music was good but drinks are not cheap (almost standard in Singapore). Overall, it's nice to tell our friends that we've been to the tallest building in Singapore and enjoyed the amazing view with good music and friendly staff... We'd recommend to give the food a miss and opt for Sky on 57 instead
2
There are high glass fences all around the bar so you can't see the city directly, only through the glass walls. The bar was very busy, loud and a bit dirty. We only stayed for 30 minutes and left. We had been to KU DÃ‰ TA earlier in the evening and even though it's not as high it was a much nicer & more sophisticated experience
5
We visited 1-altitude on our honeymoon on a stopover back from the Maldvives, and it was absolutely the best bit of our brilliant trip.We left it late to try and get a reservation so just turned up, were shown straight into a lift and went up to the floor where you order your drinks. We went for a bottle of VC champagne and paid about 100SD so as ridiculously overpriced as you might have expected. We then went up to the bar and collected our drinks.There were lots of reserved tables but we asked when people were due to arrive to them and it turned out it wasn't for an hour or so, so the staff let us use them until then.The views are incredible, we were there in time for sunset but the night views are awesome. Its not too overcrowded but we were there relatively early
5
This is my first visit to Singapore and I was told this is a must do, but I'm petrified of heights, so what to do ? Well I bit the bullet and I'm here now, using their free wifi to write this review. The views are amazing and the great thing is lots of space between you and the edge so it's not terrifying ! A Gin n Tonic (Bombay) is 18 GSD which is great value given the location, service is good, and there is just a really relaxed buzz about the place ! I'm coming back tomorrow 
4
Great views of Singapore. There is a cover charge which includes one drink. Wednesday night is ladies night so ladies are free and receive a voucher for a free drink. It is difficult to get a seat as most are reserved and it is fairly busy. Drinks are expensive
4
Have been here 3 times now. It is 'the highest al-fresco bar in the world' apparently. It is an amazing view in all directions. Truly helps to understand size and density of Singapore. Wonderful to be there as the sun goes down around 7:30pm or later to watch the light show on Marina Bay. Wednesday night is 'Ladies Night' and ladies enter free; drinks are quite expensive as you expect in Singapore, but it is worth it here for the view and ambience. Over 21s only after 6pm. Also, it closes if there is lightning, or a private party, with no notice. A Must Do when you are in Singapore
4
The view is breathtaking. The music was okay too. Drinks were priced on the more pricey side but hey, it's Singapore, alcohol is meant to be expensive. I just don't think I can afford getting wasted with the price of their drinks. Not a lot of people were dancing, either. I don't think it's meant to be a place where guests get wasted and people have a crazy time anyways. Feels more like a place where people hang out after work. I don't know how this place feels like on other days, but we went there on a wednesday which might've been the reason it felt that way
5
Brilliant concept of having the bar on the roof top. Luckily, it did not rain that evening! One gets a fabulous view of the city from up on the 64th floor. I managed to shoot some unbelievable photos from up there! I enjoyed every moment spent up there
4
Nice roof terrace with a 360 degree view over Singapore. Good for a beer after a long business day.
4
Love the view at the top - must say it's nicer that Ku De Ta.
The wine list is snug but great value!
Best to get up to the bar at 61st floor to race up to 63rd floor at 6pm. Worth a visit!!!
3
One Altitude is a place where i will recommend for you to bring your tourist friends once- as a sightseeing segment of their itinerary. Great bird's eye view of Singapore especially during the F1 season- you can see the entire track lit up at night. Beware of rain and long queues... it can be a real dampener if one had queued for close to half an hour before reaching the end of the line only to be rejected because it started raining
2
There is a cover charge, which is ok. But they take your money before you know about the 15 min waiting in line for the elevator... The bar is ok, but they serve warm wine (been standing on the bench). View is nice. Otherwise, dirty. Uncomfortable chairs
5
I recently visited the 1 Altitude bar on a Friday evening and I have to say that finally we have a great roof top bar and restaurant which comes close to Sirocco in Bangkok. Yes of course Sirocco is a complete different world with the grand entrance walking down the stairs and the glowing bar and the ‘live’ jazz performance but 1 Altitude offers the same breathtaking view of a city and it’s skyline.You have to pay a cover charge downstairs before you go up which includes one standard drink. You walk into a little courtyard walking out of the lift and you can have dinner here and the whole place is nicely landscaped in a tropical setting. We walked up some stairs and you can actually walk around the whole roof top along the terrace. Most of the tables were full with the after work crowd and we managed to get one near the bar. We did not eat there so not sure about food quality.Basically nothing beats the view here! You can walk around and try to spot all the sights with just the wind in your face and the star filled sky above you. The main advantage here is the open-air feeling which is completely different from the enclosed and air-conditioned effect of New Asia Bar. The service staff were friendly and drinks were not cheap but hey, for this view and to be all the way up there it’s worth it! The only other place I guess that can compete with this establishment in Singapore is the Kudeta on top of the Marina Bay Sands
5
I have to admit I have a weakness for “al fresco” rooftop bars, this one has great views of Singapore and a chic yet relaxed atmosphere. They charge you at the entrance(ground floor) 25S$ but this fee includes one drink, when we went (wednesday) it was ladies night and I got in for free plus the drinks for the ladies were discounted. They could invest a little bit more on the drinks though, as they are nothing special, they don’t take enough time to make them
5
The 1- Altitude bar is simply breathtaking and is amongst one of the highest al- fresco rooftop bars in the world. We had an amazing night at 1-Altitude having pre dinner drinks, this rooftop bar offers brathtaking views of downtown Singapore. The evening was followed by an evening of fun and games with dinner and games night with a golf and racing car simulators.....
5
The view is worth every penny - you have to have seen this place at least once. We really enjoyed our evening - only went there for a quick after-dinner drink. Very "trendy". I did find the "reserved" signs on most tables quite annoying as no-one ever showed up..
3
It's the highest view of Singapore so you can see it all !!I thought staff was very friendly and helpfull. Drinks are fine. Diner was average. We had the second seatting and restaurant was not full. My friend and I got this "strange" plate. It had a small deep innercircle with a big rim. In the middle was the veal soaked in jus/saus. On the big rim they had put all the veggies and other things that came with the dish. But if you wanted to take it, the plate collapsed on that side. So the saus went over, table got dirty, thank goodness nobody got it on their clothing. Finally I asked for an extra normal plate, so did my friend :-)The overall feeling we all had, was that you have this amazing place in Singapore but the management is not making the best of it. If you change the skybar interior and boost up the food, it could easily become one of the top ends of Singapore. We had the feeling that because off this top end view, they must think that they do not need to be very special about the rest because people will come anyway. I think that if they would be special, people actually would come back. We have seen it ones, we will not come back
4
Yes, it is expensive but the view is worth it. The service is acceptable but not great. The live band was good but not exceptional. The quality of the beverages was OK but not memorable. The view however is amazing and this alone for me was well worth the trip.
5
For a special dinner out, book a table outside to truly enjoy the experience, not cheap....but what is in Singapore!
5
excellent view of marina bay area city hall, tanjong pagar
5
A spectacular venue with views of all of Singapore and as far as Malaysia. Not recommended for anyone suffering from vertigo ! Elegant open-air venue, quite expensive but understandably trying to remain exclusive - book a table in advance as most are reserved.
4
I wrote a damn good review of this place a couple months back. Went back last week to find out that the cover charge has been raised from an acceptable and reasonable SGD18 to an overpriced and shocking SGD30. Ok 30 bucks for a good pub/club isn't rare. But isn't this too huge a leap?Makes me wonder whether i should have given them that confidence boost then (not that my one review was that important a catalyst.. But u know what I mean).
3
After all of the hype we arrived. from this point on i regretted visiting. Why do people have to talk so loud about how great they are? Perhaps some of the clients would benefit from a visit to the lion enclosure at the Singapore Zoo - at feeding time

1-Altitude Gallery & Bar has easily the best view of downtown Singapore. Situated on the 63rd floor of the OUB Centre, 1-Altitude Gallery & Bar is among the highest al-fresco rooftop bars in the world, and the highest one in Singapore. At 282 meters, and with a unique triangular design, 1-Altitude Gallery & Bar offers a spectacular 360 degree view of Singapore at night, especially the downtown area and its landmarks. As an open concept rooftop bar, there is absoutely no shelter, and at the slightest chance of rain, an alarm will sound, and guests will be requested to move indoors to the bar on level 61.  This actually happened just 5 minutes into my visit, where we planned to celebrate a friend's birthday, so we felt quite upset. Fortunately, staff will inform you once the skies clear up, and you can return to the roof, as it happened for us. As a bar, there is a good range of drinks, at slightly higher than normal prices, and a DJ spinning club / dance music for atmosphere. The food offered consists only of finger food, and is quite expensive. Recommended to dine elsewhere instead. I actually found the service to be excellent. Our group had a personal server, Jane, who assisted us in moving our drinks down to level 61 when it was about to rain, and helped us book a space at the bar. She helped us prepare the birthday cake, and even cleared up the mess after we were done. I felt quite bad however, as she actually passed me her personal pen to fill out a contest entry, and I left it at the bar in level 61, when she helped us moved back up to the roof after the skies cleared up... Her pen went missing after that. Sorry, Jane! The crowds start to gather around 10pm, so if you want to avoid a packed environment, it's best to visit before 9.30pm. Seats available are usually reserved, so unless you make a reservation at least 3 days in advance, you might have to sit at the bar counter, or stand at the standing areas. However, staff will allow you to sit at reserved seats, until the guest who reserved them turns up.  If you're planning a visit to 1-Altitude Gallery & Bar, do note that the required attire is smart casual, and the cover charge is $25 or $30, depending on the day of your visit. Do allocate about 1 hour to soak in the view, chill out with drinks, or just enjoy the music

This bar has a fantastic view,so if you want to pay 25 sgd for the privilage of going up in the lift and having your first drink included in the cost,then it would be worth a look.At the entrance to the lift there would be about 6 staff who seem to be there just to let you know how privilaged you are for them to let you in.They open up one of several red ropes suspended from gold coloured poles and allow you into one of the lifts. On arrival to the rooftop I approached the bar and waited to order my first drink(and waited,and waited,and waited) AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE OTHER CUSTMER AT THE BAR!One of the girls(on the cash register ) behind the bar ignored us as she happily twiddled with her I Phone for 10 minutes.Perhaps I should have felt privilaged to receive mine and my wife's drink after 15 minutes.We walked up the stairs to the viewing deck and took in the breathtaking view.The amount of space was very limited as people jostled to take photographs .I drank my Corona and sat for 20 minutes at a very small table and marvelled at the view.There was no atmosphere in this bar and it not relaxing or enjoyable and I left after just 35 minutes of arriving in the lift.Was it worth it.?...YesWould I go again.....Never ! ...This one has already been ticked of my bucket lis

After having a few people tell us that one altitude roof top bar was the best view in Singapore we decided to take their advise and have a look. Very very true the view from the top 62 nd floor bar was absolutely fantastic. But the service not so great. We arrived there on a Wednesday night it was ladies night so ladies did not have to pay the cover charge but my husband paid $25 SGD which included the first drink. After taking the lift to the 61st floor then transferring to another lift to the 62nd rooftop bar we immediately noticed the confined area of the bar. I order my drink a bloody Mary $22 SGD so we really only saved $3 SGD on the ladies night offer. We waited 15 miniutes for them to serve the two drinks. We then proceeded up the stairs to the rooftop sitting area which was very narrow and not many seats. If you go book a table in advance especially if it's a friday or saturday night. The view was amazing and well worth the trip. 360 degree views of the whole of Singapore and on a clear night you can see almost to Indonesia. It's at number 1 raffles place if interested. The food menu and drinks are quite expensive but Singapore is Gretting a bit like that now
5
the spectacular view from the top highest bar venue in town. a chill adrenalin goes on ur vein once u arrived on top, overlooking the colorful city lights of spore. totally excellent cocktails. friendly staff. but dont forget for making reservation for the restaurant, for the outdoor bar - its not a problem without
5
Breath-taking view at night looking over the city, Marina Bay and across MBS. A great perspective to watch the MBS light slow at night, or to see the sunset.Good cocktails, somewhat mixed in terms of how many people are here. Lots of staff around, so it's easy to get drinks. Maybe too many staff in fact, but I guess they are worried about people hurling things (or themselves) off the edge of this amazingly high open rooftop
5
Avoid the WE (too crowded) and don't forget, no slippers and shorts. Minimum age is requested. The view and feeling are overwhelming.

Fantastic views, great place to chill.. Windy.. (Be careful of Mobile networks as it might catch Indonesian networks sometimes when windy if on Auto mode)

Undecided about whether to come up here or go to the MBS skypark? GO HERE! This is the Rockafeller Center of Singapore (the Empire State is acually in your view, or in this case, the brilliant MBS Skypark). Entrance includes a drink and this view is best at night. It's better if you've already spent some time in Singapore as you can get your bearings pointing out all the landmarks you've already visited. I live in Singapore and this view cheers me up, it's breathtaking. As it's alfresco and has 360 degree views only hindered by perspex walls, it's a view that really just hits you. Also it's the tallest building in Singapore... (one of three anyway) So got vertigo? Probably best stay on the ground..

Most amazing rooftop view I have ever seen. Great music and bad...good vibe.$25 each to get in, which includes a drink. Tip- order a beer or wine. My mixed drink tasted like watered down pineapple juice. Sort of a rip off, yes but worth it for the view/experience.(highest al fresco rooftop in the world)

The view from 1-Altitude is tops. You get a full 360 view of Singapore and you look down on the Sands. The Sands light shows at 9:30 is a must to see from here. The key is to relax and try and get there just prior to the sun set at 7:30 and stay a while. Magica

It's considered the tallest open air bar in the world. And the view (especially at sunset) is breath taking and worth the trip. The system itself is a bit strange. You need to make your choice of drink before you're even allowed into the elevator. The choice, however, is very limited. Once up there, you don't feel too comfortable as an unbelievable number of waiters and security staff observes each of your steps. All tables carry a 'reserved' sign. You hardly know where to put sown your glass in order to take a picture. I enjoyed the view, took a few pictures, but didn't feel like staying longer than needed

+ve-What a view?????????????? Never seen Singapore like that before from 62nd floor-Very cosy & decent & classy... all at the same time-Nice seating arrangement-Lively band -If you want to see whole of Singapore at once, forget the Flyer or even Marian Bay Sands Sky Park , this is the place to go and that too at night.-ve-Staff is little sarcastic specially those serving in the Gallery for clicking pictures or taking the orders, especially when you are not ordering too many drinks-food is nice but less variety in chicken & fis

The view is rather breath taking...... good place to hang out with friends. If you have any phobia with height, it will not be wise to go there, the side walls are all glass panel. The drinks are ok... the service is terrible, here no seat there no seat, reservations here and there, when called to reserve, the staff said need not do so. The staff do not care, ask you to move here and there, till the people who reserve the seats come. The system is terrible. Buy ticket at the ground floor, after that you take lift to the roof top then have to queue at one of the corner to get your drink. The price is average

See Singapore like I have never seen it before! Simply awesome.You get a 360 degree view of the entire place. You don't realize that Singapore has so many tall buildings built so densely until you see it from the bird's eye view.I had drinks at Sky Garden just last night and thought that was great. Now I think Sky Garden pales in comparison

great view, plenty of space to stand around even if u dun get a table, friendly and helpful staff, great ambience, good crowd, good music, reasonable cover charge which includes a drink so technically u are not paying any cover charge. sucks only when it starts to rain

We loved the view from the top... its simply magnificant... the drinks are priced little on the higher side but worth it for such an ambience. Its very difficultt to get a reservation there on a weekend... we enjoyed and had good fun.

From the 67th floor with only a bit of plexiglass separating you from the edge of the building, the views out over Singapore are simply amazing. You are so high your mobile will keep switching service from Singapore to Indonesia and back again!There is a S$18-20 cover for the first drink. Subsequent drinks are just as expensive.We had pizza and a cheese platter and they were surprisingly good for a place that is basically selling itself on location.The service was fairly abysmal. We had to ask the MANY security guys to find servers for us constantly. I guess all the security is to prevent any "accidents"?The dress code is enforced but rather lame... no sandals, no shorts. Fine and good... but it doesn't stop people from showing up in jeans and Tshirts. I mean, you could have on short pants and very nice sandals and look far better than some of the people I saw who passed the dress code muster.Most of the tables are "reserved" which means standing up for a drink. We protested and did get a table though.All negatives aside... if you want a bit of a splurge and an unforgettable view out over Singapore, this is the place to be!!! I think it's worth it ONCE --Take note...there is no place to get out of the rain. So if it seems like it might shower, I'd give it a miss

I went there on a Friday night around 9PM, so not too busy and fairly easy to get in despite a small queue outside. Went to the rooftop bar with some friends for drinks and to enjoy the amazing view, which was truly breath taking. I can definitely recommend to head there, enjoy the view, have a few cocktails and listen to some good DJ music - and if you get there before 9.30PM you can also see the Marina Bay sands light show from the rooftop, and probably get a better view from here than anywhere else

Had lunch here today with one colleague and a client. We arrived at 1pm having ridden the awesome elevator all the way to 62nd floor. Feels like you are taking off as you leave Raffles Place and all yes all the other buildings behind. Restaurant was very quiet, but bizarrely the multiple waiters seemed to busy to pay much attention. We all opted for the set menu ordering sushi & sashimi, pumpkin soup and portobello mushroom. Started were good, but the mushroom would have been much better served hot. Mains were very tired, overcooked and dry fish for two, and beef pie for one. Everything came with a helping of salad which was healthy - but uninspired. We would have had dessert but we were ignored by the waiters who were more interested in moving and clearing tables, so finally had time for coffee only. That was annoying since the set lunch included three courses and had no option for only two. Overall think this is one of the coolest places n Singapore to be seen, but recommend that you skip the restaurant and head straight to the bar

Gallery & Bar at Altitude is one of the experiences that must not be missed when you are visiting Singapore, especially if you are the party animal types. The place is right on the terrace of the tallest building in Singapore at level 63.There is a restaurant also at level 61 which offers you breathtaking view of the city with closed environs. But the roof top experience wins all the accolades hands down.When you reach the terrace you are taken aback by the sheer sight of the city at night as the view is something that I can't put in words. The excitement keeps building up as the in house DJ throws some sensational tracks which give you an even more high.The food is absolutely awesome & you can try your hand at an array of delicacies along with some exquisite wines & beer! The only dampener can be the weather as they close the roof top if there are clouds & rain for obvious reasons (they don't want their guests to get electrocuted by the lightening!).To cut it short I would only say that if you really don't mind spending extra dollars for a life time experience, just hit it when you are in Singapore

I made a reservation at Altitude using the online reservation system many weeks ahead of our planned trip to Singapore . When my wife and I showed up, we found a long line of people hoping to get in without a reservation. I confidently gave my name to the staff lady who could not find my reservation. Tip: if you reserve using the online system and get no email confirmation, you don't actually have a reservation, try again. As I luckily had a printout on me of my attempt at a reservation, the lady was kind enough to accommodate us. The view from Altitude is breathtaking and the atmosphere is electric. The music was great. Altitude is THE nighttime place to visit in Singapore but make sure you reserve ahead of time. It is all worth it

We had reservations for dinner but arrived early to visit the al fresco bar. This was an amazing experience. First the elevator trip up to the 62nd floor (fast ride and made my ears pop!) and then the stunning views from the rooftop bar. Then back to the restaurant for an amazing meal! The portion sizes were not huge, but suited me to a tee! The food was beautifully presented and tasted delicious. Really glad we went there!

As told in the review before you have to preorder one drink. Afterwards you get a voucher and you can go up with the lift to the 63. floor. The menu is limited but if you know what cocktail you want you can still order it! Drinks on the menu are 18 oder 20S$ but if you order a Singapore Sling (not mentioned on the menu) you pay 22S$ and it's definitely a better deal.Get your drink at the rooftop bar and enjoy the amazing view. The music on friday is quite nice (it's more the day for a party and dancing). Anyway, many people are just going there for one drink, so the dance floor will not be crowded at all.I felt that the staff was kind of rude for a bar that is suposed to offer you a high standard. You will hear thinks like "walk on, go over there, you can't stay here ect." and it would be no problem if they would say it in a polite way. Customers that consume more will be preferred. So you might not get a table or they will ask you to leave certain areas.All in all it's a great experience to go there for a cocktail! (or even 2) ..it's also kind of romantic ;

Entry to the bar reminded me of a cheap 80's nightclub. Forced to queue outside lift and buy a drink from a limited menu on a grubby laminated card surrounded by "security" staff... No objection to a cover charge for a place like this, but why can you not choose from the full menu?? Our plan was to have a pre-dinner cocktail, but that was scuppered.Once in, you present your voucher and get your drink. Amazingly they serve Larios Gin - anyone that drank Gin from a Spanish supermarket in the 80's would be familiar with the brand. Perhaps it was part of a theme to match the entrance charade.The view is stunning, but I suspect most people only stay for one drink ,as it didn't feel like a relaxing bar. In standard Singaporean fashion, all the tables were reserved, but empty. With a quick visit for the view, but not a place you would feel inclined to return to

What fantastic view.. it is breathtaking. Although the price per head was a minimum charge of S$48 and you had to give your order in before you even got to the bar (a bit pathetic if you ask me.. would like to sit down and then decide what I will be drinking!!) but the view is fantastic. The bar staff are actually very helpful and friendly and the DJ was pumping out some great tunes after 11!
