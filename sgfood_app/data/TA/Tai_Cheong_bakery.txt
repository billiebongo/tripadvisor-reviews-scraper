Love the eggtarts from Tai Cheong the best! Egg custard is smooth and firm, pastry is buttery and crumbly. Just the way i like it! Tried their pandan tarts - with very aromatic coconutty pandan flavour infused, but still prefer the original!

I always saw the long queue and decided to just wait for the heat to go off. Tried the egg tart so far the best I had(my personal preference( in Singapore). However, it has to be eaten while hot to have the best flavour.

Bought some egg tarts for sharing. They tasted really nice especially when eaten warm. Very flavourful.

Everyday the queue is always long at the Tai Cheong Egg Tarts. I manage to get some hot piping egg tart at a short time. Worth waiting for these delicious egg tart.

Tai Cheong bakery used to be great and very popular (Long queues with at least an hour wait).Recently, it’s no longer crowded and the egg tarts are not as great as they have changed their way of baking, for convenience. In the past, tai Cheong egg tarts are baked using individual metal egg tarts tin. The staff will have to remove the egg tarts individually before they can pack into box. Recently, they replaced the metal tins with disposable paper (this saves time and effort). However, the egg tarts are no longer as tasty as the crust is not fully baked and instead of usual brown colour, it’s white. It’s disappointing how franchise can degenerate so quickly. Isn’t taste most important for f&b industry? See photos and you will get what I meant.

This is a small bakery located inside takashimaya. They served Hk styled egg tarts which is pretty popular as there is a constant flow of customers queueing to buy them.They make them fresh at the outlet and what can go wrong with freshly over-baked egg tarts?

The Tai Cheong egg tarts and coconut tarts taste awesome. I can't say that they are the best in Singapore, but as a Hong Kong native, I can safely tell you that they are as authentic and as delicious as they get. I have been to both the one in Takashimaya and the one in Holland Village half a dozen times, and they are equally good. Now the bad news - the service is atrocious. It is so bad that it is tragic and comical at the same time. Here are two recent examples:Example (1) - Last Saturday, 10am, Takashimaya basement outletMe: "Good morning."Tai Cheong staff: [Staring at the egg tarts in front of her, not fully awake, didn't realize I was standing right in front of her]Me: "Hi, good morning, can I get some egg tarts please?"Tai Cheong staff: [Woke up from her daze, annoyed, and without looking at me] "How many?"Me: "One egg tart and one coconut tart please."Tai Cheong staff: "Cannot. Have to buy four."Me: [Not quite comprehending] "Sorry, can I buy one each please?"Tai Cheong staff: "Cannot" [Hold up the price list and put it in front of my face]Me: "Ok, it says a box of four costs $7.60, but it doesn't say I can't buy one for $1.90. I'm the only customer at the moment, can you just sell me a couple please?"Tai Cheong staff: [Visibly annoyed. Turned to her colleague, mumbled something in Hokkien, shrugged, thought for another minute, then turned to me] "OK, fine, since you're the only customer."... I can't tell you how grateful and privileged she made me feel as a Tai Cheong customerExample (2) - Couple weeks ago on a Saturday, 1pm, Holland Village branchAfter finishing our lunch at Tai Cheong, we went to the cashier to pay.Me: "Hi, can I get the bill for table 3 please?"Tai Cheong staff: "Sure. That would be $40 please."Me: "Thanks, can I also get a couple egg tarts to go?"Tai Cheong staff: "Sure. You can line up at the takeaway line after this, and come back here and pay."Me: "Err... but the line is quite long and the egg tarts are right in front of you, can you just give me two so I don't have to line up again?"Tai Cheong staff: "No. You already paid for the food you ate inside. You have to line up again."... obviously!!!Bottomline, I love all the baked goods at Tai Cheong. Egg tarts, coconut tarts, polo buns, chicken pies, they are delicious. But the service is atrocious. If Tai Cheong management is reading this, PLEASE replace your staff with a vending machine

Was crowded when we were there so waited for a table. Order the egg tarts and a few other items and found them to be very sweet and normal.Not worth your time if you do not like to queue. Alternatively you can order the take away if you do not want to wait for a table.Probably the last time here.

In the 3 days I passed this place, there was a constant queue. One day I decided it must be good and decided to queue. You are there for the egg custard tart. They cannot make them fast enough. It's a tiny little shop in the basement food court in Takashimaya. There is a minimum purchase of 4 tarts for S$7.60. They are delicious! Give them try
