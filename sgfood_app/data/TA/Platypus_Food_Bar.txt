A really good place to have a meal with a friend and chill or study in school :) There's a good selection of food with the different themed food stalls available, and the drinks at Thirsty Guys are really interesting and worth a try! My favourite is the matcha latte :

Located at NUS Faculty of Science, this eatery is within walking distance from Kent Ridge MRT Station (about 10mins walk).Once you enter this eatery, you will be amazed at the wonderful ambience it provides. The decor is minimalistic, yet elegant. The lighting was great. And there were a variety of healthy and delicious food for one to enjoy.I opted for the salad bowl with 1 meat ($5.90). The staff there were helpful and generous with the toppings. I chose an egg, mushrooms, kidney beans, tomatoes, corn and smoked duck breast. There were also many other varieties of vegetables and meats for you to choose from.Tastewise, it was really delicious, especially the smoked duck breast. The smoked duck breast had a savoury bite to it, and it was juicy and tender. I enjoyed every moment of savouring this delicious duck breast. The vegetables were fresh as well and had a crunchy bite to them. Overall, for the portion of food given, it was well worth the money spent. No wonder this place is a hit among many NUS students and staff members :)

Located in the science faculty in NUS, this place is often seen bustling with students and professors during meal times. Other times you'd walk into a quiet, yet comfortable space with few students taking their late lunch, studying or having discussions. With a variety of food ranging from our local favourite nasi lemak to Japanese curry to quinoa bowls for the health nuts among us, its no wonder why you'll always see a crowd during lunch hours. For the workaholics, fret not if you missed the lunch hour and are left stumped by the lack of food in the science canteen. The food bar serve their hot foods till about 4/5pm with small eats such as brownies, muffins and of course, for our caffeine lovers, COFFEE. Thirsty Guys, "an American-styled bubble tea aka BOBA concept which focuses on quality and fair play", has both straight no-mess coffees and creative and fun boba drinks. Roasting their own beans and using their own CrazyGoodMilk, they have a range of drinks from classic milk coffee to funky flavours like black sesame latte and red velvet latte. Other fun flavours include cookie butter batter and sea salt butterscotch! So if you're looking some place to chill with fussy friends or you're the fussy one, you know where to head to

Amazing portion, superb taste, would eat this for life. The Mac and Cheese is the best, topped with a serving of fragrant beef or smoked duck, best!

Love the drinks from Thirsty Guys and the pasta. Music is not too loud so it's good to not just study, but also to chat with friends.

The ambience at Platypus food bar is calm and soothing. They provide quality food in campus at an affordable price. Platypus is popular amongst students and staff of NUS and I often travel down from FASS just to have a nice wholesome meal of mac and cheese or nasi lemak. Grateful for its presence in NU

As well as the best coffee I've found in Singapore, the Food Bar offers a range of tasty food options. The format is like a salad bar, so you choose which base you want, a curry, pasta or salad and then get to pick topping and sides. The food is a little more expensive than the campus canteens but tastes delicious and is a nice change from noodles and rice. They also have a small range of cakes which accompany my morning coffee perfectly

Ambience was amazing, small and cosy with the perfect lighting. Music was not too loud and food was served in general portions. Pricing was also very reasonable and overall a great experience! Would definitely recommend everyone to patronise for great food and even greater prices! On top of that, the staff were really friendly and made me feel totally welcome there! :
