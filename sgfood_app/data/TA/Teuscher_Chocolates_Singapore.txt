Situated in the same shop as Teuscher, the Once Upon a Milkshake was probably the best milkshake I ever had in my life! Definitely highly recommended.

The Famous Swiss chocolates have arrived in Singapore, and are worth a try. Pricey though, but make nice gifts to friends who have almost everything. The lady behind the counter is patient as I chose the truffles that make up my boxes of treats. She also offered small cards that come in (equally small) envelops that accompany the treats beautifully
