Good bar. Food is ok. Beer is all right. Perfect for a night out drinking with few friends.
A bit pricey, but still fine. ( there is a hawker on the other side of the street if you want a very cheap option.

Good food, friendly staff, service a little slow at times. Always have a good promotion in beer and great atmosphere

Saturday House in Quemoy Building is a nice place to relax. The food is average with average services.

Nice cosy corner pub/restaurant along Upper Paya Lebar. Serves Asahi and German beer on tap. Offers pub food. Had the roast pork and it was decent. It gets pretty busy in the evenings. Overall a great place to chill out.

Went there for lunch and tried the carbonara and fish n chips. They were both freshly made and tasted great. However, the fish n chips were quite salty, so be careful!

Had lunch there with friends as I would have not discovered it myself. Great place for casual weekend breakfast and lunch and even dinner. Really nice place to just chill and enjoy your coffee

Parking is decent, lots of clams in the pasta, but it wasn't tasty. Crispy pork belly was good. Will not return in the future.

Had a good time the staff was accomodating and helpful. Food was quite acceptable. Prices are acceptable but the portions are a bit small

Read about the good reviews and decided to try the roast pork, marmite wings and carbonara spaghetti. The roast pork was a disappointment, the skin is not crispy, it was soggy. Enough said.The marmite wings were ok, but nothing wow.Carbonara was the best among 3 dishes. Not too creamy, tasty and good portion of ham bacon mushroom. I'm not sure if I will go out of my way to this cafe as the food is really quite average, and considered costly (given the quality) if there were no eatigo promotion.

It was a corner unit with a brightly lit Chicago-style signage. We thought it might be a hangout place and decided to check it out one day and we managed to find the chance to one day.Service was very attentive but not overtly eager to impress. The place decor is good enough for one wanting to stay on as long as you step up to it.We were very much impressed with the speed of the response upon each request made to the staff, we basically did not have to look around too long to get someone to help. Considering we were sitting on the outside and at the corner of the premise.However, the food quality was not all so impressive. The dishes were made to order definitely, for we could still feel the heat and the juiciness of the pork collar when they were dished to us after a while from the time of our order. But the general portion of the entire dish (main & sides together) are well too small. Especially on the Mix Grill. They are reasonable portion in fine dines though. So that shall give you a gauge.Prices are at that reasonable range where you would not make any noise.Any noise that may be could be coming from the next table (depending on your luck), that actually was the eventual reason that made us cut our dinner short and sharp. We cannot understand how 1 could chat and laugh at the top of their lungs throughout.With that, proximity between tables on the outside - may be a problem for claustrophobics. Inside would be cosier.Overall, it's a nice place to sit down, have some food and drinks with a few friends, and chat away. Will return some time later when we have chance again...PS. Parking will be a major problem. There is no proper parking lots within vicinity. Drivers would have to risk parking on rocky front porch of shophouses, or kerbsides in the private housing estates
