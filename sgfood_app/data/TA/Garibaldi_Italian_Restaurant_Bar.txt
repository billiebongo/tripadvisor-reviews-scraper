We are visiting Garibaldi now since 2008 and have never been disappointed. Service is always impeccable and food is excellent. Their wind list is outstanding.whoever loves good food, do not miss out to have a meal at Garibaldi.

Excellent Saturday brunch! Beautiful selection of food, lovely prosecco and wine and fantastic service! It was everything we had hoped for! Highly recommended.

Great place to use your ns reward. Everything was excellent from entering the restaurant to service to exiting. If you are coming in expectation to only use ns reward, do note that Still Water is chargeable.

In the past we went for dinner. This time we went for lunch. The restaurant was not full. The bred and olive oil were very nice. The food excellent. The service ok.What totally spoilt my impression is that half way thru our luncheon some other guests departed at which time the waiter removed the table cloth and left the ugly tables exposed without a table cloth. In a restaurant of this reputation one would expect the waiter to have learned how to remove and at the same time pull a new table cloth across the table. Not so here. The ''naked'' table was left for the remainder of our lunch and we had to walk out between all the uncovered tables, like in a cheap canteen. Truly a sad state of affair. There are more stylish places to eat

Whenever you go to a fancy restaurant like this, you have some expectations (you should because you'll be paying more than in other -fancy- places) and there are certain things that have to be correct. In this case, I'll start with the negatives as there were several. First, we come in by by 6:55 (reservation is at 7:00) and were asked if we would like to drink something at the bar first or would like to go straight to the table? We said, we'll have a glass of champagne at our table. That is not possible we were told as we first have to check if the table is ready. Please note that -of course- the table is ready as by this time more than half the restaurant is still empty. So we have to wait anyway in the bar and are served some tapwater I assume. Great, you just sit there like a moron waiting to get to your table while everything is ready anyway. So after about 10mins, we are escorted to our table by a much friendlier person than the one originally welcoming us (this one really needs to have some training). The menu holder on our table for my seat did not contain a menu and nobody noticed until I told them so. Then only after we have ordered everything, we are served some delicious bread and olive oil. By this time, it's around 7:20 or later. Again, you just sit there waiting for the inevitable to happen. There was also too much running around by some waiters and they were also trying to communicate over a distance, not really nice. We also said it was way too cold with the airconditioning blowing at full blast. They changed it, it was much better, but about 5mins later they changed it again to the original setting. Again, why do we have to eat in a freezer? Seriously? Anyway, it didn't start well but as the evening progressed, things got better because the food was very good. The burrata and prosciutto ham very excellent, the duck ragout pasta and seafood pasta also very good, although relatively small portions. All in all, they serve good food, it's definitely overpriced for the ambiance and quantity you're getting so we'll not be going back. There are so many good Italians who do a better job at creating a nice atmosphere and they didn't succeed at that. Of course, you can say that is not why you go eat somewhere, but in these kinds of places, everything matters

Excellent six-course tasting menu and wine pairing. We also had superb service, which is sometimes challenging to find in Singapore.
5
This is an example of fine Italian dining with fresh ingredients and tasty pasta the weather also spoke Italian which was a good sign to begin wit
4
No doubt, the food was good as the brunch menu encompassed a long list of exquisite dishes which were delightful to my palate However, I am slightly disappointed by the atmosphere and service provided. As compared to other restaurants that I have patronised (without a Michelin Star), the experience that I had here paled in comparison. Therefore I would rate the food a 5 but the value a 3-
5
Ordered the Lunch Set Menu for 2 people. Had to make a pre-booking ahead of time because of the popularity of this place.Lunch was 3 courses and a dessert. The quality of the food was very very good. The beef was very tender and it was expertly sliced into the right size. Also, the Aglio Olio is the best one I have ever tasted.The place was pleasantly decorated, and the atmosphere was conducive for conversations. The waiter was very friendly and helpful.Glad the place finally earned its well deserved Michelin Sta
3
Came here many times and realised their food quality has been great. Excellent service with good selection of wines. Nice bar to sit and mingle before dinner. Received 1 star Michelin and price also raised. The menu don't seem to change after so long and the kurobota pork a little too thin and tasted average. The cold pasta with uni was great . The private room sounds insulation can be improved. Came here last night and waiters were too buy to pour my last half bottle of wine. Need to improve this attentiveness to deserve the one star Michelin standard! I won't give 3 stars mainly due to the pork and the service attentiveness in a 1 start Michellin restaurant
5
Excellent service excellent dinner. Highly recommend. Great experience from entrance to desert. The restaurant is very chic and the presentation is well planned
5
This is the best Italian in Singapore! When we complemented the chef for his porcini sauce, he gave us another bowl full!
5
Great food, great service, great time. Loved this place! Extensive veg and meat options. Wine choices were never ending
4
Had celebrated my Bday here.. apparently their good reputation comes for a very good reason.. wine menu is good, not only focus on Italian but also covers other countries evenly as an Italian restaurant. Had my lobster bisque but tomatoes is a bit too strong. My Hubby’s pasta is so pretty as it’s fully covered with truffles.. thick!Service is also very good.
5
My wife & I felt very much like an Italian meal for dinner. Being a bit late (9pm) and a Sunday, most restaurants including our favourite were closed. Luckily, Garibaldi was open and we decided to try it out. What good luck! The place is fantastic! From the moment I called to book a table, to the attentive, knowledgeable server (his name was Lenz, I think?), the fine wine and the food cooked to perfection everything was simply excellent. The chef is amazing!The tasting sampler of 6 starters, Zucchini fritters, the main courses all faultless! Perfect. Definitely going back again and again

We had dinner at Garibaldi restaurant (Singapour) tonight, a restaurant which was awarded one macaron in 2017. We really wonder why. First, we had a reservation at 9pm. We were seated at 9.25. We were asked to wait at the bar with awful and loud music. They did not offer any drink, but handed over the drink list. We did not want any. When we were finally seated, we discovered several free tables. The only explanation for making us wait is too force us to take a first drink.. Second, we were first offered a reduced menu (with 4 or 6 courses menus). When the waiter saw our surprise (we had seen a different menu outside), he handed us the usual menu, à la carte. Again, we had the feeling that they wanted us to order these menus (168 S$4 courses menu). The food was good (tomato mozzarella, fettucine al pomodoro and risotto al fruto di mare) but nothing special. Third, the wine by the glass is extremely expensive (24 S$ a pinio griglio de Sicilia and S$34 a Valpolicella classico (+VIT and services). They are not exceptional wines and the list of wines by the glass very limited (3 choices for white wine, 3 choices for red wine). The music is not adequate (in the bar or the restaurant) and the decoration very basic. To put orchidea flower in "San Pellegrino" glasses is not of the best taste for a restaurant awarded one macaron. A very deceptive experience..
5
They made us deel at ease when we arrived. We could have a drink ar the bar first before being seated ar the table. Peaceful setting. Food was excellent.
3
Returned to Garibaldi for the set lunch at $39++ per person today for 3 courses. The food was quite decent: I had the seafood croquettes for starter, the turkey for main and the dessert of the day. Service was efficient, but the attitude was a little supercilious. Whilst no-one actually said anything, it did kind of feel like the waiters were sneering at us for being cheapskates and opting for the set lunch. If they don't want people to eat the set lunch then maybe it would just be easier to not offer it and restrict the clientele to the higher end offerings (of which there are plenty). If you're the type of person who is oblivious to these things then this aspect won't bother you. Bring a thick skin and you may enjoy the overall experience. Food was decent
5
overall food quality still remains great. good and attentive service. Loved the bread and awareness of allergie
5
Deserving of its Michelin Star. The food was delightful. Pasta was delicious. The dessert we had was tiramisu and it is our favourite here. Even the breadsticks were fantastic. Definitely pricey but well worth it to sample Michelin Star quality food. Would recommend for sure
5
I love the place and the food.
The place is very authentic and the taste of food are amazing great. I love italian food.
5
Excellent traditional menue .. unfortunately the specials are very singaporean .. over flavoured and un authentic ... hope they stick to true italien food in the future
4
Garibaldi takes pride in serving Italian classics well. Generally, food was good and service was warm. A few misses with the food, especially with the seasonal pasta offerings but everything else was well executed. Best dishes were crab linguine, free-flow foccacia bread, and the desserts.
5
had the white truffle tagliolini and it was simple but amazing in terms of the cooking. the scallops was also well done but not wow.
5
Good quality food, service is good too. White truffle is really tasty. Desert is just nice, not too sweet.
3
Finally went to Garibaldi's with high hopes and have to say it was thoroughly underwhelming as an experience and I wont be going back any time soon. It all started well enough with efficient if not cordial reception on arrival and being ushered into a bland dining area with all the atmosphere of somebody's living room. Although arriving reasonably early at 19.30, a group arriving after us seemed to be getting all the wait staffs attention so we had to ask for drinks then bread and then service.Having ordered we then had to wait for an hour until our first of  course of steam Boston Lobster with Green Asparagus, Champagne Foam & Carelian Caviar.This was followed by Slow Cook Roasted Challan Duck Breast & Festive Chocolate Log Cake -all excellent if not miniscule portions. So on the food I think the reputation is maybe deserved but all the review comments about poor service remain very much in evidence. At S$600 for the Signature Menu including 2 bottles of NZ wine (so modestly priced),this was simply not worth it at all.Singapore has much better dining experiences to offer so my advice,seek them out first
4
Food and service are so so. Private Room is presentable and nice.Location is quite good, easy to access
4
I was there with a childhood friend whom I have not met for some time. I was really looking forward for a quick catch up with her over lunch. Unfortunately, the restaurant was packed and it was quite noisy. We could hardly hear each other. The food however didn’t fail to impress me. As for the price, it was on the high side; I do not think it was good value for money. It will be good if a more affordable set lunch (about SGD 60) is being offered
3
I expected more from a Michelin star restaurant. The food was good but sadly not outstanding. The service however was just unfriendly. The waiters were civil, almost with disdain, and there was no friendliness or attempt to interact personally with us as the customers. Really disappointing
3
It’s a Michelin star restaurant and it certainly lived up to it. Food was great! What I did not appreciate is being overcharged on the Burata starter. We choose the dish from the menu-ipong being asked if you would like the cheese with some salad we said yes.What was 28$ on the menu was charged at 90$ on my bill. All becos of some extra green leaves and cherry tomatoes. Apparently the cheese was milk burrata not just ordinary burrata.Whilst we appreciate the cheese some of us are price sensitive and it’s the onus of the staff to let us know if a dish gets charged a different price
5
Garibaldi Italian Restaurant & Bar has always been known for excellent food and service, and their weekend brunch exceeded my expectations in every aspect!
5
Our overall experience at Garibaldi was excellent. The food was what we expected from the 1 Michelin Star standard... The service was something I would comment Garibaldi for.. Will visit again soon.
5
Orders were served quickly. Wines were superb. They even recommended a wonderful cheese we could order thats better than on the menu. Price was not so different.. only slightly more expensive.
5
Everything was fantastic the moment we stepped in... The staff were very helpful and the food was fantastic.
5
The service was amazing. The staff were attentive and accommodating. The food was excellent and fresh.
4
For such a high quality restaurant we felt that the waiters were over anxious to clear our food before we had both finished. Perhaps less haste would help...
5
Went here to try how 1 Michelin star Italian food will fare. Surpised to see how good the truffle pasta was made. The appetizer platter is something you would not want to miss as well, giving you the opportunity to try all the appetizers with great value
4
The arrival and direction to table was great and receptive. The food and service was efficient and friendly . Food itself was very tasty and wonderful. Really pleasant experience . They have a cut off at 3 pm with staff change over so if a Ling lunch there may be an issue . It’s not well communicated to staff and too customers . Guess it doesn’t happen that often ! But cld be an issu

My wife and I joined another couple for dinner as we were in Singapore for a cruise departure the next day. Garibaldi was recommended to us by our concierge.The decor and service were both outstanding. They have done a terrific job of dividing their space into a series of smaller dining rooms so we always felt like we were dining in a private home. We were greeted warmly and seated immediately.The wine list and service were top notch. We especially enjoyed the help selecting a Brunello, as the sommelier was able to use a hollow needle to let us taste his recommendations before choosing. The wine pricing was very fair.My dish, narrow noodles with butter, sage, and white truffles, was excellent. My wife opted for two appetizers and her selections are the only reason this review is not five stars. The bruschetta was just average as the bread was not well toasted and just tasted like white bread. Her pumpkin soup was better but needed to be hotter.Our friends had a pounded veal chop pan fried in butter and a terrific pasta dish stuffed with pumpkin. The really enjoyed both of their choices.If we are ever back in Singapore we will certainly return
3
Was looking to have an impressive dinner after such amazing experiences in Singapore. Cold noodles with shrimp, Uni & Caviar are great, but missed a kick like being infused with something smokey. Scallops and eggs with truffles were missing a kick as well - and no I will not ask for Pepper in a Michelin restaurant, as the chef should get it right. If one doesn’t serve a knife with pulled pork parpadelle the pork better be pulled and not in slabs. You can certainly do more with A5 marbled wagyu and excessive fake plate cleaning just makes the plates look dirty. The chocolate fondant was good but so 90s without any imagination. Fruits tasting like washing liquid to accompany this did not help. Table service staff changed half way throughout the meal and the new one plonked a bread on my side plate I never wanted. Reminding me the grissini are far to simple for a class Italian, as is the overall bread selection (one type only).Why do you have plastic table settings if you change the clothes anyhow? Looks and feels cheap. If you only serve 2 sips in every glass mind you we had 3 bottled open in unison, (I understand local clients who only drink out of nicety prefer this) have the manpower and service to back it up or fill the glass 1/3 when you notice someone is really enjoying their wine. Why do tables get prepared for the next day including full table cloth change before 10 pm when those guests leave but others are only half way through their meal, rather than when you are about to close? It is imperative to have the right glasses and matching ice cubes at least for digestifs. Overall sombering experience, average food and semi good service, which considering the price is well worth thinking about twice..
4
Celebrated birthday with friends and the staff surprise us with a slice of cake! We had the set lunch and i really like the chocolate lava cake, it’s awesome!
4
Very attentive service, great choice of menu. A little expensive for lunch, overall a great experience!
5
This restaurant oozes class. From the decor to the food. If anything perhaps the service staff is a bit aloof but apart from that, everything was great! Food was top notch!
5
Compliments to all the ladies and gentlemen from the kitchen and front of the house. Great service from Lee and his colleagues who serve my table when I was celebrating my Anniversary with my wife .
4
We are visiting and expected a Michelin starred to be perfect bit it’s not. Actually its not bad but we have ever tried some better italian restaurants in bkk
5
We had lunch on 03 NOV 2017. Red wine was excellent to wash down the fish preparation. The Tiramisu was WAO!
4
Organised a private dining business lunch at Garibaldi. The Garibaldi team (i.e. Siti and her staff) was supportive at every step of the way, with the service rendered being attentive. We enjoyed our experience. However, the basic lunch set menu did far less exciting (and less value for money) following their 1*.
4
We were looking at the extensive menus they had and decided on the Weekend Brunch Menu. There were 4 sections with a list of choices in each section. When ready to order, I was astonished the waiter did not ask which dishes we want. So I asked, "Do we choose the dish?" The waiter replied, "No. We will serve everything". Pardon us for our ignorance but we all looked at each other and were all pretty shocked. Oh wow... so we thought it must be a tasting menu with small serving sizes. But no... the servings were considered pretty large. Just for the 1st section, there were 6 dishes and all were unique on its own least to say it's yummy of course. After all 6 dishes came, the next shock also came too. The waiter asked "Would you like to repeat any orders?" So I asked "You mean we can just repeat order for any dishes we want?" He replied "Yes". Our jaws dropped!! We didn't go prepared for a buffet so we didn't exactly reordered a lot. But I must say the dishes were well prepared and it is indeed very good. The "buffet" servings were indeed a bonus to us. Service could have been a little better as we had difficulty getting the waiter to come to us at times. Definitely worth a try
3
The restaurant itself has a bar area and a small intermit dining room, very well decorated. It also has a superb wine list with prices to match. That said, to be very honest, the food was not that great. We had pasta and risotto, both served with fresh truffles and both pretty tasteless.. Having lived in Piemonte (Italy), I can say this was what you would expect from fresh fruffles, or for that matter what one would accept at these very high prices. I have to say we were there on a Monday night and the main chef may have been absent, nevertheless, this should not be the reason for bland truffles.Cheer

Garibaldi markets itself as something special with its multiple awards and Michelin star. My wife and I chose it for our last lunch in Singapore before heading off in different directions for two weeks.She is vegetarian so Italian restaurants are perfect. She made this clear to our server when ordering. Garibaldi managed to serve sautéed spinach with a strong meat taste & smell. Sautéed spinach is basic vegetable cooking. Trust in the food was lost as was her appetite.The server cut short any attempt to engage in a deeper conversation beyond ‘we have not charged for the spinach’.We paid up & left. For a S$375 lunch I expect so much more
4
Service was attentive & impeccable. Food-wise on the whole are definitely excellent, a couple of misses but still a very authentic Italian cuisine.
4
From the service to the food, everything is unobtrusively classy. No wonder it attracts a good business lunch crowd who obviously appreciates its consistency.
5
Excellent service and so was the food. Very attentive waiters and waitresses. Do try the white truffle dishes.
5
We wanted to have white truffle so we chose this restaurant.
We had two babies in our group but all the staffs there were so kind even they couldn't behave well all the time.
4
Expect some pomp at this elegant Italian restaurant with fine dining service and an affordable executive set lunch. Service is impeccable and while the lunch menu is short of spectacular, it's nonetheless a good spot for elevated afternoon business dining.
4
Food 4/5. Value 3/5. Service 4/5. Atmosphere 4/5. Overall: Very Good.
Recommended for Couples / Friends / Business
5
A great place to spend with friends on the weekend - the spread is varied, quality is fantastic and service is friendly.The oysters and burrata were big, fresh and juicy. Orechetti pasta was done wonderfully without being too stodgy and the desserts were a delight to end the brunch
4
Garibaldi has been around for a long time and has served good italian cuisine with excellent service consistently. Definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it just cannot match up to the best in Ital
3
My friend and I were there to celebrate our birthday. Restaurant was kind to give complimentary birthday tart. Food was served sharing style and portion was enough for 2 pax. Burrata cheese and fresh oysters were delicious.Waiters were polite but no smile on their faces. They were too fast in clearing plates when I am not done eating. Overall, i think the weekday lunch might be more value for money as many mentioned
5
The food at this restaurant is notoriously excellent. Prices are also on the high side. Having a rare weekday lunch date with my husband, we decided to try the weekday lunch set at Garibaldi which was a steal at SGD39++. The beef cheek was to-die-for (you do need to top up around SGD10 for this dish). The sea bream I had was also perfectly done. Overall, a great lunch experience and great value
5
Service staff were patient & polite as they called to ask if we were reaching, instead of rushing us, they assured us that table have been prepared and is ready patiently.
4
The service was excellent. It was my husband's birthday, and they gave a special small cake for him.
4
Title pretty much sums it up. We were here on a Sunday to celebrate an occasion. The service staff was very attentive and the food was good. We had a good meal in a nice setting and pleasant atmosphere.
4
Going to Garibaldi was an absolutely wise decision. Great food, great service and a great ambience. this place stands up to its michelin star experiences. Kudos!
5
I thought the reviews were exaggerations on comparing Garibaldi with other Italian restaurants in Singapore and ranking it the highest. They turned out to be with clear basis. I haven't been to many Italian places but I can say that this is at the top of my list so far. Our small group went through most of the formal Italian meal courses - from aperitivo, antipasto, primo, secondo and dolce. We were too full to have coffee or tea at the end. Those courses are exactly what makes it grand. For my appetizer, I chose the wagyu beef carpaccio. It came with parmigiana cheese and rocket salad. Truly good appetizer. Balanced salty taste of the cheese and consistency of the wagyu. My pasta was a simple long spaghetti noodle aglio olio. Simple noodle sautéed in garlic and oil. I'm glad the waiter convinced me to try this dish as a primer to my main dish. Taste was light and I felt it was a good segue to the main course. I ordered the New Zealand lamb for my main. It was a tenderloin cut which came with mint sauce and potato gratin. Fantastic softness and taste of the meat. Not overly heavy on flavor and cut. Just right. I recommend this meal to those wanting to move away from the usual beef and pork selections. My meal ender was pannacotta in bourbon vanilla flavor, topped with strawberry and blueberry. That sealed the grandness of Garibaldi, for me. These meals were enjoyed with a bottle of Borgogno Barolo shared with office mates. Obviously, I highly recommend Garibaldi not only as an after-work spot with friends but also for that romantic dinner with your spouse. Guaranteed to make your partner happy. Parking is available right next to the restaurant along Purvis St. or a few meters down the road. The place is near City Hall MRT, about a 5-10 minute walk.
5
I went as a group of 10 and the restaurant provided us with a table at a quiet corner. That was a nice touch of them. All of us had the set lunch. I enjoyed my dishes (I had king prawn aglio olio as my main). However my colleagues who got the barramundi commented that that the dish could do a bit more spices
3
Business lunch became an extended tete-a-tete and food was generally agreeable. Tomato soup was good, rich but not cloying. My business associate's aglio lio was simple but enjoyed thoroughly to the last spoonful. My mushroom tortellini was decent, if just a tat chewy in parts. Cream overpowered it just that wee bit. Chocolate cake dessert was ace and based on that alone, I can forgive the tortellini. Was a packed place for lunch (reservations a must) but well spaced out tables meant no one was in on another table's conversation. Everything added up to Garibaldi remaining on my 'safe' go-to spots for a decent lunch unless something fancier catches my eye.
5
Prossecco that was free flowing, crisp and perfectly bubbled. Quality produce that spoke of summer sun & freshness. Oysters flown from the cold waters of Ireland. Service with a social ease to good manners delivered with energy. The staff speak the international language of good dining, of great hospitality. A truffle pasta that is calling me to revisit. Our brunch was elegant & unhurried. I don’t know that I will be able to do a buffet brunch ever again after this experience. Thank you
5
With all the diverse choices that Singapore offers, this remains our (me and my wife's) favorite. Many a times, after exhausting the internet for places to go on our special occasions, we end up going here - it's just optimal for us.Great ambiance, excellent and knowledge staff who can recommend nice things, a spectrum of wine (at all price ranges) to die for, dishes that are hearty yet sophisticated - and they will make you any dish you want as per your need and diet!And of course, all of them taste heavenly. I don't know why it doesn;t feature more frequently in SG's best lists. I mean, not every thing has to be super pricey to be great.Lastly - Great Cocktails.Revisit Likelihood - Always
5
Servers were all friendly, able to recommend the foods and wine well. However feedback than bread was cold but nothing was done? Love the appetizers of scallops Truffle shavings, octopus and tasting platter. Lobster was good too. And great that they had 375ml wine bottles for mini drinkers :-
5
Congratulations. Not only on a well deserved Michelin Star but on your continued delivery of excellent food, creations, ambiance, service with a smile and welcoming, proud staff. We had a fantastic degustation menu and each course came with expert explanation from Roberto the Owner / Michelin starred Head Chef. His passion for food, ingredients, flavours and easy sense of humour accompanied the evening wonderfully. This restaurant deserves your attention and an empty stomach before you get there! Thank you for fantastic food and company. Loving Garibaldi's

Friends invited us to join them for dinner at the Garibaldi restaurant. They stayed at the Nuami Hotel and we stayed at Raffles, so we walked to the restaurant, about 100m. Walking along the street, I was wondering what the restaurant was going to offer, when we entered I was sure that we were not going to have a good evening, WHAT a SURPRISE!! A really elegant restaurant, a wonderful wine list, great menu, very attentive serving staff, outstanding food and a wonderful evening! Yet again a lesson to me, don't judge a book by its cover
3
The food was good but not so outstanding that I would come back in a hurry, given the pricing and also the formal, fine dining ambience which is not my preference when it comes to Italian food. Service was professional but just lacking natural warmth from our waiter. I expected more from the food given its one Michelin star. The oysters were fantastic, and so was the spaghetti vongole, one of the three pastas we tried. My angus beef tenderloin with asparagus was just ok. We were given two portions of the antipasto misto, a tasting plate of 6 starters, which was too much for us; we thought we had indicated to the waiter that we wanted only one portion. We didn't say anything to this waiter, but I'm left wondering about the authenticity of the service.
3
In comparison to other restaurants we dined at in Singapore, this was a disappointment. The food was fine. The service was average. The wine list was huge but they didn't have the wines we chose so what was the point of a massive wine list (it was the size of a book). We ended up just drinking the sparkling we were recommended we we first arrived
4
I ordered weekly lunch set.Appetizer, dessert were good, but main dish was a little bit salty.Service was also good
4
We went to Garibaldi for lunch this weekend. I had lamb ragu and shared the appetiser baked eggplant with my friend. Both the appetiser and the pasta were delicious with a lot of cheesy taste. I recommend this place to all cheese lovers, and I honestly think the restaurant uses excellent cheese (there is no grease on my plate even though my pasta was quite cheesy). However, I am not sure if authentic Italian pasta has a lot of cheese in it.The panna cotta with strawberries was superb, the berry taste matched very well with the creamy panna cotta. In all, I really enjoyed my food at this restaurant
4
You're always guaranteed to have a pleasant experience here. Excellent food and very good service in an elegant atmosphere. For starters, I recommend splitting the 'Dream' (S188++) with a partner: so decadent but how delicious - cold angel hair pasta with prawn, oyster, scallop, uni and caviar! Having the dish on your own would be too rich for most people. Classical dishes like osso bucco and veal milanesa are prepared to perfection here; the former melts in your mouth, the latter is juicy with very light 'batter'. Pricey, but still cheaper than the top Japanese restaurants
5
Last minute decision to enjoy a lazy Sunday over brunch. Looked up the new Michelin list and found Garibaldi was open on a Sunday. No expectations and came away a real fan - at least as far as brunch was concerned. Was expecting to choose one dish from each of the brunch sections (appetisers, pasta, main course etc) but was astonished that the set brunch included everything so it was like a tasting menu. Even worked to overcome my disposition against seafood so had oysters for the first time and survived! The arancini was a hit as was the cheese tortellini in truffle sauce. Everything was excellent and the offer for refills was welcome but not necessary if you wanted to last the full four courses. Less impressed with the house wine choice with the free flow option so went a la carte for wine. If you haven't tried Schiopettino it is worth the splash and made a really great Sunday brunch truly memorable.
3
Food and service was decent. However, more is expected of a restaurant of this standing and at this price point.
5
Just recently awarded 1 Michelin star, been here a couple of times and quality has been obviously consistent. Succulent and authentic Italian food, service was excellent as well.Burrata with parma ham and rocket was to die for. Cold angel hair pasta with hokkaido scallops and caviar was delicious. Wagyu beef cheek with bone marrow and safron risotto was excellent
4
good service and ambient. went there with husband on a week day lunch. spend 200 for the two and no wine.
4
One of the best Italian restaurant in town, not the cheapest. I went there several times, no disappointment.
4
Food was good, ambience was great, service staff was excellent, except for the main course where the fish was overcooked.
5
I visited Girabaldi with my family to celebrate my parents' birthdays over a Saturday brunch.We decided to go for the weekend brunch. The food delicious and the portions were rather huge as well! Not forgetting to mention that you can have refills for the brunch menu! We loved how they used really good quality ingredients here! The appetizers stood out for us and we were really impressed. We even had a refill of the oysters which were super fresh and firm as well! The only thing that fell short for us was the pasta, but everything else was great!The service here was outstanding as well. I love how they offered us complimentary a drink (alcoholic), coffee/tea and a slice of birthday cake for our special occasion here! I would definitely recommend others to come here, especially for special occasions :
3
Service was excellent and the servers were exceedingly polite and attentive. The bolognese spaghetti and seafood risotto were decent - just not at the level that would blow you away (which i was kind of expecting at that price point). That, or maybe we just didn't get to order their specialties.
5
One Michelin macaron doesn't seem to have disturbed Chef Roberto a bit. Just that maybe Chef and his team have to work more! We came last minute without a reservation and were lucky, I do believe. It was a true little ballet of pleasures, the service unobtrusive and very efficient, the plates just succulent. We didn't have much time so ordered à la carte; difficult amongst all these classic and less-so choices. The beef filet was perfect and the frenchie Duck Leg Confit with Foie Gras cooked to perfection. Very good Nebbiolo by the glass, excellent espresso and good grappa. In short, another wonderful lunch - grazie

Wagyu beef melts in the mouth! Cavier, scallops and sea urchins are super fresh! Tiramisu was awesome and not too sweet! Complementary milky cake for the birthday girl was such a sweet gesture! Deserving of its one michelin star! Except don't order the fish and praws for main course. Nothing special

I've long heard of Chef Roberto Galetti's kitchen prowess and finally got to experience it first hand today. When you enter Garibaldi, you are greeted with smiles from every single one of the service staff. The tastefully designed restaurant gives the feeling of seclusion and privacy because of the layout. The walls shout of his accolades, but the food itself speaks the loudest. We had a set lunch menu. My partner had parma ham salad while I had a berry and vegetable salad for starters, both delivering a burst of flavours. Next up, I had the spinach potato gnocchi while my partner had the carbonara penne. Throughout the meal, the words that kept coming to mind were "respect" and "perfection". The chef truly knows how to respect the food, and clearly knows the quality and characteristic of each item and how to blend them together. For mains, I had the baked eggplant while my partner had the steak. Both delivered the wow factor that makes Garibaldi truly well deserving of its Michelin star. We ended the meal with tiramisu and strawberry panna cotta – solid deliveries of the desserts. Our service staff selected an excellent wine to match our food. The warm hospitality from the staff – and a few dead-panned jokes – made us feel right at home and we definitely want to visit again.It was not in fact, the Michelin star that stood out (I had forgotten momentarily about it), but the fact that Chef Galetti has consistently delivered excellent cuisine over the decade that is truly impressive.Star or not, I will definitely be back
5
Garibaldi has been around for many years and they have managed to maintain their reputation over the years.Service is very professional yet friendly. Food is very good - not just well-cooked but also good, quality ingredients. They also have a very extensive wine list.It's good to see they have been recently awarded with 1 Michelin star (although it means it will be harder to get a table for last minute bookings)

We were looking forward to their prosecco brunch but we found that the food at their prosecco brunch is not as good as the food on their a la carte and set menu. Still above average but not really worth the price if you're expecting a good deal after having their a la carte or set menu.The servings are generous, you get a menu at the start but you don't order from it, instead they bring a round of starters, a round of mains and a round of desserts to your table - you can order extras if you like. It isn't buffet or semi buffet style which is what I love about champagne and prosecco brunches.The decor and ambience are more suited for a formal lunch or dinner and not so much for a smart casual brunch. They keep your glasses full and the service is good but not somewhere I'd return to for prosecco brunch because of the ambience and limited food selection
5
The service was impeccable. The food was very fresh. Among other dishes, the cold angel hair with scallops was my favourite
5
I'm Italian, working and living in Asia since 2010 and I can honestly say that Garibaldi is my favourite Italian restaurant in Singapore . High quality and warm hospitality . Good job guys, well done. You deserve a successful future . Buon appetito.
5
We went here for a quick lunch and being pure vegetarians ordered a vegetarian pasta, I unfortunately don't remember the name of the dish though. The pasta was super amazing & fresh. Loved it.
4
Food was really good, five star quality. This is most important of course. Got a table on a Thursday night easily, but please keep in mind that they don't make exceptions on dress code. One star dropped for music (love Creep by Radiohead but there's time and place for everything) and for service pushing it a bit too far to be honest
2
I actually quite enjoy the food at Garibaldis, if this review was about the food I would rate it highly!I am writing because of the old adage of 3 Strikes. Today marks the third time that I have tried to make reservations online over the past 6 months. If you are going to use Chope or Quando please make sure your bookings ( Yes I have made them well in advance) are up to date!To call me and say that there are no reservations is very disappointing for such a good restaurant (only in food, not in service) is...just sad and frustrating. Also, it would be good to get a manager to call when canceling an appointment rather than a booking agent who just responds oh well that's all we have; is a tad embarrassing for a fine food restaurant
5
The service at Garibaldi is quite good. They have a standard menu as well as seasonal specialities, which gives you more options to choose. We went there for dinner with family and it was a pleasant experience. I was surprised by their enormous list of wines (it actually ressembles a book manuscript!): I think you can purchase almost any italian wine there! Their homemade focaccia with olive oil was really delicious and complimentary appetizers as well. Nice place for dinner with family of friends.

After my last experience I never went back to Garibaldi, in particular also because of this unbelievable management reaction back then (documented here).Now, last week, I accidentally bumped into Garibaldi again in the afternoon after lunch, and thought to just try out the espresso. I should not have done this: Diluted, without convincing crema, no particular coffee taste... and no accompanying water by the side.I find it just unbelievable, how an Italian restaurant - that prides itself being one of the best in town, - now with even 1-Michelin star - can so much fail on the ESPRESSO? What's more important in an Italian restaurant than the espresso? How can the espresso not be fantastic in an 1-star Italian restaurant? Michelin... maybe you want to have second thoughts re the star...??
5
The service was fantastic, the food never stopped and if you liked a particular dish you could ask for more. It is easily one of the best brunches I have been to and I have been to a few. If you want a quiet sit down brunch, as a two or four, without the bun fights and long buffet lines. This is the place
5
Had a business lunch there on Thursday. Service was excellent. There was a slip up in my reservation but the staff were quick to sort the issue out. We ordered the set lunch and both of us chose the cod as the main course. The items on the set menu were excellent. Will definitely return.
5
Garibaldi is in my opinion the best Italian restaurant in Singapore, and it has been so for many years with rare consistency.Service, waiters and hosts are up to the mark of this very high-end restaurant. They are very discrete, not intrusive, yet very prepared and professional. Cuisine is very good proper Italian - this is rare for Singapore: great selection and variety of a-la-carte menu, fresh products, chef's selection and tasting menu. The WOW! factor comes with the wine cellar which is definitely one of the best wine collections in Singapore. Let the sommelier guide you or choose from the big book, you will be delighted by amazing bottles. Last night, we had a 20 years old, 1997, Tignanello: it took proper time to open up in the decanter, and then it was joy for the palate. Garibaldi is no Michelin starts, no over-pretentious and over-priced, no show-off ... but true and authentic place for Italian food and wine lovers
5
came here for the weekend brunch buffet to celebrate my bf's birthday! the food was great and so was the ambiance. alot of variety and the staff were always offering more! we loved the desserts too
5
food and service was excellent as always, will always come back to frequent this place for business lunch
5
Garibaldi is one of my favourite restaurant. From the starters to the desserts, everything was impeccable! Kudos to Antonio, very professional and details oriented manager. Our experience was excellent!
5
No dobut, Garibaldi is best Italian restaurant in Singapore.
Food was nice and I like interior more than value.
1
We have had a few very good meals here but on this occasion one of the waiters treated us in an extremely demeaning manner. Having complained to the management no action was taken - we will never go back
5
Location is on Purvis street off Beach road, quite easy to find if you are staying in the hotels near by. Very nice restaurant and not noisy at all. You can enjoy the soft lighted ambience and have a conversation comfortably. Service is excellent as always.

This was my first visit to this restaurant although my wife had been there for lunch before. She had enjoyed her visit so we decided to go for dinner. For a Thursday it was a bit quiet although there were quite a few dinners. Worth mentioning that the pre-dinner drinks were very good. I chose the four course set dinner and my wife and son ordered from the a la carte menu. My starter of scallops with asparagus was very good. The mains of lamb chops also excellent. In fact, all the dishes were very good. The setting is elegant and the cost is pretty much what you would expect for fine dinning in Singapore. The only thing not quite there was some of the serving but the pacing of the meal was very good - not too long between meals but things cleared away promptly. Well worth a visit and I hope to return.

Free flow brunches are something of a tradition but also a necessity in Singapore. Why? Well. The inclusion of the alcohol can offset cost. This brunch is amongst the best due to the quality of the food, service and also the house wines and beers included in the freeflow. It is also in an interesting part of the city, good for a wander before and after lunch. We did feel the starters all came at once and it would be nicer to separate the cold and the hot so as to not have six share dishes suddenly appear. Huge plaudits though for replacing the oyster starter with another dish. We asked for a break before pasta, three lovely dishes with meat and seafood included. We asked for another break before mains of beef and fish. All this was seamlessly handled by the waiters. I had to ask a few times for a top up of my water glass, odd because the wine service was spot on. We didn't really rate the desserts, small tastes where nothing really obtained a wow or even a suggestion to must try. Dessert is rarely a highlight in Singapore though except in the most adventurous and global of kitchens. Overall, a generous serve of food and alcohol and therefore worth its price and worth lingering over a three hour brunch in a lovely dining room. I also know Garibaldi from corporate lunches more than seven years ago, so it is a proven performer.
5
With a bar at the front of the premises with great ambience the silver service dining area is separately located. The staff were warm and attentive and very helpful with our food and wine selections. The wine list is extensive and the portions served when ordering by the glass where very generous. (Something that is not always the case in Singaporean Restaurants.) Most importantly the food was outstanding
5
I was here for a birthday celebration dinner. Service from the doorstep onward was excellent. The restaurant staff were meticulous in their service.We ordered both the Chef's Dinner Menu and the Degustation Dinner Menu. The food were very fresh and tasty. I would say it is difficult to find an Italian restaurant of this standard. It could be just a personal preference, but do try it out and give your fair comments :)The restaurant also has a nice ambiance, and you can just sit there and chill with some wine and simple food with friends on any day
5
We didn't feel like eating in at our hotel so on the recommendation of the concierge, we went to Garibaldi. What a great heads-up! We had an outstanding meal and if we find ourselves in Singapore again, will go back to this lovely restaurant.
4
Food and wine were excellent. Ate the set menu and portion and taste were good. Italian wine were reasonable price. But for business dining, need to be seat in corner location for more privacy.
4
Good fine dining place serving some TOP quality food, nice quiet ambience and knowledgeable staff. Price is ok but some may find the portion size small. Deserts are not to be missed
5
Decent menu with many options. Food was excellent, delivered hot and on time (we like to go slow, told them so, and they were very accommodating). Expansive wine list - pricing was reasonable for Singapore.
5
We have been here multiple times over the past 10 years, it has never disappointed!This time round, we had a gift voucher and went for the reward lunch menu - perfectly sized four courses cooked with care (starter, pasta, main and dessert). We will be back again soon. :
5
Good set menu choice and that is fine for us as that meant the Chef focuses and dishes out only the best with the freshest ingredients. We thoroughly enjoyed the spread and the service. Lovely ambience and conveniently located.
5
This is our go- to place everytime we are in Singapore. The service, food and overall experience were all as expected; phenomenal!! Love this restaurant, will be back. Tried our the set lunch for the first time and loved every course. Phenomenal food. Still very very impressed at the very extensive wine list. The service is what makes the experience a memorable one, always. Stay awesome
5
Oh what a delight. The welcome, the wait staff, the absolutely succulent tartare with its perfect amount of black truffle shavings, the Mozzarella aubergines, the Pasta di Mare - even the red by the glass was great, not to mention the aged Grappa served with the double espresso. Thank you indeed
5
Garibaldi Italian Restaurant and Bar located in Purvis Street Singapore is a hidden treasure which is certainly one of the best if not the best Italian food I have experienced. When travelling home cooked meal are a rarity and so venturing out every night for dinner is a ritual and you will not be disappointed visiting this establishment. The quality and variety of the cuisine is outstanding and the polite service is five star. Please visit Garibaldi as I did for the first time in March 2017 it will not be your last if your a regular in this wonderful city and if just the ounce this restaurant and the ambience will sit pleasantly in your memory for a very long time. Five Stars for Garibaldi

After 10+ years living in Singapore I have had my fair share of Sunday Brunches (mainly hotel brunches). I so wish I had discovered Garibaldi's earlier. The Sunday brunch is nothing like the hotel brunches as it relates to a smorgasbord of food, but rather a fantastic section across their menu. They bring out 6 entree sections (starters), 5 Mains and mini selection of desserts. We also went for the free flow option which includes Prosecco, red/white wine and beer. The quality of the food was devine, and I think considering the way it comes together, it is clearly focusing on quality (although the quantity was amazing too). I often leave brunches feeling like I missed out on something as there is normally so much food on offer you say to yourself "I really wish I had tried this or that". In this case I felt 100% content. Without a doubt my new and to be honest, favourite Sunday Brunch location in Singapore. Can't wait to return
5
Perfect ambience, great selection of food for Sunday brunch. Waiters were also attentive and food was of great standard
5
No, not inexpensive, but worth the cost. Their wine 'compendium' is amazing and the food is good quality, service excellent and décor what you should expect to experience in a 5 star restaurant.
5
No regrets. My family already asking for another treat. The meal was quite balance, we didn't order the heavy 6 course set dinner instead we order a couple meal recommended by the restaurant. Good mixed of choice complete with the best beef in town.
5
Just down the street from the neighborhood-y Chin Chin Eating House is this upscale Italian gem. The pasta was fresh and the sauce delicate and flavorful. The wine list is expansive (and expensive). The interior is elegant and quiet. The staff was attentive and professional.
3
We went for the set lunch with 3 courses + coffee/tea.Although the entrees are nothing exceptional and we did expect a bit more than that, we think the set lunch is still good value of money. Their sparkling wine is great, the service is impeccable.
5
A proper Italien restaurant in the heart of Singapore. Garibaldi offers a range of excellent dishes to suit most mid range pockets. The service is professional and the front of house a genuine son of Verona whose knowledge of the fantastically stocked wine cellar is impressive. Decor is modern and elegant and the dress code requires smart casual. Prices are sensible but there is the opportunity to push the boat out if you are in celebratory mood.We went as a couple, were made welcome, enjoyed the ambience and the well above average cooking and would certainly return

Located in one of the busiest areas of Singapore close to North Bridge road, this restaurant is very easy to find. Very stylish, very spacious, clean, friendly and courteous, everything about it is class! We had no reservation, went there just because we heard some good reviews, and it was March 8, a reason to celebrate! We were seated at the bar first while the arrangements were made for the table, then we were escorted to a very spacious dining hall (one of the many, 3 or 4, or maybe more?) We ordered Angus Tagliata and Lamb Rack - both came served with some veg-es on the side. Ours were medium rare, and they were perfect! Simply superb! Compliments to the chef. The portions are sufficient, so If you are watching your diet I wouldn't recommend any side dishes, especially that while waiting they do offer warm bread and oil. We each had a glass of red wine which was an excellent Super Tuscan- again cannot recommend it enough, found it to complement the meat dishes perfectly well. For desserts we had chocolate lave cake with some berries on the side (absolutely delicious), and pannacotta- again very pleasant and mild to taste. Overall we spent over 300$, but this was the best lunch after a long time in Singapor
5
We were looking for somewhere special to have our last meal in Singapore on this trip, and were so pleased we chose this fantastic restaurant.The restaurant is beautiful, the staff very efficient in an unobtrusive way, and the food is excellent.Our starter of Capesante Al Tartufo (pan seared Hokkaido scallops with braised spring onions and truffled sauce) was presented beautifully and tasted amazing.Our main courses were just as good. The veal chop was huge and just melted in the mouth.The wine list was expansive, but unfortunately we could not indulge as we had an early flight the next day.A little expensive but well worth it.Highly recommende
4
Visited the highly rated restaurant for our V-Day dinner. Was restricted to ordering from either their 4 course, or 6-course dinner set.Overall, the food was good, and the service was adequate (probably due to an almost full-house)We will be back on normal days to try out their regular menusDecor was relatively dated, but nonetheless still quite posh
4
My last visit was a minor disaster and so I had recommended Otto or Amarone. But my Japanese friend insisted and so here I was, on a dairy and gluten free diet in a place I view as challenging. I was very pleasantly surprised. We all had the Chef’s degustation menu (6 courses) and mine was modified to meet my dietary requirements (very accommodative). As 2 of the 5 of us could only touch alcohol we had only two bottles, a very delightful Bellavista Grand Cuvee and a complex and interesting 1964 Barolo Giacomo (beware the wine list is unnecessarily large and our first 2 choices were not available). Dinner was very good and the degustation well portioned (not too much and not too little) : the spanner crab was delightfully rich; the Spanish fire prawn surprisingly aromatic; the guinea fowl ragout absolutely delightful with the truffles; and the mandarin orange sorbet a real lip pukker. Only the Hokkaido scallops were a little disappointing – not bad just not excellent. The service was very attentive but not smothering. From a “must I be here” it became “I am glad I came”. Cost me over $1800 for 5
5
Second Visit with my family in two months. Good Customer Service and atmosphere. Great place to choose for dinner. Will revisit again
4
I've visited Garibaldi a couple of times and the quality of both food and service has been great and consistent! Service staff are attentive and friendly, serving was also decent. My favourites are the atlantic cod and warm chocolate cake :)
5
I hosted a dinner here and was very pleased with the food and the wine offered. The service staff was very friendly too. Not cheap though ;)
5
Awesome experience. Nice quiet place to have an authentic Italian meal to celebrate New Year's Eve. Yummy and fuss free seafood pasta! And there's a waiter by the name of Lee, who entertains you while taking photos for you :)
5
Good food and excellence service.
One of the best Italian restaurant for date, gathering and special occasion.
4
We went for Saturday brunch and the food especially the starters were pretty good. The oysters were fresh (highly recommended to eat them with hot sauce or drinking alcohol to avoid stomach pain), burratta was fresh and tasty. Pasta was alright and mains good. The service was really the highlight- probably one of the best I've experienced in singapore. Will definitely come back again!
5
Always when we are back in Singapore we eating at Garibaldi. Never been disappointed... we know the Ã  la carte menue and always choose our favorites. We took our friends there and all happy.... sure... u have to pay some more money to get better dishes, service and location. Every $ worth to spend at this plac
4
I live alone so unless entertaining/entertained for business, my visits are solo. I can understand that is exactly not what a restaurant wants, particularly on a busy evening. Yet if one provides good service, then they are really good. Garibaldi is one. Last time I had Barbaresco along with parma ham, the pumpkin pasta with truffles with lava cake to finish. All were excellent, served promptly but without rushing which is again quite rare in busy restaurants. Price wise they are above average but then this place has a brand name now so we pay a bit for that. That also means it is always busy so reserve. BTW this review is somewhat late because I registered only now
1
We had heard good accounts of this restaurant and looked forward to our dinner there. We were offered only set menu options and were expecting a superb meal for $138++ for 4 courses as the Chinese New Year special menu. The croquet appetiser in a spoon was OK but the first course was a huge disappointment being the stock standard Singapore New Year Lo Hei, not as we would have expected an innovative Italian take on this dish. The lobster pasta dish was fine and the main course of veal with truffle and a bit of cabbage was just passable. Dessert was also a huge disappointment being a few small scattered pieces of bland cake, some half strawberries and a small scoop of mango sorbet. No petits fours with coffee. A single slice of rather ordinary bread was charged $3 extra per pax. Really??
3
The online set lunch menu looked pretty decadent and hence I made a lunch booking at Garibaldi. The items on the set lunch menu had different items as compared to what was stated on their website. It then dawned on me when my pasta appeared that it might be a 'Festive' menu. I was so looking forward to the pasta part of the meal as I remembered enjoying Garibaldi's pasta 2 years back. However, out came some grilled turkey and broccoli pasta which was just 'meh'. The meat was tasteless (hard to make turkeys taste good without marinating or drenching it in sauce) and the dish just tasted 'healthy. But I appreciate that they didn't drown my pasta in cream sauce and the pasta was al dente. I had the polenta cake with pork and although the cake had a nice texture, it was once again, bland to my tastebuds. The only saving grace of this dish was the bits of pork and cheese which gave it some flavour. Dessert was some kind of fruit cake with fig jam (way too sweet). I think I would have appreciated the non-festive items better as I remembered I enjoyed dining at Garibaldi before. Might give it another try soon. Unfortunately, my experience this time was just pretty disappointing.
5
This is definitely one of the best Italian restaurants in Singapore. It deserves to rank way higher. Valet parking is free. You pay only for the tips. The bread sticks were warm. The bread that came later was tasty. The olive oil was high grade; it did not leave the slightly bitter aftertaste that poorer quality oil tends to. There was a degustation brunch that we skipped because it was too much. We had the parmesan eggplant, a pasta, a risotto and a fish. They were all very good. Definitely ranking among the very best Italian in Singapore and among the best anywhere. But it's not fine dining. A waiter dropped a knife; the water was not topped up sufficiently attentively.Still, I highly recommend it.
3
So they have a weekend brunch special which is quite a bit of food. At $88, unlimited servings of starters, pastas, mains and desserts. And soft drinks/juices. Pay more for alcoholThe starters are good, including oysters and lobster bisque,and we re-ordered those. The 3 pastas were good too. Mains were salmon and turkey, which are good, but i think not high end stuff. Desserts were tiny portions but fineService is averag
5
good experience with the food and the restaurant. will bring more people to experience their food again soo
5
My husband and I are both vegetarians and Garibaldi has fantastic vegetarian dishes. We don't feel like we need to compromise on our dining options just because we are vegetarians.
5
Had lunch with my sis here last week and the experience was so awesome that I'm thinking when would be my next meal there! Had the set lunch (weekday) 3 course meal at $39++ , the food met my expectation of a fine dining Italian restaurant in SG, and at that price, I can't really think of any comparable restaurants. Service was prompt and crew were all pleasantly helpful and attentive. Tables were quite spaced out, giving each table some privac
5
Had kidd free Saturday champagne brunch, food was excellent, quantities just enough not to roll out of there... free flow was generous, loved it
1
Kind of old-school Italian restaurant with expensive standard dishes, standard service and totally overpriced wines. Why was I there? Because of a bday invitation. Did I enjoy it? No, as food was at the most mediocre if not questionable. Ingredients seemed not fresh, food almost cold. Will I go again? God forbid.Most questionable incident: the alleged complementary mini gazpachos (is that not Spanish?) served as appetisers without ordering, then appeared on the bill. Not ordered, just served and made us believe it's complementary- payable at 36$ in the end. Where I come from that's called cheating. All thumbs down for Garibaldi
5
We happened on this restaurant on a rainy night without a reservation and were welcomed without all the nonsense sometimes encountered ( indeed restaurant opposite wanted us to sit in the street outside for ten minutes despite the fact they only had two tables occupied). We had a delicious dinner - best beef carpaccio ever - and great service
3
Ate on a friday night.. they seemed short staffed. Plates not cleared promptly. Oyster from my caviar package not served until I reminded. Wrong Utensils given.
5
Chose to dine at Garibaldi for my birthday lunch, having heard great things about their food. Being cheese lovers, we had the Mozzarella di Bufala & Parma Ham (2 separate dishes) for starters and it was simply divine. For mains we chose the sea bass and tortellini, both dishes were right up my alley! Fish was extremely fresh & juicy, its skin fried to crisp perfection. The tortellini brought back memories of our time in Bologna, Italy, which not many dishes can claim to have done. For desserts we had the cheese platter and tiramisu - a perfect way to end off the meal! Not to mention the surprise chocolate cake with compliments from the chef, a lovely gesture that was very much appreciated. And of course, service was outstanding - we were attended to by Lee on that day and he made our experience a thoroughly delightful one. We will definitely be back
5
Fantastic Italian Restaurant with good wine selection. Cheese platter is also Super yummy. Good choice and best bet for me is steak and spaghetti especially the lobster or seafood.
4
Authentic Italian food, prepared with fresh ingredients and care! Set lunch is good value for money. Dinner is always busy, we love the ambience. Wine dinner is Super value for money!
3
we went there together with colleagues. think this place is better for business meeting or special occasions.
3
Staff are really polite and helpful, there is also free valet if you're dining here. We had the 6 course and thought it was alright. Wasn't blown away, but it wasn't bad either. If you have their degustation, they will waive the corkage of $40++. Best to make ressies beforehand as we were there for dinner on a Wednesday and the place was packed. Giving the food a rating of 3 only because I had gunthers (next door) a couple of days before and preferred it. Subjective though
4
This place has been my usual Biz lunch venue. I go there min. 3-4 a months for the last few years. Modern deco and they do minor renovation here and there regularly. Tables well placed with some privacy unlike some restaurants that u can hear the conversation of the other table ... Had their set lunch today...l like the pan-fried chicken & as usual , nice dessert of the day too
2
After travelling the world and eating in some wonderful restaurants this would have to be one of the most overpriced, over hyped that I have been to.not enough staff , not enough food . $58.00 sing for one (that's right folks ) one kurabata pork chop - 1 cm thick and approx 10cms long. Vegetables an extra $24.00 ! A glass of red wine $32.00 ! Not really a glass , it was a tasting poor ,!The staff incompetitent,, one particularly rude .. When charging prices like that you have an expectation of complete experience , not slap dash ,throw it on the table service. The mini pork chop was sweet and tender! That was lucky! Whoever is behind this place should retrain their overworked staff, cut their prices and return to a bit of Italian hospitality - your nonna would be ashamed! No happiness here
5
Had lunch @Garibaldi today and was delighted to find that it is truffle season. Had the Alba White Truffel Chef Menu. Very happy with the food, all very delicious & yummy. Chose the Hamachi main dish instead of the Angus Beef, sorry no picture of it, couldn't wait to eat it!!! Service is very efficient and friendly. Wait staff even helped me to choose a wine and they came round to check whether everything is ok ever so often. Like the ambience of the restaurant too
1
WARNING!!!! If you go here, check your bill. Or even better, go to Otto instead! (We also dined there a few nights ago & LOVED IT!!!) We travel a lot. And we are so happy to pay well for the amazing experiences we're fortunate enough to enjoy. Food at Garibaldi was pretty good, atmosphere's a bit whacky. The ridiculous discrepancy in our hefty bill has left a very sour taste in our mouths. Such a pity. First review I've written, prompted by the desire to warn fellow diners. I will never return
5
We were here and tried their Brunch at $88 per person with free flow soft drinks. Very nice experience and we enjoyed quite good selection of Italian food. Nice ambiance too. Service was prompt and friendly. The only complaint was the food a bit too much so we couldn't really enjoy the pan-roasted quail with pumpkin and walnuts. Other than that everything was perfect. Next time we think we'll try their a la carte.
5
So this place has been around for a long time and it's a classic. It's white truffle season and they have all the classic dishes such aS poached egg with truffles, scallops carpaccio etc etc on their degustation menu. Classically delivered. Service was great especially by the local waiter - sense of humor and very attentive.
4
Another Italian restaurant in Singapore with an impressive wine list! Boasting 1200 different wines.! The staff are passionate and knowledgable about them as well!
The menu though not quite as extensive, but equally delicious.
Worth a visit.
5
Service was attentive and good.
Food was satisfying and delicious. Everybody enjoyed their food. Especially the prosciutto and melon. The pasta from the menu was also a hit.
4
Had a nice dinner with great ambience. Authentic Italian fare, great service and food. Must try the Tiramisu which is nice.
5
Perfect. Wine, service, especially parmigiani))Near Raffles and City Hall MRT station. Corner with North Bridge road. They haven't place on the wall for diploma and winners letter
5
I've eaten at this restaurant many times over the years, and it has managed to maintain an exacting level of food and service. Dishes are exquisitely composed and the menu is regularly renewed to match the availability of seasonal produces. I especially recommend visiting during the white truffle season, around late October to early December.
5
The food is what I rated five. The linguine matriciana was good, with just the right amount of tomato.The seared scallops with truffles were sensational. The scallops were moist and juicy. They were covered in black truffle shavings.The tagliolini wit mushrooms and truffles were excellent. The homemade pasta was delicate and refined, served with generous shavings of black truffle. The linguine with Australian spanner crabmeat was nice. The chocolate lava cake was nicely matched with gelato and plenty of big strawberries.The minor service gap was:(1) I asked for drink menu as I sat down(2) An Italian guy then asked me if I wanted wine, no menu yet(3) An Asian guy asked me again if I wanted wine, no menu yetAfter I patiently I explained I was yet to be given the wine menu, finally I was able to order a drink after the food order was placed.Hope they improve. But I will still go back for the food:)

On a short week-end stay with our children we were up for some fine Italian dining and came across the Garibaldi, which was recommended by the concierge of our hotel.The place was exactly what we were looking for: an elegant, classic Italian restaurant. Nicely designed, with different sections giving some intimacy. Service was excellent from the start, as not only we but also our young boys got a very warm welcome. We were seated at beautiful table and started dinner with a good Negroni and fresh juices. The menu was very interesting with a vast variety of Italian classics. We had a antipasti platter that the chef split to fit the two adults and two kids. All was excellent, nicely presented and fresh. For the mains I had the Ossobucco, and it was one of the better ones I had in a long time. My Kids had two different Risottos, both again outstanding. Another highlight was the wine list. Full of the greatest Italy produces and complimented by many other good bottles from the old-world. As my wife doesn't usually drink, I was very pleased to find also an excellent selection 0.375 bottles. Finally, we had some delicious deserts before heading back to our hotel.Living in Manila, the Garibaldi is reason enough to return soon to Singapore - if it is only for a good Italian dinner

We have dined there on our last evening in Singapore as the restaurant had good ratings and was conveniently located near Intercontinental hotel where we were staying...The restaurant is lit with dim lights at night, making it very cozy but modern with very contemporary furniture and light features...The staff are very well trained, very polite and extremely attentive..The food was amazing with great presentation... so over all, It impressed me a lot and for me this was the top of the list of Italian restaurant I have ever been to....Very nice and highly recommending it
5
Several small rooms join together to create an ambience of intimacy. The luncheon menus are outstanding from a simple three course lunch for 39 Singapore dollars to caviar and champagne matches for 399 Singapore dollars. Parking is tough but they do have a valet in the evening. A must for any Singapore visitor

There's something about this place which is really magic!I wanted to have an amazing dining experience with my wife for our anniversary and the choice easily went to Garibaldi Restaurant: smells like home and the passion the have just makes everything wonderful.I was overseas while booking and I've gently requested to their Marketing Manager one personal favor: if was possible to buy some flowers for my wife. Surprisingly he made even more than my request: he managed to prepare the private dining room for us perfectly fitted with flowers and lovely music (my wife's favorites) and crafted some extraordinary dishes for our night. Moreover, right before our dessert, their Restaurant Manager brought me those flowers I requested previously so I could give them to my wife as incredible surprise!We personally believe that Garibaldi is the perfect and best place to enjoy a real and tasteful Italian meals, from their appetizers to desserts, you can feel like you're travelling all around Italy from your dining table!One more thing: their wine list is pretty spectacular! If you're willing to create your own private cellar, they may have the most incredible and precious wine selection in the whole Singapore!Anything you need to plan a romantic event or a friendly dinner, business lunch or casual meal, this is the place for you and it won't disappoint you at all

Love the value for money set lunch. Location and accessibility is also ideal for business meetings. Would come back again.
5
I had lunch with my boyfriend, a full immersion of the best and most refined italian dishes with amazing regional italian ingredients. A great service and cozy atmoshpere, really the best italian restaurant in Singapore.
5
We had an excellent evening at the Garibaldi Restaurant, with authentic Italian food, good wine and excellent service.
5
The food standard is still the same, service is good. The wine recommendation was excellent and goes well with the dinner.

A mediocre to poor meal and the Service was beyond terrible. They hover and make a fuss but ignore important requests about allergies. When the mistake was pointed out , they grudgingly agreed to change the dish but we demurred as there was other food to eat. However they charged us for this. Something should have been done and staff were passively rude and did not seem to understand how serious an allergy is! Never return. Sad because food was good on occasion but after such carelessness and contempt will never retur

This restaurant has been around for many years, and constantly rakes in good reviews, for a reason. The chef prepares elaborate and delicious Italian dishes. I've tried many of the dishes on the abundant menu, and haven't been disappointed yet. Everything is thoughtfully created and produces carefully selected. Service is discrete and efficient. The atmosphere is slightly subdued, which is great for a business lunch or a couples dinner. Don't miss the Alba truffle season, from around late October to early December, for some special delicious creations.

Stopped in Singapore on the way to Europe and wanted to try out the local Italian from Garibaldi.The restaurant is very well presented with a huge wine selection and extensive menu.Fresh ingredients, pasta and meats were on the menu.four if tried a variety of the food and it was ok as they have put their spin on some traditional Italian foods with mixed results for us.4 patrons, food and wine was $600 SGD for 2 courses was ok value, would recommend the food and service but wont be racing back
2
I used to visit Garibaldi regularly a few years back. Wanted to try again and went yesterday. One of the most expensive Italian restaurants and the bill came to $400 for 3 adults - Bottle of wine, 3 main courses and two desserts. Each main course is between $40 and 65. The food is not exceptional just good. There are so many Italian restaurants in Singapore where similar experience would cost $250 or less
5
I went to Garibaldi on a week night with two girl friends. We had drinks at the bar area before moving to the dining area for our meal. The staff were attentive and service was great. The food was also wonderful and I wish we had bigger tummies to accommodate the food!I had actually left my mobile phone at the restaurant but by the time that I had realized that i had left it there, the restaurant was closed for the day. The next morning, I received a call from the wonderful staff, reassuring me that my phone was safe with them. Excellent experience, and definitely cannot wait to go back!
5
I've always known Garibaldi as a high end restaurant that one would dress up to attend. We went during weekend lunch with a toddler. The staff didn't mind the mess that my little girl was making, in fact they made her feel welcome even ! Impeccable service and food ! Can't ask for more
5
This restaurant one of the landmarks of Singapore this is not the first time a very nice selection of nice Italian dishes . Nice wine card and very reasonably priced it location in the old town add to the your visit
5
We decided to celebrate our anniversary at Garibaldi restaurant. We couldn't have made a better choice. The food was exquisite and service impeccable. We were made to feel very special. Will definitely go back when we return to Singapore. Highly recommend this restaurant.
5
I have been to Garibaldi's for lunch, dinner and my favourite, Sunday brunch. It has become a regular for us. Each time I am impressed with the food, the ambiance and the service. For Sunday Brunch, there is a fixed menu of items, with our without alcohol. It is a reasonable price for Singapore and compared to the more pricey and noisy hotel brunches. The staff bring all of the items for each course and you can re-order any of the items. The brunch menu changes but on our last visit the Burrata cheese with heirloom tomatoes is always a favourite, as our the fresh oysters. The pastas are always excellent, and the mains, usually a fish and a meat, our outstanding. I've never had a disappointment meal there.
4
A very comfortable decor and an attentive staff makes you feel comfortable right away. We were in the mood to taste several pastas dishes and the chef and staff were very accommodating. The food is excellent and brings you back to Tuscany in a minute. The wine cellar is quite impressive. All that makes for a knock out restaurant if the final bill was not so high. S$550 for two for a few dishes and a bottle of good Brunello is a bit much. That is the reason for only 4 stars.
5
Their menu can be quite simple and does not change very frequently. But most of their dishes they do extremely well and my personal favorite is their cold angel hair pasta with caviar, which can also be found in their sister resturant, Gunther's. Impeccable service
4
My last visit here was easily 8 years (or more) ago, and it is still as enjoyable. Menu is pricey but it commensurates with the quality of food, service and ambience. We had the executive set dinner. Starter, pasta and main course was excellent but dessert was disappointing. If we go back again, we will try their ala carte menu. Pleasant experience overall
5
My family has been to Garibaldi at least 4 times and every time we dine there it is always so delicious. The staff are so professional and just the right amount of friendly. The chef is always easily able to accommodate any dietary preferences on the spot. Every aspect of every visit here has been a pleasure. On Fathers Day I took my husband for lunch and even the valet parking attendant was eager to help us retrieve our car as we keep forgetting they have valet parking service. The Fathers Day lunch was an excellent value for quality compared to big hotels, and so much more intimate and special

This restaurant has stood the test of time and appears to keep going from strength to strength. That it is probably one of the most expensive restaurants in Singapore helps, but the food is always expertly judged, perfectly seasoned and correctly portioned. Particularly memorable dishes include the scallop angel hair pasta, their Wagyu beef main, and the spectacular wine selection. Be prepared to spend though, as their set menu runs 188++ and the cost of the wines are only limited by your imagination
5
Weekday business lunch. I have eaten around the area but keep coming back to Garibaldis because the tagliatelle bolognese is so damn tasty! I don't even think it's a signature dish or anything, it's just insanely succulent chunks of beef cheek and ground... Perfect. And the 3 course lunch set at roughly $40 is good value, reassuringly pricey without making you wince. The ambience is great for conversation too, they've gone to great lengths to give each table space and cut noise with lots of curtains and fabrics. Just a solid solid spot
4
Nice foods using good quality ingredients. Kids friendly restaurant. Suitable for family dinner outing.
4
Well-staffed; excellent service: friendly, courteous and attentive. Generous with the fresh bread and bread sticks and with food portions. The steak and lobster pasta were delicious. Good desserts. Comfortable décor and ambience, conducive for lingering.
3
The food was lovely, the bill was steep. Too much truffle and caviar in rverything pushing prices up. Great white Gavi wine, a bit stiff and dated. For older people or business meals.
4
While looking for a restaurant with a nice ambience for good dinner in the off-track area when we chanced upon Garibaldi on a weekday night. The shophouse was larger inside than we thought and we were seated in a cosy room; whose cosiness disappeared with the entrance of a loud group later on. Service was prompt enough and the food good for an Italian fix mid-week, albeit a bit pricey for two people. For that price, there is a proliferation of Italian choices to make the rounds in Singapore
4
Was here for dinner after a long day of meetings and needed some down time. Did a walk-in and was waited upon by very attentive and cheerful staff. Scallop starter was well done - meat was excellently prepared but the consistency of the sauce could've been a little tighter. Seafood risotto was good - loved the generous serving of ingredients. Overall, this is an excellent choice if you love the quiet ambience (with background music), paired with good food and drinks
4
The table wasn't ready when we arrived but no big deal. We had a few drinks and waited. Good service all night long. Mushroom soup starter was very good. Mushroom risotto main was good but not brilliant. Good wine list and ambience. Nothing really to fault but nothing that memorable either
5
Was just at Garibaldi with 2 friends over the weekend and I am already thinking about going back. I respect the fact that Garibaldi works hard at keeping up with the quality and standards of the food they served and the efforts have shown. It was a Saturday, 6pm and already the restaurant was packed. One of my friends felt a little rushed to settle in, and as for me, I was way too eager to start eating. I can imagine how crazy the kitchen must be - the weekend crowd and restaurant week. Again, the pacing was perfect. There was a comfortable time between each course and only the attentive could provide such dedication. To me, this marks a great service. Food wise, the Sea Salt Grilled “Hamachi” Yellow Tail with Citrus Salad and Smoked Caviar was very much to my liking. The Citrus Salad to flank the Yellow Tail was truly clever. Fish is a very subjective dish and I simply enjoyed what I ate that night. Dessert did not disappoint either - Blueberry Cheese Cake, Ricotta Crumbled and Raspberry was light and fluffy. Last but not least mention - the Hokkaido Scallop with Smoked Tuna, Heirloom Tomatoes and Saffron Aioli is a must try. Eating is a lot about feeling and right now, I am feeling real good
4
It has been a few years since we last ate here (we were posted overseas) but it was a enjoyable meal, as before.Service was top notch, and staff were very attentive, warm and friendly.The seafood starter was excellent; like the Italians say, it "tasted of the sea" and was full of flavor and fresh ingredients that were cooked perfectly, such as two large prawns, squid, clams and fish. My wife did say a couple of the clams on her plate were gritty.We both went with the roasted chicken for our mains. Again, it was well flavoured and cooked well, perhaps too well as a couple of pieces were on the hard side. The roasted potatoes were very good, crispy on the outside yet fluffy within.Dessert was lemon meringue with tea or coffee. My wife thought it was a little too sweet, but I enjoyed it and completely devoured what was on my plate.Overall, it was a good meal highligted by the strong service, and we will definitely be back
5
I do the occasional splurge at a top-notch restaurant. At Garibaldi, it was well worth the price. I had a 3 course meal; 2 out of the 3 were exquisite and the other one was great too...when compared to establishments of the same level I believe this is great!Service was pleasant and efficient. We were well taken care of.Atmosphere is relaxing and homely- it's a nice option for a group of close friends; couples and families
4
The concierge at the Four Seasons recommended Garibaldis - we enjoyed a really good meal after several Singapore Slings at the Long Bar at the Raffles. Loved the burrata, bruschetta, penne with bolognese, and tasty sorbets. Why not give it a try - you won't be disappointed
4
Wanted a change from the typical Singapore cuisine this trip, so looked for an Italian restaurant and tried Garibaldi. We really enjoyed it. The ambience was excellent with music playing, but not too loud of music ... just right, and was like lounge music so quite modern. The food had a lot of dishes with shaved truffle, but my favorite was not there (with truffel I like fresh pasta dropped onto a wheel of cheese and scraped then adding shaved truffel). But my wild fish with truffle was quite good. A good wine selection, and the Sommelier had a true passion for wine (and he could recommend truly great wines in any price class ... me, I had to order one of the cheapest on the menu given my finances, but he recommended a Brunello which was really superb. I would go back to Garibaldi because of the Sommelier alone
4
Small and intimate dining. Evenings are expensive but their set Lunch offers a choice of two or three courses and presents great Italian food in an enjoyable environment. One of my regulars.
5
I went with my boyfriend for a valentines dinner at garibaldi, and we both left extremely satisfied with the alert and polite service staff, the ambience, the extensive wine list and the delicious food. My boyfriend said it was the best Italian food he has ever tried, and he's Italian! The stuffed burrata ravioli with porcini mushrooms topped with black winter truffle was perfection, it melted in your mouth. And the Dutch milk fed veal tenderloin was incredible. The dessert was heaven. They also gave a very cute cruciani bracelet from Italy which has been on my wrist since that day. I would definitely go again. Thank you chef Roberto! You've outdone yourself, again
1
Been to Garibaldi several times and always had a good time. This round is an exception as the service was not as attentive (probably due to one new waiter) - asked for balsamic vinegar (didn't come till we asked twice), asked for black pepper (took quite a while to arrive) and we skipped dessert as we got fed up waiting for our orders to be taken. For a great restaurant that serves good food and drinks, service is equally important. Quality of staff / training is very important and my friends and I felt that this waiter failed to deliver. I hope Garibaldi can do better the next time
1
I've been here before and it's been great but tonight was just a complete let down. Really a huge disappointment and a big downer on the evening.Firstly the greeting and front bar lady is awesome. The best espresso martinis in sg for a long time but the dinner service was a complete let down. Firstly. Had to ask for balsamic vinegar twice. Secondly. Had to ask for black pepper for the main and it finally came half way thru the dinner.The lamb was good and the actual food was good but we didn't order desert which we wanted as the service was nowhere visible for at least 15 plus minutes. A big shame and a spoiler to evening especially since I travelled all the way from Bangkok to Singapore for dinner with my friends
4
We booked our Valentine's Day celebration and had little idea how it would be. I had been to Garibaldis a couple of times before and had great food. We were greeted to sit in the bar before being seated in the restaurant. We were offered ice water from a pitcher, which felt a bit on the cheap side. The food was excellent, scallops and sea urchin salad on Capello d'Angelo pasta, fish dish with mandarins and grape, ricotta ravioli with bleach truffle, veal with vegetables and a white chocolate mousse for desert. We drank champagne and a very nice burgundy Clos de Chapitre from 2009. All in all 850 sgd. We had a great time. But today has not been so good with many visits to the WC. A bit of fever and weakness for us both. Linkage with Garibaldi is probable but not certain of course
4
Food and service are very good but very expensive (mainly wines) and the dishes are small. Ambient is good but nothing special. If you want to pay for quality you should go to this place
4
It wasn't busy and we didn't have a booking, but the antipasta and the pasta mains were to die for. Some of the best Italian I have ever had. Yes a bit expensive and service may be considered a bit slow but that allows for conversation so who cares
5
What a wonderful experience. We didn't have a booking but fortunately for us there was a table for 3 people and we were seated straight away. From the antipasto to the pasta mains the food was amazing. The wine and champagne superb. The evening completed by the excellent service. Will be back to try the brunch!!
5
Divine with no shadow of a doubt! Service impeccable, smiley and extremely well trained. Food is just out of this world - I went for a Saturday brunch and found it perfect. Price was definitely reasonable for all the great Burrata, Oysters (very fresh) and salmon. Would not hesitate to recommend and will most definitely be back
5
Really excellent Italian food with some good invention by the chef. Good starter and fantastic main courses
3
4 of us went to Garibaldi for lunch from work. 3 of us had the executive lunch set at 39 sgd per head; you have the option to pay 10'sgd extra to be able to choose your dessert as opposed to taking the dessert of the day - which needless to say being a person who looks at the dessert menu first always, I opted for. The 3 courses I had were the mozarella and tomato salad starter, the aglio olio spaghetti for mains and the tiramisu for dessert. Tiramisu was excellent, the other courses were above average in taste. Waitress seemed in a tearing hurry and coffee was not served hot at the end.My colleague tried the turkey main course - which looked beautiful. Another colleague who did not have the set lunch had gnocchi Gorgonzola for mains - that was excellent.If you order anything outside the set lunch you will land up paying around 150 sgd per head easy for 2 courses without wineOverall - some dishes were very good but overall perhaps not worth the high prices
5
We usually come here for dinner but decided to come for brunch this time. I'm not a big fan of most of the hotel brunches in Singapore; large buffets with long queues, many people piling their plates high with food, much of which gets wasted. The Garibaldi brunch is much more civilised; the waiters bring each course to your table and you can for more of any (or all) of them. One of the neighbouring tables must have asked for 6 additional portions of oysters and the waiters didn't even blink.There must have been 10 or 12 dishes on the menu, ranging from soup, eggs, veal, 3 different pastas, turkey, salmon etc. Options include brunch with free flow soft drinks ($78), prosecco/beer/house wines ($108) or champagne ($158).I must say that I enjoy this type of brunch so much more than the standard hotel version. It may not be suitable for a large group, but it is ideal if you want a pleasant chat, while savouring a delicious array of dishes, good wine and excellent service
5
Super Food, somewhat odd location.Stylish and well presented, friendly staff, good for lunches where you might want conversations.Understated, beautiful interiors.
5
If the Sunday Brunch is this good then lunch or dinner must be fantastic! Unfortunately I never got the chance to retune and sample either but not for lack of trying. The restaurant is situated in a very picturesque old style colonial road near Raffles. Once entering it is modern and comfortably chic. I was promptly shown to my table and informed that I could eat and as much of any course as I should wish and then if I wanted to retune to, lets say, the oysters... no problem. The house wines that came with the brunch were lovely but I asked if it were possible to choose another and so for the same price I got exactly what I wanted. All in all the service, the food and the ambience made for a very enjoyable eating and drinking experience... I highly recommend the Garibaldi Brunch experience...Please note that the restaurant has a startling wine menu too
4
We hosted our corporate year end dinner here. Had about 40 pax, and the restaurant handled well the service, pre-dinner drinks. The set menu was good, particularly the seafood penne.
5
Despite the proliferation of Italian restaurants in Singapore, Garibaldi's at Purvis Street remains my top favourite. The service is impeccable and the food remains, as always the best. In my last visit, I had a couple of my usual double Jack Daniels at the bar before being led into the main dining room. The young Malay lady server was extremely helpful. Given my choice of dinner from the menu, she suggested that I should complement each with the restaurant's house wines instead of ordering a bottle. My repasts include Carelian caviar with Canadian oysters, White truffles with poached eggs and Australian Wagyu beef with mushroom sauce
4
Visited the restaurant with my partner during restaurant week (29th OCT) and the set dinner which cost only $55++ was very worth it. I wouldn't rave about the food but for the price we paid, it was definitely good.. The sweets served during the tea was so good i felt bad finishing the entire jar and i was hoping for more. During dinner, we had the honor to be served by Siti, Pietro and another lady (sorry i couldn't get her name) at our area, their service was very prompt and warm, and i would like to extend my compliments to all 3 of them for working together very well. The service industry needs more people like them; professional and efficient!Why it wasn't a 5 star rating for me (a.k.a areas for improvement)...Due to the attractive promotion, the restaurant was extremely crowded and some of the wait staff looks very flustered. The host was a little lost when groups of people flood in. I was hoping they handled the reservations better as we were seated at the bar and we had no idea how long we had to wait. We ordered some drinks while waiting and it took quite a while to be served as well. The restaurant would have expected the crowd and more preparation needs to be in place so that the staff looks ready and steady.On top of that, the food and service would have been better enjoyed if the place wasn't so crammed and i could hear everything the tables around me were saying. I wasn't expecting total silence, but it was so noisy in the dining area my partner and i had a hard time having decent conversations and we were at the brink of having headaches due to the noise. We finished our meal in about an hour cause we just wanted to go out to grab some fresh air and escape from the "chaos".With that said, it probably gives me another reason to go back and i now wonder if the well received weekend brunch is as crazy as restaurant week. Certainly hope i can enjoy a lazy sunday noon at Garibaldi without leaving with a headache..
4
Went for dinner as it is Singapore restaurant week, tried the special set. I had the Korubuta pork which was done to perfection. It was a simple 3 course with a cold seafood soup which I was not very fond of as I don't go for cold soup. The main was the pork which I really enjoyed. Followed by dessert. We also had tea with it. As my friend and I both love Parma ham we decided to order a la carte to try but ended up w the Hokkaido beef carpaccio. It was very very good, compliments to the chef. Will definitely come again
4
Was at Garibaldi's to celebrate my birthday last week. Had the CARPACCIO DI MANZO ‘WAGYU’ and the Roasted Rougié Duck Liver for starters, and for the mains I had the seafood pasta and my boyfriend had the Tagliatelle with duck, mushrooms & port wine. They were all equally delicious. As for dessert I had the Tiramisu and he had the cheese plate; both were disappointing.The restaurant surprised us by presenting me a birthday dessert; it was a very pleasant surprise and it was greatly appreciated :) :)Service was excellent, staff were attentive and we both liked the ambiance of the restaurant. Apart from the small hiccup of the disappointing dessert, it was a wonderful evening. Would recommend others to go. And we will visit again... for sure
5
Best Italian food in town, perfectly presented by friendly and very attentive staff has its price. But worth every cent spent
4
Food was good, albeit a bit creamy and rich. The wine was very pricey but that is probably our own fault. Overall a good experience.
4
We had excellent mixed starters including oysters, eggplant with mozzarella, basil & tomato Sauce; angel hair pasta and seabass. We were indeed delighted by the experience.
2
We went to this Italian restaurant for dinner during Restaurant Week. It's got great vibe and good service. But sadly the food was not impressive at all. Presentation was alright, taste was plain, the roasted pork was not cooked properly and the bacon was hard like a rock. I understood the dinner set was a promotion set, for 55 dollars, so the chef probably did not cook his dishes wholeheartedly. But will I go there again paying a hundred bucks merely for its vibe and service? Definitely no. Please don't think you can jack up the price on your menu just because there is "Italian" in your restaurant name
5
It is well worth pay worth paying extra for this fine dinning authentic Italian dinning experience. Although the restaurant is a little pricey and the portions are a little small I do not mind paying extra for an authentic Italian taste.It is great for a dinner with friends. I will definitely be back
4
Ok so as top end Italian restaurants in Singapore go .... You have to add Garibaldi to your list. Great food - authentic recipes and really well executed. (Actually ... Extremely good. Best cooked Pasta I have had in Singapore). The service team ( front desk, waiters) were spot on ... Attentive, engaging and professional. Was there for dinner so can't comment on the lunches and the brunches but the evening ambience / atmosphere could do with some attention. Turn down the overhead lights, get rid of the back lit glass pictures, replace the elevator music, use some candles or such. Will be back ..... But might give brunch a try next time
5
I visited for brunch, which is a very popular weekend meal in Singapore. Garibaldi offers a fixed price brunch which includes as much food and drink as you could want. Differing from many other brunch options in Singapore, this is not a buffet brunch but al la carte - which i prefer, I dont like to queue for my food. There are multiple courses such as anti-pasti, appetizers, pasta courses, mains, desert tasting plates etc. You can order more of anything and keep it coming until you burst. The quality of food and wine is impeccable. This is really great value for money. Highly recommended.
4
Title says it all. Business lunch there today. Stylish room and the burrata with prosciutto and basil was great. Eggplant entrÃ©e also delicious. Beef cheek osso bucco with risotto also very good. Alcohol free lunch (sadly) so can not comment on the wine list. Will try it for dinner with my wife and discover the wine list
5
We went for my birthday celebration while in Singapore but did not tell the restaurant. They must have overheard us as to our complete surprise they presented us with a complimentary desert complete with candle The food is excellent with really top quality ingredients which make the whole experience completeProbably one of the best if not the best Italian in Singapore
4
This is one of the more upscale restaurants along Purvis. This is the upper end of Italian scene here in Singapore. Always offering holiday specials and special event menu's that feature particular ingredients. Such as the recent white truffle festival. A menu featuring the star ingredient. Interior is very nice, service is 5 star, extensive whine list. Lime soda is a personal fav, not sure what they do that makes it so special but I have yet to have its equal anywhere else. Freshly made pastas. Time to go back ! ideal for an upscale lunch meeting but also can be romantic in the evening for a date night. Then stroll over to Chijmes for a few cocktails to top of a perfect evening
5
This is our "go to" for fine dining in Singapore. Calm, elegant and very good service. The food is always perfect and, again back to the service, arrives at just the right moment.
4
Garibaldi offers fine Italian dining with an impressive wine collection. The food is flavoursome and you must, must have the burrata which is just so fresh. Usually most of the restaurants don't get this right but Garibaldi did serve the magical burrata.The chef sent us a small delicate soft dumpling with a truffle, I could easily get the fresh and authentic truffle. The menu is an ocean so do ask for navigation from the friendly staff. The wine collection is amazing and goes perfectly with the food. So , if you're looking for fine Italian food go here, you wont be disappointed
2
Decided to try this pricey restaurant for its convenience and the penchant for some Italian food. Fine dining menu was presented as well as a very thick and comprehensive wine list which took considerable effort to study. Wine decision #1 followed after around 10 minutes. 10 minutes after that, the waiter comes back to say there's no more in stock. Back to the list to select a second bottle, also after around 5 minutes. Well wouldn't you believe after 10 minutes, again the second choice is also not in stock.By that stage, we'd had enough, coupled with the fact that the dining menu options were also rather limited. Probably the reason why it wasn't that full
5
I'm really surprised there aren't more (glowing) brunch reviews for Garibaldi's on Tripadvisor. This has to be one of the best brunch offerings in Singapore, both in terms of value and experience. With a choice of $78++ with soft drinks, $108++ with prosecco/house wine or $158++ with high-end French champagne/reserve wine for 3.5 hours of free flow, this easily beats most of the big hotels in terms of price. And there is no wilting buffet here, nor any need to get up every time you want something! A set menu is provided on arrival, and essentially they bring one of everything and you can order more of anything you particularly enjoy during the 3.5 hours. All of the food was top notch, though highlights included the oysters, the burrata (couriered in from Italy!) and the salmon penne. The snapper was also perfection though I was getting ridiculously full by that point. A dessert platter rounds off the meal.We went with the champagne as it was a special occasion and our glasses were constantly topped up with lovely cold bubbles. We switched to red wine around the mains, which was a fabulous Chianti Riserva and probably deserving of a half-way switch if we had known how delicious it would be. Service was generally impeccable (especially for Singapore), though a couple of points seemed to be lost in translation. Nothing really to detract from the experience though. If you're tired of the big crowds and buffets of the usual brunch offerings, and you love genuine Italian food with a focus on fresh produce, look no further. You will not be disappointed
5
Very good food at this delightful and stylish restaurant in Singapore. Service is impeccable. The tasting starter of 6 different dishes on one plate (see photo) is very tasty. My Penne Arrabiatta portion was quite small but probably the best cooked pasta I've had (al dente to perfection). Not cheap but worth it. Wine is available by the glass.

We came here as a family for dinner a few years ago, well before I was reviewing places online.We had not intended to come this time but we walked past, it was lunchtime, we were feeling a bit peckish and we said why not. Great decision.The people with me both ordered lobster soup. I tasted it. It was the best I have ever had, possibly apart from one time in the south of France. They then both shared a spinach gnocchi with gorgonzola sauce, also brilliant.I went with seared tiger prawns - they were enormous. They came with lemon and smoked caviar. I asked for potatoes instead of salad. Easily obliged.The essence of Italy has been captured and transported to Singapore.A truly great meal and a fitting end to our overseas trip

Was brought here by a friend for lunch. Amazing food, great half bottle selections.If your planning to drive, you may find a bit of a problem finding a parking space

I've been to quite a few good Italian restaurants on the island but this one takes the cake. My family members and I think we experienced the best service we've ever had in Singapore at this restaurant. The food, the decor, and the atmosphere are all great, too. If I had to recommend just one restaurant in Singapore this would be it

My girlfriend suggested here for my birthday celebratory lunch. We were first to arrived so the restaurant was quite quiet but my the peak lunch hour all the table were occupied. We noticed it was more business lunch guests than casual guest like us. We had a glass of wine to go with our set lunch which was very nice. The service was impeccable and the food can't argued about

Having tried most of the hotel champagne brunches we decided to give this restaurant a go for Saturday free-flow brunch and thoroughly enjoyed it. We didn't book the private room but for 7 of us it was perfect. The staff were attentive however did not interfere with our catch up. Food was served family style, plentiful and delicious - if anything there was too much - and our glasses were topped up constantly. A great alternative to hotel brunches.

Very nice Italian restaurant with good selection of wine and beers.
Staff are knowledgeable, presentable, professional and high standard of service.
Food are very authentic Italian and exquisite.
Lastly prices are comparable to Milan after converting from Euro to SGD.

Good food,pretty buzzy, good decour ! Service was good as well no complaints. But again watch out for the price it will sting you
4
Nice food, simple decor and only few tables available, its better to reserve early.. worth the monies
Love chilling at the bar after dinner

What a gem.  Pretty high end Italian place.  Pretty formal old school cooking.  The portions were pretty good sized.  The staff is responsive, the food fast, and very good.  I had the lamb...very good tasting.  However, it left my stomach upset.  It might have been how rich the food was, or how rare the meat was served.Wine list is great here is you have the money to spend.  Lots of good wines to try for any group
2
Waiting staff were much too familiar. We came to enjoy a meal together, not talk to staff. Wine list was extensive, but not many offerings in a reasonable price range. Waiter unable to recommend a suitable choice in keeping with our preferences. Dining room split into sections, which is a good idea, but acoustics not so great, so that woman with a loud voice at the other end of the room was clearly audible. A young family with several boisterous children were leaving just as we arrived, thankfully. The sad part is that our meal was of a good quality, well conceived and prepared, as well as adapted for allergies. The chefs are being let down here. Guess it is a good spot if you like excellent food but have a noisy group

Its hard to find a restaurant that makes you feel good from the time you make the booking, all the way till the bill is presented. Garibaldi managed to do this. We had a very efficient and polite lady taking our reservations and we received a warm welcome when we arrived. Service was very quick and attentive and it was great to have a waiter who knew the menu well and could offer good recommendations. I cannot honestly say that this is the best Italian I have had in Singapore but it was still very good. Food was cooked well, presented simply but elegantly, nothing was over done or over jazzed up, and the menu is very much like the decor of the restaurant - minimalist but packs a punch. Wine lovers will find that there is a large choice for you to choose from, which adds to the overall enjoyment of the cuisine.For the food quality that we enjoyed while at Garibaldi, the price is acceptable and actually surprisingly value for money. A nice place to head to for that special date, without feeling like you just left your wallet behind

I've been in Singapore for a couple of days,i was walking close to my hotel so i decided to stop in here for dinner..I didnt expect to find an italian restaurant like this in here! The food was amazing, its not just a classic italian one, that's nouvelle cuisine!! Waiters are nice , you can enjoy your meal at best!! The chef take his time for entertain customers. They have amazing wine cellar.I think the value wine is $1million dollars more.I'm very impressed.I wanna recommed who love wine and food
5
If you like Italian food and more so if you are a vegetarian you must eat here when in Singapore. I was invited for lunch here and was most impressed both with service and food. Just lovely. There were also nice fresh juices, again for those like me who don't enjoy wine. Minestrone and the ravioli were excellent choices. The waiters make you feel valued and genuinely welcome
5
We thought we would give fine dining ago whilst on honeymoon and I can honestly say we weren't disappointed.Food was sublime and cooked to perfection. Wine was even better and had never tasted Sauvignon so crisp.Service was fantastic also, to welcome drinks and conversations with our waiter who advised on bits and pieces to do whilst in Singapore. Great night and would come back again (if I have a spare $400 SGD!!!

I'm an Italian, recently arrived in Singapore for work, and still I did not know this restaurant. I was invited at Garibaldi by a French colleague and the experience was certainly positive. We started with a Bellini at the bar and continued with appetizers and spaghetti with seafood, all accompanied by an excellent Franciacorta sparkling wine.One of the best spaghetti with seafood I ever had, but I loved all the products from the kitchen, fresh and genuine. You have to taste focaccia with olive oil: deliciuous.Excellent service, friendly staff, reasonable prices.I will come back.Rugger
5
Very nice place, welcoming staff and simple setup yet delicious food. One of the best Penne Arabiata I ever had, spicy hot but delicious. Had excellent cod as the main dish with beans, a great dish.
5
Beautiful Italian Restaurant. Nice decor and very attentive staff. We enjoyed our Italian Dinner prepared by italian chefs. Fresh seafood and good selection to choose from the menu. Will definitely return when we are back in Singapore.

Italian restaurant, nice diner with typical Italian dishes with Singapore ingredients. Amazing staff, although not all Italian ;-)

I've always heard positive reports about Garibaldi's and my experience of the set lunch didn't disappoint. No problem getting a table for a weekday lunch, friendly and efficient service and decent food. I opted for the soup of the day (which turned out to be a very tasty corn and lobster soup), the pork chop and the dessert of the day (chocolate mousse and raspberry sorbet). Cost for 2 of us was just over $90 (no drinks as it was a weekday lunch). Great value and hope to be back again some time soon
2
We did not eat here although we tried to. We were in the area, so went in to make a reservation which was noted but then they informed us that they did not accept men wearing shorts or vests. The latter I can understand but in humid Singapore an awful lot of men wear shorts, many of them very smart. If it had been an exclusive 5* hotel restaurant I might have had more sympathy, but this was a neighbourhood restaurant down a side street. We left
4
Was just looking for an outdoor place to get a glass of wine near Bugis. Garibaldi is perfect for an outdoor drink for a few people, for dinner I'd go inside next time. I chose a couple of starters and was treated to amuse bouche even so. My two starter dishes were great, fresh and well prepared. Most of all, the service was really friendly, helpful and understanding. I felt very welcome and will go back for a full meal with friends when I get a chance!
5
we booked the room in garibaldi a month ago cuz is chinese new year~special menu, all the food are delicous~waiters so friendly~especially the sommelier raj, the way he really lighten up the dinner,nicecommicuation with customer and the knowladge about the wine is really good~great dinner experinet
5
We had heard that Garibaldi's was the place to visit, we did and we were not disappointed. We were greeted by a young lady who took us to the bar. Shortly after a waiter took us to a table, we had not made a reservation, maybe we should as they seem quite busy. The food was delicious and the wine, albeit a little expensive was first class and worth the money. The attentiveness give by Zol our waiter was excellent

We went there to have the NYE family dinner of 6 adults. We knew that it's pricey that's why we wanted to keep it to a minimum when it comes to ordering food. In addition, my mother isn't a big fan of Italian food, that's why we're sharing food. As we were ordering, the waiter kept insisting that we couldn't or rather should not share the food as the portion was small, just enough for one person. We kept telling him that we, the women, didn't eat much, so it's gonna be a waste. But nooo, he kept insisting on one main plate for each person. On top of that, he also kept insisting on us having the truffle appetizer, which we ordered and shared. We were not informed that the White truffle shaving was extra, although I read through briefly on the menu on how much it cost. When the appetizer plates came, this waiter came with the truffle and weighing scale, showing us how much it was before.. Again, didn't explain how much it's gonna cost. Then he began shaving the truffle.. He shaved A LOT! Just the truffle itself cost us $244!! It's ridiculous! We didn't need that much truffle, some of us didn't even like it and ended up throwing it away.. Such a waste.. We thought he was being generous since it's end of the year celebration or something.. The whole experience could be a lot better if this particular waiter didn't insist on us blowing up our wallet and belly!Don't get me wrong, the food was excellent.. We would definitely come back, but this time we just have to be more firmed on what we want
5
This restaurant was recommended to us by our hotel (Grand Hyatt), and we were sure to thank them upon our return. We had an incredible dinner at this restaurant - some of the nicest Italian cuisine I've ever had. As a party of four we shared the tasting plate for entree - this was such a great option. Also, the pumpkin ravioli was to-die-for. The chef really understands portions because our entire party left completely satisfied, but never too full.Thanks for a brilliant dining experience in Singapore
5
The best Italian food ever especially the penne arabiata wich tasted divine and not too spicy either please go there and the waiters are lovely
5
My wife and I went to the Garibaldi and had one of the best meals we have had in Singapore in our five year stay here. From the moment we entered the restaurant we were treated like royalty. We had a delicious cocktail while we waited for our table. The whole meal was exceptional from the appetiser to dessert. My wife said her Lobster Linguine was to die for and then she went to heaven when she had her favourite dessert of pannacotta. We will definitely be frequenting this restaurant more often and would definitely recommend it to family and friends for exquisite dining

Been here many times but the last visit was very disappointing, it's a shame to see Management tarnish this once great Restaurant. This is the 1st time I have been motivated to write a negative review for ANY Restaurant I have EVER visited around the world. The general feel from the Manager & blonde female, working the reception area was nothing short of extreme rudeness, they both struck me as immature, with more than healthy egos which were inflated by their own delusions of Grandeur. It's a shame when success goes to people heads, I can't wait to head back to the many other options in the area to a Restaurant that values its customers & makes them feel welcomed from the moment you enter, instead of the over the top snobbery I experienced @ Garibaldi the other day..
5
Booked this restaurant for lunch with friends - been past many times but it just looked like a bar so didn't realise it was a restaurant too. So, on arrival met by charming hostess who showed us to our lovely table - the place is quite large beyond the bar and the tables are beautiful. They have plenty of choice and we chose the $39++ menu - everything was delicious! Three choices of starters and mains - option to top up for other dishes and wonderful dessert of the day.Excellent, attentive service from James. No one rushed us to leave and everyone we met was just delightful.Highly recommended
4
Went there for an end of year Xmas set lunch and it was superb. The first dish of scrambled eggs with white truffles was divine. The water chestnut duck ragout, king prawns with caviar and finally the chocolate dessert brought the festive cheer on. The whole meal was an experience for the palate, subtle rich but not indulgent. Reasonable sgd88 ++ per pax One of my favorite Italian restaurants in Singapore that don't disappoint.
4
Our Hotel concierge booked this restaurant for us and described it as a very good Italian restaurant. Well I think he undersold the establishment. We arrived and immediately sensed that this was a professional establishment and that we would be in for a very good evening.The food is absolutely delicious and without pretensions. The service is impeccable.We had a fantastic evening and it was worth noting that on a Sunday evening all the tables were full.This was a perfect way to finish our Singapore sojourn. We shall return next time we are in Singapore
5
Garibaldi has been serving consistently excellent Italian food for a long time. The prices are very fair and for a fine dining restaurant, their wine prices are not extortionate (to me, a yardstick for a good restaurant). The service is alway attentive, not overbearing and the waiters are very friendly. We went for a white truffle binge and the portions were generous and again, the price very fair. No wonder this is one of the favourite restaurants for many locals who appreciate good Italian food. Garibaldi is certainly worth visiting once you have your fill of chicken rice and satays

I have eaten here on quite a few occasions but this my first review. Most recently I came here together with a group of friends during restaurant week but half of the group chose to order ala carte rather than have the fixed course menu. Because of this I got to sample quite a few different dishes. Now what was interesting was that I had just returned from a visit to Central Italy three days ago and had some very good meals there. I was eager to see whether the meals in Garibaldi would be comparable to my experiences. My verdict was that the dishes in Garibaldi are competently executed using quality ingredients and was close to what I had in Italy. The servers were polite and well-trained although slightly less responsive than usual as they were kept very busy in a full restaurant. It is also a good sign to see the same restaurant staff year in year out in this very tough labour market -kudos to the restaurant management. As an aside I had a bit of a shock with the prices of the wine, having just visited the vineyards/wine estates of the Chianti Classicos and Montalcinos/Montepulcianos but then I realised this is Singapore after all.To round it off, Garibaldi has been around a long time and the food and service here is consistently good - it is one of the few places I will go to for Italian food in Singapore
5
Visited garibaldi as part of restaurant week...when it falls into my budget range but definitely well worth a visit.Was very pleasantly surprised with the generous portions.Food is beautifully plated so a treat for the those who love taking pictures of their meals.Starter was a trio of foie gras, smoked duck breast and a duck liver mousse.considering the special budget for restaurant week, the portion of the foie gras was huge and expertly seared !!Mains were hearty and had a deep comforting taste.very rich and flavourful.The set dessert was light and we added the tiramisu...Again for tiramisu lovers, this is a wonderfully creamy version .Wine by the glass was pretty expensive, more so when we compared it to the cost of our meal but probably about right when you dine there outside of this promotion, so beware if you are on a budget
4
This is my thrid time to this resturant and the experience has been the same. The food is amazing. We had the oso bucco and a steak. Both dishes were perfectly done. The service on the other hand has always felt lacking. Wine glass stays empty for long periods of time. Have to hunt the waiter to place the order. Maybe because we are a large group the service is slow. But that is not an excuse.
4
Very pleasant surroundings for lunch with good service and pleasant and attentive staff with a delicate rendition of Italian food cooked to perfection. Wine is on the expensive side but it is Singapore. Will return on my next visit.
5
Modern but cosy, friendly and efficient staff and waiters, great menu. The chefs suggestions are worth following. Creative and traditional wrapped in one. The only down side is a wine list that takes half an hour to go throughâ€¦.. but contains some great wines!Well worth a visit!
5
I've been a frequent diner at Garibaldi for over a decade. It's my favourite Italian restaurant in Singapore. Chef Roberto changes his menu often, adding in seasonal items. I particularly enjoy his risotto dishes. For appetisers you should try his Hokkaido scallops, cold pasta with oyster and caviar, carpaccio, or fresh oysters. Last week I had imported Turbot, one of his special fish dishes. that night it was accompanied with cauliflower puree, but he will vary the vegetables to suit the diner. He has an extensive wine list which is reasonably priced for Singapore. Service is always excellent and the background music is just that! It's in the background, making this a perfect venue for a private or work related conversation
4
We enjoyed a nice and relaxin dinner with great wines. We had a 5 course dinner with a great mix of seafood and meat. Only thing to claim is the time in between the courses that could have been a bit longer. Otherwise a very nice treat for a dinner. The chocolate cake was wonderful
5
Garibaldi is one of the best top end Italian restaurants that I have experienced in my travels. Both the food and wine offerings are ingeniously authentic as well as satisfying. Perhaps the menu could be simplified- no need of so much options. Both antipasti and primi that I selected were perfectly made and delicious - the prosciutto on gnocco fritto blew my mind.Service is excellent and ambience relaxed yet cool. I am glad I have been to this place twice and I am planning to replicate.
5
This is a very good italian restaurant with a great atmosphere. They play good italian music, serve you tasty bread with olive oil as a snack while waiting for the main dish. I ate here a few times and i liked every dish. They also have a bar at the entrance where you can get your espresso or "aperitivo" italian style. If you are homesick, eat here. Book in advance
4
There's a lot of attention to detail about the food here, using premium ingredients and upholding the best traditions of Italian cuisine. The risotto in particular is very good, made from a prized organic carnaroli rice. It's also one of those rare places in Singapore you can take your own wine, although their list is quite extensive. The service is good and the atmosphere pleasant. A very easy place to spend a few hours with friends chatting over generally well-executed food. None of the dishes we tried were particularly breathtaking but they were enjoyable
5
Was here for friends wedding lunch.... The food was fantastic, service great...... An awesome day for an amazing couple. Thanks for making their day a success

I've traveled to Singapore approximately five times now and it is always a challenge to find "foodie food" Well this time around it finally happened a restaurant I can write home about. Garibaldi is by far the best restaurant I have eaten at in Singapore in all of my stays in the country. The food was spectacular and the service just as impressive. This is a a place that you can have a nice date night meal or business meal. I truly hope you enjoy as much as I did. If I return to Singapore, this is at the top of my list
5
I love Italian food and this place didn't disappoint. Delicious food, including Veal Milanese perfectly cooked. Portions are generous and we had no room for a dessert which was annoying! Great wine list, although took my own and paid a reasonable corkage. It's actually very reasonable for the quality of food and service. Staff are exceptional, will go back next time we are in Singapore
4
Thank you for the great dining experience. Will definitely be back for more good food and service. Well done to the team.
Especially the Chef who put up a really great food for us

I had a private dinner at garibaldi. The service is very good. They even made me two menus, one normal and one vegetarian, at no extra cost. The service is very good. The staff are attentive but not too much. The best part for me was the entree. It was this 3 part thing with spinach and roasted nuts. The seafood pasta was good, next time I will have this as risotto. The lamb was ok. Very good wine selection too. The private dining area is very nice and intimate. Perfect for everyone. My only complaint is they over billed me. I emailed the garibaldi. They said they will refund my account. But up to now no refund. It's been 4 weeks.
4
Came here again for a birthday celebration and once again, the food did not disappoint. We ordered 2 starters, 5 mains, 2 desserts, only one glass of wine, 4 cups of tea and coffee, and the overall bill came up to $300+ for a group of 5 which I thought was quite reasonable. The place was nicely lighted with warm lights, not too bright and had a romantic feel to it (candlelights would be great for couples but I came with friends). Would certainly come back for a date night soon.
4
We have been to Garibaldi's bar a few times and we very much like the relaxed, quite atmosphere, which makes it an ideal place for having conversations with friends. The finger-food is tasty and the drinks selection is great. We especially love the Parmigiano-Reggiano that is handed out as a snack with the drinks
5
This was an excellent Italian restaurant almost just around the corner from Raffles Hotel. The pastas, salads, entrees, all were as good as anything we have eaten in Italy. Truffles are used in more than a few dishes. Everything is fresh! Nothing was overcooked. The wine list was as comprehensive as any fine restaurant anywhere in the world. When you want to have a fine meal in Singapore, this is the plac
4
Had a lunch with some business associates. Ordered the set lunch for convenience, turned out really, really good for S$68.The parma with Sicilian melon was excellent, the aglio olio was good too. The slow-cooked Wagyu cheek has to be one of the best I've had in Singapore, and the tiramisu... well it is Garibaldi, and it was decent.The service was efficient without being obtrusive, always anticipating, but never hurried.Great lunch overall. Will definitely be back
5
When a chef is passionate about his food, it always shows when you dine at such a restaurant.Chef Roberto Galetti has such a passion and it shows in his cuisine.Since focusing solely on this restaurant a year and a half ago, he has lifted the quality of his food considerably as he no longer has other restaurants to divert his attention to.Top quality seasonal produce features strongly on hism menu and in addition to the great a la carte selection he often has seasonal as well as daily specials.Topping off the gustatory experience is a fine selection of noteworthy wines and impressive vintages.Go there for a dinner with friends, a romantic occasion or to celebrate a special event
4
The excellent experience starts from the time one steps in- very warm gracious welcome, array of exquisite wine on display, amazingly awesome food and service and super quick service at that, decent charges... one can spend a complete evening ther
4
Have been a fan of Garibaldi Restaurant for the last 7 years and every time we are in Singapore we pay them a visit!!What they need is to be congratulated on, is their consistly good food. Every time we are there they get it right. This time I had one of the best pappardelle with beef cheeks that I have ever tasted!!!In addition we always travel with our 9 year daughter who always wants something totally different from what's on the menu, Not A Problem she gets exactly what she wants with no fuss!Keep up the good work and of course we will be back on our next trip to Singapore!
5
I was treated to dinner here by some business colleagues - the experience was a delight - from solid, attentive service to exceptional meals
3
Went to Garibaldi for a "special" dinner on our last holiday night. Two of our party of four are gluten intollerant. The restaurant confirmed that they had gluten free options but the way they dealt with the issue was not by providing a substitute but by leaving it off - no amuse bouche, no bread for the gluten intollerant. On top of that offhand waiters and indifferent service. A very expensive disappointment
4
It was my first visit to this restaurant, highly-recommended by a friend who was with me for dinner. I had high expectations as my friend knows his fine dining. But for the first time ever, it seems to me he was off the mark this time.The service was very good, don't get me wrong. I was there at their bar for an early drink before dinner, while waiting for my friend to show up, and I was really impressed by the ambience and setting of the place. The "doorman" who had greeted me when I first arrived, was fantastic and I noted that he greeted even every passerby who so much as walked past the restaurant, "Good Evening." The fruit punch I had tasted very good too, but then food-wise that was as far as the "good" goes.We were shown to our table for dinner, service was impeccable and all. But when the food came, I was disappointed. I had a 3-course meal of roasted foie gras, veal ravioli and molten lava cake. None of these 3 made me clap my hands in joy.First, the foie gras. As buttery and wonderful foie gras is, this one was presented looking as though the goose from where the liver came from, was malnutritioned. It wasn't supple and smooth at all, and worse, when I was cutting through it, more than once I found myself having to grind my knife against the plate to cut through the roasted skin of the foie gras. Not what I expected when eating this particular food; foie gras should always cut smoothly and easily.Then, the veal ravioli. While the taste was nice, it appears my ravioli had probably sat in the kitchen for a while too long, before it was actually served to me. It wasn't as hot as it should be if freshly-served, and maybe that's why the flour of the ravioli was slightly tough to bite on.Lastly, my dessert of molten lava cake. I love my lava cakes, and it gives me joy each time, to cut into one and see the molten chocolate spurt and flow. But once more, it seems to me my dessert may have been sitting a while in the kitchen before it was brought out to me. The molten chocolate was thick by then, hardly flowing at all. Even the vanilla ice cream served on the side looks a bit melted too, so go on, take a wild guess how long it's been sitting in the open air.And just for the record, the restaurant was not packed. It was probably about half-full at that time, so they have no excuse to be delaying the serving of the food.So while I give great credit to Garibaldi's service to its patrons in the dining halls, it seems they need to take note how long a dish had been left sitting in the kitchen before being served

The restaurant is set on Purvis St a stone' throw from Raffles Hotel. There is a smart cocktail bar which you walk through to get to the dining area. The staff are amazingly pleasant and welcoming. There is a classy atmosphere to this restaurant accented by the quality of staff and service. The menu is extensive with some usual favourites (e.g. Carpaccio with rocket leaves and Parmesan) along with a range of pastas, risotto, fish and meat. I had the fettuccine pomodoro followed by the lamb loin. The pasta serving was small (a true starter). It was well cooked but unfortunately rather bland for my taste. The lamb was very well presented and cooked to perfection. My wife had the carpaccio and the cod. Both looked and tasted very nice. The cost came to nearly S$200 without wine, dessert or coffee. Rather expensive. I would recommend 'no menu' ahead of Garibaldi for an overall offering
5
Just returned from one of the nicest meals I've ever had.Part of Singapore restaurant week, at $55 so therefore the two of us had restricted menu, with only a choice of main courses. A slight delay for our table, but we were given glass of prosecco each.The starter was the most delicious and imaginative scallop dish I have ever tasted.Everything I tasted was delicious. Service was good. Can't fault the place. Cheapest bottle of white wine was $75. Would be v pricey outside restaurant week, but worth it
3
We've had the same waiter last two visits and it's ruined what used to be one of our favourite rextaurants. This time Raj was assigned to us when we asked for sommelier help which was a complete joke since he couldn't tell that the wine was off. Here are my favourite quotes, "the cloudiness is normal for this type of wine" and "I had a coffee before I started work so I couldn't taste the off wine". Food was excellent as always but we'll be going to other restaurants in the future where we can get better waiters ... Like Gunthers next door
5
Me and my wife book a table for 2 persons at Garibaldi Restaurant for 8.30 pm. We were shock when we arrived at the restaurant to see how crowded the restaurant at that time. Well it shows how popular the restaurant is. We squeeze our way through to see the usher at the door to inform her that we have arrived for our reservation but we were told to wait for a while for our table. At the same time she was nice enough to offer us 2 glasses of prosecco complimentary while waiting. 30 minutes have passed and we are still waiting, I'm getting frustrated and I'm losing my patience. The door still full of people and my wife told me, "If it's so popular and there are lots of people waiting for their seats then it must be worth waiting". Well, to please my wife on Valentine's Day, I tried my best to keep my cool. We were seated almost at 9.30 pm. The restaurant was so full and I can see that the waiters are busy running around. After being seated for 15 minutes, then a waiter came to our table. He was nice and smiley even though he was trying to catch his breath from running around. Our orders were taken. Although the food and service were very slow for my preference but the waiter and the delicious food made up for it. The waiters are polite and smiley not like some other restaurant that I've visited where the waiters are so arrogant and the food although small portion it was nicely presented. I like the Roasted Duck which I was told from France was so delicious and tender. Also my favourite is the Chocolate Mousse which is made of Varlhona Chocolate and I know it is one of the best Chocolate in the world, it melts in the mouth and I can tasted the delicious sweet and bitterness of the chocolate. By the time we finish our dinner it was pass midnight. But it is worth waiting for. Thanks Garibaldi for making the night pleasant for me and my wife

We looking forward for our second Valentine dinner at Garibaldi!!! When we arrive at the entrance, there were about 30 couples waiting for their tables!! My husband was already panicking and worried of the long waiting time but we were approached by a lady staff who was apologetic as acknowledge our reservation. We were served a round of drinks. We were finally seated after about an hour!!! The long wait pays off as we were definitely not disappointed at all with the food presentation and the quality. Well done chef!! Service staff Siti was nice. To our surprise the captain also came over to our table with a bottle of champagne and apologize for the waiting time. Service recovery were Excellent!! We had a wonderful evening even though the waiting time could be shorten... We will definitely come back during non festive period!!

I would like to write that the food was amazing but I cannot. Garibaldi restaurant and its incompetent management ruined what was supposed to be a romantic Valentines treat.This restaurant had two sittings for dinner, one at 6.30pm and the next at 8.30pm, we choose the latter and arrived on time. The scene that greeted us was absolute chaos, with lovers on their valentine night out waiting in the street for their table. Nobody seemed to be in charge or registering the diners as they arrived. After waiting for 30 minutes outside we decided to push our way past the crowd of frustrated couples waiting and find a small spot at the bar for at least a little refreshment. We eventually where able to collar a waitress and gave our names and explained that we have been waiting then over 45 minutes for our reserved table.After waiting I whole hour I went into the main body of the restaurant and asked for the manager, I was pointed in his direction but when I complained about the length of time we had been waiting he just ignored me.At last 1 hour and 20 minutes after arriving exactly on time for our 8.30 reservation, at 9.50pm we were shown to our table, only to be greeted by the debris of the previous occupants and a rapid clean up by staff around us. At this scene my husband had had enough, he complained directly to the manager only to be told by this arrogant , rude man to leave his restaurant..To be fair the girl at the bar tried to do her best to help us and even in our distress of being treated so badly by the manager, asked us if we would like her to order a taxi.I have a few tips for the management of Garibaldi restaurant, having dined out extensively around the world.Courtesy to customers is of the upmost importance, everybody understands if there is a delay, but it is nice to be told and apologised to..it just shows that you are considered and would like to retain the clients patronage.To offer a drink to your customers while they wait and maybe a sample of something from your kitchen if the waiting period is longer than 20 minutes.and the most important thing and what I have discovered during my working life, one satisfied customer will tell one person, one dis satisfied customer will tell ten

excellent Italian food in a pleasant environment - queues out of the door with people trying to get a late table on valentines day - shows the popularity of the restaurant. Indulged in some very expensive and wonderful Italian wines. Met the chef and the owner - nice touch seeing how busy they were
3
The menu variety was good but did not live up to the descriptions, the food was average for all of our dishes and small in quantity for the prices charged.Starter salads were simple and well done but not anything special.Main course of suckling pig was 3 forkfuls accompanied by 2 small scoops of potato purÃ©e and 1 asparagus spear cut up and positioned around the plate. Pretentious old style "nouvelle cuisine " that I thought had long past.Spaghetti Mare had a 3 prawns and a couple of pieces of squid and 2 clams with a unimpressive sauce and hardly generous in content.The wine list caters for people who have more money than sense.A good restaurant should have at least a reasonable House Wine this did not and is the worse for it.I and or my companions certainly would not return and I would advise others not to - unless you like overpaying to impress
4
The service was exceptional. we informed the service staff that we need to rush off in 1 hour and he speeds up our orders without any compromise of the food quality. I love their main and dessert. A little too pricey though
5
Excellent food and very nice presentation!😊 the staffs siti, kamsami, raj and especially the Manager are all very hospitable. Thank you so much for a wonderful experience!😊 will surely recommend this restaurant😊

I visited Garibaldi in July 2013 after arriving from a flight from Australia, and so a great quality pasta dish was greatly prized after several hours of enforced starvation to avoid the horrors of airline food.And I was not to be disappointed – after checking Trip Advisor, I selected Garibaldi, and was thoroughly impressed. Certainly not for the budget-conscious diner, it is the kind of place you will only enjoy if you let go of your purse-strings and just enjoy the experience. I had a Spaghetti Bolognaise with a serve of herb bread, and a fresh watermelon juice, which was fantastic. The service, and the experience were equally as brilliant, and I thought the whole experience was so great, I barely noticed that I had spent in the vicinity of $65sg. The main was not exactly massive, so I was glad I ordered a side dish.That is what excellence in dining is about – if you walk out thinking you’ve not got your money’s worth, it fails the price versus quality ratio. At Garibaldi, I knew walking out that the quality of service & meal matched the price tag.The odd thing about Garibaldi is the location – tucked into relatively-quiet Purvis St, it is so innocuous that if I wasn’t specifically looking for it, I may have walked straight past it. I had walked from the Suntec City Mall, and got there in about five minutes, and Garibaldi is located within a geographical triangle of MRT stations that includes the Bugis, Bras Basah, and City Hall stations. The building is one of magnificent old shopfronts with a covered walkway that are dotted all around central Singapore
5
At several occasions we had dinner there. Restaurant has 3 small room sections, so still intimate feel.\Service is efficient and helpful.They have a menu with all-italian dishes plus a seasonal menu based on freshness.Everything is very fresh, cooked to perfection/ and of wonderful taste.Sometimes even better than in Italy- as in Italy usually they serve only dishes from the specific region.Fish is always very good and so are the pasta dishes. One is linguine with spannercrab, wodka sauce and tomato sauce. just excellent.Extensive winelist, very good wines- at high cost- SE-Asia applies everywhere high duties on imported alcohol.We were always highly pleased with the evenings out in this restaurant
4
I've been to this restaurant a few times and it is a bit expensive for what you get; however, it is a good choice for a Sunday brunch, as it provide a number of small portions with an alcohol option. If you have friends and family coming to visit Singapore, the Fullerton, Regis or other hotel Sunday brunch may be more appropriate; however, if you are a local and want a nice and robust brunch, I would recommend Garibaldi
3
My husband and I used to enjoy the food in Garibaldi for its set lunches. Our last trip was a little disappointing as we had to top up $10 for a dessert that was not part of their set lunch. In the past, the maître D would wheel out a cart consisting a variety of desserts, much to our delight.
4
We have visited this restaurant during restaurant week. The food on this restaurant was beyond my expectation and the service was very professional, as it was my bday the served a free extra cake and sang for me. The reason why I give this place only 4 stars is the cold interior of the restaurant the high price
2
I travelled a lot and I really appreciate great food, wine and good company with friends. My experience at this restaurant was no pleasant at all. When we got the bill, we had the sensation that we've been really stolen for the prices charged. Two people at the table ordered the white truffles over the noodles. The waiter comes at the table with a scale and he starts to shave the truffles over your pasta. In any moment it was mentioned anything about the price. They should of, because they charged us for the truffles, a "fortune" . If this is the case, we should have expected a much better service in a restaurant that you are going to spend 250SG per head. The service was very bad and poor. The waiter barely spoke English
2
Bad service .but they can not bring the dishes without clearing away the table..unforgivable mistakes.average food
5
I have always enjoyed the food, the service and ambiance of this restaurant. I usually end up here for business or special occasions with my family. I've held little surprise parties and even proposed to my wife here. I don't think any other restaurants would bend over backwards to even help organize a surprise party, much less be a part of it.That said, the food is superb and has never let me down or given me an excuse to fault it
3
Place comfort, you cannt use sandal, short pants or T-Shirt for the dinner, price i Think more expensive for the food. any other italian restaurant near more cheaper.
4
When I step in the restaurant the waitress warm smile and warm greeting. I order a corn soup the soup is nice, the spaghetti I can taste is handmade the taste is different from other. The atmosphere make me feel relax. Will visit again.
5
Good food
Nice ambiance
great hospitality.
Pricey
Had tuna steak, poach egg with cheese fondue.. Home made pasta... Only one word to decribe their food...yummy.
4
Garibaldi was a good choice for a large business party dinner. Food was excellent and served fast. Service was impeccable starting with the elegant welcoming, super quick first drink accompanied with olives and cheese, and continuing throughout until dessert and coffee. Even taxi was ordered efficiently. Zero complaints, only mille grazzie! Hope you stay in business
4
I visit Garibaldi on almost every visit I make to Singapore, and have never once been disappointed by the service and food. The main riding room is subdued and quiet. On this visit, I asked about a favorite appetizer I had on occasions which sadly is no longer on the main menu. My server coached the chef to prepare it for me, a returning customer. What a pleasure to taste my lobster salad one more time, freshly made to satisfy a long time foodie. Service as always is above reproach. Prices tend to be on the high side
4
Picked this restaurant to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary while overnight in Singapore on 15th September. Looked small from outside but once in there are several rooms. Quiet the night we were there but not empty. Staff very attentive without being over zealous. Had wonderful beef carpaccio for starter followed by lamb and venison. Small portions but beautifully cooked and served. The freshly made focaccia was a highlight and they kept bringing us more. I had opened some cards and had them on the table and we were given a piece of chocolate cake with a Happy Anniversary label which we really appreciated. The wine was quite expensive and the overall meal was more than we would normally pay but it was worth it for our special occasion
5
I visited Garibaldi on recommendation from our hotel concierge. A very modern decor combined with classical Italian dishes. The service was impeccable and the food stunning. From the fresh oysters to the slow roasted lamb and the chocolate souffle cake. This restaurant is not particularly child friendly, no pizzas here! The waiting staff are knowledgeable and helpful and not at all pushy. We had a great evening with meal and a few drinks coming to 450 Singapore dollars. So not cheap but in this instance you definitely get what you pay for. Would go back again and again.
4
The restaurant looked very quiet from the outside, we almost changed our mind to go somewhere else. But once inside, tables almost full. Food & wine were really good. Friendly and attentive staffs. I was not particularly fond of wall decoration but overall ambience was good. Very wide selections of good wine though pricey. Overall, worth a 2nd visit
3
I think I have been spoiled but I went to this restaurant with great expectations and everything was so-so in the end. The mood at the restaurant was a bit low energy and the waiter/sommelier had a bit of attitude. The food was not spectacular and the bill was up there for the meal. Bit of a shame. Loads of options in the menu so maybe will try again on a busier night and will give it another chance.
4
I was recommended by my hotel to dine at this place, it was my sisters birthday and I wanted to take her somewhere nice.The location is not in a fancy place but don’t bother about that it’s the food what you want..The atmosphere from inside is kind of good.They do have a bar which is viewing the street.The food is beautiful and fantastic taste loved it and even my family, the restaurant waiters and the manager was very welcoming and sweet.You should try this plac
4
Fast response to the reservation + excellent service and food.
Nice place to celebrate special occasion. Quite expensive but worth it.
3
Was there on CNY for lunch. Had veal ravioli pasta with porcini mushroom and cream sauce, thought they did quite well for this dish. Husband ordered basic pasta al pomodoro to check their tomato base standard. He thinks that they are so-so. do-able standard only!
4
Was there during Restaurant Week and had a splendid time. They serve you little margarita shooters while they set your table and dazzla with good service. Be prepared to pay a significant price, but the food is quite good overall, although they didn't cook my pasta al dente. Other than that, the rest of the dinner was amazing. Read my blog for the full details!http://sethlui.com/food-review-garibaldi-italian-restaurant/

We've been going to Garibaldi for several years and love it. The food is always excellent and it's the very best service of any restaurant in Singapore. Always one of our top picks when we want to go out for a great meal. They also have an extensive wine selection, including what is probably the largest selection of Gaja in Singapore. In addition to the regular menu, they usually have a chef's tasting menu and a special menu based on what is currently fresh. For lunch, they also have set menus to choose from. The restaurant is also very accommodating with special requests. If you want to share a dish, adjust the portion size, substitute something you can't eat, none of this is a problem. Everything is good so I hate to recommend particular dishes over others, but I am partial to their tagliatelle with duck ragout and the Milanese is a house favorite. I can't wait till my next meal there
4
Had dinner on a Monday evening so the atmosphere was not the best due to lack of customers, however the food was excellent, the wine flowed and was of good quality and the staff were very professional if just a little on the stuffy side. I had the mushroom risotto for my main course, and it was average at best, didn't really have the wow factor for the price
4
I went here with a group of 6 for a work function.We booked a private room and had agreed a set menu up front, with some limited choices.We had some good drinks before the dinner and were ushered into the room on time. It was arranged very nicely for us.Our orders were taken and the drinks arrived fast, followed by the food shortly after.We started with tuna tartar, then crab pasta, lamb or fish and finished with chocolate tarts.All the food was good, well cooked and tasty. The service was friendly, efficient and we never waited for anything.We had a good night. Nothing amazing or very special but a good night out, with the restaurant looking after us well
4
Good, quiet and elegant ambiance, efficient work staff, decent diners with no noisy, unruly behavior are just the peripherals of this gem of a resto in the middle of Purvis St. The biggest reason to come back is the food. Good selection, but as it was lunch on a weekday, we opted for the set lunch. Mine was the mushroom with mozzarella for appetizer, tuna/olives/capers pasta for my mains, and the chocolate lava cake with strawberries on the side for dessert. The meal was simply amazing in its simplicity but in its tastiness... everything was just right...nothing too salty, too sweet, just perfecto. Would definitely come back for more, prices of the a la carte meals are not bad. I wouldn't take time to write if Garibaldi is not worth endorsing. Looking forward to the next visit
5
Had an excellent meal here. Everything was really good and my 4 colleagues' food also looked excellent, and they said it was great as well.I had angels hair with oysters & caviar (superb) and then sea bass (perfect), and zablagione (one of the best I've ever had). Wines also very good and cocktails top class also.Overall a faultless, superb meal
3
I was there with four friends. The wine was flowing and we had a good time.I think the food was ok and the service had to be chased.My dish, the lobster pasta was the best pick and quite nice.This is NOT a fantastic restaurant.Parking is an issue here. You have the option of leaving your car at the Raffles hotel and walk the one street over

Valentines day, 2013. My wife and I decided to take a couple friend of ours to dinner. We made reservations at Garibaldi, based a lot on some of the reviews on this site.I have to say, the dinner was an unmitigated DISASTER.We had an 8 PM reservation, but when i called them earlier in the day, i was asked to come at 8.45 pm. So we reached by 8.50 pm. No table. we were asked to wait at the bar, and order drinks. No probe, we did that. No drinks for half an hour. Reason: The girl at the bar could not reach for my whiskey that was on the top shelf. My friend picked up the bottle and gave it to her, and he brought us water, wine and my whiskey. We did not tip our friend yet!!The table was ready at 10 pm, and guess what? there was a dirty table mat on my chair!The food took really long to serve, the orders were confused with orders from other tables, the bill was incorrect (overcharged of course), the service was disgusting, the staff could not care less. Other diners had the same problems. The food, when it came, was exquisite, but the rest of the experience left a very bad taste in our mouths.My recommendation: NEVER ever go there!PS: If anyone knows how i can assert my rights, please let me know. I can't believe that Garibaldi can get away with this, and i have to pay for my poor choice
4
Very good Italian food with good service. The night we were there it was very busy and the staff seemed a bit overstretched. That said they did their best and we were quite happy overall. Definitely book a table in advance.
5
Surprisingly Good..an italian Restaurant In Singapore. Wine was superb.. all the pasta dishes to die for and the sweets ..aahhh..Sinful!! Love it! Nice service too. For me same feeling like eating In Italy.. Complimenti!!
5
Fine dining with fabulous fresh and delicious Italian in Singapore, it is tucked away in Purvis Street just off Ocean Road. Quiet and elegant. Very nice bar area to have a cocktail prior to dinner.
5
Whether it's for a pasta or a risotto or a "full all out" dining experience, Garibaldi is the perfect place. The chef/owner is Italian and maintains a quality of ingredients and preparation that one would expect from an Italian chef. It's hard to find fault with a restaurant that offers such a wide choice of dishes with a wine list to match. Although children are accepted, I wouldn't suggest this as a place to bring them to dinner. Garibaldi is a grown up restaurant for people with discerning tastes. Definitely worth a visit for Italian food if you're in Singapore and miss a taste of Italy. Look no further. Bravissim
4
Stayed twice in this restaurant during my last trip to Singapore.The chef in this place is italian; this represent a guarantee of the quality of the food.Tried mainly pasta selection and, I must say, that all was very good.All the meals was accompanied by a very tasty, original "focaccia" with an excellent italian olive oil.Service was made with care and kindness.Price was high but within "Singapore's standard"..
4
Worthwhile dining experience. There were two menus on offer, the chefs signature menu and the regular menu. Had the Hokkaido scallops for starters and the tagliatelle with guinea fowl for mains. Both dishes were well presented and had a very clean taste. The pasta was in a cream sauce, which I never usually order, but I was very glad with the result specifically a creamy taste but very gentle on the palate.We were served a refreshing passion fruit liqueur at the very start. For dessert I indulged in a sabayone with pistachio gelato which again was very well presented and divine. Serving sizes were adequate.While the service was attentive, the attempts of the wine waiter to get the pricier wines rather than suggest wines more agreeable to what we ordered was a bit disappointing.Would certainly return
4
My wife and I had lunch at Garibaldi during Singapore's Restaurant Week. My expectations of Restaurant Week menus weren't as high as, say, ordering from the a la carte menu. But the restaurant did a good job of it - delicious octopus salad appetiser, followed by a cray pasta main, and completed with an Italian take on apple pie. The restaurant decor was pleasant with dark wood giving it a slightly sophisticated interior. And service was attentive but discreet. I'd certainly consider a repeat visit although it should probably be for dinner next time
5
Purvis Street, behind Raffles Hotel is no longer the center of activity it once was before Marina Bay Sands opened. This means you can actually get a table at Garibaldi, enjoy a fabulous Italian meal and have a conversation without having to yell. The backround music is Italian and the food exactly what one would eat at a very good restaurant in Italy. Chef/owner Roberto Galetti always has the freshest of seasonal produce and the regular menu or set meal are always appealing. His specials really are special as they are what is best at the market that day and therefore change often. The prices are well within the norm for a restaurant of this level and when I want Italian food this is where I come. Roberto will make special dishes if he has the ingredients even if the dish isn't on the menu. This isn't a place to come for a pizza with screaming children, but rather a sofisticated but not snobby venue for a great meal accompanied by a great bottle of wine. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for a romantic dinner, a business lunch or dinner or just a "let's have Italian food tonight" place
4
In my recent trip to Singapore, I went to Garibaldi's to have some food with colleagues and we ordered a wide range of food. what I really liked about the place was the ambience.the food was good too, I wont say it was the best Italian I have had, but it was decent enough.the wine selection there is pretty good too.so if you want to head to a place for a quite and nice meal with a great wine selection and money is not an issue I would definitely recommend Garibald
5
If you are looking for an original Italian wine&food tasting then this restaurant is absolutely what you need!After many many days of lovely Indonesian food we really needed the taste of our Italian food and after a quick research we ended it up at Garibaldi:Italian music,Italian wines,Italian sparkling water and a Great Unique Italian Chef:Roberto Galetti.We introduced to him and he welcomed us with is nice Blue eyes and a genuine big smile!He took care of us all the time and made me wonderful seafood spaghetti!Mozzarella tasted exactly like home and he told me that every day it is delivered from Caserta!!!OMG this is amazing!The whole meal was a great experience and Roberto now is a good friend to us.GRAZIE Roberto we love you long time
5
Flawless service, excellent food. Although is a little bit pricy, it definitely worth it with the quality of service and food. Garibaldi is always on the top of my list for any specia occasion.
5
An excellent experience. The food is fantastic, and the wine list is very unique (for the real connoisseur), although expensive. The staff is very attentive and friendly, and the tiramisu is a specialty there for dessert.
5
Very good italian food , spectacular wine list , excellent service , good location , within walking distance of the Raffles . One of the top best italian restaurants in Singapore .
4
Good food and a nice date place with good service. Not the best value. Make reservations.
4
This is a well known Singapore restaurant. Food standards are usually quite good. HOwever prices are at the high. Set lunches at 39++ are also at the high end. Other similar quality restaurants can do lunch at about 29++ which is better value.However if you want to impress guests and if you are on a corporate spending account - this is a great choice
3
Coming from Melbourne which has amazing Italian restaurants this review may be from a harsher critic. I found the food an service good but not exception or different. It was a nice quiet and romantic venue and a pleasant night but not one I'd hurry back t
5
The restaurant is round the orner from the hotel where we stayed(Naumi Hotel). The choice of food was magnificat !!! It was extremely well presented and tasted amazing. The wine list was a book with circa 40 pages, we were helped with choosing the wine which was nice. A really pleasant experience was when Roberto the owner and head chef came out a spoke to us as he did with a few other guests as well. I was so impressed with the wine decanters I decided to buy one. They have a great selection of decanters to buy if interested.
4
My daughter and I ate here for a special evening while in Singapore for just one evening. It was recommended by my hotel concierge. All of the food was outstanding. In particular, my pumpkin marscapone soup was very memorable. We both had a special pasta dish and we were very impressed. The prices were high, but not outlandish. We paid about $120 SG for a meal, although we only had soft drinks, not wine.Half way through the meal, the restaurant started to fill and we were assigned a new waiter. The transition was a very bad one and the service was really quite a shipwreck from that point on. It took us about 20 minutes to get our bill and at one point we walked up to the front desk to ask for it. Crazy
5
My date and I enjoyed the food here on valentines day. We had dinner and the food are served by real Italian staff. They have quite a range of wine selections and it will be served to you chilled. The ambiance is ok, with slightly dim lights making the atmosphere more comfortable. Its tucked away from the busy street. I would definitely go back here again
3
We were a big group, but this was a very disappointing evening. Most of us were quite tired through work and jet lag and needed some assertive service to get drinks and food in front of us, but what we got was long delays and frustration.It took over half an hour to get served a drink. One of us took control and ordered a spread of anti pasta whilst everyone chose their main dishes. The antipasti was great but was served while we were still waiting to'place our main orders and so we were left to juggle large menu books and little plates of antipasti. And of course the orders had still to go into the kitchen....I am sure the food was good, but we were past enjoying it by the time it got to us. We passed on desert and coffee and left. Probably not fair to either them or us, but then, that's the test of a restaurant - to size up what your customers really need and take control to provide it. Pour us some drinks. Suggest some antipasti to get us going and then get the orders in. Probably wouldn't go back
5
this is one of the finest italian food that i liked the most. I am the prince of food, so go and eat at the best places in singapore. if you don't like this, i will treat you 1-for-1 anytime.
5
Amazing Italian food, great service. Not the cheapest, but prefect for a special night out. Home made pasta to perfection. Tip, wear pants, no shorts.
5
This is the best Italian food in Singapore. When we travel through here on business we will always eat here our first night. Clarke Quay is enjoyable and the food here at Giribaldi is fresh and prepared by a talented chef. The risotto is out of this world
5
This restaurant for many years dominated the Italian restaurant scene in Singapore,after visite several times during different years i understand why.Consistence,high quality ingredients,professional service,extensive wine list,nice designer and atmosphere.Try 7 course set menu with wine pairing ,is excellent match also with extra verge italian olive oil each dishes is delicious ,manager and chef greeting each table with short chat and explanation of each dishes ,the night is busy like usual and we have very nice time ,thank you at all staff of Garibaldi

We loved the restaurant as the food was superb. Yes it is pricey but then so is Singapore. The wine list is extensive but we did not take a glass or bottle sticking to no alcoholic cocktails insteadMake sure you make a booking first, we did and there was no hassles. The menu is varied and has something for everyone and the prices are clearly marked (well for us there were)We has starter, main and dessert as we were hungry. Cost with tax, and soft drinks as well as virgin mojitos was S$340. Not cheap so be warned especially as there are plenty of alternatives.However, my partner and I enjoyed the meal and wandered to Raffles after.....
1
I have been going to Garibaldi since it opened. A special occasion restaurant. I have seen over the past 8 years the size of the restaurant expand, the food quality fall, and the prices rise. It really is not value for money. My final meal at Garibaldi is a case in point. After arriving punctually at 8:30 for my reservation we were asked to wait outside. After indicating we would prefer to be seated we were told that 8:30 was the "second session" and consequently we would need to wait for a table to become available. At about 9:15 we were at least invited to sit in the air conditioned bar. We were finally seated at 9;40 for our 8:30 booking. The last straw was the bistecca special. Ravenous, I made the mistake of not enquiring after the price. $90. There is so much better quality and value available in Singapor
5
Garibaldi has lived up to its reputation as a fine dining establishment. Service was excellent. We felt that we were very well taken care of. We tried both mains available for Restaurant Week. The squid ink pasta started off as a little fishy for me, but the aftertaste was very tasty and I enjoyed the dish very much. My partner had the braised veal cheek and it was absolutely heavenly. The meat was very soft and literally melted in your mouth. The bread served was very tasty as well. Overall we had a very enjoyable time and felt very pampered throughout the meal. Perhaps one area that Garibaldi can look to improve is the quality of coffee as it was burnt. But that has not affected the overall experience. We would definitely re-visit
3
It is always important to caveat your reviews based on the prices you've paid, so let me state at the outset that our meal was S$40++ so it's on this basis that I write the following review. Appetizer: prawn salad with beetroot- No complains. The prawn was fresh, crunchy and the salad extremely flavourfulMain Course: Seabass- This was a little disappointing .. seemed like they just stuck the fish in the oven and that was that. - My girlfriend had some pasta which was also alright.Dessert: tiramisu- lots of icicles in the centre. Service was good and the servers were very attentive. Atmosphere was nice too. Overall, I think they could do better with the food
5
rare to find a combination of both in Singapore. The room lacks a little warmth, but made up in spades by the strong wait staff. Well informed about the produce and very helpful. Burratina was delicious as was the veal chop. Veal milanese here is also a must try.
2
I had discovered Garibaldi through the set menu of a business lunch and had liked it. Unfortunately, the dinner experience delivered far below expectations. Since we are great fans of Italian cuisine, we ordered typical Italian appetizers followed by pasta dishes. The service, the food and the wine were at the acceptable level of an average pizza joint. The only problem is that the final bill came close to 400 SGD for pasta dishes that were not better than what we fix ourselves at home. For this price level, LP Tetsu, Kudeta, and the Basilico brunch offer incomparably more refined food and service. The nervous, busy and pushy maitre d' (or sommelier or both) does not help. Definitely not going back
5
They have nice wines there and the italian food is good. Its a nice place for a casual meeting and gathering as well.
4
Alwys dependable Singaporean Italian stalwart. Best veal milanese in town. Great for business or for romance.
3
The food was above average but everything from house wine to starters was expensive despite the fact that the restaurant is houses in a shophouse and very close to good and much cheaper eating places
2
It was my first visit in Garibaldi: the service is great and the food is overpriced. I had better and cheapest food in Dalucca Restaurant last week.......
5
Looking for a good italian restaurant in Singpaore not an easy task, but Executive Chef Roberto is doing an amazing job, elegant and modern, the food was very tasty and well presented. What stood out was the service, from being welcomed at the bar for a campari and then go to the table, from suggesting menu to serving, the staff is just impeccable. Really, an experience that engages all the senses.A must for those who appreciate good Italian food
5
Our concierge of the Intercontinental hotel recommended the restaurants and we so walked to it. We were greeted and got a table. We also got some breads and olive oil with balsamicoWe ordered some a carpaccio, another simple dish, pasta arrabiata and a risotto. All were excellent ! Carpaccio woth truffle oil, risotto was good but the portion is bit to big and the pasta was also good.Service and value excellent

Not my usual Italian dining place but decided to give it a try since it is on restaurant week. I went on to order the prosecco while waiting for my fellow diners. When I was walking to my table I passed the cake trolley which is parked at the corridor not covered with anything. The traffic along the corridor was quite busy with patron and waiter staff walking back and forth. I was wondering if this is Garibaldi standard but one would hope there should be some kind of covering for the cakes to keep it from direct or indirect unintended contact from patron or the staff. On to the dining table, I was given the set menu. Since this is a surprise menu I did not know what is going to be on offer. For starters there is only scallop dish. I am allergic to scallops and asked if there is any alternative to it and the waiter immediately said that he can only offer me a spinach salad and nothing else. He did not even ask if I am allergic to something else. I was quite surprised and felt like the waiter just want to rush taking my order and get it over with. For a restaurant as Garibaldi who is deemed to be one of the top Italian dining places by public I would expect a more refined service. I ordered sparkling water with the meal since we still have our prosecco. The waiter did not put the bottle on our table instead it was put in one cooler together with the bottles from other tables. I sure hope the waiter remembers which bottle belongs to which table. The food was forgettable and the waiter did not explain what was in each of the dish. I am not impressed since I had a high expectation to start with. When we are finished with our dessert and having our tea, the waiter opened a new bottle of sparkling water without even asking if we want to have it and went on pouring it to our glasses. I thought it is a standard everywhere that the waiter will ask if you would like another bottle before proceeding to open a new one. All in all, I was very disappointed with the experience and would not recommend it to anyone

Spontaneously popped in as fancied Italian and what a find! Aperitif in the bar with a very friendly welcome which is always a good sign. Then around to the spaciously laid out dining area. They put the families in another area for the brunches which is a good set up and we'll definitely return with our friends and daughter for Sunday brunch. We could have spent all afternoon browsing the red wine list. We had the salad and goose liver for starters. The suckling pig for main was sensational with the blackberries and sweet potato creating a really stunning contrast of flavours. The cheese platter to finish was just the right portion and types of cheese. The espresso was the final BIG test. For us, the espresso can make or break an Italian and this one was........PERFECT! Bravisimo

I had been to Garibaldi a couple of years back and had liked it .I had been recommended to come here again on this trip.I found the food disapointing. We ordered a starter of ravioli with summer truffle shavings. The ravioli was fine and well presented but the truffle had no flavour. Not even a slight taste of the truffle taste I was expecting. I ordered the steak and though it was edible it was not as fresh warm as I would like it to be and the taste was was not full. my friend ordered the Osso bucco and I had a few bites from her, it was the one dish amongst the many that was quite good. So if you do get invited and have no choice of the restaurant then order the Osso bucco.I will not go back to this restaurant again

This is an upmarket restaurant located just a block from the Raffles Hotel in Singapore. Do yourself a favour and give the hotel restaurants a miss. Everything about our dining experience in Garibaldi's was just wonderful. The service, the food and the ambiance were all outstanding. Its not cheap but its worth it. We picked a wine that was out of stock but they have an amazing collection and the waiter was able to recommend a wine that he thought we would like which was also a similar price to the original one that we ordered. His recommendation was ideal and showed that he had an expert knowledge of what we would like without suggesting we spend way more than we wanted to. The food exceeded our expecations. We'll definately be back next time we are in Singapore

This is an excellent Italian restaurant, offering superb food, fine wines and attentive professional service, at a high price.
The decor is intimate and romantic.
Highly recommended for a special occasion.

This is one of the better Italian restaurants I have been too, the food is excellent, well presented and ample. The wine list is simply amazing with cellars full of rare vintages of both red and white Italian wines.. Aircon is freezing so take a jacket but you need that to enjoy a red! Not cheap but well worth the experience

Have eaten at Garibaldi's quite a few times over the past two years. It is always hard to know what it's going to be like. I've had some absolutely cracker meals there, the last one was a long way short of the mark, especially given they are one of the more expensive places in the area. Unfortunately my last two meals there have left me disappointed.I have rated it at average and I'd have to say that was the view of our group. The appetiser was indeed excellent, and very large, the main course was close to ordinary, and the deserts were good but not outstanding. So you cannot say we didnt give it a good try!Garibaldi's trades on its reputation, and its the reason we keep going back, but sometimes you get the feeling that not enough care is being put into the main part of the meal. We'll go back for sure, but perhaps with reduced expectations. If the prices were not at the higher end of the scale then there would be little to complain about, but there are many Italian places in Singapore that serve better food for less cost

This restaurant makes your proud of being Italian. The ambience is classy, with perfect lighting, sleek decor, a wine collection cellar and just a very poliched feel to it. The service is impeccable and very Italian and the fod is amazing, I had the seafood pasta, which was just perfect and rich in South East Asian seafood. All in all, this place is a treat
5
Amazing food, excellent fresh and imaginative cuisine, nice location and atmosphere, good service for a beautiful night!!!!Let you suggest by the chef about the pasta.... He is happy and helpful. I tasted risotto and linguine, my friend ravioli.... Every dishes very good!Go here, it's a great restaurant

Spent New year's eve at Garibaldi. The set menu was great. Service could have been more personal. The chef has the basics right here. For the price paid, Singapore has some great Italian restaurants that are as good and some even better. I would go back for the great pasta

My wife and I went here for her birthday. It is a relatively small place but the tables provide ample space for a quiet evening together. A great wine list, nice variety of food choices, and very good service. Unfortunately, my wife's main course did not come off well but the waiter immediately removed it from the table, offered to replace it with any choice and without asking removed it from our bill. She even provided dessert for free along with complementary wine. Every dish is not going to be great if you're in business long enough - sometimes, a great recovery is all you need...and Garibaldi certainly did that for us. We'll be back

One of my wife's favourite restaurants. Expensive but a nice place for special occasions and we have visited 2 or 3 times before...The evening started off well enough, we both chose the same tasting menu and a decent bottle of wine and enjoyed the starters... Then disaster struck.The waiter knocked over my just refilled wine glass sending the whole lot into my waist and lap... Some hastily proferred napkins to try and mop up didnt really work, as the wine had already soaked in, and a trip to the bathroom to try and use a warm air dryer to try and dry out was fruitless as they dont have them installed. On returning to the table, the tablecloth hadnt been changed, but a napkin simply laid on top of my place setting...Trying not to let my ruined evening also spoil my wifes celebration we continued with the rest of the meal, but the mood had been broken, and with a damp cloying shirt, smelling like a brewery and wine soaking up from the tablecloth into my elbows, it was not a pleasant experience. We had planned to continue our evening afterwards but had no choice but to get a taxi straight home.The final poke in the eye was when I got the bill, a full charge (over $350) with not even a $20 credit for the lost glass of the wine the waiter had poured over me from a triple digit bottle of wine. Not wanting to make a scene and further ruin my wife's evening I swallowed hard and left.They say its when things go wrong that you get to see the true service of an organisation and on that basis, avoid this place at all costs.

I was brought here by a friend for a birthday treat and it was awesome. The staff was friendly and helpful. The food was good and atmosphere was great. Had an awesome time. Truely an experience to remember. Looks quite posh, was not sure of the price since it was a treat

My family of 5 ate dinner in December 2010. Firstly, while the waiters were attentive, they were quite clueless. When a complementary hor'dourves was brought to the table, there was no explanation about what it was until the waiter was asked. When the waiter brought pepper, he served one but ignored the other four on the table ! A shock to us, To give him the benefit of doubt, we thought he did not meant it -- he was just forgetful. The waiter earlier recommended a whole salmon fish to be shared by two. When it came, it smelled very nice with the herbs, but it was completely tasteless because the chef forgot to add salt. The fish cost S$88++ which was expensive by US standards. The soup of the day, green asparagus, came in big portion but was also tasteless (the chef must have run out of salt that whole day). The seafood risotto was a complete disaster because it was not properly cooked: the grain was still raw ! Once you have uncooked risotto, never ask for another because they are going to microwave it ! So we ordered lobster linguine as replacement. It turned out to be pedestrain -- pasta you can cook at home on your own. We were so disappointed we did not stay on for dessert.The restaurant looked like it had a nice ambience, but realistically speaking, the tables were crammed next to each other. There were three separate couples seated on a row and they could just reach out to their neighbour without getting up. That means there was no privacy for them to be romantic. Perhaps the restaurant is better for bigger groups who have license to be rowdy (after all it's not quiet dining)

Very nice staff & good food, nice location - perfect, I really enjoyed!

One of my fave restaurant in Singapore. went here twice. Exquisite! I ordered caviar the first time, and the chef were so honest they couldnt deliver bec. of the quality. that is the service, very honest, they strive for good quality, not just revenue.

the food is quite good but the service was horrible.
the atmosphere is dark and cold.

but nothing special. Nice to sit out on the corner while dining so probably worth it if you get a good seat.

Garibaldi is one of our favourite restaurants in Singapore, only recently pipped by Absinthe.We have dined here on a number of occasions for Brunch, Christmas dinner and evening meals, as well as popping into the bar for a Spritz after a long day in the shops.The food is always excellently presented and expertly prepared, service is impeccable and the ambiance is relaxed.It’s fine Italian dining so don’t expect pizzas and carbonara but beef tartar, lots of seafood and great deserts.Highly recommended

The food is ok, but they try to be too fancy and chic. Qualitywise food is good but very expensive and the menu is in my opinion a bit too narrow. I had troubble finding something I wanted to eat. They have all the basics: italian starters, pasta, meats & poulty, but the combinations of meat and potatoes/rice/vegetables/polenta were strange. The dishes are very greasy with a lot of cream, oil and butter. The place is very expensive, but as the food quality is good and the servise is also very good I guess people are willing to pay the price.This is not my favorite italian and I think you can find more affordable ones with just as good food in Singapore

We went to Garibaldi's by default as the other good Italian restaurants were closed for the Chinese new Year. It was a pleasant change though. The service was good though it was never in the face. We let the waiter suggest choices for us and it turned out to be excellent. We had "Bufala" for antipasti which consisted of some fine buffalo milk cheese and fresh tomatoes. A lobster pasta and some crispy baked japanese fish for the main course and "Pannacotta" for the desert. Although the menu was pricey we felt it was worth the quality
5
Great food and excellent service (attentive yet not too much). Pasta very much like a true Italian. Yummy puddings. Wine list on the slightly pricey side, struggle to find anything correct side of 200 SGD, however had an excellent Borola. Best Italian i've had outside of Italy

i had sunday brunch at garibaldi and it was way awesome. the appetizers which included wagyu salmon etc literally blown me away. the main course was a trio set of tomato based pastas. for me, i am do not like having tomato based pasta and immediately when i told the waiter, he got the chef to specially prepare a creamy based one. the desserts werent as special but overall the experience was superb. two thumbs up for service

Business dinner with Italians.. so very predictable they took me to an Italian place. Very very fancy, it commenced with oysters and champange.. the menu was translated to me as well as the wine list; there is English in the menu but it was best to have the natives describe what I was about to eat!The service was perfect! We closed the place; they were taking tablecloths off the table whilst I was been entertained. They didnt once ask us to leave; or maybe they did and I couldnt tell cos they spoke to my table in Italian.I guess I had a very biased experience due to the company that accompanied me. All in all, it was a good one. I cant really comment on the price as I was being hosted

Classic Italian fine dining. Wines,food and service are excellent. The veal milanese is the size of a table for two so best shared :)

One of the better Italian restaurants in Singapore. Good atmostphere, good food and wine list. Prices a bit high though.

Refined food except for the cool, dry bread.

love this place for the ambience and consistently good italian fare and service.

I tried this restaurant as I am a fan of Italian food.I was happy with the service and the surroundings were first class, but the wine was over priced and the food was not authentic.I tried a fettuccini which was served undercooked and the sauce was similar to what you might get out of a can.So it is a great place to impress your friends with a very expensive meal but order a steak
5
Tried the Menu Degustazione with margarita sorbet as an aperitif. Liked the margarita (well, more of the sorbet), scallop gratin, and breaded lamb chop with ricotta cheese. Forget the spinach noodles with duck. Reminded me of kaldereta with pasta. Love, love, and did I mention LOVE the desserts. Waiter was so generous that he offered us 2 desserts -- mixed berries with marsala wine sabayon and pistachio gelato then molten lava chocolate cake with hazelnut gelato. We also received complimentary amuse-bouche and at the end of the meal dark chocolates. Expensive but definitely worth every dollar! Cozy. Servers were very attentive and friendly. Definitely coming back when my wallet has recovered

OK only, not a bad place if someone else is paying

Great service!

I was amazed having for dinner the best burrata I ever had, this means it is flown in daily from Italy !!
Great atmosphere, enriched by my friend Brian... we aslo had risotto al tartufo, delicious...

Fancy Italian; fancy prices. Surprisingly, it's one of several upscale Italian spots in Singapore.

Great Food & Great Service!

Comfort italian, white asparagus, will keep going back...

Just let the chef do his own thing...leave the menu alone.

Good place for lunch.

Excellent and quality Italian food. If you want fine dinning Italian style, this is what I would recommend. If you are craving for dessert, boy oh boy ..you are gonna lvoe this place to death! Awsome dessert and some dessert you actually have to order 1 day or more in advance

Defined by most, the best Italian restaurant in SIngapore. It is probably true but lately has shown some inconstencies. Perhaps the chef Galletti has spread too thin having been busy to open many other outlets around the island. Better ensure he is manning the stove, the night you decide to take your belle (or beau) for an impressive evening
