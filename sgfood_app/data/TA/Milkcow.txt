Nice soft serve ice cream from korea and my favorite will be the hotseller milky peace with a sprinkle of pistachios, sunflower seeds and cashew clusters as well as the classic oreolicious cookies and cream. Nice indulgence on a hot day!

Love Milkcow soft serve Icecream. Smooth and tasty. You must try their latest addition Milky Churros (only available at The Cathay Milkcow branch). Their Baked Churros go very well with their soft serve :)

Texture and presentation were very good, taste wonderful. Lots of variant with combination. I bought the mint one. It's somewhat sweet, sour, minty and a bit salty which is quite a sensation for the tongue.

I've come by here for dessert a few times and have always been satisfied with the texture and taste of the ice cream here. I like the milky choco spuds version because it's a good combination of sweet, salty and crunchy! Price is reasonable for the quality

Compared to the immensely popular Honey Creme, I felt that Milkcow's soft serve won in terms of richness, smoothness and taste. The soft serve has a rich milk taste and is velvety smooth, and not overly sweet :) I recommend the classic Milky Honey, which is their signature soft serve drizzled with liquid honey. The Milky Cube (soft serve with a cube of honey comb) is photogenic but I'm not too keen on chewing on the honey comb. It tastes like bits of plastic after the honey is gone. But that could just be due to preference

Waffles are top class, only losing 1 star because I was hoping for a chocolate milkshake but didn't see any on the menu. Great food though! My son ordered ice-cream but as soon as he tasted it he didn't like it,that's another reason for losing a star. At least I got to eat it, yummy

I went to this yesterday and order tea, ice cream with waffle. The waffle took about 10-15 mins to make as the staff informed me while I ordering. The waffle was crispy outside and very soft and fluffy inside. The taste was good not too sweet even topped with Honey and Chocolate. The organic Milk soft serve was yummy as usual.

This dessert place was supposed to be a fad that was brought in about a year ago. Many months later, it is still doing well, thanks to its unique and rich milky flavour which retaining a smooth velvety texture when melted. Not too bad for a random dessert after dinner when with a group of friends and the place is homely enough to chill out

This place has amazing soft serve ice cream. Seriously, the creamiest, milky-est, smoothest stuff I've ever had. They only serve one type of ice cream, but you can put tons of delicious toppings on it. My favorites so far are Milky honey or Milky Shot- their version of an affogato, a shot of espresso poured over the ice cream. I've also tried the caramel popcorn and the honeycomb, but in my opinion the plain honey is better (and just a little cheaper as well). The caramel popcorn was just 10-12 pieces of caramel popcorn placed under and over their ice cream - nothing special and I would not order again. The Macarons were also nothing special - but MAN! This ice cream!!! I can't say enough how good it is, you must try it yourself.This isn't the cheapest ice cream out there, but the additional dollar or two are well spent
