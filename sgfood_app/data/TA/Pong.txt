This is my favourite and best value ice cream I can find in Orchard, aside from the ice cream sandwich street stalls. 2.50 SGD for a scoop of ice cream, and 5.50 for two scoops in a coconut husk and three toppings.It's supposed to be vegan, but the ice cream turns out to be quite thick and dense, a pleasant texture to the tongue.Definitely a great addition to the orchard area - I hope this business does well and lasts a long time (but don't raise the prices if you become more popular!
