Located on the outerside of marina Bay Sands,this place is a must go for Lebanese food. Not too big place to eat,but food quality is very good.Only serving lebonese cuisine.
4
Tried their famous platter, which was great and portion was generous for 2 people. Location is excellent, spent some time here just to chill on a fine afternoon. Price is a bit expensive but again considering their location -rent is expensive, maybe that's why.
5
great place if your a vegetarian or just like oriental food at reasonable prices nearby marina bay sands

Friendly service in a super chill out place with healthy Mediterranean food! Wonderful experience! üëçüèªüëçüèª

They have a lovely sit out looking out to the river & bay, by a lotus pond, also a small air conditioned sitting .It's a vegetarian restaurant but they do serve eggs . The falafel & shamshuka are decent so are the sweet potato fries , but mind you the fires are a bit sweet
5
Located in front of the lotus pools and the big lotus building is this great middle eastern restaurant by the israeli indian chef reena pushkara.There is falafel and shawarma in the menu and good mualabia for dessert.Highly recommended even if not in the are
5
Been to this place lot many times, its kind of favorite.The pita here are really amazing. You get to choose all the fillings (just like subway), and there are lot of options to choose. There dressings are simply great.Paradise for vegetarians. Go for the platter and try out different fillings your own
5
After a visit to the Art Science Museum, my husband and I decided to stop here for dinner. We ordered the Meditteranean Platter, which had hummus, baba ganoush, grilled vegetables, tabouleh, an eggplant tomato dish, pita bread, rice, and falafel. Yum! Everything was tasty, and it was plenty for both of us - very filling. We sat outside and did some people watching, but there is seating inside too if that suits your style (and temperature preference) better. The platter cost 30 SGD and was certainly enough for two. The service was very nice, too - we would definitely return again to this place
5
Even if the staff is not friendly, welcoming and the service is poor, the food is really excellent and super fresh ! It was the best falafel ever !!! A good point : an excellent value ! I recommend it specially with kids who love all the sorts of wraps
2
We walked in here because everywhere else was packed and sadly we wished that we waited in line somewhere else. Service was quick yet prepared badly, the margarita pizza was extremely poor and something that could easily be done by a 6 year old. The salad bowls were average and the shakshuka was just a bowl of slodge. The food is overpriced for what it is, I paid $15.90 for my shakshuka. As we were eating they were playing extremely rude music, such as Starboy and Black Beatles. Both these songs contain EXTREMELY vulgar and racist language, due to this I would not recommend this place for families as the staff clearly like playing rude rap songs.I'm usually nice in my reviews but considering that this is in Marina Bay Sands, it clearly isn't up to par
5
We visited their Marina Bay Sands venue. The food was superb. They had good options for vegetarians. The Falafel and Shwarma were yummy. The ambiance was a little fast food like, which is the only thing that can be improved
4
I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of food on offer. And also fresh juice made as you watch was great
4
It's a great place to satisfy your mediterranean cravings right in the heart of singapore city. Beautiful place with beautiful people!
4
Great food! Good location. The Mediterranean plater was enough for 2 people and the margarita pizza was perfect for our 6 year old. Pita pan gives generous helpings for the price they charge.
3
We ate falafel at this restaurant. The falafel isnt very spicy. Its average tasting and quite bland. Make sure to add the spicy tahini sauce to make it taste a bit spicy. Chill sauce given out is sweet and chinese.. A can of coke is $4 and a full size falafel is between $11-15. You can sit outside and enjoy the views of the marina bridge and fullerton bay hotel across the marina.
4
Me and my husband are both pure vegetarian, and to find a veg food place can be quite difficult. Whilst checking out Pitta Pan menu, we gave it a try. The food was awesome! Great sized portions to keep you going for a few hours! The pitta full falafel pocket is one to try! You cannot go wrong with this place. It was clean and the staff were also friendly and value for money!
4
Was tired of the omnipresent east Asian fare and was thus drawn to Pita Pan on the last day of my visit to Singapore. Ordered the Green Shakshuka with eggs and french fries with spices..the person taking the order at the billing counter who was supposedly the manager had a poor attitude and had to be coaxed into taking the order. We waited a while and then the beeper indicated that the order was ready. When I went to pick it up, only the french fries were ready. The Shakshuka was there but did not have the eggs, so the manager whisked it away. Meanwhile the assistant told me that everything was ready. When I pointed to her the empty spot where the Shakshuka was (before the manager whisked it away), she looked at me with suspicion as I could have wolfed it down right in front of her...then she looked around as if looking for a missing item...then she suddenly found the dish sizzling on the stove itself and quickly put it in front of me...After this little adventure in collecting my dish, I sat down to eat and I did enjoy it partly also because it was a pleasant change from eating various east Asian meals involving meat and rice...So the moral us: You can visit Pita Pan if you need a change but can put up with poor service and bad attitude. Also probably the only place that served a vegetarian meal (egg optional in all the dishes
3
If you are in need of vegetarian food and are in the mall at Marina Bay Sands, well you may try their food. The food is just ok. It is too pricey but maybe because they need to cover rental. The service needs to be more efficient. The staff doesn't move fast enough. But overall, it is a not bad. Will go back for my vegetarian days
2
Ordered just the hummus. The pita was great but hummus was tasteless and nothing like the real thing as I remembered from my adventures in the middle east, salads looked tired and not very attractive.But the real disappointment was what they call olive oil.Not tasted like olive oil and not looked like one, It was tasteless, odorless cheap refined oil.Also tahini was awful.
5
Pita pan has great food, a great variety and speedy service. Staff were good and helpful and an asian man i think the manager was also walking around checking salads and making sure everything was okay. Was a great meal and not expensive unlike everywhere else so we left very satisfied
5
The best falafel,hummus and shakshuka in Singapore. Great option for vegetarians!
We will definitely come back.
5
These fast food Lebanese is in marina bay sands . Food taste is. Mouth watering and freshly made in front of you. It's an self service n little sitting but ideal for couples or small family.
3
If you have a vegetarian member in your group at MBS, this would be the place to go. Make sure you get one of the platters - can be finished by a single hungry big eater/group of 3
4
The Restaurant serves a wide range of vegetarian food complete with pita bread. Set meal for 2 is the best choice for first timer at the place.
4
Pita pan is the place to go to for a satisfying vegetarian meal if you are at the bay front area. I was quite surprised to discover a pure vegetarian restaurant in such a prime location. The felafels were delicious and I loved the spicy sauce. I did not order the platter, but shall on next visit as it looked pretty good
5
This is one of the best Meditteranean restaurants I've been to! The food is just sumptous! Order one Mezza platter and you'll be full for an entitre day!! Even the location is wonderful,in front of the Art Science Musuem and has the entire skyline visible.The location of Marina Bay is just bustling!Service and ambience lovely
5
Heard lots about this place. Was lucky enough to dine here. We reached almost at the closing time. The wraps are delicious and helpings are very big. One wrap is sufficient for a meal. A must go when in Singapore or visiting Marina Bay Sands.Has vegetarian options too
5
I absolutely love this place! Lovely location and the concept is so simple but awesome. This is one of those where a hard core meat lover like me agrees to eat vegetarian fare willingly. Their Mediterranean platter is sort of my favorite. Its an amazing combination of falafels, hummus sauce and garlic sauce along with salads, all of which you stuff inside a pita bread. Finger licking good. Healthy food can be tasty too, you see! Slightly pricey but worth the money. Their juices are very fresh and the Red shakshuka is flavorful too. A must must try if you happen to Marina bay sand
3
Great location for a healthy bite. The food variety and ability to customize makes this a unique place in Singapore. Food is cooked fresh in front if your eyes. Can get a bit crowded over weekend as sitting area is limited, but one can always go outside in the vast open page of MBS, bite & enjoy the views. Price - well this is Singapore, so don't flinch
3
Took the family in for an early dinner Sunday afternoon. Place was busy and a bit cramped - the rain meant no seats were available outside the doors.Ordering the food was a little confusing and we were expecting to pick our salads and fill the pockets by asking for our salad items ourselves. Seems here the fillings are done for you causing a big delay in our orders(child 1 likes pickles, child 2 doesn't , child doesn't like hummus, child 2 does - you get the picture).I would like to see the option - fill yourself or go the pre-filled.The staff were efficient and quick to complete the orders once the items were all locked in. One other item - turn down the music - we could not hear each other talk across the small tables.. Ambience is one thing, ear bleed is something else.
5
My husband and I tried this fantastic place for lunch today. We were so happy to find fresh, lightly prepared vegetables. It was a little piece of heaven for us.
3
So hard to find a vegetarian place to eat in Singapore, but here is one and in a touristy area!
The food is great but if you go in the evenings, it is always packed and their ordering/serving system is pathetic.
5
Have visited PitaPan multiple times with family. The service is quick, the portion sizes are great and the taste makes us keep coming back.
5
Great tasting Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern food. Quickly prepared to order, in a fast food format. Very filling and cheap! Stop by if you're in the Marina Bay Sands area
3
we waited 15 mins just to get served and then waited 20 mins for two pitas. the service is horrendous and this was mid week. the cost was far more than you would expect for the food and i wouldn't go again. the tables were left dirty most of the time
4
We eat at Pita Pan whenever we are in the vicinity. One is, its good wholesome food and its absolutely tasty and two, there is no fear of the famous fish sauce crawling into the food! The portions are good and the staff is really kind. The last we were there, after we had ordered, we had a change of mind and decided to take-away. The food was already plated, but the staff obliged us with a smile
4
Ate at Pita Pan on a few occasions during our recent visit. The vegetarian food is wholesome and in the main tasty. Portions are more than adequate (not over large) and it is 'order at counter' service. Our last meal was on Saturday night - it was crowded and I suspect they forgot my pizza as I had to remind the staff on several occasions. Two years ago they had a Pita Pan in Marina Square. This has closed - hopefully they will find another site nearer the square before we again visit Singapore
4
Pita Pan is your go-to fast food chain for vegetarians in Singapore.We had the 'half pocket meal','green shashuka'along with'couscous and soup'. The portions are generous and more than enough for a family of 3-4. Located just outside the shopping arcade of Marina Bay Sands hotel, it is a pleasant place to sit and enjoy a meal
4
Had the half pocket pita with the standard fillings. Quite filling and makes a great vegetarian meal by itself. Not cheap but then the price is justified just by the amazing view of the Singapore skyline. Had also ordered spicy fries which were extremely salty. The staff need to be trained more on handling customers orders and feedback. No suggestions of add-ons or sides, no reaction to the feedback on salty fries....Overall good experience if you stick to only the main cours
4
I've been here twice. I always opt for the Mediterranean platter ($30-32, depending on if you choose vegetable shawarma or falafel) which is big enough for about four people, and comes with hummus, vegetables, pita and other great vegetarian choices. I'd say Pita Pan is a very decent place to eat good food, but it's not cheap
3
The Mediterranean food was good but nothing great. The service was horrible and not customer-friendly.
4
Pita Pan is a regular whenever I'm at MBS. The food's great, though a bit on the pricey side, but the portions are pretty large and they're one of the best felfels I've had in Singapore.
4
been here a few times. The hummus and pita breads are always good. Tried the pizza last time and that was decent as well. Great veg option at TheShoppes mall.
5
If you are a pure vegetarian, wana eat something else besides daal roti.. this is the place to go. I love mediterranean food. Pita Pan was excellent. The falafel were fresh and hot. The pita was great. The vegetarian salad and sauces that came with it were great as well.They had a vegetarian platter and many other options. Must try if you are at marina bay and if you are a vegetarian. Its not super expensive either
4
Was hungry after strolling through the Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands and the Art Science museum when we discovered this quaint vegetarian outlet serving Mediterranean food like falafe,hummusl etc and pizzas and salad too. Though my kids preferred having the pizzas over the falafel. Pizzas were tasty but I felt the portions were inadequate and food a tad pricey. Service was good. Next time would love to try other varieties there
5
this restaurant was difficult to find.. its in one corner of the Shoppes at MBS in Singapore.. it was worth the pain of finding it and walking so far.. the view is amazing.. the food and staff is amazing.. we tried new Mediterranean dishes.. Female taking our order was very friendly and helped us place the best order for us.
2
Went in after a movie - was told that half the Resturaunt was reserved for the "boss" through a casual and callous manager. We were seated outside in the heat and one minute later the tables inside were released to anyone and everyone. I spoke to the Resturaunt supervisor expressed my displeasure and he got us a table inside. The attitude of the staff is HORRIBLE - the food is ok the wait for food is long. If you can wear blinkers and ignore them worth going once !!
5
We were a group of 6 and didn't realize they hadn't started serving lunch but the manager was kind enough to let us in and take orders from us. For that, we were really happy since all of us were famished! Now, that's the kind of service other restaurants should emulate. In terms of food, I tried the Shakshuka with 2 Eggs. That was mouthwatering! Definitely a nice place to have lunch but I'm guessing, it can be packed during lunch. However, in the dining area was a bit of a squeeze though. Overall, still a good place for meals
4
We were a group of 4 adults and 1 child and all of us enjoyed their platter which was quite sumptuous and huge quantity wise. The pita bread was really soft and fluffy. We tried veg shawarma which was also quite nice with creamy hummus and vegetables and my son wanted a pizza which came as two small pizzas also quite cheesy and nice.they have both inside seating as well as outside. Since it overlooks the Clarke quay , the view from outside is pretty if weather permits . I just felt it was slightly expensive and the prices could have just be a little more economical. But its a great place for flavors for vegetarian people in an otherwise meat and sea food dominated country
5
Loved the amazing Lebanese spread of falafels! The salads are very fresh and the array of toppings offered is super. Loved the fries too! Special mention to the fresh lime soda with mint leaves... Its a drink that we have tried to replicate many times at home. All in all a must eat when in Singapore or at the Marina Bay Sands
5
Pita Pan serves amazing vegetarian food, while you sit and admire the amazing Singapore skyline along Marina Bay Sand's Boardwalk. A must try is their hummus and falafels!!
2
The food was bland and the service was terrible. The size of the place is small and overly stacked as if anticipating patronage. Not gonna happen if the standards don't improve.
5
one of the best veg Mediterranean food in singapore.
hummus pita bread very excellent.
staff are very helpful..
3
Had to wait for 15 min to order and another 20 min for the order to be filled. Just 1 person in the counter for taking as well as fulfilling orders. Really poor service. So unlikely to visit again.
4
If you are after a decent vegetarian meal in Singapore, Pita Pan is definitely worth a visit. We found the service a little on the slow side, but the place was busy and it was nothing to get hot under the collar about. We shared 2 mixed platters amongst 2 adults and 2 kids and it was more than enough. The platters were generously filled with bread, dip, salads, felafel and vegie shawarma. Plenty of variety to keep everyone happy. Would recommend
4
I found finding veggie food in Singapore pretty tricky, but then one day I stumbled across Pita Pan. The prices are a lot steeper than some of the surrounding food markets but a lot cheaper than if you were to dine out in the Marina Bay Sands area. I chose a humous and falafel wrap which was filled with a salad and sauce of my choice. It was so tasty and very filling! Would recommend
4
I had tried Pita Pan at the Marina Bay outlet once in the past. I like the Pita bread. While visiting Marina Square mall on a Friday late evening, I came across this outlet of Pita Pan. It was good way for our family to feast on some Mediterranean food. We ordered the platter which has mix of humous, falafel, salads, tahini sauce. The quantity is good enough for two adults to fill their stomach. We ordered some extra pita breads for our two kids along with the big platter. The taste was good. All things were nicely cooked. Ee enjoyed our dinner very much. very fresh and
1
First off, the food is average. Nothing to write home about, but not bad. And in the context of the Sands, probably one of the more affordable restaurants (in terms of price).That's about the only good thing about this place. First, the layout is awful. If you take a seat on the right of the restaurant, you would have to place your order in the middle, go to your seat on the right, wait for their buzzer system to tell you it's ready, walk the entire length of the restaurant to collect your order from the serving counter on the left, and squeeze your way through patrons queuing for their order to make your way back to the seat. If it sounds complicated, that's because it is. And the restaurant is incredibly claustrophobic. Second, there is a sense of uncleanness in the place. Behind the counter closer to the bar, there are packages and other logistical items just stacked in the corner. Messy and unsightly. Not sure if cleaned. Next, the service. When we arrived, there were far too many tables that were not cleared. It seemed that only the cashier and another man was in the place. The man was asking the cashier how to construct the dish and she was herself swamped with taking orders and making coffee (the incredibly generic sort, don't buy.) Placed our order of a platter and fries. All the ingredients were already there so we felt that this was no fuss food. Yet somehow inexplicably we had to wait 35 mins for the platter to arrive. Another staff member came along and indolently assembled 2 parts of the dish, then walk off to do something else and asked yet another colleague to do it. He couldn't find half the things and kept rummaging around for the components. At this point, a tourist asked from the queue when she could expect to place her order because she had been waiting for 15 minutes. To which she got shouted down by what seems like the "manager" because, "can't you see I have no chef?" Yet despite the manpower crunch, there was no sense of urgency nor purpose - staff members were serenely busing plates back one at a time and nobody seemed to care about how the place was being run. After waiting 40 mins (the fries took another 5 mins) we rushed the food down in 15 and left. I will never return to this place.
5
We were so happy to find a great restaurant in a decent price in Singapore!The food was great, we had Hummus & Falafel and it was perfect.I Recommend coming here before / after the water show, it's a 3 minute walk (20:00, 21:30 every day
4
I come here once in a while for the salad bowl, where you are given a bowl and can fill it with as much veggies, hummus etc. from the salad bar as you like. The food is just alright and the rest of the meals seem a bit pricey, though. Nevertheless, worth it if you're in the area and are in a hurry
5
The service is great, and the food is excellent. I have not seen many place that provide food that is properly Middle Eastern authentic and real. The prices are a little expensive but is it not bad considering where it is located.
4
Nice place with access both from inside the mall and from the promenade.
Very kind service, and great Sabich and falafel.
4
This place is an awesome restaurants serving delicious Mediterranean cuisine with healthy snacks and drinks options. We searched from this place from trip Advisor only and it stood upto its image of a good restaurant tucked among a herd of Non Vegetarian restaurants all round. Its not even difficult to locate. This is a self service place.Staff is friendly and jolly and the best part is that you are served with Pita prepared right in front of you. We tried two dishes there: Veggie Pizza and Falafel Pita and both of them were superbly delicious. The quantity of food is good too. Over all we had wonderful time there and it actually served as our saviour there as we are vegetarians and its difficult to find a reasonably priced veggie restaurant in Singapore other than little India.Pita pan is such a wonderful place and a must visit for every one to relish different cuisine
2
My family and I were a bit tired from walking around and doing touristy things, so we'd decided to give this place a try because we saw they had pita pizza and local coffee. The coffee (which in my opinion wasn't anything special) arrived quickly enough, but the pizza took about 20 minutes and 3 follow-ups. It was tiny, and not very good. Wouldn't recommend because of the terrible service.
4
This restaurant is situated in a mall which is connecting Marina Bay with Gardens by the Bay. A must visit if you are looking for a healthy vegetarian. Their pita pocket is worth a try. Their cheese pizza was also good. So a place worth a visit..
4
We found this mediterranian cuisine joint quitely nested in Marina square...All veg....ecstatic.....!!!They had a scrumpcious array of fillings laid out for pita salads . Seemed absolutely fresh n nutricoius.We'd ordered Shakshuka: tomato based dish with two poached eggs on top served with pita bread..pleasant to eyes nd absolutely flavourful for palette..For our picky eater daughter (who actually picks out veggies from food) margherita pizza was ordered...what came were 2 regular sized pizzaz which was actually pita bread sliced from between n topped up with tomatoe based gravy n cheese...she loved the taste xcept for the tomato n paprika chunks which i had to press out from under the cheese..Spicy fries were also upto mark. For this we paid around 40sgd....Rest seemed okay..pizza though seemed a bit expensive..Portions : sufficient (we'd to get the food packed as quite a lot was left)Service : the staff were polite but speed slow as the lady who was taking order the counter was doing the pita salads n all herself...so she would finish taking the order n deliver the order n then take the next order. We had to wait around 15 mins to order though there were hardly 4-5 tables occupied. Maybe a person at the counter n another at the salad bar can solve the time management.Would like to mention, i did want to taste hummus n the counter lady did oblige me even though it was not along with my order.Ambience : open clean area, just sit-eat-go kindsPrice : little xpensive but worth it.Would advice all vegetarians n non-vegetarians to definitely visit the place n try out their wonderful mediterranian cuisine.We would head for their veg platter very soon..
3
Have been to pita pan a few times. At my last visit the hummus and baba ghanoush and in fact the whole Mezze platter was excellent. Unfortunately the shakshuka was very disappointing - the sauce was too sweet and the taste of tinned tomatoes was dominant. I hope this was a one off.
5
Why This Place Is Amazing: The falafel are excellent! There are so many toppings and sauces to choose from. You almost get confused. Just a fantastic falafel pita! Why It's Not So Amazing: Everytime I visit, it seems like there isn't enough staff... Tables don't get cleared. Also the meal takes quite a bit of time to prepare. But then again, good things come to people who wait. Overall a great place for falafel
4
One of the few small chain restaurants which I have tried in different cities (Macau n Singapore). Quality and taste is consistent. This restaurant has limited siting capacity and a weird layout making moving around a challenge. On Sunday night they had run out of many options so we ended up having normal falafal in pita bread and pizza. Pizza was loathing great but falafal were a treat. Look forward to try this place in another country too
5
Great food and service! There's a large buffet of fresh veggies where you can build your pita or salad as high as you like. So come hungry! There are lots of different options to choose from on the menu. The juice is made on the spot from fresh organic fruits and vegetables and served in a 16 oz cup. I asked to have mine blended with carrots and oranges and it tasted pretty good. The falafels are moist and far from dry! There's nothing bad I can say about this place. It was def worth the 7 mile walk!
2
only place in Singapore that serves pitas (to my knowledge), quality is decent. pretty convenient location, but we had to wait 30 min before getting served. SERIOUSLY people 35 mins to cook falafel is just ridiculous!
4
Wonderful, fresh falafel sandwiches. Service sometimes a little slow and/or subject to minor miscommunication, but if I'm near Marina Bay I always pop in and never regret it.
4
Popped in for a quick snack. Similar to a subway, but with pita and falafel. Absolutely delicious and reasonably priced.
3
Pita Pan is a small restaurant just outside the ArtScience Museum at Marin Bay Sands. Their ‚ÄúGreek salad‚Äù was fresh and good, but a Greek would hardly have recognized it as a Greek salad. But as said; fresh and good.
3
Been here already 2 times, more out of convenience (after visiting the lightshow at the Gardens and shopping in Marina Bay Sands) then for the nice atmosphere.Everything is self-service (so why pay service charges ??) and the food itself is expensive, especially given the self-service concept! Food is good though, I had pita menu with 5 falafels. Very filling! And you can choose you own veggies, sauces, ... there is no limit as long as it fits in the pita :). It comes with fries (very salty and the second time they were almost raw) and a drink, price +/- 20$. Some tables outside with a nice view over the water, so maybe that explains the price..
5
Pita Pan without question has the best quick serve Mediterranean food in town -- bar none. Their pitas are of the highest quality, and having eaten here over the course of the past year, their falafels have consistently got better. Vegetarian food that isn't fried, loaded with MSG, or just plain bland is very hard to come by in Singapore. Pita Pan is the complete antithesis of that, and a welcomed (and much needed) contributor to our local food scene. Granted it isn't "cheap" - but it is value for what you pay for. I look forward to visiting again shortly
4
I had read about Pita Pan in an online review and wanted to try it. It is one of the places offering vegetarian food from Mediterranean region. The place is located outside of the shopping mall next to the science museum. It is nice & cozy with 7-8 tables inside and few more in the open space. We ordered the mediterranean platter having Falafel, humous, peta bread, veg salad and couple of more items. The quantity was good for two people. The taste of all the items served was good. The falafel was cooked very nicely. Peta bread is one of my favorites when it comes to mediterranean good. The platter serves two peta breads. We ordered two more & shared it among 6 of us. The humous & the tahini sauce quantity was very good. It was a very satisfying food for us. Our friends were trying mediterranean food for the first time and they all liked it. I will definitely try the other options available on my next visit to Marina Bay. Highly recommended for people who want to try good healthy mediterranean food
4
Was looking for a quick snack before heading out for meeting and chanced upon this place. My first visit, no idea how the order works. The guy(Probably the manager coz that's what is printed on my receipt) at the counter tossed the menu booklet to me. Ermm ok. So i chose a non hassle one, half pita pocket. Wanted additional hummus however he said, its at the salad bar so he wasn't gonna charge me, but looking at the bill again, he actually did charged be additional $2. So then upon payment i asked for takeaway and he said, you should have told me first so i can waive off service charge, caught me off guard, quite lost for a moment! Anyways, just wanted to grab and go, so filled up the pita with free flow of toppings and was out. Enjoyed the flavours of the crispy falafels, 3 good-sized in half pita. Will b looking forward to come again to try other menu. If only they have more outlets
4
If you're a vegetarian and if you like healthy Mediterranean food, then this is the place to go. They have got some nice sandwiches sandwiches and platters. I love the Full pocket sandwich with a variety of salads which comes along, like falafels, baba ganoush, beans, carrots etc, and amazing sauces to tickle your tongue. Try the mango chutney - its lovely! Food is great and reasonably priced per the location but beers and other drinks are a bit expensive though and service is a bit slow as well. Wish they can bring down the beer prices and improve the service. Enjoy your food
3
Went there for lunch in weekday. Had one Falafal pita, it was quite filling. They put 5 Falafal in one sandwich along with excellent choice of many fillings and sauces. Food was fresh and tasty.Location is superb you can see Singapore skyline even sitting inside.Only downside was service. Manager and staff looked robotic and cold.Also I don't understand why they put 'Service Charge" when its self collect from counter when your order is ready. Prices are on higher side but considering the location it's justified
5
This was a brilliant place for some fast food. Lots of vegetables, lots of variety of vegetables and a great service. Fantastic for vegetarians. Good Price
5
Awesome food. The pita pockets and fries are great. The service is slow. and the people who take the orders are rude. BUt the seating and food is great and compensates for it. Great option for vegetarians. Only vegetarian restaurant
3
While the food was up to par at this establishment, I did not find the service to be so. Our server neglected to type in the proper orders. While one in our company ordered a meal, his receipt instead indicated that he did not order any. So, the server handed him someone else's fries. Those happened to be mine, but I did not know it at the time. The manager promised that my side order would be served shortly. However, that did not manage to make it down the string of command, or they simply decided that one order of fries was well enough, confusing as it might seem to the patrons. We were left confused about our orders and discontent with the service, despite the food. The pita meals were good, full of hearty falafel topped with your choice of many salads and vegetable toppings. However, it wasn't enough to make up for harried and questionable service
4
We have stopped here many times for their Hummus dips and fresh fruit drinks, as we walk around the Marina. This time we had their Mediterranean platter - a mixture of different Greek salad dishes and Falafel. We also had fresh carrot and apple drinks. We managed to sit outside, even though is was very hot and humid. Good value for money and the platter is definitely a share for two!
4
On the first day of our Singapore trip, while strolling around Marina Bay Sands Hotel - we wanted to catch a quick dinner. Since the majority of the gang was vegeterian, Pita Pan came to rescue. It's not that easy otherwise to find veg food options in Singapore.The location of the place is great. You can get a good view of the ArtScience Museum on one side while the Helix bridge on the other. There aren't a lot of tables so you might have to wait. If possible sit outside.Coming to food, we ordered the falafel platter followed by some spicy falafels. Though the food is slightly expensive, everything seemed fresh and inviting. The service is tad slow, so be prepared to wait. The falafels and pita bread is limited. Would say that the platter is good for two people. Since we were more, we ordered some pita bread separately.Overall go for this place for the location and if you are scouting for veg food. Taste wise you will not be raving about it but will not be too disappointed as well. The Humus should have been better though.They do have beer on the tap but none of us had it so not sure what was available

We went with high hopes given the claims around healthy, but were left wondering if the food was really fresh and the bread was really baked in house and fresh. The service wasn't great either, firstly we received a slightly dirty plate. We ordered a sharing platter and as the manager took our order he informed us that they didn't have dolmas (which were shown in the photo). He said they will replace it with some other salad but didn't let us chose what that would be. Some flexibility would have been nice!The price did seem a bit high to begin with, which we attributed to the location. But it definitely felt high given the food we ate and the service we received. They also levy the service charge even though you have to order at the till and collect at the counter.May be it was due to a dull tuesday night! But we were not at all impressed and will not be going back

We scoured this place out as we were craving a decent veggie meal, and were pretty certain we'd get it from a falafel establishment so we made our way to the Raffles Shopping Centre for Pita Pan.It took us about 5mins to figure out where within the shopping centre we were, and this place is right at the back of the food court. As another review mentions, part of the word vegetarian was not lit up on the sign, which is sort of what helped me to remember the name.The staff were very kind and, when we stated what we wanted, they said we could get a meal deal for a much more reasonable price. Myself and my girlfriend both opted for veggie falafel balls and we were able to select the salad we wanted from the salad bar. This was a bit like Christmas for us as we'd been travelling around Asia and had not tasted beetroot, carrot and hummus for a good while. We basically asked for every vegetable going and had a massive mound on top of our falafel balls. We're not really sure that was how it was supposed to be but this is what makes it memorable - some places can be really tight if you ask for extra sauce or something!It tasted great and the pair of us struggled to finish it. There was only one other person in the restaurant at the time but it was mid-week and during work hours, so we imagined it'd be much busier..The only real downside to this place was the price, given it was a fast-food type place, however we felt we got good value for money by the time we left

I ordered a Full Pocket Sandwich with Picante Falafels (Spicy *Hot*). The place has tasty options for either a Sandwich or a Fill a Pita. You can also get a Shwarma ( a veg option using soya chunks, didnt try though). The manager was a nice guy who gave out free falafels as we stood in the queue which was a real nice gesture. He kept saying its never too late for a Falafel :) And this place really has awesome falafels to gorge upon. Give it a try.You have to be mindful that the service charges are not included in the price, and the place is probably a bit overpriced. But then its a healthy option to eat good tasty food so I didn't really mind

We visited the outlet at Marina Square for lunch today in a group of 6 for what we hoped would be a quick lunch. The food orders were all pretty simple consisting of falafel and shawarma options. Unfortunately the service was very disorganised and it took about 20 minutes to prepare these simple meals, despite there being very few people ahead of us. When I eventually got my chicken shawarma I was quite happy with the meal: seemed reasonably fresh and tasty. But if you're in any kind of a rush then this is definitely not the place to visit unless you bring with you plenty of patience. Also, for about the same price it's actually possible to get a full 3 course meal at lunch time in Marina Square (for example, Nuvo or Addictions Cafe), so the question of whether this shawarma constitutes good value for money at lunch also arises (cost is about $15 for a shawarma as they hit you with a service charge, even though they don't actually have any true service: you order yourself)

Pita pan serves great lebenese food, Theres lots of variety and its reasonably priced, friendly staff.
It has outdoor sitting as well to enjoy Singapore weather. And they serve wine and ciders.
one of the best options for vegetarian food at the mbs

I finally canceled my order and asked for a refund. 30 minutes waiting for a Falafel Sandwich and they did not even start doing anything on it. The place was fairly empty.
5
It can be very hard for vegetarians in Singapore, especially in shopping malls. Pita Pan offers healthy Arabic platters that are fresh & flavorful. 1 Mediterranean platter is enough for 2 adults. If you're not that hungry, a pocket sandwich does well. For finicky kids that don't care for pitas, hummus & falafel,there's always French fries & Sweet potato fries. The only drawback: no desserts
1
The food is decent but the customer service on my recent visit was downright appalling. My friend and I stood at the counter for a few minutes trying to get the staff members' attention as we were in a rush. Instead of looking up and letting us know they would take a couple of minutes, both staff managed to deliberately ignore us the entire time. Fine, not a big deal. The man who appeared to be the manager eventually moved over to the cash register, glaring at us as though we'd dragged a dead cat into his restaurant. When my friend and I spent a couple of seconds figuring out what type of bread we wanted (we were planning on splitting a full pocket sandwich since we weren't that hungry), he flipped open his cellphone and took a call. We waited for him to finish. After finally placing our order, we asked if he could cut the full pocket into half for us, at which point he sneered contemptuously at us, replied that of course he couldn't, and that we would have to order two half pockets as he was running a business. To me, an important aspect of running a business well means keeping your customers happy, and this certainly isn't how you go about doing it. I will not be returning
1
Our family has been a fan of Pita Pan for all this while despite them using eggs in some items. But today was such a big let down to see this whole blob of chicken on a skewer hanging right in front of your face. When we asked the staff, they said this was a new item on the menu And ironically, the "VEGETARIAN" in their name was broken down to "RIAN" !

My good friend took me here for dinner because she knew I was a vegetarian. There was an appetizer platter with all sorts of veggies, like falafel, olives, eggplant-something, and so many more that I cannot remember. It was heavy enough to sub for a main course dish but my friend told me there were still pizzas. There was also pita bread, of course. The lime juice that was in these really big mugs was also delicious. I was in vegetable heaven! As much as I hate wasting food, I had to leave a lot of food on the table simply because I could not finish the spread before us, and I have a ravenous appetite. The service was also good -- one of the crew who was a Filipina attended to us very well. (Well, wherever you go in Singapore you will find a Filipino service crew who attend to their kababayan with extra special attention :)As for the price, well, I cannot say anything about that because it was a treat from my friend. This was my first dinner in Singapore since coming back after being away for so many years and I loved it

We popped in to Pita Pan after visiting the ArtScience Museum. We had a falafel platter, which included 5 pieces of falafel, cous cous, hummus, olives, chillis, salad and another dip like baba ganoush - as well as 2 pittas.Overall, the food was very tasty and the service was efficient and friendly.However, after paying, we noticed a 10% service charge and 7% tax. This wasn't made clear on the prices. Our platter, plus two fruit juices, came to over $40 / √Ç¬£20. Nice food, but expensive for what it is. But given the location, the high price is not surprising
3
I had been to Gardens by the bay recently and being a vegetarian I had no option to have anything inside.Me and my husband were searching for bayfront MRT and luckily passed by this restaurant.We had full pocket falafals...Falafals were tasty but I did not like the mustard sauce.Hummas was just ok.I found it a decent restaurant because of three main reasons ..Great view, veg option available,tasty falafals
4
We have been here a number of times so we can we can report that the restaurant has consistently presented good food and crap service over all the times we have been there. A recent visit has included an unpleasant smell around the entrance that is not inviting. however the falafel and salad choice are great. A bit of customer service training, like how to smile, would reap benefits
4
I was hungry and deseperate to find some veggie food when I finally passed in front of this place. The falafels were very tasty. The hummus was not as good but I had only a bit as I was already full with the 5 good sized falafels. Nice location and view. Do not expect any service or ambiance though, this is not the concept here
4
For a pita shop, I expect better pita bread - but I liked everything else.
Fabulous green and red shakshuka. Try it with chips, not pita!
4
Not everyone can afford to Dine at The Chef Restaurants but still continue the experience by eating at this fantastic Bistro Restaurant Pita Pan -which we discovered Opp the Museum - a Jewel - Hidden Away for vegetarians -tasty original food and reasonably priced -
4
Healthy, fresh& tasty... My all time favorite place. Location is also convenient ....close to shopping,office & sight seeing places.
2
 Dined here for the first time with my husband and son tonight, and we ordered full pocket meals. I have to say, I was highly disappointed with the service to begin with, and was shocked when we were charged $40 for our meal, even though it was stated as $15 per meal on the display board. The falalafel was tasty, but it's an absolute lie saying you get to "choose" your salads and sauces, they basically just slop on a bunch of salads and sauces on the driest piece of pita bread you'll ever find- I've seen worse at subway. The worst part was the cold fries we were served with. I understand the location is part of what you're charged for, but this place is ridiculous when it comes to value for money- needless to say I will not be eating here again!
2
Considering this place specialises in pitta bread and hummus I regret to advise that you should order neither hummus .....or pitta bread. The hummus is watered down gunk with no flavour and the pitta bread is microwaved. So disappointed. I mean it's a great place in theory to grab a drink ( the cocktails were great - just wish id had more before I tried the food) and the view across the bay is breathtaking, but how hard is it to get pitta bread and dip right? It wouldn't take much to turn this place around, just some effort and maybe a cookery book or two. Plus a smile from the staff who seemed wholly disinterested in my custom. It's a great spot for outside drinks (it's happy hour from 11am until 8pm- and that's earned the two stars) but take a packed lunch or risk wasting your money on terrible food
4
The Mediterranean Platter is good. Serves two. You may go for the Red Shahouska if you like something tangy. Its a very good location at the Marina Bay Sands, over looking some of the sights of the city. Evening is a recommended time to go there.
4
Vegetable shawarma?!!! Something i wouldn't have thought possible ; but that is what I had in my pita bread with various vegetable fillings and hummus ,all in a sort of take away tissue wrap ! Something that had only vegetables and vegetable shawarma could be so tasty is something I would not have in my wildest dreams ever have thought of. A meal for four with a beer thrown in for about 50 Singapore dollars is reasonable by their standards I would think. So pita pan as a pit stop is highly recommended 
5
Oh you have to hunt this place down in Marina Bay mall. But the hunt is worth it. The staff is very friendly and the food is just amazing. It was like an oasis as we were vegetarians. But I had one complain that many items on menu had already exhausted at 9 p
3
Had heard good review abt this place and went to try it out recently with family . We tried the Mediterranean platter which looked great and colour full but had very little main stuff to eat and it was full of pickles and salads.Have the say the Pita bread was nice and my wife liked the humus which I felt was nt smooth enough.Babakumus had a bitter taste not sure why and falafel were too crispy and it didn't feel like made of chick peas.Overall a very average not satisfying meal for us.
4
The food is good and the staff are friendly. It wouldn't hurt if Kunal would smile a little more though. Everything else is great. They have indoor and outdoor seating. The food is healthy and tastes good too. Perhaps a little above average in terms of price, but this is Singapore.I ordered the red shakshuka, which reminded me a little of arrabiata sauce. There were two poached eggs in it, which went well with a warmed pita bread. The full pocket falafel, which starts at about 11 Singapore Dollars (or 15 for a meal) was quite good too. Definitely worth a visit if you are at the Marina Bay Shoppes. Also a good stop over when you take the river cruise
1
The girls were very rude. They were bothered from our request of explanation of the sandwiches and other ingredients. It was complicated to understand what to order and in the end we didn't get what we expected. Besides the food wasn't very good.
3
Too good food , surprise to see pure veg restaurant in Marina bay shoppe , chef recommendations were too good , best for Lebanese options like Hummus / Pita and that Home lemonade is just tung twister . Must visit restaurant .
4
It is very rare to find a good, authentic middle eastern place in all of Asia. Fill a Pita and Pita Pan are 2 of them in Singapore. I have not tried Fill a Pita, but Pita Pan was surprisingly authentic. On the excellent Marina Bay location overlooking the promenade and the Science Arts Museum, this place serves fresh, piping hot pitas stuffed with various options. I had the falafels (they come in different flavors) with the toppings and salads of your choice. A side order of sweet potato fries was just decadent! There are fresh juices, and many different combo options. Prices are on the higher side consistent with most of Singapore, but given the location and the quality, well worth it. The only downside is that it is staffed (not sure whether owned) by Indians, and in typical Indian fashion, the service is surly with nary a smile or friendly gesture. But ignore that, and enjoy the meal on the outside booths
1
What a waste of a great location, I don't think they get any repeat customers at this place. The food is weak for fast food standards, and for the price they charge you could have a proper meal at a much nicer place. But the worst part was the service, long wait both to order and to receive your food - and no smiles - but they do add a 10% service fee. Avoid at all costs
5
This place is just outside the 'shoppes centre' next to the science museum. Pittas filled with falafel and an amazing choice of salads in a subway style. But the halloumi cheese and sweet potato fries are to die for as is the falafel itself. A full pocket meal is big in size and taste. Quite pricey but was so worth it, thinking of replicating the idea in the UK it was that good
1
Came here at 3.15pm on a Sunday, with the restaurant almost empty. Waited 15 mins in a queue to order and pay, with only 2 people in front of us and the queue growing longer and longer. There was one incompetent Aunty taking orders very slowly, and one person making up the food. Waited another 15 mins for our food, which was ok, but not worth the price, particular given a surcharge was added. Absolute cheek to even charge for such bad service, with us having to also go up to order and to collect our food! It was like being at Subway - except the service at Subway is more efficient. Does Subway add a surcharge?
5
Now this is a perfect 10 on 10!!Looking for something healthy? They have got amazing salads and skahshukas.Looking for tasty food? Try the full pocket Pita bread sandwich with yummy falafel for you hungry tummy.Ambience? It can't get better than being located at Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands!! And it's totally value for money. SGD 17 for a full meal!! \m
5
I had been a regular to this place. They have lots of options for vegetarians and their Sun dried tomato falafels are much more than yummy.A great place to have meal with view of River Singapura. So many times I have travelled all the way from Simei just to have their falafels ÔÅäFood is just toooo good
4
This restaurant is based in The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands and is on the outside so you get a great view of the river and Singapore skyline.If you fancy freshly cooked falafel with salad and great humus then this is the place to come
3
I have been to the branch in Marina Bay Sands several times and the service has gone from good to worse. But they have great vegetarian food with lots of variety. The best is their pita pockets with falafels. The food and drinks are very expensive ~$4.50 for just an ice tea!Service has gotten so bad these days I have to wait 15-20 mins for just a pita sandwich. Plus the staff seems they are not happy at all serving you and always look like they are in a bad mood. Twice I had to wait around 10 mins before someone took my order. The worst part was the person who was suppose to take the order was walking around completely ignoring us and everyone waiting in the line. If you are at the Marina Bay Sands then don't go to this place, instead head to the food court below where you can find cheaper food and better service
5
We love this kind of food so were excited when we found this restaurant. The falafel pittas are huge- plenty of salad and pickles to choose from. A little on the pricey side though!
2
Worst falafel pita ive had. Not really sure why they have so many options for pitas and falafel on the menu, because they do not have them.
4
We always go here whenever we are in the mood for good vegetarian options. Love the fries and pita pockets. A bit messy to eat but lovely stuff. Only sometimes, they run out of certain salad options and sauces quite early on in the evening (happened on my last visit to their marina square outlet). But, amazing food
5
We visited the branch at Marina Bay Sands a number of times and were not disappointed. The menu is varied, food is freshly made and the falafel is some of the best I've ever had. There are loads of different menu options, everything we tried was good! They tend to get busy but just get your food to take away and take a seat on the wall around the Art Science Museum and enjoy!* there are many vegetarian options available* prices are very good compared to many eateries in Singapore, especially in this part of town
2
Always nice to see a vegetarian restaurant and i like this type of food. It was a pleasant surprise to find this restaurant when we were hungry after alot of walking from gardens by the bay but unfortunately it was poorly organised. The menu was full of delicious options yet there was only one falafel option available/offered during the busy evening rush. Perhaps they just were understaffed but considering the high prices they were charging, you'd think they could afford to hire more help. Nice Tabouli Salad by the way(but again over priced) :)please improve

I am visiting this restaurant at Marina Bay Sands for the past year.Each time the food tastes wonderful. I always enjoy the hummus with mushroom.. its better than calling it yummy. My husband loves the piping hot shakshuka .But this week I again visited the restaurant and ordered our favourites again and were looking forward to our meal. But the pita bread which we received looked and tasted like honey pancakes. We were disgusted with the taste and the bread was sticky in the mouth. I approached the service staff wanting to clarify about the different pita that we received. She was laughing at my every question. Annoyed that she could not understand me, I walked over and asked another staff about the pita bread. I was amazed when she told me that what I received was pita bread. Was I really in Pita Pan? I was irritated that I was cheated of my pita bread as I know exactly what they looked and tastes like. My family was addicted to hummus and shakshuka with the pita bread. We were utterly disasppointed and would never visit this restaurant again if I am going to receive pancakes instead of the original pita bread. They should also train their staff to communicate well with their customers. It was an awful experience
4
We visited the Marina Square outlet. We had ordered a Mediterranean platter with Falafel and Mozrella Pizza. It was awesome we love the taste of platter. The veggies are so crunchy and sauces they served was very tasty. It is worth visiting. It is vegetarian outlet good option to try mediterranean food for vegetarian
5
My best falafel experience has been at Maoz. This is my answer to Maoz in Singapore. I went to the Pita Pan outlet in Marina Bay Sands. I ordered a sundried tomato falafel which came with a pita bread. Loved the softness yet crunchiness of the falafel, and the red/maroon colour made it more appealing. My boyfriend was full after his dimsums earlier, but on tasting the falafel, he wanted it. So we ordered a pocket meal- 5 basil falafels with our choice of salad, sauces, bunch of fries and diet coke. It was so heavy but super to taste. And I even got a student discount of $3 :-)Must try!
3
good as far as i am seeking Appetizers and Snacks for light lunch time the meal was nice and good i stayed in outdoor table they gave alarming bell formy order when it finish they do not serve bread with the hummusbut it is very expensive comparing to our countrie
2
Me and my husband thought of having Mediterranean cuisine over the weekend and after hearing so much about Pita pan from my colleagues thought of giving it a try. We had ordered a Mediterranean platter and extravaganza pizza and we had mentioned that we are ok with mushrooms in the topping along with other veggies. The taste of food was average and the topping just had couple of veggies and mushrooms were missing. I dont know why we were then asked about it while placing the order. The cutlery was also not of good quality hence we took the disposable one. To top that, I noticed that the waitress who was making the platter, instead of wiping off the sides of the platter with a napkin n cleaning her hands afterwards was insteads cleaning it with fingers n licking it..which left us feeling completely disgusted. May be won't be going again.
5
We loved the food, all of it... We ordered Mediterranean platter, Sabick and the full pocket falafel...
They just need to improve their service, they were short of staff. They need to re-arrange the location of beverages and cutleries,
5
Me and my husband been there twice and we had full pocket sandwich, platter, green shakshuka and red shakshuka. Thumbs up!!! To everything we had. Great Quality and perfect quantity. Also, good for vegetarians. I am a fan of their freshly baked pita bread. Not even expensive. Clean and lovely ambience. Though they do not have any meat in the menu i would still recommend to all my non-veg friends.Highly recommend this place to all veg and non-veg lovers
5
Absolutely love this place! Amongst a couple of friends and I, we ordered a Falafel half pocket (7.90SGD). All pockets come with a salad bar whereby you can choose what to add to it. Obviously our pocket was overflowing in the end! Our serving was not too dry, and was very generous. We also had the hummus (11.90SGD) which came with a pita bread, served warm. Again, nothing I can complain about, the portion was very generous and tasted very well done.It's a rather cosy place, with less than 5 tables on the inside, and around 5 tables outside. In the evenings, the breeze is great, and the view facing the river is all so good. The only nitpick I have is the erratic service of the two ladies! You could have them rolling their eyes and scowling at you at any moment, which leaves me wondering, really. Make peace, close one eye, and enjoy this place
4
For those of you who don't know, Pita Pan is a veg. restaurant. They do serve egg based dishes though. I've tried this place a couple of times and its been good.Their falafel and hummus is quite good. I've also tried their pita pockets and platter which I really enjoyed. They also serve regular beverages, juices and wines.The place can become crowded as its not very spacious. Besides its difficult to find a table in their four table open air seating section. But it's a pleasant little place.The restaurant can be approached from inside marina bay shoppe or marina bay promenade
4
It is a great restaurant for vegetarians (but the restaurant does serve egg, which is not veg as per Indian veg norms). Wwe happened to have had the owner herself serving at the restaurant and must say it made the service great. She was very patiently telling about all the possible options for us (considering we have lot of restrictions as we dont eat onion, garlic, potato and other root vegetables, no egg, no broccoli and the list goes on). But she worked out the option and mentioned that if the restaurant is informed a day prior or early in the morning then they can prepare special meals for people with specific requirements like no onion and garlic hummus.Great location, we went to the Marina Bay branch and it is facing the riverside with indoor and outdoor seating option. Loved the place
5
I have been visiting pita pan since they opened. There has been lots of changes and yesterday I had the best falafels there. I am proud to say now we have falafels in Singapore that are the same as having them overseas and even better. Well done guys.
1
Vegetarian food at Marina Bay Sands seemed too good to be true...and that's what it turned out to be! We were chastised for believing in this dream!Food: we ordered each flavor of the pita pockets: regular, basil and sundried tomato. There was no distinction between the three except for how "well done" the falafel was - burnt, more burnt and extra burnt, which essentially wiped out any semblance of taste from them.The Veggie 'Extravaganza' pizza was a joke with one olive, one small piece of jalape√É¬±o buried under a mound of cheese and sweet corn, smothered by a tasteless marinara sauce.Drinks: we ordered fresh juices- orange and carrot. After 30 minutes of our buzzer lying silent on the table, when we went to enquire, we were told that they hadn't started making the juices since they were backed up on drinks orders. We waited at the counter and got to witness the absolute gross way in which the juices were made: the lady just kept fishing carrots out of a bag and dumped them into the juicer- unwashed, unpeeled, uncut. Needless to say, we didn't touch the juices ($7 a glass).Service: where can we start on the service? We waited 30 minutes for our drinks and almost an hour for our food, which we eventually got only because we refused to move from the counter.When we complained about the terrible falafels, they offered to make us another sandwich (which we declined) but made no move to return our money, which was surprising considering the pita pockets weren't cheap at 12 bucks a pop.There weren't enough seats in the restaurant. When we asked if we could carry our food to the outside area to the stone benches, we were given a non committal- no idea, as a response.We finally managed to snag a table, which was covered with dishes from the previous customers and no one bothered cleaning the table, which we had to do ourselves if we wanted to have a meal...Overall a terrible experience, further worsened by a gigantic picture of the founder chef - Reena Pushkarna up on the wall, seeming to mock us!Thanks, Ms. Pushkarna for the worst dining experience ever

Pita Pan has an excellent location and great food. Its decent in terms of price and great in terms quality of food. Excellent falafel and they have options for vegetarians. I had gone in the evening and was seating outside, it was a great view as you can see the helix bridge and after the dinner you can talk a walk on the helix bridge too. Would suggest all the falafel lovers and only vegetarian eaters to visit this place
4
We've been to the one in Marina Square twice now and both times have been great experiences. I initially stopped because the sign said it was all vegetarian, but came back because the falafel is excellent. It is pricey (about $18 Singapore dollars per person for the meal), but then again, I ate every bit of it, which is somewhat unusual for me. I was surprised to see so many locals eating meals in the mall, but apparently they do. I'm surprised to see negative comments on the service because I thought the people were very nice
5
This was a nice surprise after visiting the MBS ArtScience Museum. Pita Pan is located right at the exit/entrance of the museum.The choice of pita fillings is fresh and tasty. Prices are very acceptable given the tasty food and central location. For two pax incl. drinks and pitas we paid SGD43
4
Food is good, suber pitas and falafel. good foodies paradise. would go there again and again. Should add something for the non-veggies also.

I've been to Pita Pan at the Marina Bay Shoppes area about 5 times in the last 2 months. The first time was a pleasant surprise to find that it was an all vegetarian place, which suited me just fine. We ordered the full pita pockets and were blown away by the falafel balls in the pita - which were astounding!! Very crisp and good texture. They had a variety of fillings/toppings to choose from and it was a breeze getting through the order and getting the food on the table. They have the pagers that are quite useful to know when you can pick up your food. You go to the counter when the pager buzzes and lights up, choose your toppings and go back to your table with the food. It was a good experience the first time and the location of this place is really good. Right under the arts and science museum gives you a spectacular view of the Helix bridge and the CBD, especially during the evenings.The next 4 times were a hassle to say the least. No one to take your order at the cash register and when they did come, they had such a frown on their face it seemed like such a chore to them. When they finally took the order, I returned to a very dirty table that I had requested them to clean. After 4 requests, someone grudgingly came and wiped the table, spilling some of the crumbs onto the floor. Again, the food made up for the "quality" of the service.The third to fifth visits (last one today) were exactly the same - had to wait 10 mins at the register to place my order. Everyone seemed to be doing everything other than taking orders. One lady finally turned up and she seemed to be the most dissatisfied employee there. She couldn't understand what I wanted and I finally got through to her. I had ordered Cokes as part of my order and I asked her if I could pick it up from the fridge and she said "No, we will call you". So I walked back across the debris strewn floor to my dirty table. Asked them 3 time to clean it up, no one did. Went back and asked them again. Someone came and wiped half the table and didn't bother about the other half. Luckily we had some wet tissues with us (perks of having a child around) and we wiped it clean ourselves. Waited 25 mins for our order and then when we finally got the food, I asked about the Cokes and the guy said "You have to pick them yourself from the fridge". They seem to be very disconnected about the modus operandi of serving cans of drinks to customers. Again, the food made up for the "quality" of service. But I did notice today atleast 3 different customers chatting among themselves about the service and one elderly lady complaining about what she had been served.All said, the food is really good, although a little pricey, but I don't mind since we really enjoy the food and the views on an idyllic evening.The restaurant is severely understaffed and the staff need to be more welcoming. I don't expect them to be courteous and smiling all the time, but they don't need to be rude or curt. I will definitely not recommend anyone to go there during the weekends or public holidays. I will recommend that you venture here at your peril, but the food is worth the hassle, atleast for us. Just remember to take tissues with you to clean your table and have lots of patience!

We sat just outside the main dining area, but close enough to feel the cooler air from the restaurant. Service was fast. Our host ordered two platters with a variety of vegetables and hummus, freshly baked pita bread, and the best falafel I've eaten. Go hungry! One platter would have been enough for three adults. If you want to watch the water/light show, check the scheduleand time your meal accordingly

Visited the place with my 6 year old daughter .Hummus was good and fresh . Pizza was a pitiful excuse with double dough.Sweet potato fries were ....well NOT GOOD.Salad bar is decent.Overall found the food way over priced and the quality lacking. Shame indeed - Could be much much better

We stumbled upon the Pita Pan by accident while we were wandering round the Marina Bay. I wouldn't say this was a restaurant as such so don't go expecting too many frills, however what you will get is delicious mediterranean, vegetarian food with a lovely seating area outside so you can watch the world go by. Although this looks like a well established chain, this is actually a one off so don't let its chain appearance put you off.We went back a couple of days after my first visit (even my meat eating boyfriend really wanted to pay a visit after missing out the first time) and again the food was brilliant. It's about 10-15 dollars a meal which feels very reasonable in Singapore. I admit I only had the falafel pita because it was so delicious but the other items on the menu looked amazing (there was some sort of spicy tomato ragu with fried eggs in a skillet that looked particularly impressive) and I could have happily worked my way through all of them.It should be noted that the staff are a little brusk and could probably do with a little customer service training though

Click: http://dairycream.blogspot.sg/2013/07/pita-pan-pocket-full-of-health.html for FULL POSTCame to Pita Pan, a Mediterranean bistro which offers salad, falafel and hearty Middle-East/Lebanese stews because I was craving for hummus. Pita Pan sounds like Peter Pan to me but it's not any happy fairyland restaurant. It was the poor service which ruined what could be a more pleasant experience.This is less like a restaurant at MBS and more like a fast food outlet as diners have to find their own seats and order from the counter (no signs stating that it was self-service). What was more hilarious was the servers at the salad counter told us to order at the cashier, but yet the cashier had been ignoring us as she was busy counting the cash.What can we do but wait before they were ready to key in our orders? The HALF-POCKET SANDWICH ($7.90), was assembled gradually like a subway sandwich. First, half a pita bread was filled with three chickpea falafel. Then, pick all-you-want from the salad counter ( I chose nearly everything), and lastly the dressing (I opted for the tahini dressing also known as sesame paste).The end result looked totally different from the menu but was very delicious, especially the golden-brown falafels. They had a crispy coating but were not too dry inside.Instead of the Middle Eastern breakfasts, we had the Hummus with Mushrooms served with pita bread ($11.90). The bread version here was warm, soft and fluffy. The hummus here was better than Onaka's version because they are not chilled nor too salty. It was extra creamy with generous amount of mushroom toppings. Not quite sure how healthy this was but my tummy was satisfied!Conclusion: Service aside, food was not too bad and portions are quite substantial. Unless they fine-tune the service here, I don't think eating here is any beneficial, especially for our mental health. For those who wish to check this out, bring your own water as they don't serve it

My family that is including my parents, kids and sisters family(9 of us) were staying at the Marina Sands hotel. We were recommended the Pita Pan restaurant by a friend who is a Singapore local. We landed up eating all our meals there as it was not only conveniently close for us but it tasty and healthy. We ate the half pocket sandwich. On day 1 we tried the meditteranean platter but that was too large and too much unnecessary items for us. The manager was friendly and helpful

The best falafel I have ever had with a great non-alcoholic mint mojito. This place is 100% vegetarian and everything looks nice and fresh. I had the basil falafel and I am totally going back for lunch again while I am in country. You must checkout this great spot

Pita Pan is a unique restaurant and offers a lot of options for vegetarians. There are only a handful of restaurants in Singapore that offer such a large variety of vegetarian delights and this is by far the best I have been to. We had the Pita pockets with a plate of hummus and mushrooms. The felafels are made fresh and you are given the option of topping up the pita pocket with a lot of salads, veggies and sauces. The salads and sauces tasted amazing and we really enjoyed the food. Will definitely be coming back for more here

Unlike most places in marina bay sands pita pan offers great value without sacrificing taste. I recently moved to Singapore and haven't really found many places I think are delicious and a good value. Pita pan s both! When I walked in one of the staff members greeted me and asked me if I had any questions. She recommended a red shakshuka dish and a full pocket meal to share between me and my friend. WHAT A TREAT! The shakshuka was a tomato based egg dish served with the softest pitas I ever had. The falafel sandwich was also very yummy. I filled up my pocket with veggies and with a few different sauces, this was really fun for me because unlike a lot of places you are not limited to only a few toppings. Instead you can fill it with whatever salad and sauces. So good and so filling!! During our meal my friend and I were almost out of pita that came with our shakshuka, a staff member noticed and asked if we would like another we said yes and began getting up to pay. But the staff member said "no mam please enjoy your meal and I will bring your check to you." Pita pan is not full service, meaning you order at the counter and pay then sit and wait or your food so the staff members gesture was very considerate and really put the icing on the cake. We both were shocked at how delicious and how much we ended up liking this vegetarian food since me and my friend are both big meat eaters. Pita pan is definitely the exception to the rule. Keep it up guys

Food is really amazing and even taste is also good with healthy dishes, lots of varieties are available but I tried Red Shakshuka it was amazing first time I had and started loving it !!!!!

Located right near the art and science museum, this is a great place to people watch while having a nice lunch/dinner. The pitas are great however I was expecting more choices like chicken or lamb bit they only had falafel. The hummus was great but they pita they served with it was cold to my tasting. Overall, I would go again but maybe I a few months or so. Nothing to hurry back to

Brought my wife here for our wedding anniversary as both of us liked falafel and hummus. No one tended to us at the cashier but that's fine. After 5 min manager comes and he was pretty friendly. Good. The bad part came when we were waiting for the food. As we sat near to the serving counter, we counted at least two disgruntled customers walking up to them and asking where's their food. After 20 minutes of waiting, my wife went up to them to ask where's ours. Rude male waiter said "sit and wait its coming", which made my wife pissed as most of the serving staff were just siting around and doing nothing. Rude male waiter retorted back loudly "you can complain to the management all you want" (mind you, he shouted at my wife), Took a platter and slammed it on our table. And so I did, I asked for his manager and told him that I will not standby while he insults my wife. Manger was apologetic and blamed it on "too busy today hence his reaction". Well if you can't manage the crowd, maybe you shouldn't open an eatery. He offered us two free drinks, but the damage was done. Bad experience, horrendous service, skip this place as there are other better food (and service) around marina bay sands

My family and I were visiting singapore last week and were staying in marina bay sands so after 4 nights of over paying for mediocre meals at all the high priced restaurants we found pita pan. Usually we wouldn't eat at vegetarian only restaurant but we were curious so we decided to try it. Best chance we could have taken. The restaurant was absolutely delicious! My husband and I had a full pocket sandwich and shared a red "shakshuka" ( a savory tomato based egg dish) SIMPLY AMAZING! The pita bread was so soft and everything was so fresh. And the best part was we didn't have to spend an arm and a leg to eat. Our bill was less than 35 bucks for both of us!! That evening after a business dinner we decided to go back to pita pan for a drink and were introduced to a pita rita. It was a margarita with an upside down beer in it. So yummy. As we drank the beer poured in and made kind of a fizzy margarita! It was great. Hands down the one of the best restaurants we have ever been to. Hope to see in the U.S. soon :

I think I had the best falafel pita ever. Tasty. Crunchy. The toppings I added worked well. Standard service but its a sit down place with no table service. But the food was superb. The sweet potatoe chips was Devine. Soft inside and crispy outside. Don't even have to have sauces. I will try to convince my friends to eat their as often as possible. I would say its very good comfort food.

Nice location serving vegetarian mediterranean dishes. Staff very friendly once you have been there a couple of times. Lovely location with outside seating...great to sip a glass of wine and people watch and later walk around the shoppes at Marina Bay Sands. A variety of sauces and salads along with good falafel. We have been there many times also taken friends and have never been disappointed with the food and service

My husband & I passed this restaurant on our way from the helix bridge into the Marina Bay shoppes mall and decided to try it. The place offers different variations of falafel and pita-based dishes, and they all taste really good. They have a huge selection of sauces which makes it suit any palate. Loved the red spicy dip with the pita pockets.Great option for vegetarians in Singapore, especially travelers!Also its open till midnight which helps on long days!I partially agree with another travelers review.. that the staffs attitude is a bit off, they aren√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢t as friendly as all other eateries, but the food made up for their attitude

The concept of the restaurant is a good idea. You can order your Pita and fill it with anything you like or let's say anything they offer (just vegetarian food). But besides Pita and falafel dishes, they also offer salads and some other mediterrenean dishes.I ordered a plate with mixed appetizers: couscous salad, eggplant salad, mixed salad, falafel, hummus and dolmades (wine leaves filled with rice) and some pita bread. Except the couscous salad and the dolmades everything was really tasty and authentic. The couscous salad was quite tasteless and for the dolmades the leaves were not tender.I also ordered some extra Halloumi cheese. 4 very little peaces (2-3cm each) for 2SGD... Eating 2 SG$ would have satisfied me more.Tables are inside the restaurant as well as in front of it

Good place, good area - and good food. So what went wrong ? The service. The staff at Pita Pan goes out of its way to be terribly rude to customers. I was there with my wife - who unfortunately had never been to a middle-eastern restaurant before. We shall give it a try, we thought. So, we went in and tried to chat up with the staff. Nopes. The two gentleman at the counter (Indian guys, I believe) were thorough in their training to ask customers off. On asking what was good and what could be ordered - I was nicely told by the gentlemen to look up the menu. And when I say nicely, I mean he just stopped short of slapping me right on my face. So I took the hint, ordered some half pocket thing and went along. I was given a number and was expected to linger on. Or go to my seat. I wasn't sure so I asked if I should go back to my wife and sit with her. "That's what the number is for" - I was told. He might as well have called me a fool. When the half pocket showed up - the guy shouted "10, number 10". And I reached up to the counter promptly - only to be shown a buffet of random salad and to be told "Pick what you want"., Pointing at the salad, the dude stared dead in my face. Without even a hint of amusement, glee or happiness - he was angry. About his job, his life - or me, perhaps. Or perhaps he hated the fact that people were showing up and ordering food quite contrary to the directions given by his superiors. Bless me, I said. I nudged him to get some on my plate. He did that. When done, I just shoved some sauce in and as expected I went back to eat. He continued on his quest to bully more customers. And I and my wife walked out - wondering how could such a good place survive in this high rent district with such a poor service. Note to Pita Pan Management: If you guys are on a quest to be hated by customers and locals - good for you. If not, please please hire people who would appreciate their job and who look forward to being nice to customers who pay for the whole party. You have awesome food and an outstanding concept - which is being ruined by your out of control staff. I'm a local and I won't be back to suffer the same humiliation I was meted out today. In short - fire your staff

we really enjoyed the vegetarian, middle-east cuisine. Casual, fresh and excellent taste. We will be back often ! The sauces are great, the pitas are delicious and (we did not expect that), we had some of the best fries ever.

Very delicious and healthy food. Fresh vegetables, falaffel and pita bread. You can choose from a lot of items to create your own filled pita bread. Only disadvantage: quite expensiveTry to get a seat outside and enjoy the view of the marina bay and the museu

Hi I am a tourist from UAE and one of my friend recommended to this place.We went there on Christmas Eve for our dinner. We ordered Meditterrean platter hummus with chick peas and sandwich pocket meal. All the food are really fresh even falafel also. The best falafel that we had outside my country. The babagounsh little bit thin but taste good The service is prompt we noticed that they have less staff working but still all are very fast and attentive but seems very tired.The management can hire some more staff to improve the service better All my kids enjoyed their food. We will visit again. Everyone must try

Walla I am from the middle east and have been looking for some good food that reminds me of home, pita pan did just that. The falafel was sooooo good with the humus and I also tried the shwarma yummy . I recommend this to all those looking for some great middle eastern food

Quantity and quality of the food great, prices are reasonable and taste of the food mwah.....I have been living in singapore for 4 years and this is the first time to Pitapan. So we ask the staff for recommendation and finally we ordered for falafels,hummus and red shakshuka.The falafels and hummus really awesome. We enjoyed with our friendsMust tr

We stopped off for a bite to eat and a drink. Ordered the mediteranean plate which was very very good. Large size and definitely good value for money with stuffed vine leaves, falafel, hummous and chick peas, pita, baba ganoush. We expected the portion to be small as the picture wasnt representative and so ordered extra hummous and pita. A great place with very good food. Service was ok for Singapore

Service v slow look like pay low work more kind of south Indian cafe .I go for dinner. The big joke is they never give water man t make the cash counter not smile never give .mhmy change back his english is from south India if u hugry dint go v poor

Food: Pretty good. The green shakshuka is excellent. Everything is vegetarian so do not expect any merguez spicy lamb sausage to be included in the shakshuka. The felafel is pretty good, but very small. The hummus is excellent. Ambiance: Super casual, open air. Service: Average Singaporean service (ie, not very good).Important note: these guys charge for tap water which is obviously not acceptable. The great majority of restaurants in Singapore serve tap water free (and rightly so). Do restaurants really need to nickel-and-dime their customers for tap water (and in doing so encourage the consumption of bottled water which is not environmentally friendly)? Obviously not...

We went there for lunch after our 10 km run. Wanted to treat ourselves with good food and had heard good things about the place.The food was good no doubt but the service n the employees are so very sad that even good food cannot compensate for the depressing atmosphere.The person who mans the register seemed like he hated people in general, a scowling face and provided no help with the menu. The people clearing the table and serving also looked as if they needed a boost of cheerfulness.When we arrived there were no empty tables in the shaded area. But they could have made a table for four by joining 2 tables that were half unoccupied. First place, no one even bothered (there were 3 people behind the counter) that we are looking for a table. We had to walk up to the grouchy man at the register and request him to join the tables. When we went to order the grouchy man forget about greeting, didn't even help with the menu n had the expression like 'why are you wasting my time?'The food is good but over-priced I felt. A full-platter which costs about S$27 comes with a pita pocket that is cut into 4-5 tiny lil pieces, some hummus, baba ghanoush, 2 pieces of dolma and 4 falafel, a wee bit of salad, 4 green olives that's all. The Ice Lemon Tea from a can costs S$6!!!Overall a terrible experience. Except the food was fresh and the only cheery bit was the huge smiling picture of the chef. I think the chef needs to be around to inject some of her cheerfulness to the place

We ordered full pocket pita bread came with 5pcs of falafel and we chose the vegetable from their salad bar that has good and many selections of vegetables and there are 5 difference dressings. I shared it with my 2 friends as our afternoon snacks. Taste good and regret it only tried once when we were there.other customers who sat next to our table, ordered Shakshouka which looks appealing & tempting.. the price is reasonable, less than $8 if am not wrong. It located at the bayfront The Shoppes
