Good place for vegetarians, i like the buddha bowl üòç will come back as soon as possible, new favorite place!
5
Kitchen by food rebels creates awesome food variations. The stuff was super friendly, you felt welcome and the food was superb. It is in a side street which gives this place a bit of freedom. Ill come back!
5
Great variety of gluten and dairy free dishes and desserts! We ate zucchini noodle bolognese and it was delicious:) Super nice place to visit !:)
5
Great fresh food, super friendly staff, delicious beetroot choc raw cake. If I lived in Singapore, I'd go there often.

Had a wonderful breakfast here! The staff were so friendly and the food was very good I got the gluten free toast with avocado and egg as well as an organic Apple juice which was really nice not ok badly priced for gluten free food $20.50

ordered an ultimate breakfast which cost $15 no gst or service charge. the food is prepared fresh - and if im not wrong healthy oils are used rather than the fatty ones. have placed several takeaway orders before and they have always been very friendly and accomodating to my requests, no matter how laborious. the plate looked small, but after a couple of mouthfuls i was full already! i guess thats what healthy food does for you. im more of a junk foodie, so enjoying a healthy dish is genuinely a new experience. that, and avocado usually makes me puke - but for the first time i actually managed to eat it - and it was crazy creamy and good. craving that grass fed beef rn.

Just dropping by to say Kudos for offering delicious, healthy and safe food for people like my situation facing such dietary restrictions. Much appreciation as it is extremely comforting to be able to dine out happily without worries, especially made more lovely when the food are so awesome! :)

I ordered breakfast and lunch here. The acai bowl was expensive & inedible. Minimal traces of acai, part of it still frozen, more like a weak flavoured slushie with some seeds on top. It went in the bin.Managed offered to replace the dish although it never arrived.
3
I like what this restaurant is doing, but the lunch is a lot better than their breakfast. To the point I'd say don't bother going their for breakfast - there are better options in the area. However the lunch menu is great. Go for the salad or buddha bowls
5
We were on a hunt for organic healthy food for brunch and this place hit the spot! What was even better was that they were able to make coffee with coconut milk! I am from the UK and I have missing coconut coffee from Pret A Manger in the UK so I was really happy they served this. They do a wide range of delicious foods and drinks. It's a must visit.
5
Welcoming environment, delicious healthy food, large portions, I had the vegan salad it was soooo good and great coffee ‚ù§
5
Delicious food! Healthy, organic, nice service and food atmosphere. Great place for lunch. Here every week :)
5
Lovely food, healthy which comes fast. Great selection of coffee and drinks, including coconut milk instead of cows.
5
Excellent food! The a√ßai bowls excellent! This place have many options for everybody! Gluten free-vegan...
5
We came here looking for a fresh and healthy breakfast and we weren't disappointed. Food was absolutely delicious with great variety - offering anything from cooked breakfasts to cooling acai bowls. The coffee was also great!
We look forward to visiting again.
5
Have brunched and lunched a few times now and always leave with the happiest taste buds, tummy and mood. Brilliant service, food comes fast and it served with a smile. A very rare gem to come across in Singapore! Accommodates all food dietaries.
5
So happy that this place is so close to my new office. Feeling like pigging out, can do. Feeling like need to eat more sensibly, can do. Want just vegetarian, can do. Want lots of protein, can do, and healthy too. Got really excellent coffee and juices. Really my favourite lunch place in Amoy Street area now
5
For those that are health conscious and looking for food full of flavour and made with love then you got to get into Kitchen. Great breakfast and I have 2 favourites. Coconut Oat Pancakes (ask for extra maple syrup) or the Rendang Egg Benedict (ask for the rendang sauce on the side) where the sweet Potato has makes this a great gluten free breakfast! The coffees could be a little larger. Only regret...wish it served bloody Mary's with Saturday breakfast
5
If you are a lover of heathy & organic restaurant, I recommend this restaurant to you! We ordered salad, soup which are all made of healthy fruits and veggies. We loved the avocado lime cake. According to them, they only use refined sugar for the cake & desserts. You should come here and try!
4
We enjoyed a yummy tasty and a little bit different breakfast here. The food was really good and the eggs were delicious. Excellent service and had a really good vibe. Coffee had a unique taste to it which was different to what we are used to. Maybe the bean variety they used at that time. Definitely recommend it.
5
Very full, but for good reason, the food tastes great, it is good for you and priced reasonably. Would return and recommend.
5
Stopped by for lunchtime and ordered a buddha bowl that was fresh plenty and delicious. Nice to have a healthier foodoption here in the center. Def not the wallet friendly but it is worth it. Staff isfriendly and the atmosphere is good to stick around.
5
Had a really nice meal last friday, couldnt decide what to have and eventually chose the chicken protein bowl which was really good. Looking forward to my next visit!
5
Good friendly staff and interesting combinations! Will be back for more. Tried the zucchini Bolognese and banana cake
4
Lovely atmosphere and great breakfast for all those with funny tums! Loads of gluten free and dairy free choices.
5
Yummy hormone free chicken burger!! Very satisfied. üëç can't believe it's hormone free üê£will definitely return. They also have bulletproof coffee

Was super excited about trying the Brunch at Kitchen - the food sounded interesting and wholesome. We had the Sweet Potato Rendang, The Veggie breakfast, an Espresso Mocha Smoothie, & a Latte. The Sweet Potato was quite a disaster - three slabs of barely roasted or seasoned sweet potato on a plate with two poached eggs and Rendang sauce. The sauce was the only saving grace. The portion was small for the price, which was probably a good thing because the dish barely tasted of anything. The Veggie Breakfast was passable at most - the eggs, mushrooms, and tomatoes were leaky and wet, not cooked particularly well.The food was a giant disappointment. It's unfortunate that the terms 'brunch' and 'healthy' seem to automatically be associated with a high price tag when the final product is sub-standard
5
I'm Italian, very picky and into healthy nutrition, been living in Singapore since 2014 and I can honestly say that this is the best organic choice in Town. I strongly recommend to try this place. Very high quality and clean food and Ms Elika is extremely kind and very helpful person! Thanks very much we will be back soon !

I had the pancakes and that was for sure the wrong choice. Three very small pancakes. Taste was very good but it was just not enough. My girlfriend had the rebel brunch for $2 more which was an average size. However her smoothy for $9 was also very small. Also the fridge was not cold enough. The coconut water was warm (bleh). Music also a bit too loud. Unfortunate experience I guess
5
I visited food rebel and I was stuck for choice as to what to have. The staff were helpful with their recommendations and I decided on the vegan sweet potato Buddha bowl....best choice as it was so so so delicious. I was full for hours afterwards so the value for money is amazing!

Delicious healthy and organic food which is hard to find in Singapore but servings are small for the $$$ which is a shame.
5
Went here for lunch today, had their chicken burger and zoodle bolognese and excellent coffee. All winners. Vegan options available. Great smiley staff.
5
I was delighted with healthy and sumptuous food offerings. The service is great and prompt. I went for a set lunch which had a delicious lentil and carrot soup along with Veg Malaysian Curry and Brown/Wild Basmati Rice.
5
Came here for breakfast after traveling through Asia for 3 weeks I needed a vegetarian meal that wasn't from a buffet. This was delicious and the coffee was great! Thanks
5
Lovely place in the best area of town with an amazing HEALTHY food and drink menu. When I come to singapore I can't eat somewhere else because i haven't found a place that beats this one in all the things that are important to me.
5
If I relocate the office now, my options are limited; why's that? Well, I have to be in walking distance to Kitchen for lunch. I eat here for lunch more than anywhere else for two great reasons: health and ambiance. Soups and Protein Bowls are my favorite.

Still going strong after fall off the wagon Thursday (1st Thursday in February when New Year resolutions often fades), this is a good place for conscious dining. The emphasis is on organic food. Ambience: nice casual & hip vibe. I had the Acai berry bowl. Looks pretty but smallish. Tasty & healthy.
5
We met friends there for brunch. I had read the reviews and we were not disappointed. The staff are very welcoming and friendly and the waitress explained how the menu worked and how to order.I had the sweet potato chips with bolognese and the others had the avocado breakfast. They were really tasty and reasonably priced too. Cool decor as well. The only negative was staff removing plates one at a time while we were still eating. Please leave plates until everyone has finished

Guys, this is the best. Plenty of vegan options, great attitude, great staff, amazing food. We went there three times during our three days in Singapore. The avocado lime cake is something I can still taste when I close my eyes now, it's texture is amazing. The only thing I wasn't impressed with was espresso, I found it too sour, but then again - I think I'm not into coffee any more. But I really wanted to combine it with my toast which was great. Have it with some extra sauteed mushroom! It's a shame I didn't get to try their dinner menu as we only made it for morning and on Sunday they were closed. Hope to come back and have the avocado-lime cake again!

tiny cafe, a little hard to find, but great whole food. you can only get breakfast til 11:30 then lunch from 11:30 - 5:30, closes at 6. you order at the counter and they bring food to your table, some high tops outside on sidewalk. good wifi. owner tries to source organic and sustainable food. their motto is "eat good, feel good", so true..
5
Absolutely great value for money!! Healthy, tasty and all-organic functional food with great service!!!! Highly recommended!

I had one of the Kitchen Food Rebel's Buddha Bowls and it was delicious! Very friendly staff and the best espresso
5
Very nice lunch and service!!!! Vegan bowl is perfect!!! It's so difficult to find something vegan in Singapore... especially if you eat organic food... I will recommend this cafe for my friends))
5
I was visiting singapore and my friend who lives in the area took me here. I was hoping it might be a welcome change to the rich stogdy food I had been eating all trip, but it was way more than that. I had one of the best bowls of zucchini bolognese I've had anywhere and a decent flat white. A welcome change to all the starbucks! Nice friendly staff as well. If I visit Singapore again this place is definitely my first stop off the plane
5
This is the best place I could find in Singapore for tasty and healthy food. Everything is organic with no salt and sugar. Amazing quality and excellent service! Enjoy everything on the menu, but especially love barramundi with Asian sesame greens, vegan sweet potato and chickpea bowl, chicken protein bowl and a pumpkin salad.
5
Upon moving to Singapore I investigated vegan food options, of which there were not many. After close to two months here I finally made it and I will be back in plenty of times again. I had the bulletproof coffee (coconut butter) and chia seed dragonfruit bowl. Both very good. Nice staff and owner Elika is sweet, knowledgeable and started this place due to her own frustrations of not being able to find the food she wanted to eat in Singapore upon moving here 4 years ago. I vote for more of these cafes!!!!
5
Finally found this little oasis after following their so yummy pics on Instagram. And finally I'm about to put my hands in a delicious chicken protein salad.Totally worth the walk from my office Staff is super friendly and welcoming, which is a big bonus too! Cheers for more beautiful places like this!

Kitchen by Food Rebel supplied catering for small workshop sessions held for a corporate event with a ‚Äòwellbeing‚Äô theme. Elika and her team were so flexible with our requests, provided custom menu items to fit our brief and served us fresh, delicious, wholesome food, which kept the clients and our staff energized and feeling full and satisfied. No afternoon slumps with food that was free from sugars, gluten and dairy, and healthy choices to complement our event theme. Everyone was very impressed! The sugar-free, gf banana loaf was a hit, plus the Chia Seed Puddings. The custom rice paper rolls and homemade slow roast beef wraps ‚Äì amazing

If you're looking for organic, gluten free, and all around fresh and healthy ingredients, Kitchen Food Rebel is the place to eat! I had the avocado toast with eggs, and thought it was very fresh and the light portions weren't too filling. The coffee is delicious and the environment was light and inviting. Great cafe music tunes too!
5
I was looking for a healthy yet delicious cafe in Singapore and found what I was looking for at Kitchen! I ordered the buckwheat porridge with homemade cashew butter and it was so different and satisfying! I spoke to the owner for a bit as well and she was very friendly and open to customer feedback in order to provide the optimal experience at her cafe. They just opened in January of 2016 so they are the new kid on the block and well worth a visit if you haven't yet discovered it!
5
This place is fantastic, so healthy and yet so tasty! So many options for so many different diets! Definitely worth a try
5
Love Kitchen by Food Rebel. Their food is out of this world delicious and so healthy!
The staff are friendly and helpful.
I wish it was a little closer to me but if I am ever in the area, I will always stop in.
5
The best place to go in the CBD area for good wholesome and healthy meals and snacks! Clean eating was never this accessible and yummy!
5
Love coming here, you know you are always going to have an excellent wholesome meal. It's worth every dollar!
5
I go here all the time with colleagues, for coffee meetings and on my own too for some clean and healthy food. The staff are so friendly and welcoming and every dish I've had there has been amazing :) highly recommended Elika and her team
5
Exzellent Food good Service reasonable Price And on top also healthy with Bread there i Never eat in a Quality like this before in Singapore

Love this place! Delicious and healthy food served by friendly staff. Wide menu do Everyday comforts without the guilt.
Even deliver via Deliveroo.
5
I love and appreciate the effort that Elika (the owner) and her staff put into sourcing clean, organic and delicious ingredients for their dishes, which are full of flavour and texture. Their concept of 'healthy eating = delicious eating' goes hand in hand with my lifestyle and eating. Highly recommended
5
I can't rave about Kitchen by Food Rebel enough. It's my go to for the best healthy and delicious breakfasts, lunches and snacks in the CBD (and indeed, Singapore in general). I love everything I've tried on their menu and favourites include their Buddha Bowls (think quinoa with hummus, chickpeas, sweet potato, chicken etc), avo on sourdough rye, and the baramundi with asian greens. The refined sugar free cakes and deserts are also amazing (try the turmeric cake, carrot cake and cacoa fudge). The staff are lovely and the chefs do an amazing job creating some of the tastiest food I've eaten anywhere. They focus on organic food with no added preservatives/crap and you know what you're eating is always clean, energising and nutritious. Elika (the owner) also runs awesome nutrition and lifestyle workshops regularly at the cafe too, as part of her Elika Fit Health coaching practice. Thanks a lot Elika and Kitchen by Food Rebel team. Please keep up the good work. x

I only wish this place was closer to home so i could eat here more often. I've been here twice and both times ordered the Vegan Buddha bowl and another salad to share with a friend. The servings are huge so go with a healthy appetite. You really do feel like you are eating a whole bowl of goodness. There's lots to choose from on the menu but it's hard to go past the salads and bowls as they are so tasty and filled with lots of variety. The raw sugar free desserts are also very tempting. I had a raw mango slice which was delicious. The matcha tea on the other hand was very bland and disappointing. I won't be rushing back for that.
