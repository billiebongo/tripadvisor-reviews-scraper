I came here with a friend and we stopped for the Chaat and a quick beer. The staff were friendly and the food was tasty. Everything I could want.

Nice little restaurant located in Science Park. Went there for dinner several times. I guess a-la-carte is available, but the buffet is great - so no need for it. There are two options: either choose from 6-7 vegetarian dishes plus dessert (~8S$) or additional 3-4 non-veg dishes (~12S$). Free rice and unlimited, fresh Naan (Indian flatbread; variants: plain, butter, garlic). Food is very good. Went there with an Indian friend and he agreed. Staff is also very nice. Fully recommended
