What a delightful little shop. We had some good bagels here (could have used a little more salt, but nonetheless). The vibe is great and they put a lot of effort into their product.
5
Had the raved-about LOX bagel.. No wonder it is so raved-about, as the salmon and cream cheese really melt in your mouth! Not v cheap but v good! Will come again!
5
I had the Lox Bagel with salmon and red beads. And even though I don't like beads, the Bagel was incredible. In fact, the best I ever had so far. I can so recommend this place.

I’ve been in Singapore for a year, unfortunately I’m moving back home and one of the biggest things I’ll miss is living near this place so I can eat their awesome bagels every weekend :(The guys that run it and work there are amazing, only bested by the delicious bagels that fly off the counter minute by minute.Be warned though, only go here if you’re prepared to have to revisit again and again because you can’t get enough of their fantastic food...!Avo-baco & fungi are two of my favourites, but I’ve worked my way through the whole menu now and each one is outstanding. Good luck to all the gang at TMBH for the future, I’ll miss you.

Haven't been here in a while and they've undergone some renovations. Bagels have become bigger and better- stacked with ingredients! The crowd age lines have also grown. I had the sriracha chicken bagel which was thick, greasy and delicious. Also had the pistachio bagel with cream cheese and nutella- bam! Probably too rich to have every week but certainly the place to go to when the bagel cravings hit
5
Breakfast bagels are brilliant! So over filled with goodness and a choice of bagel from regular to rye...A choice of schmears (smear of your choice e.g. Cream cheese to veginite) with add ins to fillings which could be overwhelming... depending on your hunger, fun to share or enjoy it alone. My fave was the avo-baco on rye which included avocado, bacon, egg,tomatoes, greens and aioli. Highly recommend, eat in or take out. Excellent friendly service.

good bagels, good service, price high for bagels.. but the most important thing about this place is the following:1) garbage disposal you have to clean up after yourself - which is fine , but garbage bin extremely full, smells, and flies near diners2) these bagels pack 99999 calories each (slightly exaggerated but you get my point) - if you eat one of these you can feel diabetes / heart attack coming in instantly. Maybe the restaurant shoulder consider posting the caloric content of these bagels..or probably just don't eat here so often

I rarely use the word awesome but I really was impressed by the taste experience. Me and my family ordered an avo-baco, Turk and brisk. All where fantastically different. It all started worrisome since they were out of bagels and also sold out on the mango shake. The lemonade was great though We will be back. Thanks

I used to have breakfast at this place. There are variety of bagel sandwich and I simply loved them. Must try them.
5
Great spot for the best bagels in town and decent coffee. Very casual, but awesome! Can get busy - popular! Very friendly service from the staff. Love the TAB bagel.
5
Great premium meats and freshly baked bagels on-site. As good as it gets for if you are looking for real bagels in Singapore. Most bagels in cafes are usually frozen.
5
These is one of the places you only find using Tripadvisor, if you're a Bagel-lover it's a must!
Nice staff, possible to pay by card, take-away also possible. Photo: A.B.L.T.

Two bagel breakfast with one lemonade (a small plastic container) and one orange juice (a small bottle). Total cost: $31. The bagels are just bagels, nothing fancy, not bad. But something is wrong with the Singapore economy if the simple meal could be this expensive.
5
Tried first time the new SPAM bagel which is delicious. The Q started on a early Sunday morning at 9am. Next time would try their crafted bagelwiches.
5
Absolutely delicious, tasty, fulfilling bagels! The average person will be stuffed with one of their gorgeous sandwiches! In my group of friends we have the Lox, Porky and Piglet bagel sandwiches. As everyone can pick the bagel flavor, we all got different flavors, all of which were delicious on their own and very flavorful. The texture of the bagels were great, good dense, chewy, great with the generous fillings inside.Every sandwich was stuffed beautifully, they definitely pack them well which is something that is much appreciated when it comes to a sandwich meal. Everything was great, definitely will be going back again for more

Sriracha ($12.90) is part of Two Men Bagel House's savoury Bagel offering. The Cajun Spiced Chicken Thigh was too heavy on flavour for me, but I loved how tender the meat was. The Rocket Leaves & Sriracha Aoli (not as spicy as you think it'd be) were delicious & paired well with the Black & White Sesame bagel I opted for.Felt like something simpler on the palate to end off the meal. Chose a Maple Pecan Cream Cheese Bagel ($4.90) & it did not disappoint. Had difficulty deciding which flavour of Bagel to go for, so we asked for the waiter's recommendation & he said the Sea Salt Bagel would go well. It did! So simple, so light, so good
5
Very nice bagels. Nothing to add. Very very good. We had one with salmon and cram cheese and second with avocado, bacon etc. Both were great. Make sure to pop up early for the breakfast as the place is next to supermarket and can be noisy

We read about this place and decided to visit this eatery. We arrived at about 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. The eatery was not full, but we had to wait for a table for 6.We ordered a variety of bagels combinations, from cream cheese, peanut butter and jam, steak, piglet, porky, etc. The service was fairly quick. We did not have high expectations but we thoroughly enjoyed the bagels, and they were all eaten up in no time.The eatery is hip, blasting out music and helmed by youngsters. Service is courteous and there is a good variety of choices. It's obvious that the customers enjoy the bagels. When we were there, 2 guys who had finished their meals bought another one each (to go). Noticed that there were more foreigners than locals while we were there.

I enjoyed eating here twice during my stay in Singapore. The bagels are nice and chewy with fresh toppings. A good fast(ish) food option with nice, cheery staff and good music playing!
5
The staffs are lovely and the piglet bagel is just amazing, you guys did it well! Definitely will come back again
5
I recently discovered this hidden gem in Tanjong Pagar area. The Bagels are great and definitely NYC style. Will come again for sure. Would recommend TAB for veggie lovers with wholegrain bagel.
5
Great little spot for a cup of coffee and a yummy bagel. Inside the Icon Village Extension... not to far from the Tanjung Pagar MRT.
4
If you looking for homemade bagel for breakfast, this is the place to check out. Nice and crispy bagel with various topping such as BBQ pull pork, vegimite and etc.
5
Hungover, hungry and looking for quality I stumbled into this heaven. Don't walk past. Get amongst it. They dont serve disappointment.
5
Before coming to Singapore for a couple of days I had a look where the best eats in the city where and I came across this place. And WOW it was worth reading those reviews as this place is AMAZING!! We had a great lunch everything we had was worth it with every bite! Our savoury bagels where so good that we had to try on of the sweet ones and it was just as good as the first bite. If your in the area you must go!

Singapore is a fantastic place to indulge. The whole country should be awarded a Michelin star. TwoMen is no where close to top restaurant quality but it serves very good coffee and bagel sandwiches. The flat white is good and comparable to some of the best in Melbourne. I recommend the Pork Mi bagel (I know there are Jewish people fainting).
4
This resto was a pleasant surprise.Didn't know that bagel can be transformed into an interesting lunch option. There are many items on the menu, but I chose the Babe variety in a plain bagel. It had Montreal bacon, scrambled egg, fresh tomatoes, melted cheese with parsley. Filling and tasty. It was a good lunch experience. I will be back.
4
Hand crafted bagels made with care. The food and coffee were excellent. Service nice, too bad they insist on blaring the music. I guess if it's too loud, I'm too old. Oh well, we put up with the noise, because the food was so dam good
5
One of the best breakfast bagel sandwiches I've had. Super fresh bagels and ingredients. Will come every morning I'm here in Singapore.
5
The food here is really good and the guys running the place are very friendly.
A bagel is a decent meal and I don't think you will leave still hungry.
Everything is fresh cooked and there is a really good range.
5
Not too expensive and nice bagel. It is located inside of the building. Abut hard to find it.................................
5
This is by far the best bagel I could get in Singapore. Very good bagel and creations. Great coffee and friendly service
5
I was really impressed with this place. When I woke up craving a bagel in Singapore, I figured I should set my expectations pretty low (I'm from New York), but my meal was delicious, and the staff were wonderful. Highly recommend this place - I might even go back before I leave!
5
My first time here & I will definitely be back. Prepared fresh & served hot- a really hearty breakfast that kept me super full. The ingredients went so well together too. Can't wait to try the other stuff on the menu.I had the Rodeo ($12.90 nett) - Roast beef, sweet onion relish, cheese, mustard, rocket leaves. & I chose a garlic Bagel. Cash/NETS only Air-conditioned seats, but not many  No WiFi availableNo service charge or GS

Who would believe bagels like this in Singapore. Simply amazing! Fresh, huge, flavorful. The sandwich is stuffed and you leave very satisfied. All of the ingredients are excellent. Our only regret is we went back later to buy some of their flavored cream cheese and they close when they are sold out. YES, they do sell out and close. DON'T WAIT
5
We basically have it every weekend and my partner LOVES IT! Highest quality, rich with the ingredients - they don't skimp on it! Everything is really fresh and tasty. You can choose the base (sea salt is the best) and then the rest from a wide variety in the menu, including vegetarian. For me - it's breakfast and lunch as well, as the portion is quite big.Also, the team which is making it, including baking the bagels itself is great and friendly! Young guys, it's their only shop so far!They are inside of ICON Village, in front of Cold Storage and are also a "party place" during the weekend for all the regular clients who come there! We love it
4
Located by Cold Storage, a simple and creative shop, nice ambience, nice music. I am here around 3pm, very slow, but can imagine lack of chairs furing lunch rush. I tried the Lox for 12 bucks. Very happy about it, generous lox portion, all the ingredients blend in well, very tasty. A bit pricey, but worth it. Will come back and try the special YOE (roasted lamb). Maybe I should get a part time job so I can eat here everyday.h

For photos and more reviews, go to hungrybaker.coTwo Men Bagel House is THE place to go for yummy bagels!It has been so long since I had a delicious one, prolly some 10 years ago in Vancouver. Now there’s no need to look back and reminisce!You can buy the bagel by itself in different flavours, and with a schmear of choice too.I went straight for the bagelwich though. LOX IS ALWAYS CALLING MY NAME! I’m glad my wheat allergy is easing up a little, enough for one bagel a week! (:When I arrived around 10am on a Sunday, there was a queue and the few high tables and short tables there were rather filled up. It’s more an eat-and-go sort of place, than a cafe. The lighting was really dim, but perhaps the Two Men behind the Bagel House are trying to project a grungy look. Don’t worry, the food will brighten up your day!We ordered a Lox ($11.90) – Norway cured salmon served with cream cheese, house-pickled red onions and beets,capers and dill herb salad – and A B.L.T ($9.90) – Montreal smoked bacon served with avocados, fresh greens and fresh tomatoes. You can choose the flavour of the bagel when you order too, they include black and white sesame, onion, garlic and multi-grain.We also got two cups of coffee with milk ($5). It’s no flat white, but it’s alright.There’s quite a wait for the bagelwich, but it is definitely worth it! By the way, if you’re the kind who gets lost (like me), Two Men Bagel House is inside Icon Village, right opposite Cold Storage on the first floor (

Fantastic quick lunch spot, verity of fillings for the bagels is great and the inhouse baked bagels are unique for Sing. To top it off all the crew are Super friendly and remembered my name after 2 visits.
5
really tasty and so many choices always good, not the cheapest though! i tried the "hog bagel" juicy pulled pork. Also had a "rodeo" before of roast beef really tatsy and very good!
4
One of the best bagel places i ever tired. I have been to this place at 3 times trying different types of bagel. Trust me all 3 were hits in my opinion. Staff are cool and friendly as well. Be sure to check them out.
5
Brilliant bagels and a great variety to choose from. Honestly couldn't fault the food and I can't keep going back!!
It would be good if they did some sort of sides to accompany the bagels. I never feel completely full after one.
5
The bagels here are amazing - freshly made and really tasty. One of my favourites is Piglet, but today I had a bagel sandwich called Salted which had beef brisket, gherkins, and melted cheese. Quite tasty. The place is clean, and staff are also nice and friendly
5
This is my go to place to grab lunch as its conveniently located below my office . The bagels here are freshly made and I love the lox that comes with salmon and cream cheese . The owners run this place and manage the lunch crowd perfectly! To add to this , they are also extremely warm and friendly :)
5
Was recommended by a Friend and have not look back since. This place reminds me of "black seed bagel" in NYC. Many choices and different favours of bagel to choose! Gourmet bagel! Have been back 4 time in the last 6 weeks! Will definitely be back again. Service are friendly!

There was a time when I loved bagels. I love it when the grilled surface is crispy yet inside is very chewy.I ordered two bagelwich (their sandwich made of bagels). One was very soft and the other was very hard. I could not see any consistency nor perfectly grilled bagel. However, the food was enjoyable with the fact that 1) it was made of a bagel and 2) the price was decent for its taste.The portion itself is not much either so it's perfect for a small bite or for a brunch
4
First off, I love the relaxed feel of the place. There was just the right amount of crowd - not too many that you're cramped, and not so little that you feel like you're the only one there. The decor is definitely hipster in design, and you have to prepare to share your table. I don't think the cafe allows reservations, and neither is there a need to since most people seem to drop by here for a quick bite and a coffee.The menu comprises bagels, true to its name. I ordered the HAM^2 bagelwich, which includes pulled pork rib, beets etc. I found the sandwich tasty - with the pulled pork being quite tender and savoury against the sweetness of the beets. With your bagelwich, you can also choose from a range of bagels, ranging from the savoury caramelised onion bagel to a cinnamon bagel. I added aioli sauce to my bagel and I loved it.My friends ordered the piglet and creamed tuna and they liked their bagelwiches too.Pricewise, most things are about $10, so it's quite affordable and fuss-free dining. My friends some dietary restraints, and it was all accommodated by the counter staff with no attitude. Quite appreciate that
5
My friend recommended this place to me and I must say I m impressed. I tried their steak bagel and it was so so yummy. But at the same time very big. By the time I finish half I am already so full but as it is so delicious I tried to finish all... Which make me too full after that.Highly recommended
