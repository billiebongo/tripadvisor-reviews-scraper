Super cheap eats and very beautiful plating. The sashimi were absolutely fresh. Hot food was innovative and interesting. We'll be back.

I ordered my set meal much earlier than my sister. But her meal came first. 15 mins later, my meal still hasn't arrived. Very disappointed in the service as i have queued up for 20 mins for a table. The food was not expensive. I love the unagi sushi and salmon sashimi - very fresh.When we paid for our bill, the manager kept apologising for the lateness of my meal. He even waivered off the unagi sushi. Good gesture on his part.Overall, i may come back again

It was a pleasant lunch. Atmosphere was pleasant, not quiet nor overtly noisy. Staff were friendly even though young. The 2 of us had eaten at their other outlets before and they have a corporate consistency throughout. This outlet was no different.Try their Salmon and Tuna Sashimi and the Chawanmushi, these will never fail you. The set lunches are reasonably priced, and portions fair. However, they fail on their fried offerings like crab and chicken as sometimes they come out soggy and drenched in oil. Not appetizing.Overall, decor, cleanliness and offerings are acceptable for a quick semi-self serve dining. They are quick and it doesn't smell. Comparable to Sushi Tei and better than Genki Sush
