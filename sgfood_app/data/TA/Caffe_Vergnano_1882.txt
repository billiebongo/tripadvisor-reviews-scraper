The place is beautiful but makes you feeling alone. Any we enjoyed our cofee, realy perfect. The service was good. The area around was desert.

If I’m in the area I always pass for a good espresso,as I’m Italian most of the time I don’t drink espresso cause most of the place serve no good.
Vergnano is amaz by coffe,clean place and good service for a reasonable price

If you love coffee, this little coffee shop serves some of the best espressos in town. The ambiance is lovely, with both indoor and outdoor tables. After a day of shopping, this is a beautiful, quiet refuge for a cup of great coffee any time.Skip the usual chain coffee shops and give Caffe Vergnano a try. You won't regret it

This place is good for a Saturday afternoon catch up session with friends. The venue is coffee casual, but not as casual as say, Starbucks.Had the cafe Americano, and it was super strong. They didn't add enough water for my taste; it was served in a small cup that would have been better for espresso. The caffeine content had me feeling jittery.Also ordered their salted caramel cake. It was fine, as sponge cakes go. Not terrible, but nothing to write home about either. Maybe the other cakes are better?The service was about what you would expect for Singapore -- efficient but impersonal, and all business as usual

Went for a quick bite on Sunday - just before the lunch crowd arrived.The premises are small, so if you go at busy times you will probably get a table outside (or have to stand and wait for one). Despite being "early", we waited 30 minutes for one breakfast order- poached eggs on avocado toast. But the other dish - bacon and eggs - didn't arrive. When we asked for it, after another 10 minutes were told there was a mix-up in the order and we'd have to wait 15 more minutes. We had to check out of our hotel so couldn't wait any more. Got some of our money back. (They kept the services charge!)Oh... and as other reviewers have commented, the coffees arrive lukewarm so there's no time to linger and enjoy them

Ordered Earl Grey Tea and Caramelised Bananas Waffle, water came luke warm for the tea. After 25 minutes wait for the a la minute waffle, it came cold as stone, it wasn't fluffy and the caramelised bananas are mixed with with unripe ones thus you can taste the bitterness....and to top it off...it was also COLD!!!! There is a saying to serve hot food hot and cold food cold... but this caffe simply don't get it! Never again to step into or recommend to others.

After a hard day's labour, enjoy a cup of aromatic coffee to relax or chill out. If you are looking for a cafe with cosy ambience and nice drinks, Caffe Vergnano will fit perfectly into the descriptions. This cafe was founded in 1882 and has opened its 100th store in Singapore in 2016.Do try out their beverages especially their signatures with prices ranging from $5 to $7:1) 1882 Affogato (vanilla ice-cream topped with expresso) allows you to control how much expresso to add;2) Choccolino is choccolate ice-cream and expresso mixed together for a richer version of Mocca;3) Delizioso is nutella latte available in hot or cold for those more adventurous;4) Nocciolino is choccolate hazelnut latte for the nutty lovers?5) Flat white for those who just want to play safe.If you want to have some bites, try out the cakes or ice-cream waffle topped with banana and chocolate/vanilla ice-cream.

Came back here for an early morning coffee during the week. The place has been open for around 6 months or so now and is becoming a lot more popular, but still no problem getting a table and service at 8am. Coffee was decent as per my previous visit. I expect to visit this place again in the not too distant future

Classic ambience with a variety of coffee with more specialty coffee than normal coffee cafe. Tried the bicerin which is a mixture of expresso and chocolate and highly recommended to chocolate lovers who want a touch of coffee. There is also another specialty of expresso with nutella which may be worth trying too. The place is also very cosy to meet up with friends for chit-chatting
