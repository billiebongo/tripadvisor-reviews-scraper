Weâ€™ve been eating here quite sometime. I really appreciate Thai food. Dishes at Kinmoo is not that authentic, but they put a modern twist onto their dishes which I really like. Will definitely eat again here.

The food is really good, but if you're a heavy eater the portions might leave you feeling slightly peckish! The service staff were a little be distracted or shorthanded, so we weren't given cutlery or the rice we ordered til we asked.

This review is getting a good rating.Love the mixed pork soup especially the meat balls which has a lot of bite. I can do away with the pork and would be perfect if it can be substituted with more meat balls. I prefer my soup to be boiling hot but it was lukewarm here. I also ordered the deep fried sweet intestine thinking it will be kind of sweet but it turned out to be rather salty. When I checked with the cashier, the sweet intestine actually refers to a certain part of the intestine

This cafe is located just opposite of bugis junction, so it is very easy to find. For those people who have craving for pratunam soi 19 wanton mee, this is one of the nearest version to it. They used the same concept whereby the bowl is big but the portion is little, of cos price is a bit more expensive than Thailand. Nevertheless the wanton mee is good, noodle is q and of cos the pork lard is in generous portion. We have ordered a Thai milk tea which compare to counterpart is not so sweet. Will definitely visit back this place whenever I having craving again

Maybe I had made the comparison with the real deal, but we were pretty glad they made the tweak to suit the local taste buds. However, they were thoughtful to provide the additional sauce options to enhance the taste closer to the authentic level."Moo" stands for Pork in Thai. And we were swarm with recommendation on the quality of their pork and almost every item the finger of the wait staff pointed to was a signature dish. ha....so eventually we settled for something that we preferred.The pork tasted fresh and good, but quantity was too little in the hot dishes. The Deep Fried Pork Belly was delicious and succulent. Could taste the difference that it's not frozen supplies and freshly purchased probably on the day of operation, which again was emphasized by the waitor. :D Only if they had removed the soft bones entirely, it would be flawless. A dish that is highly recommended."The Tom Yum is too spicy", that remark came from a person who has extremely high tolerance of spiciness. We were impressed by their level of flexibility to make alteration to dishes when we mentioned we could not take seafood and the Tom Yum Goong (seafood) was replaced with Pork ingredients.What many should observe is the Pork Hot Dishes such as Noodle Soup comes with liver and other entrails. If it could be mentioned/highlighted earlier or even better to provide a choice to replace with more strips of pork, it would be good, for not everyone takes entrails.In the end, we had only managed to locate 3-4 strips of pork in the bowl of Tom Yum. Rather disappointed I must say, for an establishment that's selling their Pork.Nevertheless, the meal was satisfying. Nothing too flambouyant, pricing was reasonable, staff was friendly and eager to please. We left happy.Overall, it is an above average joint. Will certainly return to try out the other dishes of theirs. Spotted quite a few interesting dishes that I would always order in Thailand but rarely seen done well everywhere else - such as, "Kai Jiao Moo Sup" (Fried Egg with Minced Pork".Anticipating to return...
