Nice food small portions. Quite authentic peranakan Flavours . Babi pong teh had far too much oil & fat. Good service
5
Most elegant way to enjoy Peranakan food I have ever experienced.
Professional staff, good service, the decoration of the place is very delicate, just as the food they served. Rich, tasteful. Very lovely restaurant.
4
Good ambience and service. Food was good but portions small. We loved the okra and the siege cake. Dessert portions were good sized.
5
Best satay ever. Loved it. Very very good food. Everything was amazing. I’d get very fat if I lived in Singapore the food is just incredible. The beef satay was the tastiest thing I’ve eaten. Actually everything was brilliant here.
5
Came here after waiting 3 weeks for a reservation and it was fab !!
Lovely starters: coronation chicken cups. Great mains : Fish head curry and Veggie niceness !
Beautiful decor and excellent service- what’s not to like ?!
5
Excellent service, superb food...nice desserts too...ordered assam fish, beef rendang and lor chye...
5
We visited here on Valentine’s Day. It was a pleasant surprise. The interior is on par, if not better than the design of PS cafe (I love PS cafe!). Service was excellent, the manager/staff demonstrated good menu knowledge, and did not try to oversell when recommending. Portion sizes were small, however filling. I enjoyed the Ikan Goreng Chilli the most. Will definitely come back again.
5
This was a repeat visit, but still just as enjoyable & exciting. Every dish is full of flavour & character, giving every mouthful an oomph ! Special thanks to the team of service staff who threw me a dessert cake surprise to make my birthday dinner even more memorable ! ^,
5
Heard many good things about this long established restaurant but never managed to get a table at the new national gallery, so tried the outlet at bk timah instead. Interior is beautiful, about like PS cafe. The buah keluak, beef rendang and dry laksa were super good. Price is very reasonable! Would go again
4
We decided to have dinner at the restaurant to check out some of the dishes as we were thinking of ordering their party trap for a friends' dinner at our home. The location is good and the interior decor of the restaurant is tastefully done. The service staff were very pleasant and helpful and offered good suggestions. We had a few of their popular dishes which turned out to be excellent. 4 of us shared a piece of the gula melaka rum cake which was really good. After this dinner we will be proceeding to order the party set for this Saturday dinner
3
Not many places serve peranakan so this establishment has built a reputation. Some interesting dishes but portions for the price are, in my opinion, too small. Mid-high dining prices but quality wise not commensurate.
5
Family-friendly dining location. Service staff are exceptionally attentive and good with food recommendations. Food is tasty, and food portions were just right. Gula melaka cake is also a must-try. Highly recommended.
4
Good peranakan. I spent a good moment with my wife. Nice spicy food, we enjoyed it.
I would recommend this restaurant
4
Nice ambience for a more classy dining. However, parking can be a challenge and price is definitely more expensive. Customer service is quite good and we love the beef rendang.
5
The ambience were good and the decoration of the restaurant represented a traditional peranakan house giving us a homely feel. Their beef rendang was fork tender and packed with flavours. Their other must try item is the dry laksa pasta which was done prefect!!
5
Everythings is so well liked. Hardly can find authentic nyona food in Singapore nowadays. Violet Oon really serve good food where my picky dad love the food too.
4
Decor was beautiful and elegant but ambience ruined when there are inconsiderate loud speaking customers. Beef rendang wad rrally lovely and tender but experience marred by the order of food which di not come together. They serve one dish at a time and you are left with no rice when the gravy dishes arrive. Food should be served together
4
Some friends living in Singapore suggested a dinner in this restaurant.It has been perfect from A to Z.Nice and very efficient service,wide offer of flavored dishes,with a great value for money.Interesting wine list.A real great address if you want to taste local food in a cosy atmosphere
5
This is my 3rd time here and the food and service continue to remain exceptional. My parents loved it so much after I brought them here for the first time that they come by themselves now. Make sure to safe space for dessert! You wonâ€™t regret i

This smallish restaurant tries to be dim lit and romantic, and with black painted walls, it may be rather depressing for some. The tables are placed quite close to each other, and you can hear loud conversations from other tables clearly. The Kim Chum Chye salad, whilst yummy, had fiery chilli padi in its sauce, and the spice level was beyond the tolerance of most everyone on our table. My husband turned red and was in tears for a long time! The Sayur Lodeh was delicious and fragrant, with crisp long beans. We were most disappointed with the Turmeric fried chicken - terrible thick dense batter and very salty blachan and onion dip. The Buah Keluak dishes were much enjoyed by those who had an acquired taste. I found it too strong, tart and overly concentrated and would have preferred the paste to be better balanced. The Laksa pasta and Beef rendang were consistently delicious! Among the desserts we ordered, one stood out above all the rest - the black glutinous rice with coconut ice cream
3
Most food items ordered were up to expectations or acceptable except the rebung masak lemak and nonya chap chye which were lacking in character and substance.
5
The array of spices has definitely wild our tastebuds, if you're looking for something exciting, look no further with Violet Oon!
4
I much prefer this outlet than the one at National Gallery. It's unassuming and a most lovely place for girlfriends to hang out and have awesome Peranakan food! Highly recommend!
5
Had a great dinner! Portion are reasonable and well taste! Very nice place for Oversea guests!! Friendly staff too!!
4
Nice ambience and authentic peranakan food. The new downtown line has made the journey very easy. The restaurant is kind enough to let us stay beyond the closing time. Kudos to the team! One small feedback. Might be good if can slow down the clearing of plates, especially when there are still food.
4
We ate here with our son who lives in Singapore. The quality of the food was excellent. Not cheap but it is in Singapore!However I was surprised to have a paper serviette, not a cotton linen one. The service was a bit erratic. The initial drinks seemed to take an age and all came at odd times. And we had to chase up our order for follow-up drinks. Plenty of waiters milling around so obviously not that well trained.All in all, a nice evening
4
The first impression of the restaurant is good. Lovely Peranakan tiles and chic decor gives the place a refreshing touch. However the place is very small and though there were only three groups totally 18 guests, the restaurant feels crowded and noisy. Hence, I hate to think what it would be like when it is full. The menu is small and has key Peranakan dishes. Some of the dishes are outstanding - beef rendang, sambal prawn, chilli fish, Ayam buah keluak. However, the ngoh Hiang is average and the tauhu goreng is seriously disappointing. The wine selection is limited and the biggest disappointment is dessert. If you are trying Peranakan food for the first time and needs to have a sense of what Peranakan dessert is, you are better off sampling it from bengawan solo, a bakery you find in any shopping center. The service and presentation is generous and hospitable and this is one reason why I will return and still highly recommend anyone who is after authentic Peranakan food in a nice setting. Violet Oonâ€™s restaurant is one of the better choices, if not the best. It is midrange - about 40-50SGD per head without wine. For a more Budget recommendation, read my other posts.
4
Local and fusion food presented with attentive service and amidst beautiful interiors that reflect a mix of Peranakan and western sensibilities. The dishes were generally decent but on the whole, not out of this world. The Udang Goreng Chilli was moderately spicy but otherwise unremarkable. For diners who want something mildly spicy, the cod in creamy laksa may be your dish but it was surprisingly underwhelming for us. The standout dishes however, were the Meatless Meatballs Rendang (unique and tasty) and the Bubur Cha Cha Pannacotta. Above all, I was impressed by the thoughtful efforts by the staff to make the dining experience special for the birthday diner
4
Violet Oon's kitchen at National Gallery was the perfect setting to celebrate Bryan's 25th birthday. My parents loved the Peranakan Colonial setting, the dishes and excellent service. The meat for every dish was very tender. We were especially impressed with Clover who was attentive to our needs and had manners that are commendable. Thank you Clover for making Bryan/s birthday a memorable occasion. We love the complimentary dessert and instant family photo attached to 'Violet Oon's photo frame. From Bryan Estelle and Anthon
5
Our local friends treated us to this wonderful place and we had a very memorable night. Under the care of Violet herself, who we adored meeting, we sampled the most amazing Paranakan dishes, each with distinctive flavors and many reflecting long hours of work. The service and setting are splendid, Parisian in many ways, and the wine list just grand. This is a fine place for hours with good friends and we will return when back in town
5
After twenty eight days on the road the names of dishes have faded, but they were fantastic. Lovely interior and one very knowledgable, helpful and adorable waiter Roall? Anyway the best meal in a month long trip to S'pore, Thailand and Cambodia.
4
Good Peranankan food, but pricey. You pay for the service and the ambience though. I would recommend the dry laksa for people who find laksa to be too rich. And the beef rendang is yum!
5
Had a wonderful time there last Friday. Celebrated my BFF, Ginger's birthday. Just casually mentioned to Don that it was her birthday and ended up with a small cake and candle for her and on top of that we have a wonderful surprise - a photo to keep for our time there! It was a wonderful memories. And the service staff there was fantastic especailly Don! Always cheerful and helpful. Will be going back there again provided the bookings are available. Had a hard time booking at all he three restaurants. Visited the one at Clarke Quay. But preferred the service staff at Bukit Timah. Don - thank you for making our evening a special and wonderful evening. THANK YOU!
5
Violet Oon is well know nd respected and now i know why.Great ambianceGreat serviceGREAT foodIf you want to intersect with the culture of this region in a very sophisticated way, this is an elegant way to do it. Surprisingly good prices for the quality
5
A little bit off the beaten tourist track but really nice with expats and locals. The food was delicious. The Beef Rendang was tender and my chilli prawns were like prawns with chilli veg (quite spicy though). The service was excellent and very willing to help with the different choices of food.
4
During my visit, found that this was quite a family friendly place. Dishes were not bad. I enjoyed the dry mee siam and the assam fish in particular. My mother felt that the portion for the Tahu goreng could be more generous. Desserts were generally quite good as well. We enjoyed the cakes and the pulot hitam.
4
Parking can be challenging... so be prepared to park further in the estate.Food was great as usual ... oddly enuf the place was not as crowded as usual for Friday night with several empty tablesWe did get a snobby waitress who clearly thot we were under ordering but we unfortunately weren't to hungry..
5
Went to this restaurant for lunch recently with 2 friends. Ordered otak, dry laksa, chilli prawn and ngoh hiang. A great restaurant that I wanted to try for a long time and glad that we make it this time. The place also serve brunch with good choice selection. Service was really good!BRTon
4
Our starters, Ngoh Hiang and coronation chicken were to die for, so flavoursome. The mains, Aunty Nanni's beef cheek and sambas udang prawns didn't disappoint. A gem of a restaurant found in suburbia. Very warm and attentive hospitality. My friend and I were celebrating my birthday, once they realised it was my birthday they brought out dessert with a candle and took a photo. Yummy traditional dessert, Kueh beng kah Surprisingly as we left they had already developed the photo and gave it to me in cardboard framing as a memento. Lovely evening, with intensively flavoured food, great service and devour reflective of the culture
2
I have been here yesterday evening with a group of about 40 people. Most of us were accommodated in a single, long table that had to contain no more than 2/3 of the people that were sit there. Our chairs were physically one attached to the other, all were touching the arms of the person on the right and on the left, and is was almost impossible to eat in a decent way without risking to create troubles to the friend close to you and to you. About 40 cm space per person is ridiculous and not acceptable in an expensive place like this. Wine arrived when we were in the middle of the main dish. Food was good but for sure not unforgettable. In synthesis, negative
5
Loved the ambience and service and of course the food was to die for! Everyone from my kids to my Dad all loved the food. My Dad said the food was really authentic and reminded him of the meals my grandmother used to cook!
4
Quaint little nyonya restaurant that serve fine nyonya traditional Peranakan cuisine. Their buah keluak chicken generously come with three nuts & their ngoh niang is the best I've ever had so far. All their food are elegantly presented & service is good.
4
Even though the food was on the pricy size, their service was exceptional! Loved the ambiance & service staff.
4
Love the deco of the place and the food was really good. Abit of the expensive side though... Really friendly staff too!
4
Overall, the service was impeccable (really attentive), the decor really modern yet contains the essence of a traditional peranakan house, and the food is good. The Ayam Bakuala was at best average as the chicken (though they gave us 2 drumsticks & 1 thigh piece). The chicken was a little dry and tough, but the nuts made up for it's lacking in terms of being really big, stuffed to the brim and flavourful. The sayur lodeh was really good with very flavourful broth, i only wished there were more cabbage and long beans though. The dish that won the night was the Babi Pon Tay. Huge square chunks of pork belly, braised to perfection. it was so tender and the meat just melts in your mouth! For dessert we had pulut hitam. Traditionally, it is served with coconut milk, but in VO, they served it with coconut ice cream!! Yummy! As it was my Fiance's birthday, they even gave us a sugee cake (tapioca cake) and it was indeed delish! We were so full, we could hardly stand straight.
4
At this restaurant, one gets the flavor of a well blended spice experience. None of the sauces are watered down versions and most are authentic as I far as I can remember when my peranakan grandma used to cook. Kudos to the chef for keeping this time consuming cuisine alive! Only bugbear I had was that one side of the room had condensation on the tables and cutlery (sole reason for not giving it the 5 star) ! Hopefully the management will solve this issue soon
4
This is an elegant, small n cosy restaurant with polite and well trained serving stewards. The service was attentive, knowledgeable and good. And the food is most authentic and delicious! We were all very impressed with the chef's cooking. We ordered many dishes and most were of an extremely high culinary standard. We enjoyed especially their Rendang, beef cheeks, ladies fingers, dry Laksa. The Kim Chum Chye Salad was spicy but so delicious, with crispy tasty star fruit! We also ordered fried prawns with chilli, Chap Chye, braised Pork and sambal terong. Desserts: Gula Melaka cake tasted like Malaiko , pannacotta was silky smooth n very yummy, the kueh bengka was a large slice, very moist, and with low sugar. We did not like the chendol tea as it had a nasty stale coconut smell.
5
The service is excellent! We ordered the beef cheek and we commented to the manager that it was too tough and not the usual standard. We already ate 1/4 of it. He surprised us by not only changing a new plate of beef cheek but also did not charge us for the beef ! The rest of the service staffs r prompt and friendl
5
We ate at 2 of her restaurants( National Gallery and Bukh Timah) during our 1 week stay in Singapore. So delicious!!! Excellent service, beautiful ambience, delicious food!!! We had Chicken curry, Beef Randang, Nassi Kunning( coconut rice), Ikan Goreng chili ( fried red snapper), Haienese chicken rice, coconut panbacotta and Gula Melaka cake. All are delicious!!! Make sure to call for a reservation
3
Food portion was quite small for its price, ordered a variety of dishes, all were okay except for the babi assam. It seemed like they threw in the pork belly at last minute, the pork didn't get to absorb the sauce. Dessert was really nice, loved the gula melaka cake and the lemon pie.Loved the service, they kept refilling the water and cleared out plates immediately once we were done with it.It's a small restaurant, so seating could get limited at peak hours (unless you don't mind seating outside)Overall, food was okay, but there are other better peranakan food
5
Great Peranakan food! Environment was wonderful! Love the buah keluak! Very hard to find this nowadays.
5
We were there to celebrate my husband's birthday with some friends. The food was delicious (to say the least), on the spicy side, however, there are several non-spicy dishes as well. The staff was surprisingly nice, friendly & knowledgeable. I would highly recommend this place!
3
Very good Peranakan food with good value and excellent service. Our only compliant is that the restaurant is too small, crowded and noisy to enjoy a pleasant dining experience with friends.
5
The staff were extremely friendly and attentive. A complimentary dessert was also provided for my husband's birthday which was a lovely surprise.
4
Ambience was interesting with many historical pictures and memorabilia displayed. Service was acceptable and wait-staff were knowledgeable and quite professional in presentation. It was quite crowded - you have to make reservations and adhere to time slots. As it is in a residential area, parking can be a little challenging, if you drive
5
The moment we stepped up to the maÃ®tre d' outside the door of the restaurant, we knew we would have a wonderful dining experience. We were greeted warmly. Every contact with a waiter or service person felt as if we had been dining here forever and were favorite customers. The decor literally sparkles, with glazed tiles in authentic Peranakan design. We asked the waiter for a recommendation and were deighted with the two dishes and a side that he suggested. This was one of the best meals we have had in Singapore.The restaurant is sequestered behind shrubs just off Bukit Timah Road. Make sure you know the address. If you see a seafood restaurant with outdoor seating, you are next door to Violet Oon. You should be able to spot the Violet Oon sign above the shrubs. Try this restaurant if you want to sample wonderful Peranakan cuisine
1
our reservation was at 8.45. We ordered and starters came very quick. We asked to wait with the main for a while, because we wanted to enjoy our conversation and food at ease. The main courses came way to quick. When we started to eat the main, they told us that we had to order our deserts. After ordering our desserts they asked if we wanted another bottle of wine. We said no, because we had to rush eating our food. The whole evening they gave us the feeling we had to rush, because they gave us the feeling they wanted to close the restaurant early.The food was ok. Nothing special. Taste was flat. Rendang was really bad. We couldn't cut the meat because there was too much fat and not cooked long enough.It was a pity, we had dinner before at the same place, but will not go again.The next day we went to another restaurant with same kind of food and it was soooo much better
3
Place is warm as one of their aircon is spoilt. Some of the dish are a little too salty or sweet and I'm actually expecting a lot more from this restaurant especially after reading so many good reviews about them.However, I have to say that the staff there made the experience a little better.
3
The waiters are well trained to get customer to spend extra. They waiter topping up water to my kids even we said we have enough. We, a family of 2 adults and 2 kids, ended up paying $18++ for 3 bottles of water. That's all the impression on "food" I've with this restaurant.
5
I tried blue ginger in Singapore before, and I prefer here over blue ginger. As someone who is familiar with blue Malay and Chinese foods, I find the food over here is original however more creativity and refined in ingredients selection. Good serving is decent as well, I don't mind visiting here again.
5
Beautiful interior, gracious service and spectacular food. Beef rendang, butter prawn pineapple cake are all winners! Heartily recommended.
4
Went there with a friend. Food was very tasty and delicious. Service was good too. However cost was quite pricey at $135 for two pax.
4
Beef rendang was good
Kueh pie tee normal
Soup was okay
Didn't really like the sambal egg plant
The but bur cha cha panacotta was good
5
First time diner and was very impressed with the helpful and knowledgeable staff. The food was excellent. We started with a delicious Gado Gado with a perfect not too spicey peanut sauce. We then shared Ngoh Hiang which came with a lovely sweet sauce and Buah Keluak noodle which is a dry noodle in a spicey dry sauce. All absolutely delicious and we will be back. Not too expensive either ar $84 for 2 with soft drinks.
4
I was there with my sister recently who insisted that I had to try some of the signature dishes. It was my first time as I had resisted the urge to patronize the place after hearing comments that the place was all fluff without any substance. Well, I am glad to report that the comments were wrong.We were not very hungry and so shared several items - the top hats (pie tee), the dry laksa and the kiam chye pork soup. We then finished off by sharing a bee koh moy (glutinous rice with coconut ice cream on top). Everything was tasty and service was fast - this could be because we went in without a booking and they needed to have the table back by a certain time! I will definitely go again and try more of the fare they have. There were lots of people and buzz on a Friday evening
5
My family was there to celebrate my Mom's birthday and the overall experience was amazing - great food and wonderful service. Must tries would be the Laksa Sauce Cod, Dry Laksa, Gula Melaka with Coconut Ice-cream, the Gula Melaka and Sugee Cakes. The staff were so thoughtful to even bless my Mom with a slice of cake for her birthday. Am heading back again this weekend
5
The restaurant encountered some pretty last min aircon break down and they were kind enough to keep us informed. However, we went ahead with our reservations. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. My client who joined us for dinner was impressed with the decor and experience with Violet Oon's :
5
Brought my Peranakan friends to dine at Violet Oon, and all gave a double thumbs up in approval! Excellent food and service as always! Some of the menu items are on the pricey side, but such a good quality of food is sometimes worth the splurge.
5
Dinner with friends from out of town. Service was very good, friendly and helpful. The food was delicious. We liked the beef cheeks in particular. I was really interested to try a fancy version of peranakan food and this restaurant did not fail to deliver. A nice fit out too. Very much enjoyed the experience
3
Ambience was generally nice. Food was average. Ordered the ayam buah keluak, sayur loodeh, fried fish with chili and dry mee siam. Only the fried fish is good. For dessert, we had the sugee cake which was tasty. Service was ok in the restaurant but no one picked up the phone when I tried calling to change the reservation timing.
4
Food and service was excellent. However is price is steep. When we were there, we managed to catch the chef preparing the peranakan pancake
4
Had a good time at VO. Food was great - the beef rendang reminded me of my mum's beef rendang.... Food was good and slightly unusual - especially the cold ladies finger dish..... fantastic time
5
I went to and very much enjoyed their sister restaurant in the National Gallery Singapore, but was looking for something a bit quieter so decided to try this sister restaurant instead. Great dishes at a reasonable price. Polished, professional service. Well managed overall.
4
Food was mediocre, and Bukit Timah restaurant was very noisy we almost had to shout to hear one another. But service was excellent.
4
Tried to book at the national gallery but it was full. The bukit timah branch is quite out of the way, but the food was good, as expected. The reason I can't give five stars is because they forgot our beef rendang order, although they rectified this immediately when we reminded them
4
Have had a chance to enjoy catering from Violet Oon a few months back and then tried to see if we could try out their restaurants. The ambiance and furnishing are very classy and has the semblance of some French mixed with Peranakan decor. Service was excellent but Chris and Selvaraj (hope I got their names right) and they were very helpful. Food wise, for so many years having tasted the original Violet Oon, the beef in the Beef Rendang is still soft and gravy very tasty and Ngor Hiang put together with loads of fresh chestnuts. HOWEVER, I found the taste now sweeter and not as spicy as before, perhaps to cater to the more Caucasian clients but I do miss the spicier VO. Overall it was a pleasant experience and I enjoyed the lunch with the setting and service.You can taste the fresh ingredients used and you do pay for what you get. Keep it up! IMPT Do make reservations ahead of time for both restaurant and catering
5
Violet Oon at Bukit Timah is a small and charming restaurant serving traditional Perakanan dishes. Although we did not have a reservation and this you should ensure you make ahead of time, the Maitre D accommodated us. We ordered Gado gado, fried fish curry and chicken curry. For dessert try the Gula Melaka cake that is served warm. 1 portion shared is plenty! Delicious! On the minus side, the dining experience was ruined when a loud Ang Mo woman arrived with her party of diners
4
When visiting family in Singapore I always stop into Violet Oons. For starter I got the Ngoh Hiang. Minced crab meat, prawn and pork in a bean curd skin deep fried. Very tasty, especially with the sambaal. The beef rending is lovely, with the taste of the kaffir lime coming through really well. The deep fried red snapper was outstanding, and the use of traditional style recipe and accompaniments worked really well.As a group we tried all the deserts and they were all exemplary.Highly recommended
3
Had High Tea and Dinner at the restaurant in National Gallery and was surprised at how efficient their service are. 1 day prior to your arrival, the reservations staff (Ms Seri) wil reconfirm and remind you of your reservation. A very pleasant and sweet lady compared to the previous reservation girl (if i remember correctly is Lynete). Overall, food was good
5
I recommend Violet Onn Singapore at Bukit Timah highly. I hosted a visitor from Japan and wanted him to experience Peranakan food in a classy setting.You are first greeted with the Peranakan décor; literally from floor to ceiling: they lined their walls and ceilings with different Peranakan tiles. There’s a hint of art décor with black accents and mirrors, and quilted seatings along the wall. The plates are personalized with the VO signature logo to complete the touch of elegance.This branch is amongst the Bukit Timah residential neighbourhood and hence very cosy. The service is equally homey from the moment I was greeted. When I was waiting a while for my guests to arrive, they kept coming around to make sure my beverage is fine and if I needed something else.We started with their meat packed ngoh hiang rolls. The tasty kuay pie tee gave me the chance to explain to my visitor about our family parties where we fill our own pie tee’s and roll our popiah’s.The beef rendang was tender and the buah keluak chicken came with little spoons to savour the olive-tasting fruit. My Japanese friend said the chap chye reminded him of a similar vegetable dish cooked at home. He was also thrilled with roti jalah which he used to soak the gravy from the dishes.We wanted to introduce my guest to chendol but they don’t serve it. But the moist gula melaka cake more than made up for it. The pièce de résistance of the meal was the bubur cha cha pannacotta. My friend kept talking about it days after. I do wonder if it was better served the original way: turned out from the glass tumbler; with the bubur cha cha trimmings poured over it.Whilst the location suits a family outing, there was a long table of corporate diners that night. The menu is long and varied for a large group; and great for overseas guests. They also serve dry laksa and beehoon and even one with buak keluak. They are ample seafood and vegetarian dishes. The posh looking décor didn’t come with a posh price : 
4
Formal but comfortable atmosphere. Service was excellent and food very traditional. If you go you must try the tapioca cake with coconut milk sauce (kueh beng kah). It is incredible.
5
Food is delicious and sophisticated ambience will make you comfortable and amaze you with attentive service.
5
The ambiance and setting are quite delightful.
We love the food and the staff are beyond helpful.
Try the Gula Malaka cake dessert it's divine
4
Standard of food was matched by the charming service of the wait staff. Restaurant manager deserves special mention.
4
Some good peranakan dishes. It is my second time there and I will come back again after trying other peranakan restaurants in SGP.
5
The food was excellent but it would have been nice to have some more vegetarian and vegan options. The service was a little slow at times but it was busy.
5
Have heard and read a lot of good reviews about this restaurant so decided to go for brunch to celebrate my son's birthday. We like the decoration, it is very pleasant and not overdoing. Staff were genuinely friendly and helpful. The food was very good, especially the beef rendang, chilli prawns and ngo hian. We will definitely be back for more
2
The place is pretty and conveniently located at the top of a lively road with many shops and restaurants (also close to a taxi stand). Nothing to say about the service and the quality of the food (some dishes better than others), but I do have an observation: red wine shouldn't be served chilled!
4
Overall the food was a little on the salty side. Then again it is Perenakan. The beef rendang is the best I have eaten so far. It is so soft and flavourful. Pair it with rice or the dry laksa. The service was great except for one wait staff who had too much nicotine smell in his mouth.
5
The service was excellent. Must book in advance. You can try your luck by walking in. We have Assam fish (sour spicy ), chap chye (stir fry mixed vegetables), Babi ponteh (spice stew pork) and ngoh hiang (fried meat roll with 5-spice powder). The portion were right enough for 3 of us. The price was on a higher side though
4
The service is good, food is good, cozy setting which is great for small gathering as the size of that outlet is not big.
Customer setvice staffs are friendly and helpful.
4
Our family of 7 went to this restaurant for a belated Mother's Day dinner. We ordered nine different dishes. Our highest vote went to beef rendang. Other dishes we liked were tumeric chicken wings, dry laksa, and buah keluak ayam. Good service and cosy ambience.
3
Not too bad but a little pricey. Some dishes like the chap chye miss authentic peranakan ingredients.
5
This is definitely a must try for peranankan food lovers. Only downside is that the dessert is way too exp for its portion.
5
Great pernakan food - the beef cheeks were great - not to mention the Gula Melaka cake. We also had the puller pork Violet Roti which was sinfully tasty!4 stars on the food - and the friendly and warm service upgrades it to a 5 for m
4
Had a most pleasant dining experience at Violet Oon. Cosy ambience, tasteful and classy interior decor, good service, and excellent food. The Buah Keluak Ayam (Chicken) - a Peranakan specialty - was done perfectly. The sambal of the Sambal Petai with Prawns left me with a longing even the next day. The Nasi Kunning is wonderfully flavourful on its own, with the spice from the tumeric and the fragrance from the coconut milk
3
Did not have a good meal here despite the other reviews. Service was plesant but a littel rushed the first appetize with shrimp and pork in some brown sauce tasted, well tasteless. The laksa noodle soup was better but not even third best that I had... Place was small and noisy. With her old place was open
5
Finally we got a table for this popular eatery this weekend! Fully booked, as it was last Mother's Day Weekend, we turned up now to understand just why!? Unique Singaporean cuisine of a kind I've never tasted before, I could see the roots of it as Malay, Indian & Chinese in a truly unique blend, served with a smile! The dishes we tried were Sambal Eggplant, Meatless meatballs, Roti Jala, Noodles, Rice and the Chef's own spicy potato! For drinks it was Kiwi Pineapple Smoothie, Ginger Beer & Iced Tea. Truly mouthwatering stuff which tickled our taste buds to the core! A definite "must re-visit" place for sure

Had dinner there while staying close by, we didn't have booking but they told us to come back in 20 minutes for second sitting, the Restaurant is not that big but was certainly full, The Satays were divine we also had a Dry Curry Laska and enjoyed immensely would have scored higher but was a little disappointed with the Singapore Sling we have had about 5 this week in town and all have been a bit different, the service was excellent and overall price for food was great and would certainly visit agai

Celebrated mother's day and we ordered ngoh hiang, buah keluah ayam, pork belly, dry laksa and veg curry with tanpeh. I enjoyed all the food especially the ayam. The dry laksa tasted slightly salty. Waiters take good care of us which make overall experience truly enjoyable!
5
The staffs are extremely friendly and the food is fantastic. Celebrated my birthday there and the staff actually give a free small cake to us.
3
Between blue ginger and violet oon, violet oon is a little too expensive for the above average food. Staffs arrive were excellent.
5
This is a great restaurant, with delicious Peranakan food. The decor is lovely with dark wood and traditional Peranakan tiles. The service is good, attentive and professional. The Peranakan food is tasty, a little spicy (but just enough) and varied and the flavours are delicious. Do try the beef redang and for starters the Ngoh Hiang and the Kuay Pie Tee, they are out of this world.
5
Had a celebratory lunch at Violet Oon with special friends and guests from Nepal. It was their first time trying peranakan food and the experience was truly one to remember. Each dish was so exquisitely prepared with fresh ingredients.The service staff took the effort to explain the flavors in each dish to our guests. I truly appreciated the professionalism of the staff and the conscientiousness that each of them displayed. Highly recommend the dry laksa and the kueh pie-ti! Thank you Violet Oon team for presenting such a magical experience - for our bellies and for our senses. Having another craving for Violet Oon as I write this.

I live in the area and visit this restaurant every few months. It has as a lovely ambiance and is clearly more upmarket than most Perarakan restaurants. But food, which pretty expensive are served in tiny portions! 1 main was barely enough for 2 people. Also, whilst the Chicken curry was good but we had barely any curry sauce and the Beef Rendang was so chewy and sinewy and we couldn't eat it at all- even though the sauce was yummy. Really a shame
4
We were invited to Violet Oon in the National Gallery during our short visit in Singapore before trip to South Africa. We really looked forward to have some spicy and tasty local food. Food was of high standard and love the boutique feel of the restaurant -- stylishly furnished and intimate. Would have given a higher rating if one of the beef dish wasn't tough!
4
Okay, so I have to watch that I am not becoming a classic Singapore whiner, because it is a very good restaurant. But as has been remarked, even by Singapore standards, this is expensive, and it is a fancy if Bistro-ish place. For that, the setting and ambiance is not as five-star as it should be, I think. All is very good, not that much is really excellent. Porcelain, cutlery, napkins, glasses... there is a definite "meh" here. And the same, in the end, goes for the food, which is very good, but there are just excellent nyonya places at half the price (not less!) around. The wine was quite bad. And for the atmosphere, the National Gallery branch is just, I think, much better. I do think, however, that their Babi Assam is a really excellent dish
3
We had been looking forward to Violet Oon's cuisine and sadly couldn't get into either of the established venues at The National or Bukit Timah. We were offered the newer Satay Bar & Grill at Clarke Quay. Lovely interior with a mix of high and low tables. We had a delightful meal with delicious food -Sate was plentiful and delicious and Baramundi was divine! Buah Keluak Ayam was truly different and great to try something so unusual. Service, however, was rather over attentive and the courses rushed, which was a shame. As per a lot of Singapore it's not a cheap evening, but we felt it was justified to a point:The whole evening was then marred, however, by the fact you have to use public toilets in the nearby Clarke Quay! So you spend close on Â£175 for dinner for two (bottle of wine and 2 cocktails) and then have to walk about 300yards on a side road/walkway to a public (dirty and disgusting at 10pm) toilet! Really!! No! This even shocked my husband ...Enough to say this needs to be sorted or else eat somewhere else. We won't return sadly nor recommend it to anyone ... so many more great choices in Singapore. Previous reviewers have also commented on this so take note - it's not a fast food restaurant in a food court so sort it out!! At the very least warn diners before arrival so they can make an informed decision
5
What a great welcome we received and what great service continued during our dinner.The Peranakan food is different and surprisingly good.Delicious appetisers of prawn and pork wrapped in bean curd and pastry cups with turnip filling were followed by flawless pork and clever ladies fingers with sambal.Very reasonable cold Tuscan rose went well with food.We finished with an indulgent but light gula melaka cake.The staff must be the friendliest yet most professional in Singapore with the tall smiling boss totally in charge of a packed happy restaurant. If you are visiting Singapore for the first time make a beeline for Violet Oon. Great value and great food served by special people
5
Great food with excellent service! Was greeted with very good service right from the point I stepped into the restaurant. They took the effort to remember the details for sure (eg. They remembered who on the table is having warm or ice water). They are very prompt and attentive. Really impressed with the service and experience.The food were presented very nicely with great flavours and taste. Ingredients were fresh to add to the list. This place is great for ambience, food, service and experience. If you're driving there, just be prepared for some risk involved for illegal parking. I really enjoyed the meal and highly recommended for locals and tourists! There's an outlet at National Gallery which is more accessible.Great Job, Violet Oon Team
4
A busy and quite noisy environment in the middle of the National Gallery, this place serves authentic flavours and ingredients. Service was a bit patchy.
3
The place is located nicely in the National Gallery and the view is nice towards Marina Bay.
The food is good as well but it just doesnt qualify for very good..
Still go there but don't expect the evening of your life
5
I feel that the food really lived up to its reputation. It was so authentic and the staff were really helpful in recommending dishes to us! Prices were affordable and I would definitely go back again!
5
Love the food at Violet Oon! The staff were also very helpful, thorough, and friendly. Excellent dinner!
5
Delicious food with excellent service. If you are a local kopi kind of drinker, the kopi here is a must try (we couldn't help but order a second!)
5
Service was attentive but unobtrusive. Food came quickly and all at the same time. For Starters we had Ngoh Huang - very good; Coronation Chicken - exquisite; Turmeric Chicken wings - good. Our main courses were plentiful and outstanding. From the Dry Laksa, Beef Rendang, Sambal Udang, Babi Pong Tai, the dishes were faultless. Special mention of the Chicken Curry, it may sound boring and something quickly skipped over when perusing the menu, but do so at your peril. It was fantastic and, importantly for those who cannot take much chilli- like my children, mild.All in all very memorable and worth the trip out toward Bukit Timah
5
Had a lovely dinner again at Violet Onn, Bukit Timah. It was a busy night at the restaurant but the staffs were in good spirit and friendly. Every dish was good. We decided to try the beef cheek and it was delicious! We will definitely be back.
4
Atmosphere here is wonderful, feels like the old Singapore. The good is delicious and their signature dishes are well chosen and delicious. They did try to charge us for 2 bottles instead of 2 glasses of wine, but I put that to be a honest mistake, but check the bill closely anyway. I'd go bac
4
Second time back and loved it. Highlight was BUAH KELUAK AYAM which features the candle nut. This nut starts off white in the wild. It is shunned by monkeys due to the cyanide. Subsequent preparation sees it boiled black over 48 hours to be rendered safe for consumption. The kernel is mashed and re packed into the nut. Delicious flavor which goes so well with the beautifully prepared chicken. Meatless meatballs and roti jala topped off a wonderful occasion. Take to trip to the real Singapore up Bukka Timah road
5
Went here for lunch as saw it reviewed on Adam Laws " Taste of Singapore" SBS.Had a wonderful lunch of Malay food. Restaurant is small, intimate and authentically decorated. We went to the original one in Bukit Timah Rd which is a 10 min taxi ride from our Orchard Rd hotel. Food was wonderful, does have some spice so beware if not into chili. We went for the classic signature dishes which were so flavoursome. Our two male waiters were fantastic, so helpful, attentive, friendly and funny. Loved you boys !!And yes as in another review the Kopi was delicious ( it looks strong and I don't like strong coffee but I tasted hubby's and loved it). Would definitely return when next in Singer's
4
Had some starters (the one with prawns was amazing) and the dry laksa. The laksa wasn't too spicy and very nice.
Good recommendation!
4
Traditional peranakan food which was perfectly spiced and cooked. Restaurant is also very beautiful inside. Worth visiting if you want something different and want to try something different
5
Definitely a must visit for lovers of Peranakan food. Try their special black fruit pasta!
Ambience was good too!!
3
There's nothing wrong with the food, but the taste was just too average. I was expecting those local dishes to be more upscale, but no. Rather, you will get this "atas" feel you are craving for from the restaurant vibe. With the average taste of food, I can say its really overpriced. Easily spent $120 for 3 dishes and 2 wines. Maybe if you give generous portions,it can be okay. Even my prosecco, which was served on a flute glass, was filled 1/4 of the glass (as if its a red wine, yep...how can it be acceptable) and its $18++ for that, mind you. The service is great! Although sometimes I feel our server is "too much"
3
Only open 5 days, this branch of Violet Oon's did okay with service and food quality. Much like the other branches, pricing was a bit exaggerated ($17 for THREE sticks of beef satay? It was good, but it didn't need to be that expensive.) The worst part of the meal came at the end though when my guests needed to use the bathroom and we discovered that the large restaurant doesn't have its own facilities. Instead, you need to exit the restaurant and walk to the public toilets (where there are only three stalls for ladies) that serve all of Clarke Quay. Waiting in a public line for a bathroom when you're eating at a restaurant that has $50 entrees is just thoughtless customer service
5
This is one of our favourite dining experiences for Peranakan food. The end to end dining experience is great; from the way the place is meticulously designed, to the service attention and the good food! Particularly great to catch up with friends and family over a long lunch. The kuih pie tee is recommended, alongside the Ayam buah Keluak, rendang; for desserts best to try a few to taste and get the variety. For those who remember Violet, from over the years as a iconic Chef, you can also catch her at the restaurant from time to time. Highly recommended!
1
Booked a table for two. We ordered Rendang, Pong tay, Ngoh Hiang, 2 Jasmine rice and paired with glasses of wine. Expensive side but taste-wise, not so good. We only liked the Ngoh Hiang. Okay to try once but I think this restaurant is overrated. Baba Chews Bar & Eatery at Hotel Indigo and Chilli Padi at NUS tasted much better.
1
We had great expectation going to violet oon since we heard reservation queue is pretty Long. It's suppose to be one of the best Peranakan restaurant in town. To our dismal, the price on the menu is Super expensive, portion is very small and the taste is no where near Peranakan style. Taste is terrible. Not recommended at all. Better go to Keppel club and dine there. Cost is at least 1/2 and food portion is bigger and taste is quite authenti
5
Just the sound of the Buah Keluak Pasta had captured my attention. A beautiful fusion between east and west, this beauty is what happens when you combine classic Nonya spice with AlDente spaghetti noodle! Traditional Buah Keluak is probably a bit of an acquired taste though! Not for the faintest of hearts! Though the little Peranakan in me enjoyed this! I also wanted to give the Ngoh Hiang a try since it seemed like every table was ordering it.. And it's not hard to see why. This was easily the best ngoh hiong I've had in Singapore
5
I have to admit, i have never really eaten Malaysian food much less Nyonya cuisine. Similar to Indonesian food but much better. The variety of dishes that I had were all very tasty and beautifully presented and a good selection of wines. Next time I am back in Singapore i will re-visit this restaurant and try more of its food. The service staff was excellent. At the end of your meal, be sure to have the Burbur Cha Cha Pannacotta - a wonderful light and tasty dessert (be sure to mix it up before you eat it)
5
The best thing of this restaurant was service. Staff were really kind. Foods are also wonderful! You must try curry chicken and gula malaka cake.
3
Good food, tasty, spicy, flavorful peranakan food, but overpriced. Does not feel satisfying and loss the homely feel of peranakan food. The dessert was too rich and sweet.
5
Lovely atmosphere and superb food. Friendly staff and easy to make reservation. Ask waiter for his recommendations to the best dishes.
4
The decor and service from the staff was exceptional. Food portion size was rather confusing. However, the staff was attentive enough to give us advice on the matter.
4
Food was very flavourful and service staff were very attentive. However, prices are quite steep for local fare.
5
Food was really tasty and each dishes had its very distinct and specific set of spices. We have rarely tasted such a good peranakan cuisine. Service was friendly and the waiter advises were pertinent. Bravo
4
Nice decor and lovely restaurant, service was quite good as well. Decent peranakan fare, reminded boyfriend of his grandmother's cooking
3
Food was decent and the ambience was nice but i cant feeling that the spiciness of the dishes has been toned down. The beef rendang was very tender but didnt wow me. Ngoh hiang and kueh pie tee was nice but again lacking sthg... desserts was the saving grace. We had the black glutinous rice with coconut ice cream and the gula melaka cake. Both had just the right amount of sweetness and was a perfect ending to the meal. The meal would have been better if there wasnt a housefly buzzing around..
4
Went here with my mother and was not disappointed. It's a small restaurant in the national gallery (used to be the parliamentbuilding) but it is nicely decorated and have a good selection of food. The service was friendly but slightly fawlty towersesque. The waiter came with the wrong dishes to us, and also to the couple next to us, so make sure to remember what you ordered.
3
Had a family dinner at Bukit Timah outlet. Nice ambience and great service level. However, dishes ordered - Goh Hiang, lemongrass chicken wings and bendi lack lustre. The assam fish with mackeral fish was fishy in taste and the strong assam sauce did not eliminate the fishy smell. Probably another firm fleshed fish would be a better choice.
4
The menu is rather extensive with both traditional and modern interpretations of Peranakan cuisine. The food served was very tasty and to our expectations, and the staff were extremely attentive and polite.
5
We've been to Violet Oon's every few months for the past year and have never had a bad meal. Quality, flavours, service are always superb.
5
This was fine dining traditional food at its best. Nice decor atmosphere and the service could not be faulted. Then the food...yum yum yum. Absolutely delicious. Thank you violet oon
4
The food at Violet Oon are well executed, authentic Peranakan fare. Eating here always brings back memories of childhood and my Nyonya grandmother's cooking. Service here is friendly and attentive too. My only gripe is that the food is a tad salty for my tastebuds.
5
My family had dinner here to celebrate my father's 80th birthday. The food was authentic and delicious, and the service attentive and professional. My only suggestion is to offer two serving sizes for the sharing dishes, to cater to groups of varying sizes.
5
It was my first time visiting Violet Oon's and we had a great time. Definitely will come back again.
5
It was a great introduction to peranakan food for our overseas guests, they absolutely loved it. The ambience was wonderful as well and the severs were very helpful with their dish recommendactions.
4
Nice atmosphere with friendly waiters.
We tried the PONG TAUHU SOUP, CURRY CHICKEN & MEATLESS MEATBALLS
RENDANG.
We will revisit again in future.
Thank you.
5
We went for dinner after reading amazing reviews about Violet Oon. It surpassed our expectations with regard to the food, decor and service. The restaurant is very charming and the servers are helpful and Oh so precise when they set the table :) The food is delicious - we had a chicken appetizer and a prawn+turnip filled in a cup thing. Both were delicious. Followed this with chicken curry and vegetarian meatballs - both divine. The highlight of the meal were their cakes gula melaka n sugee. We absolutely loved everything about the restaurant and will be back to try more dishes :)
5
We had visited Violet Oon's National Kitchen in the National Gallery last month. As we were very pleased, we decided to try the original outlet on Bukit Timah Road ( just before the Old Holland Road crossing)The decor, ambience, service and food were all top notch, reasonable value for money, and made for a very enjoyable evening out. Although we were vegetarians, there was enough choice on the menu, and the staff were very proactive in suggesting dishes, and also making sure there were no slip-ups vis-a-vis our dietary preferences. The dessert, a cake topped with gula melaka, was excellent, though laden with calories.The drink prices, are a little over the top, even by Singapore standards. Parking might be a problem, so suggest you take a bus or taxi
4
I strongly recommend their pulot hitam & bubur cha cha pannacotta, very beautifully done.
Each dish has it own favour and character.
5
We visit the Bukit Timah outlet for lunch. Compact, but charming and tasteful. The food is top notch. Love their take of the Nyonya standards. Awesome desserts to round up a highly satisfying experience
4
The discreet venue invites you to dine within a beautiful décor. Would definitely over order to share amongst friends! Do head here for a taste of nostalgia!
5
Great food and attentive service. Our party included a Malaysian who said it was the best Rendang they had ever tasted!
5
One of the very best dining experiences we have had, and excellent service for our wedding anniversary. Will definitely visit again!
4
Eat inside in the air conditioning and be prepared for a delightful meal. Expert Peranakan food. Great waiters. Small restaurant space.
4
We visited Bukit Timah branch in Sep and Oct 2016. Met Ms Violet in person, she is very friendly. Authentic, exploding flavours. Helpful waiters. Good ambience but too noisy when it is crowded. Ngo hiang, dry laksa, Babi pong Tay, beef rendeng, curry chicken are my favorite dishes, very delicious. Dessert Pulut Hitam and bubor cha cha are nice but a bit too sweet.
4
Food served here is top notch in terms of level of subtlety in taste, not that it is bland, but the flavours come through in waves! The dishes we had stronger in taste are the beef rendang, assam fish, both came through smooth in texture, yet intense in flavour; Where the assam fish has a tinge of sourness that lightly teases the tastebuds. beef rendang has in it tender beef shin meat and aromatic herbs that encircle the palate and then comes the punch of spices, . Both go really well with white rice.The dessert of choice was gula melaka cake. Make sure to get to the 2nd piece to really devour the light palmy sweetness and indulge in the aftertaste of quality ingredients which differentiates from the mass market, over-powering sugary kind. Left us wanting for more but not at $13++ a pop.Recommend the "atchara" to cleanse the palate in among dishes.One to forget was the tahu goreng though, as the beancurd was hardly the quivering kind we looked for, and portion was really small. Accompanying peanut sauce was comforting though.Take note if you are coming as a couple during dinner time, as this place is packed almost daily. For couples, the choice is to sit right smack in the middle of the hall where servers, customers, anyone really, walks in and out(just 3m from the front door), or outside, where one may have to contend with cigarette smoke, where beside it is a bar, so chances are high.Service is generally friendly, but some servers are quite selective who to be friendly to. When we were there, an elderly gentleman was perpetually stuck to 2 tables in that 2 hours we were there, while 1 has smiles all around for a group of Caucasian girls but nary a grin for the rest of the tables. A Filipino gentleman was really nice and helpful throughout our meal, and a local gentleman was very good with his recommendations together with his unique wit.Enjoy the experience and focus on the food, you will be alright

Ordered this from Celine/Lynette for takeaways, so I had much apprehension about the taste after I bring them home, worrying whether the taste will be affected once it loses heat. My worries were unfounded.In general, the portions may not be big. Yet it satisfyingly make it up with the explosion of taste in every bite! The Ayam Buah Keluak didn't disappoint especially with those delectable Buah Keluak fruits filled with Buah Keluak mince, something that many Peranakan outlets seem too avoid doing for the hassle. The chicken was tender to have them fall off the bone easily. We couldn't finish it, which means we can have them again tomorrow night, yay!The Babi Pongteh doesn't look aesthetically delectable, with it being black and all. But don't let its looks fool you. It literally melts in the mouth! A regret that I only ordered 1 serving.Also oreder the petai with prawns (nice) and achar; both didn't disappoint. They were pretty generous with the petai though I would prefer to have more of them, greedy as I am!Ordered the sayur lodeh and chap chye but being a meat-lover, I was literally distracted by the overpowering tastes of the meat dishes. According to my family members who had them, they were praising the thick gravy and delicious tofu (in the sayur lodeh). Vegetables were thoroughly soft too from the simmering in the pot. Also ordered the ngo hiang and they were amply packed with ingredients. Unliek the "hokkien"versions where their focus seems on the crispy skin of the roll, this one is packed full enough to make it a unique Peranakan version.We also ordered the dry mee siam and dry laksa. Disappointingly, the dry mee siam came with rice noodles (like those used in laksa) and not the fine vermicelli that we are used too. It might have been our mistake to order both because I couldn't tell the difference after the Buah Keluak. I'm neutral on these noodles.Also ordered the Tahu Goreng. It's ok, but would have been better if there were more gravy.Some misses I thought: I was recommended the tumeric chicken wings for the kids, but the taste was too dry and bitter for their liking. It did come with ample amount of lime though that we we used to offset the bitterness. We also ordered the assam fish and chilli fish; Both didn't really impress unfortunately. The assam fish was really not that fresh so it was quite a disappoint. I know, what use are fresh fish in assam gravy you say. Still it didn't impress. Price-wise, it is not cheap. Which Pernakan fare is anyway? I attribute it down to the amount of ingredients and effort required to make a delectable peranakan fare. So if the quality of the food has to be compromised in order to make it affordable? Don't!In summary, I will still go back to have my Pernakan dish fix, but will eat in-house next time. This time, I may get to try their Kueh Pie Tee and desserts too
5
Went to Violet Oon's at Bukit Timah for my birthday (Thanks Honey! Cuz my wife booked it). Being a peranakan boy myself, I was skeptical... Who can cook like my Ah Mah? No one! A French feel to the restaurant, but with nice peranakan tiles lining the ceiling and walls. We were ushered in after the service staff checked on our reservation ( and Yes! Do make a reservation as the restaurant is PACKED!!)Easy to navigate menu, and a nice little drink list. We ordered Nyonya Achar, Lemongrass Chicken Wings with Sambal dip, Asam Spanish Mackerel, Babi Pongte and Nyonya Chap Chye ( quite a lot I must say for 3 people). Sambal belachan is served to every diner. Rice, you have a choice between steamed jasmine rice and Nasi Kuning (Yellow Rice). All dishes are good for sharing as they are cut into portions, each dish would be good for 4 people... So makan (eat) now and regret later... As I found out later when my buttons were ready to pop!! Ordered too much!! Bang on flavored of old, fantastic service and good portion for $$. Nice ambiance, lovely dinnerware and surprised with a nice birthday cake! Unfortunately, one thing that they lacked in the restaurant which would give the authentic feel would be the ever rude old aunties who have been working there for way too long and calls the shots and tells you how to eat your food. Yep, they don't have that... I would've loved to share pictures of what I ordered but, was too eager to dig in I forgot to take pics! Sorry! Maybe my next visit.
5
Enjoyed the peranakan cusine and the service staff were excellent ! Although it was out of the way for us, it was worth the experience. Some dishes seem expensive but realised this is not the usual restaurant. very unique.
5
Besides delicious food, the excellent provided was awsome. I did not managed to get the name of the restaurant's Indian manager but his service was fanstatic!
5
We have been five times and every dish we've tried has been delicious. Meatless meatballs rendang and black noodles are our faves. Quite spicy though!
3
understaffed on wed night. food was ok, mostly catered to foreigners' taste. dessert too sweet. spent ave $40 w/o drinks.
5
Best to make reservations 2 weeks in advance. The place is quiet on a Sunday morning. Food served was delicious and had a nice presentation. Service staff was very friendly.
3
Set above a museum, slightly difficult to find when the Museum is closed, didn't help that the roads were all blocked off due to the Grand Prix. However once you arrive the buzz of the restaurant and the decor make it all worth while!! The dishes are imaginatively created, slightly fusion, and the very attentive waiters help with advice, food is freshly cooked and bought to your table when it's ready. For us it was a little too strongly flavoured, hasten to add we had a good evening. Worth a visit
5
This was my second visit to Violet Oon's and once again they didn't disappoint. The food was absolutely fabulous. What made it all the more enjoyable was the twist on local favourites. I absolutely loved the Ayam Buah Keluak noodles and the Dry Laksa. The Gula Melaka cake at the end so the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. My 84 year old father was hoping he could buy the cake off the shelf. That's how much he liked. it. We also had great service.The staff were friendly and they knew their stuff and made very practical recommendations. I need to go again as there is more on the menu I need to taste
5
I brought my husband and 2 kids here for lunch during the school holidays. Service is really good. Waiters came to check whether everything was OK about 10 times during our meal. We felt very well taken care of. I am also very happy that the waiters are Singaporeans. I think the food is good, though my husband who has a Peranakan grandmother said that his grandmother could cook better.Overall I enjoy eating here very much. The restaurant is beautiful, service is excellent. Though the food is not the best in Singapore, it is quite good. Prices are also cheaper than other restaurants in 5 star hotels
4
A lot of thought was put into the decor and aesthetics. Service was good, as was the food. Did not have to wait long for our meals to be served. The only drawback was it was really pricey for a neighbourhood restaurant. Almost $100 for 2 without drinks.
2
Ordered 4 dishes because the vegetable dish, ladies fingers were old and they replaced it. The sayur lodeh was too sweet, the sio bak kiam chye soup was too salty with the kiam chye still hard, a below average dish indeed. You could get much better soup at the hawker centre for a third of the price. Beef cheek rending was the only passable dish but its 36 bucks
5
The service at the restaurant was excellent and the waiters are very attentive! Their buah keluak noodle is a must try, a unique dish that you cannot find anywhere else.
5
One of the best meals we have had in a very long time . We certainly will be coming back. Only negative was that we feel we were being rushed to finish .
4
Tried the dry laksa much raved about but would prefer it without the peanut taste. Ngoh hiang was generously stuffed with meat that was not too minced so there's a good 'bite'. Loved the beef rendang that had very tender meat and addictive sauce!
3
Had their buah keluak noodles.
Mild tasting with tiny portion for $24!
Left feeling still a little hungry.
4
Really enjoyed the authentic Peranakan food and the waiters were really helpful with food recommendation along with their friendly service.
3
A cute restaurant with good decor. I love the kueh pie tee the most. The cod fish was not so fresh. The rendang was just so-so. Interesting panna cotta dessert with the peranakan flavor as the twist. Overall, I was not too impressed with the food.
4
I brought my family there for dinner, which included my children and parents. I made a reservation for 6pm, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as we enjoyed a quieter dinner until the full dinner crowd came in. The restaurant was fully booked for the evening.We ordered the sayur lodeh, nonya chap chye, assam fish, chicken curry, tumeric chicken, babi pongteh, ngor hiang, dry laksa noodles, gula melaka cake, papaya and banana smoothie and bubur chacha pannacotta. Overall, the food was good, the meat were tender and fall off the bone, the servings were decent and could satisfy this family of 6 (unlike many other restaurants where each serving could only serve 2-3 people only). To me, special mention for the assam fish, which was cooked to perfection and had the exact sourish tang that I was looking for. The babi pongteh was tender and juicy but I felt that the meat was too fat, the top fat layer was an inch thick! The chicken curry and sayur lodeh were very lemak, perhaps overly so, my mother lamented the lack of lemongrass flavour in the chicken curry (not sure if they do put any in). The dishes were not very spicy, perhaps to cater for the Western clientele, even the sambal belachan was not spicy enough for our local palate. So that was rather disappointing for us local clientele. As for dessert, I would highly recommend the gula melaka cake, one order was big enough for the family (we had a thin slice each, which was good enough for us), it was moist and flavourful. The bubur chacha pannacotta was very pretty in presentation and also very strong in the coconut flavour.Service was excellent, the staff were very responsive and professional, they made the effort to chat and laugh with us to make us feel at home. I cannot compliment the staff enough for their excellent service. The ambience in the restaurant was good, decor was excellent, there were even beautiful tiles placed on the walls and ceiling to evoke the Nonya feel.My only negative feedback (which is of no fault of the restaurant, it is an inherent problem in the area) is the problem of finding car parking spaces in the vicinity. I had anticipated the parking woes and therefore made an early reservation at 6pm. Even then, there weren't any available spaces, save for one, which I grabbed quickly. Otherwise, you will need to be prepared to drive around the residential estate and hope to find a lot. Or park illegally and hope that the traffic police don't turn up (which they do constantly because they know that this is a magnet area for illegal parking!)The other feedback is the steps leading up to the restaurant. My parents are in their mid to late seventies and have mobility issues. They could not climb the steep stairs leading up from the road on the side where there was an open air bar/pub, so we had to walk around to the front of the restaurant. Even then, there were 2 steps to step up onto, before getting into the restaurant, and one was very, very high. We had to support my mother who had knee problems and she found it an effort to step up and down, going in and out of the restaurant. Perhaps the restaurant could look into this mobility hurdle for their elderly customers.Overall, I would recommend this restaurant if you are interested in dining with family and friends, and are interested in trying out or love Peranakan food. I grew up eating Peranakan food and I can't wait to try Violet Oon's National Kitchen at National Gallery now

The Meal was great, from start to finish. Arrived early so were left unattended for about 10 minutes but service after that was very good with attentive, but not intrusive, waiters who knew what was being served. From the pork belly, beef rendang to Auntie Nanny's beef cheeks, the food was very, very good. Small wine list but the midrange red was also very good. First class meal, and not outrageously priced.
5
One of the best places I've been to for peranakan food. The decor is rather opulent, with heavy colored glossy tiles, mirrors, dim lighting and gold accents; but the food is down-ti-earth good Peranakan grub. Even my parents, who are very picky when it comes to food, approves of the food dished out from the chicken. The absolute stand out dishes were the tumeric chicken wings, buah leluak pasta and beef rendang - making special mention for the beef rendang, i've never had such amazing, super-soft rendang before, and the taste was beautifully fragrant and not too heavy on the palate. Chef Violet Oon has truly a gem of a restaurant here
5
I never like any laksa what so ever form it has. I have been recommended by a friend that the best dish at Violet is dry laksa. It was not disappointed! The spiciness and great combination ingredient make me love it! Plus with a glass of mojito
5
Excellent service by the manager of the restaurant. Food was flavourful and price was reasonable. Recommendations given by manager was excellent.
5
All my family members approved! Especially the desserts and the beef rendang! The nasi kunning was a special touch.
5
The food is very interesting but tasty. The environment is very nice , quiet, cosy and elegant. We have got great service.
4
Went for dinner on sunday and the place was full. Fortunately I had made a reservation. Food was great (especially the beef rendang) and so too was the service. Will go back again next time to try the other dishes.
4
The service was great, there was no issue considering I booked through a third-party site - chope, and purchased vouchers there as well. Food was nice and not to mention the fantastic interior and ambience.
5
My partner and I enjoyed every inch of our dining experience there. The waiters were great and ambience was perfect. We were already full but had to give the pulut hitam a go and it was delicious. Thank you to the entire team.
5
This had to be the best food we experienced in Singapore. We had a leisurely lunch catching up with friends and the staff could not have been more helpful and attentive. The building its self is stunning and the food is so tasty, traditional with the modern feel. The Meatless Meatballs Rendang were so delicious only to be topped by the Gula Melaka Cake
4
This place is out of town but worth the 10-15 minute taxi drive. The interior design itself is something to behold, it is a classy place with excellent service and unforgettable food. Everything we ordered was delicious - special mention to the turmeric chicken wings. Our waiter Matthew was brilliant - he chatted to us amicably and made us feel at ease. He also ordered us a taxi home! Fab place, you should go
5
I was pleasantly surprised by Violet Oon. A lovely little restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating on Bukit Timah Road.I ordered the coronation chicken starter and beef rendang main course and both were absolutely delicious in every way. The quality of the food was excellent and the staff offered some of the best service I've received in Singapore.The atmosphere was friendly and jovial, the staff knew their menu and made recommendations and the wine went with the food very well indeed. I thoroughly recommend Violet Oon, and I plan to make another trip here very soon. To sum up: excellent food, excellent service and a fantastic atmosphere.Thank you for a great evening guys

I visited Violet Oon Singapore for dinner with my family. The restaurant was nicely decorated and the service was generally quite good. Overall the food was alright but it was not excellent. However, I was disappointed with two things. Firstly, we were served a wrong dish that was similar to what we had ordered. As the wrong dish arrived first, we assumed that it was what we had ordered. We were asked if it was alright to pay for the dish. The second thing was more appalling, we were served dessert that had spoilt and had turned sour. This is not what I would expect from Violet Oon and my experience is very disappointing
5
All the food was absolutely delicious. The buah keluak, when you scoop it out of the nut, it was like scooping black caviar! Service was great, the waiters were engaging and knowledgable enough to advise you according to your likes and palate. Highly recommended!
5
Was at this outlet about last week. Was served by a delighful waiter named Hitesh who was attentive and explained the menu wonderfully.
5
Love the way they service and the food is awesome.
Most important the design of the restaurant is lovely and comfortable.
The negative thing is the limited of car-park lots, for people who drive is disadvantage.
5
Ambience, service and food were all excellent. Came here for a family dinner for my birthday celebration.
The penarakan food served will go down easy for anyone new to this.
3
Service was not very attentive compared to my previous visit. A check about the nationality of the Chef whether Peranakan, it was replied as Muslim. We wondering about the Babi ponteng which we ordered.
5
Was in national kitchen a few weeks back. And saw this Indian guy who had a wonderful smile and service who had informed us of his twin in Bukit Timah. Who served us wonderfully And was very attentive. Really impressed with the service I got. Simply love the ambiance and food
4
We had visited violet onn at national gallery and so decided to try this branch since it is the first restaurant.We ordered the tumeric chicken wings (loved the accompanying dip), fish tempra, dry laksa, roti jala and chendol for dessert.I could find nothing to fault. We savoured all the dishes and enjoyed it so much, we couldnt resist ordering a gula melaka cake to go.Thumbs up to the service crew (only caught one of their names, matthew) for the excellent service!This is what a stellar restaurant should be - good service, good food, good ambience
5
The service was excellent and the dishes we had were authentic and traditional. "Nonya Grandma-Approved" is how I would describe them! It's also important to note that this restaurant is not Halal, hence serving excellent babi pongtay. Their sister restaurant is Halal-certified. The only tweak they might need to make is in their reservation system. On previous occasions, I tried to call and book for this restaurant, but they kept informing me that it was fully booked at National Kitchen, their sister restaurant
5
VOS serves authentic peranakan food as "tested" by my 78-year-old mum who is a bibik. My mum definitely enjoyed herself immensely at a recent dinner @ VOS - our first time there! :) Our dinner party also liked the new twist VOS gives to some traditional peranakan ingredients such as buah keluak in VOS Buah Keluak Noodkes - we loved it very much. VOS desserts are just right and not so sweet which makes them delectable to both the young and old. The dinner would be even better if there was one more choice of soup such as the peranakan fish maw soup which we thought we could get at dinner @ VOS.
5
We've been to Violet Oon several times and the experience never disappoints. It starts with welcoming service into the beautiful and warm ambience of the restaurant. The wait staff is excellent, recalling what we tried on previous visits and recommending new dishes for us to try. The service is both attentive and relaxed. The food is simply outstanding. Flavors that you won't have anywhere else and each dish a memorable experience. We can't wait until our next visit.
4
We were greeted by friendly staff and served by one who knows the menu well.
The dishes were served in nice
Great experience overall.
Would score a 5 if the dishes are made less salty.
3
Some of the dishes are very good but compared to other peranakan restaurants of similar standard, this placed is overpriced.
2
Good atmosphere, service was alright. The food is not great; coronation chicken has an odd taste, curry chicken was too salty and duck soup has a stench. There is room
for improvement.
5
Lovely food, beautiful cosy restaurant. Each dish we tried was delicious and the staff were very helpful on the spiciness of the food. Will come again.
4
Great ambience and service from staff. Food is authentic and great taste. For the dried laksa and babi assam which taste good but just felt that it's too small a portion for its price.
Overall still good experience.
5
Reserved Violet kitchen for dinner. It was wife birthday dinner. We love the place very much. Beautiful and a touch of elegance. Food and service was good. Tempura fish with sambal is our favorite. Must try. Keep it up guys.
5
Good was excellent. Service was pretty good. The burbur char char dessert was pretty amazing. Had a great time!
4
Good food, good company..
Always liked the cozy ambience.
A nice place for gathering of family and friends or a date.
5
Had a wonderful lunch with my wife to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We were served by friendly and personable staff, esp Hitesh. We had delightful ayam buah keluak, flavourful chap chye and fresh fish that was topped by caramelised onion. Not too crowded on a Sun afternoon in a very cosy restaurant. Had a very good gula melaka cake with ice cream, with sweet compliments from the staff. They also took a photo of us for our keepsake. We are impressed!A definite must go for those who want to sample true blue Singapore food, cooked with greatest care and quality
2
All I can say is, this restaurant is like a pretty model. Looks good but no substance. The food here is so so, the price is SO not worth it. I'd recommend Good'O times at Changi Village in a heart beat. Doesn't look pretty but sure can cook. I don't recommend this place
5
Don't go without a reservation! Not a very large restaurant and full days, weekday or weekends. we had the prawns, fish, pork and lamb, all excellent. Wonderful service.
4
This restaurant is a gem along the busy Buket Timah road. It serves a range of South East Asian dishes with tastes of Singapore and Indonesia, Malaysia. Service is efficient and friendly The atmosphere smart relaxed. We shared our dishes and they were all delicious.
4
Food was great. I especially love the Gula Melaka Cake. it is a worth to try. I will definitely visit this place again.
4
The interior design of the place is quite remarkable with the black and white tiles. Food is authentic Malay which can be rich but worth trying. Can't remember the name but try the dish with the black nuts. Prices are moderate by SG standards.
5
Brought my parents there for a belated Mother's Day and advanced birthday celebrations. Service staff were very friendly and pleasant, and always had a smile on their faces. We ordered Nonya Achar, Ngoh Hiang, Curry Chicken, Garam Assam Fish, Chap Chye, Burbur Chacha Pannacotta and Pulut Hitam. My parents had nothing but praises for all the dishes, which is something considering my mother is quite particular on food taste. Will definitely go back again in the near future
3
To say I'm disappointed is an under statement. Our waitress was clueless from start to finish. Despite telling her we are pure vegetarian at the very start and the bits that we cannot eat, and even after checking with the kitchen, we were still brought out a plate which clearly contained fish sauce. When we checked with another waiter, who went back to the kitchen, our food was removed. But only after we'd already eaten some of it! As an apology, they offered us some deserts 'on the house'. On further inspection, of course the panna cotta was made with pig's geletine. These guys are clueless, stay away if you have special dietary requirements! In addition, the bits that did come out as requested, lacked oomph and flavour. So underwhelming. You are better off at Chop Suey in Dempsey
2
Decor and service at Violet Oon's are good. However, the weekend brunch was very disappointing. We ordered the banana gula melaka french toast to share between my daughter and I, and my husband had the 'asian big breakfast'. French toasts turned out to be cold, a misly total of 1.5 pieces of bread (normal household bread) and a side serving of gula melaka with 3 tiny pieces of banana. That cost $15, which I could've made in my own kitchen for less than $1.50. We were also informed that the flavored rice in my husband's dish was not ready (it was already past 11am) and that would be replaced with white rice.We really expected much more from a famed chef. Sadly, this disappointing experience has dissuaded us from patronizing her restaurant again.
4
We tried that restaurant yesterday and it was excellent.The food is tasty, traditional but presented on a classy way.The restaurant is cosy and charming and the terrace windy and enjoyable ( even with the main road noisy the music covers the sound).Outside of the delicate meals the waiters are fabulous, kind, smily and well educated!We loved the food and it's like a back to the 50's where everything was just class and raffinate
5
This hidden jewel in Bukit Tima sits right beside the famous Forture Seafood restaurant. Just recently renovated, the dining area of Violet Oon resembles what one could describe as a Singaporean semi, fine-dining bistro.Though I dined alone, I made sure to try at least 2 appetizers and 2 main courses of their signature dishes. It was one of the best meals I have ever had in Singapore with and excelent display of balance in spice and proficiency in the execution of the dishes which ultimately translated into a feast of flavor and texture.The cuisine is an anapologetic homage to the Aunties and Grandmas of Peranakan heritage who spent countless hours creating magic in their kitchens.My new favorite Straits restaurant and cannot wait to come back with a group to try many, many more dishes.I also have to commend the service which was excellent. Front of the house folk knew their stuff and were very good in recommending how to have a great first experience here
4
The peranakan food here is tasty! All the chilli that come with the dishes were fine for the palate. It was not burning spicy. The venue is small and peak hours are between 7 pm to 8 pm on weekends. I like the assam fish and egg plants- must try! Service staff very friendly and knowledgeable. Happy to be back soon
3
Just an average restaurant which didn't impress me with the food and service.
Food is OK and that's all you can say.
5
Great food and excellent service with local upmarket decor. Great to bring visitors. Servings are small but great for sharing size so you get to try more of the menu. Spice had less spicy options for those who need it
5
The food is wonderful, service better than Michelin and great value for money. Great place to bring visitors to try Paranakin food. Have a drink at Bar Bar next door first.
5
Venue great, food great, service fantastic - well worth it. The staff were very attentive and helpful, and food very tasty.
5
I found this restaurant to be excellent. The decor was lovely, and the staff very friendly, helpful and diligent. The food itself was expensive, but excellent quality. Would recommend the cod in lakhsa sauce! Truly magnificent.
4
Wonderful staff, good ambience and excellent food. Definitely bringing my family there again. Well done!
5
Great service, food, wine, atmosphere! Wonderful place. Have been there with my husband and also with a group of girlfriends a few times and would highly recommend it.
5
Food was prepared and presented well. Waiters are very knowledgeable on how each dish was prepared and recommended great tea and dessert to finish the meal with.
5
The food is fabulous and the service is even better. Our waiter did a great job in explaining the various dishes, which ones would go together and the appropriate amount of food to order. He had previous experience working in 5 star cruise lines which was clearly evident by his exceptional service throughout the meal. This was our second visit and the experience was outstanding both times. We're already looking forward to our next visit
4
The facade of the restaurant wowed me even before entering. I had high expectations of the place before trying out the food here for the first time. Each main course can serve up to 2 Pax, so don't over order. Ask the server if in doubt, they willadvise you. Tried the Babi Assam, ladies fingers, salted vegs and pork soup and a dessert, Pulut Hitam. Everything tasted so good!! Average spending per pax is around $30. This place seems to attract a lot of foreigners. I believe there ain't many places in Singapore which served good authentic Nyoya and Perankan food like Violet Oon does. I will be back to try other dishes! Don't forget to make reservation in advance just in case the house is full.
3
Food overall was nice especially the beef rendang. Service was excellent. Parking at the vicinity was not convenient as we had to search a long time for a parking lot.
5
Service beyond expectations.
Food is tasty and yummy.
Portion is enough for a family.
Ambience is authentic yet classy.
5
A little on the expensive side but the food quality was superb. Just don't order the zhapchye. Desserts was very very delicious!
4
Very nice retro-coffee shop like setting. Food is good and flavourful, they have not taken too many liberties with the traditional local favourites and so this appeals to a traditionalist and "semi-local" like myself.
The Rendang is a must try!
4
The setting is beautiful; great introduction to Peranakan food for your overseas friends. Rather pricey.
5
Chic restaurant with authentic Nonya fare. Attentive service and staff who knew their menu well. Great for family or gathering of friends especially if you want a quality feel for the event.
5
The refurbished of the restaurant is a real improvement. The style is a mix between colonial style , French Brasserie with Penang accents. The waiters are stylish , knowledgable , very efficient and extremely friendly !The food .... perfect Peranakan food WITH classics as beef rending but then cooked to perfection. Apart from the taste a lot of effort has been put into the presentation of the food. This was the second time we went tho Violet Oon but definitely not the last time !
4
Come for the day at the gallery or just pop in for lunch or dinner. (Reservations are not required but encouraged.) The food is delicious! The black/white/silver/gold theme with classic looks and shimmer will put your mind at ease and open your appetite for a tasty treat. Lunch will set you back around $50 w/o wine or beverage. Enjoy the ambiance and fill your soul with a gastronomic symphony
4
As it was a large family gathering - we decided to cater through Violet Oon catering division . Lots of wonderful child hood memories came back eating tonight ! Highlights were the ayam buah keluak , chicken curry , pie tees, sambal prawns & the dry laksa ! Try also the meatless spaghetti - yum Beautiful food cook to perfection
4
For many years I have enjoyed sampling local cuisine in the hawker centre and in some sense aside from eating in someone's home this is perhaps the most authentic or traditional (dare I claim as a foreigner!) way to do it. I finally had to try this place when I'd heard multiple colleagues speak very highly of the food. I had the Beef Rendang and my wife had fish, plus we had some vegetables and pickles. I really loved both the pickles and rendang. The pickles we had both had a great taste and seemed from very fresh, quality ingredients. The rendang was neither super-tender nor tough, somewhere in between and the gravy on it was so savory and tasty. The cocktails we had were well made to though a bit on the sweet side for my palate (not a surprising thing in Singapore, everything seems to be a bit sweet to me). Our server was very friendly and polite, though we did have to work a bit to get attention from the staff at times. The place itself is very clean and nicely decorated and has a great feel to it
5
Authentic Peranakan Food! Lemak Chicken Curry was excellent. Rendang as well. Ngoh Hiang was very authethic too
5
Authentic, great service beautiful ambience. A great place to bring overseas visitors to experience Singaporean food in a nice setting.
5
Special night out with friends and it was everything we hoped it would be.
Attentive staff, wonderful surroundings and the food was amazing 👏
Will definitely return
4
First time trying out this famous peranakan place - Violet Oon. Savory authentic nyonya food. Try the assam fish and babi pontay.
5
We have walked past this restaurant many times, but decided to try it out for a birthday meal. It was such a good decision. The waitress really helped us with the Peranakan inspired menu and the food exceeded our expectations. Nice atmosphere, great food and kindness that we won't forget
5
This place is an institution, and deservedly so - wonderful Nonya food, with real character and individuality. It's a fair way out of central Singapore, but oh so well worth the trip.Five of us combed the menu, selecting a wide variety of dishes. The butterflied prawns, cod in a coconut sauce and the beef rendang were highlights, but everything was excellent. And above all, save room for desserts. We thought we were too full for them, but they all disappeared with sighs of satisfaction and groans of over-indulgence.The staff were very busy, but unfailingly prompt and helpful - if in doubt about anything, follow their advice!The precise location is a little difficult for taxis (specially Uber cars) to find, so when you leave, ask a local to ensure that the driver knows exactly where to meet you.The drinks list is small, with no wine by the glass,but who cares? The food's the thing, and if you must have a drink other than tea, Tiger is the perfect liquid accompaniment.The atmosphere is loud and cheerful - the happy noises of diners having a great time. Value is fair - the prices are extremely reasonable for what is offered.Not to be missed - and next time I'm in Singapore, I intend to try her new place at the National Gallery
5
so this has a very nice venue with titles and yet black and white theme - the entire place looks very tasteful. National kitchen looks similar but its hard to get a reservation there whereas this place its still possible to do walk-in. The waiters are very good - friendly and knowledgeable. They recommended all the favorites which were the normal peranakan food but at the same time they also had non typical peranakan dishes but still peranakan with the same flavours e.g. dry laksa noodles or buah keluar noodles. The normal dishes like chap chye are so flavorful because they use so much prawn paste in the sauce that the gravy is very almost like soup. Total bill per pax is about sgd50/pax.
4
Violet Onn does not fail to impress with her decidedly refined local dishes. Although similar dishes could be found peppered across the island at a fraction of the prices at VO, the black-and-white classical French ambience, great service and delicious food make it worth at least an initial visit. Try the sayeh lodeh. It's the best dish in the house and possibly the world by my book, with its distinct sweetness and coconut-y aroma. Skip the dry laksa and dry mee siam though. Too expensive at $22 for a tiny bowl with 4 prawns. And they are no match for the real McCoys at Nancy (Katong laksa) and Royals
4
We tried a series of food but what stood out was the Kueh Pie Tees, drizzled with the sweet sauce and spicy belachan! I've been to Violet Oon before and I realised they took out their Chili Crab dip after the renovation - a pity though since I remember it to be one of the highlights the last time I was there
5
The Violet Oon restaurant, which opened 3 years ago, is well worth the taxi ride into the centre of the island of Singapore. (If you’re driving, they have a parking valet). It is a family restaurant in the best possible way – marrying wonderful recipes from Violet Oon who I remember well from writing about food in the 1980s, with the passion of her son and daughter who recognised the need to secure a lasting legacy and secured investment to make this possible. The menu is well considered, and perfect for shared dishes, and the manager was careful to advise a balanced choice where each course worked well within the overall meal. Kick start the palate with pickles and fried bean curd; share tiny crispy cups “Kuay Pie Tee”; order two succulent beef cheeks; ramp the chilli up a notch with fried red snapper; don’t forget the sambal eggplant and the delicate Roti; and wind down with the Kesturi Lemon Pie and a Gula Melaka Cake. Sublime.A year ago, I revelled in the Peranakan cuisine I found in the heart of Georgetown, Penang. Well, now I know that you don’t have to go that far for perfect flavours and an authentic Nyonya experience
4
Great ambiance, good service, delicious food and served in good portion. Will come back for special occasion.
5
Excellent quality & service from Alvin. Good to test original food and get advice from the waiters........................
5
Very good persnakan cuisine. Lovely restaurant, very nice waiters (Alvin was very good at explaining the dishes and helped us to choose the best dishes to share)
5
Great dishes, efficient service and a wonderful ambience! Singapore is not short of good restaurants, but I greatly enjoyed eating here.
4
With the investment partnership from TWG co-founder, the resturant has reborn with distinctive positioning, professional service, luxurious and nostagic dinning ambience; contemporary food styling and menu. It has an air of international sophistication, which is rare for Singapore food establishment. Their new outlet at National Gallery Singapore is poised to be a choice destination for tourists and Singaporeans who want a piece of Singapore's history. A satisfying meal featuring 6 to 8 communal dishes to share in the Paranakan style is about $50 per head. Highly recommended if you have no budget constraint and enjoy elegant dinning ambience. The only indigestible element is the over branding of VO loudly in every piece of crockery and cutlery. Perhaps the marketing team is paving the path for VO branded food line impatiently
5
This was my first visit to Singapore and as we were meeting friends whom live there asked them to book somewhere we could try the local cuisine. Our friend chose a selection of dishes for us to try and they were beautifully plated but more importantly they tasted amazing. Great flavours and excellent ingredients, the prawns were really good. Then came desert which I normally struggle with as I can't eat dairy, so it was such a pleasure to be able to eat coconut ice cream with some fab sweet rice puds. It was no surprise then to read in the Sunday Times that Violet Oon had been chosen to open a restaurant in the National Gallery
4
Table was not ready on arrival and we had to wait 30 minutes, but were comp'd 2 glasses of wine for the long wait - a nice touch. The Ngoh Hiang bean curd wrap rolls for a starter were excellent. Service was very attentive and friendly. Overall a lovely evening
5
We had dinner at Violet Oon's Kitchen in Singapore tonight and it was an extraordinary and memorable experience ... the meatless meat balls were a revelation ... the soups were beyond anything we've ever had before ... the tastes and textures of all the carefully prepared food, all made daily from scratch, were simply marvelous ... and the manager, assistant manager and all the staff we met were so warm, attentive and professional ... can't wait to return ... and visit the new branch which just opened at the National Gallery of Art ...
5
I have been searching for good Peranakan food in Singapore and now it is found! The menu is so different to anything else found in Singapore. The Chinese-Malay influences produce truly exotic flavours. The charming son of the owner spent time at our table explaining the dishes and how to enjoy the food at its best. This added a much appreciated understanding of just how special this food is. The ambience is great and the decor rather sophisticated. This restaurant will always be a first call for us when looking for something special
5
Just go! This place is run by a family who have made such an effort in every way. The attention to detail of the over 100 year old tiles on the walls to the consistently of the mosaic leads you to beige they really do care. But then you eat the food and the Chef who happens to be the Mum (of course) leaves you breathless.The staff are simply divine in their conversation and the maitre de (the Son) is charm itself with his lovely family stories. The waiting staff were just as proficient an there is a genuine enthusiasm for your well being which is often lacking in our little red dot.I have never written a review on trip advisor but as this is within walking distance to my house and it was my first visit, I never want it to leave
4
Very welcoming and friendly staff and atmosphere. Cozy restaurant with an intimate atmosphere. Interesting menu with great food. A little bit of Singapore history to enjoy.
4
Service was great, the restaurant itself is beautifully decorated. I enjoyed the starters very much. Mains were a little hit and miss. But overall we enjoyed dinner here. Great for a date night!
5
reservation was easy and fuss free though max pax allowable at the drops own lists is 6 but the restaurant reads the special request which is to arrange for more than 6. food and service was excellent too.
3
Few food for child only. Serving portion could be better. Tasted better or peranakan food.
Plus point is there's a bar counter. Good for business/ social meet up.
4
I made a dinner reservation via Chope. Despite that I was slightly late, the restaurant staff was polite and held the tables upon my requests. Although there was a tiny error in the food served, the staff was friendly and quick to replace it with our right dish. Violet Oon serves fabulous Peranakan food and it left my partner and I very satisfied. The ambience was great as well, a cosy and well managed place. Keep it up folks
5
I was taken here by friends as we celebrated a number of birthdays. The food was GREAT, and Raj looked after us really well. The food was very Malaysian/Indonesian, and really well prepared. As we had let it slip that we celebrated, the staff also brought us a selection of deserts, on the house. Grea
4
Been here twice before and for brunch, the service was poor, the dinner was a disappointment for 3 of the 4 diners. Went after the revamp and the service was outstanding along with the food. Nice touch to have the son of Violet come to the table to ask about the meal / experience. We will return
3
We'd been dying to try the new VO since its revamp, so picked a Sunday evening. Turned out to be quiet, there was only 1 other table. However that meant service was excellent! Unfortunately they were out of buah keluat ayam but no matter, the buah keluat spaghetti was an interesting twist on the classic. All of the flavour was there. Besides that we also enjoyed the sambal egg plant - not too spicy or undercooked (which often happens in this dish). Overall decent food and good service
5
Since Kim Choo in Katong closed a few years ago, we haven’t found a Peranakan place with traditional décor and the full range of Peranakan cuisine (read pork). Kim Choo was where we took overseas guests for a kind of a museum cum eating experience, and now we have Violet Oon Singapore on Bukit Timah Road.But this is not just a Peranakan restaurant. It’s got a number of Singaporean dishes (chicken rice, anyone?) and therein lies a potential problem. Can a Peranakan-themed place retain its character if its menu expands beyond it heritage? Perhaps Violet Oon can carry it off, if anyone can. We weren’t really hungry and wanted something light and soupy for lunch; a Peranakan soup seemed just the right thing to have. We ordered sio bak kiam chye, a broth described as roasted pork, salted mustard greens, dried chilli, with fresh mustard greens in a nutmeg infused broth. The soup was absolutely heart-warming in every way. The roast pork moist and cooked enough for the meat to fall apart, the salted veg crisp and (not too) sour, and the broth delicately flavoured but robust. The portion was good enough for two as a starter. Although we hadn’t planned to have anything else, we ordered a portion of roti jala as we don’t often see it. This flat bread made from a very liquid batter that is formed into a lacy prata-like bread. It tastes quite unique and is hard to find in Singapore (though fairly common in Malaysia). The roti jala was good but quite insubstantial – on a good day we would have needed two portions each had it been the only carb. Not having ordered a curry we had it with the sambal that was provided gratis, which turned out to be a great decision – the sambal was perfectly compounded, and tempered with calamansi, was the dish of the day. We had the signature dessert, made by Violet Oon herself, gula Melaka cake with coconut ice cream ($17). The cake was perfect – moist and not too sweet, the coconut ice cream forming a successful pairing with it. A small wrinkle was the cake’s consistency – it was smooth, while we would probably have preferred a slightly grainy feel (like a suji cake). The portion was generous enough for two to share comfortably. We finished with kopi ($5). The service was exemplary. The small restaurant (~40 covers) had six wait staff who were well informed, attentive and friendly, willing and able to discuss both the food and the history of the restaurant with us. Violet’s son Ming, who was behind the counter spent time at every table making sure diners were well taken care of.One of the things that set the restaurant apart for us was the décor. It was perfect in every way, from the black & white floor tiles and the exquisite ceramic tiles on the walls and ceiling (don’t miss them) to the exclusive serving dishes and tableware. Words can’t do it justice – a visit is suggested.Overall, a very good and satisfying meal, which could be construed as expensive (compared to a similar meal at a food centre) or inexpensive (for a comparable experience in a comparably smart restaurant). We consider it the latter, and will be back very soon
5
Went to Violet Oon last night for dinner with a couple of friends. It was y first time back since the refurbishment. I was a bit nervous as I had recommended it to our friends. I need not of worried. The new decor is breathtaking...... Inside and out has been transformed. Lovely tiles on the ceilings and walls and great lighting. The food was as wonderful as before, especially the Beef Rendang and gado gado salad. One of my friends wanted to try chicken rice for the first time even though his wife don't order it, it's so boring. Well the chef proved her wrong, it was presented with many little dishes to accompany and tasted sublime. The waiters and waitresses were lovely and looked after us well despite a full restaurant. Only small gripe was closing at 10.30 felt too early as we were having such a good time. Great evening

You can taste the family pride in each bite. Wonderfully almost perfectly executed traditional recipes that bring out the layers of complex flavours.

There was not a nice thing to say about the food. Felt pretty ripped off. Diners are better off at Ivin's.

Great service from very friendly and knowledgable staff. Fantastic food. We will come again when next visiting Singapore.

Can't recommend Violet Oon's Kitchen high enough! Staff is in top of their game always ready to recommend on the menu and assist with every request! Food was amazing! Truly exquisite Peranakan cuisine! We had a fantastic diner and can't wait to visit again!

Along Bukit Timah road, quite easy to drive past so you have to slow down, very near Cherry Ave. Interior decor is very classy ambience, that nostalgic colonial "Nyonya" charm with use of colourful intricate tiles on walls and ceiling. Family style dining so hard to order variety for two people. Beef rendang meat is tender and flavourful on the sweetish side, curry chicken sauce authentic unfortunately the chicken meat was not tender and didn't taste fresh. Overall good experience but pricey for the portions, frequented by affluent locals. As we were there on a Saturday would have been nice to have a set lunch. Very small place so advise book in advance

If one is looking for good peranakan food in Singapore, look no further, this is the place to go. Most of the dishes tasted really good, though the cod in creamy laksa sauce was a littled over-fried and was too dry. My personal favourites are the buah keluak ayam and the beef rendang, they were so so tender. The spice notes in the dishes were awesome too. The service at the restaurant was not too bad with good dessert recommendations by the staff.If only other aspects could be as good - (a) Someone please answer the phone - I called 6 times on Thursday and 5 times on Friday before someone picked up the phone. My email on Thursday to make a reservation also went unanswered. (b) Consider improving the accoustics of the place (better sound-absorbing boards needed?) - Although I love the peranakan flavor in the decor, it was really noisy in the restaurant on a Friday night, it felt like everyone was shouting to be heard above the din. (c) For the price paid, I was rather surprised by the small servings
1
To clarify at the outset, I have not dined at this establishment and therefore cannot comment on food quality. Had I been able to contact the restaurant for a table reservation, I might have been able to post a more favourable review. I rang 8 times yesterday, all were either unanswered or played a recorded message declaring that the "Singtel mobile customer is not in service". How strange, I thought.On the 9th time, my call was answered by a the gentleman (I am assuming from the Sub-Continent as he asked for my "good name") who promised to ring me back following a brusque "I'll need to call you back - we're very busy, you know." He never did. To be fair, it didn't help that this was in the middle of a busy dinner service. However, unanswered phone calls continued today (at the start of lunch service).Be that as it may, first impressions count and this one didn't get off to a good start. Business must be good for them to turn customers away with such disregard but it'll be a long, long way to fall for the high and mighty. A shame indeed, considering the good reviews here (albeit from people with single reviews - how interesting)

Went there for lunch after the restaurant reopened and was immediately charmed by the new decor, with genuine Peranakan tiles over the walls and even the ceiling! This has cut down on the noise which hampered conversation in the past. The menu has been extensively reworked and now serves more authentic Peranakan fare. My personal favorite is the daging chabek, though some may not like the sweetness of the gravy ( gula Melaka goes into it) but the sweetness is offset by the subtle tanginess of the tamarind in the sauce. Roti jala is hard to find in most restaurants but you can watch as it is made. Another unique dish is the sayor kuakchye, which is pickled mustard greens, something I haven't tasted for years. The coronation chicken in wantan leaf cup is something new to me and is worth a try Rounding up the feast, the mini Kueh sarlat is a must and being mini one feels less guilty. Put aside your guilt for a moment and indulge in the gula Melaka cake.. Which is to die for!Only snag is the shortage of parking spaces so try to car pool with your friends

The recent renovations have turned this local favourite into a lovely, slightly luxurious dining establishment with beautiful interiors. It's also returned to the original ethos of sumptuous Peranakan food cooked well, away from the previous iteration of 'fusion style' food. Would definitely go back!
1
I read all the good reviews so I decided to try. Was 100% disappointed.Snooty arrogant cocky serviceDishes small, like micro. Everything served cold (not supposed to be)Prices exhorbitant (23 bucks for tiny portion of beef rending?)Here's the best part. We were a table of 7. Ordered a bottle of wine (we ordered the house white, which was a pricy $65). We finished, no one wanted more wine (it was lunchtime) except me, so I ordered a glass. Now here's the best part: they came back and said sorry sir, we do not have that house wine anymore by the glass, but we do have that by the bottle.Can you believe that? Basically the damn owner there so god damn greedy didn't want to serve a glass to us (even though its on the menu as served by the glass and bottle), and said 'they are out'. But then said they have it by the bottle only.I will NEVER EVER go back to this place again.Seriously, you are GST registered, so you are making millions. How greedy can you get

I was there with a friend for lunch. The food is far from being Peranakan. The chicken buah keluak, for instance, did not taste authentic. The meat was not infused with the taste of buah keluak. It seems that the chicken was cooked first and then briefly simmered in the gravy. We ordered 4 dishes and the only one which I rated good is the tahu goreng. The rest were very average. And they are very expensive, in relation to the taste and quality. I asked the captain on why the food tasted anything but Peranakan and he told me that the food was fusion. I wanted to order chendol for dessert but was told that it is not the traditional chendol which I am familiar with but is actually chendol panecotta. OMG
3
Tried the Pong Tauhu Soup, Ngoh Hiang and Gado Gado as starters. The soup is prawn based, however lacks flavor and quite bland on the day we tried. Ngoh Hiang was of good quality, a bigger portion would have been better for the price paid. The sauce for the Gado Gado was given separately and good. However I prefer the sauce to be mixed together in a good blend with the Gado Gado ingredients. For mains, we tried Buah Keluak Ayam, Garam Assam Fish and Chap Chye. The chicken and fish dishes were excellent, however the portions are too little to share for a table of 4pax. The Chap Chye is average. Ambience is luxurious and the place looks to be renovated not too long ago. Generally service is good. Lack of parking space, you will need to find parallel parking near the landed houses. This appears to be more high end Peranakan food as prices are mostly much higher and portions much less as compared to other Peranakan restaurants around the island

Visited this place with my family - group of four - 2 kids and 2 adults.Food menu is good and innovative.Best dish by far is the Pepper pasta - veg & non veg which is outstanding. Seating is a bit squeezed in the air-conditioned part of the restaurant.Kids menu was good to make it a family friendly place.Only complaint was that the Coke light was made in Malaysia (as opposed to Singapore) and for some reason that tastes awful.......have experienced it before as well. Apart from that decent place overall and worthwhile trying out the innovative dishes with local flair by Violet Oon
5
We were staying with a friend nearby so could walk here easily. Violet's served local food well cooked and presented along with some English dishes for breakfast. These we ignored and over half-a dozen visits worked our way through the menu. The durian pudding should be tried at least once but I couldn't really get my head around a sweet containing beans. Every main course was really tasty but I have no idea how authentic. Suffice to say when we return to Singapore we will be coming here again. The staff are really helpful and friendly. They lend umbrellas when it rains
3
Always on the look-out for Peranakan cuisine,Violet Oon's is also close to home in Bukit Timah. It's an attractive bistro-style venue, with a good cocktail menu and a simple food one. For starters we had a couple of dips - spicy crab and buah keluak ( chicken made with the kernel of the black nut, a real Peranakan speciality) with the thinnest and most delicious crispy pitta Ive had in along time. For mains we stuck with the buah keluak and had the chicken; however the chicken didn't seem as if it had been cooked in the black nut sauce for long enough to become properly infused by the flavour of the sauce, pleasant though it was ie a bit bland! Better was the pork belly, which had been simmered in tis sauce for along time and was sticky and delicious. Both come with rice and pickles and a spoonful of limp salad. The recommended okra (wing beens were 'off' which was a pity) were horrible, almost raw, cold and with a dollop of shrimp paste sauce. NOT recommended. Husband had a light and yummy sticky date pudding, as his chosen Peranakan dessert was also 'off' - a shame really. So would I go back? maybe, but I still prefer Blue Ginger, or the real thing in Melaka! The service was good, smiling and prompt. So quick we struggled to have the second glass of (reasonably priced) wine
4
Started with a couple of great Cosmopolitan's... :-)Meatless meatballs (parmesan and walnut) appetizer was absolutely delicious... as were the Spanish mackerel and black diamond pasta (which was REALLY good) mains...We were tempted by dessert and were not disappointed... the sticky toffee pudding was fab... the tapioca cake was pretty good too... they were heavy desserts and we probably did not need 2 ;-)Definitely a recommend - would love to come back, but just a few days left in Singapore with so much more to do :-

I used to live in Singapore and loved the local food. Before a recent visit I asked around for the latest eateries and was told Spanish tapas is the rage. May be but I don't go to Singapore to eat tapas! Peranakans are the mixed race people largely the result of immigrant Chinese who married Malay women in the 19th century. The food is influenced by both cultures although the spicy Malay cuisine dominates. Violet Oon is a well known Singaporean chef who has blended traditional Peranakan with some contemporary food ideas. Brilliant result. Try buah keluak pasta - buah keluak is the meat of local nut which is minced and more typically served with chicken. Starters included dips of chilli crab (another local favourite) and more buah keluak with home made pitta bread. The chicken curry was to die for accompanied by unrecognizable, stringy roti - so light.The restaurant dÃ©cor is influenced by the traditional shop house style but is very funky. We ate outside on the veranda surrounded by black and white bamboo blinds - fabulous weather given that it had rained heavily a little earlier. We found inside a bit too chilly. And finally service was professional and friendly, especially the Tamil guy. A great experience. Unreservedly recommended
5
I never fancy peranakan food, as a healthy food eater, it is just too much for me. However, the dishes at Violet Oon's really worth for to break the rules that I have.Each dish is so rich in taste but doesn't feel so heavy at all.As an Indonesian I satisfy my local food craving with their Gado gado, which exactly what I would love to have. The pong tahu Soup is yummy, the sambal Bendi, i just love how simple is the dish but the chili called out Tasty taste
4
food serving was fast and staff were friendly. The dry laksa was good except it was a tad too salty.
4
Love both the brunch and dinner menus. Especially the pulled pork burrito for brunch and chicken curry with roti Jala for dinner. The Peanut Butter milkshake was really good as well.
4
I was taken on a business lunch to Violet Oon's Kitchen because I had not been to an authentic Peranakan restaurant before. For non-Singaporeans: this is traditional Singaporean food, a curious mixture of Malaysian and other regional fare, old British favorites like bangers and mash, and some other Western-style food. Except for one person who had rigatoni, my group ordered dishes like beef rendang (spicy beef dish in a coconut-milk base with kaffir and bay leaves), chicken curry, and buah keluak khayam, a chicken dish with large nuts that are actually poisonous until they're prepared properly through fermentation (no worries!). Unique experience, tasty food, funky place with pleasant decor. Definitely recommend--and enough of a range of choices for almost anyone's taste, whether you're adventurous or not

Wife and I had our anniversary dinner at Violet Oon recently. The restaurant itself is very well designed and the decor is great. The staff were friendly enough and accommodating. We ordered some wine - reasonably priced and good quality. The menu is very different from most other places and we were overwhelmed but the staff recommended a few plates. We had laksa dry, sambal undang and a plate of dips. Food was 8/10 - very tasty, good portions, piping hot and well presented. One of the dips wasn't great (tapenade) but otw excellent. Desert was amazing - sticky toffee and date pudding. Only problem was a few items we wanted were out of stock - we will have to come back
5
I had a hard time finding the place as I am unfamiliar with that area. I called up the restaurant and the person that I was speaking to was really friendly and nice. He even helped to 'reserve' a carpark lot in front of the restaurant. I had a great time there and my mom loves all the food! Tip to get to the restaurant: if you are driving along Bukit Timah road from City, you can turn left into Maple Ave and turn right into Cherry Ave. The restaurant is right at the end of Cherry Ave! If you missed the left turn into Maple Ave, you can turn left at the next entrance into Old Holland Road, then turn left again into Redwood Ave, turn left into Elm Ave and turn Left into Cherry Ave and you will find the restaurant! Hope this helps everyone who is trying to find the place. Will definitely visit the place again

Situated between a pub and a Chinese food centre, Violet Oon's Kitchen offers delicious authentic Peranakan fare. We never fail to go there each time we are in Singapore. We love the Dry Laksa, the Buah Keluak pasta, the Gado Gado and all the desserts!Their sunday brunches have become a regular family tradition, as there are items for every palate.: Brioche French Toast with Gula Melaka syrup, Roti Babi, Vietnamese Pulled Pork Burrito, and Crab Cake Benedict are some of our favourites! Don't forget to order Truffle Fries, and eat them piping hot
2
We came here with rather high expectations and were thoroughly disappointed. The dishes we ordered were on the salty end and does not mirror the usual Peranakan cuisine we had in other restaurants - perhaps as one of the waiters puts it "its a modern peranakan take". Service was prompt but the servers were listless and uninterested in providing a gd service - whenever we asked for chilli or serviette, they made us feel that they were doing us a huge favour. Overall a let down in what could have been a great restaurant

This is my ‘Place To Go’ for modern Singapore cuisine. Located along Bukit Timah Road, near Old Holland Road, you can get there easily if you are driving/ taking a cab.Violet Oon is Singapore’s very own ‘Celebrity Chef’ and has many a cook book written by her. With a restaurant, its now possible to eat food cooked according to her recipes.I came for dinner recently with my colleagues and were in for a treat. Here are the highlights of my meal:- Dry Laksa ($22): Fresh rice noodle tossed in Vio Laksa pesto with prawns, tau pok and bean sprouts. The dry version of the traditional laksa that you usually have. The sauce is thicker and creamier, and it was nice!- Buah Keluak Pasta ($24): This was my favourite, where you get Buah Keluak that’s been infused with spices, minced prawns, chilli padi and coconut milk tossed in with spaghetti. A modern fusion pasta that you must order!- Ngo Hiang ($15): Deep fried fresh prawn, crab meat, pork and water chestnut rolls seasoned with five-spice powder and wrapped in bean curd skin. The fillings were substantial and went well with the sweet sauce that came with the dish.- Tauhu Goreng ($15): Fried bean curd with julienne cucumber and bean sprouts topped with peanut sauce. The bean curd were nice. Wished the bean sprouts were cooked, so that they don’t taste raw.- Sambal Bendi ($9): Poached lady’s fingers in a spicy and tangy dried prawn floss paste. The prawn paste were slightly tangy and went well with the lady’s fingers. - Garam Assam Fish ($23): Spanish Mackeral fillets n a spicy and sour gravy with pineapple slices and lady fingers. I loved the sauce. Full of ‘rempah’ (spices) that you can taste with each spoonful of gravy. However, my dinner group finished all the fish before I could sample it… So have to try this next time. - Desserts- Pulut Hitam with Vanilla ice cream: Interesting addition of glutinous rice in the black glutinous rice made this dessert unique. It’s the modern version of the traditional hot pulut hitam that you find elsewhere. - Kuay Beng Kah (Tapioca Cake) with gula melaka and coconut cream: Traditional nonya kueh, that’s made into a cake and served as a slice. Served warm and drizzled with gula Melaka and coconut cream, it was divine!- Bread and Butter Pudding with Whisky and Custard Sauce: The first thing that ‘struck’ me was the whiff of whisky from the sauce which the bread and butter pudding was drenched with. The whisky and custard sauce gave the dish a whole different flavour, compared to the ones you have had before. The restaurant is done in a modern setting, and offers a great ambience and nice place to chill out with friends and family

Crew were quite attentive. However, 1st order was served wrongly. Vegetarian salad became chicken salad.My son's main course order was forgotten until everybody's mains have been served. It was another 30 mins later when everyone else have finished their mains & desserts were being served that his Asam fish dish finally arrived. Pricing on high side though. Est $45 per pax(incl 17%tax
3
We had a take away from this place while on a visit in early September 2014 and while the food was good it did not live on in the memory except the Beef Randang which two of our party really enjoyed. I would rate this as an average experience
4
The service was excellent! Kueh pie tee was so-so but curry was good. Black/white decor is nice - like the bar top :)
1
Went for brunch and waited over an hour from when one person received their food to the last person ( table of four) received their food. The bathrooms were disgusting and when highlighted this to the staff, they did nothing!
3
Any restaurant is about the food. They serve Peranakan food and fusion peranakan bistro food, On the menu are Vietnam pulled pork burrito, brioche something or other. 6 locals decided to rate the classics, first tastingngoh hiong - goodkueh pie tee - goodmeatball soup - prawn soup is good though not quite bakwan kepitingchicken buah keluak - below averagegado gado- acceptableBabi Pong teh - acceptablechap chye- acceptablefusion chili crab pizza - good thin crust, crab and cheese good, but sauce is too sweetdry laksa - goodThe Best- sambal belachan - this is a chilli and prawn paste with lime. Maybe an acquired taste, this was very good!Truffle fries were good too, but already slightly soggy when brought to the tabledesserts - "everything too sweet"pulot hitam- beans may be trying for crunch or firmness but did not quite make it, and our expert deemed better to have coconut ice cream than vanilla ice cream which masked flavor.bebingka- good but too little coconut milk served with it.durian chendol panna cotta - too sweet and too rich, almost hard to swallow, does need ice to dilute itbread and butter pudding - goodAll portion sizes good.Bottled beer etc are well, fine, but my mojito was the worst I've ever had. It tasted like a mild mint drink with hint of lemon, hardly any lime fragrance, could taste no alcohol and was expensive.The place is chic "black and white bistro" - so decor is fine. 2 common problems - when it is full, feels crowded and very noisy so larger groups have trouble enjoying each others company. Platters too large, always having to "re-arrange"."Pricey" for these dishes so our verdict is- "it's ok" to "not good enough for the price". We wonder if it could make it in Katong Peranakan heartland?Service was good. Heartwarming to see Violet herself looking well
4
We find Violet Oon’s Kitchen a great place to bring visitors to try some original Peranakan food. The weekend brunch in particular is a favourite with lots of different options at a reasonable price. There’s also a selection of western food for those who prefer. It’s a great place to try something authentically Singaporean, and chef/owner Violet Oon herself is a famous ‘Food Ambassador’ apparently
3
The food is good - fusion interpretations of Nyonya dishes (buah keluak pasta, back pepper prawn pasta, etc) or individual-sized Nyonya dishes (thus not everybody in your party needs to share if only you want to have, say, tauhu goreng or beef rendang). Not the best, but pretty good - more for exploration than degustation. Relaxed ambience. Long drinks menu. Service is friendly but a bit slow (and there were only 4 occupied tables when we came!) Given the prices, more a place for expats
3
Fabulously laid-back, well-designed space and friendly, helpful staff willing to go the extra mile were definitely highlights of this small restaurant, super-busy on a Saturday night. Drinks - from an extensive cocktail list - were well-made and generous. These impressions made an excellent start, and I immediately began planning my next visit to try their brunch. However, the food didn't quite live up to the promise of this auspicious beginning. I'm going to try them again, because it really was a busy evening and we were on a big table meaning the kitchen probably got slammed. We shared entrees and the 'meatless meatballs' were tasty in a rich sauce; the tofu with bean sprouts was light and delicious and the salad was well-assembled. But my main of chicken lemak was not so good. The coating sauce was both quite tasteless and quite oily and the pieces of chicken served off the bone (to cater for ang moh preferences?) were dry and somehow tasted slightly of fish, which was really disconcerting as you can imagine. Accompanying sambal was good, however, and the sweet sharpness of the pickled vegetables made the chicken more palatable. Servings are generous. We'll give it another try .... and can I say again, the staff were really top-notch
5
This was exactly the Singaporean restaurant I've been searching for. Local, delicious food, beautifully presented without any fuss. A relaxed environment and a lovely ambience where food is always the focus. Lovely cocktails, good wine list ... and incredibly reasonable prices. I can't stop thinking about the peanut sauce that was served with the bean curd. The best ever
5
We have searched for some time to find a really good place to enjoy a relaxed brunch since arriving in Singapore, this is by far the best we have come across, really good venue, attentive service, and a traditional brunch menu with some great Asian twists and signature dishes. totally recommend the frozen raspberry margaritas if you don't fancy tequila with brunch the mint lychee smoothie is also awesome. this is now our brunch venue of choice, great value, just a real find, we love it
2
The food and the service were disappointing on my recent visit. My salad was like rabbit food, with large amounts of lettuce, chicken chopped into tiny cubes, and a tasteless vinaigrette. My friend was unhappy with her choice - the beef rendang, which was was fatty and bland. The service was poor and infuriatingly slow. Overall a disappointment
3
Dined here for lunch with friends on a Tuesday lunchtime. The place was empty so no atmosphere. The staff were hanging around with nothing to do but we still had to ask to place our order. The smoothie was very good. The food was average and the price was slightly higher than it was worth. I'm sure this place is better at the weekends when the crowds arrive for the famous brunch but on this occasion I felt it was lacking. Also, not all options were available on the menu so we were limited. Maybe we went on an off day?
4
Took a friend to this place for a surprise birthday dinner.It was a wonderful dining experience. I loved the decors. I loved the food. The dry laksa was a unique culinary treat. My favourite though was the pulot hitam. :) The best I've ever tasted.Will definitely be back
4
You may like Peranakan food or not, if you go to violet Oon's Kitchen you will definitely find something on the menu you will like. If you are not sure, "the son" is coming to help you. The restaurant is not in the poshest of places of Singapore, but that makes it the even more lovable place to be. Don't miss it, it is worthwhile
4
This is a bistro style nyonya restaurant - the cocktail, the Sunday brunch, the casual mood, the fusion menu, the service. The menu has some serious nyonya dishes. It has some of the common nyonya dishes like Ayam Buah Keluak, beef rendang etc, and some unique ones like dry laksa and mee siam. The nyonya food here can probably rival the best nyonya restaurants in town. The place is a little cramp but has a nice casual vibes. Service was fast and to the point. The restaurant manager was fantastic whom made an exceptional effort to seat the 10 of us on a busy Sunday lunch. We had an enjoyable lunch
3
We were recommended this cozy local restaurant from friends who have been many times. The prices are very reasonable by Singapore standards and so is the wine. 3 of us had the pepper prawn pasta which was a little heavy on the pepper and one of us had the beef briskit which was delicious and even a little too big portion size. The food choice was a little limited and we struggled to find a dish we were comfortable with. It was cozy home style food which was a nice change in Singapore. The service was excellent and the ambience of the restaurant was really nice
5
Went in a group of 6 and ordered 6 mains to share. On hindsight, should have ordered 4 or 5 instead as the portions are big. Overall faves were Babi Pong Tay, which is the most tender and yummy stewed pork belly with flavorful sauce, and the Beef Rendang, which is a spicy meat stew. The latter was very tasty, with lots of sauce and huge chunks of beef. We also ordered the Angus Beef Burger and Fries, which were okay, nothing special, but it wasn't a bad burger. Meat was juicy, but I noticed the staff didn't ask what doneness we wanted for the burger. ViO's Shepherd Pie was pretty good, a nice change from all the liberally spiced food we ordered. Dish took a little long to arrive but it came piping hot from the oven! We ordered the Buah Keluak Chicken, which I felt was a bit of a letdown as the meat itself was on the dry side, though the sauce was tasty. It came with 2 buah keluak nuts that you can use a fork or knife to dig out the morsels inside. Hate it or love it, the nut is worth at least a try.My least favorite of the night was the Pulled Beef Ragu Rigatoni. The menu red that it was stewed in red wine but my overwhelming impression was just of salt. The dish was too salty and even the generous amount of rigatoni couldn't help to distract from that. On another note, the restaurant has 2 seatings, perhaps only on weekends, I'm not too sure. The first starts at 6pm and the second at about 8pm. I was not informed of that when making the reservation so my party was due to arrive at 7, and got caught in a traffic jam, so arrived only at 7.30pm or so. I checked with the manager on duty and he actually called the arriving tables to see if there were any last minute cancellations so that we could hold the table a little longer! Good service indeed.Another staff worthy of mention was a relatively young Chinese guy who helped us to double check our orders, assisted with inquiries on the desserts etc. He, along with the manager, good food and great service, left my party with a good impression, and all I could hear from them after was how they all wanted to come back again. Great tasting food very often results in thirst after due to the liberal amount of MSG seasoning added, but even hours after the meal, we were all very happy with the meal, with no thirst resulting~Good job

Violet herself was at the restaurant when we dined here and helped us order. Two colleagues and I ate our way through around a dozen dishes and they were all fantastic. The location is away from big hotels and there is a smaller, personal feel about the place. Beyond that, there is no pretense, just great food, well matched wines, and exotic flavors. Singapore is a location of NY wannabe restaurants and to go to a place which specializes in native foods with comfortable but not overblown service and scale was a complete relief and delight. And Violet was a joy to interact with. I doubt she is there all the time, I think she is a celebrity of sorts in Singapore, so I felt fortunate to have her there and helping us. Loved the place, will head back
5
The menu had several interesting Western and Asian dishes. We settled for the Indo-Malaysian. We started with pita with chili crab and the black nut dip. Both dip were very good. The black nut apparently was poisonous if not prepared properly. We were reassured that we were the second to eat on that day and the other group was still alive.Next was the Ngohiang (5-spice fried meat roll). It was tasty but a bit oily from the frying. My mom used to cook her version.For mains we shared the beef rendang and the black nut chicken curry. Both were good. I loved the beef rendang. Meat was tender and the sauce quite flavorful. My friend liked the chicken curry as it tasted similar to a Mexican dish.I plan to be back
4
Like many previous reviewers, the plus points were:- the really interesting menu that made one think really hard what to order- the fabulous setting/decor/ambience- staff that seemed genuinely pleasant- food that is pretty good overallSome minuses that I am willing to overlook:- angus burger was good and juicy, but probably not great enough for me to want to order everytime (like Morton's and Hard Rock Cafe)- the meatless meatballs appetizer were a tad too salty and we didnt finish it- the honey calamansi drink tasted like water, they might have missed the honeyAll in all though, there is still something special about the place that makes me want to return quickly for a second try
4
I went for dinner on a Saturday night. The place was pretty packed - both inside and outside. The ambience is cozy and casual. The service was friendly and good although a bit slow. The menu is really interesting and it took a while to decide what to have. I ended up with the dry laksa, which was a great choice. Really well made and very tasty. Prices are reasonable so overall good value for money. Definitely a place to recommend for a night out with family and friends

I visited this restaurant after reading that Violet Oon is like the Julia Child of Singapore. The menu is so amazing looking it took us a long time to decide what to order. We settled on pita with dips, tofu goring, followed by pork belly and a fusion Asian style black nut pasta with minced prawns and coconut milk. The menu seems to have taken traditional dishes and updated them, without sacrificing flavour. The dips were amazing. One was made from a tree nut which I had never tasted before, delicious. The other was a chili crab, again yum. The fried tofu came with a delicious red chilli sauce, bean prouts and cucumber. the flavours complemented each other beautifully. My partner's pork belly braise was melt in your mouth, served with rice and crispy salad. My main of pasta was lovely but as it had the same nut- base as one of our dips I would probably choose differently next time. Unfortunately we were too full fr dessert - I am going to try one next time! The restaurant is in a traditional black and white shop front style. Beautiful decor. So,highly recommended. As I will be moving to Singapore in a couple of months I imagine I will be heading here regularly

Paranakan food prepared in a special way thats just so nice. The food is rich and yet u will finish it all, without feeling that its too much. Good service makes it all even better. Make reservation to avoid disappointment.

A colleague was leaving the company and at her request, our group of office sloggers organised a send-off at this restaurant. Located along the always busy Bukit Timah Road, parking is a problem, so don't drive if you can help it. The restaurant has a cosy mix of indoor and outdoor seating. One of the reasons for coming here could be the owner of the self-named establishment who made her name as a foodie contributor to local newspapers and as the writer of several cookbooks. She was there that night, entertaining a number of diners in small groups. The other main attraction would be the food, an interesting combination of traditional Peranakan (or Straits-born) dishes, instantly recognisable by folks of this ethnic persuasion, and more western dishes made in a fusion sort of way. Being a Peranakan myself, I have to claim my mum's cooking to be more authentic. But I certainly enjoyed the roti jala - something I've missed for many years - it had a generous portion of chicken korma but not enough of the net-like roti, and the kueh pie tee although I thought the prawns were a little raw. I introduced my friends to ayam buah keluak and, as expected, most of them found the nut an acquired taste. They did really like the ikan tempra with its killer sauce. The staff were friendly and more than happy to make recommendations on portion size, whether a dish came with rice, or maybe a pairing with wine. Overall, worth another visit when the urge to gobble down Peranakan becomes significant enough or at least to introduce another bunch of friends to a cuisine they never knew they missed

If one wants a true taste of Nonya coooking - This is a must. It is well worth the trip to Bukit Timah Road. Violet is not only innovative but has done fusions pretty well, by keeping the authentic Nonya taste in her entrees. Kudos to Ms. Oon

We went for the Mother's Day Buffet and had a lovely time! The Peranakan food was of course absolutely delicious - I loved the tender and fragrant beef rendang, chicken pong tay and ngo hiam. They also served 'free flow' of Kueh Pie Tee. All the dishes were rich and flavoursome, and the desserts were delicate and bite sized so you didn't feel like too 'gelat' (or overly full of rich of food). The service was also very prompt, efficient and discrete. They would collect our plates quickly, refill water, etc. Very unexpected in Singapore! Overall this is one of the must-trys in Singapore, and we can't wait to go back to try their ala carte menu

Violet Oon's Kitchen is in Bukit Timah, about 20 minutes by taxi from the Marina Bay area and well worth the trip. The menu includes western and Peranakan dishes wonderfully prepared and served. Even though we were eating there on the very busy night before Easter the service was excellent. The staff are helpful in helping you select from the varied menu. A meal at Violet's is the perfect opportunity to try new dishes. The staff were also very helpful in arranging for a taxi back to our hotel at the end of our meal. It is a very good idea to have reservations as the recent excellent New York Times review will serve to further increase the Kitchen's popularity

As other reviewers have mentioned, the food is delicious. We shared many of the Peranakan dishes and three of the desserts, and everything was wonderful. The restaurant has a nice ambiance, and the service is some of the best we've had in Singapore. Violet came by our table to say hello and make recommendations. The staff came asked how the food was, refilled water glasses, brought napkins, etc. Violet seems to be setting a new, higher service standard in Singapore

We had such a great time at this lovely restaurant last night. Though there were western selections on the menu, we opted for the nyonya cuisine and were not disappointed. The dry laksa was a major hit. Do not pass it up. Next, we shared a black nut chicken, which was better tasting and better priced than any of the other peranakan restaurants in Singapore. Really nice gravy and big nuts. The beef rendang was a treat as well. Served with a gorgeous cone of yellow rice. Really rich and well spiced. Finally, her curry chicken was worthy of the notice it recieved in the New York Times. Nyonya curry is different from any other--and the lace pancake was delightful. We also ordered the bindi and chap chay for sides. I felt like the sambals were all made by hand in mortar and pestle. Best of all, Violet came over and helped us order! We had a nice visit and felt like we had met a local celeb. I plan to buy her cookbook next time I am at Kino, and will def take a cooking class from her next time it's offered. Desserts were great, so were cocktails. Well priced as well, compared to other restaurants in Singapore. (ESP overpriced peranakan places like true blue). Enjoy!

I was a colleague of Violet's when we both worked for a newspaper in Singapore. I was lucky enough to have been invited for meals at her home a couple of times. They were superb. For a variety of reasons, I had not been able to dine at her pervious forays into the restaurant businesss so I made a special effort to go to her latest incarnation of her eatery. I was not disappionted.VOK is not your typical Peranakan restaurant in which you order a variety of dishes to be shared, The menu is more akin to a Western restaurant with appetisers/starters, entrees/mains, side dishes and desserts. It does make meals more expensive but if you want cheap, you will need to go else where. That said, the food, service and ambience are worth the money.Four of us dined there this week and we tried the dips of buak keluak and crab sambal. The former was a hit but It was hard to taste the crab in the latter. We had ayam buah keluak, babi pong teh and ngo hiang with a side of sambal bendi. The main courses came with rice and a ramekin of pickles. As the table was getting crowded we dispensed with some side plates and put the main dishes in the middle to be shared.The buak keluak and babi pong teh passed muster but the ngo hiang and sambal bendi were outstanding. The ngo hiang was nicely crisped without being over-fried, which can kill the subtle flavours of the dish, and the ladies fingers were done just right and went well with the sambal.VOK features some dishes not found in traditional Peranakan eateries and Violet is to be commended to daring to break out of what could be a traditionalist straightjacket. While the pulot hitam with ice-cream was a little pedestrian the bubor cha cha panna cotta was so good that another serve was considered. And we would have had we not been quite full by then.One especially notable feature was the excellent service; the waitstaff were attentive but never intrusive. It is hard to find this level of service these days.The only hiccough was that we had booked online but they had no record of the reservation. Someone had forgotten to check the email.Subsequent visits are on the cards

Finding a good (local) restaurant in the bukit timah has been a head-scratching experience for me. I am glad there is one that I can regularly go to/recommend to my friends. The babi ponteh and nyoh hiang are definitely worth every single dollar (more the pricey end but with an AMEX card - 50% off if dining with another - woo hoo!) Parking is easy as I could easily find a lot near the private estate behind it

I'm a big fan of Peranakan food and expected a more Asian offering here. The Ngor Hiang is a great starter - sizable for 2 to share, and crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. It came with a lightly tossed salad. Having read so much about the pulled beef ragu ragatoni I had to try one. It didn't disappoint. A tad heavy on the seasoning, but portions are large enough to be shared. Service was uneven. When my group first arrived they were very good at settling us in, getting water and sharing the specials of the day. Food arrived pretty quickly too. However, service went quiet towards the end of the meal. Water glasses took a while to be topped up, and having given us the dessert menu, we were left until a member of our party decided to walk up to the bar with our orders.Pricey, but you get good quality here. Pity about the service though
