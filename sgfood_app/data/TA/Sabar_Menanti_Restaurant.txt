They have varieties of Malay dishes. From rendang to barbeque fish. The service is good and great food. Would recommend any loving Malay food to go to this place.

Had a great lunch today at Sabar Menanti at the North Bridge Road side. We haven't been to this restaurant for quite some time, the food just as delicious as ever. Also bought a number for dishes home for dinner. Great for breakfast and lunch.

Came here with high hopes of a flavor packed meal knowing Bourdain ate here. Don’t waste a precious rumbly tummy here when you have so many options. The rice was dry and bland. Seriously so bland. It’s not even worth discussing anything else on the plate when you can’t get past the rice.

Note that this review is for Sabar Menanti II, on Victoria Street.The restaurant is located in a shop house almost directly across from the Masjid Sultan. There is a selection of Malay dishes from which to choose. At breakfast time lontong and nasi lemak are also available.The food is very good and reasonably priced. The serving staff are polite. Well worth a visit for Singaporean Malay food

The food here is still so so good after so many years. It's authentic Padang food and you can eat a hearty meal here (together with a glass of coffee or tea) for less than SGD10. It is more of mamak style restaurant setting and it is all about good food and efficiency in service. Love it and will be back

Upon returning to Spore after 12 years staying overseas, decided to head for one of my favourite Malay delcacies in Arab Street.Had Nasi Padang and expecting the flavorful Rendang, Sambal Tumis, Lodeh, Belado and many more. My friends and I were a little disappointed with the quality of food. We were informed, the cooks were different. I guessed the same for the other popular local Restaurant in Spore. It is not the same anymore

Nice end lot restaurant, nothing fancy about the restaurant ambience but food was good. Limited seating area, so be early, the tables shuffle early anyway if you wait. Many competitors around the area with larger variety but the food selection here has the most basic dishes for classic nasi Padang. Overall all the dishes were good, safe bet in the area. Fried chicken 4 starsSambal beef lungs 4 starsSambal Squid 3 stars Fried fish 3 stars Fried whole fish 3 starsFriend potato cutlets - 3 stars

Sabar Menanti II on north bridge road is a small, quiet and cozy place frequented by locals. We tried the combo meals supplemented by rose flavoured tea and it was delicious. The food portion was quite generous too.We enjoyed the experience of eating lunch with the local people.Would definitely visit again

Perhaps the best eating places in Singapore on a parity "price - quality". At the reception, you can dial a plate of rice, and then to put it any main dish: curry of jackfruit (breadfruit), spicy chicken in coconut sauce, a variety of grilled fish, shrimp in chili sauce. The price depends on the weight of the dish

Today, I decided to forego briyani for Malay cuisine. Haven't had lontong since Raya and naturally, chose that over dishes.The lontong came in a fashionably appealing appearance. I told myself looks can be deceiving but at the first sip of the gravy, gosh!!... it was delicious; not too thick and creamy. I continued with the serunding, egg and sambal. Perfect! Everything goes well together. Oh! I had begedil added too. A plate of lontong with begedil costs $4. Reasonably priced. A place that I would come back for my lontong fix. Btw, the opor nangka is a must try - the fruit is well cooked and you can taste the myriad of spices in that dish.

The dishes in Sabar Menanti is delicious but that is average and a lot more Melayu/Indonesian restaurant giving the same.
You can reach Sabar Menanti Restaurant from MRT Nicoll Highway Station. Walk 400m and you'll found Kandahar Street

Had a business lunch here. It was fun but very slow. I loved the ambience of the restaurant and the care the staff took of us and the food however the food itself was a let down.
1
Their signature dish is Nasi Padang. Very popular in Malaya and Indonesia.
However the quality of the food, the service and the atmosphere leaves much to be desired.
Best go elsewhere.

I've been to and tasted many nasi padang in Singapore and this is the best so far. My personal favourite is nasi sambal goring and nasi ambeng.

Bought nasi sambal goreng recently. Food was undeniably yummy and a bit pricey at $6. One malay lady at the counter who was serving food to customers was extremely impolite. Had informed her to serve moderate amount of rice and chilli. When my food was served, I realized that my rice was like a mountain and the amount of chilli was too much. When approached, I was told off by her. Will never come again as there are other places around North Bridge Road that serves better food, at better prices and good staff

Visited this eating house and had a delicious lunch packed full of flavour and was as authentic as authentic could be.The Rendang, Sotong, Lemak, Fish and Achar were lip smacking good!Loved the lady who sat in a corner totting up the bill, how's that for ambience.Get there before the lunchtime crowds arrive and you will be able to find seating.Will definitely return without a shadow of a doubt.Terima Kasih Sabar Menanti

We were recommended to the Padang food here and from then on, we always stick to this place! The set lunch of $5 is good with one meat and two vegetables. We always come slightly earlier to beat the lunch queue. Love the ayam and ikan here but sometimes the nasi is a bit too hard for me. If we have visiting Indonesian friends, we will bring them here. The staff sometimes must be working very hard as we would appreciate them to smile mor

I'm Indonesian and I know how good taste of original Padang Food from my country. I've tried many Padang Food in Singapore, but this restaurant cooks padang food with taste most likely Indonesia original Padang Food. Even though the original cooked from Indonesia still better.Ok it could be more spicy and sweat for non-Indonesia people. But if you wanna taste the most likely, this is it. And if you a traveller from Indonesia and really miss the taste of Indonesia, come to this restaurant

My staff love Sabar, but it doesnt do it for me. The food is too salty with too much fat. This is classic Singapore Malay food. I prefer it a lot more refined.Location is good but the staff can be a bit stiff some times. can be hard to get a smile out of them

My recent visit here was my second. The Padang selection of dishes are quite standard, it's just a matter of where has a bigger variety & tastier dishes.Since I was in the area & wanted something 'safe', I opted for this place. Unlike the Padang way of serving in some places (where various dishes are placed at your table & you pay for only what you eat), here, you select the dishes you want & they'll be sent to your table. I fortunately arrived just before the lunch hour crowd & was able to browse & select my dishes in a leisurely manner.The 'aunties' & 'uncles' who manage the place, despite being rather busy, were very friendly & obliging which made my dining experience here all the more pleasant. On both occasions I had eaten my meals at the few tables available downstairs but they also have a bigger (I presume air conditioned) dining area upstairs.The price is OK & the 'pay-before-you-eat' system is much easier as you can just up & leave when you're done
