I have tried this place before. Just didn't know the dish was called bak chor mee. Really good dish. Little spicy but not at the level that you can't enjoy the flavor. It contains meatball, fish ball, squid ball, fish cake, minced meat, mushrooms and various spices, over noodles. The dish comes with a bowl of hot soup. I recommend the mee kia noodles (round, thin) over the mee pok (flat)

This is a must try bak Chor Mee! They served bak Chor Mee with fish ball , they used whole chicken to make the soup which is delicious! You need to Q for at least 1/2 hour but it remains my favorite bak Chor Mee !
