We came here for desserts and coffee but surprisingly, the coffee was not good. Maybe will try their breakfast or food menu next time.
4
The coffee is very good - the milk is for reason, extremely smooth. On weekends, you basically have a all-day breakfast menu.
We had the trio sausage & eggs and the French toast with banana & chocolate. Both of which are recommended.
4
Ordered different pastas. Taste good and the portion is just right. Also had their cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert. Taste yummy too.
4
We couldn't choose for the coffee art.
It was quite disappointed.
Maybe for the complicated design, reservation is needed. But we didn't being told so.
The service is nice anyway.
5
Best sausage l have ever eaten in Asia!
Service is nice and friendly, all food were just perfect. Those small things like a perfect toast. They were our of stock for Stella Artois..
5
This caf√© has wonderful service and fantastic food. Eggs of any kind - they have some creative benedicts - muesli, fruits, local dishes. The coffees are lovely and some come with elaborate yummy decorations! Good prices, fast and friendly service.
4
I had the portobello mushroom Benedict. Delicious and can out quickly. Of course I had to see what sort of art came with my latte. I got a cute kitty. Definitely a fun stop after jet lag.
4
The ambiance and the food ia juat perfect for an afternoon tea..will recommend this place and definitely will be going back for more..
4
We visited the cafe for lunch and my girlfriend was very keen to see the 3D latte art. I only went for a long black and a pasta, which both were nice. Perhaps for what I ordered, the price was a little steep, but if you come specifically for the 3D thing then, I guess it is all worth it. Have to say, their cakes looked delicious but we were already quite full at that point
4
We went back to Chock Full of Beans after the hype of the coffee art for the iced coffee drinks. We ordered a prawn salad, blueberry bagel, eggs benedict, Banana pancakes for food. Drinks we had iced chocolate, rose latte and iced earl grey latte. Food deserves a thumbs up! Especially the bagel (coz, I love bagels!), could smell the blueberry and the bagel is served hot with smooth cream cheese and fresh fruits with a sprinkle of icing sugar. Rose latte is a good size and is full of flavor.... The coffee art is super! Insta-worthy...Worth a visit even when it is so far out
4
We found this place after returning from a morning trip to Pulau Ubin. Was perfect for a bite and drink on a rainy afternoon. Pasta and sandwiches were nice. Free Wifi also handy
4
tuck in a quiet corner is a cafe named Chock Full of Beans. its latte art are amazing. one wouldn't mind waiting for 15mins for your cup of coffee.
4
The place atmosphere are really chilling & peace. My sisters really love the coffee art done by the staff :)
3
Waiting for a ferry to go to Pulau Ubin can be done while enjoying a nice coffee
Designs on the cup are fun and creative, coffee is good, outside seating area is relaxing
... just wish service was more reactive
Enjoy!
5
I would recommend visiting just to get a coffee, although the food was good too. The designs are very impressive! Staff were friendly. Service was very prompt.
1
Wish their pasta was better, in terms of flavour. The rice set was pretty bad too, coffee though cute wasn't that good.
3
This is basically a coffee store offering a very tasty breakfast. It was particularly comfortable for Westerners. The service was prompt and friendly.
5
Lazy Sunday afternoon Tea? This will be the nice place to go to. Tucked away in the Eastern corner of Singapore island known as Changi Village. Long black coffee is what they are good for and their cakes are fantastic! Service level is quite high with the all Singapore local crew. Only setback is their small indoor sitting which can only shelter a maximum of 20 persons from the blaring heat of Singapore weather.

We had brunch here one Saturday morning ... the food was nice but the coffee was superb :) Not only did it look good but it tasted beautiful (I like strong coffee, my wife likes weak lattes and we both rated it 10 out of 10)
5
We've been to this wonderfully tucked away cafe a couple of times before. Brought the kids to celebrate my daughter's 11th birthday last Friday. Checked out with the cafe staff on the phone during reservations if they had an unicorn cake or rainbow cake as my daughter's currently observed with unicorns. The staff politely responded that they had neither. We went to the cafe regardless and had an awesome carbonara, crab meat tomato cream pasta & portobello benedict. We ordered a slice of Oreo cheesecake for dessert & was wondering what took them so long to serve the cake when all they had to do was to retrieve it from the display cabinet. 5 minutes later, the cake was served with a wonderfully crafted unicorn art on the serving plate along with a candle on top of the slice Oreo cake. The surprise was definitely the icing on the cake for our little birthday celebration
4
Had eggs atlantic and it was decent and satisfying. Also ordered the white choc matcha but wasn't really to my liking.
5
Great coffee and food, with staff accommodating to our requests to the coffee art characters that we wanted. Thank you very much!
4
I have been there several times for brunch. It is nice and affordable. However, the pasta is not that great.
5
Great place for hanging out with friends and family. Food is nicely portion and taste great. Value for money.
5
Nice cafe in the east. Been here since they opened. Good place to come and chill. Nice food and coffee.
4
Their coffees and chocolate drinks are pretty awesome. Mushroom soup was good, pasta and eggs benedict were ok. Was disappointed that desserts were only available after 2:30pm. At noon, the place was quite warm although we sat indoors. Maybe it was just a humid day.
5
Nice cosy place. Food are excellent. Been there 4 times and satisfied with all orders.. 3D coffee art is cute too. Must try.
4
I requested for a snorlax as pokemon was in the trend back in August and I got a nice drawing of a 2d snorlax for my drink! The hot chocolate drink was also nice.
5
They have interesting coffee art work... Not to mentioned their coffee is really tasty too. But not for the food... not much of choices and not much of a flavour.
4
Coffee lover / Cutie lover/ cute stuff lovers / photo siao / selfie nuts will all love this place. with its new internal design, just made is scored more points on top of the food and coffee they serve. tips for new comers, if you want 3D coffee art choose iced coffee flavour other wise 2D coffee art for hot coffee. food wise is good too, with its wide range of sandwiches and pasta. Sorry guys non halal spot.if you are in the extreme east do visit them . perfect for a lazy sunday after a cycle trip to ubin
5
Loved the food service was efficient I felt welcome and the atmosphere is buzzing always a nice place to stop. Loved the pancakes my kids shared a plate. (Aged 10 and 7) coffee is goooood!
4
Nice place for a cup of cappuccino or other drinks. The barista makes very nice pictures even on the cream. The ssandwiches are perfect nice place to have a Saturday afternoon
3
Their coffee art is still amazing as ever although mine doesn't really look good this time as compared to my previous visit. Should have told them which art I wanted else you will get random characters üò≠
4
Love the coffee here. The best in singapore. We also had lunch and though the selection is limited but the food is good.
4
We headed there specially for the cute 3d pokemon latte that they had! It was adorable! The brunch set we had with poached eggs was not bad as well.
4
Food was ok,abit pricey,service staff were friendly,3d art was nice,the kids love it. This was my 5th visit
5
Coffee was excellent with really cute latte art. We also ordered the veggie wrap and beef mash which were delicious.
4
Spent about S$15 for the Salmon Alantic set, -poached eggs,toast,side salad,smoked salmon, with a drink (Lemon tea/Sparkling strawberry -its the one I drank! )
When its about 1pm or so , its much more crowded and I went on a Weekday.
5
Wow! This place is amazing and thanks so much to Trip Advisor because with you, we wouldn't have known about it! The lava cake was the best my daughter had ever tasted (and that's ALOT of lava cakes!) and the 3D art on the iced coffees was so brilliant.
5
Ok i've got to say this: The main reason I decided to go to this cafe was because I Googled "3d latte art singapore". And this place was the first location that came up. Saw a few of the really cool looking latte art designs and thought to myself: hey, how bout I bring that girl I like to the restaurant so she'll have a nice insta worthy cup of coffee? Guess what.. She agreed!(To go to the cafe obviously)And so off we went. Carpark was affordable and very near the cafe (so that's good). I had a BLAT sandwich, which was really tasty! I really like how the bacon was crispy.. So if you like your bacon crispy, you know where to go. She had herself eggs benedict. That was really amazing too. I mean.. When the eggs(they were poached eggs) arrived.. I loved how when I shook the table the eggs would just wobble as if the whites were just a thin layer and ready to burst at any time. We also ordered some bangers and mash (no banging or mashing for me yet tho, she's not my wife yet) which was basically hot dogs(sausages I mean) and potatoes. I loved the mashed potato, it was fluffy! I have no idea how to review food but I gotta say.. It was good. Definitely value for money! If value for money is cafe pricing (and not coffee shop pricing)If that girl I brought does become my girlfriend in the future.. I'll be bringing her back here! During that time I'll follow up with a review called: Chock full of... love (in our hearts
4
Chick full of Beans is always a nice place to visit for a Saturday brunch. I was biking and stopped for a lunch break and the Salmon sandwich was very nice.
I always enjoy the fun faces on the coffee stings.
4
Made a reservation for 2. Arrived at restaurant and table was given to someone else. It seems like the person also made a reservation with same name. Luckily a table was given to me quite immediate.
5
Meal was nicely done especially with the 2&3D art on their drinks which my Monster love it! This is my 3rd or 4th visit to the place, will drop by again
5
Dinner with friends on a Friday night. Food and service was good cum plenty of pokemon to catch while eating.
4
Now this place was an instagram find for me...yes I really do look everywhere before going to a place and stumbled upon their 3D coffee video and knew my trip to SIngapore would be incomplete without visiting this cafe. Though I was staying in Orchard and this place is a bit off in Changi Village,it's worth a visit if you have time on your hands. So since I wanted to try the 3D coffee art in particular, they have a selection of coffees that's possible on. I tried an iced hazelnut latte with a hello kitty on top and boy was it good! I'm a sucker for hazelnut and this one had such a nice and distinct flavour of it. They also do a lot of fancy latte art. I didn't really try the food so can't comment on that but with a super cup of coffee, I left this cafe a very happy girl indeed
3
The latte art is unique to this cafe. It accommodates the Pok√É¬©mon craze in its cuppa. It also captures the heart of the instagrammers with their food palate. Brunch options were adequate and nothing unique from cafes. The prices are similar to other cafes, food quality is reasonable but price is on the steep side for simple items like pancakes. The staff are attentive while trying to get your order, but they are also quick to chase you out when you are done to make room for more business opportunities. Definitely not a place to chill and catch-up
1
This is the first and only feedback that owns my negative 5 stars. We went there for a break after pokemon hunting. Its was crowded with pokemon trainers but we waited. Within minutes with more than half a dozen of staff walking across our faces, no one answered us even when we called out to them. There isn't a single 'wait a moment' or nodd, just rolled eyes and treated us like invisible and ignored us like plague. My patience partner was fuming over the rolled eyes n #pretendtobedeaf. There's no respect from them at all.If your a tourist visit this cafe at your own risk, you don't want to stain your holiday with barbarian services. We have other superb places. If you're local, I salute your humblest for visiting them.
4
Very cute 3D latte art designs, and good coffee too! I've always gone for the mocha as its chocolatey, rich and not too milky...Plenty of pokemons to catch for those into Pokemon Go! For those who are not into coffee, they've also got these cute hibiscus drink with a bear shaped jelly floating in it...Very affordable prices, loads cheaper than Starbucks and loads better quality coffee
2
Came around 945am, got a table easily. Al fresco tables are set a little too close together. Patrons who came later had trouble going to their tables. 3D lattes only for cold drinks and upon request. Coffee quality is ok, not super fantastic. Then again, with 3D latte they use more foam and it affects the taste probably? Bagels took 45 minutes to come. The worst part it was cold. I don't mind paying for quality but the food was really bad. Service - hard to call staff over, gloomy faces, even when you smile at them or greet them you're faced with dole faces. They might not be well trained yet, noticed a few of them looking to a particular staff for instructions.Would only come back for the novelty of drinks. Service needs to be improve
4
Located at laid back Changi Village, this area has been a haunt for Poke hunters day and night. Dine al fresco to get better gps reception and catch your next poke monster whilst you dine. Visited only for breakfast n had cappuccino n eggs benedict.Opens 9am Saturday n 9.30am Sunday. Came consecutive weekends. Eggs ben were lovely 1st time around, eggs were just right soft runny- perfect!2nd time hollandaise sauce was too thick, like squeezed out of a bottle. Will definitely be coming back for their coffee and desserts.ps the barista does a nice 3-d foam art with your iced coffe
3
Food was slow & hollandaise sauce was too little for the egg benny. 3d drink was good (mocha and earl grey) but the art was damn bad. my 2nd time here and it has once again disappoint.
5
You can customise your 3d latte art for their selected cold latte. Or customise 2d latte art on their hot latte. Can refer to their instagram for ideas~
4
CFOB has always been a favourite lunch spot for me & my colleagues. The menu range has improved recently and we're always delighted with the coffee art we receive. CFOB also tries to adhere to our requests for characters.
5
Food nice, exspecially the latte 3D very nice cute and creative . Staffs all are friendly, they provide very good customer service . I will come again .
5
Was very impressed with the service and barista art work on my coffee(s) which I had here recently. Very friendly staff
5
In Changing village on stopover before flying home. Called into this cafe for breakfast. Good choice! Had scrambled eggs and toast, husband had pancakes--- all delicious and beautifully cooked, good coffee too!
4
I specially visited this place just so I can order a cute cup of coffee. The 3D art is only available for the selected iced coffees and they do very pretty coffee art on the hot ones too. While I was there I saw the barista creating a Pikachu coffee art. It's free of charge but during peak hours, you have to wait up to 30 mins. Go during non peak periods, I got mine within 10 mins. Coffee tasted ok
3
This place is famous for its 3D art drinks, but you need 30 minutes before getting the drink. You will get your drink with a very cute animal on the top, probably made of foam. Once you have finished your drink, the 3D art is left.The French Toast is good. Best if shared because it is a large, thick slice of bread.This place is packed on weekends. Wait patiently for a seat, then wait patiently for your order.
5
Late start on our final day in Singapore so missed the hotel breakfast. Had checked Chock Full of Beans on trip advisor so we took a short walk to try it out. We were not disappointed! Coffee latte art is a lovely touch. Mango smoothies are fresh and excellent. We all tried something different from the full breakfast to eggs benedict to pancakes. All were worth the wait. Home made bread to boot! If you are staying at hotel nearby this place is well worth a visit.
4
Great experience with the 3d Latte art which is only available for iced coffee. For the hot variety, unique latte art can also be expected with cute cartoon characters among many others. Food wise, prices are acceptable with decent quality food. The place is perpetually packed during weekends so do head down earlier to grab yourself a seat.
3
Food OK, price a big on the high side
Thou air-condition but the spotlights make the place too hot to sit for long
3
Perfect 3D coffee art as shown. Don't forget to request for the art! Hello kitty and cartoon characters are common requests to them!
Had carrot cake and portobello benediction.
Just order the drink and enjoy the attentive service.
4
European style cafe ove ring pasta dishes and very tasty sandwiches. Combo so you get a soft drink included. We had excellent BLAT. Good service from friendly staff.
4
Chock full of Beans is our half-way post on our regular weekend 80km bike ride from Tanglin to Changi and back and what keeps me going is wondering what my iced latte will look like! The first time I visited the great little cafe I had not idea what 3D latte art was when they asked if I wanted it - now my weekend wouldn't be complete without it√¢‚Ç¨¬¶.. makes me giggle every time. Apart from the novelty of foam creations Chock full of Beans gives a really good breakfast/brunch menu and lovely fresh OJ
4
I visited Chock Full of Beans for breakfast and ordered a decent plate of eggs benedict served on a portobello mushroom and toasted bread (the sesame seeds on the crust was a nice touch), but the draw of this place is definitely the awesome and adorable 3D latte art. For the 3D art to work you must order a cold drink, so I enjoyed a iced latte with a shot of Baileys topped with a really cute Hello Kitty foam. Make sure to tell your waiter/waitress what personalised 3D art you would like when placing your drinks order.The only thing that slightly spoiled the mood was to the immediate right of where I was sat (close to the window) there was a small pool of water forming on the seat from water dripping down the air conditioner right above and none of the staff members noticed this happening. Hopefully, that problem is fixed now. I would definitely return here again exclusively for the fantastic 3D latte art :)
5
Saw many negative reviews before heading down and was worried.However, the overall experience we had was fantastic! The food selection was pretty interesting, and the portion size was just right. The hazelnut latte was a tad too sweet, but the latte art was amazing! It was a pity i did not get a choice for the latte art. Service was good and fast! Loved it.. will return again
5
Loved the coffee! Pretty, cute n taste good.Unfortunately, can't say the same for the starters (nachos chips n cheese, smoked salmon on toast). These are almost like the stuff we make at home, no finesse.The salad we had (chicken salsa arrowheads) is good.The sausage dish is well done. The accompanying mashed potatoes is good. But the sauce is so starchy...it appeared lumpy. So, though tasty, the texture is poor
4
They have 3D art for some of their drinks, it's a plus pointThe quality of the food and drink will not make you crave for it but definitely edible and will satisfy your stomach for that one visitService is good, better than good actually.Overall, good visit and will come again when we're feeling romantic
4
Chockful is almost an hour's worth of travel from where I live but I do make the effort to travel from time to time. The food there is pretty average, especially for their pasta and other mains. I do like their sandwiches though. What really brings me back is the coffee. It was one of the first to come with 3D art but it tastes better than it looks. Watch out for the weekends though as it tends to get crowded and you may wait up to an hour if you are late
1
Located at Changi. Chock Full of Beans is closed on Mondays. Opening timing 11.30am, we were outside the cafe at 11.15am. There were staffs around us, yet they did not bother to introduce to us what they had in stall. They continued to ignore us until we asked them about the cafe. They told us that they only open at 11.30am and didn't have the initiative to present us with the menu until a guy, which seem like the boss, told us we could sit around and wait first. Reluctantly, they let us in and ignored us.When the food (Aglio Olio with Shrimps and Squid, Aglio Olio with Wild Mushrooms and Truffle) arrived, the first thing we realised is its oiliness and as we expected, its oil is dripping from the pasta and puddling on the bottom of the plate. Moreover the pasta is not done al-dente. Nothing on the plate goes well together, felt like they were cooked separately and then mixed together before serving it to us. Minimal effort given to the food. Would rate negative infinity. Coffee wise, not too bad. Cute latte art but the food had ruined it... Service was absolutely terrible. First of all, sugar was not served with the coffee and tea. When we requested for sugar, a staff was kind enough to pass us 2 sachets of white sugar without asking what type of sugar we wanted. When we ask her for 2 more sachets, she pointed to the counter and told us to take it ourselves even though the place was almost empty other than the couple beside us. Same thing happened to the couple who asked for a toothpick and was referred to OUTSIDE the cafe where he had to get it himself. I mean we would totally understand if the cafe was busy or something but no attention was paid to the customers at all. Overall, Food= Fail Service= Fail Ambience= Passabl
4
Found this place by chance and we were impressed! Good coffee (maybe not quite hot enough) with interesting cream designs (see my Sponge Bob picture). I can definitely recommend the Ultimate Swiss Rosti and the kids loved the huge waffles. Quick service was friendly too.
4
We went twice during our 3D2N staycation in the hotel nearby. Food is good and latte art makes us happy! But be prepare to wait for a long time if you are going in a big group..
5
The lovely smell of coffee hits you as you walk past.
A nice place for a pit stop with good coffee and excellent mango smoothies.
4
Friendly service, creative latte art and comfort food. Bagel was excellent and croissant was pleasantly crisp.
5
Only ate breakfast here. Views of swimming pool and Changi golf course. Restaurant is self service but waiting staff very helpful. Freshly cooked eggs and omelette available.
4
Dropped in for an evening meal. Staff were lovely and place was clean and welcoming. We had the pizza,s which were lovely - highly recommend them.
5
We go there for breakfast on the weekends, and it's fantastic. We stay about 5 mins down the road and this place serves a wonderful breakfast. They have a good variety of breakfast choices and drinks.It is popular with the locals and especially the cycling enthusiasts who are usually there after their morning workout
5
I was there on a weekday afternoon so it's less crowded. Other than the office lunch crowd, which wasn't much, the place was otherwise nice and quiet. The weekends are a different story altogether though. Overall, good place for a meal and catch up with friends over coffee with a creative twist.
3
We had passed by on Sunday and noticed quite a number of diners enjoying the brunch sets, so checked out their menus, which was quite interesting, particularly their coffees.We decided to come back for dinner a few days later. To our surprise, there was scaffolding and tarps all around, and the place was being renovated. We could not find any notice of when that would be completed, but certainly look forward to their new transformation
5
We were caught in a tropical storm and walked around the village looking for coffee. Most places did not meet European standards of hygiene: except Chock Full of Beans which was clean and well run. Iced coffee was good and strong. Sat for an hour until the rain stopped and the owners did not complain or move us on
4
Nice place with good services and reservation system. Clean. Organised. Feel relaxed not like some places where they can't wait for you to go. Accommodating staff who moved us from a hot area to a cool table. Thank you.
5
Basic menu and good location in Changi village, good value for Singapore with well presented and prepared food along with exceptional service, the staff try very hard to please with a great positive attitude
4
Awsome with 3D coffee, the food so nyummi....i went here for twice with kids and they're really love sosis n hot chocolate with 2D. My kids so picky choose foods but they love eat in this place.
4
The attraction of this place is the 3D latte. The
cakes and sandwiches are nice too. Lovely hang out place. Always love bringing friends here and see them WOW on the 3D latte.
5
Come here on a weekend and you'll be lucky to get a table. They do awesome latte art here and the ambience in the eastern corner of Singapore gives it a really laidback feel, we really enjoyed it here when we visited.
4
Been here so many times and the coffee is always amazing. If you like coffee art, they do very fantastic ones, with the use of milk froth and whipped cream. Food here is normal but it serves it's purposes. Overall, a great place to have coffee and chill out
4
We went to try this place on a weekday night, reserved beforehand as I saw the reviews that it's always crowded. We ordered the Linguine Aglio Olio with Prawns & Squids, Proscciuto Di Parma Pizza, Escargot stuffed mushrooms. For the 3D latte art, they only do it on iced lattes and not on hot drinks or iced matcha. It was awesome & lovely to see the 3D art, but it will start to sink and go out of shape after awhile even you don't stir it. So take your pic and enjoy the lovely art before it is gone.The linguine was great, a little spiciness from the chilli padi but acceptable. The prawns and squids given are generous and are quite decent in size. Pizza was nice too, parma ham with the cherry tomatoes and rockets/Arugula match well together. Just that the crust is a little too thick for my liking, the rest are decent. Escargot stuffed mushrooms are just fine, nothing impressive.It is near Tanah Merah Bus Interchange, just in front of it. If you are driving, just park at the carpark next to the bus interchange. CFOB is just located at the left corner of the shop houses, direct opposite the coffee shops
5
Very impressed with the cute 3D art done on the Iced Coffee !!! Cuteness overload !!!Food and service was good... Appreciate Chef humor and effort in the fine details of the food & drinks presentations !!!Well done !!! Ladies will definitely fall in love with the cute 3D art on the iced coffee !!
4
This is located in changi village which is about 30mins drive from downtown singapore. It does not have mrt access and you either take a taxi or mrt to the nearest mrt station and take a bus.The place is very popular becos of its 3D coffee art which depicts some of the famous japanese cartoon characters like doremon, hello kitty, anpanman etc.The food is good too and reasonably priced
3
We decided to do breakfast at Chock full of beans in Changi village after walking past this cafe so many times and noticing it was always full (especially in the mornings). Going on herd instinct, if there are a lot of people, it must be good right? In this instance, we felt it was so-so only..Let me start with the coffee as I thought that was the best thing.. One will notice these guys take a lot of pride in preparing their coffee.. I'm not sure what beans they are using, but I like their coffee. The coffee is aromatic and flavorful, with a slight hint of bitterness. It is also a treat to the eyes! These guys come up with the cutest designs for your coffee. There were even 3-d designs if you ordered latte or hot chocolate I think.. Food wise, they have your full suite of typical english breakfast choices.. Breakfast muesli, full English breaky, French toasts etc.. Quite an extensive breakfast menu. I ordered the eggs Benedict - which is usually what I order when I want a western breaky. To be honest, I felt this was 'so-so' only. the egg wasn't done the way it should have been.. thunk it was slightly over cooked.. and the hollandaise sauce was pretty blend too. The bagel was ok but their serving of cream cheese was so little and one has to pay for another meager serving of cheese.Having said this.. And although I rated only three stars for this, I will certainly go back again for their coffee and to try their other breakfast items.. If the rest of the food items are any better.. I'll update here accordingly!-end
5
Again, glad to have found a recognizable vegetarian option for sandwiches. Great bread. Reasonably priced. Indoor and outdoor seating. A little hard to find..across the street from the Subway restaurant in Changi village area.
4
Nice open place with friendly helpful staff, they have a good selection of snacks, worth a visit, wifi too!
4
Tried the coffee, because we're always looking for espresso made with a real barista-style machine, but although the price was high and the coffee flavour was great, it failed for us because it wasn't made with fresh milk. It makes all the difference, folks!
3
Went here with work colleagues - they enjoyed it. Thought it was OK, but quite expensive for relatively boring italian food.
5
The 3d latte is a novelty. Crowded so expect to wait. Many people sit here for a long time. The cheese cake is nice too.
Will return to try their food next time.
4
CFOB has indoor and outdoor dining area that let customers choose which place they prefer to dine. Serves variety of food from pasta, sandwiches to brunch meals. They serves good aroma coffees too. The amazing 3d art latte was the reason I would like to come back again. You can ask the barista to make for you any kind of 3d latte art you desire. Overall, definitely will recommend this cafe to friends. However, make sure don't come during weekends and peak hours as you will need to wait longer time for them to serve your orders
3
I found it very it very difficult to get service here on a Thursday lunch time, even though there seemed to be as many staff as guests. I choose to sit outside where other guests were sat but it took about 10 minutes to be given a menu and was not offered water. Later, when I asked, I was told that you help yourself to water.I ordered an iced Hazelnut Latte which took about 15 minutes to arrive and was starting to get very impatient. However, when my coffee arrived, it came with a 3D "sculpture" in the foam as shown in the picture, which I had not expected. I assume that this is why the coffee took so long, but frankly, whilst it was very artistic, and tasted good, I would have preferred a conventional iced Latte had I been offered a choice, rather than wait for so long for a drink. Given the speed of service etc I choose to have lunch elsewhere.Wifi was available but incredibly slo
5
One of the best coffee shops / bakeries in singapore. The bread that they bake is fantastic, the bacon and mango sandwich is a must try. If that's not enough the latte art is fantastic and will bring a smile to your face. Been going for years, consistently good quality.
4
They do great latte art on their iced coffees (note that it's only for iced coffees) but during peak timings, it will take 30 minutes for them to serve you the coffee. Food selection is varied and for the two dishes we ordered (a Pasta and the Bruschetta) they tasted good.
2
Was here on a wet day at around 9.10pm. Upon entering, the wait staff placed the menu from a height of around 30cm (aka threw) unto the table. we dismissed this as it was late and she was probably very tired. We also found out that there was no 3D art coz it was past 9pm. The wait staff explained that making the foam would take a long time, she added "approximately 20 mins". but no, we were only allowed to order before 9pm.So we got ourselves coffee, a sandwich and pizza. the parma ham sandwich was totally delicious. loads of ham and vege.It was stated on the menu that pizzas take ard 20 mins to be served. However, our pizza was served in less than 10 mins! we took our first bite. it felt like chewing on rubber. we couldn't even finish our first slice! midway through, our jaws were hurting. On the whole, I would probably go there just for the 3D art novelty. definitely not order pizza again

Located near the airport! Head there for a more premium local experience. Got to order their 3D coffee art!

Just a short walk away from the Changi Village Hotel, Choc-ful of beans is the perfect place for Sunday brunch. The food was superbly presented and delicious. Be wowed by the barista's coffee making skills with cute animal designs in the coffees!

You won't find better latte art in Singapore. Coffee is great. Ambience is nice. Try the bacon and mango sandwich, never disappointing. Really good cafe.

The fun folks create art on your latte and dessert! It is a nice surprise and definitely makes you smile.I hear that you can request for special designs, but have not gotten the chance to try that yet. Quite a chill place, but it's rather inaccessible unless you drive or stay in the East

Went here straight from the airport as I had just arrived in Singapore and wanted to hang out with a friend. It was a Saturday and the place was busy but with a nice buzz. Ordered eggs benedict and a cafe latte with the 3D latte art. The eggs ben was delicious and the latte art was super cute. Not sure exactly how they do it but it looks so fun on your drink. We spent a good few hours here and never felt rushed or like we should finish up and move on. A lovely laid back weekend atmosphere that would definitely make me want to come back for another visit

Didn't try the food here. But was here to chill and ordered drinks. The hot drink they served comes with different 3D art. Everyone will have different art piece even with the same order. The art pieces are really cute. The drinks itself was nice as well which gives a plus to this unique cafe. The cafe is rather small, hence, I would recommend a reservation beforehand else a long waiting list would be expected during peak hours. Anyway do give it a try. A break at the cafe after a cycling day in Pulau Ubin would be a great idea. Cheers

Tucked away in a hidden HDB block is Chock Full of Beans, filled with a steady stream of patrons coming and leaving. Tonight the Beau and I drove all the way to its location at Block 4 Changi Village Road #01-2090, Singapore 500004 having heard positive reviews about it from various sources. Done in warm, cosy earth tones and comfortable wooden tables, Chock Full of Beans exudes inviting vibes to passerbys as well as its current customers. It was not a huge cafe but its open location made for good traffic and is easy to spot.I had the Linguine Pesto with Chicken (SGD$16.00) - with chicken, pesto, garlic, cherry tomatoes and parmesan cheese. Before I sprinkled on the usual (obscene) amount of Tabasco sauce and chilli flakes, we tasted the pasta in its original form. It was surprisingly tasty despite the deceptively simple ingredients and name. The flavor was strong and came as a punch to me especially, expecting it to be bland or average. The pasta also held up well on its springy (QQ) texture despite the sumptuous (olive oil?) gravy it was draped in.The Beau selected the Spaghetti and Beef Meatballs (SGD$17.00) - beef meatballs, tomato sauce, parmesan cheese and parsley. This was another palatable dish with a strong tomato-based flavor, bouncy pasta and meatballs that were succulent and chewy. The Beau waited close to 20 minutes (we were informed of the waiting time) for his Ice Hazelnut Latte (SGD$6.50). The cat / tiger created out of foam was indeed very adorable, making it appear almost cruel to have to slurp it up eventually. The 3-D latte art is only available for selected iced beverages by the way. The hazelnut taste was very strong, its creamy nut flavor hitting us in pangs of deliciousness. After a few sips though, we thought it was a tad overwhelming.For more detailed information and photos, please feel free to visit: http://thearcticstar.blogspot.sg/2014/06/dinner-at-chock-full-of-beans-cafe.htm

We decided to check out chock full of beans as they're known to serve cute latte art in their coffees. We had Ice Caramel Macchiato ($6.50) as 3D art is only available for ice beverages. Do note that 3D latte art is only available upon request. It will be random design as we were told that they were busy. We had brunch, Chock Full of Big Breakfast & Banger & Eggs, very simple dish with scrambled eggs, a croissant & German sausages. Overall, it tasted average and this is definitely not worth the value of $17 bucks.For full review, http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2014/04/chock-full-of-beans-changi-village.htm

Could be hard to get to if you don't drive but it was definitely worth a visit if not for the good coffee but the really unique latte art. Best part was that you don't even have to request for it, each cup is lovingly decorated with latte art!We could not find a good place to sit and decided to grab dinner at a nearby coffeeshop. Came back later after the dinner crowd was gone and found a neat table for 2 inside.Server was friendly enough and was attentive to our needs.Definitely on my go-to list if I want to be wow-ed and inspired by latte art. Or if I'm in the East Coast area getting some weekend cycling done

Tuck neatly away in a corner of Changi Village is this nice little cafe that serves coffee and sandwiches all day. If you are heading this way, this would be a great place to hang out, chill and relax. However, I won't recommend you to drive all the way out here, unless you want to get away from the maddening crowd downtown. If you do drive, there's lots of parking spaces available in the public car park next door.Their sandwiches and coffee is a-ok, nothing fantastic and nothing bad about it. As the other yelpers have proclaimed, it's their latte art that makes the cup of coffee so special and so much more interesting. Not sure how many pictures they can whip up, but judging from what I've seen so far, quite a lot
