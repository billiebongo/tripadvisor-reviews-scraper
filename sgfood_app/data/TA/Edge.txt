The seafood spread is a let down. Menu provided is different( Eg. No Snow crab in the spread) other than that, food is up to expectation
3
Nice place but buffet overpriced for the food given. The seafood station was a letdown. The oysters were very average, and the sashimi selection limited and was dry.
2
The food is great. We love the variety of dishes- western food, indian food,, indonesian, chinese, japanese and sea food. Also great is the wide selection on desserts. But staff at the entrance counter is rude and unfriendly.
4
Wide range of different asian and international cuisines. Excellent quality in both materials and preparation. Really a surprising hotel restaurant.

Finding a place for a family gathering during CNY at the last minute isn’t going to be an easy task so after a few searches, we decided to go for Pan Pacific’s Edge CNY buffet dinner. The spread was quite wide and they even had a CNY selection with suckling pig, Bak Kuah, lohei, Nian Gao to name a few. There are a total of 71 different stations def one of the largest In Singapore. We had a great time there with wonderful service and a cosy environment. The price was a little steep though to be honest.

This restaurant inside the Pan Pacific Hotel has the right to boast its buffet menu. The roasted lamb deserves to be devoured. Seafood is great and the Satays are amazing. You may need to save some space inside to try different cuisines. Fancy a pizza, this place has at least 5 flavors. Dont forget to have their pastries and finish it off with a shot of espresso. Perfect
4
We have done a number of the brunches in Singapore and I think the one at Edge is best.You cannot go wrong with free flow champagne but the options on food here is just amazing, the only reason i do not give five stars is they do need to figure out how to keep food ho
5
Described as a Theatrical Brunch - Sunday Brunch at Edge at the beautiful Pan Pacific hotel is a great 4hr spectacular. Dress code - smart casual. Depends on the group you're with and what the occasion - depends how dressy you'll need to be. Smart shorts and polo shirts for guys was plenty smart when we visited in January.Food - lots of different stations - about a dozen! Superb choice, superb seafood; oysters, whole crabs, prepared lobster, sushi, super large langostines, Amazing curry station - so many different curries to choose from.Duck - roast duck and pancakes - great. Whole lamb taco station, giant burger, foie gras, superb selection of salads, breads, cheeses.Desserts - many many to choose from.Drinks; you choose what you want to drink, stay soft or go for the unlimited Veuve Cliq champagne. I went for rose Veuve - many glasses were drunk/refilled through our 4hr brunch marathon.You don't eat anything before brunch and you won't need anything for the rest of the day either! Service superb, live musical entertainment too. Different tables, styles, places - if you want a quiet corner they'll find it.Yes, it's an expensive experience - so it's a special occasion place. It's worth every penny. Recommended

Visited The Edge restaurant AGAIN for my husbands 50th bday with friends & again was amazing. Free flow Veuve Clicquot, beer, wine & cocktails from 12-3:30 & food until 4. There is a massive choice of foods, salads, charcuterie, raclette, steaks, roasts, curries (Indian, Thai, Japanese) seafood, cheeses, desserts etc etc. The staff are very friendly & attentive
3
Opted for breakfast here as staying at hotel and no where within walking distance appeared open (except of course other hotel restaurants). The breakfast buffet is well over priced, but there is an “a la carte” option - but you have to ask for it specifically. Disappointed with the range of options available on the menu. Food was average and over priced. Felt we were treated differently for not paying the full breakfast buffet rate.Decent for a quick bite I guess, but don’t have high expectations if eating off the menu. Would have definitely enjoyed the buffet more had the budget allowed (around $50 per person).Staff friendly and helpful
5
Good range and variety of food. Fresh and wonderful. Good staff, was waited on by very attentive waiter.
4
Excellent choices of international food to pick! Very spacious！ Some rooms for improvement for fruit selection.
4
Nice selection of seafood and grill. A little poor on cold meats and especially poor with the free drinks. But overall a nice birthday celebration
4
Repeat trip. Good and service was good as usual but certain Items were not up to standard. The chilli crab had a fishy taste and pasta wasn't as good. Understandably every restaurant has its bad day so this will not stop me from going again.
5
We were there shortly before Christmas and the Holiday Buffet was possibly the best we have enjoyed anywhere and that includes top hotels in Las Vegas. Prime seafood and meats...many prepared to order and brought to your table. Nice atmosphere and excellent service
5
Superb new year eve dinner buffet spread, seafood section fresh and tasty, good lobsters. Excellent entertainment by staffs too! Thanks for an awesome night! Worth the price!
5
We were staying at the Pan Pacific and decided to dine at Edge because of the good reviews, the convenience of it being in our hotel and also because reviews stated they catered for gluten free.On arrival I let the waiter who showed us to our table that I was gluten free, and he arrange for chef Jupiter to come and show me around all of the food (which was a lot!) to let me know what I could eat. When you're gluten free choices can often be quite restrictive and the same type of things but there was a lot of variety to what I could eat - sushi, GF pasta, a variety of curries, bread, salads, meats etc. Both myself and my non-GF husband ate very well and were really happy with the food selection and quality. The chefs even made me a special plate of GF desserts which were amazing.All in all, we are really glad we decided to dine at Edge, we didn't know if the price was a bit expensive for essentially a buffet but it was definitely worth it
4
It was good! wide spread of food! What stood out: cold alaskan king crabs were very fresh. halibut and pork ribs were amazing! also had the baked crayfish, nama chocolates: rum and green tea. peach was so so. Durian pengat was good. so was the barbecue section with grilled sausages, marinated beef and prawns
4
Been here a couple of times for their Seafood buffet - the food selection is excellent, for fresh seafood and cooked seafood. Definitely one of the better buffets out there.Although, I would point out that 1 out of 4 times, the oysters weren't really fresh tasting. But then, there since there are so many other food to indulge in - I have no complains and would simply skip the oysters
5
Asian buffet perfect for our last night in singapore. We asked if one of the chefs could show us around and explain everything we could eat. No problem. They then made is fresh hot crab gluten free and a plate of desserts GF. Really really good and great service.
5
Great spread that includes a festive (Xmas) theme. The seafood was very fresh and alone will justify the cost. Noticed that a serving staff was always attentive to the tables in his assigned area, which is super for diners.
4
Great food, casual and relaxed, excellent service. Needs a better selection of cheeses.
Would be nice if there was a selection of soft drink with the buffet as currently there are only cordials.
5
Had a pre-Christmas meal with frriends at this Restaurant. Unlike other buffet restaurants that suffer from lacklustre food and poor service during the festive crush of hungry diners, thankfully the Edge suffered none of these shortcomings. Both service and food was as usual, impeccable.
4
One of our favorite dining destination. The Edge offers a wide range of delicacy where you can eat to your heart content.
A must try is the Crayfish Thermidor, freshly baked and served warm.
Do make your reservation as it is always full.
5
Lobster, Turkey, Ham, Pork Cheek and a lot of other offerings. Xmas dinner offerings were great. Will be back. Thanks to Mei, Charmaine & Suresh
5
The buffet in Edge was splendid, the food was amazing. The choices was plenty and very organized. Edge has a lot of different cuisines to choose from and very delicious. The staffs are very accommodating and friendly.
4
Food varieties not as great as previous years. The nonya laksa is still as great though. Went for lunch buffet and arrived slightly past 12pm. Sofa seats allocated was dirty; plenty of leftover food bits. Tried the LIVE station pasta and it was disappointing. The dessert corner is still the best and it's always filled with people queuing. You can even spot guys queuing for dessert too.
5
The varieties of food are one of the best and most among all the other buffets that I had ever have.Food tasted quite nice, and had a complimentary glass of wine too.The sushi/sashimi section can improve in terms of the queue and speed in replenishing the food.The dessert varieties were plenty and nicely placed/decorated.Overall, its a place filled with a lot of varieties of food and good quality too, super worth eating at Edge.Will definitely come back again
5
We stayed at the Pan Pacific for 4 days and went here for breakfast every day. The selection of food is outstanding - western dishes, eastern, Indian, fresh fruit juice, amazing pastries, cheeses, etc. We had so much food for breakfast that we typically skipped lunch. Try the red velvet waffles. Service was very good also. Nice atmosphere and seating. We did not eat lunch or dinner here, just the breakfast buffet. I would even recommend this for meals if you don't stay here
4
Brought along my parents for buffet dinner to celebrate my mum's birthday. Food was good, there was a wide spread of variety to choose from. Seafood selections is fresh and constantly topped-up throughout the rounds. Service from the restaurant staff is also excellent. Special mention to Mr. Mark who is always efficient in keeping our table clean and attentive to our needs, and also to Mr. Joe who show us to the table and give us a brief introduction of the food varieties in the restaurant. Overall, My family enjoyed our dinner very much, would be perfect if there is some birthday surprise for my mum as i made a little special mention during reservation, nonetheless, an enjoyable dining experience with Edge
5
Went there for team lunch
Wide varieties of foods, seafoods available for lunch too!!! Love the carviar and duck.
Nice environment, and view of Marina Bay Sand and the Eye of Singapore.
3
we came last year and compared this year. overpriced for very much the same thing.
sashimi still good though.
5
An amazing spread of food. Seafood was fresh and Oysters freshly shucked. Lobster bisque was slightly disappointing but desserts and other meats more than make up for it
5
We enjoyed our dining experience here. The food is good and the service is excellent. Thank you to Mark and muru for being attentive and friendly.
5
we loved the foods and atmosphere is nice and serving is good.
we will come back again for next dinning.
5
Service was top notch and the food was excellent. Slightly pricey, but definitely worth it. Would recommend.
4
Food was excellent and the spread has lots of varieties and sumptuous selections. Price wise, it is on the high side which was the only downside in our opinion.
5
Our family gathered for lunch buffet to celebrate our little grandson's birthday. The restaurant layout was spacious, nice and bright. The food quality was good and the amount was plentiful. The best part was the service we experienced from the serving staff especially from Ms. Rosemary, who was ever ready to serve with a cheerful smile! throughout our meal, a truly dedicated service staff! Mr. Joe was also happy to light up and present our birthday boy's cake! All these nice people really makes our little gathering an enjoyable one 
5
I brought my parents here to try out the buffet at edge. Been here like 1 year ago and i really love the selections and seafood counter. And today, food are the up to standard worth the price. Service is good and very attentive. Mark take care of us very well and always put on a smile. He is very efficient in service and great in hospitality. I would like to also highlight the Team at the bar counter, you guys are super friendly and helpful. I have encountered a few staff at the bar for drinks requests, they greeted and served me with good manners. For this experience i would like to say your buffet rate is worth for us to pay for it
3
Food quality is not bad. Wide spread and lots of choices. Can get loud with live music and large groups gathered. Come hungry and stay from start to finish. Dessert options could be widened. Make sure you have some sort of discount to really it really worth the price. Overall, the impression is ok although nothing really stands out. Service is good but if you don't order the alcohol package the service on the water can be a little slow. aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa a
4
Was here for dinner with friends for. Food are good and excellent service from the server Mark who was attentive & helpful to our need.
5
I was looking for cold seafood buffet when I found this. If you are looking for cold seafood, this place should fulfill what you are looking for. Their meat selections are also worth the calories.
5
Came for dinner celebration for my grandmother's birthday. Good food and good service, especially the server Mark who was attentive to the tables he was assigned to.
5
Was celebrate dad birthday dinner at here last Saturday. Alot of variety to choose. There will be a 20% discount for UOB credit card member. Will visit again.
5
The Edge has maybe the friendliest staff ever! They made my meals very enjoyable. Food is incredible and you can have a taste of food from different parts of the world in one night. Highly recommended.
5
Great meal, with a large variety of various cuisines. Great service as well. Shoutout to Mark especially for the great service! He was prompt and helpful (My grandma is wheelchair bound and he has the initiative to help us navigate around the various chairs in our way, store the wheelchair and bring the wheelchair out when we were about to leave). Will come back for more! Love the edge, keep up the good work
5
We had our dinner on Monday night at the Edge. It was truly a very pleasant and scrumptious meal. The spread was fantastic, about 10 stations in total: Chinese, Indian, Peranakan, Japanese, Western, Grill, Seafood, Salads, Drink Bar and Dessert. With such a magnificent spread. I think we over ate but it was all worth it. We had the Christmas menu which began on Monday itself hence there was turkey, Christmas pudding and ham which was the highlight. Very delicious! Other local delicacy examples included chili crab, laksa and satay!Our only gripe was that the dessert station was quite limited in spread. Could be improved with more cakes, pastries and ice cream types. The drinks were also rather limited, with coffee, tea and cordials. Nonetheless it was lovely that they served TWG tea.Service wise it was wonderful. Our server, Mark was very friendly, attentive and responsive. Table was cleared and water was refilled consistently without even asking. Thank you Mark for making the dinner even better!All in all it was an A+ experience for us. The dessert and drinks side could be improved but other than that we had very enjoyable meal
5
The quality and quantity of this buffet is outstanding. Fish, Beef, vegetarian, sushi, maki, oysters from New Zealand, Wagyu beef, lamb, chilli crab, Indian dishes, deserts, etc. etc. best quality and you get good value for your money. Drinks are expensive (18S$++ for a glass of wine or 14S$ for a beer)
5
The variety of food is fantastic and quality of it is great. I merely requested in the reservation note for a window seat as it was my wifeâ€™s birthday and they gave us such a pleasant surprise with a wonderful cake! Love it there and will be back again
5
Good spread of food, from Indian, chinese, japanese, korean and western, so yummy spread. we met a good service staff, Mark, he is attentive,initiative and observant. He saw presents on the table and ask are we celebrating a birthday? He send over a birthday cake and sang the birthday song. Very impressive, he deserve a pat on his back. The only downside is they don't serve cabonated drinks only diluted cordial drink which i think you must improve this
5
Variety of choice from Asian to western food. The staff are friendly and attentive. The place is clean and hygenic
4
Wide range of food and went home full and happy. Quality of food is considered not good. Only the “drink bar” was disappointing. Would prefer if they have more juice variety instead of just some lemon soda and another soda which was quite diluted.
4
The spread at Edge had a lot more variety than anticipated. For the Italian station, some of the dishes were a little over-seasoned. Also, the Chinese station's black pepper crab was lacking in taste. However, everything else was well-prepared and delicious! Especially the desserts.
5
However, I do hope that they keep their quality up . . . as last Saturday, they lacked their usual oysters in the cold bar. And the durian penggat was a tad less viscous
5
Totally enjoyed the great service and awesome selection of food there. Edge is easily my fav buffet choice!
5
The service was good. Upon realising that it was a farewell dinner, the manager took initiative to offer a cake and candle.
Other than that, the Laksa and sashimi were good. The dessert was fantastic. Will definitely go again!
4
The food is as always - uhhhmaaahzing! But service is another story... At one of the counters with missing tongs, i requested from the counter personnel. Guess what his reply was! "can you go get it from the service staff?" In my mind, my question was more like, "then what are you? And what are you here for?"
3
Had breakfast at EDGE during our recent hotel Stay with Pan Pacific. It was a buffet breakfast with the layout of the food mostly on one side of the restaurant with an occasional few stations in the centre of the restaurant, The Staff were pleasant and service with a smile. They were prompt and quite fast and efficient in seating the guest, taking their order for the hot drinks. Not to mention that, they were also efficient in clearing the empty plates. However, there is one thing that I felt that the service staff could improve on ie is the Hot Drinks. As the hot drinks especially Coffees are made by the baristas, it is helpful for the staff to be attentive to guests and check with them should they required a coffee refill etc. That's what mades the difference in dining in a restaurant of one hotel to another which is lacking in the restaurant. Not a single staff that came to our table to clear the plates or pass by came to check should we need a refill of our hot drinks
4
During my stay at Pan Pacific, I had the complementary buffet breakfast three times here in Edge restaurant. It’s on the third floor of the hotel. The food is real good. So many options. Try to take a seat near to the window to enjoy the view
2
$52 for limited spread of seafood - prawn; some skinny crab.., nothing close to its webpage that showed lobsters; crab legs &etc.A slice of birthday cake was severed when 3 were still eating and I busy searching for an important new in the Straits Times! Quite a angry moment when we needed to put everything away for it!Coffee & tea included, but TWG tea bag was being removed cos it needs to be put into the common tea pot! That’s incredible!
5
Dinner on Saturday night with some friends, it rivals the Buffets in Las Vegas great range and something for everyone. I will certainly go back.
5
Wide variety of food with different stations ranging from salads, mains, pasta, and desserts. The Oyster really fresh and the Alaskan crab really the best!! Very good service, staff specially Mark.. Definitely worth the money and I would recommend and visit it again..
-table 22
4
I think what is unique about the Edge buffet is that it offers mostly local food - laksa, indian curries, peranakan flavours and the list goes on. This is refreshing because so many buffets are now homogeneous and international. It cost somewhere in the $50s so I thought that was good value too
4
The atmosphere was quite classy and it was definitely cosy for a good family dinner. For $68++/adult and 20% discount if paying with UOB credit card, I would consider this reasonable with the good spread of quality food. The Alaska King crab and fresh oysters were really great. The roast beef was done just right, tender anf juicy. My kids enjoyed the laksa, grilled german sausages and the tasty desserts. The creme burlee and Portuguese egg tarts were yummy. One little disappointment was the complementary birthday cake was too petty, just a slice enough for the birthday girl only
5
Dinner on Oct 14, 2017I would like to express my sincere thanks to your dedicated and courteous staffs who were very patient and caring towards my mother-in-law, who celebrated her 81st birthday at the Edge last Saturday. I would like to specially mentioned Mr Frankie who diligently ensured that her needs are met and also for his prompt service in clearing our plates and filling our water.Thank you very much, Franki
5
Great dinner at the Edge! love the food here! Fresh and yummy! we were seated at table 22, with the singapore flyers and mbs in the view! not to forget the excellent service from Mark! keep up the attitude and the smile on your face! you did a great job Mark!
4
The buffet spread was very extensive and most stations were well above average. The seafood range is very good and seafood lovers will find lots of value eating here. Some things to improve on include the knowledge of the host on the promotions/discounts as advertised by the restaurant. Overall, the Edge is definitely pricey but quite worth it to visit on special occasions, etc.
3
Disappointed with the selection of food.The grill station served only fish, prawns, beef and hotdogs.There was not a single lamb/mutton dish offered, not even at the Indian food selection! The selection at the bread corner was also limited to the cheap baguette with nothing fancy.
4
Lots of seafood selection including king crabs, oysters, scallops etc, in addition to the standard buffet selections. There are chicken rice sections, stir fry station where you get to pick the ingredients, Japanese sushi & sashimi, pasta, pizzas, salad bars, grilled sections, Indian food sections & desserts bars.My favourite is the desserts bars, durian pengit is a must try, with the chocolate truffles - Rum & raisin
5
We visited my daughter's family and my son -in -law treated us to a wonderful Buffet Brunch at the Edge Restaurant at Pan-Pacific Hotel. It was a feast to see so much array of fresh big lobsters, crabs, prawns and mussels. So many other food stations with priced meat such as wagyu beef, Peking duck, lamb were on a visual and palatable delight. We had a delectable display of different kinds of cheese, bread, pastry and desserts that was every sweet tooth's desire. Kinda pricey though but was worth every penny spent. Great restaurant for a quality buffet 
5
Very attentive service crew and a whole wide range of tasty treats and foods. Thumbs up for everything and keep it up. It means a great deal to me and my wife.
5
Just want to compliment excellent service from Mark, very attentive and friendly 👍👍
Food was great too
5
Service was great, with our server Raj exceeding our expectations. Love the crab station and dessert bar is special. Great ambience.
5
Excellent good and great atmosphere. The gentleman, Raj, also went the extra mile to provide service that exceeded our expectations. Favourite hotel buffet in singapore by far!
5
Food to note here: oysters, crab, fresh prawns, steak, desserts! Nice selection of food from various cultures. Good service.
5
Was really impressed with the service rendered by the staff at the Edge; they were prompt in clearing our table, served the bday cake at the right timing without the need for any prompt, and the chef even recommended menu that were more suitable for children when we were trying to make our choices. The food and desserts were great too! Highly recommended
5
Love the spread! They have Korean (my fav section), Western, Japanese, Chinese, grilled, dessert, etc. Seafood was fresh and the oysters were thick! We celebrated my boyfriend's birthday here, and he was surprised with a super rich chocolate cake! Special mention to Chef Chee Vooi for his jovial personality and Raj for who was very polite and efficient in clearing our plates. Great job! Overall, a fantastic experience! (:For your consideration: it would be great if the waffles are placed on a warme
5
Food and Drink is plentiful.This is the best way to spend a boozy Singapore afternoon with friends. The brinks flow all afternoon and the food is all you can eat Buffet of an amazing array of styles and choices Not the cheapest afternoon but worth every cent
3
The food variety looks at lot, however it is distributed over a large area which seemed much less.The ambience is ok. I was directed to seat with a view that overlooks the road. The chairs are normal chairs at a kitchen table which are not comfortable as compared to the sofa seats which are empty in the restaurant. So if you are going, ask for the sofa chairs area instead. The food quality is above average. At the seafood section, there are oysters, prawns, crab legs, mussels and shell fish. However the oysters are smaller and the prawns have a strong prawn smell. At the dessert counter the section looks large but you can only eat some items on display. The others are kept inside the fridge and you have to ask the chef for it.At the meat counter, the roast beef are already craved out but in thick slices. You may put the black pepper sauce on it. On the right I can also see baked salmon fish and roasted lamb too. There are also pasta, asparagus BBQ pork ribs and beef stew and fish curry.There are some local hawkers' food available in the restaurant too like Laksa noodles, rojak, chicken rice and satay.If you like pizzas you can have a choice of 3 kinds. There are also Indian curries and vegetables which are tasty.As I was also celebrating a friend's birthday, the hotel also provided a slice of chocolate cake. It was a nice gesture. I also ordered wine to go along the buffet and the waitress was very attentive and friendly
5
not my first time visiting as their buffet spread is one with very good varieties. the cold seafood counter is the most popular as well as the japanese station. grill station was great too, except i havent seen the scallops which they used to have. our server Mark was super attentive, bringing us lemon water and utensils when we had only just sat down with the crabs. his service was impeccable. couldnt have asked for a better way to spend a friday date night with my husband
4
The taste and variety of food is good. Service and ambience is remarkable too. Will definitely return and recommend to others
4
Good food though a bit pricey and the durian pengat ran out just 2 hours into the buffet so that was a bit disappointing. Otherwise good spread of food
5
There was a wide selection of food, food was yummy, dining atmosphere was good, good service provided!
5
Service was very good. Clearance of plate was prompt. Food is not bad but few varieties. But good quality.
4
It's the time of the month which I had craving for a buffet again - seafood buffet to be exact. Edge weekday seafood buffet got to be the choice. Wide selection of international seafood cuisines coupled with a nice scenic view, who says weekday needs to be boring
1
Went to the breakfast buffet today. Could not find anything appetising enough to want to eat, poor selection of fruit - no berries. No non vegetarian curries avail, no fish in the Japanese Section. Fish balls only or fake seafood . Cheap ingredients, just totally unacceptable The custard tarts inedible. Dont go
5
After extensive research we opted for the Tuesday night offer at the Pan Pacific Hotel in Singapore. This included the full buffet experience with unlimited drinks for around 90SD per person. Comparing this with other establishments in the city, this would appear to be a middle of the road restaurant cost wise. The restaurant were notified upon booking that one of the party required gluten free food and as we sat down, the waitress confirmed this and promptly invited the head chef over to walk the buffet and explain what was and was not gluten free. This was a great touch and inspired confidence in what you would be consuming. Normally, a buffet would be simply a no go, but this place is simply brilliant.  The buffet itself is set out in a way that has stations for seafood, meats, curry’s, cheese and cold meats, noodles, desserts and many more. It really does cater for every palate. The only issue was is that it took so long to get around with the head chef that you had to try and stop yourself from salivating over all of the delicious food. We opted for the strategy of trying a little bit from each section and it did not disappoint. The steak was cooked to perfection and so too were the accompanying prawns and all of the curries and noodles offered a tasty insight into the local cuisines. The desserts were again incredible and there were several that were gluten free, which made a refreshing change to being told you can only eat the fruit. The wine that was included in the offer was also good quality and complimented the food well. Perhaps the only down side was that there was so much on offer that to do it justice you probably need to go on two consecutive nights so that you don’t miss out on anything.
5
Breakfast at The Edge isn't so much an experience, more a culinary adventure.Greeted at the entrance usually by the ever enthusiastic Janice, quickly offered tea or coffee then you are on your own to explore more food stations than I could count. Dishes from Europe, China, India and almost every where in between awaits you, even drinks - there are hot or cold, smoothies fruit juices - you can even watch as they turn fresh apples, carrots or oranges into very fresh juices. After 5 mornings I've still not managed to get round all the stations. Just try to avoid peak times, as not only does it get very busy but the wait for the elevator can be longer then normal.
5
Every item on offer was great. Even for the price ($78++), the food was splendid.We chose the Tuesday night Surf And Turf.The wagyu was so tender while the King Crab was massive and juicy. Oysters felt like they were fresh off the boat.Would come again next time
5
I went with my parents to the Sunday brunch at Edge. There are two options: with champagne $188 or without champagne $128. We went for the one without the alcohol.The Buffet has a very good spread with great selections. Two things that worth mentioning: (1) the seafood selection is outstanding: besides the usual stuff, they also serve black caviar, king crab, Boston lobster and oysters. (2) there are several stations that take orders where u can customise your food. On top of that, my mom and I love the sweet flour sauce and spring onion they offer for Peking duck, which makes the dish taste similar to the authentic ones in Beijing.The Nama chocolate and Yuzu sorbet are must tries from the dessert section. However, there is no durian Pengat on Sundays
4
The atmosphere is nice with the natural light from the big window. Location of restaurant centralised with easy access of public transport.
5
The variety at Edge never disappoints. Quality and taste are top notches and you can't get any fresher seafood! The live stations are well maned, food served fast. Desserts are the grand finale to end an awesome meal~
5
Good ambience for a meetup lunch gatherings. Food varieties was that many. Quality food served as well.
4
The choice of food on the Sunday brunch was awe-inspiring. We had been contacted to confirm our reservation and expected it to be full, but it was far from that and no queues at all for the various stations. Quality of food corresponded to our expectations â€“ very good but not really top notch. The free flow of Veuve Cliquot was really generous. Towards the end we switched to red wine, which seemed to be included in the deal. The only drawback was the rather loud country-and-western style music
5
There is a wide variety of food available for breakfast with 2 egg stations! The food is spread out over a large area, so do walk around otherwise you may miss the Japanese section, the noodle section (cooked to order), some local dishes such as char kuey teow, as well as the usual bread, cereal, fruit, cold cuts and pastries/bread. If you ate a bit of everything, you could probably miss lunch and not notice
4
If you have not been to the Edge at the Pan Pacific and trying out their buffet dinner, you must definitely try at least once. The spread was incredibly wide and I couldn't even taste everything even if I really wanted to. What we really like about the restaurant are:1. Some of the best and freshest Salmon and Tuna sashimi2. Very good quality sausages, freshly grilled for you3. Fresh oysters, prawns, and various varieties of crabs4. A very good selections of roast meats like roasted pork, roast duck and chicken5. An awesome selection of desserts, including local desserts like durian mousse, chendol sago, thai milk tea ice cream, etc.6. Enough varieties to cater to different tastes preferencesI would love to come back to this restaurant again so that I can try those food that I didn't.Enjoy
5
Visited the restaurant on a Saturday evening, the environment is nice and conducive. Not crowded at all. Even at 10.30pm the food are still available, there are still few tables of guests around. More than sufficient food selections around. Frankie and Stella were great to accommodate my last minute request for a slice of cake for my upcoming birthday guest. And included a birthday song! Selection and quality of food are fantastic. Dessert selection is good, I was expecting to see the Pan Pacific award winning strawberry shortcake but unfortunately it was not available. The tandoori fish is too overwhelming that the fish freshness is diminished. Drink bar staff can be more proactive and friendly. Worth visiting for a relaxing evening of good food and ambience.
4
Love this buffet for the variety and seafood. The indian food was was also good. The veg curry at the hot food area was not even warm. Bubur chacha was a little sour but i'm able to tell its the coconut water they used that caused it to be sour or coconut milk spoil sour. It did not have any putrid smell
5
We tried this restaurant as it was considered one of Top 10 hotel buffet restsurant in Singapore. the ambience is classy and makes you feel to stay there for the whole night. A lot of variety of foods and it is all delicious. The staffs are very friendly, attentive and accommodating. Overall experience is superb. Will be back again :

So I got to know that Thursday was a seafood night. Although the priciest day of Edge's buffet, it was worth every single cent. You can't go wrong with the wide selection of international cuisines cooked the seafood way. One will suit your taste buds. Service wise, it was excellent. My plates were cleared almost immediately leaving my table always with room for more food.
4
Still one of the best buffets. A bit pricey unless you got special promotion. Wish there are more local desserts like ice kachang or chengtng???
5
I booked Edge to celebrate my son's birthday. It was a bit pricey however quality of the food and the services were absolutely amazing. My wife and my son really loved the food and the place.
4
Wide spread available from western to eastern delights. My favourite section is the fresh food and salad areas. I also love the noodles section. Fish ball noodle soup my first choice.
4
Good selection of both local & international food. Food is fresh & topped up consistantly. Very attentive & happy staff, especially Ivy. Will recommend.
5
Staff there was really attentive and was always ready for your every needs. I was reallly impressed with the food quality. Worth the price!
5
good mix and varieties of tasty food and desserts. replenished and refilled quickly. experienced made more pleasant by attentive and efficient staff who maintained a friendly and cheerful disposition especially Jeya
4
Nice and good for dinner. Relax and good ambience for couple dinner. Variety is very good and fresh.

Tried the dinner buffet here on Tuesday night while staying at this hotel. Excellent buffet with a vast selection. I did not see some of their advertised menu items , like the short ribs with the seared scallops. Maybe you have to ask for it. Everything was tasty and I loved the satay. There were some drinks included, but it was fairly watered down. I charged the bill to my room and when checking out realized there was no discount given as advertised on their in room smart phone. Pointed this out and it was a very apologetic and quick correction done. Overall a excellent meal at a good price
5
Ate here for four hours with my wife at the Sunday Champagne brunch for the third time. This restaurant has been exceptional every time with 16 food stations and a myriad of options. The list of food is too much to describe but suffice to say it covers Asian, Western, Seafood, and desserts to a standard which is unmatched for a buffet. You can also have dishes cooked to order and the overall freshness is a delight.Add to that the endless Veuve Champagne, with the live band, and this is an experience, not just a meal. I had a taste this time of 30 different dishes and despite having been before there are still wonders to discover! I'm not sure what's left to try next time
5
Really superb buffet, top notch food. We went for the extra alcohol option (wines) which was only an additional $10SGD per person, very good wines and if you are having a couple of drinks this is very good value. We went with our entire family, food options are immense and the quality very good.
5
It was my mom's birthday and they prepared a slice of cake and sang a birthday song for her. It was not a big deal but definitely a kind gesture and great surprise!
5
Kiki was very kind and attentive to our needs, she initiated conversation and did a clear orientation of the area for us knowing it was our first visit to Edge. Thumbs up to Kiki!
5
There was a wide spread of food available, from western to asian delicacies. Its dessert station was definitely an excellent among the rest of the stations too!
5
It was a good experience.. food is nice.. good atmosphere.. staff is attentive.. but layout of restaurant a bit messy.. need to walk a lot to find out all the food variety
5
Went for Sat dinner and was impressed by the place and the food.Food - very good spread, different varieties but most importantly almost everything was very nice! (a surprise given that it was a buffet) From fresh sashimi, to seafood on ice, to grilled stuff, to dessert.. they were all fresh, well prepared and tasted very good.Place - very spacious, nice deco and well placed tables with partitions to provide privacy. We had a table next to the window and yet not far from the food
4
Went for lunch on weekday, Nice spread locating separately on own sections. Quality food but limited on seafood and japanese sections, although salmon and octopus sashimi is very nice and generous. Overall, average or a little below average for food variety and quality for the same class in singapore
5
We paid $88 each for a dinner buffet on a Thursday night. This was probably the best buffet we have ever been to in all our years of travelling. The variety of food is outstanding, the many different kitchen stations are all worth a try, and the staff and service are first class
3
It was a Sunday evening, I have celebrated my husband's birthday at The Edge. It's almost full house as there were a lot of tourist travel in big group, batches after another. There are different sections to segregate different food categories. Fruits, Japanese food, Indian food, roasted duck/poultry, live vegetable cooking booth, pizza, teppanyaki, desserts etc. To my disappointment, they don't serve lobsters, only snow crab. We ordered satay and steak, these were supposed to be served to us, but they did not. We waited for almost 45mins, then we asked the staff, she said it's due to the crowd. Then another 30 mins, the food was not served yet. Then only the staff asked the chef to prepare. I believe the restaurant can do better on their efficiency. Given the large varieties, i will still goes back some day, if there is a chance
5
Firstly,I'm very impressed with the great service provided by waitress Kiki,she tried her best to attend to our needs despite having to serve many tables.Kiki showed initiative by bringing a nutcracker and a pair of scissors for crabs when she saw my wife attempting to pry open the chili crab,without being told to do so.I have a habit of drinking a large amount of tea during my meals,as I tend to eat a lot of meat and oily food.When Kiki saw me bringing back 2 cups of tea from the bar counter,she offered to make a pot of tea for me so that I didn't have to keep walking to and fro from the bar counter.Even though Kiki had many tables to serve and attend to,she made sure that our needs were met,without even us asking.It has been a very long time,since I experienced such quality service.Moving on to food,there's a wide variety of food,ranging from seafood to meat and different cuisines.There is something for everyone,and most of the food are quality food.Food that stood out in my opinion are: 1.All the nonya dishes. 2.The cheeses,especially the blue cheese. 3.Coffee ice cream (this is definitely worth a revisit). 4.Jackfruit cake. 5.Grilled Lamb Chop. 6.Strawberry Soft Chocolate. 7. Pasta with some hint of Truffle. 8. Lamb Taco.All these plus many more for only 78++,really worth the price in my opinion.Coming to areas of improvement,the Sashimi could do better by having the chef slice the fish only after the customer places the order,instead of slicing everything beforehand and exposing the fish to air.I was put off by this and didn't eat any Sashimi.Overall,I had an extremely satisfying dinner experience and I look forward to next visit to Edge
5
The last time I went was over 2 years back. Standard still maintain except the Spanish suckling pig I was looking forward to was missing. They still have as many different stations of different cuisines that you will be spoilt for choice. However, Peking Duck definitely needs improvement. Totally not up to mark. I really love the Sashimi, seafood, good selection of cheese and not to miss - foie gras! And the lady Ivy attending to our area is so sweet and always come around to top up our glasses and clear the plates. This is one of the best champagne brunch you must go.
4
Nice view too. Many food like crab leg and sashimi. But one of the most expensive in Singaore and it does not have a lot of chinese food
4
Very nice place, the buffet is not too bad... I say it's value for money. The waiting staff are very friendly & accommodating.
4
I went there and served by a waitress name KiKi, she is friendly and service was prompt , excellent!
5
great place to be with a toddler. my boy was so happy to be able to choose from sooo many varieties of food and its free for his age!!! the recep also made a call to confirm our special request.
5
In a delightful setting surrounded by the numerous 'food stops' we explored, shared and savoured the seafoods, salads, poultry, meats, vegetables, deserts et al prepared to reflect world wide cuisine excellence. The champagne flowed as we increasingly shared stories around the table of what we had found and enjoyed. We just kept going back and back. High end value.
5
This restaurant serves an excellent buffet dinner though a touch on the expensive side. It is arguably the best buffet in Singapore (comparing it to the Line, Carousel, Ellenborough Market etc.). The seafood consisting of Canadian lobsters, Canadian oysters, King crab legs, prawns, mussels, clams, scallops etc. are plentiful. They keep refilling them as soon as they are consumed and no matter what time it is. I wish the restaurant, in addition to the existing variety of sauces, also serves just plain warm butter and garlic sauce which will go very well with the lobsters and crab legs. Other dishes I managed to taste after my over-the-top feasting on the seafood, and worth mentioning are the delicious laksa, roast pork, baked Vietnamese scallops and BBQ steak. Finally to the finish off this feast are the delicious ice cream of different flavours followed by the decadent durian puree and a hot cup of latte. Please consider adding durian ice cream as well. This totally enjoyable dinner experience was very much enhanced by my helpful and courteous server Yvonne and the pleasant relaxed atmosphere of The Edge. The overused word to describe this dinner experience is "Awesome"
5
This is one of the best buffet i have. Admittedly, it is rather pricey, but with the UOB 20% discount it is still affordable. Seafood lovers will enjoy this one, but the other food are a hit too. Good quality stuffs all round for the other cooked food like squid ink pasta and roast meats. And the desserts, great soft chocolate, great ice cream. Good enough for me though there are others
5
25/06/2017 : Thanks to Miss Jiwon ( The Korean staff if i'm not wrong) for her attentive service throughout the night. Kept clearing our table without failed.The Edge Buffet is my son's favourite buffet in Singapore. It is a international restaurant which able to cater to all nationality and cultures. Best dessert is durian puree which 1 never enough.. The peanuts sauce for the satay is supreme. Special holiday they have unlimited lobster. Local delight like Rojak is never tired. They have the best spaghetti recipe according to my son who is picky on food. Tips: Put a scoop of ice cream on the wafer, it just tasted too marvellous 
5
So we went here for dinner last night, and we were not disappointed. Ok so at around $90pp it's not cheap but you soon get your money's worth with the all you can eat lobsters, crabs,salmons and prawns. Not to mention the roast beef, BBQ grill meats and seafood, curries and so much more!!! The restaurant itself is very nice but not so fancy that you can't just relax and not have to worry too much about what you wear ( my husband didn't want to wear a buttoned shirt in the heat so had a plain black t shirt). The only thing I would say; if we're paying so much then they should charge $10 for an instant coffee.
4
Trip to Edge: great ambience, food was okay, price is very expensive. went on the seafood night. i expected more for the price paid. different variety of food, at first it was wow but when i ate the different food was so so only. oysters was not as fresh as before ( mentioned by my boyfriend who went for the second time) it was our anniversary, they gave us a cake which was nice
5
What a fabulous choice of breakfast items they had.
Something for everyone. We were spoilt for choice
Well done.
5
Wide variety of cuisines and food but too small a stomach.
Service is excellent and prompt. Will definitely come again.
4
if you enjoy seafood then this is a great choice, made a few new friends and visited for dinner, a great night out.
4
Very nice ambience with decent variety of dishes. I love their fresh prawns, laksa and desserts. I will go back again with my family and friend.
5
Variety and quality of food was great. Staff were generally friendly with one or two exceptions. The ambience and setting is great too, as its not too crowded. The view of the marina area was great too.
5
Seafood was superb...italian section not so appetizing...wonderful desserts...but what attract us most is Justin's service!!! We appreciate your attention on us Justin. Thank you.
1
I went there to celebrate my birthday with my family. To be frank, it was quite disappointing with the quality of food and service (especially the station Chef, some of them was very rude). All the hot food was not even warm. The quality is really not worth the price of $98.00 ++ per person! The laksa was so salty.. and ice cream was so sweet!
4
We were a party of 12 having dinner to celebrate a family occasion. Restaurant manager Mr Yap, took it upon himself to make arrangements to make the event special. Food range was very wide and quality was good. Our server for the evening Ms Jiwon was particularly hard working and conscientious and was fairly discreet the whole evening. The family enjoyed themselves thoroughly and we will be back
5
we visited the restaurant on a weekday . not so crowded and we had a peaceful meal. it has a wide array of food. but what i specially like is the seafoods: oyster, prawns and lobster! came back for second servings! i hope they will offer different kinds of coffee as well. i requested for cappucino to be told the buffet dont carry cappucino but brewed coffee only.
4
We were walking around this area and not sure what to eat for dinner. The manager offered us to walk around the buffet before deciding.It was definitely an eye opener with the humongous spread of seafood - Boston lobster, crayfish, Alaskan crab, prawns, oysters, sashimi amd more.There was also Indian, Chinese, Italian, Japanese, western main dishes and large variety of desserts
5
Great selection of food, everyone enjoyed it. There is something for everyone. Love the seating arrange too
5
Food is perhaps the hardest category one can compete in Singapore. More than one, however, congratulate me for staying in a place with the best food. After eating here for 3 days, I can affirm that the food here is really fantastic.
5
Pricey. But worth every penny. Awesome spread of Japanese, Chinese, Malay, western cuisine.
Good service.
4
Super love the service from Justin! Thanks for surprising us with a slice of cake for our anniversary! :) The quality of food is average though and because Edge is hosting an Italian theme on the side (the international buffet stay put), i expected more Italian variety. However, Edge is generous with its seafood selection. A pity that I'm allergic to most seafood, especially shell fish. Overall, I'm happy that Justin was our server. He was really good and attentive, making our anniversary dinner extremely pleasant. Thank you Justin

It is a real disappointment that I write a negative review about Edge. I have eaten here on many occasions in the past and this is my return after a 2 year gap. It is very clear there are changes in the kitchen and cost cutting as the food was poor quality and menu items reflect that of a cheap family buffet.The buffet now reflects more a focus on quantity and not quality. The competition in Singapore is high and the Edge management need to have a deep dive into the entire operation to remain competitive and exceed guest expectations.Based on my poor experience we will not be returning as there are much better choices in Singapore
4
This was my second visit and I was impressed that the dinner spread is much wider and better than their lunch. Apart from the usual sashimi, they have fresh Canadian oysters, crab legs and chirashi don. The seafood are fresh and awesome! For cooked food, it was a little hit and misses. However, they win by having a wide variety of cuisine, there'll be something for everyone. There's roast meat, laksa, bak kut teh, pasta, pizza, Korean food, satay, grilled meat/sausages/prawns, Indian food, etc. They also had rojak, cheese platter and a good variety of cakes, nonya kueh, chocolate fondue, waffles, ice cream, etc. The buffet also comes with coffee or twg tea. Price for dinner buffet is expensive ($78++/pax) but it's good for gatherings and diners who enjoy variety.

Went to the Edge for dinner today to celebrate my nephew's 21st birthday. 17 of us. 15 adults and 2 children. The food was good and the view is superb (Singapore flyer just in front of us). The moment we stepped into the Edge, the front counter staff (the two Korean ladies) were so friendly. Mr Justin was in-charged of our table and he greeted us with a huge smile and explain to me the benefits that I am entitled as PanPac Privileges card member. 17 diners is a big group and he is very attentive and patience with all our requests. He top up the warm and cold waters many times and keep clearing the dirty dish from our table. Justin really made our day and we had excellent service. Justin was very conscientious about providing good service at the Edge and customer satisfaction. We really hope that the Edge could reward Justin in any form as he is such a gem to the Edge and I must say he will be reason for us to visit the Edge soon!!
4
After hearing about Edge from a friend who had stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel while attending a conference, my wife and I went to Edge for lunch. The lunch buffet was extensive and the food was very good.There are six or seven hot buffet stations with Western, Indian and Asian cuisine options at the different stations. There are two cold buffet stations with salads, cheeses, sushi and sandwiches. The is also a large dessert station.For a moderately priced but exceptional buffet, I recommend Edge
3
Have many choices of food.like the indian food. Dislike their pasta because the chef made wrong order. Requested a vegetarian pasta but got non vegetarian pasta. Like their desserts too but too small for me too bad they dont have italian wine + many vegetarian food
2
It was my 1st visit to this restaurant. Expected to have romantic dinner with my bf. But ended with bad experiences. 1st : the chef at pasta section cooked wrong pasta for me. I requested a vegetarian pasta. I said to him not to use slices of ham as wrote on the menu board & he answered ok mam. But the pasta that i got contain slices of ham.i didnt see the ham when i took a bite but i saw it after i stir the tobasco into pasta. I must wasted it because i couldnt eat it anymore. I hate waste my food. I went back to the chef &made complaint, he said sorry that he forgot my special request.2nd : i felt something wrong with red wine that we ordered because after i drank it 2 times, i got nausea, my heart beat very fast, felt very dizzy. I threw up at toilet twice. My bf also drank the wine & he said it taste weird.he sure the wine that cause me to get sick. He said sometimes people add a ingredient to sharpent the scent&taste of certain wine & i might have allergy of that ingredient.We must went back to hotel immediately. While waited for taxi, my body already felt very hot & i couldnt stand well without hold tight to my bf.The only good thing was your cakes taste delicious although it serve in very mini size.We felt very disappointed at that night. Totally screwed up our plan.our last night in sg
4
Mother's Day weekend, although the restaurant was fully booked the way it is set out it didn't feel busy. The staff were very attentive and the food stations had a great variety.
4
We had a few hiccups that Justin, our server, professionally resolved for us. So a special thanks to him!
Food choices were plenty and considerably good, although drink choices were limited.
Great service as well.
5
Very generous and tasty breakfast in the Pan Pacific Hotel. Amazing variety and array of food with something to suit any taste. Highly recommended.
4
Visited here at the start of a 3 week tour of Asia, having stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel in 2016. Singapore is expensive, but this restaurant allows you to sample the incredible range of cuisine from the Malay peninsular, Indian, Chinese and Japanese. Seafood is their speciality and my favourite, so I ate my way around the South Pacific!I was celebrating my birthday and so I was delighted when they served a huge chocolate cake with candles. Thanks for a great evening!
5
I dined with my family on 15th May at Edge as a belated Mother's Day present to my mum, and the experience was pleasant. The staff was polite and the food was great and my mum was very satisfied! We would definitely recommend it to our friends
4
The edge restaurant on the 4th floor of the Pan Pacific is just awesome. I had dinner there last night and the selection was great, service friendly and the price was reasonable. I would recommend it for groups, Coles or a quiet corner if you are travelling on your own
5
The Edge is located on the 3rd floor in the Pan Pacific hotel and was the breakfast buffet included in our room. The choices was huge and everything we tried was really good. We also had the buffet dinner and it was a Surf & Turf evening with great choices including crab and grilled steaks. But there was lots more. Wine and other beverages were at extra cost. Maybe a bit on the expensive side, but then again you had endless variety of great dishes
5
We had a brunch in Edge recently and very much enjoyed the broad and quality offering, the excellent champagne and the pleasant live, background music. Despite most tables being booked, there was no queues or waiting issues at all. Towards the end, we had a table visit from the Italian Chef, who gave us very interesting inisght into the preparation of some of the dishes and thanked us for coming. We will definitely be back for another occasion to enjoy this brunch again
5
My wife and I recently ate here and we were very impressed. For a set price we had access to a Surf and Turf buffet that was incredible.We had unlimited amounts of crab, orysters,other sea food and access to 6-7 other food stations serving different types of food. Also,seemingly unlimited amounts of wine was available.The Pan Pacific Hotel is visually impressive also.Definitely consider on a trip to Singapore
4
This is the third time we are having our Annual Company Dinner a the Edge. Never fail to impress us. Excellent Service and vast varieties of foods and desserts. Just cannot finish trying all. Special mention on service staff, Justin who display excellent customer service and respond to our needs appropriately
4
Ate here 2 times, the food was good both times. Lots of variety and plenty of food at all times. The staff was excellent as well.
5
Good service and food . Free cake for my birthday . Many varieties to choose . Will bring my family and friends next time.
3
The buffet is quite ordinary with mainly local food. Expected better service from a five star hotel but the staff seems to be only keen in clearing table !
5
Good buffet spread. Different cuisine. Seafood is fresh and dessert is good. I would love to go back again.
4
Good selection of food. Nice ambience and attentive service. One of the better buffet places and would definitely be back.
5
Great place, great Champagne, great service & in TOP of that a great executive Chef
So far my best experience in town
Thanks for this exceptional moment with my best friends
4
Attended Friend ROM private event with Buffet served . Very Good spread of Asian Oriental Food . Majority are tasting licking good . Love the Dessert of Durian puri and chocholate rum is fantastic to finish the sweet mouth. Feeling Very Satisfied .
4
TA needs a half rating and this would get between 3.5 to 4.I've been to Edge for many years, mostly for buffet dinners and sometimes champagne brunch. Not that I really love it that much. It's more because someone in the dining party requested for it and also I'm on their royalty program.The buffet mostly starts off on a good note. The seafood is mostly fresh. Quality of crab and oysters are good but I know of a better place. Somehow I managed to skip the sashimi counter for the past few times I was there. Cheese is acceptable, salad boring. Quality of meat at grill counter is just so-so, sometimes even bad. Cooked food section can be really bad and if it's not, it's just passable. Couple years ago the cooked food section was slightly better. Desserts are good but again can't match competitor's. What's unforgiveable? Cheap cordial drinks.On a good note, the waitresses were mostly pleasant and helpful - if you can catch hold of them. Also, it is true that it has a wide variety and although the quality is not the best it is still one of the better. And I like how you can pick your own greens and they'll stir fry it for you. That's one of the things I value about this place
2
One of the top restaurants in Singapore, a group of us visited the Edge for buffet. There were many stations with a wide variety of food. The dessert spread was good, especially the durian dessert and cakes. The prawns were very fresh. However, the scallop and other food were disappointing. Probably due to our high expectation, most of the dishes were only so-so, definitely not worth the price we paid ;
4
The buffet never fails to impress me. This time I went on a Thursday, slightly pricier but quality of food better. Staff were attentive and cleared my plates almost immediately each time. Didn't have the time to go to all stations as I was busy feasting on the crabs. Definitely a good place to get together and have a hearty meal.
4
went for weekday lunch buffet in a group of 8. Spread was good, so was ambience. No particularly tasty food, but all food was alright. A bit of a problem with a misunderstanding at billing, but nothing big.
4
Had breakfast on 3 days. Staff hassled and stressed. Loads of people, too many for me to be comfortable. Food is good, lots of different cuisines and most items were tasty. Service was just OK.
3
Service good, nice view, food okay, only crab is raw, online shown hv lamb chop and wagyu. So sad didnt have this
2
Not for Americans. Too much local food and not our taste for $150US. Very little real seafood, except for King crab legs. Not very friendly front desk staff.
5
The best buffet in the world. Fresh made to order juices. Fresh omeletes made to order. Everything tasty. Huge selection.
5
I celebrated my 36th birthday at Edge in Pan Pacific Singapore. Our reservation was processed smoothly by Janice Chan and I was given with a surprised birthday cake and the staffs sang Happy Birthday song for me. I love all the food selections especially the fresh oysters from Canada and King crabs. Steak was done right and satay are very delicious. I don't eat durian fruit but their durian dessert is awesome
2
Service by the counter was poor. Denying entry saying it was not time, but allowing other customers to enter the minute I sat down (which was directed by her). Bad attitude, and unfair treatment to diners. When doing payment, she didn't even check whose credit card it belonged to and just did a transaction. I understand it was a busy situation where many guests were leaving (two at the counter, one of them is myself), but she could've checked the owner of the cards before making invalid swipes. She didn't apologise for it and even showed attitude when it was our turn. But good point, the waiter had the perfect service, always ready to serve us, clearing our used utensils, he is Mr Muru, thumbs up to his wonderful service
3
I find it really difficult to rate it very good for several reasonsPro's: Service tried really hard to satisfy our needs, Champagne was refilled regularly , huge buffet - each section separately - sweets, sea food, cooked stuff and juice bar - one can almost get lost in there. Very friendly cooks and some cooked food quite nice while the beef wasn't particularly exiting.Seating is comfortable and view is nice towards singapore flyerCon's: the chef was not able to get us egg cup holder - he actually said, guests help themselves with a creme brûlée cup - what a joke for such a hotel (worst he said they got to in the first floor restaurant - why not bring some upstairs?)Live music - the bad was ok, but the sound system was so bad, that you could not hear the singer at all - after asking the manager he explained, that they could not adjust the system bcs then it starts tripping.However, I must say the floor manager as well as most serving staff was very friendly and well trained.Nice Kid's corner for kids available which is a plus!In general it wasn't a bad experience, but if i compare to other locations in Singapore at that level - there is room for improvement
3
I have been a regular customer with the Edge restaurant in Pan Pacific Hotel Singapore because I enjoyed their wide range of food served in the buffet lunch or dinner. Another reason is the excellent service provided by the staff ranging from the higher level Managers to the lower level cleaners. However recently I found that the quality of some buffet dishes are not consistently good. For example, the pork ribs soup was very salty at one of my dinner and it was fine in another time. Also the size of the fresh scallops varies on different days. I hope the hotel could improve in the quality control of their buffet dishes
5
Sundays or weekends there is an all you can eat buffet night, and you will eat all you can. It's varied - literally an entire restaurant full of food - with food from Europe, SEA, East Asia etc. plus an amazing dessert area. Felt like rolling out after about 9 plates each
5
Nice ambience with quality foo. It's a place suitable not only for business purposes, nice nice for family or friends gathering
5
Great spread, comfortable seats. Seafood offered was definitely on a higher quality compared to most buffet restaurants.
4
I took my parents for the dinner buffet and they both enjoyed the service and variety of food offered. The seafood was fresh and portions were generous. The dessert spread was especially well received by the two elders. We had a good time.
5
The food there was scrumptious. We had a wonderful time there. It was one of the best buffets I had ever had!!
5
This place has the best Buffett I have ever eaten at and this includes 3 trips to Vegas!All the Vue Cliqout Champagne you can drink we tried to empty every bottle until we ran out of time. The menu included all types of food sea food,Italian ,Asian, prime rib,rib eye you name it they had the price was probably $250 USD for two I think we drank that in Champagne alone. The service and food were excellent and the pours very generous!Just note a 10% service charge is included on all bills I asked the server is the tip included she said No. I do t think she understood what I was asking. As a result I added an extra 20% to the bill no big deal the service and food was great. This was our first day in Asia I didn't make that mistake again. Probably her best tip of the month 30% . Worth a trip no doubt and I would go again
3
Having Friday brunched in Dubai many a time, we didn't think we could visit Singapore without giving their Sunday offering a go. It was the same concept, 4 hours of all you can eat and drink, this particular one including Veuve Cliquot champagne, which was a plus.There was a wide and varied selection of food, from breakfast items, to a seafood bar and a giant cheeseburger. It was difficult to know where to start. Tried out the sushi rolls and tempura, they were OK, not great but passable. Also tried the Indian selection, which was really tasty. The giant burger was a bit of a disappointment, was stone cold and not all that good, I suppose it was more of a novelty.The drinks selection was decent, although there was some confusion over which wines were included and which were not, there was also beer and cocktails on offer. Overall, it was an enjoyable afternoon of eating and drinking. It didn't blow me away, there was no fantastic view or stand out food items and service was average, it sometimes took some time to get glasses re-filled and plates cleared
4
This is my go-to restaurant. I've been to Edge several times and have been let down by the service only once and that was down to a rather grumpy staff. My most recent visit in March was once again excellent, with great quality food, good variety, and wonderful service by a cheerful young staff member. The buffet price though has risen too much too quickly, from a very reasonable $38 to a high $52 within just a few years. Eg. The buffet lunch per head had been $48++ in Jan this year but just two months later, it had risen to $52++.
5
Just had a wonderful dinner with my family after our ROM. The one thing I really wanted to highlight was the services provided by the restaurant. The whole team was polite and gave us warm smiles and attention throughout the whole dinner. I think the services is what this restaurant differentiate from the others when you have a tight breaker with another top notch restaurant. Especially Mr Justin, he is professional and the services provided by him was the best that I have encountered so far. Good services is also one of the reasons I have chosen the Edge (again) to celebrate our once in a life time occasion. My whole family totally agreed to the world class standard services and I really hope you can keep up with this till I return next time
2
I have been to The Edge over the years and I have noticed the the quality of food have detoriated. When I was there last, the sashimi was fair. The fruits were bad and I told the Chef and he said that they were "taken from downstairs"? So does that mean it should be bad. The meat selection was poor even for the price point. The things that were ok was the durian puff, pohpiah and curry fish. The Korean waiters were just looking around. Not going back for sure

Wasn't sure about Edge at first as it appeared that this restaurant was just dime a dozen. The choices of food were amazing and well curated. Its dining area was spacious. Most importantly its staff served with a smile. Well done Edge. I believe I'll see you soon again
4
Enjoyed a number series of food. Disappointed with the pasta and sashimi as they were watery or lack in quality
4
Visited this restaurant for team lunch, buffet spread was good, it varies from fruits, deserts and Japanese.
Desert items were too good.
Little improvement required on asian selection.
5
We always have lunch or dinner in edge. We like the seafood buffet dinner. Today we went to edge again, total 10 guests. We all enjoy the lunch, prawn, salmon, durian purée... we will go back again soon.
5
Excellent quality food all the way from appetizers to desert. Different kinds of cuisine.
Will come back !
5
No doubt one of the TOP buffets in town. Food, Ambience, Service all excellent! Variety and quality of food above par. The various live stations are what differentiates a great buffet from a mediocre one. Fresh, tasty and excellent spread! Must go again!

Whilst visiting the CanJam show in the Pan Pacific Hotel in Marina Bay I went to "Edge" for some lunch. I had some fresh shrimp which were okay followed by a dozen pieces of Chicken Satay... Now I've had a fair amount of Chicken Satay in my time and that served at Edge was very average and feel rather short of my expectations. Edge is also felt like a cafe rather than a restaurant, rather open plan, casual and lacking a great deal of ambiance. Also for an average lunch is was quire expensive at SG$41.20 (circa GBÂ£25) including a 750ml bottle of sparkling water (which was SG$10). I don't think I would bother to eat here again
5
Very good spread for lunch buffet, simply spoiled by the selections. There is fresh seafood, japanese sashimi, roast meats, italian, indian and awesome dessert bar. The dark rum chocolate is must try for chocolate lovers.Ambience is great with loads of natural lighting in the restaurant. Service staff are very friendly. Highly recommend to dine here and do make reservations
5
This was the perfect buffet for our group of 8 people. We had some picky eaters who were very happy with the Western foods on offer. The rest of us went with all of their Asian food offerings. Everything from Singaporean, Indian, Chinese, fresh seafood, Sushi, noodle soup made custom for you, fresh stir fry of your choice and even a lovely dessert section. Good value for price and a decent wine list as well
5
We choosed this AUCE resto based on tripadvisorbefore i booked the table from tripadvisor also and i had request for gave us great table with romantic view since its our 3rd anniversaryAnd we got nice table with great view thank you!!They have many many choices of food since its buffet style.. most of menu was seafood.. My favourite was oyster and suckling pig which is very very tastyyy and tender!! Price is expensive but worth itStaff also good and helpfulll also polit
4
Pretty good spread and food was well prepared. Western to japanese to chinese to malay to indian. They have it all. Perhaps just a little shorthanded. Clearing of plates were slower than expected in hotels. But its bearable. We had a good time and we wanna be back again. And the uob offer made it even better!
5
Had a lovely evening meal here. It was good local cuisine in the form of a buffet. You know somewhere is of good quality when it is patronised by locals.
Buffet was to,mark end of Chinese New Year.
5
Great food from meats and fishes up to smaller snacks. Must visit restaurants with great ambiance, friendly stuff, and comfortable seats
4
Food was good, excellent service by Jean. Perhaps it was Valentines Day hence the price was on a higher end. Menu was thereabout the same when I had it on a weekend. Love the ambience!
5
Food was great. Many choices available. Staff service was very polite and courteous. Plates were cleared fast. Really well worth the money spent.
5
This is our 4th visit to the restaurant to celebrate a birthday. Service is excellent and consistent. Amazing food variety that is always changing to surprise you!
3
Honestly, if this is one of the better buffetsI wouldn't want to try the others. Food pretty average and some surely staff. Not worth the equivalent of £66 a head.
5
I visited for dinner with my friend on 16 of febThe setting of edge is spacious clean and there are so nice food selection.Actually i'd like to highlight staff service name of haley who is korean ladyThat time was quite busy even if she had a lot of things to do she keep focused on service. Really im pressed. Cus i never ask her anythings like top up the water,clear the plate, coffee tea. She just automatically service to us. Service were here.Anyway thank u for served us haley
4
The selections on offer are amazing, it seems that every food group and nationality is represented. The hot food was hot and the cold food served at the right temperature.The quality of food was good, although I found the seafood a bit bland. Not to matter there were many other foods on offer. The pick was the suckling pig
5
Wow! Buffet was great! Sooo many good foods to choose from with cuisines from all over the world! A "made to order" grill area, sushi / sashimi / oyster bar, cheese bar, and a huge dessert bar as well! The food was fantastic! We were a group of 14 and the waitress was extremely attentive, clearing our dirty places and ensuring we had fresh silverware. Would recommend! But make sure you come hungry! And great view of MBS and the Flyer!
4
I have eaten from the a la carte menu and the buffet spread. If you want a hearty buffet spread with quality offerings, you will be at the right place. The a la carte menu is small as they focus a lot on the buffet both breakfast, lunch and dinner. The buffet spread is so huge and it goes from Chinese to Malay to Indian good. It's fantastic! Worth every dollar... if you can eat
3
There Feb 1, 2017 looking for lunch and found the buffet open for 20 minutes. Bountiful but suffering from being out under lamps; got my money's worth with peel your own shrimp, lobster & sushi. Beef roast was good. Cost 48$ including tip/tax.
5
A truly outstanding breakfast.
So much choice and of a very very high quality. The front of house staff were very attentive and the chefs on each stall were excellent. Can't wait for breakfast tomorrow!!!
5
The buffet spread and selection was extensive and delicious. I brought my mother here for her birthday and she was extremely happy.
4
I always loved a buffet spread with lots of choices to savour. Edge is no exception. I loved the seafood, especially the oysters. Service staff were friendly and attentive. Would come back again.
5
We appreciated the great choice, first class food and excellent service. Our daughter keeps praising the desserts and urges us to go back to Pan Pacific on our next trip to SIN...
4
Enjoyed our champagne Sunday brunch at the Edge. Great choice of dishes from Western and Eastern foods. Service was good , polite and attentive but we did have to wait a long time for credit cards to be brought back which is always disconcerting. The live music was great but we were quite close to them so conversation was difficult at times. Children dancing in front of us irritated some of us. Quite expensive but would go again for special occasion .
3
Came late to buffet but if advertised as open should still keep it going properly till 10-30pmSeafood looked not fresh Much of hot food was Luke warm e.g. Pizza Desserts too sweet - no subletyAsked for 2nd glass of water - it never came
2
This used to be my favourite Sunday Champagne Brunch in Singapore. The spread is comprehensive and includes many foods no other hotel does in Singapore. However, I felt let down by the hotel on my most recent visit. I was with my wife and 1 month old son plus a group of about 10 friends. The brunch runs from 12-4pm but at 2pm a waiter asked us to settle the bill as they had concerns we were going to run off without paying (?!). Not sure how that impression was manifested and the idea of us trying to run away with a baby, pram and everything would be laughable if it wasn't so insulting. Secondly my wife was having the non alcoholic brunch but asked to have a single glass of Rosé a la carte (and willing to pay of course). The waiter rally struggled with this idea and it took us reminding him on two separate occasions before he said there is no Rosé available. Again saying we'd like to pay for it a la carte his response was simply the hotel doesn't stock any Rosé wine at all. Seems far fetched to me. Lastly when we closed the bill out it we had to wait about 45mins before our credit card was returned and we could leave.A real shame as I don't think I'll be going back again due to such rude and bad service
4
I was looking for Japanese wagyu beef and the google result threw up the Edge. Saw they had Omi wagyu and decided to make a reservation via Chop. Process was smooth and the service was great when i showed up. They had a live band for the Sun brunch session. Great music and they even accept requests. Food spread was good. You have your usual cold section with all the seafood, local, international, japanese and dessert spread. I love the seafood section the best. The omi wagyu was a let down. Was quite ordinary but then again, it's a buffet spread so maybe i was expecting too much. But i had a good time. Might go back again. The service was great. The server was friendly and plates were cleared promptly
4
there is plenty of food stations here, got chinese, indian, jap, asian, dessert, pizza, bread, fruits, cheese and many more. always a fav to eat at this place, be it breakfast or lunch. the laksa was good n the satay was well grilled. also the dessert, durian pengat was excellent. the seafood was also pretty good spread n fresh. never fail to disappoin
5
Everybody was impressed by the quality of food and service rendered by the restaurant staff, especially the cashier and our area waiter Justin. A wide selection of food items, very fresh seafood. Very proactive staff members to fulfill our requests. Will definitely come back.
4
Food was very decent, the buffet had almost all the cuisines you can think of. Service was impeccable. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
5
This is most definately the best buffet that i have ever been too. It has a wide selection of almost everything you can think of. High quality food at affordable price in magnificent setting. I would 100% reccomend anyone visiting singapore to come here.
5
The selection of food was huge. All was excellent quality with a variety of international cuisines. Make sure you are hungry when you go so you can sample them all!
5
Great atmosphere and suitable for large group and corporate event. Lots of selection, from Japanese to western to Chinese, Indian vegetarian and many small surprises and not forgetting the dessert area
5
This brunch is amazing. I highly recommend getting a reservation ahead of time. There are 16 brunch stations, a cocktail bar, a mimosa bar, and bottomless mimosas.
5
High-quality buffet. Worth every penny. Wide selection of foods and unlimited mimosa. Foie gras was so good.
5
I ate here for breakfast and lunch on numerous occasions during a trip to Singapore. I'm normally skeptical and unimpressed with buffets, however this one far surpassed all expectations.It has a number of different 'stations' with different types of cuisine. Indian, Thai, Japanese, American, Italian etc as well a an entire dessert station.The food is of excellent quality and the service was extremely friendly and efficient.It's not authentic Singapore street food but i'd happily eat here again if staying at this hotel
5
This is our 3rd visit to the Edge and it has become a family favorite. We enjoy the wide range of food and good quality. Typically it is very popular due to the price, selection and quality. The staff is always attentive in clearing plates and bring drink items that we order. I get a bit humored when they emphasize that it will be an additional charge for say a Coke. Highly recommend it for family and business lunches
5
Buffet style, great variety from around the world, which was very well presented and the staff helpful and efficient. On one of the nights a seafood buffet was the theme, along with the rest of the cuisine. Eat to your hearts content. We felt it was good value for the money. Would book a table when visiting again
3
Food variety are impressive, however the whole area are too huge, need to walk quite a bit to get your food and return back to the table. Service was minimum due to huge crowd of guests.
2
The food at Edge was not as appealing as it used to be. Our family were rather disappointed with the limited selections in our recent visit to the restaurant when we stayed at the hotel in December 2016
4
What a lovely spread of international, Asian and local dishes. Wonderful buffet with great food and standard. "Chefs" at some stations are not exactly very polite. But overall, great food and atmosphere. Excellent dessert corner.
5
Was impressed with the really good spread at the buffet. So many different choices and they also have an excellent dessert counter too.
5
Visited here for the first time with my boyfriend for Christmas lunch. We had the 12-2 sitting. Seated on time. Staff very friendly and attentive. We opted for free-flow option and my glass was never empty! LOTS of choice - bread, cheese, salad, sea-food, raclette, Chinese, Singaporean, American, Mexican, roasts meats, desserts, chocolate, ice-cream, juice bar, cocktail bar.Great lunch in beautiful surroundings. Dry easy to move about and make selections. You can take some sticks from your table and give it to the chefs at the stations and they will make your dish fresh and bring it to your table.Edge at Pan Pacific is highly recommended by us
2
The spread was wide but overall cooking and quality were mediocre. I went home with stomach cramps and acute diarrhoea!I did not finish my first & only platter of salmon belly sashimi as I found it 'flat'. I had a couple of oysters (some had bits of shell in them) & king crab legs (some pieces were overly salty).The chinese stir fry vegetables were salty while the mushrooms had a bitter aftertaste. The laksa gravy has the taste & consistency of curry noodle gravy. The Indian vegetables were oily & not well spiced. The roast beef carving was my staple throughout the dinner. Parts of the roast beef was overcooked, had to request for medium rare cuts on my subsequent rounds. The beef jus was commendable. Dessert spread & taste was average. The rum filled chocolate was a winner
4
Really wide spread. Greedy to try everything, but really can't stuff everything in. Enjoyed the alaskan king crab legs (some pieces tad salty though) n grilled lamb chop as well as beef. The wagyu rump at the carving was unfortunately overcooked n dry. Wat a pity. Service is prompt n friendly n there is a also a wide range of desserts. The soft chocolate with rum is my fav by far! Thanks for a really nice dinner! Edge is definitely amongst the top buffets in SG imo
1
Considering this restaurant is so expensive, the standard should be so much higher. The staff were miserable and so unhelpful. They don't tell you anything. The buffet is not impressive at all. The sushi had finished by 9:30pm and no one topped it up even though the restaurant closes at 10:30pm. When we asked for a waffle, the waiter just picked up one that was already out and re-heated it rather than giving a fresh one. We complained to the manager who actually said he agrees that the service was terrible and that we should come back the next day because the staff will be different! Surely all your staff should be trained to serve at an equally high standard?? The experience was appalling and was a total waste of our evening - especially when you're only visiting for a few days and want every moment to be special. Our biggest regret of our whole holiday was that we chose to have dinner at this restaurant
3
The Edge has always done well in having a really good spread and variety, while maintaining high quality. This is my 3rd time returning to this place and I'm rather disappointed with the service and food quality during the Christmas season. Seems like a lot of work needs to be put in managing crowds. Firstly, finger bowl was not served to us (when usually it would be). Secondly, the tea served taste worse than what i can get from fast food restaurant (Note: The last time when I had the tea, it was served with individual tea packs and it tastes fresh and nice). The spread is good as always, however, the cray fish does not seem as fresh as the last time i visit. Overall I have way better experience in my last two visit this year. I sincerely hope that The Edge will maintain it's previous standard as it is still I place I wish to visit again next round
5
Spent 24 hours laying over in Singapore on the final night of my month long trip in asia. I wanted to go big and make sure I got one last taste of everything before heading back to the states. I had high expectations coming here and they were all met and exceeded. Great seafood station with the standards along with very thick cut sashimi, also great grill, noodle and dessert station. Worth the price of $68usd when you use a Citibank brand credit card for 10%discoun
4
Returning to our favourite spot for another Champagne brunch at Edge. A bit more expensive during December but a very nice spread of Christmas dishes.
5
Lots of variety of food! Food taste is fantastic! Paid $72++ for each pax for Sunday dinner. Child under 6 eat for free. Uob card has 20% discount. Car park complimentary ticket as well!
4
Spread of food is totally amazing. Totally love the varieties they have - from oysters & seafood bar to sashimi to indian and international spread, with roast lamb, grilled wagyu beef and roast turkey too. It is valued for price on the buffet. Improvement can be made on taste factor as my friends felt some of their dishes are too heavily salted. The ambience and staff were great and very attentive and fast to attend to our needs. One compliment is to the young chef at the ice cream section, he portrays patience and poise with an irritating customer who taunt him about not making own ice cream. Remarking that ice cream are so easily made, hence chef like him should make Pan PAc's own ice cream. The young chef kept his cool and served him well. Kudos to the young chef.

Visited with a group of friends 18 in total and had a fantastic champagne lunch. The seafood was mainly cold which is fine but it was rather bland. Wished there were some warm seafood options too. Some of the meat options like the baby lamb I found rather tough but the prime rib and pork was delicious. Overall, the food range was impressive but no single dish stood out. So I guess, all were average to above average but none were the best in any. The champagne was flowing non stop for the duration of the meal and the staff accommodated our split bill effortlessly. Which is always handy in a large group. I would probably not do it again as it was very expensive but would recommend it to anyone who have not been.

My wife and I went to this restaurant during our stay at Pan Pacific. We thought it's a must since it has such a high rating and it's our honeymoon. We reserved a table but when we arrived the staff had no clue. They gave us a table at the side despite asking for a table with a view. The waitress sat us down and walked off without explaining what the process is to order food. I had to approach the staff myself to get a menu and then found out it's a buffet. They themselves said we should opt for the buffet since their A La Carte menu is small. We were not given a drinks menu at all. Most food at the stations had run out by half 9 for example the sushi. Also no one told us the restaurant closes at half 10. The staff at each station were not helpful at all. I was told if I take my table number to a counter and ask for pasta, they will make it for me and bring it to my table but none of the other staff seemed to know. I left not knowing where the pasta was. I asked for a waffle at the waffle counter but the waiter just heated a waffle that had been out for ages rather than giving me a fresh one. Also you don't get clean cutlery between plates. You use the same knife and fork you used for mains for dessert. Overall a terrible experience! So disappointed with the service and food. Will not be going there ever again

We had a family dinner here in December, and the overall experience is good - I especially like the following: (1) Service here is good, and compatible with the standard of a 5-star restaurant (2) Food quality is above average and the food choices are diverse - Where you can enjoy a great sample of both international and local food (3) Location wise - It is in Pan Pacific Hotel adjacent to the Suntec City, a large mall with plenty of things to see and buy, where after a full day of strolling through the mall and experiencing the large fountain in the middle of the mall, it is a good time to come by for a nice buffet dinner and relaxed for the next 2-hour+ before heading back to hotel or home.Good to call ahead to get make a reservation (6826-8240) esp. if it is during the weekend. The restaurant does serve buffet for lunch or dinner - Hence, you can come by for lunch as well, except the spread may be smaller compared to dinner.Do take note that it is a bit pricey (> S$ 90/pax for dinner) - but once awhile you can indulge yourself for a nice dinner and a session to chill out with friends or family, or simply yourself in rewarding yourself with some "me-time with good food and drinks
5
Just had a really great meal st pan pac, the Edge. Other than the good spread of food and desserts, i have to compliment that the service was excellent. Plates were cleared promptly. Water and coffee were topped up without asking. Service staff Justin was very good at what he was doing. Thank you for wonderful experienc
5
Edge was always a go to Sunday Brunch when we lived in Singapore so decided we would go again with friends when visited Singapore last month. It was still fantastic. The choice of buffet is outstanding & they now offer champagne cocktails as well as free flow VC. Nice setting too, however if your going with all adults request to be seated away from the children's area which can get a bit noisy!
3
I would not pay separately for breakfast at the Edge in the Pan Pacific unless you can get a deal with your room. Baked beans and eggs, pastries and many international cuisines catered for, but overall there are not many viable alternatives in the area. Just be sure to get a deal when you book your room
1
We found Edge on Trip Advisor's list of restaurants in Singapore, rated #7 out of 8500. First off, to keep this fair, the restaurant was elegant and upscale. That's basically where the positives of the experience ended. For the hefty S$98, we were expecting top notch service and excellent food. The staff was cold, impersonal, and didn't smile much when coming to our table. The chips at the ceviche section were stale and we paid S$9 for a canned coke! Considering the high price, sodas and other non-alcoholic beverages should be included. The two pasta carbonaras ordered were extremely salty and the scallops that came out were undercooked a couple of times. My group visited from the United States and we were celebrating Thanksgiving. Five out of 8 of us got sick later that evening with bad stomach aches. We came into dinner with high hopes and excitement only to leave incredibly disappointed and a one way ticket to the bathroom all night
5
Visited 3 days ago with my wife for Lunch Buffet, The spread was amazing with wide variety of choices and had lots to choose from from different cuisines.
4
The experience was a Very enjoyable one, as the staff were very friendly and efficient! food spread was also very wide.
5
Really enjoy the buffet with the view. Can see the Singapore flyer when dining.
Like the dessert bar
5
The choice of food is excellent, just that this is the festive theme, therefore there is no Rojak or local dessert during this time, which were our favourites.
5
Great variety of international food, Asian delights and desserts. Good and fresh food. Was there to celebrate daughter's birthday and the staff served her a nice birthday cake sang her birthday song too! Nice will return again.
4
This is my 2nd visit to Edge. Food is good and atmosphere is nice and cosy. The rice (not sure whether it is pumkin rice) I tried in my 1st visit is extremely good whereby my 11 years old girl also like it. This time the rice available was something like the bean rice, also very unique and excellent. It is good that the restaurant makes changes as and when so frequent diners can have a different experience of the food. Besides that, also like the Satay and durian pudding, always go for many rounds. Lastly, I am not a pizza lover but the pizza serve is extremely good. Not to forget my 2nd visit was sitting near the window, the photos taken with the Singapore Flyer background were beautiful 
5
It was my father's birthday, my family and I went to Edge to have dinner.When we went in, the service staff were very friendly and they led us to our reserved table.We started walking around and taking our food.There were a lot of food to choose from. The food was delicious. My favourite was the seafood and sorbet. After we had finished the food, the waiter gave us a small cake as my dad was a Pan Pacific member.It is now one of my favourite restaurants.I would like to complement Peter for his excellent service. He was attentive to our needs and very patience to answer our queries
5
we had the buffet dinner and it was one of the best we ever had! First, the huge variety of themed tables was overwhelming but we quickly found our favourite dishes. While there was a huge offer of meat, pasta & noodle etc., we mainly ate seafood because it was so amazing. Even the desserts where very good (and we have a very high standard of those) the good service added up to an amazing evening. We would definitely come again
5
Even a regular dish like Rojak tasted great! If they bother to panggang the you-cha-kuey for the rojak.. obviously they are proud of what they serve! Those huge Alaskan crab legs were sweet n firm in flesh! Oooh finish off with a scoop of coffee vanilla ice cream over the crunchiest waffle! Heaven!!!the sausages were so good I dropped by the Pacific Marketplace and bought some home
5
My friends and I enjoyed our dinner tremendously at The Edge today (21 Nov). Justin Kan served us throughout our dinner. He was courteous, prompt in clearing our plates and was attentive to details. The moment he saw my friend start taking dessert, he immediately offered coffee/tea for my friend. Excellent service provided by him! Keep up the good work
5
Great variety of cuisines, really enjoyed the fresh seafood. Excellent service and staff members were very nice especially Justin. We were there for a birthday dinner and he was very helpful, prepared a cake and we had a great time there.
5
Great selection of food choices! Spoilt for choice!
Very good service! Thoroughly enjoyed the peranakan buffet lunch!
4
Nama chocolates were handmade and basically the star of the night. Grilled section was not bad too. However sashimi failed to impress and oysters were not freshly shucked and quite small. The ambience was terrific though. Would recommend at least to go once.
4
Food is nice with a lot of Southeast Asian style choices. If you're a dessert lover, you won't be disappointed as well. Service is up to standard and if you're full, tried their tea from TWG.
5
One the best buffet restaurant in town. Very good and interesting spread. Good chef service too. Only regrets is the cashier service is slow and it take ages to settle the bill. The waiters also start disappearing towards late night.
5
Been to The Edge once earlier this year to celebrate my sister's and dad's birthdays! Enjoy the food selection and hence went back again for my birthday with my friends this time! Staff are consistently warm and friendly. We ask one of them to help us take a group photo and she even suggested to us where to stand to get a good view of the Flyer at the background! Thumbs up! If you like seafood, The Edge has a wide spread of selection from fresh oysters, Alaska crabs, clams, lobsters, prawns etc to sashimi. They also do barbecue for some of the seafood and all are equally fresh! The place can be crowded on weekend, so do reserve in advance. They also serve coffee and teas. The cordial drink was a little diluted though. The dessert corner is really quite a spread too! They also serve other cuisines such as Western, Korean, Chinese and Indian curries! Price is high versus average buffet but the spreads are the reason and hence it is reasonable!
5
This is one of the best champagne brunch I had in my life! There are so many choices to choose from. All sorts of oysters, meat, salad, bread, dessert etc. I wished I had a bigger stomach! Go with an empty stomach so you can stuff yourself. :
4
The food are okay only but the service by the staff Saran Raj was excellent. Extremely fast and attentive. Keep up the good work and service. He should be a leader among the service staff. Thank you so much for the service and is worth to celebrate our 3 generations birthday again next year at the hotel again
5
Got to be the best hotel buffet lunch in Singapore! Wide variety of food options spread across internationally. Food quality was not jeopardise despite the huge range of food choices. Food options from local laksa, roasted delights, salad bar, indian delights, italy pizza, pasta, german pork knuckles, japanese sashimi, chiraishi rice, fresh seafood and so on! Not forgetting to give special compliments to staff Janice and Peter who gave great service throughout our meal, and even offer a mini cake for my aunt as it was her birthday celebrations! Such friendly and feel like home experience really made us feel so warm. Thanks Pan Pacific Edge!
5
Big sprawling place with a great spread of food of various cuisines!Suitable for all ages and tastebuds!The food are however spread out over a large area so some walking will be needed to get what you like!Nonetheless the spread will make it worth your while!Great ambience and not noisy
5
Selection of food was wide and delicious. In addition, the staff were courteous and attentive to my needs.
4
Great food.Friendly staff.Very good service.The best place for brunch in the city.Crab!! Lobster!!!.
5
We had an amazing brunch and as usual it did not disappoint.
Service was very thoughtful and attentive.
Food selection is awesome and quality top notch.
Nothing to fault.
Hope to be back soon...again.
3
Not much choice of the food. Went there for my Husband birthday but my Husband doesn't like. Not worth the money
4
Wide & fresh selection.
Breakfast spread has good variety.
Lunch buffet has both hot & cold selection, prompt replenishment.
5
Amazing spread - never ending rows of stations. Carnivores would love the grill station. Fresh seafood is incredible - crab, prawns, oysters etc Asian as well as western favourite dishes. Amazing.
5
This is my 2nd time to The Edge and it certainly lived up to my experience again. The spread is fantastic. I could choose from Korean (which was so authentic), Chinese, Western, Japanese, local, etc. The seafood was so fresh and everything from the savoury to sweet tasted so good. The service staff attending to us is very fast and efficient. The whole ambience was so lovely and we ended up sitting there for 3 hours without realizing it. I would definitely be back again
4
went there with my friends.. and took buffet so I can try lot of food there.. they have buffet or a la carte, the seafood they serve is great and not fishy.. I love jpnese food.. but they didnt serve chawanmushi.. :( too bad..for wagyu, the meat is too dry not juicy at all.. I love the decorating, quite simple but elegance.. not too noisy and the ambience is goo!so overall, we had nice dinner there..was such a great fine dining
4
The Edge serves succulent Seafood Buffet on every Wednesday and Thursday. I had dinner with my family on Thursday and we truly enjoyed the wide variety of seafood. There were lobsters, Alaska king crabs, scallops which were free flowed from the ice counter, just to name a few of the marine harvest. I personally also like the pan fried mud crabs with salted egg yolks paste as it's was the right combination to bring out the sweetness and fragrance of the crab meat. By the time we finished the seafood, we have little room for the desserts which were also interestingly good for our taste buds, such as cream brulee, and a variety of flavoured cakes and pastries. Lastly I would like to mention the excellent service provided by the friendly staffs of the restaurant which has made a lasting memory for my family and myself. Cheers to all the staffs
5
We recently had a networking dinner here and Justin, the service staff, was extremely accommodating to our party of 21 pax, making sure we were comfortable with the seating arrangement and was attentive throughout dinner.We were overwhelmed by the incredible and whopping buffet spread - we just didnâ€™t know where to start because we want to try everything from International to Seafood, Local, and Peranakan! Ambiance was perfect too, not too noisy or chaotic and many were there with family and kids
5
Excellent service. Friendly staff. Good food. Especially Syabil and Seri very cheerful. They gave a cake for my kids birthday and even joined us to sing birthday song.
5
We recently enjoyed the 'Surf & Turf' buffet at PPH & it was so wonderful! Incredible variety & everything was so tasty. Very fresh seafood & so many drool worthy dishes! So many staff on hand to assist & refresh plates etc.
5
One of the best buffets u can find in Singapore . Range of food was excellent and value for money. Service was good too
5
The service at Edge was great, staff were all friendly and always greeting you with a smile! :) I love the variety of food! Been to both lunch and dinner spread. Although the lunch did not have the live BBQ section, the spread was still great

Fresh seafood, good local food (especially the Indian food), and awesome desserts (must try the green tea red bean ice cream). They have a lot of variety to choose from and the services provided there was very good. The only complaint is that they ran out of chicken satay at the end. :
5
One of the best champagne brunches I have had . Caviar, crab, lobster. Excellent salads. Wonderful choice of international flavours including Chinese, Indian, Italian and much more. Special mention for the risotto, it was exceptional. A great selection of cocktails, wine, beer and champagne. Do yourself a favour and have Sunday brunch here
5
Cheerful staff very attentive & accommodating. Re-seated us when we requested for a sofa seat. A well planned menu with a wide selection of food & desserts. A great place to chill for a casual outing or a special occassion. Would like to thank Cris, Engelia & Charmaine for being so attentive to my booking details.
5
The service was excellent and impeccable! Staffs were dedicated and friendly. I would to give a big shout and thumbs up to Mr Syabil was extremely attentive and accommodating for our table. We felt so pampered! It was a birthday gathering for my family and we totally had a great time. The staffs were so professional, included the guest relations officer at Edge's reception. Furthermore, we were so impressed with the wide spread of cuisines and environment setting was so comfortable! I canâ€™t wait to come back again
5
I had a great dining experience at The Edge with my friends and family. Not to mention the great variety and tasty food that caters to many people, their high-quality service gave us a feeling of home. Hence, I would like to especially thank Surash. E, the staff who serve us during the dinner. He is friendly, caring and polite. Thank you The Edge
5
From the moment we arrived and were greeted by the lovely 'Janice' it was an absolute joy.I wasn't 100% happy with the table allotted, with out any drama, we were happily re-seated in a booth nearer the carvery station.Now........Let the wonder commence.The first tempter was the giant beef burger slices, sound un appealing, well think again!!!the first mouthful takes you to ooh and ahhh and this is amazing. and that was the start of a thoroughly wonderful afternoon of free flow Vuerve Clicot champagne and everything from seafood, glorious king crab claws to duck pancakes to dainty desserts and oh so much more.i would challenge anyone who does not highly recommend the Edge to all their friends and family. thank you for a glorious afternoon and we will be back again!!!
5
Justin, the staff who serve us is great, he is caring, friendly and warm when he serve. We enjoy our dinner very much. Thank you very much Justin.
5
Greeted by the friendly and warm staff. Variety of fresh, succulent and delicious food and not forgetting the yummy dessert spread. A very pleasant and wonderful evening with my love.
5
one of the best buffets with wide selection and great quality food. always my top choice for a good treat
5
wow, what a breakfast buffet, you name it , it was there, really well presented, good quality we were staying in the hotel and had breakfast every day there.
4
Compliments to Justin for taking care of my family and I during our meal at the Edge.
Thank you for the birthday cake and candle.
5
Had a great time with my friends at The Edge, having great food and dining ambience. Would like to give a special shout out to Justin the waiter at The Edge, really appreciate his service and very impressed of how vigilant and meticulous he is. Thank you so much for your quality service, making our time at The Edge a smooth and enjoyable one! Will definitely be back again in the near future!
5
The Sunday brunch at the Edge can easily be characterized as an event to be experienced and enjoyed. A four hour “happening” of gastronomical delight. The sea food station, foie gras, prime rib, endless fresh apple and ginger juice, the satay selections were but a few of the brunch offerings on our favorites list. The live music in the background, the attentiveness of the wait staff, the quantity and quality of the food, all combined to make this one of the most wonderful Sunday brunches we have had in a long, long time. Looking forward to doing this brunch again next time we pass through Singapore
3
Great selection of food offerings from across the globe with emphasize on Asian cuisine. Gets busy during lunch hours from company employees located in the vicinity. The price is definitely competitive, but I would actually seek out individual restaurants specializing in certain cuisines rather than one restaurant that gives you all but leaves wondering if there are better ones out there. Attentive service
5
We chose to have breakfast here each morning rather than at Pacific Club and it did not disappoint. There was so much choice and the food was delicious. There was no long waits in queues for the hot buffet and they had 3-4 staff cooking your eggs how you like them for a speedy service.
4
Touted to have the longest Sunday brunch in Singapore at 4 hours, Edge leaves an impression with its magnificent spread of food station ranging from Local, Chinese, Malay, Indian, Western, Carvery, Grill, Cheese, Japanese, Dessert. From the awesome mongolian suckling pig, truffle tasting cold angel hair, giant burger which is bigger than my hands and the unique swiss raclette cheese. Though there were misses as well like the maine lobsters which ran out at the first hour and was replaced with crayfish, interestingly, the signboard of maine lobster was taken away and not replaced with a signboard that says crayfish for that. For its spread and its value, Edge is the perfect place to introduce somebody to the world of Sunday Champagne Brunch
5
They prepared a surprise b'day cake for my GF... Really provided a excellent service throughout our dinner
5
Great spread of buffet and fresh seafood including oysters and sashimi. Their service are prompt and love dinning here. In fact we come here for most occasions
5
All-you-can-eat plus more that you know you shouldn't. Have you ever had braised duck for breakfast alongside your made on the spot omelette and bacon and eggs? You can here. Amazing, and the price, though a bit scary, is actually good value.
5
Service was good. Had a big slice of complementary birthday cake. Full of smiles. Food is good. Good price for excellent food
5
This is definately the restaurant to bookmark for a buffet lover and make sure to dine in with an empty stomach.They have wide variety of food with 7 open kitchen where food is prepared in a minute and huge dessert section.Not just about the food itself but a very nice ambience ,friendly staff , outstanding service. Overall i enjoyed my dinner. I am thinking of returning for lunch or brunch at the poolside.
5
Straight from an Sq flight arriving 1120am, we had just enough time to grab a buffet lunch @ Edge, Pan Pacific Orchard. We were seated in a great table just where the roast duck were piled neatly and also where you can get a great bowl of laksa. After doing a customary walk once over and familiarizing myself with the different live stations on offer, my first section was where the lobsters on ice and salmon sashimi for starters. Right then and there, I knew already that the Edge was a top notch buffet restaurant even though we were there only during the lunch offer. Edge specializes on the local cuisine, very good satays on skewers that consisted of lamb chicken and beef, in all honesty it was really good. I had a platter from the roasting section, skipping the soy sauce chicken and opting for the leg and thigh parts of the roast duck. There was atleast 4 more live stations on offer that I gave a pass, opting for the dessert station that also had a great selection. I was definitely happy with the lady that waited on our table, on a busy Friday lunch it was a place that satisfied my cravings for eating local dishes in the ambience of a great 5 Star luxury hotel
5
At $180 it seems a bit excessive at first for a buffet - but it's 5 star dining for sure! From lobster to wagu steaks to cheese boards it has everything and for 4 hours this includes free flow top quality champagne this place is well worth the expense, you'll love it - it's excellent!
5
Well the food is not worth mentioning much as since is an "Atas" buffet, it live up to its expectations. What really impressed me and make my dining more enjoyable would be the service staff like Cris, Layla, Sherlyn and the rest. They are attentive, friendly and making my family feel so comfortable. This is my reason to revisit there again.
5
Justin, our waiter, was immaculate in service. Always at hand to cater to our requests, with a warm smile, and delivering promptly with grace. The spread of cuisine was divine, especially the seafood, snow crabs and sashimi, exceptionally fresh and rich with flavour; the grilled meat and roast beef was textured and quite memorable on the palate. The dessert and pastry and ice cream were delightful, even offering Peranakan options. Overall, an ideal night as we sat by the window, overlooking the F1 race track, the roar of the speed demons matching the atmosphere in the restaurant. :
4
This place offers a wide range of food. Quality is not that fantastic though but value for money. Lunch price is about $50++ so check out those credit card promotions. There is the usual prawns and mussels for seafood lovers. Don't think they serve oysters for lunch. Dessert lovers.. you will be in paradise. There is a vast range of dessert to choose from. You can also find exquisite chocolates, local nonya kueh, durian paste and many more. There is a huge chocolate fondue so do look out for it.
5
The Edge has a wide selection that has something for everyone. The variety of fresh Seafood to cooked dishes and desserts are just astonishing.
4
Wide selection of buffet breakfast.
However, there is no Halal logo placed at each station. This would assist Muslim diners to choose the right food.
I have seen Halal logo placed at other neighbouring restaurants.
5
The buffet spread had wide variety and quality of food was great! Service was also excellent. Highly recommended.
3
A good Sunday Brunch at Edge, a vast selection of different foods, cocktails and deserts. When it gets busy the service may leave you a little frustrated. A good place to go if to are looking for something for everyone and a good glass of Champagne. Make sure you book and ask for a good table. enjoy
4
We came here to celebrate a birthday occasion. The restaurant gave us a complimentary one slice of cake at the end of the dinner. They also fulfilled my request to sit near window during my reservation. I got a nice view of Singapore Flyer. The food was great with a lot of choices especially the seafood section. There are fresh oyster, Alaska crab and scallop. You must try sambal crayfish. Dessert section is superb and must try their durian pengat. You must try their ice cream as well especially the chocolate chip.  Overall the dining experience was great and highly recommended to everyone. It is definitely worth trying and price was reasonable. One of the best dinner buffets that I've ever had.
4
I have been Edge for more than 10 times and this is the best ever! Thank you so much for Justin to make our dinner very enjoyable. He is very attentive and friendly, never miss our order! Our group is a big group (13 people) but he didn't mix up our drink!Justin is a very hard working person, always walking back and forth to clean up our plates!Being a frequent customer, this is the service i am looking for!Thank you Justin
5
We went to this restaurant only for breakfast, which was included in our room package. Offers a lavish buffet of at least five major cuisines: Western, Chinese, Malay, Indian, Japanese. Well prepared, interesting food. Only the coffee (both brewed and barista) wasn't all that great. Tip: This restaurant is really popular on Sundays, and even though the hotel uses a second restaurant for brunch, Edge gets really crowded. Get there as early as possible, and definitely before 9am, if you don't want to wait in a queue
5
Wonderful time celebrating a special occasion with my girlfriend. Food variety and quality is above average. Special thanks to Layla for the cake and immaculate timing of bringing it without prompt. Also a shout out to Kok Chia for his excellent service! Would recommend this place anytime. Keep it up guys!The only comment I have is I wish the plates were heated to keep the hot food hot. Most of the time the food got cold while eating other food
5
Food selection was great. Kudos to the Chefs for doing a great job. Service staff, Justin attended to us throughout the evening. Very attentive and patient although restaurant was full. He even went the extra mile by offering to order a mooncake from Hai Tien Lo and had it delivered to our table. An asset to the organization.
3
Edge has a great choice of food, ranging from large variety of seafood - to meat and poultry, to deserts. Quality is good (but not amazing); most of the fish and seafood has probably been frozen since it doesn't have the classical fresh taste. The bill is however pretty steep (USD100+ pp), in particular if you elect to get some wine/beer/spirits which are also priced pretty steep (USD 12-15 for small beer
5
We recently went Edge for dinner. We were greeted by the wide variety of food selection! Sashimi and seafood were all fresh, service was prompt and food were all fantastic! We would come back again for more!
5
Dined in with some friends for dinner. Spread was huge and quality was excellent. Unfortunately could not try everything as my stomach was too small. Would definitely recommend this place to other people.
4
Restaurant within Pan Pacific.
Sunday Brunch: Blowout champagne meal buffet style.
Some real treats amongst the usual fare: seafood ceviche, Alaskan king crab, pan seared foie gras...
Gets a bit hectic a peak time and some of the obvious stuff gets hoovered up.
4
With numerous competing buffet meals in singapore you are spoilt for choice.
You won't be disappointed with EDge.food variety fantastic seafood galore andcusines covered is totallynglobal
Very good value for money'. as it's part of pan pacific it has style and is chic.
5
We recently enjoyed the Wednesday night buffet with free flow drinks. The food and wines were very good and the staff were wonderful.
5
Wide food selections .
Would like to compliment Justin for being very helpful during our dining experience .
Service undoubtedly world class and would highly recommend anyone to dine here .
4
Food variety is good and restaurant ambience is cosy and comfortable. What my friends and I liked : 1) sashimi counter where the chef cut the fresh salmon upon your orders. This is great as most other restaurants pre-cut the sashimi and leave them in the open; 2) the satays were tasty though could see they were deep fried before being BBQ-ed. Guess they have to do this to keep up with the demand; 3) indian food was nice especially the chicken tikka and mutton curry 4) fresh pizzas were excellent 5) desserts spread was good and we especially liked the ice creams and the durain dessert. What was disappointing to us were the crayfish (tasteless) and clams .. oysters would be nice but perhaps only offered during buffet dinner (higher price).Overall, still a good experience. Will try to the buffet dinner and Sunday champagne brunch next time
3
Family and I visited this place to check on the lunch buffet on a weekend. The place was filled with group of diners confirming the fact about the popularity of the place.So much choices of food and quality was good.so much people around but service was fast and food trays were always replenished. Food tastes good and the crowded place eventhough noisy and busy is worth visiting. Price is quite on the high side though
5
We went for Sunday Champagne Brunch at Edge and it was one of the best brunches we have had in Singapore, and there have been many,from the friendly happy staff with their ever prompt refilling of glasses,the relaxed atmosphere,tuneful live band entertainment, to the impressive variety and quality of the food.Diets be dammed here,I am a veggie and I was very happy with the delicious choices available,although next time I may pass on the second helping of truffle mac'n' cheese but it was so delish with the tiny tomatoes and mini rosti,what is a girl to do? There is something here for everyone Chinese,Malay,Indian,Western,Carvery,Japanese,Seafood and Caviar I lost count of the stations plus enough sweet things to make Wiily Wonka jealous! including the most yummy gluten free chocolate brownies.....with ice cream and sprinkles ! then if you have any space left there is a great selection of cheese with different breads,crackers and dried fruit.There are also cocktails available and red or white wine as well as juices.If you would llike something cooked to order you just give them one of the little numbered sticks that are in the box on your table and they bring it to you when it is ready,so no standing around waiting.The Indian station was excellent,good choice of dishes and lots of nans,pickles and poppadums.My husband was delighted with the caviar bar,the duck pancakes and char siew pork.Truthfully we ate and drank far too much really enjoyed it and would encourage you to go and try it for yourself.This is definitely something to do if you live here or are paying a visit, it may be a little pricey but it is so worth it
5
The atmosphere was good, food selection and quality were great, including expensive stuff like wagyu and king crabs. The service staff were friendly and top notch (e.g. Justin who served our table) and even gave an extra birthday cake for us without my family request. Went the extra-mile. Will definitely return in future
5
Excellent food and friendly staff. we loved Big & Milky Oysters and everything in the buffet. Thanks to waiter Justine for excellent customer service.
5
Excellent food and friendly staff here at Edge Pan Pacific Hotel in SG. Good place to celebrate any ocassions with personalized cakes for celebrant. Special thanks to Asst Manager Sherlyn, Surish and wonderful service of server Justine. 👍🍇🍒🌯🍿🍲🍣🍦🎂👍
5
They offer all the breakfast foods and dishes imaginable. Great food with very nice and friendly staff. If you're staying at Pan Pacific, this is your place to go.
5
Personalised cake for a bday celebration by waiter Justin. Friendly and attentive staff who tends to your needs. Accedes to guests requests. Lovely ambience.
Wide selection and quality fresh seafood.
5
Having lived in Singapore over 10 years we have been to our share of buffets. Pan Pacific Edge is our family favorite. Yet again a huge selection for the whole family. Delectable Asian dishes, meats, antipasto, seafood and the desserts are amazing. Another fantastic meal!
5
I was very impressed by the quality of the food and the service. It is a good place to dine with friends who are from oversea, there is not only serving all the fresh seafood but authentic local delight.Plus, all the staff over there are very friendly and helpful, esp, Janice! she is very attentive and hospitable that my friends and I have a fantastic dinner at the Edge,Btw Must try the Durian Mousse after your meal. Wow, It's super ! You will come back for that if you are a big fan of durian
4
I've been to different buffet in Singapore.i must say that Edge got unique variety. From indian food, local delights (chilli crab, laksa, chicken rice & roasted pork) , Japanese food the best (sushi is pretty awesome ), the pizza was superb( worth the carbs)... The grill & pasta station pretty decent... they have roasted Lamb ... the fruit drinks are average... The seafood station is same as the other buffet . they have Oyster, snow crab, clam, mussels & scallops...sad no lobsters. Anyway, there are other food to compensate. the desert station is decent range but not a lot. i love the green tea cheesecakes!
3
We had Sunday champagne brunch in a group of 5. The restaurant has a large selection of food - seafood, peking duck, suckling pig, steaks, pasta, Indian, cold cuts, burrata, etc. We really could not get around and sample all the offerings in 4 hours!! They also serve wines and have a champagne cocktail station and a mojito station. The wait staff were very attentive and we never had to ask for a champagne top up.The downside is that this is not a decadent brunch that leaves you feeling pampered and slightly smug. The quality of food and the flavours are not top notch and it’s a very casual brunch, people don’t get dressed up (which to me is kind of the point of having champagne brunch). First world problems, and I admit that we are slightly snobbish where it comes to champagne brunches.We paid about SGD$210 per person and wouldn’t return here for champagne brunch again. If you do go, ask for a table close to the windows – we were seated towards the middle of the restaurant and it felt a little dreary without the natural light
4
Champagne brunch at the Pan Pacific. The brunch starts theatrically in their 'Edge' restaurant at 12:00 noon with a row of waiters letting the corks of Veuve Clicquot champagne 'pop'. Lasting until 4:00 pm, they say this is the longest brunch in Singapore with unlimited champagne, wine, beer and cocktails.The buffet, has 16 stations and includes Alaskan Snow crab, oysters, caviar bar, prawns, Peking duck, dumplings, foils gras, sushi and sashimi, Tatar of wagyu beef or salmon, cervico, array of tandoori and satay, suckling pig and a whole baby lamb, roast beef, terrines, prosciutto, cold cuts, more desserts than you can images and a cheese buffet to dream of.Most dishes are available at the buffet, a few dishes however such as home made ravioli, foes gras and meats from the grill, are cooked to order and served at your table. The service was attentive and friendly.The quality of the food was generally good, but there are always some trade offs with a buffet; vast selection of exquisite produce, but once some of it stays too long on the buffet, or some of the seafood was frozen, I guess that is the other side of the deal. We had to ask for a finger bowl, which with such a selection of various crabs should have been a given.Overall not cheap at S$200 per person, but given the unlimited champagne und huge selection of generally very nice dishes, we had enjoyed our brunch and were satisfied by the time we left the Pan Pacific around 4:00pm
5
Coming from a very long and tiring travel, we didn't expect to be tempted to eat very much for a dinner but when we saw this restaurant in the comfort of our hotel, we decided we wanted to eat. There were at least 3 stations were they cook, grill and prepare the food for you but the ready to eat dishes were also cooked to perfection. Although the alcoholic drinks were not included in the package, we nevertheless indulged ourselves. I enjoyed my white wine especially partnered with the fresh big oysters, my absolute favorite of the night. We had a fantastic night at one of the best buffet restaurants we've ever been to.
4
A great buffet with a lot of variety. The staff were friendly and courteous. We had a great time exploring the various food options available.
Desserts especially were amazing..
5
I had the Brunch buffet recently while holidaying in Singapore and it was an incredible experience. Managed to eat dishes I've never tried before like foie gras and wagyu beef. The choices were endless. A fantastic spread of food. Highly recommended.
5
Had a dinner last July 22, 2016, and its our first time in Edge. There's a wide spread range of food! I love the Alaskan crabs and oysters. Don't forget the crayfish and the steak. Will definitely recommend this place!
4
Having a biz lunch at Edge, the atmosphere is cool and the food is variety. Plus, nice and passion staff serving by Ms Ivy Tan.
4
So much selection! We can't even eat everything! Great service! Ivy was servicing our table & she is super attentive. Our champagne glasses were never empty.
4
They served very wide spread of buffet. All the foods was very good specially their steak, but one of their food gave me trauma. Tried one of the dishes, came with sticky/gelish cold ham. Tasted weird but still forced myself to ate it, and ended up I got food poison for next 2 days, but too lazy to pursue this matters, since I was unsure that time which food that gave me stomach upset. Because I went there and booked for 40 pax, I was the only one that got food poison. But apparently I was the only one that tried that dish also, since it wasn't look appealing and nobody bothered to tried. But well, we came during National Day SG 50, and got very good deal (50% off). I will come back again one day, but this time I will make sure not to eat raw food and ham.
4
Free-flow Veuve for 3.5 hours is amazing, especially in Singapore. They even have a cocktail station - what a deal! (In spite of the brunch running until 4, 3:30 is last pour for drinks. But you can have a couple stocked up. )Frankie - if you get him as your waiter, you're very lucky! He was so attentive and went over and beyond. What a legend! Actually, everyone (except the rude younger guy cooking the made-to-order steaks) provided exceptional service - thank you! The food was amazing, and I'd love to go back. Sadly, I can't give them 5-stars for serving foie gras.
4
The range and quality of food was impressive, with Italian, Spanish, Indian, Peranakan, local, Japanese, seafood including Alaskan king crab, dessert, coffee and tea. The durian dessert was very nice.The ambience of the renovated Pan Pacific was very good.However the reservation got the surname of my friend who booked wrong. They should learn to read back as the staff was clearly Filipino. She kept telling many of us there was no reservation until I asked to check by phone number.Additionally the staff had difficulty with English spelling, messing up "Best Whises" on a cake for my colleague whom we were hosting the dinner for.The restaurant should spend more effort on staff training
5
If you want a spectacular food experience - this is it!!I tried foods I would never normally try, and some of my favourite foods were taken to the next level in this phenomenal dining experience!The live band added to the whole atmosphere, and it was truly an amazing brunch.We allowed a whole hour of our 4 hour dining for dessert - and it was so worth it!!Can't wait to go again when I'm next in Singapore
5
it was a farewell gathering for our beloved friend Julie (back to UK) and we had a magnificent brunch with all varieties western food plus local dishes (love the indian food) and non-stop veuve clicquot champagne, beers, mojito and champagne cocktails like mimosa, kir royale, etc.. seafood was the fresh and yummy! what makes us memorable was the kindness of peter and never ending smile even though we ask for so much request and the last minute request to fill-up high our glasses for champagne as he informed us all final bottle for us, he was a remarkable hotel staff and friendly. kudos the the barman name magen and all the chef, an indian man who always serve our ordered food.. EDGE is one of The Best of The Best champagne brunch we had.Great Food! Great Service! Value for Money
5
Visited the buffet for dinner. great food and atmosphere. wait staff was very attentive. especially Jega. Kudos for such a nice place to relax and take in a meal.
5
was here with a large group of friends . it was like an adventure .. such freat variety couldnt finish trying all was already full by then ..a must go !!
5
Great variety . The services is great . Justin provides good and timely service . Value for money .
Would be better if fruits juice can come free
3
One of our favorite dining place that offers a wide variety of food. Desserts selection is appealing and yummy too.The only improvement would be on the baked chessy clayfish at the live station. Restaurant could better manage customers' expectation should there be a limit to the number of crayfish a customer is entitled too.
4
The food offered great variety and quality. I especially liked the food cooked to order which was great. I had Justin serving my table, his service was very attentive and he gave great suggestions of food to try. The buffet was very reasonably priced for what you get.
4
I'd have to say my experience here was amazing. Great food, great concept, extensive desert selection and lastly and most importantly, top notch service. One particular server, Justin was very prompt, alert and personal. There is however room for improvement on the ambience, lighting was quite dim and white noise was alightly less than satisfactory. Overall great place to dine so give them a try
5
One of the best services received in hotels! Had seafood night dinner with my family last Thursday and Justin has been a wonderful assistance to us as he recommended us the Curry Fish Head and even took the time to explain to us the parts of the fish which had more taste or meat to suit to our liking. This chap deserves a promotion for his effort and enthusiasm at work.Will definitely be back again and recommend this place to our family and friends
4
Visited this place for dinner with my wife. Honestly, the variety of food on offer is commendable but I would just like to point out that the sashimi is not really fresh and the cutting slicing of the sashimi is not satisfactory. I understand that there's some skills in cutting the fishes. But my sashimi ended up very chewy with lots of "vein" in the swordfish especially. And the worse thing is that they did not taste fresh as well.However, with that being said, the rest of the food are more than satisfactory. And that was matched with the same quality of services rendered by the servers!The desserts run out pretty fast and I missed out on some the more popular ones
5
I chose Edge @ Pan Pacific Hotel to celebrate my wife's birthday after viewing lots of great reviews in the net. I decided to reserve a table near to the window to celebrate her birthday on a weekday. And Yes they have secured one of the best view for us! (Viewing across Singapore Flyer) Moreover my wife loves seafood especially Crabs!!! No doubt, the review speak! And we had a wonderful & fabulous buffet dinner there!Food: I could say One of the Best International Buffet in Singapore! Covering a huge range of selections / variety; Chinese, Japanese, Indian, local, etcThey have individual (solo) stations including desert, seafoods, sushi, grill, local delights, drinks etc. Foods are replenished quickly once it's running low.What we can't missed out are their range of Seafood!!! Fresh & different kinds of Crabs! My wife enjoyed so much and filled ourselves with those delicious seafood! *Highly recommended for Seafood Lovers!Customer Service: All their staffs put on a smile as they met us. Especially the service crew named Ms "Haley" served our table (who I believed to serve the allocated tables around us). In spite of all the tables are occupied around us, Ms Haley managed to clear all our dirty plates & glasses are pronely removed. She always smile whenever we requested assistance. *Thumbs up for her*Ambience: Overall it's a cosy and peaceful, a great place for couples, celebration, business discussion and even family gathering!Price: I would say it's a fairly Good Deal with the variety and amount of foods on the serving stations. And of course all of which are Delicious!! There's nothing more we can ask for!Thanks for all the delicious food and hospitality from Edge! You have craved a memorable day for me and my wife on her birthday

Had lunch buffet with family on 25 June 2016. There's quite a variety of food selection, however, taste of food was below my expectation. Disappointed with the service as it took quite a long time to have our used plates cleared away from our table. Difficult to locate staff to refill our drinks as well
5
Vast variety of food. Succulent food and desserts. Nice ambience. Excellent service provided by service staff Justin.
5
Enjoyed the good food and service, especially with the waiter Justin, who is always serving us with a smile and is quick in clearing the dishes.
4
The variety of food in the buffet was excellent and so is the ambiance. We had breakfast there and it was great with Japanese, British, South Indian and Chinese cuisines, and much more.
The fresh juice counter was great, i had my favorite carrot juice.
5
I just had my birthday celebration on the evening of 26 June and my family, relatives and I were very impressed by the service of the Edge buffet restaurant of Pan Pacific Hotel (3rd floor). The waiter, Justin, was very attentive in picking up the used plates from our tables and offering to serve tea when we were eating desserts. In addition, when we requested to clear the tables for cake cutting, he ushered us to a clean table for us to do that. He also took initiatives in taking photos and suggesting a great backdrop for us of the Singapore Flyer. Overall, it was a delicious dinner made memorable by the great service! Thank you :)
5
Undoubtedly the best buffet in singapore . No matter how many buffets we have tried we always come back to the edge when we want something special.So far you have never failed to please us .Had the best chillie crab and sambal cray fish today . In addition I'm so thankful that you serve gluten free bread and desserts which i have never seen at any other buffet . The staff are friendly and prompt . Overall superb experience every single time

Had the seafood night/dinner at Edge earlier on. While the replenishment of the seafood bar was very slow, the other aspects made up for it. It's a little weird to be there for the seafood special night but having to wait for the replenishment of the oysters etc, time and time again. Even other guests were waiting around for it as well. Nevertheless, it is something that can be definitely improved on. :) The salmon sashimi was nicely cut, and was fresh to bits. The oysters were big, juicy and succulent! The desserts section was a little disappointing, felt like they could have done more than just the basic puffs and cookies. However, was pleasantly taken aback by how the matcha nama chocolate tasted. It's so good! The melt in your mouth kind of creamy goodness. The icecream counter was amazing as well! Would recommend Fig&Honey. I was served by Justin - I must say he is an asset to not just the team at Edge, but Pan Pacific Hotel as well. The service provided by him was top notch. He was patient in explaining the little details, highly accommodating, very efficient & was always all smiles. Having studied in the hospitality industry, I understand what makes a professional stand out best. Justin clearly displayed all of the qualities a genuine, passionate service representative should have. He deserves the recognition! Probably the man of Edge in my opinion. Job well done, Justin! Thank you for making me and my bf's night. :)

Apart from what others reviewers have written and complimented Edge, i just want to add that Edge gives you an experience where others will find it hard to match. A lot of times, restaurants which are able to offer good foods normally come with bad service, but this is not the case at Edge. May be we were lucky to have been served by Justin (the waiter) who not only always serve with a smile, but he really makes us feel like the VIPs of the restaurant. Justin practices what i called service from the heart. He offers all the needy such as clearing your plates, topping up your water, scissors, lemon water, ...etc before you even ask for them. I think we were privileged to have Justin serving us who really make our dinning at Edge a very memorable one besides the wide variety of good culinary foods which many reviewers have already written about it

Edge has recently topped the buffet list and we took the chance to celebrate Father's Day there. The food spread was pretty good. Especially love the Alaska crabs which was awesomely sweet. The ambience was good and the service was the best of all! Special shoutout to Justin who was always wearing a big smile. He is very attentive and the service rendered was beyond words. Thank you for making our dinner such an enjoyable one

Had a gathering with friends on a fathers' day weekend on 18 June. It was a first visit for all of us. We have heard about alot of great reviews but finally got to witness on this dinner. Welcome by a lot of large variety of great yummies and superb service. The variety of food was really quite a bit that I think it was not possible to try all. Specially like the korean station, local station, satays, zi cha & fresh sashimi. There was even Klang Bak Kut Teh! I was more surprised by the quality of service with patience, prompt response and consistent follow up of our many requests as our group consists of children and it was a very busy Fathers' day weekend for the restaurant. Maybe the only suggestions is to add on Yakult for guests' good digestion like some other otherseas hotels. :)Specially thanks to Mr. Justin who took time to explain everything we asked and took really great great to ensure our happy feasting. Definately we or I will return soon for more feasts with good foood & excellent service
5
It was a wonderful dining experience at The Edge. Dinner service was great, as always. A word of praise must go to your staff, Justin, for his impeccable service. It makes all the difference. We definitely look forward to returning in future. Thank you for the lovely evening.

Absolutely one of the widest variety of food covering Singapore local - Chilli crab, Bak Kut teh, crayfish; Japanese sashimi and sushi counter, Korea food, fresh prawns , oysters etc and fantastic dessert section. Great service. Love it!
5
Excellent food with exceptional service staff! Especially "Justin", who has been very patient , and ensure our plates are cleared regularly and drinks are refilled. He took the time to create mini conversation, good personalising! Definitely an asset to this company!
5
My first visit to the edge Lots of variety from appetizer to cooked food to dessert are excellentValue for moneyService is excellentMy friend book 1 month in advance and we did enquire for vegetarianThe service staff actually remember that we have a vegetarian among us ( so attentive and good memory)The service crew are attentive and clear our plates frequently They are patient and willingly to help us esp we have two children among usHighly commendable service crew JustinHighly recommended buffe
5

I have enjoyed several great Sunday brunches around Singapore. The Edge is one of the better ones especially for seafood and variety. The seafood is fresh and plenty. The Alaskan crab legs were fresh, sweet and plentyful. Great with their house made seafood sauce. The brunch includes a whole bbq lamb and pig. Also good Indian and regional local dishes are presented. The wagu steak cooked to order was great. The desert selection and variety of cheeses was fantastic. I greatly enjoyed the Japanese sweets. I always over endulge and need a long walk to help digest the great food. This visit we spent 3hrs enjoying the meal. If you are in the Marina Bay area on a Sunday try this extensive and tastie brunch
5
We dine at Edge for our 3rd year wedding anniversary and I would say it is the best buffet restaurant in term of service and quality of food. I have encountered so far. And our waiter in the area, Justin, was attentive and polite. He really made us feel at home while dining there
5
This is a very good place to eat, there is lots of food to choose from the buffet, especially seafood, and you should definitely choose to have the unlimited wine option! Our server Justin was most attentive and provided us with an excellent service! Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone coming to Singapore
5
My family and I really had a great time together celebrating my daughters 1st yr. The spread was really wide, food was excellent and the service for freshly cook food like grills, seafood was also quite fast esp for a Saturday night dinner. There were the popular ones like oysters , prawns, bimbimbab etc were replenish also very timely. Quality of food was above all our expectations. Most importantly, the service staff, they were constantly wearing smiles all the time even on a busy night with many requests here and there. Our service staff Jega really well-represented Panpacific in many areas of service. His attitude towards servicing us is excellent, spontaneous and very detailed in his work, never over promise but deliver his best and made my family's night a memorable one. Thank you Guys and keep up the good work and world class standard
5
Celebrated my partner's birthday with his family at the Edge. Food selection at the Edge was great, with quality seafood in a variety of cooking styles. More importantly, the service was superb. Our waiter Frankie was very friendly and introduced us to many of the food options at the buffet. Dirty plates was cleared promptly. They even gave a complimentary birthday cake for my partner, which was delicious. Would come back again
5
Service staff, Frankie n Lawrence, are very thoughtful n friendly. Always ensuring I have a clean table for the next plate. Food selection is great. The dessert is heavenly. Ambience is wonderful for get together with friends. It's my second time here but I wouldn't mind coming back again n again as I do notice a change in the food variety thumbs up
4
went for weekend buffet lunch and the staff greet with friendly smile.the buffet spread is more than what you have for a buffet with seven stations consist of chinese , indian.western and japanese cuisine.Generally, is a huge variety of food with a decent price worth coming back.(been here many times)would like to thank Charmaine for her excellent service and patience
5
That was a great buffet dinner enjoyed at edge , the food was a lot of variety , the most I like is was green tea chocolate dessert . One thing I have to compliment is the service especially service from Frankie even the restaurant was very busy he able to show his professional , efficient service and smiling face , He facing to all the guest able to provide the same service not even our table . For sure i will be back with my friend and family 
5
we had a dinner with my family and our jaw drop due to huge selection of food on average price, the chef was very helpful, staff brief us on their food selection and it was our first visit and definitely we will keep on coming back. we were address on our name which i am proud for remembering my name. the t-bone steak was included on their grill items, waffles requested to make new and the chef without any hesitation obliged on our request, we are delighted and so the service of peter, the cashier was very friendly (i'm not sure if she is chinese or korean), the malay girl was very attentive to our request (sorry i can't remember her name) and the rest of the chef.
5
Been here for many times and it has always been my favorite buffet place. Would like to drop a comment here this time. I made a reservation to celebrate my friend's birthday yesterday night. We were seated at the back end which i felt i wasn't comfortable with. We were then greeted by Justin who would be attending to us. I'm very impressed and pleased with the quality of service provided by Justin. He's very friendly & approachable. I would like to highlight that he's very attentive to our needs. It was the most wonderful experience compared to my past visits. Such a commendable service is rare & you have a gem here! Thumbs Up!
5
We were guests in the Pan Pacific hotel - and had both breakfast and a buffet dinner at Edge. Amazing choice for both meals- omelette station, bakery, juice station and barista coffee, and at night roasts/pizza/Indian/Chinese/Japanese/fresh seafood and more. Great dessert bar with ice creams and sorbets too. Excellent service- top shelf.
4
A place to go if you want to have some hearty chats and laughters with friends.They have a wide selection of food, and do try the samba cheese crayfish and durian pengat. On the flip side, I encourage the restaurant to keep their food a little warmer (eg satay, bibimbap, pork ribs)Special thanks to their staff, Justin. Made us feel very comfortable, attentive to our needs, and recommended some of their specialities to us
5
Buffet spread: Seafood,Japnese,Italian, Indian,Korean, Roasted and not to forget awesome dessert options. Enjoy such mouthwatering varieties to choose from Buffetis enjoying with family.First time such varieties of food spread experience with family was simply great. It's money well spent. Very efficient service was added bonus
5
we had dinner with a family friend last week and they were all enjoyed their dinner though it was their first time to experience such wide variety of buffet selection, the restaurant staff Peter give a brief orientation about the dishes and new korean dishes included on that night. They love the stir-fry veg with clams, satay, sushi selection and dessert were all love by their kids. However, the parents of my friend was struggling on the alaskan crab and the staff name Peter was so helpful by giving them pair of scissors and later part, a bowl with water & lemon to wash their hand, all the chef were very helpful and cheer while serving the food though it was busy night. Peter was the same waiter to attended our table from previous visit and we are extremely grateful having his service to our table.More power to Edge and extend our humble thank you Peter and all the chef
4
Good food but service along the food counters are poor. The service crew were more interested to talk about themselves than serving the customers.However the front line mature staff were good and professional.Went twice in a week. Bt i thk need to wait a while more before going again.Second trip- sashimi chef not professional in slicing.
5
My second time here for dinner. Wed/thur are seafood nights. Food were as good as usual. Variety were plenty. Was served by Mr Kandiban who diligently introduced the food. Was not pushy at all. Can feel this guy loves his job. It was a nice experience
5
With 7 different cook stations plus the other selections you are completely spoilt for choice. Attentive staff (Stella, Justin and Janice to name just 3). The opportunity to try different foods is made so easy. The menus are changed daily. Breakfast is amazing too.
4
A good spread of high quality food served in a lovely decorated and cosy ambience. The staff are friendly and responsive which contributed to a satisfactory dining experience. It's also value for money too!
5
Dined with a family group who have eaten a buffet or two in their time. All agreed great selection and very good quality all round. Give it a spin... and take your time :)
4
We went for the international buffet and we were spoilt with choices of food. Seafoods are fresh and great! The environment is relaxing and it is just facing the Singapore Flyer. The service is good despite slower sometimes. Overall, a good experience dining here
4
We were there for family dinner. Their food cover varies varieties: Sushi, Nasi Brayani, desert, fruits, roasted chicken, lamb, beef, pork, sausage, Chinese style cooking, seafood, western style, salad, nyonya style etc.Overall taste are above average.Could be better if they encourage customer to leave feedback by stall.

My family and I dine-in at Edge on 12th Mar 2016. I made an online reservation more than a month ago requesting for window seating with good view to celebrate mine and my son's 21st birthday. I personally called up twice to confirm the reservation and was being assured a good seating was being arranged. To my disappointment, upon arrival we were being given a 4 seater sofa seat far from the window with an additional 5th chair facing the crowds coming into the restaurant. Not to mention any view but with such awkward seating position it had immediately spoiled my appetite. There were no birthday wishes from any of the staff not even a piece of cake to acknowledge our birthday. While everyone else was given a complimentary cake for the birthday occasion we have none. I end up buying a cake from nearby Conrad Hotel otherwise we have no cake to celebrate. As for food wise some of the seafood were not fresh especially crayfish and the beef taste bad.Despite sending in feedbacks, what I received were a bunch of excuses. My comments and remarks were being ignored. It was totally a waste of time talking to the Manager! Well, if you do not value our business you do not deserve a good comment & review
5
A most memorable experience for my daughter's 21st birthday. We had a group of 50 pax and everyone just enjoyed eating ... eating... eating.. with the best company of relatives and friends what more to ask for??The choice of food was awesome. My relatives and friends enjoyed themselves . Most importantly what stood out most was the service from the Staff -Thanks to Suresh and especially to these wonderful team -Reynan , Shah, Frankie , Helen and Sherlyn who went extra mile to ensure that all guests were taken care . Keep up the GOOD work , the beautiful smile on each staff face and the sincere gesture that was much appreciated by all of us present- would definitely come back again:

I'm not a buffet fan, mostly because I have no self-restraint and I tend to overindulge. So when I was recently staying at Pan Pacfic I decided to have breakfast from the al la carte menu, showing great restraint on my part. I ordered the bircher muesli - $10, this was really nice, served with fresh fruit - one of the best bircher muesli's I've had - and I consider myself a bircher muesli aficionado. My complaint is that a small glass of orange juice and a supposed "latte" consisting mostly of foam cost $12 each. I paid $10 for breakfast and $24 for a juice and a coffee. Ultimately I paid $40 (incl taxes, service charges etc), which is the cost of the buffet breakfast! Charging me $20 for the muesli and $7 for the juice and coffee would make me feel less foolish
5
I love the food there but what stood out was the service from their employees. I went for the HOOKED buffet dinner and I must say that the seafood spread was extensive with lots of live stations. What WOW me was the different variety of desserts but most importantly, the Durian Puree is to die for! Would definitely come back again
4
Located within the Pan Pacific 'Edge' offers a vast international smorgasbord with western, Asian and Indian kitchens. The food choices are almost endless, from lobster and great seafood, to steaks and salads - and of course and extraordinary dessert section.The real highlight here is the service, friendly, very efficient and not the least pretentious - around $160 per couple
5
Been here twice for lunch buffet. The food are very fresh and nice. A lot of varieties.
I like the desserts the most. Must free up your stomach for the soft rum chocolates!
4
Buffet at the hotel is good. Staff must be more attentive. But food taste is very nice. more food for kids can be appreciate.
4
Had our reunion lunch here, always spoilt for choices here with lotsa of variety Remember to leave room for desserts...
5
Came here to celebrate the start of 2016 with a bang! Great food, great service and even better free flow champagne and cocktails! highly recommend! one of the best champagne brunches i have been to in Singapore!
5
Came here for Sunday lunch with my family and we were immensely impressed. The staff, food and ambience were all fantastic and we can't wait to come back!
4
We went for the buffet lunch on a weekday . The place was huge and it was not crowded. We made reservation and were given a nice couch seat near the Japanese food segment. There was a very wide spread of delicious food. The sections are Japanese, Indian, Cold Seafood , Peranakan , Local, Italian, Western, Sandwich , Salad and Dessert. It is worth mentioning that the dessert section was impressive. Good - Fresh salmon sashimi - 4 types of delicious Peranakan chilli - Parma ham pizza and smoked salmon pizza- The dark chocolate and green tea chocolate truffles - The durian pengat- The classy ambience - The attentive service - 10% discount was given for some credit cards Bad - Only tea and coffee are served. There is no selection of cappuccino , lattee and etc- Only syrup cordial was served. There was no fruit juices. - Fresh oysters are not available during the lunch buffet . I was told that fresh oysters are available for dinner. As a lover for fresh oysters, not offering it for the lunch buffet is a slight disappointment. The Line Restaurant offered fresh oysters for their lunch buffet and I believe that it is still the same. I only paid $50 including taxes but after the 10% credit card discount . I feel that it is very good for money. The spread was so wide that I could not possibly try everything . So , not having oysters was alright . However, I will not give it a 100% satisfactory experience due to the three 'bad' points as mentioned above. If they improve on these three points, I would say that they are one of the best buffet lunches in town.
5
Sometimes buffets can be disappointing when it comes to quality of food. But Edge certainly is not one of those places. The range of high quality food is mind boggling. And it s of the highest quality. The head Chef goes round the tables to Ensure that everyone is happy! He clearly takes pride in the food served. Highly recommended!
5
We ate here as our first choice restaurant was full. Their loss was our gain. We were very professionally welcomed to the restaurant and my name was written on a plate that was displayed on the table. The crew explained the process to us and talked us through the evening. This is a very extensive international buffet that offered dishes from Singapore, Malaysia, India, China, Japan and Thailand. We were there on a Thursday evening when the emphasis is on seafood. They even had prawn satay which can be quite difficult to find. There was a very fresh display of crab, lobster, oysters, prawns, salmon and white fish that will be cooked for your order. An innovation was that you had a wooden stick with your table number and when the chef had prepared your dish it will be delivered directly to your table. The restaurant, or Food Theatre as it describes itself, offers free flow orange or Lemon Barley drink as well as tea and coffee. We enjoyed a bottle of Shiraz that was sensible priced. The deserts could be a little more adventurous but that is a very minor quibble. We all agreed that we had a great evening and that it represented good value
5
Been to this restaurant a few times and its amazing!!! There is a massive range of different food with different sections. The food is cooked to perfection and the seafood is fresh. The staff is helpful and the dessert is some of the best I have had. Will definitely over indulge as everything is so delicious. Definitely worth the visit.
4
It was my first time dining at Edge for dinner. One of the best buffet spreads around, and value for money! Service was great, service staff were very efficient. It's very spacious as compared to most of the buffet restaurants around. They have so many varieties that I was already full with only nearly half the spread. Gotta come back for round 2
3
We recently tried the festive dinner buffet. Although the food quality are reasonably good and fresh, the variety of food is lesser than what is offered at other well-known buffets. We were charged $88++ per pax with a 10% discount (via certain credit card payments)...
5
I went to Edge for buffet breakfast (it was complimentary part of Bed and Breakfast package).Staffs are efficient and polite. and foods are varied (from Japanese noodles to pan cake).One thing I don't like is this : pork sausages and chicken sausages are placed side by side. ( Muslims don't like it.
4
Undoubtedly one of the best brunch buffet around town. The ambience is great - roomy and you have plenty of room to manoeuvre without feeling having to fight for your space with other patrons. The few times I was there, I took up their champagne brunch deal and I think it's truly is value of money for the quality of food and the choices they offer. From chinese, indian, malay, straits, spanish, italian, western and japanese - this buffet truly showcase international cuisine at its best
5
Went for Christmas Day buffet lunch with my wife,daughter,son in law and grandson and grandson's "auntie".Lovely warm welcome and seated at table within minutes.The array of food available was unbelievable....presentation first class...and the taste was so special.Your champagne glass was topped up regularly.....beer,cocktails,soft drinks readily available.Service was top drawer.Seriously,one of the best dining experiences any one of us had enjoyed.Just brilliant!
5
Was having the international buffet on a Saturday. Having a good lengthy table for 11 pax facing the Singapore Flyer will definitely add-on to the dinner buffet. The buffet spread was one of the largest variety range I had for hotel buffet , not even starting to mention its on a non-themed buffet night. Service is excellent and the table "sticks" are located in the small drawer of the chopstick holder.Price is definitely worth every single penny for food ranging from Alaska crabs to cheese-melted crayfish etc. Just remember to save a portion of your stomach for desert to sum it up 
5
It was my first time to dine at Edge in Pan Pacific Singapore and I must say that its one of the best! The food was fantastic! From meat, veggies, seafood to desserts, they even have a cheese station, so cool! The sushi was so fresh and yummy! Chef Jeff was terrific and The service team of Suresh and Lawrence was great and accommodating. Really worth your money
4
I have been here couple times, during their theme nights and on weekends. Food spread was great with many choices. For SEAFOOD lovers (me!), there was huge Alaskan crab legs with an abundant of crab meat that I swore would bring anyone to their knees. It was that big that you could put your entire fork through (but don’t try ^.^). The chefs at the grill station took orders at the speed of lightning, and churned out plates of beefs, lamb chops and assorted sausages. At the western corner, I SUPER loved the BBQ pork ribs that tasted like our local char siew albeit tougher. There was also pork knuckles, Edge’s homemade sausages, crispy christmas stuffings, gratin beef lasagne and potato gnocchi that was sinfully cheesy. There were also traditional roasted turkey with giblet sauce, smoked juniper ham with cranberry sauce and smoked chicken with honey. As i dined on Tuesday, the theme of the night was Cuts at Edge. There was a huge roasted whole lamb to satisfy the monsters in our tummies! For desserts, there were Santa Hat Petits Gateaux, Raisin Panettone, English Plum Pudding with Brandied Butterscotch, Stollen, Santa Claus Red Velvet Cupcake, logcake, fruit cake, minced pie, Durian shooters, Chocolate Mousse, assorted Festive Cookies, signature soft chocolates (that reminds me of Royce’s Nama chocolates), waffles and 5 types of ice creams etc! I was so full at the end of the meal I had to roll out..
5
The buffet spread was excellent! you can find from cold seafood, Chinese, Jap, Indian, Western choices. Cheese station was good as well. For festive they have turkey and ham, roast lamb to name a few. Only setback is no oysters, but they did have crayfish. For drinks they only served cordial drinks with coffee/tea. Dessert was superb. You can see how excited am I that I only took dessert bar's pictures. They had varities of nyonya kuehs as well as the cakes, cookies and chocolates. Try the creme brulee, its fantastic! Not halal though
5
A great place to enjoy dinner with friends. Worth the money, the Staff are so welcoming and friendly , the executive chef Mr. Jeffrey Lim is so accomodating and I apologized for not knowing their post in the Restaurant ,Mr. Suresh and Mr. Lawrence makes me and my friends comfortable the whole time. WORTH THE MONEY for gastronomy enthusiast as the food varieties are much.
5
We had the Christmas lunch buffet at Edge @ Pan Pacific Singapore and my oh my, was it jolly good! Not the first time that I've been there but I'm still constantly impressed with the standards of the service staff and also the food selection. The chirashi dons were fantastic - probably the best I've had so far. Turkey, honey-baked ham, roast beef, and the decadence of the desserts would sure tempt any foodie. Must have meal before Christmas! It was also a celebration my family had for my birthday, and also my parents 37 wedding anniversary. Definitely enjoyable for all of us
5
During my stay at the Pan Pacific I dined daily for breakfast and lunch at the Edge restaurant. It is called a food theatre due to the many different stations and foods, there are at least 7 options and all are cooked fresh.
Highly recommended.
5
If you are looking for variety in choice of food this is the right place to go. Lobster, snow crab, oysters that never seem to run out. The service is also excellent.
3
Living in Dubai we were a little disappointed with the choice of food available. The hostess didn't really show us around the various stations. OK but nothing special. Expensive too.
4
Try the steam snow crab, chili crab dish, salmon sashimi and satay, totally palatable! Don't forget the durian puree and other mouth-watering chocolates available.

My mom brought my husband and myself here for a buffet dinner on Tue night, as the restaurant that I wanted to go was fully booked; and my husband could not find the restaurant that he wanted to go to. At first, the waitress did not want to give us the seated sofa area, and told my husband that it is already being reserved. However, after a while, she changed her mind, came to my husband and gave that vacant area to us. For a start, the restaurant area is really too big. I have to walk twice for my first and second servings of food before I could find where we were seated. There is a huge variety of selection in the restaurant. There is satay, soup noodle section. However, most of the foods come in curry, and may not be very suitable for someone who is not a curry person or curry lover. There is also a lot of seafood, which suited my husband's palate, but not mine as I am allergic to seafood; and my mom cannot take them too due to high purine, which will cause her a bout of gout. The rojak that I shared with my husband tasted not too bad. There is also a lot of lamb and turkey being served in the buffet area, due to the upcoming festive season. However, if you are not really such food lover, then they may not be your cup of tea. I also tried the Wagyu beef, which was cut on the spot. It was thinly sliced. However, it seemed to be hard, and still a bit raw, in my opinion. My mom managed to try the cheese, but was put off by the goat cheese. Actually, the indication below that cheese did not really state goat cheese, so it may be a bit misleading. There is a lot of desserts too, though all in almost mini-portions. What beats me is that the ice cream section is not free to take by the patrons, meaning that you need to call the waitress or waiter in that section to help you with the serving. However, I did not see any. Anyway, not too big deal for me, as I am not supposed to take too much cold food, due to that my body constitution is not very good to begin with. We also ordered lemon tea after having our buffet. Seemed that the restaurant is short of staff, as we called for so long, and nobody came to our table. So eventually my husband went to call the waiter over. The price per pax is definitely about same value as that of Shangri-la hotel in Orchard, though in my mom's view, it is not really value for money. Of course, the food selection there is still better than what is being offered in the Pan Pacific Orchard Hotel, near to where we live currently
5
On my husband's birthday, I just had lunch buffet at Edge that first of, amazing and stunning many kinds of international foods and fresh, gluten free bread. And with kind guide on the board, high quality and tasty foods all and I was so satisfied with those...and I would like to say with regard to quite nice employees who prepared birthday cake with beautiful song for my husband. Besides, they kept on taking a care of baby, to be checked to need any help as well. And Korean employee came to us first with kind explanation about what we wanted to know (Thanks Stella ;D).Thanks again for two women and a guy for sing a song together. I hope to see all of guys later and I'll recommend this awesome and attractive Pan Pacific Hotel Edge's service!!!
4
highly recommend their durian pengat, its so delicious one bowl is never enough. (If you dont see it on display, ask the staff) I had 4 lunches there, some of my favourites are : grilled pork cheeks, butter chicken, chicken tandoori, satay, sashimi, cheese selection. The restaurant layout can get a little confusing, staffs are attentive and helpful. Would definitely return :
5
Had been here for 4 times. All 4 times were good experience. From the food to the service, couldn't ask for more. Just yesterday which I brought my friend along for her birthday celebration. She enjoyed the food and ambience so much. She finds the services good as well. This was her 1st time there.Forgotten to thank the waitresses who made my friend's day by giving her a mini birthday cake together with a birthday song for her. She was caught by surprise and she was happy about it. Thank you again for making an unforgettable birthday for my friend. Will definitely going down again in the future

We stay at the Pan Pacific for the Grand Prix and decided to extend our stay by two nights, and included breakfast. What a disappointment. The service was less than average, at time it was none existent. The buffet was a rather hot potch affair, with no natural flow. Toaster did not work properly. Food labelling was poor. None on the jams had labels, and I observed at least two customers having a taste. There were an insufficent number of tongs,spoons to serve the food, so I observed cross contamination. And if you have any allergies then you are doomed, as there were no descriptions, of what ingredients were, in the foods. Thankfully my husband tasted one of the dishes which had fish, which I am allergic to, otherwise I may have been spending my vacation in an A & E dept. For a 5 star hotel it was very disappointing

Singapore is known for its buffets, and Edge always ranks highly in the published lists of favourites-- it deserves to because it's great! Firstly, it's located in one of Singapore's most interesting hotel lobbies-- the soaring multi story atrium is quite spectacular and worth a visit just for a look. If you like before dinner, you can have a drink in the bar in the lobby-- again a great space with lots of interesting seating options. Onto the buffet. The only real problem is you can't try everything because the choice is so large-- my wife and I had a red hot go however! She started with crab legs, not just one or two, but three full plates- covered the price of admission just there. I went Japanese, with some excellent sushi and sashimi, the latter sliced to order. We then went to the grill, where you select some marinated meat ( we tried chicken & beef) and it's cooked and brought to your table. We tried a range of other dishes to follow, & finished with some outstanding deserts, cheese and expresso. All the while, our plates were taken away promptly, finger bowls for the crab eater were replaced regularly, and the chefs at the cooking stations were proud to talk about their dishes. We selected a number of lovely wines by the glass from a reasonably short and not cheap list, which perfectly complimented the food. The cost was $88 per head plus drinks-- for this you got outstanding food, in an environment more like a fine diner than a buffet. We've been to many good buffets around the world-- Edge ranks right up with the top ones we've eaten at. Great nightPS Easy to get to the hotel by MRT - use the city circle line & get off at Promenade & it's a 200 metre wal
5
Staff were friendly , prompt and the presentation of food was simply excellent . We had the international buffet . Highly recommended !
4
I had a wonderful breakfast at Edge this morning. There were different islands of food counters featuring Japanese, Chinese, Malaysian, Indian, Western style breakfast, etc. The dining area is so big that I almost got lost after reaching out for food for the first time.
4
Went on fish night and the selection was extensive. The prawns and lobster were fresh and really tasty. Some of the dishes were a bit of a miss, but I guess you would expect that with a buffet.
4
Always find the varieties of food serve is fascinating! Truly international buffet spread! A very special dessert to recommend... raspberry truffle chocolate! Heavenly! Not to mention there is alot alot more! Service is very good and professional too... when i book the table stating it's for my gf's bdae... they actually prepare a slice of chocolate cake for us... and the staffs actually came to sing birthday song for my gf... aw... so sweet...
5
I brought my wife for a surprise birthday dinner. When we found the place, we were amazed at the ambience and the decors. We were then promptly attended and brought to our seats by the window. It was a start of a memorable dining experience as we survey the delightful buffet spread and wonderful layout. Having eaten many buffets, I know that the spread doesnâ€™t necessarily translate to food of splendid quality. But as we tried a bit of almost everything, we were thrilled by the quality especially the seafood and sashimi section. There is also a good selection of wines to pair our food with. But being in the customer service sector myself, I understand that often, a good product may be spoilt by a poor customer service at the front line. From my first dining experience at Edge, I would say that the customer service quality is excellent. The service crew are attentive to our needs and yet not overly intrusive. They anticipate our needs in advance and greet us warmly. I would especially single out Sarah, the trainee who went the extra mile to cater to our needs. I observed that she not only have the proper skill sets but also an excellent service attitude and my wife and I were really impressed. Thanks Edge for the memorable dining experience

Great service. Affordable price for a hotel buffet. A LOT of options. They even have different themes everyday for their buffet. Went there on a Saturday for lunch and the theme was "Makan-Makan" which focused on local food. Kept going back to the satay station and the Prawn Noodle was superb. Two thumbs up

Top class buffet with one of the most diverse spreads I've seen. They have EVERYTHING! Service was prompt, seating was spread out so you don't feel like you're sitting in a food court (unlike some other hotel buffets). Value for money and will definitely be bac

I organized a dinner for about 50 people in my team. When I arrived, 4 huge tables were prepared for us, all nicely labelled for easy identification. The food, as usual, was very good (this was our 2nd visit - because our guys loved it the first time); my personal favourites were the roast beef (medium rare and so much marbling) and the swordfish sashimi, although I saw that a lot of my colleagues attacked the crabs. Service was fantastic; we mainly had our servers Sarah and K.C. to thank for that. They were aware that this was a company event and we had a budget, so they took the initiative to always check with me when my colleagues ordered things outside the buffet to get my confirmation on how it should be billed. All in all I was very happy with their efficiency and professionalism

I didn't research this restaurant like I normally would but we were staying at the Pan Pacific and it was our last night so we thought we'd give it a try. The in-room literature didn't mention it was a buffet (@ all-you-can-eat) and had I known I would have prepared properly (starve then gorge). The variety of food was excellent to the point we couldn't try food from all stations. That said, if I'm in Asia I don't want to eat pizza and roasts. There's a huge emphasis on seafood and my dining partner doesn't eat a lot of seafood so couldn't try as much as I did. If I had to be critical I'd say quite a lot of the seafood was overlooked. That's probably because it's cooked properly then sits under a heat lamp or in a Bain-marie for some time. We were a bit shocked when it came to paying the bill ($SG210 for two) but when we thought about the type of food (scallops, crab, prawns, lobster) and quantity we had eaten it was actually quite reasonable. The alcoholic drinks were very expensive though so we only had two small ones each ($SG17 for a Tiger beer and $SG18 for a glass of house wine). As we were guests at the hotel we got 20% off the bill which made it even more reasonable.I'd agree with another reviewer that there's not really any 'theater' at the restaurant so don't expect to see food flying across the room or plates of flaming delights being delivered to your table.Tip - if you're going to the buffet dinner make sure you go hungry, have a good walk around the different stations before you fill your first plate and be prepared to pay at least $SG100 per person. You will leave satisfied and very full

One of the must try buffet if you are a tourist here.Had my brunch with family today and although there are hits and misses, it is still worththe $$$ for tourist to try our local food here. Service is top notch throughout the brunch( except for 2 particular staff,, and also when we left there were no thank you or see you again thingy despite us walking past 4 staff wihch was talking among themselves.. not that I mind...Cant be too demanding nowadays ) Ambience and environment is 5 star rating.As for food, there are quite a good local spread ranging from laksa, satay ,fried rice to my fav alcohol choc...although the seafood deprt seems to be a bit lacking as the scallops is way too small and prawns are abit too hard. Would have give it a 5 star if there are more choices in the seafood spread

Came here for New Year's Day Celebration with my in laws because they serve wagyu beef. The so called wagyu is even worst than normal beef. Very disappointing.
5
I definitely recommend people to come here to eat for chill out, birthday party event etc.The ambiance is amazing facing the Singapore flyer. The service is excellent. The quality of food is awesome. For people who love cheese, sashimi, seafood, beef, lamb, pork, chicken rice, pasta etc. This is the restaurant that can provide of the best and finest food that you can think of, ask for or even imagine. In summary, really bring your family, friends etc to here and appreciate the moment of awesome food because I promise you would love to eat all you can. The time for the buffet is perfect especially from 6pm to 10pm/1030pm

We reserved a big table for the seafood and local food spread to celebrate my Aunt's birthday as well as National Day in Sg. The dining concierge was considerate and allocated a good location for our large group of 15 pax without me leaving further instructions. Food spread was so wide that the young & old crowd amongst us were smiling ear to ear - everyone has food which they love to eat and were simply pleased.Service crew were friendly & attentive. Food prepared by the individual stations were promptly sent to table throughout the night.We totally enjoyed ourselves and planned to return for another round of celebration!

Waouh ! It is just Waouh ! This brunch is impressive' you have absolutely everything you can dream about, my favorite: superbe selection of seafood, excellent selection of cheeses, great meat (mmm this little pig....), excellent ham, and a real free flow of Veuve Cliquot: this is happiness! Despite a final price quiet high (178$++/head that are infact almost 220$ including taxes...), with an excellent service and fantastic food, I can't wait to be back

We went on the Jubilee Lunch. It was meant for gathering to celebrate my son's birthday. The thoughtful restaurant did prepare a small slice of cake with a candle FOC for us. We didn't want to get a cake so that we can enjoy the wide spread of desserts available. Is very nice & sweet. There is a waitress or waiter dedicated for couple tables. The waitress is always on the look. Clear our empty plates and refill water often. She even checked if you are 1st time there & explained to us how to order live cooked food. There is a few items for each type of cuisine. Though I was expecting like kids favourite soba & chawamushi but I was surprised by the oden and some tempura & chicken karrage. I would say there's good food standard. Freshness is there, Quality is there. My family love the thin hot pizzas, salmon sashimi, prawns, scallops, crayfish, beef leg, smoke salmon, laksa, satay, white pepper crab, cakes, icecreams.... yum yum. fresh brew coffee...:) I think only the chinese roasted & the dim sum are slightly not there only. We had a great time. 2-1/2hrs lunch just don't seems enough

The services in edge is awesome especially one of the restaurant guest executive Janice Chan her services is incredible and the food are wide spread, the noodle station is good and salad station can makes you create your own salad and sandwiches. Will go there often since I'm their member and with good quality of foods. Strongly introduce to people like buffet and like casual feeling while eating.Can look at this linkhttps://www.facebook.com/mangie.mi.9/media_set?set=a.10206204762372459.1073741868.1066541662&type=3&pnref=stor

The place is quiet. Not as noisy as some of the other buffet restaurants. U wun see ppl "snatching" food here. Very spacious. U got ur own privacy. Staffs are making their rounds frequently to meet customers need. Fast topping up food as well. The food wun disappoint u. We ate alot.almost everything! All nice! Price is acceptable. If u sign up for their membership, u get 20% off and complimentary parking.We celebrated my bf bday here. N I requested a surprise bday cake for him when I made reservation. The staffs were very helpful and understanding. It went well eventually. Thanks for ur help guys. ;

Could not fault our experience. Though we did not stay at the hotel, we did visit Edge restaurant for our 1st Sunday brunch in Singapore. Did some digging to chose the right restaurant and it did not disappoint. A group of 11 joined me to celebrate my wife's birthday, 'you can't please all the people all of the time' but with such a variety of divine cuisine everyone was happy. The spread and definitely the quality was truly outstanding and I highly rrecommend Edge restaurant for a Sunday brunch. Well worth the trip to Singapore and this made it more special
5
I have been here twice and the food is simply awesome. The choices are tremendous. You can find any food you can think of. The Laksa is the best at Edge. In my group I have had people start and end with Laksa. This is a must visit if you are thinking of hosting somebody for a meal. If you have a Citibank card, there are great offers. On a birthday, the birthday person gets to eat free with 3 paying adults and gets complimentary cake and wine

Whilst staying at the Pan Pacific Hotel earlier this month we visited their Edge Restaurant for the Wednesday Seafood Buffet. Unfortunately, we were disappointed with the experience.Our first disappointment occurred when ordering from the cook to order stations. Each table has sticks with the table number on it and you are required to present the sticks when you order at the cook to order station. At two of the stations we ordered two portions of each dish and offered two sticks, however each time we were told they only required one stick, which seemed odd to us but they were adamant so we let it go. It was, therefore, no surprise to us that, after a 30 minute wait, only one serve of each dish arrived. A waitress reordered one of the dishes on our behalf but we had to wait a further 30 minutes. We didn't bother reordering the other dish as we didn't want to wait yet another 30 minutes.The quality of the food was, in our opinion, not very good. The Maine lobster was dry and overcooked and the seafood chowder which arrived in a small ramekin with a pie crust, consisted of a white sauce containing one small prawn, a chewy piece of calamari and a small opened mussel shell. I never did locate the mussel meat.Perhaps the biggest surprise to us was what we considered to be an extremely poor variety of deserts. The choice of cakes was very small and uninteresting.Service was adequate.I have visited the buffet at Carousel at the Royal Plaza Hotel and would rate that far and above in terms of choice and quality to that which we experienced at Edge.
5
If you're looking for a fine spread, this is the place to be. A good range of international food from Seafood, to Satay, Laksa, Indian food, Sashimi, Pizza to Dessert, the tourist visiting will have a good time tasting local cuisine all under one roof.

So much to choose from-- Every type of fresh food imaginable
All excellently prepared
Wait staff- excellent
Highly recommend-- come hungry

Four hours of necking unlimited Veuve Cliquot, lobster, oysters and wagu beef...? Yes please.Very good Sunday brunch experience with lots of stations, including seafood, sushi, roasts, dumplings and pretty much anything else you could think of wanting for brunch. Not only was it champagne on offer but there was a cocktail station preparing Mojitos. Surprisingly there was also beer, red and white wine for the taking too. We literally filled our boots and practically rolled out of there come 4pm. I reckon I probably eat four lobsters, drank one bottle of red to myself and probably managed to plough through two bottles of champagne at least. An excellent and very gluttonous experience. Good service, good food and excellent amounts of good quality booze! A must for an avid Sunday drinker and good value for approximately £75 a head
5
We were here for my dad's birthday. He's the typical tough to please chinese dad and even he was impressed with the food and service. Edge is also the first buffet place where he actually said we should come here again. A very big thank you to Layla, Jega and Steven who actually sang a birthday song for my dad and re-sang the song when I asked them to fake it so I could pose a pic on instragram! We spent 3hrs here, had so much fun, ate till our belly almost burst and i regretted spending father's day at goodwood park. I sincerely recommend people to come here especially if you have a special event going on and would like to have a enjoyable dinner for loved ones

OMG! What can you say, excess of everything your heart could desire, there is a section fro everything desserts, breads, cheese i could go on for a while, the mains are set out by cuisine so there is a section for sea food, Indian, Sushi, dumplings, roasts etc. etc. then there are sections where you can order something to be made fresh, steak, Lamb chops ceviche, a fish section, a salad section, a guy making fresh pasta to order the list could go on and on. Everything i had was awesome, i saved my space for the meats and shell fish, but whatever you’re vice is it is here! Not cheap at first sight but when you consider you have had four hours of eating and drinking as much as you want of some of the best food available and great champagne its not bad for the money. Service was fantastic and we were well gone with the champagne by the time we got ushered out. Great Day
5
Excellence service render by one of the chef at the dessert section! Knowing that my daughter has strict diet requirement, the chef offered to prepare her a gluten-free cake, which really made the day for my girl. Indeed this is called service with a heart and going the extra mile in making the whole dining experience memorable.

My wife & I returned to the Pan Pacific 24 years after coming here on Honeymoon. The hotel has aged more gracefully than we have & looks terrific inside & out. The Edge International Buffet restaurant is the best of its type I've been in. Japanese sushi & sashimi was wonderful. Peking duck was perfectly prepared and plentiful. Everything else looked fresh & well prepared too,I didn't leave enough room for dessert but still managed to fill and empty a plateful - I recommend the coffee pannacotta and the coffee meringues. Check it out if you're nearby and very hungry

Went for Father's Day dinner and when we booked, we mentioned its for birthday as well, it's my hubby's birthday month. They surprised us at the end of the evening with a slice of birthday cake and the manager and a few service stuff came to sing the happy birthday song.The selection of the buffet is huge-- ranging from Chinese station, Indian, western, BBQ, Japanese and seafood. The dessert selection is huge as well, chocolate fondue, Peranakan sweets, chocolates, ice cream

This being in The Pan Pacific Hotel meant that the area for Edge is very spacious. Food choice is amazing from all aover the world and many dishes are cooked to order and then brought to your table. Will happily return on my next visit to Singapore . I found that the food quality was better then in Equinox but you don't get the high rise view
5
International spread buffet. Selection is competent for its price point.The meat cuts, seafood spread, asian and jap cuisine are ample in quantity and quality. The dessert section deserves a special mention. Love the bread pudding!The buffet spread would be fantastic IF the beverage section could be expanded to the same menu as the breakfast.Nonetheless, the dining experience is what one would come to expect from a 5 star hotel. You get what you paid for. The service assistant, Kandiban, deserves a special mention, who attended to my family was extremely helpful and polite. Sometimes, the dining experience is made more pleasant by the excellent attitude of the staff. Good food + wonderful staff + service = unbeatable dining experience.My 4th stay in Pan Pac for local staycation and edge has always delivered

amazing spread, very good value for the money, perfect place with family as well as with the friends, very prompt service staff. seafood areas are well maintained and awesome desserts.well done chefs !!! well recommended !

One of the awsome buffet in singapore.. had a good time..thanks to staff (Helen)..for suprise anniversary pastry..

We had breakfast here every day of our stay. The service and food was fantastic. There was something for everyone Thai Chinese Indian and European dishes absolutely wonderful. The best was the omelette station made to order yum !!

Went to the Edge on 2 occasions, the great sunday brunch, aswell as Meat Galore "Cuts" on a Tuesday. Both times great spread, good food and awesome service. On Sunday's avoid the boozed up bunch by asking for a table near the Asian food. This review is in particular for the service level experienced everytime at Edge. Very attentive and proactive staff on all stations. I would like to specially recommend Sarah, our server last Tuesday (10/6/2015). Not only was she proactive (For example; noticing what I had plated on my way back to my table, and then quickly delivering a finger bowl to wash my hands after the seafood) she also maintained the area well (ensuring there were no dirty plates on the table) and ensured that the buffet looked impeccable by aligning everything after guests had scooped up food, and running to the kitchen to get clean serving spoons. And all with a beautiful smile!Had a great time on both occasions! Our stomachs suffered afterwards...but in a very good way

The dinner buffet was fine, though not quite the theater promised. For a crowded hotel restaurant, the noise level was acceptable. Note that much of the Trip Advisor praise is for breakfast; you might not need to venture here for a copious dinner buffet at this price point in Singapore. The heft of some of the other clients is perhaps a warning.Go hungry, because it will be SGD100+ each. Grill was fine, pastas fresh, sushi OK, salad bar skimpy, and drink expensive, even for Singapore. The stations were copiously provided, and everything was clearly labelled. Seafood to shell was plentiful. The desserts were the best, part of the evening, including an in-season durian pudding, an delicious truffles.Some of the food under hot lamps dried out so you have to be selective.We liked the birthday mini-dessert, but this is not romantic or special occasion by any means. That the server hovered to see if he'd get an extra tip was a tacky end to an OK evening, distinguished more by the company than the food. Declare is Singapore sleek modern

I had a breakfast business meeting with one of your guest in Pan Pacific. At first I was impressed with the designed of your hotel. As I entered the restaurant named EDGE, the staff greeted me warmly welcome by Amy and Irish, as I was lead to our table, Irish explained the buffet and ask me of what coffee I want. The cappuccino taste great. While we are having our conversation, it caught my attention this indian man named Kandiban, he was coughing non stop not covering his mouth and his attitude was rude. That was disgusting. Staff is sick yet still working. His passing all the virus and not hygienic. That is terrible. Thats how we decided to go to other place to continue our meeting. Scrambled eggs was excellent. Compliment to the chef. I hope the management will do something about this. Thank you.

I was here with my family last thursday to celebrate my graduation and it was the first time I have been here since it came under the new name! The spread was really good and theme that night was seafood! Love the chilli clayfish,bbq seafood and other live stations. The sashimi area and dessert area was really impressive too! We were served by Jega who was really courteous and attentive to our needs. Some of the staffs were also seen singing birthday songs for other tables:

Had gone for dinner with my family members. Have found the spread to be good, with western, Indian, peranakan, Chinese, Thai and Japanese fare.Quality of food is good. The Thai section can be a delight at times. The dessert section, I like it best for the soft chocolates. Had found it to be value for money. Will go again.:

My husband and I went for the buffet lunch at the edge, as we were staying in the Pan Pacific hotel. We had not booked prior but there was no issue with a table. The waitress showed us round all the different food stations, there was everything you could think off. Most impressive for me was the fish station with endless amounts of sushi, scallops, oysters and prawns and all very good quality. They also cooked fresh dishes to your preference so it was not the kind of buffet were they put out all the food and just keep it warm. My favourite had to be dessert, I was quite literally a kid in a sweet shop, dessert had its own room with endless amounts of cookies, ice cream, marshmallows, chocolate, cakes and the chocolate fountain - just incredible! I would definitely recommend

Visted Edge on 9 May for Breakfast, came as a group of 11 and was impress. The food selection for breakfast is extensive and good. They do not compromise Quality over Quantity which is fantastic. I must say, the sautÃ©ed mushrooms were very delicious and and the musli was nice. Service here could be improved however I believe our waiter, Lady, Her name starts with J. I do apologise as I have forgotten your name. She was fantastic. Thank you very much. Will come back soon. The buffet here is extensive and good. Joe Le

Really great layout and atmosphere. Excellent selection and diversity in the food. And quality is outstanding. Service also very kind
4
We stayed @ pan pacific for 5 nights, and had our breakfast there every morning, lots of choice, Asian and western! We also had dinner there on the first night, the food was very nicely cooked & loved chocolate mousse & creme brulee!
5
So much choice! A taste of around the world on a special night! If you have a good appetite certainly recommended. A great choice and excellent quality, service top class !
5
The Edge, the restaurant in Pan Pacific Singapore Hotel, offers the best breakfast in all Singapore, with huge varieties of food and cuisines from all over the world. Unforgettable experience, highly recommended!
5
Spent my Sunday having the edge brunch buffet and was pleasantly surprised with their range of food and high service standards.
2
If you look local and need to come here for a lunch meeting, this isn't your smartest choice. Food is okay. But all the servers seem angry and impolite. We got scolded on two occasions when we told them they messed up our coffee order. I like the part when my client walked up to the dessert counter and was met with "What you want now?" Yikes. But the food is okay
4
We dined here for breakfast five times out of the six nights we stayed at the Pan Pacific Hotel. They have great options, ranging from Indian, Chinese and Japanese items to the usual Western pastries, omelettes, bacon and ham etc. I liked the nasi lemak and the fact that they changed the side dishes, such as sambal eggs and fishballs, daily. The rice also goes great with the otah. The prata on the Indian side tended to be a little hard, perhaps as they were cooked earlier. I also liked the dimsum, such as siew mais (steamed pork bundles) which were very tasty. We never tried the noodle and omelette sections, as they tended to be popular and the queues were rather long.Our favourite section was the juice bar, which was manned by a very friendly elderly lady. She helped to make our breakfast even more enjoyable and we certainly missed her on her day off. It does tend to get quite crowded so it might be good to arrive early at 7 am or a little later at 9 pm. Besides the normal tea and coffee on offer, they also provide blended teas - I recommend the Earl Grey with lavender tea
4
Edge is one of the many hotel buffet restaurants in Singapore that offers a very expansive spread of Pacific and Western cuisines. The quality and taste of the food is pretty good and you can find something for everyone in the different "theater" stations for cuisines from all over the world. I do find the desserts to be outstanding and worth the visit. If you like chocolate, the melt-in-your-mouth red wine and green tea chocolate are not to be missed
5
We enjoyed a relaxed and luxurious breakfast each morning of our stay at Pan Pacific Hotel. There are 7 stations ( I think) and we had to get directions from staff on how we were to proceed. By 2nd morning we knew exactly what to do. You are seated by staff and given coffee or tea and then you can enjoy visiting the various stations to have fresh hot food prepared for you or to collect your fresh fruit and juice. Various foods for various nationalities. Quite sumptuous and presented with care
2
After arriving at the Pan Pacific hotel, we were dead tired from our flights and thought we'd just grab a bite to eat in the hotel. Normally we don't eat in hotels and prefer to explore restaurants out in the city we are visiting, but we were just too tired this time. Well, we should have summoned the energy, because this was a very disappointing meal. The concept of Edge is one that either appeals to you or not. Essentially an all-you-can-eat buffet, but arranged in stations (7 or 8, I think) each with a different type of food. Food is a combination of already prepared on heat stations, and cook to order. I guess we were on the late side (21:30), but the food that was out looked old and dried - pizza, meats, potatoes, etc. For the price of S$86 per person, you expect a lot better than that at any time of day. The cook-to-order pasta was about the only thing we got that was decent. From looking around, it appeared that the best value was obtained by those loading up on the seafood (crab legs, etc), which I guess is similar to any buffet style restaurant. Service was adequate, but nothing special.Total cost for two, including one glass of wine each: S$244For comparison, the following night we had a great meal at a French restaurant table side on the river, entree and mains, cocktail each plus a nice bottle of Bordeaux wine for S$300 (for two). Unless you are going to eat your way into value, avoid this restaurant.
5
One of the best buffets experience! The quantity and quality of food was excellent and well worth the price. Service was top notch and lots of seats which made it comfortable.
5
The most extensive Brunch in Singapore with the biggest choice (the only one that can beat this "normal" Sunday brunch is the RitzCarlton twice a year SuperBrunch. Otherwise, I LOVE the great service and best of all the wagyu station is one of the best. Wonderful meat. It is also one of the longest brunches you can have lasting from 12 to 4 pm. Price is comparable to other brunches around town. Cheaper if you don't take the alcohol.
5
We had dinner here on 15 Mar. I've eaten at some of the 'best' buffets in Singapore like Melt, The Line, Carousel, etc and I would rank Edge the best of the lot. Be wary that they may be inconsistent at times. It's my second time at this place and the first experience does not match up to this recent one, which I rate extremely highly. Note that there's just so much food it is impossible to try everything. Get that out of your system otherwise you'll be wasting your stomach space on a lot of unnecessary stuff. Go for only things that you would like. Most of the food I had, I would actually pay a la carte prices. The prawns and alaskan king crabs were excellent, bursting with sweetness and flavour. The sashimi wasn't as impressive, but still above average. You can ask for salmon belly. I highly recommend the live stations. The laksa and roast duck are definitely better than your average hawker standard.I just wish I could have more of just the above but there was just so much more to eat. Pork rib soup had the right balance with tender meat sliding off the bone. Cheese penne, cooked to order spaghetti carbonara were another two dishes that were guiltily carbo-packed but irresistible. We wanted only a taste of them but ended up almost finishing everything. The bbq was delicate. The best bbq I've had in years. It's really quite shocking that buffet could be this good. Here and there, the other hot dishes had some gems and they qualify above the usual buffet standards but they don't stand out as much after you've tried the live stations. Cheese section was decent but the real cherry at the end was the dessert section. We are looking at fresh and warm puddings and pies and soft chocolates and beautifully delicate penna cottas. And that's not even talking about the icecream and waffles yet. Basically we would definitely be back very soon. The service was impeccable. The tall gentleman at the entrance looked after us really well and dishes were cleared and water was topped up promptly. If you want a world class buffet, come to the Edge and have a long unhurried session with good conversation and food. This would be a great way to spoil yourself

If you are looking for international buffet, this will not go wrong as the variety of food is amazing here....However, if you are a food lover whom goes for quality food and services... In my opinion, it's over rated here. Firstly, the quality of food is only acceptable. If you are hoping for delicious food.... You may be disappointed. 1 simple basic dish - fried Chicken Wings are burnt and tasted burnt. Next, there seems to be shortage of staff during my visit. Our ice water is not auto-top up... We need to look around for service staff to assist to refill the ice water. In my opinion, it's not really worth to pay for such SGD88 ++, that comes up to about SGD103 per pax.It's my first visit here and I will not want to return soon for the cost does not match the quality of food and compromise in service due manpower shortage
4
Wonderful buffet lunch ongoing Verve what more can you ask for fun ambience, not romantic, not species just lots of good food good champagne and a very merry Christmas in Singapore. A wonderful way to enjoy Christmas Day if your looking for a Hotel at Christmas in Singapore
5
Excellent buffet starting at 12 and going on till 1500. Multi cuisine with live counters . Their sushi was awesome , the laksa excellent . The salad counter was terrific . Loved the pork dishes and of course not to mention the vol au vent!!! Desserts were good the children loved the chocolate fountain with its range to go with ! the mango sago was exceptionally good too . Plenty available for the veggies l . The ambience was perfect for the lazy Saturday ..and the leisurely pace was something to savour !!!

Went for lunch with the family during the recent festive season and I was surprised that the place was still quite packed. It's definitely one of the better hotel buffets I've been to with a good spread of chinese, indian, malay, western, salads and a dessert section that wow's you. To be objective, not every single dish is exciting or would be considered as delish but with such a good spread, just pick and choose what tickles your fancy. I didn't try every single dish but I was happy enough with what I liked. Must try - freshly cut sashimi, prawn dumplings, curry laksa, salmon and beef from the western section and of course the chocolates, creme brulee and durian pengat from the dessert section.A word of advise - ask to be seated away from where the food counters are. You will have a much more pleasant dining experience. ;-)PS: I rated this as Average for Value as I paid full price and am not one of those that can really stuff my face silly at buffets. However, there are credit cards offers which would definitely offer better Value for diners
4
Ambience: Good view, cosy and spacious layout.Service: 5 star hotel standard, prompt and respectful Variety: Probably the largest out there in SingaporeQuality: There are no the best food item at Edge, almost every item is above average. Final verdict: If you are those who prefer a large variety of good quality food, the edge is definitely a place to frequent. I must say its the most worthwhile choice for an international buffet
5
It's a very good spread of seafood and others international food. Their food was simply fabulous. As compare to other 5 stars hotel that I have dine. So far this is a very good wan. A Rose for the lady who dine here during valentine days. And the main theme was 13 variety of crab. Love it so much
4
This is the best buffet I had so far in Singapore.Although I called to make a booking and the lady answered that it "seems" like it was fully booked without asking me for how many.I called again few minutes later, another lady answered and took my booking.Anyway, this is the best range of choices that I've seen.Everything is very high quality and nothing is neglected. The seafood section is fresh and colorful, big highlight on the oysters, crab claws and sashimi. The desserts were good, especially the apple crumble (that contained big raisins and walnuts) with that delicious mascarpone.Nice tea Very worth the pric
5
This is a wonderful restaurant to begin your day,lot of choices for everybody.They provide you Indian,European,Chinese option,apart from variety of Fruits and juices.The service is good and very particular about timings.
4
This place is definitely a must try for buffet goers. Highly recommended:
i) widest spread of food in Singapore
ii) fresh seafood
iii) tasty food
iv) competitively priced
v) excellent service
vi) cozy ambiance
Can't go wrong if you are a big eater.

My partner and I visited in January 2015 for the dinner buffet on a Saturday night. We were glad we made a reservation as it was almost booked out and people that didn't make a reservation were being seated a fair way away from the buffet.We ordered beers and sparkling water. We decided not to order wine as because it's Asia, it is excessively taxed which makes cheap bottles of wine very expensive.The buffet was expansive with every type of cuisine you can imagine, with many different love cooking stations. They give you little chopsticks at your table with your table number to hand to the chef so that they can deliver the freshly cooked dish to your table.We especially enjoyed the sushi and in the seafood section, the crab legs were the biggest we had seen and were very tasty. Also be sure to try the Singapore Chilli Crab and Sambal Crayfish, which were fantastic.The dessert section was good, but not the best spread we have seen at a buffet before.Once the service charge and tax is added it did become a very expensive dinner, but in saying that, it was very enjoyable and we would definitely consider returning

I sampled the buffet breakfast here during my recent stay at Pan Pacific. Edge is a very large restaurant and the buffet breakfast offers many food options including Indian, Japanese and European options with sections including an egg station, cereals, fresh fruit, pancakes and waffles and baked goods. Yet despite this huge range, I was not totally impressed with the food I had. The bacon was very dry and the donuts in the pastry section did not seem fresh. The toaster was set to a ridiculously light setting and a fellow diner and I were not impressed when the toast we had put in the toaster was rudely picked up by another diner who pushed in ahead of us! The tea was not very hot and the waitresses were not always diligent about promptly refilling our cups. I have had buffet breakfasts at many hotels in Asia and I can honestly say that whilst this one offered plenty of variety, it was not worth the $56 price tag: unless, of course, you are able to consume vast amounts of food

EDGE is one of the best buffet restaurants you could find in Singapore. Food here is more than abundant with choices of most Asian and selected Western cuisines.The restaurant is more spacious than other buffet restaurants in Singapore, so you would not feel crowded during weekends. Ambience and presentation are also very good. This place is ideal for family or friends gathering. Book a table if you'd like to have a wonderful feast for special occasions
5
The restaurant was well located with a great view of Singapore with the Singapore Flyer in the background. The spread of food was just fantastic. The dining area was spacious and even though it was full-house we did not feel congested nor disturbed. It was just a great place for families as well as for friends or business. There was only one minor complaint. The waitress who served our drinks appeared rough or perhaps inexperienced. She poured water for the person next to me with her arm across my face while I was eating, and it happened a few times. Needs more training

Having read the mostly positive reviews posted by guest, wanted to also add my thoughts albeit with a slight differences. We chose to dine at the 9 to 1030 pm time slot both to ascertain if the 50% discount ($50 net each) also meant a diluted dining experience and also because we had a prior engagement which only concluded at 830 pm.Will rate the following out of a scale of 10 with 10 being excellent.Arrival : 3We presented ourselves at the front of the cafe at 903 (having previously made our reservation for 9 pm). The person manning the cashier with 3 of her colleagues were unfortunately trying to settle the bill of guests who had completed their meal. After waiting for a full 5 minutes, with no attempt by the cashier or any of her 3 colleagues to sit us, i had to interrupt and ask to be seated. A Maitre d to seat guest who have been welcomed.Spread of food : 10As mentioned by other guest, all the stations were still serving food and we enjoyed the full spread even at this late hour.Value for money : 10At 50% discount, it was truly a bargain to dine on seafood, local favorites and even durian puree. Excellent value.Staff:7/10 to the staff waiting on us, clearing our plates while multitasking and setting the place up for brekky the next morningStaff at the live cooking stations 6/10It is perfectly understandable for staff(chefs) manning the cooking stations to mill around among themselves and have a chat since guest flow was at a minimum. However, when guest are hovering around their stations, they should make an effort to break off their conversations and engage guest to see how they can be served or at least make an effort to introduce their cuisine on offer. There was another station where the chef manning it was totally missing. I had to ask a passing waitress if that particular station was actually opened for the 9 to 1030 pm deal. I placed my order with that waitress. I then discovered the chef manning this station was actually in another cooking station having a chat with his colleagues (he left his station to return to his animated discussion after cooking my order). Unsure if this was standard practice and if the occasion warranted leaving his station without a cook but thankfully, this observation is only limited to 2 stations.Cashier 5/10At around 1020 pm, the cashier came up to my table and presented me with the bill. I found this rather strange as I have not indicated I was ready to pay. Although I was almost completing my dessert and was about to make my way to the cashier 5 minutes later, we left with the impression we had exhausted our welcome and she was more interested in closing her accounts and balancing her books. Other establishments with more rigorous staff training with "the buffet is closing in 5 minutes, would you like to help yourselves to anything else" was sadly missing.Patrons must also be prepared for wait staff preparing and setting the tables up for brekky the next morning while they are dining. That being said, the 9 to 1030 dining experience is a good option to consider

The meal started out wonderfully. Until I ate some Mac and cheese and discovered it had prawns in it. No sign or indication it had prawns in it (terrifying for someone with a shellfish allergy). I told the waitress. She apologised. That's it. Then they cut up a durian at the desert area. It stunk out our table. We asked if we could move. The woman never came back.

We celebrated our New Year eve of 2014 at this restaurant. We were greeted with a glass of sparkling champagne and smiling welcome. There were a dozen stalls with raw, cooked, grilled and roasted food catering to all types of tastes. We had baked duck, grilled fish and very tasty roasted chicken. All the dishes were very well prepared. There was a large spread of sea food and deserts and much more. The whole environment was festive. Staff very courteous and helpful. Over experience was very satisfying. Our host residing in the Pan Pacific Hotel informed us that this restaurant always has such tasty dishes and courteous staff

I celebrated my wedding anniversary here on a weekday. It was crowded as it was the festive season. However, the restaurant did not disappoint. It was an international buffet spread and the selection was awesome! There was Thai food, asian, indian, Japanese, Western etc.. The laksa was absolutely the best we ever had; the beef steak was more tender than chicken; sambal crayfish was to die for; the dessert counter was absolutely sinful!!! Perhaps due to the crowd, our grilled sausage turn out ice cold inside. The server, Danny immediately apologised and offered to reorder the sausage for us. We tried the other spicy pork sausage and did not fancy it, hence we turned down his kind offer. We also ordered rojak but due to a miscommunication, our order was wrong. It was disappointing to have 2 wrong orders during the meal, however, we still enjoyed ourselves greatly.What impressed us the most was when we were eating their delicious black pepper crabs, Danny turned up with a stack of serviettes and a bowl of water with a lemon slice in it for us to wash our hands in to remove the crab smell. Awesome initiative Danny! Keep up the great job!!Upon settling the bill, we were offered complimentary parking. While the cost was only $2.20 for parking, we were still very happy for the kind thought. We will definitely return again
5
The food quality is really nice. Wide selection. Ambience is nice and cosy. Air con is cool. Staff is dress professionally and friendly. Price is expensive, dinner buffet is S$78 + 17% = S$91 per pax.
4
Ambience was good. Food quality is also good but selections was a bit boring in terms of limited sushi/sashimi items, Chinese store not appetising enough by looking at it.
5
A place where we could eat many kinds of food. My wife absolutely loved seafood here. The atmosphere was great and staffs were very helpful as well.
5
Too often I go to a buffet which is visually appealing but disappoints when I start eating! That's is definitely not the case at the Edge Buffet at the Pan Pacific in Singapore.It was not only a visual treat to walk around and look at the huge selection on offer, but when I got back to my seat with each plate, it was a culinary delight in my mouth.The traditional done excellently (the Beef Rendang simply awesome) and their personal twists done superbly (today the Roast Turkey was moist and full of flavour and the Tomahawk Wagyu Roast was perfection).The cook to order stations were also excellent.I didn't do the bubbles, so could stay sober and enjoy the food and that was a good call.Would rank this as Singapore's best Sunday Brunch buffet
5
While staying at the Pan Pacific, breakfast was included in our rate so we ate our morning meals at the Edge. I have NEVER seen a larger or more varied buffet—not even on a cruise ship. Fruits, cereals, breads, rolls, sweet rolls, various ethnic desserts, Thai, Chinese, Malaysian, Japanese, English, and American dishes are all represented at various stations along with made to order waffles, pancakes, and eggs of all kinds. Cold cuts, cheeses, salads, curries, stir fry, pad thai… the list is endless. Service is professional and attentive. The hostess, Jane, and manager, David, welcomed us each day by name making us feel even more welcome. A great way to start the day!On Sundays there is a four hour brunch that is extremely popular. Champagne is included int the price and reservations are usually necessary

Visited somewhere around November 2014. It was a company dinner and also my first time visiting the edge. It was a huge restaurant. Having dinner buffet with close to 40 pax. We have our own designated corner.A lots of variety for you to choose from, just nice it was Thursday dinner they offer seafood for that night. Yes I'm a seafood lover of course ill love it. Oysters, Alaskan king carb, white pepper crayfish one of the best. And etc. lots of live station where close to 10+ live station that chef will prepare your food inform of you. There will be a stick with table number on your table if the food needling er time to prepare they'll deliver to your table. The servers on that night explain to us clearly with the use of stick, if not wrong her name is Angela. Service was prompt. But one of the dishes on the grill station I never got it, I left my stick down there with the food, waited for more than 30+minutes still not served., but I do have some other food to satisfied me, don't even border to care about it. Will return for more if got chance. Never had the chance to tried the sweet as stomach was filled with all my favorite dishes before dessert

Sunday Champagne brunch at the Edge.What a great way to spend four hours on a lazy Sunday afternoon. Tough to book so get in early but if you do it is so worth it. It costs roughly £90 per person but we went for the Champagne option and had unlimited Veuve Clicquot served to us by the most charming South Korean waitress, who never let our glasses go empty. As for the food well we had Japanese steak, Lobster, prawns, crab and a lot more. It's a great way to spend the afternoon and perfect either just the two of you or in a party

I'm still puzzled by the Edge, a very large buffet restaurant in the Pan Pacific Hotel. The place is beautifully maintained, with numerous buffets of different cuisines, among them Chinese, Indian, Japanese, Western (carved/grilled meats, etc.), Seafood, and more. The grazing opportunities are endless and fun. But, as one might expect, the food quality is not quite at the same standard as the presentation. I did find the Indian offerings very nice and interesting. Japanese sushi, though, was not particularly good. Drinks and desserts are included with the fairly hefty price of the buffet. It is safe to say that one could visit the Edge three or four times and still not sample more than about half the offerings.The place is popular, and there is no discernable dress code. This is a fun place for a family group, not a spot for a high end, romantic dining experience. (There are other restaurants in the hotel that serve that purpose.
5
We had Sunday brunch in Edge. Apparently this restaurant is famous for Sunday Champagne brunch that lasts for 4 hrs. It is a shame that we couldnt enjoy Champagne today thou, we were able to enjoy amazing foods at $119++, instead of $178++ per pax.You might think that is too much for a brunch. But! Once you walked into Edge, you will change your mind! Im not a fan of buffet style as I dont enjoy sea food so much which is the most valuable food in the buffet and im not a big eater either. For those who dont enjoy seafood so much, Edge provides various various kinds of good quality cuisines,Japanese,Chinese, Malaysian, Italian, Western etc as well as well cookie-house-like-decorated desert sections. They not just provide various kinds of food but good quality and tasty food! Also each corner you could make an order of freshly cooked food such as pastas, steaks and lamb chops, sausages, hot noodles, satay etc. I tried wagyu steak and lamb chop and they tasted so tender and juicy!! What I like the most, I could get freshly squeezed fruit juice_apple, carrot and orange_ instead of soft drinks! If you are looking for restaurants for family gathering, this place looks suitable the most :
5
My favourite brunch in all of Singapore. The food is just fantastic, it's 4 hours long and the price is cheaper than some others... Do not go anywhere else! I can't wait to go back on Christmas Day!
5
Amazing variety of dishes from roast meats to sushi, curry to foie gras and Veuve Clicquot on tap. The best brunch by a long chalk.
4
You'd be spoilt for choice. However, it's worth it to fork out for an upgrade to Pacific Club. the Champagne breakfast at Pacific Club, whilst more limited in selection, is quieter and more exclusive.
5
You here the word buffet and think average food under heat laps. The total opposite. You will come back to this restaurant at the hotel Pan Pacific Singapore just for this buffet. It was perfect, 10 out of 10. The food and beverage director and executive chef should be so proud of what they have created, simply amazing.You will want for nothing and be overwhelmed on there choice of food.Simply the best buffet dinner I have ever had.

After partaking in Singapore's iconic street hawkers food stalls for lunch, we were ready to try a couple of Singapore's highly rated gourmet buffets- the Carousel and the Edge. Having been fortunate enough to dine at both on consecutive nights, my wife and I feel the Edge easily edges out the Carousel for the better gourmet buffet. This is how they both break down on a 1-10 scale in each of the following categories: FOOD QUALITY: Edge: 10 Carousel: 7 This is obviously very subjective depending on each person's personal preferences. However, having just spent 6 days eating cruise ship quality buffet food, my wife and I had a point of comparison. Both buffet offered Western, Asian, Indian and Seafood style food. However, the Edge definitely served the better seasoned and more authentic tasting foods. It was not the water downed flavoring and/or bland reproduction of the original served at many buffets. The quality of the produce and ingredients were better than Carousel. While Carousel had your usual hibachi counter, the Edge a number of fresh to order cooking stations, i.e. the Pasta and Barbecue stations.  SELECTION: Edge: 10 Carousel: 7. The Edge offers a greater selection and variety of food. The Edge's buffet is expansive. There must have been at least seven manned stations. The Carousel had about four smaller stations. The Edge's vast array of dessert options were excellent.  ATMOSPHERE/AMBIENCE: Edge: 10 Carousel: 6.0. When you are paying in this price point, there are certain expectations. Along with food quality, the atmosphere/ambience is also an important consideration. The Edge is located on the third floor of the Pan Pacific hotel, which is away from the hustle and bustle below. The restaurant is elegantly decorated. There is an air of sophistication and relaxation. The presentation of the restaurant and the food are beautiful. Highly recommend for special occasions, i.e. Anniversaries, birthdays etc... The Carousel was sheer craziness. The restaurant literally is located as you enter the Royal Plaza on Scotts off of Orchard Road. With much apologies to Carousel, it felt like a buffet placed in a busy shopping mall. The restaurant was less than elegant with plastic chairs and no table clothes. Service to clear the dishes was slow. There was a holder for forks, spoons and knives per person at the table. We had a feeling that once those utensils were utilized, there were no more replacements. LOCATION: Edge: 8 Carousel: 9. Due to the Carousel's location off of the touted Orchard Road's shopping district (highly overrated), the Carousel gets the edge. I suspect this is why the Carousel is so highly rated. However, the Edge, located inside the Pan Pacific Hotel,is a few minutes walk from the Promenade MRT station on the blue line. It is also a 5-10 minutes walk away from the Singapore Flyer- a perfect way to walk off the delectable food. VALUE: Edge: 10 Carousel: 5. The Edge easily surpasses the Carousel for value. Both buffets were essentially priced the same. However, the Edge significantly offers better quality food, selection and atmosphere for its price. Also, guests staying at the Pan Pacific Hotel may receive additional discounts. RECOMMENDATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS: 1) Whether you select the Edge or the Carousel, recommend making a reservation. We didn't have reservations with the Carousel and had to wait about 20-30 minutes. While the following day, we made reservations online with the Edge and were able to be seated earlier than our reserved time. 2) Personal recommendations at the Edge: a) the Crayfish b) Thai mango salad c) the plum ice cream d) creme brulee. Try it all. It is a buffet after all.In all fairness to the Carousel, had we only gone to the Carousel we would have rated it much higher. However, once dining at the Edge, there was a vast difference
5
Its my 1st time here at Edge @ Pan Pacific Hotel. It has a wide variety of cuisine for us to choose from japanese, thai, local, indian, western, seafood, dessert and etc. Each individual station has variety of dishes for us to choose from. Too many choices to decide which food to start with. Service was good. Nice and cosy ambience. Definitely worth the price to visit them again
5
I am used to buffet's in Hong Kong but I have never seen anything like this. An amazing extent of food. From Sushi to Pizza, an incredible dessert buffet to fresh fruit. I doubt there would be one person that couldn't find something here to love. My wife loved the Fishballs and noodle soup and my friend love the curry section.Usually quality is lost on such a big selection but I believe the food was of a very high quality. The service was also excellent
4
Superb food selection covering asian, indian, western and seafood meals. Best meal is easily the breakfast and the dinner is also outstandingA big issue i had was that the floor format of the restaurant was such that you had to do quite some walking around to figure out where everything was and some little signs highlighting the different sections would have helped immensel
5
We stayed in Singapore for two nights and ate at The Edge each evening. On the first occasion we didn't want the full buffet. The staff were very accommodating and said we could choose whichever meal we wanted for just $18. We both chose Peking duck with rice and this was excellent. On the second evening we had the full buffet which cost $68. Really well worth it . The whole buffet was amazing and we were unable to fault any of the courses. The restaurant staff were all very helpful and pleasant. We would definitely recommend The Edge
5
This restaurant serves multiple cuisines from different nations. I tried the Indian cuisine and found it to be of very high quality. The breakfast spread is extremely wide and so is the dessert spread for lunch. The service is also in line with the strong brand that the hotel commands.

Edge Coaster - Fun!
Sky walk - Just Normal
I recommend to get the package of 2 rides Edge Coaster for only P600
5
great selection of food and all very nice. visited here twice and if you are a guest of the hotel you receive a discount.
5
Love the restaurant for the big and tasty buffets. They have alot of different stations here which prepare different kind of food for you as you want it. Prices are normal for this kind of food.
4
Well done Edge. You outshine the rest of the Sunday brunches from a service, variety, value and atmosphere perspective.
Have enjoyed brunch a few times with patrons ranging from 8 to 58. All of us were consistently happy.
Keep it up.
5
This buffet is excellent. Go at 9 pm and it is discounted. The food is fresh, excellent selection from all over the region. The meats are great and it tastes very high quality. The ambiance is also top. My favorite is the thai red curry, the Indian selections, the carvery of meats and the "to die for" cheesy chicken stew!
5
We have visited a Edge for several Sunday Brunches Buffets. Amazing selection of champagne , wine, cocktails, juices....and the food! So many different countries to choose from.. Fresh seafood to die for! Japanese, Indian, Chinese, European, charcuterie, salad.....you name it you can have it... Then there is the Dessert Smorgasboard. You will think you have died and gone to heaven!!!!!A beautiful day was complete when a small cake was brought to celebrate our daughters engagement.Perfect again!Hands down, Best Buffet in Singapore
5
Firstly, I like to thank the staff and management for a wonderful lunch. They were all gracious and attentive to our needs.My friend gave my mum a treat in EDGE. It was her birthday. The spread was too much for our tummy. Great food - and tasty. The Mexican tacos, the Mediterranean spread, the Northern Indian dishes were too much for us to take in, but as usual we wanted to try all, and we ended with a very heavy stomach. What was amazing is that, at the end of it all, there is still room for wantan soup. So we went over to the noodle counter and we each had our sumptuous bowl of wantan soup which is comfortingly and fittingly stomach warming dish. The soup was piping hot, but we managed to finish it. And felt really pleased to end our meal with it. It was our perfect buffet experience. If I am invited to this place again, I will definitely say "YES" - a good place to meet and catch-up
5
This restaurant has clearly the best breakfast buffet I've ever experienced. The buffet includes choices from Europe and spans all Asian countries and breakfast delicacies. The juice bar is phenomenal and all juices are prepared on the spot using fresh fruits/vegetables. I highly recommend this place for breakfast/brunch
5
Had a wonderful time at Edge. My ultimate fave, crab legs! There are tons of menus to choose from. You've got Japanese, Indian, fresh seafood, etc.! Oh and a smorgasbord of desserts! I think I may have gone back and forth several times on this section alone.:

Located on the 3rd flr, Edge is a restaurant inside the Pan Pacific hotel. My review is based on service during breakfast hour, as breakfast was included with my stay. Similar to other hotels in Singapore catering to international travelers, edge offers diners plenty of choices during breakfast service. All stations are buffet-style, serving foods common in Europe/American (sweet pastry, croissants, baked beans, eggs, bacon & sausage, etc.), to Asia (congee, dim sum, noodles soup, fried noodles, fried rice, naan, yogurt, sushi, etc.) to deli & cheese station, fresh fruit station (pineapple, watermelon, papaya, dragon fruits). They also have a couple stations offering cook-to-order dishes, like omelettes, or fish-ball or wonton noodle soup. The servers are fairly attentive in clearing the empty plate and refilling tea or coffee. But they're not overly intrusive (i was able to enjoy my meal without being interrupted every 5 min). I think for juices, you have to full those yourself at that juice station. You gets a small orange/black card on the table that tells the staff whether you just getting more food or you're done. So you don't have to worry about someone accidentally clearing you table.As mentioned my breakfast was included with my stay, so I don't know how much breakfast is at the Edge. That said, food was good, service was good... If I have to pay out of pocket, I would prob pay around $25SGD... Simply because there are a lot of local places (e.g., hawker stands, food courts) you can find similar food for less money, though may not be at one convenient location. Or you have a huge appetite that you require buffet-style feeding. :
5
Was at edge last Sunday and can't wait to return, what an amazing brunch we had, the cooking stations are amazing, fabulous satay, curry, pasta, fois gras and amazing cheese selection, the free flow veuve clicquot just adds to the decadence... And the staff to add were just amazing and attentive.. Will return soo
5
Our group of six had a wonderful evening at Edge, arriving after 9pm we easily got a table. Excellent service, where we had a tour of the buffet options which seemed endless. We could order seafood cook to order, and then found our way through the Thai, Malaysian, seafood, satay, salad, pasta and grill tables. Wine is typically expensive, with a limited but adequate selection at $17 per glass, ice water was complimentary. Keep room for the dessert bar, including the large chocolate fondue fountain and icecream bar. Great value for the late night sitting at $50 per head, normally $78 per head. Definitely recommended
3
Revisited the restaurant on their seafood night after a very good experience on our first visit. Did not notice much difference on the food selection from the usual nights, even though it was more expensive. Disappointed that they have discontinued the liquor chocolates and champagne jelly
5
This is our second visit at Edge. Our first experience for breakfast buffet was lovely and so is dinner buffet this time. Dinner buffet is expensive but, worth spending. Huge buffet spread. More then you can ask for..Salads, Fresh pasta stations, fresh grill stations, seafood, indian, thai, Malaysian, local.. and many more.... Yumm!! Dessert spread. Nice and clean ambience. Quick service. Tasty freshly made aglio olio pasta, quality seafood, yummy desserts. Raspberry sorbet was the best. My hubby's dessert fav was..dark chocolates. We loved everything we had. But, indian food was not that impressive. Indian section for breakfast buffet is quite good. But, for dinner buffet indian section failed to impress both me and my husband. It was tasteful and exquisite experience for both, me and my husband. Highly recommend dinner buffet at Edge

Had a reunion dinner with my ex-colleagues last Tuesday at our favourite Edge restaurant. At the entrance, we were greeted by the friendliest Service Manager you could ever find in Singapore, Mr Suresh Whom also took our drinks order and made some really good recommendations. Thereafter, we were greeted by so many of your regular staff's who remembered us and our favourite drinks and dishes. Just to name a few of them who had left some deepest impressions on us. Mr Kok Chia who knew I loved the Ice Latte made by him, Jega who gave me the most beautiful and warm smile, Chee Vooi who noticed my arrival and served me a platter of sashimi bearing all my favourites.Edge is truly a restaurant that serves the greatest variety of food and has the warmest and most charming service that one can ever get. It has always been and will always be my favourite restaurant of all times
5
Excellent range of food from around the world. Our favourite was the seafood bar which included lobster, langoustine, oysters and scallops. Our other highlight was the Wagyu beef...so tender! The champagne was free flowing, we never managed to finish our glass before it was refilled! Would definitely recommend a visit
5
As we were house guests we decided to go for dinner and were lucky to get a table being a Saturday night and there were events galore in the vicinity. The buffet was excellent great selection , food was fresh and tasty and the staff provided excellent table service. The seafood , deserts, local food and Japanese sections were well patronized. Good selection of wine and best of all we got 30% off being house guests. So overall excellent will be going again soo
4
It is a wonderful place to having dinner buffet ,and I must to say that was a great one ..we were four and satisfied with the wide range of menu in its all means .. thanks for the staff to creating such a nice service .... hope to be here soon and recommend to everyone ...
5
we visited The edge for seafood buffet. The variety was plenty and there were many options, so even if u have vegetarean things, there is plenty to eat. One has so many choices to make including the cuisine as well. It was nice, service was very good. The desserts are also very nice, not much choice if you want low calorie or less sugary stuff. I am sure the staff is craetive enough, if the management wishes to include healthy options as well!
5
Having visited several of the restaurants and bars in the Pan Pacific Hotel we decided to give Edge a try. We went for brunch one weekend and it was fantastic! Thanks to its seven kitchens which included food from all over Asia such as Indian, Chinese, Thai and Malay, we were spoilt for choiceâ€¦ and the free-flow champagne made it all go down easy! I tried a bit of food from every station, including sushi, Pork Belly and of course the amazing dessert station
5
Enjoyed both the breakfast and the dinner buffets and they were fantastic. Great service, amazing variety, everything was wonderful.
4
We had breakfast at the restaurant and I must say it's one of the best breakfast buffets we've tried so far. The variety is huge and delicious.
5
Our great thanks to all of the staff at EDGE. You made the celebratory lunch on Sun 10th August for our daughters' engagement so very special! The happy couple were very pampered, and loved the food, ambience...and especially their Congratulatory cake!My husband & I had visited before, which is why we came again... You have the best Brunch we have ever had...worldwide! We will definitely be back

As a tourist staying at pan pacific, I have tried its dinner & breakfast buffet.The spread of food is good and so is the food quality. Impressive ones include the oysters, cheese, satay, spaghetti station, Malay desserts, pizzas, freshly squeezed sugar cane juice at breakfast....great view of the flyer, comfortable booth seats....I, however, do not find the buffet exceptional due to the following:1) food quality fluctuates from morning to morning and we just cant believe that it's the same restaurant we are visiting: tasteless sugar cane juice in one morning, very bad dim sum, watery congee....2) rice at the Japanese food counter certainly not cooked with Japanese rice3) very limited choice of sashimi 4) tasteless crab legs, what a disappointment! 5) limited choice of seafood & fruit6) bread quality so-so, cake choice, again, limited7) soup choice also limited (wanna get some Chinese soup for our sick child, can't find any)8) service of some junior waiters was terrible. Slow, not responsive... Can never get a cup of coffee at breakfast if we don't ask for it. we placed an order at the satay counter, never got it! The first time that an order will be missed in a so-called "good" buffet. At the buffet of four seasons Macau, our faces were recognized and the food were brought to us even if we had not given any stick bearing our table no. to the Wagyu cooking station.there are better buffets elsewhere in HK, Macau & Dubai or even in Malaysia. Inevitably we are somehow dusappointed after reading so many good reviews stating that "it's the best buffet ever". To conclude, good quality, price reasonable for what we've got but certainly not the best buffet ever
5
With an incredible spread of italian, chinese, western, indian, thai, japanese and others, this buffet is hands down one of the best, if not the best I've had.Not to be missed1) Homemade sausages (grilled to order, the crunchy pop of the skins is evidence of its goodness)2) Snow crab legs. (located in the cold seafood section, the crab legs are sweet and succulent)3) Tom Yum Soup ( great flavour and a must try)4) Singapore Laksa (rivals the more famed laksa places in singapore)5) Salt - Pepper Lamb Rib ( this one is done occasionally and is extremely delicious and tender)6) The desserts section ( an incredible spread with an entire section devoted to sweets, the home made chocolates are really really good - similar to royce chocolates
5
The Edge offers the most variety for breakfast. Having been to many other luxury hotels, I have not seen such a wide spread for breakfast. Come in here early because there's usually a long line by 930am.
5
Although I was kind of reluctant at first to go to this Brunch (it cost us SGD 135 per person, with a discount), it turned out to be the best brunch I have been to so far. The variety of food was amazing. The buffet was massive. Everything could be found: from an outstanding quality Iberian Ham (that I am only able to eat when I go to Spain) to a pasta station where they were preparing duck ravioli with mushroom sauce. The meat station, where all kind of pork, duck and beef cuts were prepared a la minute. Another highlight was the foie gras station where fresh duck liver was prepared with an amazing tangerine sauce, and the sucking piglet station, where it was served very crispy. Even the dessert station was to die for. The cocktails served could not have been better, and there was a free flow of alcoholic beverages for 4 hours. Only the best champagne was served. I would go back again a hundred times. Every dollar spent was completely worth it

After eating in some of the more stylish and well known Singapore eateries, as well as some of he less known ones, we are not naturally the Buffet types..... this has swayed us. No-One does this as well as Singapore - Hungry? They have what you want. From memory, over 7 stations of international delights. Wagyu Beef, Pork Belly, Ribs and Lamb for the carnivores, Sashimi, sushi, str fry's, grills, fresh and cooked seafood, stews, salads, 1 massive desert station..... i could go on. It gets busy, so the service can get a little slowish for drinks and specials, but its a popular place. Veuve as the house champas, as well as an extensive beer and wine list leaves you well hydrated. We missed it, but the Sunday brunch from 12-4pm with unlimited Veuve, is apparently an event within itself.My highlight was the perfectly cooked Wagyu fillet and the fatty and silky smooth tuna sashimi. Or maybe the desert bar....cant remember...in a food coma....The View is also quite breathtaking, even though you are only on the 4th floor. The Pan Pacific is an architectural wonder, so spend a little time resting in the foyer.Biggest Tip - Don't eat all day until you get there...

The consistent theme from almost every station is at this sizeable buffet - poor quality ingredients.Sashimi had been frozen and was watery and tasteless. The "swordfish" was definitely not swordfish. The prawns and scalops were similarly rendered tastless; probably through uneducated freezing techniques.The very limited meat selection was terrible quality - thin, dry, badly cooked. The pizzas could have come directly from a supermarket box in the "bargain" section.There were only two items that were good. An excellent vegetable gratin and a reasonable selection of cheeses.Service and ambience are good.At +-SGD90 per person (inclusive), it's definitely not worth the visit. Avoid

The buffet at Edge surpasses many other buffets that I have been to at 5 star hotels in Singapore. The service is attentive and professional. The range and quality of food is astounding. The difference here is that you can place your order for a range of dishes and the chef's at the different cooking stations will individually prepare your meal. This restaurant would cater for even the most fussy of eaters and it would take pages to list all the different possibilities here. A great place to dine

We were looking forward to this as a really good buffet experience. However this was so disappointing. The food was all luke warm - I am sure the curries may have been nice but not served luke warm. The sashimi was good, deserts uninspiring....The night we went was their advertised meats special the meat was fatty and cold.No service really. So not worth i

Been searching high and low for anniversary dinner celebration with my love one. Decided to try Edge by reading at their high recommendation reviews in TA. Neverless the reviews did not failed me. Their service is superb and fast in clearing our palates. Food are replenish fast enough. Food choices are great. This place is great for dessert lovers. Their cakes is nice. Would definitely recommend this place to my loved one! and most importantly, my husband enjoyed the buffet very much. Thank you Edge
5
Excellent meal with pleasant staff dressed well, especially the waitress of the name Rachel, who is Korean I guess... She is very polite and friendly and always greets with a smile. The food is very delicious too, with various cuisines to choose from. The station I liked best was the 'Teh Tarik' one because they made you fresh milk tea with foamy bubbles on top, on the spot itself! :
5
Staying in the Pan Pacific, I had breakfast and dinner buffet at the Edge. Both are very good. Breakfast buffet offers Western, Chinese, Malay, Japanese and Indian choices. They seem to offer ice-cream as well which is quite unique for breakfast buffets I guess.Dinner is even better in terms of choice. Fresh oysters are good
3
The laksa was pretty awesome, but don't ask for counter table if you have children, they do not provide high baby chair and it's a nightmare trying to feed your child who is crying her head off as she's 1 metre below you

Today was my second dining experience at Edge in Pan Pacific Hotel. After trying their Seafood themed dinner a few weeks ago, and had one of the best experiences thus far in Singapore, one of their staff sold me the idea to go and try their Sunday Champagne brunch, so I dragged a few friends who are big fans of brunches around town. It was hard to convince them as their top choices have always been either the Hyatt or Capella (for the beach mode). However, you guys at Edge made me proud as everyone hasn't stopped talking about how outstanding this brunch was, Amazing spread, marvelous colors everywhere, outstanding service and a few gentlemen in suits walking around making sure everyone of your busy restaurant is fully satisfied and taken care of. And let's not forget that we never felt rushed, after all a 4-hour affair of all you can eat and drink (Veuve Cliquot) is just the best deal ever.Thank you Edge and Pan Pacific, you've done us happy

Had dinner buffet here last Friday with my husband. Was a good buffet spread from Asian to western food. Service was also good! For the price we paid total bill sgd 165 ( there was UOB credit card discount which was awesome). Highly recommend!
4
Our family went for dinner on a weekday. This is one of the best buffet in town.The food sections are spread out in the very spacious restaurant. Service staffs were very attentive and efficient. Food variety was huge. There will be something for everyone. Just make sure you go with an empty stomach, and leave space for the desserts. They have very good chocolates with alcohol. Great value especially with the current credit cards promotion (1 dine free with every 3 paying adults)
5
Easily one of the best Sunday brunch spreads I've been to and at $158++ with free flow champagne, it was worth it. There are more than 12 live counters searing fresh seafood, roast meats, Asian cuisine, and a great selection of cheeses. Just the seafood section was worth the price alone with its Alaskan King Crab, Boston Lobster, giant tiger prawns and oysters from France. Service was attentive and polite, and the champagne kept coming all the way till 4pm. Highly recommended
5
The buffet spread is amazing. I came back to the hotel just for the buffet. It caters to many cuisines and features Live Kitchens which were great. Service staff is still great but food was exceptional
5
my friends and myself had brunch yesterday in the edge.buffet and life cooking station are just amazing.even a grill station they over where they do fresh lamb chops,waguy beef and all kind of sausages.service team lead by the very friendly and professional manager Reynan is always attentive and helpful.great job pan pacific team.i will be back soon.wo

My wife treated me for my birthday at Edge. From sashimi to indian section, the food display are very well organized. There are sections which are chef-served. Just choose what you like to eat from the counter and they will be served to your table.There are find many varieties from fresh sea food, chinese-style and Indian-style cooked food to dessert - everything is nice, fresh and well cooked. Service wise - the staff are attentive to your needs.Perfect place for a nice and relaxing dinner. I will definitely recommend any people looking for buffet to try the food here and will come with my friends again
5
I am writing to let you know how much I appreciate the outstanding customer service that your staff provided last week. I visited edge for brunch. Your staff was very attentive and helpful. The staff I interacted with, especially irish, was very knowledgeable about your buffet line and she always have that pretty smile. If i were her boyfriend I will be proud of her. It was my first time to dine at edge and it's true the wide variety of exquisite food, lavish drinks and our overall dining experience was absolutely amazing. Thank you to the kitchen staff who are on duty on that day superb food

Had a feast at night. Found that the fish wasn't that fresh (especially the mekajiki or swordfish) and MSG was added in real lot (felt really thirsty after leaving. Drank several mugs of water but to no avail). However, I have to applaud their excellent service and there were lots of variety. The pork belly was supreme. Champagne (Veuve Clicquot) was fantastic
4
We came to this restaurant for Mother's Day lunch. The service was impeccable from the moment we arrived at the front desk. Tables and seating was spacious and stylish. I was a tad apprehensive when I saw the Japanese station did not serve sashimi, but that was soon forgotten when I found I was spoilt for choice... Worth a second round of servings are the satay, "rojak", roast meat and the durian fudge cake and penyat / paste. You can order frothy teh tarik (stretched tea) and they serve it to your table too. Cost of the buffet was not unreasonable which made it all the more worthwhile
5
Situated in the Pan Pacific hotel, theres a great buffet with 6 stations where they make all kind of food. Tasty, fresh, clean, great view of skyline..and not really expensive. Worth a try, you wont get disappointed
5
We've been to the regular Saturday lunch buffet before and enjoyed it a lot. We recently tried out their new Sunday Champagne Brunch....longest Sunday brunch in Singapore and we definitely made use of it! I think we left around 4:30 p.m. and never felt rushed out the door. They simply started to tidy up around us and prepare for dinner but the remaining few tables of diners were left to wrap up their meals and digest.The food was delicious. I didn't try all the stations but focused more on the things that I really liked. Seafood for starters. I filled up on plenty of oysters, crab legs, lobster and champagne of course! They kept us topped up. Also, the truffled duck ravioli was divine. The cheese board was impressive and the wagyu beef at the grill was melt in your mouth. Unfortunately I was quite full by the time I made it round to the grill so I could only eat a small piece. Next time! And of course all the other buffet foods you would expect were all appealing and plentiful - Indian food, satays, breakfast food, Asian dishes, noodle soup, sushi, etc. The sticky mango rice was another favourite of mine. The dessert area looked good and I think it was pretty much the same as their standard dessert buffet selection but I couldn't fit much in towards the end. The few samples I did try were tasty and went well with the Latte that I made myself drink….had to wrap up the brunch experience properly. Honestly, 4 hours is the perfect amount of time to sip, graze and relax. It was a great move on Pan Pacific's part to extend their brunch just that little bit longer to make it that much more enjoyable. Great brunch and look forward to going back
5
Great range of food choices, intact too much if you are like me and very indecisive!! We stayed at the hotel so visited here a couple of times for evening meals and everyday for breakfast! The breakfast is fantastic and so much choice!! The evening meals are just the same, lots of live cooking stations to choice from, chicken rice, dim sum, grill with lots of sausages and seafood on the seafood night, pasta, meat carving, salads, sushi, LOTS to choice from and very high quality
5
They have so many different stations to go to Japanese chinese Korean English and just western we really loved the night smorgasbord was great thank

On the 15th May 2014, that was the night I celebrated my 21st birthday at Pan Pacific, Edge.I am the type of person who loves international buffet so much! But on that day, I was 10 times more hyper and energetic over the buffet menu which Edge offered me! It is seafood buffet night!!!! <3 The Alaska crab, the oyster, the freshly baked scallop, the white pepper well marinated cray fish, the chili crabs, the salted baked salmon! THEY ARE SOO NICE!!! Until the 21st teenager like me have forgotten to take a snap of every food I had.Moreover, besides the great food i had, I love the place- the interior design of the restaurant. On my left side of my place where my friends and i were seated, I could clearly see the beautiful Singapore flyer! I definitely love these combination- GOOD FOOD + GOOD VIEW !What's more could i ask?OH!!! one last thing that I want mentioned so badly!!!The service! The staffs there took part a part in my birthday surprise! They are always there to answer all my queries. A warm smile was reflected on everyone of them!Such a beautiful dinner i ever had <3Hence, I highly recommend Edge to everybody!!! They offer a great menu ! a great international buffet! They have variety of cuisine including western, Indian, japanese, chinese, thai and many more!!! <3It is great place to host many events there example, birthday dinners, anniversary dinner, a quick get together with friends, and many many more!! :D You definitely MUST try it ! And I, will SURELY AND CERTAINLY COME BACK MORE OFTEN for the meat buffet, a long long brunch , and the lovely SUNDAY BRUNCH <3 YEAH!!!!Anyway !! hope to see you guys around the restaurant <3 #BUFFETLOVER <3-meycon

Perhaps the widest range of choice I have seen in Singapore for a buffet and pretty much all of it excellent. In particular the laksa is excellent! The Edge is a nicely designed restaurant in the Pan Pacific hotel. There a small cubicles for more intimate dining as well as long tables for groups. The food is regularly replenishe
5
Just went with wife and kids for a Mothers' Day lunch, courtesy of Symphony 924, my favourite radio station. Excellent food, very pleasant staff, we had a great time (too many marshmallows, though) and will certainly come again
5
I highly recommend this for business meetings and gatherings. The food selections are variety and delicious. They offer western cuisines and asian delicacies from Thailand , Indian , Malaysian and Singapore. What I love the most is their seafood sections and by every 10 to 15 mins they topup cray fishes on the pot. The desert selections are wonderful. They have gelato , sorbet and ice cream and pana cota as well. Cakes and floating chocolates are not to miss. The ambience are nice and the staff service is great
5
I had breakfast buffet in 'Edge' during our stay.Breakfast buffet, was huge. So many things to choose, from local delicacies to western cuisines and Indian as well. Variety of breads. Jams, cereals, yogurts, Fresh juices and fresh coffee, Egg station (you can customize your omelette), Fresh hot pancakes and waffles.Thumbs up!!! for not just quantity but, for quality and taste as well
5
This was by far the best buffet I have seen. There was plenty of choice and all food was of a high quality. The best part was live cooking stations were it was great to watch the food being prepared by the chef's including the freshly made pasta. The dessert area was more like a piece of art work in how it was presented. Also, the service by all staff was exceptional, from the chefs and waitstaff. I would definitely recommend brunch at Edge
5
I would call myself as a "Foodie" but what I've seen on the Easter Sunday Brunch was more than I've ever expected!It was a mixture of awesome food, - and of course lots of champagne and wine. Where should I begin? I had one of the best sashimis I've ever tried, great Iberico ham, Foie Gras (yummy), duck filled ravioli in truffle sauce (highlight) and plenty of good cheese (especially with truffle honey) and lots of cake(s)! Go for the cheesecake and the brownie (although it was gluten free). They also serve excellent wines. Service is outstanding (and yes I mean every single person). We will definitely come back again.
5
We ate the buffet here...they call it restaurant theatre as there are seven different stations. All are very different and the choice is enormous. Leave room for the excellent cheese selection and leave even more for the desserts!
4
We've been here for celebrating a family event and we have appreciated the very big choice of asian foods an more. We were welcomed by champagne and it turned out to be a free flow for 26SGD each. The food was almost all very good, we liked among the others the very high choice of cheese and meat. Also sweets and fruit are very good. The staff is nice and the service is very good. Probably we missed more info about the possible allergenic included in the various preparation. Also the list of wines is not very wide.We recommend this place
5
I stayed in Pan Pacific for 3 nights with my husband. We enjoyed our stay very much.The room that we stayed has a fantastic view. I love the amenities, the bed, rest room, staff and the ambiance. I couldn't ask for more.The hotel is situated in the heart of Singapore, whereby if you wish to go for a quick shopping there is an access in marina square mall and suntec city mall.What I am amazed is all the F&B outlet served delicious food and they have a friendly and knowledgeable staff, we went almost all the outlet, we love the food very much, but my favorite was Edge Restaurant.I have been to many 5 star buffet in Singapore Edge is the best we can find in town. The spread of buffet is very huge, the food is fresh, the design of the restaurant is very unique, the staff are well trained and professional. There is a staff named David I guess he is the operation manager he was so accommodating and knowledgeable. He was making all the guest feel home and giving us the best time while we are having our breakfast and dinner there . We will definitely come back to pan pacific for the great hospitality that we truly enjoyed
5
An unexpected feast, quite possibly the best brunch ever. The choice of food/dishes was exceptional and we loved the seafood. The Boston lobsters, Oysters from Bordeaux......everything was exceptional. The Malsian dishes were delicious, the rice and noodle selection was perfect.....will have to go again to try everything we missed. The service was impeccable. Well done
4
Went there for dinner last Dec. The variety was fantastic. The quality of food was top notch as alot of the food was cooked upon order. Desserts were amazing. I loved the Indian food especially. The ambiance was classy too. Many seats are available yet they are well spaced. I have been to many hotel buffets in SG and consider this my favorite, way better than alot of overhyped places such as The Line
5
Edge never fail in terms of service & selection of food. There was so many food sections from Jap, Indian, Chinese, Indonesian, Western & BBQ stn. . And the desert selection is a must for everyone to try, mini cakes to ice cream to nonya cakes
5
So many cuisines to choose from. All freshly prepared at the many food prep stations. Yummy. Only had breakfast here, the food was very good and the furnishings were very comfortable.
5
This is a brilliant restaurant with a huge selection of food. Staff are fantastic and very fast. The food is excellent and is much better than your big hotel Las Vegas Buffet.A great experience and well worth a visit
5
Went for Sunday brunch. You need to book. Two packages available - food or champagne and food. We took the food package. Yes, it is OMG good. Take your camera for the desert bar which is spectacular and would delight any child (and lots of big kids too). There are many counters - seafood, salad, Japanese, Indian, Malaysian and Italian plus the Sunday roast and a Chinese duck complete with the cooked hanging ducks. It was spectacular food and spectacularly displayed.So book, get there at noon and take your time for a food experience you will think about for a long time

"And if I knew I was going to die tomorrow, Edge is where I would have one last splendid meal ere I meet my maker."For buffet cognoscenti, deciding which restaurant to head to is like making Sophie’s Choice. Those that offer a cornucopia usually disappoint with their insipid mainstays. Those that do dole out delightful cuisines like to limit our choices —there are only so many times I can surfeit on olives, my dear restaurateurs.So it is a pleasant surprise that Edge at Pan Pacific bucks this trend and instead fêtes its guests with a smorgasbord of mouthwatering dishes. Edge is marketed as a ‘food theatre’ and rightly so. The menu is an impressive pastiche of beloved Chinese, Malay, Singaporean, Thai, Indian and Japanese cuisines. A bevy of affable chefs presides over seven open counters, ever eager to satisfy your hankerings.The restaurant is stately without being awash in pretentiousness. Columns of luxurious couches hug the entrance —how much did I want to plunk onto one right after the indulgence? The main dining area is dimly lit, making it an ideal address for some romance or tête-à-têtes. This is in stark juxtaposition with how the kitchen is set up. Bright lights glint off the array of cuisines, making them the focal points.Read more: http://aldenboon.com/bon-vivant-on-the-lamb/2014/3/9/live-life-on-the-edg

If you only have one meal in Singapore, make it the Sunday brunch at The Edge, based in the Pan Pacific Hotel. You can eat food from the whole of Asia and beyond, then wash it down with a glass of Veuve Cliquot that magically refills itself all afternoon. Most of the food is cooked before your eyes, and the sweet counter is to die for!
5
Stayed in Pan Pacific for 5 days and started my day with the most lavish breakfast spread have ever relished in my life! Tried my best but couldn't manage to taste everything on the counters :( Thai..Chinese...Japanese...Vietnamese..Malaysian...Indonesian...covers the entire Asia-Pacific culinary world on the menu! Had never experimented so much with food...loved the live counters for khowsuey (try the ones with fish balls), the visually appealing & palpably delighting Sushi varieties, sea food platters. And if at all you miss desi food...idli...vada...poha..upma..poor bhaji waits for you
4
On Sunday I enjoyed here the most wonderful Champagne Brunch. Flavors and tastes from all over the world served on an array of chef-staffed buffets. All food is fresh, tasty and a very helpful and friendly staff is taking good care of you. And pouring unlimited Veuve Clicquot! I can't remember ever saying "stop, thank you, that will be enough" to more Veuve before..
4
Consistent, fantastic spread, great taste, great value. Fresh seafood (though seafood spread could have been a little broader :) ), gorgeous dessert spread - love it that they have gluten-free foods! 
4
I ate my breakfast here every morning. There are many different good stations around the restaurant, Western, Asian, Japanese etc. the good was excellent as was the service. Recommended.
4
Very good place to tuck into a widepsread of buffet. Freshly shucked oysters amongst one of the best in the selection of international buffet. Table service can be better though. Overall experience was good.
3
Very nice setting but the dinner food was only average. Staff attendance and service was slow for drinks and such. Overall the dinner was overpriced.
5
Did Xmas brunch at the edge and what can i say other than amazing. We started in the bar below sipping on Mumm's Champagne and Cloudy bay wines. As we were a large group with children we received a private area with doors we could close. The staff were fantastic and always fast with any requests. A choice of over 5 imported beers was great as many brunches just serve the local beer. The food choices were endless from sushi to lobster to noodles and roast meats. To finish off the deserts station was over the top with some of the best ice cream i have had. I now recommend anyone in Singapore for xmas to do the Edge buffet
5
Like what trip advisor asked, this is one of the best meals I've ever had in a restaurant. Was here in 2013 (less than half a year ago) for my boyfriend's ORD 'party', it was a significant occasion for us as it was the closure of a difficult chapter in his life and our relationship. I brought him to the Edge on a friday night with a reservation, didn't really like the table and staff were happy to move us somewhere else. the staff were very attentive and pleasant, we got a tour of the buffet before we sat down so we knew where the different stations were. The spread of food is amazing, fantastic, beautiful there's not enough words to describe this buffet! I could write in length all of the food we tried but that would take a while, we arrived at 8pm and didn't leave until after 11pm, the staff didn't try to chase us out although we knew they were closing soon. Great selection of teas and the staff at the station helped me choose one perfect to my tastes. It was impossible to try all the food because after trying one thing, I just wanted to keep eating it because it was so good! Great system of using sticks with your table number on them to give to the station staff so you don't have to wait for your food right there, you can explore the buffet or go back to your seat and they will bring the food right to you.The restaurant had a great, relaxing ambience, it was not too busy and the lighting was perfect for a romantic dinner. Although the buffet is a little pricy, i would say that it is definitely worth it. Don't eat lunch if you're planning on going to the Edge! you'll be able to eat enough for a whole day ;)Overall i had an amazing experience at The Edge and I will definitely come back
5
We went here with a bunch of friends on Xmas eve for a champagne buffet dinner. The food was incredible from the variety of cheeses to sushi to oysters to lobsters to Indian food to the desserts. Oh yea, the champagne was good too!If you're looking for a champagne brunch, go here - you won't regret it! My only negative comment would be the buffet closed an hour earlier than what we were told when we phoned in. Make sure you confirm closing on arrival as you do want to get your monies' worth
5
Amazingly one of the best buffet spread in hotels.Buffets are usually ignored by most. However Edge is different.It is like walking into a huge well designed, well built both with hard and software shopping centre.The action stations , hot. cold, oriental, Western,Japanese, Thai and event deserts have good chefs and cooks stationed .It has sufficient space for walking and selecting with friendly waitresses and waiter even cooks engaged in conversations to assists the curious diners.I would return with more families and friends very soon
4
Booked 2nd sitting for their Christmas lunch and arrived a bit early like several others.Seating available in Atrium area and offered a glass of Champagne (included as free flow with lunch) which was a nice touch.Serving stations were only just re-stocking from 1st sitting as we were shown to our table.Good ambience with carol singers at the entrance and festivally decorated.Food was varied & of good quality, plenty of seafood on ice, some local favourites such as char siew rice.Turkeys carved to order as was gammon. Couldn't find any stuffing & the roast potatoes ran out (frustrating for those who wanted a traditional English Xmas dinner).As mentioned above, Champagne flowed freely all through lunch, but although offered cocktails & mocktails, it was hit and miss as to whether they arrived.Very expensive at SGD 159++ however it was in linw with other top end hotel Christmas lunches.Worth considering should you find yourself in Singapore for Christmas 2014
5
As mentioned in my review of the hotel, I was a solo traveller for my first three days in Singapore, staying at Pan Pacific, and Edge was perfect for my needs. A wide range of excellent food, I could order exactly to suit myself, and set my own pace for dinner. When I'm dining alone, I hate waiting for a slow procession of waiter service, so the concept of a buffet with freshly cooked food was perfect. The restaurant also functions well for groups, with a fixed price, and for families, when children can eat what pleases them in suitable quantities. A few nights later, after my husband had arrived in Singapore, we walked past Makansutra, and were so pleased that we didn't have to dine there in the heat and fluorescent glare. We could get similar dishes at Edge, we were cool and in a comfortable environment. Comes at a price, but that's only to be expected
3
We went there because of Tripadvisor reviews....and were mostly unimpressed. The decor is nice the staff is so-so...and quantity doesn't necessarily mean quality. Most disappointed with the "sushi" . It would be an insult to the Japanese culinary culture to call THAT STUFF sushi or sashimi. The "chef" was a Chinese boy who obviously never had any formal training....his idea sashimi was just to slice up the fish any way he could and slop it on a plate....Presto! and smiling as if he thought he had done a good job. The rice was gooey...the whole thing was a mess. The fresh oysters were delicious and the boiled shrimp was good too. The meat was overcooked. and the other dishes were uninpired. The pizza was greasy and limp. Many dishes were cold. There was a Yank teaching the pasta guy how to prepare a dish....if you have to learn how to cook Italian food from a Yank you should give up.....Considering the price of about $70 USD per person this wasn't a BAD deal but it was no great bargain. Overall it was just a very large C class buffet. This place might please some people...who prefer quantity to quality. There was a family of 150 plus KG folks working themselves into a feeding frenzy...wasn't a pretty sight
4
Whatever you would like for breakfast you will it here, just be aware you will probably need to wait get an egg cooked
5
The buffet breakfast at the Edge restaurant at the Pan Pacific, Singapore, was the best buffet I have ever been to. The choice of food is incredible - juice bar, Indian, cereal, fruit, Chinese, European, pancakes, muffins etc etc etc. Unbelievably good!
5
Remarkable selection/choice for breakfast. Food in some cases could have been a bit hotter. If you want a choice of traditional breakfast fare it there, plus an array of Asian, Sushi, and you name it for breakfast.
4
While staying at the Pan Pacific Singapore, I ate breakfast every day. They have a good variety for the different tastes.
5
Decided to bank on their weekday 1-for-1 lunch buffet promotion and dined with my family. Online reservation was fuss free and I made a follow up call to the reservations hotline to confirm as I did not receive any email confirmation. The lady who picked up the call was a tad unprofessional. I mentioned I'd like to double check my reservation and amend it from 5to4 pax. She replied 'for what?' Which took me off guard. Anyway, we were seated in a lovely spacious corner of the restaurant which was great as we had a baby in pram. The variety of food available was amazing and I must especially commend on the Indian and Malay food. Very authentic and flavourful and we all loved it. Japanese sashimi was fresh and generously portioned out. Remember to leave space for dessert or you'll be sorry for missing out on quality chocolates, ice cream, waffles/pancakes and durian pengat. Highly recommended even for full price (non 1-for-1) and would definitely visit again
5
I write this review whilst having coffee in a wonderful restaurant. The Edge is truly exceptional. From the moment you are greeted by the staff you know you are in for a treat. There are a number of stations offering diiferent styles of cuisine from western to Chinese , Malay, Indian, Japanese. All the food is freshly prepared and well presented - it all adds a new dimension to "a buffet" it truly deserves a five star rating. From choice to presentation to flavours. I will definitely be dining here again and soon. Wether on your own or as a couple or group it is a lovely dining experience
5
I visited the restaurant during dinner, they had the widest spread I had ever seen: Alaska crabs, oysters, tiger prawns, scallops, chilli crabs, black pepper crabs, Japanese sushi, sashimi, Thai corner, India corner, Chinese corner,Malay corner, Singaporean local food corner, international corner, pasta station, fresh grilled meats, fresh fruits, etc, etc. The restaurant has open kitchen concept and most of the food are freshly prepared. One will be easily overwhelmed by the quantity and quality of food. The buffet cost S$68 plus 17pct, good value
5
Went with friends to the Edge and what a fantastic dining experience. There are numerous food stations with all types of food for you to taste and enjoy. You just have to pace yourself and leave room at the end of your meal for the great deserts and cheeses on offer. Would definately recommend a visit here
5
I've stayed at the Pan Pacific twice, once in 2011, once in 2012. Booked a third time in November this year (2013). First visit was truly memorable, from the concierge who had my luggage in my room almost before I'd paid the taxi. Checking in was so quick and easy, and I was upgraded - late check out? Certainly, no cost! Hi Tien restaurant was a great experience, enhanced by being on the top floor of the hotel. But my highlight was the staff in the Edge restaurant. Even when being very busy they still had time to make you feel at home, that you were a personal friend almost. All kept together by the unflappable Janice.2012 things weren't so hot. Concierge was non existent - I had to carry my own luggage. Check in made me feel I as if I was in the way. Hi Tien is now just above the foyer so can be noisy. But Janice and her staff were just as before, in fact this is probably the over riding reason I haven't changed to another hotel for this visit to Singapore
4
We visited here not long after the refurbishment. We sat by the window and enjoyed the outside space as well as the inside space. The experience was really good. Watching the chefs cook for you and the wide range of cuisines. I think we tried most! I would say I thought it was a little expensive, and when you add wine on top of the meal it does add up
4
Lavish Spread, Fresh juices counter serves unique Items like Sugarcane juice. Indian Vegetarian food corner is interesting

This restaurant is more like a five star food court. Chinese, Japanese, Malay, Western, and every other conceivable cuisine. Food quality is magnificent. Truly an experience every traveler to this city should try
5
If you can't find something that you like here, then you don't deserve to travel. I particularly liked the chef that made fresh omelettes to order. Every morning I would leave it to him and he would come up with something amazing.

The next day I was sick on the plane, the only meal we had eating the day before was at this restaurant considering food poisoning can take up to 24 hours. And we had not eating the day before. It's Shame as the choice looked good, but such a large selection as they had you have to wonder how can it be fresh as the restaurant was not busy. I certainly won't return to thus restaurant again there are far better restaurant in Singapor

We have spent a couple of lazy Sunday lunch times here. The food is very good and the selection excellent. At one point though all of the stations seemed to be void of food and we had to wait .... plan your trips to the buffet to arrive off peak! Service is excellent and on both occasions we left feeling that we would definitely come back

I am grossly disappointed about the international buffet at the Edge restaurant. I went there with a couple of friends yesterday and they gave us "the only table left" when the half the restaurant was empty. When I was at the Thai food self-service station, a man came over "to help" and gave a world war 2 portion of tom yam soup - 1/3 of the bowl was filled with soup and ingredients together. Even after requesting for more coriander like a scene from Olivier Twist "Please Sir, Can I have some more?", I was given a paltry amount of green stuff on my soup. (At hawker centres, some hawkers may provide more veg when you ask) Several food stations such as the sushi bar, chicken rice station were not replenished adequately enough. The variety of stale cheese was overwhelming - I would rather settle for quality than quantity. The pizza slices were more like wafer biscuits, thin and unsatisfying. If this was a $30 buffet, it would be perfectly expected. However, this is totally unbecoming of a five-star hotel which charges $78++ per person before service charge and taxes
5
This is the one place I would return over and over again for a good sumptuous buffet. The place is spacious and ambience for dinning is comfortable. Food served are fresh and delicious. My favourite part of the buffet is the barbeque sausages, Thai, Western, Japanese, Italian, sashimi and Seafood on Ice counter with sweet Alaskan Snow Crab and fresh shelled scallop. There are prawn and fish cracker for titbits too. Desserts are good with wide range of variety
5
For a buffet restaurant this has to go down as the best I have ever been too. We visited this restaurant with friends and family and none of us were disapointed. Its well priced and has just about something for everyone. The stand out dish for me was a delicious paneer mutter.. I will definitely return to this restaurant on my next visit to Singapore!

We went to a Saturday lunch buffet as a party of 5. The restaurant is spacious and comfortable. The tables were spread out with lots of room to move around which isn't always the case at buffets. The view was lovely as well. We were all pleased with the food and selection. I made it to all the stations except for 2. The oysters were fresh and sweet and the desserts were delicious. We will definitely be going back, hopefully for dinner or Sunday brunch
5
This is a must !!Edge displayed one of the best Sunday Brunches we have ever experienced. With fresh mouthwatering Seafood & Champagne what more could you ask for ??Yes there was plenty of other food options available for those who don't eat seafood. The food, service, atmosphere was outstanding. When we return to Singapore this would have to be on our list to return, another great experience. Thank You Edge !
5
The best buffet breakfast i've went too. They have all kind of different cuisines, all kind of fresh juices and drinks are included with the buffet price and you can order as many as you like.
4
Italian n chinese very good, but Indian food quality needs to be improved.
It was not as expected, was lacking taste n spice and less of options.
5
We used the Edge restaurant each morning on our honeymoon while staying at the Pan Pacific. You will never go hungry here! 8 different stations serving such diverse, fresh and different foods.
The food set us up to last through until the evening. Amazing.
5
Huge selection of food with a great standard of quality given the numbers that pass through this huge establishment. I would most definitely recommend it.
5
Breakfast here is one of the best available in hotels across Singapore - they cover just about anything you could possibly want. The Asian options are excellent - particularly the noodle soups.Also had the buffet dinner - again excellent - with Asia choices the best in my opinion. Good value too - you get a discount if you are a guest at the hotel
5
Very impressive buffet breakfast with so much variety to choose from. You have a range of everything from fresh juices, pastries, sweets to a large selection of western and asian cuisine. We were promptly seated each morning without long wait times and the staff were also very attentive and continuously topping up our teas. This is one of the best buffet breakfasts we've had and it was something we looked forward to each morning
5
Breakfast at Edge was included in our hotel package and that turned our stay at the Pan Pacific from 'just a luxury hotel' to 'something special.' I'm sure it's an expensive breakfast if you had to pay, given the range of luxury foods on offer but when you don't have to pay extra it's a great treat.We took it slowly and spent at least an hour a day over breakfast which was a great way to start the day, especially when you're jet-lagged and awake at 6am, with nothing much open in Singapore until 10am. They had a juice bar, fresh waffles, ice-cream with a range of toppings for the kids and breakfast foods from all over the world. This probably isn't a complete list but I saw Thai, Indian, Indonesian, dim sum, Japanese and Indonesian. in the Western section they offered eggs, corned beef, roesti, sausages and a big selection of breads. The only thing that wasn't quite up to scratch was the bacon, which was a bit old/rancid tasting. The only food I didn't see was the pretzels that sometimes appear on a German breakfast buffet.Service was excellent with free flowing cappuccinos or other coffee and quick removal of plates. Staff also seemed to go out of their way to keep an eye on young families, even scooping up a runaway toddler and bringing him back to his family in a very friendly and kind way
5
Very impressive breakfast buffet. There is so much choice. Different stations of food from all over the world. Something for everyone. I was most impressed when I gave my name on arrival, the attendant knew I required gluten free, And the restaurant was packed. Here was a very short wait time to be seated during the week with a longer wait on weekends.
4
Had breakfast at the Edge over two mornings during my stay, and have to admit that the food is generally of a good quality, and with a wide selection. Only complaint is the service, which can take awhile (my latte took awhile to arrive; got it myself from the barista the next morning).Overall, it was a hearty breakfast to fuel you through the day. But don't expect everything to be perfect. It won't be.Tip: Come before 930am if you want to avoid the long queues that can form.

I went to the buffet lunch at the Edge with a colleague who lives in Singapore so she made a reservation but it wasn't full when we arrived or till we left. Hostess was very welcoming, service throughout our meal was efficient and friendly. The spread was very well presented, similar concept but smaller than The Line at the Shangri-La. We were told there are a total of 7 stations each serving food from a different (mostly Asian) region, a salad bar and desert bar but I barely made it through 5 stations, there was a lot to eat at each! All the food I had was fresh, tasty and well prepared especially the seafood
5
Very filling and very sumptuous. Each morning of my 4 day-stay I could explore the different types of cuisine served in the buffet. I started with American, followed by Indian, then Chinese. And I had to repeat the Chinese since I was in Singapore. :-)
4
Very widespread choice for breakfast buffet - everything you could want from East & West and everywhere in between- but 56SGD!
4
Buffer breakfast spread was unbelievable, can match prego of swissotel/raffles city hall. Maybe their forte is buffet coz ala carte dinner we had limited choices.Nonetheless, i ordered satay and it turned out okay. Husband ordered fried rice and it was.......yucky! They actually added mixed vege in there, how uncreative right
5
Me and my partner decided to visit the restaurant last minute on saturday evening, when we reach there we found out that reservation is required for they are fully packed on weekends.We were welcomed with smile by the hostess, and the manager was there as well greeting and welcoming us. They manage to find a table for us, by the window where we have a view of flyer.There were seven stations in all, Japanese, Local, Indian, Thai, Western, Salad bar & Dessert station. Generally the food quality was pretty good and its tasty! Presentation can be improved.Most of the food selections are those that we familiar with and that we will enjoy it no matter how many times w eat it. The buffet also comes with one type of local beverage,coffee and selection of teas.The staff is friendly,attentive and always keep smiling. The manager walk around the restaurant and going around the table and asking if everything is fine and if we enjoying our dinner. Good food, good service and affordable price.Wonderful experience

Breakfast at The Edge was crazy amounts of food and variety - all of rather high standards - thumbs up! I ate there for 2 whole hours and didnt even manage to try everything. Selection include Chinese, Indian, Korean, Japanese and of course western. You'll really be spoilt for choice here. But I spotted the staff at the coffee machine using expired milk to make a cappuccino and using bare hands to handle fruits meant for juicing so watch out. Just not sure if its worth it to have breakfast here if your package doesnt include breakfast as it costs $56 per pax after taxes otherwise.

We really enjoyed the foie gras and wagyu, they were done almost to perfection. The concept is great too, having so many stations hosting different varieties and nationalities of foods.But service was really appalling.1. When we arrived at Edge's reception, the lady front-of-house was chatting with customers who seemed were about to leave. Now building rapport with customers is one thing, but we stood there for a good 2 minutes, and she totally ignored us. What is this??? We were made to feel like less important customers.2. Feeling ignored, we walked 10 meters into Edge to look for other staff to help us. Told the staff my name, and upon checking with the lady front-of-house who finally stopped chatting, lady front-of-house shouted across, "Which Mary? Ask for the surname." Seriously, we were standing RIGHT BETWEEN the two staff. She had to shout across to the other staff to ask us for our surnames instead of politely asking us directly.3. When they finally figured out which reservation we were, we asked about which seats were ours and we wondered if we can have the numerous empty window seats. The second lady staff told us, "you have booth seats and they are not too far from the windows," and continued, "you know there is a stretch between Jap and facing Thai stations, your seats are there". That was our first time there, we really, really won't know where that is.Then at the food stations:- Jap station chef was rather friendly actually. Just that when we asked, "what are your most popular items?" He just said, "Oh you just see on your own lar, see what you like". Still friendly, but not quite professional??- Husband said he stood in front of wagyu station for a while, the station boy chef stood just a meter and didn't bother asking. When husband asked, the chef just plonked the wagyu on his plate without saying anything or smiling...- Went to dessert station where there was nobody to serve the refrigerated items only accessible by staff and there were 3 customers waiting. Someone who look like a head chef walked into the dessert back kitchen and said quite sternly to 2 young staff, "as long as there are customers, you have to out here to serve!" After that head chef left, the girl station chef looked rather upset to serve, then the boy station chef muttered, right in front of us customers, "it's already after 2pm what... why do we still have to be here..." I really don't know what to say...Only redeeming staff was an Indian staff who smiled at us when he refilled our glasses and another tanned young lady staff who billed us. Not sure if the other staff went through training or they were just really tired or even scolded, because these were the only 2 smiles and good service we received throughout our entire dining experience at Edge. Really won't want to return even though they have rather nice food... quite depressing atmosphere overall..
4
Wide selection of options, I counted 7 stations some fab some not so but overall very good (one disappointment was the chilli crab) local and western food alike thought it was fairly reasonable for the price. They unfortunately serve Durian and the table next to us seemed to be fans, which meant we got the scent of the awful stuff so we finished our meal rather quickly.
5
I've eaten at nearly all the big hotel buffets in Singapore, and the Edge is one of the very best. Excellent array of food. Well prepared and presented. It is possible to satisfy nearly every food craving. My only complaint is that the sushi servings are a bit stingy
5
We decided we were too tired to go out after a long, hot day in Singapore - so we stayed in and went to Edge. We had been overindulging on our travels and although tempting we resisted the Buffet and chose the a la carte option. The service at Pan Pacific is superb. Quite reasonable price for what we ordered. The food was delicious- fresh and plentiful. Sometimes you need to leave behind your beliefs that hotel food is ordinary and overpriced. We are so glad we did!!

I went to a business lunch to this restaurant. My business partner made the reservations and I went to the lunch with no expectations whatsoever. On arrival, I understood that we were having a lunch buffet and it was one of the best buffet that I had ever eaten.We were seated in a 'booth' which gives us a lot of privacy. The restaurant also have a lot of 'shades' which provides privacy to many areas. Unlike many buffets which I had gone to which seem to try to 'shock' the patrons with vast amount/variety of foods, Edge lay the food out in various 'stations' spread out in different parts of the restaurants. So there is one section on Indian, South East Asian, Japanese, Italian etc.The food is also very well presented. Instead of huge 'chunks' of food, the food are cut and served in 'bite sizes' which enable me to sample a large variety of food.The food also taste very fresh. For example the sashimi is put in a sushi bar type glass fridge and then cut on demand. The sushi taste very nice. The crispy roast pork is also one of the best I had ever tasted, very soft and fresh and does not taste dry or over-cook at all. One should also try the mini-pizza. Very well made especially for a buffet.They also have a desert area with fondue which is very good also.I will really hope to go back again for a business lunch. The food is tasty and there is privacy for discussion. As it is a buffet, it is quite an efficient use of time as well

We chose not to eat the "buffet" which was expensive, however the food we chose was lovely and very good service
4
So much choice and cool to watch the chefs preparing food in front of you. Everything tasted special.
5
Highly recommend the breakfast at Edge! The food quality is great and the selection is just fantastic: continental, hot, various Asian cuisines, pastries, fruit, freshly squeezed juices, waffles, pancake and even ice cream!
5
Great breakfast.... Everything you might want is available from fresh fruit juice to Japanese food or crepes.
5
Breakfast variety is enormous and quality is good. I have great difficulty deciding hat to eat every morning during my stay.
I also had buffet dinner one night. Good value and very good food. Again great variety and taste. Highly recommended.
5
Two thumbs up!A restaurant befitting the hotel 5-star rating, excellent service from the initial e-reservation right thru to the end billing...The international buffet dinner which we had was among the best, right up there with award-winning Carousel. Cheerful staff prepare your food ala minute at several stations. Fresh and delicious, served with a smile!The restaurant ambience was superb, with lovely and harmonious dÃ©cor themes and seductive mood lighting. Music was played at just the right level too.There's also a wide wine selection from the basic table wines to the upper reaches.Theatrical and interactive experience like no other :
5
Just had the best buffet lunch ever with my dear friends on Sunday (19 May).....Everything I tasted was delicious, from the cold seafood (what a spread - large juicy scallops, not the pathetic small ones served at some places; mussels; alaskan crab; lobster; prawns.... everything was very fresh) to the hot dishes (tempura prawns - freshly prepared and crispy; wanton noodles - the soup had a slight herbal taste which made it very fragrant; laksa - tangy and spicy; roast chicken, roast duck, char siew; sausages; salmon and halibut - both nicely done and tender) to the desserts (cheesecake, chocolate cake and the to die for molten lava chocolate cake - freshly prepared so that it is still warm when you eat it)..The variety is perhaps not the most, but the quality of the food here is definitely the best I had tasted so far.... Everything I put in my mouth is divine... For drinks, juices, tea (many different types) and coffee (variety as well - mocha, cappucino, latte, you name it , they have it) and even hot chocolate were included...The setting was also warm and cosy...... not much background noise and each table was not very close to another table.... there was also partial partition...giving you privacy....If there's one thing to gripe, I will say the table we had was not big enough to accomodate our plates of food....However, service was quite prompt.... and the staff were all very polite....I will highly recommend this place..... it's not that cheap at $68++ but I think you will find that every penny is worth it...

Others have said you can eat around the world at Edge which is true. It is a bit more Asian than Western and if you are a jogurt affacionado (like myself) you will be a bit disappointed from the choice of only plain, but otherwise a fantastic choice. You will not be disappointed.

Stayed at Pan Pacific Hotel and the breakfast buffet at the Edge is part of the room package. I was absolutely delighted to see the huge variety of food in the restaurant. The ambience was good and the staff were attentive to our needs. When we were seated down, they offered to bring us drinks. There are many choices to choose from for the drinks. There was pineapple, orange juice and the usual coffee and tea. You may also approach the staff to prepare other drinks for you as well. The buffet serves local delights such as mee siam, nasi lemak, wanton mee and noodles soup. There was a good spread of donuts, muffins, croissants and toast. Waffle and crepe were served and you can choose to have them with maple syrup and many other sauces to choose from. There was also a Japanese section serving sushi and a dim sum section. I was surprised to find ice cream for a breakfast buffet. You can choose to have it with waffles or cones. The omelette section was quite popular. You can request for a sunny side-up or an omelette with cheese, ham and tomatoes. The Edge definitely allows guests to have their breakfast in comfort. However, do try to wake up early for the breakfast as we saw a queue forming at about 9 plus. The buffet is available from 6-11.30am every morning. I definitely find that the breakfast buffet has made my staycation at Pan Pacific worthwhile. It is a must-try if you are staying there

The top two best meals I've had in a hotel, I had at Edge. We ate here while staying at the Pan Pacific over the American Thanksgiving holiday. We didn't miss the turkey.The spread here boggles the mind, but delights the palate. In two mornings' worth of breakfasts, we still found ourselves full before getting to try everything that looked delicious. Pro tip: Don't miss the dessert section that's tucked further into the dining area from the massive main serving space. Your sweet tooth will thank you
1
Order a medium rear grain fed steak. After a long wait, I was served a medium-well. I informed the serving staff and requested for a new serving. After 20 min, I was served with a steak SO well-done that it was charred on one side!
3
Breakfast food selection almost same everyday. Staff ask if I want tea or coffee after been seated. My choice is coffee but no coffee was serve until I complete my breakfast even I requested twice.
4
spacious, amazing line up of cuisines. try the japanese counter during breakfasts. the cost is on a higher side but still you dont mind it after you eat good quality & the variety you get to choose from
5
Great value for money and excellent food / service. There is so much choice at breakfast and dinner you can't go wrong
5
The spread was enormous. Wish I had a bigger appetite. I'm not a buffet person but I love variety & boy, this place did not dissapoint. My favourite had to be their famous sausages & love their desert counter too which was another HUGE area. Had a wonderful time there
5
The Edge is found on the 3rd floor of Pan Pacific Hotel, and is one of its newer dining experiences. I came here with my family for a weekday dinner in Feb 2013, and it was awesome, well worth my S$68!!! The price comes with free-flow of a selection of drinks like lime juice with sour plum, bandung (rose syrup with milk) etc. The restaurant is very spacious, with plenty of space to navigate around without having to jostle with the other diners, unlike some places. The spread is quite good; they serve international food with generous portions, you can tell from the way they are preparing the food they are upholding some very high quality standards! I must warn the vegetarian diners, I don’t think there’s much catered for you guys though…They have an interesting system of ordering food; they provide you with sticks that indicate your table number, which you can leave with some of the chefs so that you don’t have to wait while they prepare your food, they’ll deliver it to your table! The waitresses are more than welcome to explain how the system works when you arrive at your table, so don’t worry! The service staff are very warm and friendly! One of them took the initiative and volunteered to take a family photo for us! =)Surprisingly none of the food is labelled, so there are times I have no idea what I’m having! It’s annoying to always have to ask them sometimes, especially when not all of them seem willing to open their mouths. The chef doing the satay deserves special commendation for being so polite and friendly; he greeted everyone who came to his station with a warm smile! That’s excellent customer service!!! I suppose they are striving for that personal touch which does spice up your dining experience, though it might be difficult to achieve if they are flooded with diners on weekends. The deserts are religiously guarded by the desert chefs, which again do not have signs, and I think the chef got a little annoyed that I kept asking what was in every desert lol…Overall it’s a great place to have dinner! It doesn’t matter if you’ve got a big family or anything; they’ve got some relatively “private” corners that can accommodate quite a number of people! I highly recommend it for special occassions too!!! I love how the service staff are generally warm and polite, apart from the stone-faced desert chef. I would love to revisit this place on a weekend just to see if the same standards are upheld in a crowded atmosphere. Oh and check out my photos to see what’s offered here at the Edge
4
everything. If you want to have breakfast in europe, korea, japan, thailand, uk, singapore..its all hear to taste and EAT...try the fresh pressed fruit drink with a touch of ginger. I had fresh apple and ginger everyday. what a great way to start the day
5
The breakfast buffet is vast with international and Asian selections, don't forget to try the freshly squeezed fruit juices. Also, ask to be served the freshly ground coffee - much tastier than that in the pots that is offered around. Particularly like to sit on the sofas for a leisurely weekend breakfast
5
Stayed in PP in October 2012 and the buffet breakfast absolutely floored me! I have never seen such a wide array of food choices and EVERYTHING was delicious! Staff were polite, attentive and efficient even though the restaurant was packed that morning. The buffet was colourfully spread out in the middle of the fairly large restaurant, which made the food look as good as it was tasty. I'll definitely stay in PP again for the breakfast (P.S. the rooms are only so-so)
5
Tremendous food display. food was fantastic .excellent presentation of food . well mannered service staff. highy recommended restaurant to dine in. very spacious and great atmosphere. No regret of returning to the the restaurant to dine in.I would highly recommend to all friend and relatives to dine in the restaurant Edge
5
Awsome Buffet, such good price, nothing missing. They even had some drinks included. They have oysters and lots of sea food. Desert, chocolate soufle made to order and served to your table. really recommend. Plus free wifi.
4
Had the Dinner Buffet with my team over here... It was exotic and had a widespread.. Vegetarians would not have much options so beware.. Do try the Thai cuisines
5
variety was exceptional. The omlettes were particulary well done as were the curries. Give it a try you won't be sorry
5
Great buffet with so many options. dessert is fantasic with the chocolate fountain! yummmmm would definitely recommend
5
The best breakfast buffet , the first time I went I missed some of the areas , the choice is so large , just make sure that the price for breakfast is included in your room rate - its well worth it .

I just had New Years brunch at Edge. We made reservations at the earliest available slot- 11:30am- and when we arrived there was a lot of noise from the buffet stations setting up, which the hostess apologized for but assured us the stations were open. We started to walk around but few stations had food out and those that did had no serving ware. The chefs were clearly busy getting things going and were gruff when asked if there was any serving ware so we went back to our table to wait a bit. The cleaning staff was sitting at our table mopping up the floor underneath and we were told to sit at another table to wait until they were finished. While we were waiting, a hostess came and sat another family at our table (with our bags still there). We got the table sorted and I asked a waitstaff why the restaurant had opened if the food and tables weren't ready yet. Apparently the breakfast had run late so they had just switched over to lunch. It's an understandable problem but it did mean that we had to wait 30 minutes with a hungry toddler before we felt like the stations were comfortably open. Also, we asked several people what drinks were included in the price of the buffet (including the bar staff) and they said simply the prepared juices. Later we saw people getting cappuccino, Bloody Mary's and fresh squeezed juices. When asked directly "Does --- come with the buffet?", we were told yes but it took a while to figure out the system and I still don't know exactly what all we paid for in the price of the brunch.
5
We ate at Edge Restaurant on 18th Dec for dinner. The food was very delicious (steak was incredible!) and very reasonably priced for Singapore ($55++), which included a selection of soft drinks. The atmosphere was lovely and the staff were very friendly and couldn't do enough to help. There is a huge variety of food available which caters for everyone. The only improvement point we could find was that the food has no labels - therefore you had to ask the chefs at each station what each of the dishes were. However, they were all very knowledgeable and suggested other dishes to accompany what was already on my plate. Overall we really enjoyed our visit, and will return
4
Hosted colleagues from overseas as wanted them to be able to try a variety of food, especially local food. The restaurant is huge, and we were seated at a nook just by ourselves but not too far from food action yet have privacy. Square table for 8 of us which was wonderful for conversations with everyone unlike long table. Wide variety of selections from seafood on ice (impressive selection) to local (laksa was lemak) to Indian (ok) to western (again good variety and selection) to grill ( pan PAC bockwurst lip smacking) and desserts (selection not bad). One's eyes are probably wider than the stomach and you need to be selective by choosing your favorites.. Quality is very good for a buffet, where portions are prepared in small quantity so they stay fresh. Overall, it was a very pleasant dinner for our group. Plan to be back again during Chinese New Year. And for $58++, outstanding value

The Edge Restaurant (formally the Global Kitchen) is a large open design restaurant on the 3rd Floor with separate stations (kitchens) preparing fresh and exciting food in a warm and inviting atmosphere. It has food offerings of Western, Malay, Chinese, Indian, Thai, Singaporean and Japanese.Chefs are available at each station to explain each dish and answer any questions as needed about their food. I would recommend walking around all stations first before making your selection as the selection of food is extensive and will please all diners. Unlike a traditional buffet, some of the items can be cooked to order. If you want your steak medium you place the order with the chef at the required station, hand them a stick (provide on the table) with the table number and it will be brought to the table when ready.All food is cooked or prepared in small potions, which guarantees it to always be fresh and tasty.The staff are exceptionally friendly and attentive and canâ€™t fault their service. We be sure to visit again when next in Singapore
5
The challenge of eating at Edge is knowing what to take because you can't eat all of the offerings of Western, Chinese, Malay, Indian, Singaporean, Thai, and Japanese delicacies. So it is best to look at all of the food stations before making a choice. For dinner, they provide a box of sticks at each table. You hand the chef a stick with your table number on it, and when the meat is cooked, the stick is returned to your table when the food is delivered by a waitress. My wife had a tenderloin steak that was quite delicious. We found the Indian food quite poor with dry, thin naan. I liked the fried man-to with pork and baby kai lan leaves. I had to go back for a second helping of strawberries and cream ice cream with real strawberries inside, and blueberry ice cream. Breakfast at Edge was included in our room package at the Pan Pacific. Breakfast is served until 11 am, an hour longer than at most hotels. Once again, there are too many offerings ranging from chicken curry and paratha to crepes with ice cream and jam. You kind of have to stick to your favorites until your stomach is stretched too far. They frequently run out of breakfast steaks. I rate the croissants 4 out of 5. No waiting at the egg station. Streaky bacon but no back bacon available. Real good variety of cereals. The greeters tended to seat diners all in a bunch near the windows, but we preferred the more private sofa area where presumably diners could read the newspaper or even lie down, Imperial Roman style, while eating. The attentive staff bring and refill coffee and tea. They have delicious guava juice and sugar cane juice. We consider Edge among our top 5 Singapore buffet restaurants for breakfast and dinne
