This is by far one of the most authentic Perankan food I've tried. The price is reasonable too. I also liked the sarong kebaya, beaded slippers, and porcelain tiles that are framed as decorations.

Very good Peranakan food in a relaxing little cafe with friendly staff. Reasonably priced but very strong and good flavour. Dessert is nice too.

After a walk trough the wonderful and bewildering Changi Village Hawker food area, we wandered over to the row of restaurants across the road. Using the time honoured way of selecting a restaurant by the number of diners, this was a great success. Lovely food, a great vegetable dish, chicken satay and beef rendang and our taste buds went into overload. Add to this friendly helpful service and you have a potent mix! This is a really good find, and well worth going to to experience how good food could be

Location is abit off but the 30 mins travel from the city for this is well worth it!!Recommended - Ayam Buah Keluak..... Sotong Hitam...... ChapChye.... Ayam Goreng.... sambal petai..... Babi Pontay.....One of the few Peranakan restaurants that serve pork.... i hope they continue to do that.Definitely one of the few restaurants missed out by Michelin Guide!

Very good Peranakan food. The assam sotong is very good and the nyonya chap chye and babi ponteh found great favour with my kids who do not eat spicy food. My parents enjoyed the bakwan kepeting soup and the beef rendang. The proprietor, Irene and her assistant, Serene, are very helpful and patient.A great place for food

Chanced upon this restaurant while wandering around Changi village for dinner. Liked the menu, all our traditional favourites were on it. So Glad we did. Food was homely and flavoured right... we truly enjoyed the Babi Chinchalok, Ngo Hiang, Ayam Sio, Chap Chye, and Itek Tim. Even the drinks were great, lemongrass and Chin chow, sweetened to taste. Very refreshing. Service was quick and efficient and they didn't hesitate to advise if we ordered too much. They also held off when we ordered more drinks, until our current Ines were finished so they wouldn't be diluted... wonderful!A delightful experience indeed... at an extremely reasonable price! I'm definitely coming back

We came for dinner after reserved a table for 4. Friendly and prompt service. Ambience is good on a weekend Monday and not crowded at all. The Peranakan dishes of Ayam buah keluak, Sotong Hitam, ikan Pari Kuah ladah, Lemak Nangka, sambal and achar tasted so so only.Only come here if you're craving for Peranakan food and do happened to be in the vicinity of Changi Village, Singapore

Me and my wife visit this restaurant regularly. It may not be the best perankan restaurant in Singapore but we enjoy the food here. The ngoh hiang is lovely and babi sio is very tasty. Kang kong is well fried. It's worth a try. It's a small restaurant so better make a booking. They are also closed on wed. Avoid weekends as parking in Changi Village is a nightmare.

The irascible and irreverent Travelling Gourmet TM ventures to a remote part of Singapore to try the food at…MOST out of the way “Good O Times” Peranakan restaurant in rustic Changi Village…This was near where the old SAF Commando Camp was and the old Changi Hospital. My seat was right in the corner to the right of the entrance which was not cooled by the aircons at all which made it hot…very hot, and I started sweating profusely. Then the food arrived. There was an off colour Beef Rendang, black Ayam Buah Keluak, somewhat oily Babi Pong The (Pork), Minced deep fried prawn Fritter, Kiam Chye Ark Theng or Duck and Salted vegetable Soup, Achar, Chap Chye with glass noodles and more. I would like to say otherwise…BUT the food is rather average by my book. You see, I am a true-blue Malay speaking Baba and I must state that the BEST Nyonya Peranakan Food is cooked by true-blue Nyonyas, like my beloved Mum! There are those who rave about so-called Nyonya restuarants, and wax ever so lyrical about the food…and invariably they are NOT Nyonyas or Babas! For example, the Ayam Buah keluak sauce although thick, did not have enuoght Coriander in it. Moreover it was not tangy at all. The Chap Chye was mushy and not tasty and very bland. It reminded me of poorly cooked British canteen food. The Achar lacked the spicy-sweet-sour flavours all good Achars must have. The mediocre Beef Rendang had beef that was not tender and not spicy enough, and had a weird colour to boot. It was alas a mediocre misinterpretation of the dish. The only nice thing I found was the 2013 Greek Red Table Wine served in a half bottle called Semeli. A tasteful blend of Cabernet Sauvignon and indigenous Greek Ariopritiko grape varietals. Ripe black cherry and mixed spice flavours were quite pleasing on my palate.Ambience wise, the place is small and cramped and as I have said before…very hot in the corner where I was sitting. The service leaves much to be desired. Leonard, the grumpy son of the owner, Irene Tan, is perpetually under stressed and rushes about like a headless chicken. I went to meet and talk to the Chef. His name is Rajan from Bangalore in India. A nice Indian gentleman. I asked him where he learned to cook Peranakan food. His reply was frank and honest. “I learned when I came to Singapore.” Also Chef Rajan tries hard and his food is not inedible BUT I strongly believe that only genuine Peranakan Nyonya and Babas can cook Peranakan food with any measure of success, using the good ol’ intuitive cooking technique beloved of Nyonya Grandmas.So there you have it…I won’t be coming back here soon…Life is uncertain, eat dessert first.

Fortunate enough to have brought here by my Singaporean friends after I expressed a desire to sample authentic Peranakan cooking. Couldn't have asked for a better place. Loved the food. Loved the service and the ambience. Go back? Of course!!

Ayam buah keluak was delicious! It is hard to get authentic tasting nyonya food these days, and although this place is kind of hidden, it is worth the drive.
5
My friends took us this restaurant. It is near Changi airport and you can take taxi there. Many traditional Peranakan cusine are available here, and many similar food can not be tasted elsewhere.

This is my favourite Nyonya restaurant in Singapore. Great value and conveniently located near the Changi Village Hotel for that quick transfer to the Airport. The food is quintessential Malay/Peranakan. Try the Chicken Candlenut and the Chilli Fish.....Lordy, it's unbelievably good! Once you've dined here you will return time and time again. For me it's a destination Restaurant.The Waitress (Harmony?) is just such a happy, welcoming person, she makes you feel at home and has a great memory for names. Ask her for menu suggestions

I have been a regular at this restaurant since my friend and I chanced upon it years ago. So, I am a familiar face to Irene, her son Leonard and the very friendly waitress, Serene. Leonard knows our favorite items like Ayam Buah Keluak, Babi Assam, Ngoh Hiang (Meat Rolls), Babi Sioh and Babi Ponteh whenever we visit; the first two items are a must for us! We always left the restaurant totally satisfied. I am not Peranakan but I love the cuisine and have tried eateries all over the country. Good O' Times is probably my favorite. Their gravies are full of aroma and always rich in the different spices. Beware of Irene's sambal blachang (chilli-paste)

This was our second visit, which of course implies that the first time was good enough for us to want to return. Although the night was not particularly hot, we chose to eat in the airconditioned indoor part, even though the tables are rather close together here. Tables for two are particularly close together; the four-seater ones are slightly better. The service is friendly, informal and quick. But it's the food which will make you want to go back. The first time we went was with some well-travelled overseas guests, who remarked that the food was truly marvellous, and unlike anything they had experienced before in their worldwide travels. This time we had the beef rendang (which we noticed that all the other tables were also ordering) and prawn curry. As a starter we shared a side dish of spring-roll - and we were pleased that we had chosen to share this as even though priced at $5 it was ample for two people. We regretted that this, the rendang and prawn filled us so well that we were unable to order any of the other treats on the menu. With rice and beer (plus service and tax) the bill came to less than $50. We will most definitely be back

We were on transit from Cambodia to Australia and only in Singapore for a few hours. This was a fantastic place for a quick and cheap meal. It is an excellent example of the great food that can be found in Singapore if you can escape the tourist traps. The staff were incredibly friendly.

Recommed by my friend and went there to have dinner with my family. The food was good as what my friend had told me. Beef redang was very tender and tasty. I can say Its was the best beef redang i ever tasted so far. Must try if u happen to be there

A cosy place for a good authentic Peranakan family dinner. This is definitely value for money in term of quality of food and price. Foods are not too spicy. I like the beef rendang and the Chap Chye. Try also the curry fish. Customer Service is good, even if they are short-handed, they try to serve with a smile. The place can be crowded, so making reservation will help. But no such reservation for car-park. It can be frustrating just trying to park your car. You still need to drive, unless you don't mind taking a taxi. Great place, great food, great company
