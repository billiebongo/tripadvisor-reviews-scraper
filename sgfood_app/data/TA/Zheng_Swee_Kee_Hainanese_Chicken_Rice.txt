We randomly stumbled upon this place and absolutely loved it. The chicken was slightly bland BUT the marmite shrimp is so goood. Portions are generous as well :)

Decent for a get-together with friends or a weekend meal with family. The traditional steamed chicken was done quite well, although the rice was lacking in fragrance and forgettable. Would probably prefer Wee Nam Kee when I have a steamed Hainanese chicken rice craving.

We went there and had difficulty finding a seat. We ordered chicken and a vege dish and found the quality of food to be ordinary. The level of service was wanting and cleanliness was also an issue with table greasy with dripping. The standard very much that of a street food stall

Well, rather disappointed experience. Quality of food had dropped. Tasted as any other chicken rice in anywhere. What made it worst was the staff service standard. A bill was brought to us in a demanding tone in the middle of our meal!! We didn't ask for it!

Eat here to enjoy chicken like the locals! This ain't fancy, but the portion sizes are good, it's hot and it's cheap! The service was really fast and although we had difficulty with the language, we laughed together and sorted things out!Hint: There are two menus, with different things on them. Not different prices (so no gouging) just different items. Thoroughly enjoyed the food here. Sat on small plastic seats and ate like we knew what we were doing! Right next to the Mint Toy Museum which is also worth a visit.Recommen

Hands down the best local chicken and rice my boyfriend and I have tried in Singapore! We've been to many of the over glorified 'chicken and rice' restaurants such as 'Boon Tong Kee' and 'Chatterbox' however nothing compares to the authenticity of the chicken and rice at this local establishment. I recommend simply ordering 1 steamed Kampong chicken with 1 serving of the chicken rice. Every time my boyfriend and I come here that's all we order and it's never disappoints, and we've been coming here at least once a week ever since we've moved to Singapore

I'm a fan of Singapore chicken rice. Especially the steamed white ones. The key things that any fan will focus on are the rice, the sauces, and the chicken in no particular order. It's the combination of all three that distinguishes a great chicken rice from a good one. I spotted some of the off shift chefs from nearby restaurants enjoying their lunches here too!This place serves tender steamed chicken rice. So I can assume that use only female chick that are presumably more succulent. It can be little tasty for the initiated or those who prefer less salty meals. The chili and ginger sauces are one of the best I've seen locally. It's not your usual dilute offering. The colors are rich and thankfully lives up to their appearances. The rice is somewhat ordinary. For those who want the more healthy option, ask for white rice. Options such as the side green leafy vegetables are fresh and so are the gizzards for those who like them. Overall the place offers a decent meal for those in the area. There is also an air conditioning area for the hotter days. The old reason why I've not given it 5 stars is that fact that it's not outstanding despite being just good.

Price is reasonable and just steps away from the Raffles/Fairmont/Swissotel properties. Indoor and outdoor seating, service is quick and efficient. Drinks are purchased separately, pick and choose; pay at the counter instead of together with the bill at end of meal. They charge I think 30 cents for a pack of tissues, something that I have seen some places do. I still find that strange. It's not bad but it's not great. It will satisfy your hunger but definitely tried better hainese chicken dishes in hawker centres. The skin could be less fattening imo. Sounds weird because chicken skin is fat, but I've tried places where the skin is slightly thicker than a piece of paper. It is not so here. However, there's a chicken organ dish that is done right in case you're traditional Chinese or really up for a dare

The chicken rice here is decent quality and fairly good value for money. We opted for the kampong chicken set with some vegetables on the side: all very tasty. Service was efficient. Drinks are purchased separately.

Walked past at lunch time and it was really full with locals, so decided to go there for dinner. Disappointing - nothing to rave about.

I love the food for its taste and nice decor of the outlet. its specialty is eating it alone or with my best buddies. I like seeing waiters serve me in this restaurant.

The standard is pretty average but a little pricey. Chicken rice is a very common fare in Singapore, many more good ones out there.

The chicken rice was average as the steamed chicken was slightly overcooked. I have to say the rice & ginger sauce was the savior! The Hainanese fried Beehoon was good as well.Service was efficient and the setting of the restaurant is like a Chinese coffee shop. Value for money

We were at a loss as to what to have when my wife, a native Singaporean, came upon this place near Raffles Hotel. She said it was one of the old time chicken rice shops. So, we tried it. Age hasn't improved it. We had 1/4 of the white chicken, which seemed salty to us. We also had a tofu and salted vegetable soup, which was ok, a veggie dish with egg, which was also ok, and the chicken rice itself. Nothing really popped out at us and, as noted, the star of the show, the chicken, was very disappointing.There aren't a lot of choices for chicken rice in the area, save for food courts in the various malls. But this just doesn't cut it. Travel to one of the many Boon Tong Kee's or go to hawker centers and find stalls with long lines. You'll likely get a better meal than we did

Came here for lunch with my wife and my parents. Was quite nice to try the famous Zheng Swee Kee chicken rice. Oh yeah, the "new Zheng Swee Kee" is owned by the brother of this shop (family disputes).Service - Friendly and efficient.Food - Chicken was well cooked and as with most of Chicken rice, the taste comes from the sauce (which is very tasty). However, the chicken did have a nice flavour to it while the rice was also flavoured with chicken stock. Ordered dish of vegetables with oyster sauce and was quite nice.Value - Not too expensive considering its location.Overall - Decent chicken rice but I was never a big fan (my dad is) so wouldn't particular return for more

If you find yourself in the Raffles hotel vicinity and are up to trying what many regard as Singapore's national dish, there are a couple of places in the Seah Street/Purvis street area that you could have a meal.Zheng Swee Kee is one of the three chicken rice coffee shops. What you get is fairly tasty though not the absolute best you can find in Singapore.The picture menus are quite helpful to the uninitiated. We had the S$7.80 set meal with roast chicken - see pictures (there is also he more traditional poached version). The house chilli sauce was good - it's made from minced fresh chillies, ginger, garlic, lime juice and white vinegar.Prices are not exactly low but you have to remember this place is located in the civic district of central Singapore so it's very much the equivalent of having a meal at an air conditioned cafe in the city.For the truly good stuff, you'd have to head to the food courts in the suburbs, to Chinatown complex or the Maxwell road food court. If you don't have the time or inclination to seek these out but want to try a competent representation of chicken rice (without paying extortionate hotel prices), Zheng Swee Kee will do just fine.

We had dinner here on our first night in Singapore. This eating house was a few doors from our hotel in Seah Street. It is directly across the street from a wing of Raffles, but the contrast could not be more stark. Opulence on one hand and basic human needs on the other.I had their seafood char kwai teow a dish to which I am very partial, it was very good. My wife, who loves soups, had a long and short soup. She said the wonton were especially good. We had chrysanthemum tea with our meal. Yeo's must have changed their formula becuse it is even sweeter than before, and believe me in years of working in Malaysia and Singapore, I've drunk alot of it

I frequent this chicken rice shop because it's near the library where I study on the weekend. For $7.80 I paid for a chicken rice set, the chicken portion is extremely small. The owner probably think he can be rich by selling chicken rice this way. Taste is just ok. I will not come back again. Don't waste your money for this chicken rice. There are better places which offer better amount and taste than this.
