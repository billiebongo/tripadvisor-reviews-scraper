Lighting was really dim and the bright candle light was a little overbearing. Food made up for everything :)
5
the ambiance is so sexy here. i think red black. food is also superb. luckily i came with friends who are regulars so they knew exactly what to order. i love spanish food. its so rich n tasty. definitely coming back for more.
5
Great place to gather with friends around delicious food and wine ! Staff is great and made my bday amazing :) Thanksss
PS you gotta try the patatas bravas !
5
Great place to host events at El Tardeo, they have projector & screen plus such a chill out ambience. Food was excellent, must try their lamb!! Service wise, I'm always impressed :)
4
We had lunch and later dinner also in this restaurant. It has a nice modern Spanish-like atmosphere. The dishes with traditional names as Patatas Bravas are quite surprising (in a positive way), because of the special twist.
5
Delicious tapas by the same owners as Binomio. It was my birthday and they were so kind and accommodating, even with a surprise for me and my friends!
5
Food is delicious, they use freshest ingredients. Staff are very friendly and helpful. The ambience was great. We will be back SOON.

The jury is still out on this one. We ordered 5 tapas. Three of them were pretty good, two of them much less so. The last one even never appeared, so when we didn't get anything after 20min or so we asked what was wrong? It then turned out they forgot about it, so we could have waited for a very long time had we not asked... The manager apologised several times and offered us a round of drinks on the house. So that was a very nice gesture and something you don't often get in Singapore. Given that we enjoyed some very good tapas, we will go back once more to decide if we want to go a lot more because we frequent tapas bars a lot in Singapore, they're one of our favourite food places. So I would give them the benefit of the doubt for the time being, with another visit in the near future deciding if this is a stayer or not. I hope yes
5
I have been to this Tappas Place for the 2nd time for the 2nd time of the year and this place does not fail to dish up great small bites with a concoction of nice parring cocktails and mocktails. This is a sister place or binimio
3
Heard about this place from friend for its Gin collection, so I went there with a friend to check out their drinks. The drink is decent but the service was poor. The wait staff weren't attentive and just talking among themselves. We saw our drinks ready to be served but just sitting idle on the bar top and the wait staff didn't pay attention to it. It finally served to us and the glass was already sweaty and crushed ice in my drinks were mostly melted
3
Food was great but service can be improved. The food took a while to be served and was over charged by $16.
4
Tasty tapas! Reasonable price. Great cocktails varieties.
The service staffs are polite, friendly and helpful.
4
Good value for money great service yummy food. They serve some of my favorite tapas. Gambas alijos is one of my favorite and they did an excellent job on it! The other not to be missed is the waffles patatas and pepper stuffed cod fish.
5
Food was excellent and service was good when it was not crowded. Once it got crowded, we ask for a beer which took like 15-20mins after multiple attempts to get one beer to a friend who arrived late. Other than this good was great and price was reasonable! Overall I would recommend this place
4
My friends and I went for drinks at El Tardeo on a Wed night, and food was excellent. The place wasn't food but service seemed to be a bit slow (though the servers were quite helpful and pleasant). Our small pan of paella took more than an hour to be served to us. But our experience was great overall, we would definitely come back
1
Investing in a restaurant is a major undertaking in capital, renovations, menu planning, food development, wine collection etc. And to have that investment wasted by an uninterested staff that prioritizes cleaning their nails behind the bar, rather than take a customer's order, is beyond comprehension. But that was my experience at El Tardeo tonight. Why fight to get your order taken from the two bartenders when you're the only person sitting at the bar? To his credit, the host tried to recover from their sad service failure. At that point, I couldn't stomach it (pun intended!
2
We always eat at Binomio next door and its always excellent, thus had high expectation for El Tardeo. We were pleasantly surprise with the very reasonable price and good taste of the tasting tapas- the Oxtail sandwich stands out while the rest are good, if nothing special. But no lower price deserve bad customer service! Ordered the squid ink paella which was small, hubby and I took one big spoon each and to our dissapointment the texture was too soft like plain rice. Called waiter to check which said 'it IS rice' but kind enough to offer to check with chef. The same came back with the front guy who said theres nothing wrong also since we 'almost finish' it.. the tone suggesting we dont know how a paella should taste and looking for a free dinner.. we were very upset and asked for the bill immediately. Thank you but we wont be back
5
Ben & Burn make an amazing team together. They had an eye for detail. They were very efficient and consistent throughout the night. The drinks were intelligently crafted by Ben and was so very refreshing. I loved the hint of Rosemary. Burn was incredibly perceptive and kind to recommend food for me to nibble on from the menu. Good music and good booze. Forget about Golden cafes or whatever. This outlet is truly a gem. Thank you guys! â˜
2
Spanish restaurant with attractive menu. We took 8 tapas, the classic ones you can find in usual tapas place. Must say that they are tasteless, not bad taste but no taste. Portion is good and service good. A bit noisy if you have some people who are noisy, as the room doesn't manage well sound and provide some echo. So I was disappointed and don't think deserve the current rating. May be people like it as they have not been lucky to taste really tapas taste.
5
Ben, the general manager took our orders and as with the first time I was there, gave us an excellent repertoire of tapas. What made the difference was that he went the extra mile to provide us complimentary moscato/wine, it being a Tuesday ladies night, even though it was the eve of a public holiday. Thanks Ben. You're an asset to El Tardeo. Our quiet corner was not quiet for long; it was after all, a bar with techno music. The food and service made up for it.
5
Working in Singapore for 5 weeks at a time I went for food which is great but continue to go back because the staff are just so welcoming. And and the gin is so so good. Just love the place
3
Food was average, serving time was about 30 mins even though the restaurant wasn't crowded. I feel that the portions were small especially for its price. But it has good ambience for small gathering.
5
Excellent food, awesome drinks, and wonderful service! That's why we love El Tardeo! Kudos to the team... Gavin, Ben, Burn, Guru.... And of course the culinary team headed by Jose and Hussein! Definitely one of our fave hangouts!
5
As a Spaniard, I totally recommend this restaurant. Great tapas and service. Then, lots of gins and cocktails. I love it!
5
Every dish was delicious and service was superb! We were given wine on the house which was a pleasant surprise
4
Had the Tapas along with my wife and son. Quality of food was very good albeit they forgot about 2 dishes we ordered until we reminded them. This did not detract from the quality of experience. If you want to experience a restaurant that offers a huge choice of gins, good Tapas and friendly and accommodating staff then definitely worth a visi
5
Chance upon this place while strolling around the area. Their happy hour selection of wines are good. The tapas were simply delicious. From our initial intention of 5 tapas we progressed to 11 tapas (consumed by 2 ladies!!). Everyone there are so wonderful. I strongly recommend this place for tapas, wine and more..
4
The staff are extremely friendly & helpful.Their wine selection is pretty good for Singapore but the star of the show is their amazing selection of Gins & their ability to really enhance them with different trimmings.The food is reasonably good by Singaporean/Spanish standards but not excellent
4
Went here with a group on a Saturday evening. The place is somewhat barn like but did fill up as the evening progressed. Overall I really liked the place. However, the food was only ok - all started to taste similar after a while. Nothing wrong with any of it but not outstanding. However, El Tardeo has an outstanding gin selection in the true Spanish style and the staff were very proud of it. It is probably a work in progress but the collection is impressive. And even better the staff were friendly and very accommodative to our group, something that is often lacking in restaurants in Singapore. A welcome addition to the map
5
This is our 2nd visit and everything was superb. With the exception of the suckling pork which was too salty for our taste. The kitchen wanted to bring us a new portion but we were too full. They didn't charge us in the end which was a very nice gesture.Thank you for the wonderful service.
5
Was looking for a place that has organic wine on the menu and this is it. I seriously had a blast here. The food was great and the service was super. If you're not sure what to order, the manager Gavin gives excellent suggestions.
3
The food here is pretty good, just a bit oily for my particular tastes. The restaurant week menu gave a small but decent selection of tapas at a reasonable price. Dessert was mediocre.
5
El Tardeo is one of the few places in Singapore I return to often. I always have delicious tapas there. They always changw the menu and come up with interesting dishes. I am glad they always keep the Oxtail Sandwich though! That is my fave!!
4
Good food for group of friends to chill out dinner and splurge. Classy and simple atmosphere. Service is excellent too.
5
Spanish friends of ours suggested this restaurant, and we were very impressed by the flavour and size of the tapas. Being our first Spanish meal in SG we will definitely be going back. Service was friendly and quick.
5
Very good experience. Loved the variety and creativity of the tapas. A must in Singapore if you want to try tapas. Nice service and speed. Loved it.
3
Very nice place with nice and friendly staff Good selection of tapas from starter to mainThe ox tail is amazing Slightly too expensive for a tapas place though, although the quality is good, this is not Binomio ( even though is the same company)Overall not too ba
3
Nice ambience. Oxtail sandwich was very tender. The squid ink rice and garlic prawns were too heavy handed with the salt and we could not finish due to the saltiness. Great service from restaurant manager but the waiters seem to be less attentive and forget the requests
4
We had a really enjoyable dinner here with family while out and about in Singapore. Overall the tapas was delicious, the fried Padron peppers, the Oxtail sandwich, garlic shrimp and guacamole were wonderful. They also have a great selection of spanish wines and a full cocktail bar. I would definitely go back to this one. The service was great as well
4
We regularly go here for Sunday Brunch, Cana's, Tapas and Red Wine. They also do a mean G&T. I missy admit there are better places to eat Tapas but this place has the atmosphere nailed! Highlights are the Garlic Prawns. To me when you go to a Tapas restaurant the two dishes you always try are Albondigas(Meatballs) and Hamon Croquettas. Unfortunately there are better places to go for both of these dishes but the ambience just works
5
A wonderful little find for a casual after work drink with friends. The chef brought us an appetiser so that we wouldn't get hungry while waiting for our friends to arrive. The selection of food and drinks was also a great balance.
5
been there twice - nice tapas (love the eggs on chorizo and toast), excellent service, good atmosphere, great cocktails.
4
Cool little tapas restaurant There is a private room that can be closed off for small parties Shrimp and garlic with a Spanish fusion flare. The cheese and meet plate is a great starter If you order sangria you can order a bottle where they fill a bottle with enough for 5 glasses Great ambience good service and a nice find
4
Went for drinks after dinner. Fab G&T's different to the usual and watching the barman was like watching a science experiment he was so precise! Would have given 5* but thought it was a little pricey.
1
These guys are gaming trip advisor with their own reviews. This is singularly the worst service I've experienced in Singapore. We came here for drinks on a night when they were not overly busy. The service staff were more focused on attending to their phones and friends who were in the bar and not looking after paying patrons. There are many bars in this area, find another. I believe the food is ok, but didn't have the opportunity to assess. I don't believe it is superior to the many good Spanish restaurants around, so a deal breaker if they can't get their service right. The best suckling pig is up the road at 'In Italy', wander up and knock yourself out
4
Had been to El-tardeo for their superb cocktails and binomio for tapas & dinner. Finally, i had a chance to try El-tardeo's tapas this time round.Had grilled chorizo, coca burratina,patatas bravas, squid croquettes, oxtail sandwiches. All the items were superb in taste and well presented. Prices are reasonable and value for the money. Service is fantastic! Well trained managers. Will definitely return and recommend other friends to patron this venue.
5
So glad we tried this place!We had tried the other one next door, Binomio, I heard they both in the same management. Both of them are awesome.El Tardeo has more cozy, laid-back atmosphere. Service is good, the total of servant are quite small number for a not-so-small place but they're quick and present.We had a lot of tapas and their cold cuts, left the place very very full!Price is quite expensive I must say but it was a good dinner, worth every penny
4
I love El Tardeo. I've been there at least 5 times now, and always have a nice time. I think it helps that the wines are really amazingly reasonable at $7 a glass and also, there's a nice Ladies night promotion every Tues, where we get free bubbly all night long!The food is great too. From the typical Croquetas to more interesting items like my favourite, the Oxtail Sandwich - a crispy skinned but tender and flaky meat sandwich - their dishes start from $5 and you can have a great time without breaking the bank.Friendly service, great ambience, really cool place for a night out with colleagues or friends
3
We went there to grab something for dinner after reading good reviews. However, as I am from Spain, I have to admit that I couldn't agree less with them. Service was great, but overall quality was miles away from Spanish standards at that price. That being said, if you go there, definitely try out the gin-tonics. Please avoid the churros at all cost
4
Being lovers of tapas and El Tardo being on our doorstep we have been here many times now. On a couple of occasions we have dined as a couple and other times with a group of friends. Whether you want good evening drinks with light bites or a full meal, this place has the options. My personal favourite is the chorizo with fried egg hot tapas. Would definitely recommend this place if your dining in the area
5
Extremely talented bartenders! Drinks were custom-made to my liking, love it love it loveeee it! People there are super cool and friendly to! Never a dull night at El Tardeo. Could spend hours there without feeling bored! Highly recommendeddddddddd ;D
5
I love this place so so much. The hospitality is amazing and the cocktails they make are out of the world. Great vibes, great crowd, great food, great drinks... what more do you need? Highly recommended!!!!
5
A few months ago we had tapas at Binomio and saw El Tardeo next door and checked out the menu. Both places have the same owner. At el Tardeo the chef himself came to our table and talked to us bout their signature dishes. We were 2 couples and ordered lots of tapas. About 8 or 9. We lived them all except 1. And that may just be a matter of taste. All in all the food was great. Service was good for local standards. Place was a little loud at peak hours but fun crowd some Spanish which is a good sign. I recommend you check it out. I do plan to go back.
5
I have visited El Tardeo several times with my mates. The food is amazing. They make amazing original cocktails. Please try the old fashion with Diplomatico ! The tapas is delicious! Please try the fried baby squid, squid croquetas, cojonudo, mushrooms, mini burgers ... The list goes on ! Please try the Sunday brunch too as they have special pintxos.. On desserts : they have chocolate croquetas which were original! The churro were okay .. We're a bit greasy for my liking ... The whiskey cake was delicious! The restaurant is managed with love and attention to detail. Ben and Vincent are amazing hosts and really looks after the guests. Over all 5 stars and hugs to the team! They make all the difference.
5
The squid croquettes are a must-try as are the pork belly. The food is delightful and good value, and the wines are both well-priced and . You can get a decent bottle of wine for S$45 and I believe a glass starts at $7. I went for two casual work dinner/drinks and once with friends, and were well taken care of by Vincent and the team. It's my to-go place in the Craig Road and Tanjong Pagar area
5
I came to this place few days ago with couple of friends and It was a great suprise in Singapore!Lovely place, lively vibe, and great service from Ben and Vincent.Highly reccomended, ciao!Fabi
5
It was a great night. The atmosphere is vibrant and joyful (some may find a bit noisy), which brought me back to the good old days in Spain. Food was decent, good as simple tapas, to go with drinks. Service was very satisfying. Everyone was very professional and passionate. Just that some of you guys seem not very familiar with the whole menu though ;) but not a issue since they get back to us shortly. Finally they really made awesome cocktails! Only tried few but will definitely come back for more. P.s seems El Tardeo and Binomio belongs to the same company right? I prefer El Tardeo way more than Binomio ;)

Went to Tardeo as we were looking for a trendy, cool tapas place with authentic cuisine. We liked the place. The long bar, the set up, it's a cool place to go to. High tables and bar are perhaps better than sitting on tables. Order a bottle of wine, top of the list for less than 100$: Mas d'en Compte. I though I ordered a white wine and got a red wine. Never mind, tasted it and it was great, I did not think much of it till after diner when looking for a desert wine and noticed this wine comes in red and white! Hummmm!!! Still very nice red!The food was nice, some comes in big portions, not typical tapas bites. The mushroom was huge. I liked the baby squid, so soft. Overall a bit bland, the squid could have come with some back ink or chillis, instead of a very Belgium like mayonnaise. I was hoping for a more affirmed Spanish taste. May try next door, the more upmarket restaurant. The price overall was fine. With sparking water, an excellent wine, a fantastic old rum, 2 expressos and plentiful tapas for 250S$. Will return for drinks, not for food
5
This is my first visit to El-Tardeo and i'm impressed with the bartender service that this place has. They will enquire what would be your preferred spirit base or ingredients, and the bartender would proceed with creating a special concocted drink according to your liking. Truly amazing cocktails and deserved to be called a mixologist. Me & my friends had a great time with the friendly staff, though it was a short pre-dinner drinks. We will definitely return to try the food the next round.
5
I live just upstairs of this place and it's become one of mine and my friends' favorite places. The tapas are very reasonably priced and very good. There is wine for $7 a glass or $30-40 a bottle - you can't beat that in Singapore. The setting is casual and lively, great for a casual week night dinner with friends.Most things on the menu are good, my favorite is the goat cheese salad. Ox tongue, shrimps, squid croquettes, soft egg and short rib are also great. The only thing that I remember that wasn't amazing was the lamb shank. I haven't been to the Sunday brunch yet but looks like they have a $42 free flow option which is an amazing deal. Will definitely check it out sometime
3
I went to there with my wife. It was slightly noisy to me. Food was nice but less volume hence I guess this is place to drink.
4
Good time there! There isn't a huge menu, but I also think that's good. The drinks were the highlight. The bartender/mixologist definitely knew his/her stuff. We will be back!
5
The food was wonderful! Excellent service as the staff went out of their way to help. Highly recommended!
4
Muy buen bar de tapas en Singapur a muy buen precio. El personal encantador. Muy recomendables las croquetas de calamar en su tinta.
Very good spanish tapas bar in Singapore for a fair price. Lovely staff. Don't forget to try the Squid ink croquetas.
4
Love the vibe and ambience. Staff were super friendly and attentive.We ordered a btl of white and red along with some tapas for our dinner. Wines were terrific.Garlic shrimps - good Pork belly - melts in your mouth terrific Octopus - a tad too salty and dry Ox tongue - wonderfully seasonedRib eye - great marbling Definitely a keeper. Can't wait to bring more friends to this lovely joint.Muy bueno
2
Went to El Tardeo based on TripAdvisor good reviews but it has been quite a disappointing culinary experience. The menu is short which is good but tapas are not tasty - and expensive considering the lack of savors. What a bad surprise to get industrial French fries served as patatas bravas ("El Little"), and the dish was definitely too salty. Guacamole seasoning was quite tasteless. But the place has really a good atmosphere and the service is excellent
5
The best Tapas in Singapore so far, full of flavor in just one bite. Can't go wrong with the COJONUDO. The atmosphere and service are excellent too. Highly recommended
5
I've been to El Tardeo over numerous occasions for dinner and drinks and it's become somewhere very familiar and that I always look forward to returning to. Firstly, the ambience is both warm and friendly. It is easy to have both celebrations with large groups, or a quiet chill evening to wind down and have private conversations over delicious food and drinks. The service is impeccable. Vincent, Ben and their team are organised, thoughtful and always put the extra effort into making the visit both welcoming and comfortable. Their attention to detail is definitely noticed and appreciated where they will be happy to engage in conversation or give diners privacy. The food is amazing and Chef Carlos never fails to surprise and put together pintxos and tapas that I always enjoy. Some favourites include the ox tongue, patas bravas, squid croquettes and of course their tortilla patata. He also makes it a point to come out of his kitchen and make sure diners are enjoying their food, or to ask about their their experience. El tardeo is not to be missed!!
5
It's not like they sell any possum, but even if they did, I bet it will taste divine like all the dishes I tried. I like that the portions are not that large so it gives me more dishes to try.The friendly staff, Vincent, Benedict and team, all made the whole experience even more enjoyable. I have been there like almost every week and at times twice a week. Perhaps I am bias cause it's just a stone's throw away from where I live
5
A family dinner evening at El Tardeo turned out to be so amazing!! Food was simply amazing! The squid ink croquettes were to die for..and so was everything else we ordered! We liked the simple but elegant decor of the place and the positive vibe. Service was of the highest quality
5
Have a wonderful time.. The staff give me a warm feeling with their smiles and service.. Specially Vincent, Sly and Ben..
5
We had a wonderful time in El tardeo!Upon entry, we were greeted by the warmest smiles. The decor of the place is modern with subtle Spanish features. The crowd was a good mix of expats and locals. We started off with a bottle of tempranillo which was under 40 dollars(if i recall correctly) and we had the some cheese and cold cut meat. The pairing was impeccable. We saw that they had a pretty good selection of spirits and liqueurs and requested for their cocktail menu. The cocktail was innovative and tasty. I personally like that you could request for a bespoke cocktail according to your flavour profile. Just tell the bar keep you're looking for and watch the magic happen!Food wise I'm no expert on Spanish crusine but I'll say they're pretty good. We had plates after plates of tapas!Service was fast and polite even when it started to get crowded around 8.30. The waiter was attentive and constantly check up on our needs. I'll highly recommend the reasonable wines and their creative cocktails 
5
Went there with my gf for dinner. Beautiful place, well decorated. Huge selection of food and beverage available for the diners. They have a gin tonic menu available as well. Different gins pair with different garnish and tonic, that is really amazing. The food are really really great for the price we are paying. This place is a must for visit
4
Spent an evening with couple of friends. Food was very good and there is a large variety of tapas on the menu. Wine was very good as well and I would say amazing to find nice wine at a very reasonable price.It's definitely a good address and we'll go back.
5
Great classic Spanish tapas in a very friendly atmosphere. The wine menu offers a good choice of Spanish wines from all the regions, and reasonably priced. Really worth a visit for a simple apero or for lunch and dinner. Booking advisable as it can get quite busy.
5
As a Spaniard living in Singapore, I can say that this is the best Spanish tapas bar in the city. Actually, I have been there several times since they opened, a few months ago. When you enter the place, you start to feel like in Spain. The tapas are absolutely Spanish with a modern touch. Spirit drinks are poored into those kind of balloon gin & tonic glasses or the one that fits better whatever the drink or cocktail you order. Bartenders are very professional. Spanish vermouth, wines and beer. The atmosphere, lightning and music will make you wish to stay after the meal for a "sobremesa" time (Sobremesa: the time you spend after the meal having a drink and chatting, an meal stage very typical in Spain). In addition, the friendly staff will make you feel like at home. A must
5
Nice Tapas bar serving delicious tapas food at reasonable prices. We tried out a few dishes recommended by the staff and they did not disappoint. my favourite was the ox tongue. The service here is impeccable. We were promptly seated when we entered with a friendly smile. And throughout the meal, the service staff never fail to clear our plates and refill our wine glasses regularly. Thumbs up for their good customer service.Will be back again soon
3
For this who have not been in Spain a good place. Personally, I think service was very average food nice and tasty but nothing from the other world. Good for Singapore since here Western food us extremely expensive
5
El Tardeo has the best service in Singapore! The first time I went to El Tardeo I had low expectations, only because service is Singapore isn't very good when you compare it to Australia, or any other place. We were seated promptly, sat with menus and water straight away, drinks and food came out quickly. And the staff were super attentive, noticing when our plates were empty and clearing them as quick as they could, noticing if our drinks were almost finished and asking us if we would like another refreshment.The service at El Tardeo is on point. The prices are very reasonable, especially for Singapore. I love the ambiance of the venue and the music. No wonder the venue is busy all the time. I will be frequenting this venue
4
Be greeted with the energy and spirit of the service staff when you come by. Sit at the cocktail bar counter if you have the choice to get all the action. This little casual tapas bar has been my regular haunt since it opened. I have known Chef Carlos from Binomio and have found the dishes very reasonable and creative. Some of my favorites are the Calamari, Potato Bravas, Octopus, Gambas, Croquetas and Wontons. The menu changes regularly, but it'll be authentic and original. Nothing too off the beaten track.
5
Nice set up with good ambience, drinks and tapas!!
Definitely a place to go for a visit if you around the area.
5
Amazing Place !!! Such friendly service. Food was excellent, as was the drink. Highly recommend it to anyone, we went as a couple as well as in bigger groups. Always a great experience.
5
Have been coming here for drinks and I love this place! Service is good and I love Vincent! He is able to understand what I want in my drinks and I am never disappointed. I would swing by again to try their food!
4
Nice little tapas bar with great staff. If you're new to the cocktail scene these start at $16 and if you do't know what to order Vincent or Ben will whip you up something extraordinary - try the espresso martini for size. Beer lovers will enjoy happy hour: $10 for 600ml from 6pm to 8pm every Tuesday to Saturday and Cava is a very reasonable $39++ (that about 17% tax in Singapore). Tapas selection is delicious, very reasonable and the squid ink croquettes and asparagus tempura are must tries
5
Such a unforgettable experience in this restaurant for the new year countdown, great team and excellent service. food and drinks are super nice as well. I will definitely recommend this place to my friend
5
Highly recommend place for drink & meal. Delicious food, refreshing cocktails .. Professional & excellent service. Well done all the crew, Vincent. Keep it up !
5
I went there for drinks and tapas. The bar staff were very attentive and were able to suggest me drinks based on my preferences. Very interesting experience, and it was a trip to have such customised service from experienced hands
5
Was Christmas weekend so a bit slow. But the food was fantastic and probably the best mixologist we have come across in Singapore. Would recommend any night.
5
El Tardeo is definitely the place to go if you needed somewhere to chill out after work and having nibbles of food with couple of friends to end the night.They serve excellent and cheerful spanish tapas at a reasonable price but great quality!Not forgetting the good drinks & cocktails as well, they have extensive affordable red, white and sparkling wines! All the criteria of a good tapas bar are met; casual atmosphere, good food, good wines and reasonably priced.Service Crew is awesome too! expect the most friendly service from a young and professional team that you could ever find
3
Tried the paella ($30) which is only available for brunch....well, was surprised by it am still looking for my paella The pintxos are ok, service is great
5
El Tardeo was the highlight for our night. They have awesome spanish food, excellent cocktails and have the most passionate team of bartenders around~ definitely a must-go-to restaurant
5
A place that can turn my bad day into a better one.
"Star"tender -Mr Sly always professionally handle my demanding request. Try out their "Kelly Sour" , it can bring you to paradise.
5
Good place for catching up with friends gathering. Most important, friendly, professional service crew & manager. Awesome!!! Keep it up guys for your great service and food!
5
Went there with my friends to have a pre-Christmas celebration. 3 of us had a good time!! We went there on Tuesday and took advantage of their free flow cava (6pm-8pm). The sparkling wine that they serve is light and sweet. We end up ordering another bottle after the free-flow ended at 8pm. We ordered 8 different type of food to share (include 2 main course, 2 dessert and others according to their staff recommendation). All are nice but we particular loves the shrimp, pork cheek and ribs.
5
One of my fav bar/restaurant, their food and drinks are definitely good, no disappointment ( to me) . The team is friendly and warm, love all of them. 
5
If there is one place to visit on a weekly basis, El Tardeo is my top one on the list. Vincent and Ben and all other bartenders are superduper friendly and funny. Here you don’t have to order from the menu, just talk to them and tell them what kinda drinks u want, and they will make just the perfect cocktails for you. It’s perfect for after work chilling, ladies nightout, hot date, post dinner hangout, pre-party warm up etc etc. Food is superb as well, Spanish and all
4
El Tardeo serves up some honest-to-God authentic Spanish food in an incredibly cozy atmosphere and the most unbelievably cheerful service staff you will find for this price range (my bill came up to a pretty affordable $25/pax). Generous portions of mouthwateringly good food, complemented by some fantastic wine, ensure that you will leave El Tardeo feeling more than satisfied
5
For a new restaurant the team is really putting a lot of effort. The restaurant is very big Running by 5 people. Staff is not easy but can see they are doing their best to take care of the guest. Chef Carlos also came out and talk to us checking is everything is ok. Thank you so much El Tardeo team. Sometimes what we are looking for is the quality of the people working there rather then over the quality of the food or drinks. Keep up the hard work
5
Went with one other friend to celebrate her birthday and when the staff found out, they all came up to her at own time to give her a birthday wish! It was very interesting since most singaporean companies would not have done that.The food was absolutely amazing, the mini burgers was fantastic, the prawns were delicious and the crema catalana was sinful! While the resident chef, Carlos was not around, his able assistant, Simon did a stunning job with making sure all the food was on point. Service was excellent, the bartenders were funny and a great help in crafting a new drink for my friend when she couldnt decide. The wednesdays' one-for-one drink for ladies was a pleasant surprise and gave us some leeway to try more drinks then we intended. Great job to the amazing team at El Tardeo, I'll definitely be back for more! :

Warm service and good vibes in this buzzy watering hole. It was packed on a Tuesday evening and it was a good place to end the work day.

This is a great place to chill out over drinks and tapas. The atmosphere is casual and fun, the food was great, cocktails were excellent and most of all, the service is excellent! Bar manager Vincent was ever so attentive and friendly. We went there on a Wednesday evening which happens to be ladies night - one for one cocktail, ahoy! And a good selection too. Will definitely be back for more

The friendly manager Vincent made us customized cocktail drinks according to our taste and preferences. The drinks were delicious and very reasonably priced. It's a casual place to hangout and have nibbles that are great tasting as well

Great place to go to after work for drinks and food. Food was A M A Z I N G! Came down after work with a friend and we decided to sit at the bar and ordered some tapas. Not a huge fan of shrimps but the Gambas Ajillo (garlic shrimps) was delicious!! We also had the patatas bravas which was sensational. The Head Chef Carlos even came out to check if everything was alright. Service was Great. From the time we entered and sat down to the time we stood up to left. they made us feel comfortable and at home.Ambiance was excellent, everyone around us looked like they were having a good time as well. Thank you to el tardeo team for the wonderful dining experience.

I visited El tardeo with my wife and friends for food and drinks. From the moment we came inside the place we had a wonderful feeling. You will be greeted by the staffs with lovely smile. We decided to have our drinks at the bar top. The managers Vincent and Ben was very accomadating, friendly and was a faultless blend of knowledge, personality and service! Look for Sly and he will make you the most amazing cocktail you will ever had and his very professional. The food was out of this world! I highly recommend this place and definitely will always come back. Thank you El Tardeo for the amazing experienced

Wonderfully fun, talented and entertaining mixologists who can whip up super-delicious cocktails! Food is fantastic as well - definitely a place you would want to keep going back!

On my last visit I forgot to make a booking for a bday party I was organising... I am so thankful on how the guys at El Tardeo helped me sorted it out with such a short notice... we were talking of almost 30 pax! The night was awesome, service was amazing and I am glad my friend loved her bday as everyone else invited.. Thanks Vincent, Pauline and Ben

Food and drinks are alright, I felt an air of arrogance from the staff from this establishment. Not friendly. Manager forgot my dessert, well I paid for it but won't return

Found it loud, lacking in service and the food mediocre. Our waiter was deciding for us, but not really listening to our dislikes so it seemed like an argument. Once again, servers who think they can impress me with their memory often forget something we ordered, and this was no different. Didn't bother asking for the item since we wanted to leave. It is more of a bar setting than a restaurant, so if you're looking for something quiet and relaxing, go elsewhere. The drink list was impressive, but there are so many better tapas places in Singapore.

Was introduced to this bar by a friend, firs impression was fantastic! Service staff and bartenders were extremely warm and friendly. Very nice personal touch. They welcomed us at the entrance and introduced themselves. I like how they treat each and every guest like family/friends. The ambience is amazing! Simple yet cozy. Bartenders know their stuff and their recommendations we're fantastic! Kudos to Sly, Vincent, Benedict and all the service staff!! A night well spent!I highly recommend this bar to all who just want to pamper themselves with wonderful drinks and good food

we went here with friends on a saturday night and had a blast. Great food.. the starters are fresh and yummy. The sangria was not the best I had but okay but loved the vibe. Service with a smile and most importantly great pricing for the quality of food and location

Love this place!! I attended the grand opening where everything went for $2/3 and have since been back a couple of times. Food is really good and at prices that can't be beat in Singapore. They also have daily special cocktails that are at great prices as well
5
Had a fabulous night sitting at the bar as we didn't make a booking - absolutely no problem as it's more fun up there watching the passionate bar tender - Sly, mix his delicious cocktails and Gin & tonics. We ordered 6 or 7 dishes and I can highly recommend the fish with eggplant and the potato waffle with bravos sauce. We drank 4 different gins out of around 20 with there matched garnishes. We let it slip that it was our honeymoon and generously and thoughtfully received a little chocolate cake and when we were done we all shared a whiskey sour shot. We had the best night there and I can recommend this as a fun night out with interesting drinks and tasty food.

Love the food! I had the Oxtail sandwich. It was delicious. I love the garlic mayonnaise (I asked for extra) which really enhanced the oxtail. And one cannot go wrong with the papadas de cerdo (not sure how to translate that...pork neck?). Oh so very fatty and yummy :) Great service and ambience to hang out the whole night
5
Good Cocktail & Food !!! This place Sunday(12:00pm-6:00pm) also open!!! Friendly staff Good hospitality I'm very fun this place !!

Great place to chill out after a hard day's work. I loved the ambiance and loved the drinks even more. Bartenders were knowledgeable about their craft and wiped up some pretty good drinks based on my preference. Will go back again!

El-Tardeo has been one of my favourite hangout places ever since my first visit. With its cozy ambience and friendly staff, it is definitely the place that you would like to stay for long throughout the night and keep going back for more. Not to mention, the very attentive bartenders who will custom-mix your cocktails specially to your liking and never once you won't like it! And, they remember you and your favourite liquor the next time they see you ! A wonderful night out and fabulous drinks won't be complete without tasty yummilicious food to pair with ! The Iberian Pork Belly,Patatas Bravas, Gambas Ajillo and the Soft Boiled Egg with potato puree and mushrooms are the MUST-TRY! Thanks to Chef Carlos and his team who have been working tirelessly in the kitchen to make sure that the food served on the table taste awesome!Oh did i forget to mention that they have a great deal for ladies night on Tuesday (free flow of wine from 6-8pm) and Wednesday (1 for 1 cocktails)! Check it out ! El-Tardeo is definitely a place that you don't wanna miss !

I'm a person that love believe that the world would not be complete without the invention of the proper mix of gin & tonic. Here at El Tardeo, have more than 20 variety of GIN selection, some of the worlds great choices. Sly Foo, the well-dressed and good looking professional bartender, to educate me about El Tardeo g&t concept. Fully knowledgeable about he's product and able to serve you (me) every different gin pair with different garnishes. Hard to believe, the little things that make different in someone's dining experience. Great way to start my evening. Added to my experience, the tapas style food menu. Each dishes are perfectly portion for individual meal or as a sharing for group of friends. SERIOULSY, WORTH THE PRICE !! I ordered my food two dishes at the time, as I slowly sipping on my g&t in whole new level of experience, the Bartenders are ready to customise any cocktails that suit my palate. I can't wait myself to go back to El Tardeo again ! Not to forget, my special thanks goes to the entire team. Chef Carlos, Vincent, Ben, Jude, and of course, Sly Foo.Thank you El Tarde

One word to describe El tardeo, awesome. I had never been to a bar that treats all customers with so much hospitality irregardless you're a new customer or a returning customer. They serve awesome and good food which are also accompanied by a wide variety of wines and cocktails to choose from. A cocktail lover's place to go as the bartenders at El tardeo put in their 101% effort to mix your drink. Be awed at their remarkable showmanship while waiting for your drink to be served. The staff there are all well dressed which displays their professionalism at work. If you haven't been to El tardeo, it's time for you to go and enjoy your night with the fun and awesome people at El tardeo:

There are many establishment around the Tanjong Pagar/Duxton Enclave, but we love to come to El Tardeo because of the combination of service, food (and drinks!) and atmosphere, this is not easy to come by.Service staff is friendly, helpful and always have a point of view and you must try. I am sure we've been to many places where the staff will just give you a blank look and go "well you can try anything, they are all nice". What i also like however is that the staff knows when to leave you alone for conversations with friends, and also when to drop by to check on you. Vincent does this really well!Food here delish and doesn't cost much. It was pintxos, but now there's a good mix. I really this soft egg dish, and the patatas dish. Drinks are great value too as others have said.It is really the atmosphere that got me sold. It has a dynamic busy vibe that's perfect for a Friday, Saturday out with good friends to make merry and have a good time. Am almost a regular and will continue to be so

Went to this new Spanish place and was really blown away with their personable service. The food was very yummy, you just feel like having more! and is very reasonably priced. The cocktails are really 'delicious' too. A very nice cozy place to hangout with friends! Will be back
5
If you want a place that doesn't just put up a show for making drinks but actually makes them real good, this is the place to be. You get the best crew that makes the most polished drinks that are more than value for your money. A grand manager, crew, good showmanship skills and awesome drinks! One cannot ask for more
