...and excellent Guo Tiek or dumplings. Quality of the Xiao Long Bao can easily match those in the more expensive restaurant - the skin is thin and the filling is perfectly bursting it's juice once bitten. The bad thing (or good, depends on perspective) is the long queue. But you'll get rewarded with awesome affordable gems.

If xiao long bao are the Rolls Royce of the dumpling world, the Toyota must be the pan fried dumplings here in Alexandra Village Food Centre. They’re usually the reason for massive queues.Sporting a thicker, chewier wheat dough, these little vibrant bullets of pleasure with their generous filling of succulent pork, come with a healthy slick of grease from their crispy, irresistible bottoms. The filling LITERALLY explodes with pork juices, but the sturdier wrapper holds up to some serious pan-frying. Best appreciated with chilli and vinegar, they’re cheap and by default, cheerful.Dig into these babies as soon as they arrive — it’ll be well worth the scorched tongue.This is the true truth as I say it as it is

Seems there are quite a few eateries featuring xiao long bao, a Shanghainese specialty, but the owners are not from Shanghai and the food is not exactly authentic. Maybe they are just trying to capitalize on the popularity of Ding Tai Fung.The quality of food offered here is not bad and there is always a queue but I do have a small issue with the attempt of the imitation game here. The lack of authenticity affects the reputation of xiao long bao, probably the most famous export of Shanghainese food now ..
