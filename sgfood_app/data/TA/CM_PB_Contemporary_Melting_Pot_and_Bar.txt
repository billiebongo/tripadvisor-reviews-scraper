We came with a group of 9 and yet, we didn't feel crowded and enough arm space for all. Service was efficient and beer was cold. The pizza was interesting since it came in super thin crust and crispy.

Fushion food.... pizza was great!
like the clams most.
would have been better if chairs are more comfortable.
4
All the restaurants and shops are fantastic here, this one included. Nice little patio area that you can smoke on. Also had a nice happy hour.

Visited this restaurant for a wine pairing dinner - I was more impressed with the wine than the food.
The servings were generous but the lamb and beef were of average quality while the salmon was too salty.
Unlikely to revisit soon.

Set within the ex-pat Dempsey Hill, this bar is a super place to chill, drink and hang out on thr patio. Typical bar food but decent drinks. Plenty of choices in the area but i just like this spot. Would highly recommend.

this little restaurant has been around for a few years now. since Dempsey Hill became popularised. I remember the days where friends and myself will meet there for drinks on weekends. revisited this place recently for lunch. it's quieter now compared to yesteryears but still holds its own charms. the servings of the food is value for money. maybe it's me getting older and appetite getting smaller, but the fungi truffle pasta is rich in flavour. definitely tasty.worth visiting again in the afternoon if you wanna skip crow

Its a good place to dine and have good time with friends. Service was good, food were great. Only its not accessible with people like me without car. Its like a 10-15 mins hike up and down, to and fro the nearest bus stop. Visited this place thru a friendâ€™s recommendation. It was a good decision to check it out. Value for money and perfect place to chill.
4
Visited this placed for a couple times at night for some drinks. The only dish which I have tried is the clams soup with bread without cream. It's amazing! Pretty chill except that on Saturday night, they have a live band in the house and I find it alittle noisy.
3
We really liked the ambience at this place and we love that we made it in time for happy hour. The service was good and were we're seated and served with water in no time. We had and wagyu pizza which I loved though my husband thought it was very greasy. The Burrata salad was very good too. Looking forward to going back and trying something else from the menu.
4
We've been here twice, the first time for light meals and drinks and the latest just for beers. It is a walk in type of venue with plenty of seating indoor and out including covered tables on a terrace and uncovered high and low tables with a garden feel. We appreciate the fast service. I would have reviewed it sooner but the name is so odd I couldn't remember it! Personally I'd just call it the End Bar, because that's where it is in the row of Dempsey barracks buildings. Whilst it does not have as much passing trade, it is always well patronised to our observation. So others must agree with our views. Solid.
5
place is pretty chill, especially in the evening time when there is a live band playing inside. decent food and service, and they give out free soup sometimes for the alkies!
5
Just grabbed a set lunch, the Caprese salad was super generous. As a cheese lover it was just heaven. The Chili Crab linguine is out of this world. Wolfed the whole plate down in minutes. Perfect lunch location.
3
We were the on the rainy Thursday evening. It was`t too crowdy. The service was quick and helpful. Relaxed atmosphere. I had pulled pork burger (love that) and my husband beef burger.
5
I was here with my wife for lunch. The menu was rather limiting. There wasn't many main dishes for us to pick. I had a steak burger which took quite a long time to be served. But I must say the bun was one of the best ever tasted. The bun bread melts in my mouth. It is very fragrant too. The green, including the onion, were exceptional sweet. The mushroom soup was also very tasty. In short, while the selection is limited, they didnot disappoint. And I do like the ambient. Being nested within the grown trees at the corner of the whole restaurant belt, dinning outside is what i love most

The restaurant is located in Singapore's fashionable dining spot, the Dempsey Hill. It is fairly easy to find, easy to book a table, but when it came to "claiming" our reservation, they couldn't find anything reserved under my name, even though it was done a few days in advance, and the person on the phone repeated my name and phone number many times. Beautiful interior, relaxed atmosphere, and waiters. The waiters were too relaxed, as if hibernating... the order had to be repeated a few times, and reconfirmed, and it took a long time to process... After examining the menu we went for the day's specials which included Mozarella and tomato salad, Spaghetti Chili Crab, variety of drinks. The portions are very big, the dishes are very well prepared, and maybe I was supposed to mention to go easy on the chillies in Chilli Crab...because my stomach was on fire for the next few days after that! But the food was good, and we will definitely come back again! Good selection of wine, good music, spacious, not too noisy, plenty of space indoors and outdoors

When you've got the wonderful location that this place has AND the great, colonial feel that the building and verandah allows, it's a shame the food has to be so ordinary!!Having brunch on a Sunday, the sausages were heavily processed and tasted terrible (and Hubers Butcher is only 150m away!!!) and the rest of the plates were tasteless and uninspired. Given all the things this place has going for it, getting a decent Chef and revamping the menu has to be a no-brainier. Might go back for drinks....won't be eating there again
2
Wanted to try something new but was very disappointed by CMPB which could really use a new chef. Ordered a bunch of tapas...very average and sent back the patatas with a horrible tomato sauce to only find it on the bill later. The waitresses are very nice and on top of their game, however, I will never go back as there are much better alternatives
1
Went here with friends and family. Waiter brought menu for 3 out of the five of us. When he took our order he forgot my wife's mother. Too much more to note but he did not care. The food came out was cold. Terrible place, nice dÃ©cor but rubbish staff. the food and service just does not warrant paying $ Sing 24 for a breakfast plat
2
Starting with the good, the food was ok and fairly priced somewhat. We ordered few items and wanted them ALL delivered at the same time ... which was repeated three times to the service guy but ended up being impossible. The steak then came without salt and pepper and just arrived after I had half of it (before it gets cold). This is a problem of uneducated or unexperienced service stuff, at least provide a general training ... this is what people pay for as well. If you go to McDonalds you get it all at the same time at least. Even after complaining they didn't say a word. Won't come back here and won't recommend to anyone.

I went here for lunch earlier today. They seemed to have a good array of brunch type food, burgers and pizzas.Overall, I was unimpressed with the food and particularly the service.I ordered a fairly simple lunch with a sprite and a burrata pizza.The sprite took 15-20 minutes to arrived and it turned out to be from a carbonated 'gun'. For $7, I would have expected a can/bottle.A further 20 minutes later, my pizza arrived. The cheese on it was regular mozzarella, but certainly not burrata! The taste was ok, although when it arrived, I asked for some black pepper and chilli oil if they had it. 10 minutes later, when I had finished the bulk of my pizza, I asked for the 3rd time for black pepper and chilli oil and they were eventually brought. Given that the restaurant was pretty much empty, the delays and poor service was pretty poor. Inaccurate descriptions on the menu are simply misleading.I would not recommend visiting this place

Ambience is fantastic.
Music is great.
Food is good.
Their waffle - a must-try!
Service is prompt!
They offer free soup after a certain timing. Nice little gesture!
4
Went there for my new year day's breakfast after being introduced by my colleagues after a lunch.
Tried their truffle fries, Wagyu beef cubes, mussels and clams pots and their breakfast dishes.
Food is good and price is also good!
2
Went there for lunch. Food is so so at best (but not at cheap price at all). We had pasta for lunch.
Won't be on my list of lunch place anymore in the near future.
4
Had a great brunch with friends food is great was within walking distance to various shops and markets its was a great place to eat and enjoy the outside dining space
Very affordable and casual dining as well

I came here to meet up with some friends and we sat at the outdoor section of the outlet. It was very comfortable and cooling. The place was very relaxing and the crowd was mainly locals. They played some pop music over the speakers and the volume was very pleasing to the ears.We ordered fried fish sticks and fried calamari. Unfortunately, they tasted like frozen food and lacked taste.I ordered a mojito which was very diluted. Our bottle of Argentinian Malbac wine also lacked body and tasted zesty
4
Great ambience and good music. Drinks and food menu fairly extensive. Food is a mixture of Western and Asian. They also have Japanese dishes ie sashimi but we didn't order that. Starters were tasty especially the beef cubes. The flambe'ed prawns were only average. Tasty but prawns could be a bit fresher. Margherita pizza was very good and cheesy. Service was fairly good when the restaurant was quiet but got a bit slow later on. They could have been short staffed. I would go back.
3
Went there in a group around 10pm. Sat at one corner to chat over a drink and some snacks. The truffle fries were not bad but the chicken wings were too salty. Fortunately the place was good for us to chill. Also we were given complementary hot red bean soup(without the beans though
4
Situated in a former army camp that has transformed into an enclave of expensive restaurants, hip cafes, shops and spas, this restaurant is a great blend of cool sophistication and chill... Upper middle without having to be stiff or dressed to the nines. The ambience is excellent, and the service is attentive but not intrusive. The food is above average, and I love the truffle fries. The drinks all come quite small though. This place is on the expensive side, but the free parking sort of negates that. Anyway, the ambience more than makes up for it.
1
Music was loud in the restaurant so most people sat outside. There were approx 10 tables or more occupied but we could only see 1-2 service staff waiting on the tables. It was a long 15-20 mins before our drinks order were taken and another 10 mins before we could get anybody's attention for the bill. Never been here, never will again
4
We ate here because it wasn't too crowded on a Sunday at noon - not usually a good sign, but very pleased we did - the eggs benedict were super, and the waffles were very tasty. Coffee was OK. And we were kept supplied with drinking water (very welcome after cycling). It looks like it could get quite lovely at night. A big, well-stocked bar and lots of places to sit. We ate outside in a no smoking area, but out front is also a smoking area. The non-brunch menu looked like the usual suspects, but we would try if we ever found ourselves here in the evening because of the standard of brunch.Service was efficient, though it particularly friendly
4
Gr8 variety of food. From local, Japanese, western to fusion. Indoor and outdoor seating available. Was surprised by live band performance on Friday night.
1
Went with family on Saturday 14th March. Got REALLY bad service. Complained at restaurant. No remorse.
4
Just visited again recently. Place is still at its best not to mention the good food and the drinks they offered. Just thought that the place could be better if the staffs were slightly friendlier.
3
average mish mash of food. the live music is absolutely horrible. they sing dower mopey songs. great for a friday night *eyeroll*
4
location - dempsey areapremise - quiet lunch time crowd + major downpourstaff - no change to same good level of service as beforefood - had lunch this time, LOVED the CMPB salad. VERY NICE!!!!!!! the squid ink marinara however.... can be made better i feel. the marina sauce was too overpowering, I guess, it would have been better had we requested it more Aglio Olio styled.crowd - not many to comment on but tai-tais were there...verdict - of cos go there again la.....
3
Called in on Sat night, just for a cocktail. Good location, lots of greenery, good music too. Menu was not bad so decided to have dinner....We ordered a starter to share...and a main each. Sadly they all came together, which seemed weird.Also, the cocktails, though tasty, were more ice than drink...AND the cost of wine was totally extortionate.An ok night, but nothing exceptional
4
On a Tuesday night there were more occupied tables than I had expected. Service was brisk and friendly. We sat at a table outdoors by the side - pleasantly cool and quieter than indoors. There was no live band on a Tuesday night. The finger food we ordered were decent - spam fries and onion rings. Crispy and tasty. There was a good selection of drinks and the pear cider was delightful! There's an ongoing promotion for pear cider on the UOB credit cards at $6 a bottle. I will be back

I am one of these people that almost always miss happy hour! Here they have very generous happy hour times that make almost any visit happy hour! So that made all the drinks more attractively priced. A great range of drinks too, good choices of beers and wine. We shared four dishes amongst three people and loved them all. The restaurant knew we were sharing and even cut the hamburger for us. The cheese board had a unique tasty cheese selection with immaculate presentation and ample quince paste. The piza with prosciutto was well presented and very delicious, certainly no ordinary pizza! The waygu beef cubes, despite being super tender and tasty I suspect were not waygu, but who knows, they were brilliantly prepared and presented. All food was served in a timely manner, with glasses of water regularly refilled and wine glasses also topped up at appropriate times. Very pleasant visit
2
It used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Singapore, but it's service and food has taken a sharp nosedive in recent months. The waiter ignored us even though only 3 tables were occupied. We had to ask for the menu, the crockery and cutlery once the food arrived. Both the burrata salad and the steak sandwich came with untoasted stale bread. Extremely disappointing
4
location - Dempsey so take a cab or car or walk in for about 10 minutes. ample free parking.premise - all the way but with a huge open air fanned area and smoking is allowed - KA CHING!!! not hot on sunny days. indoor is also huge and pleasant.service - with a smile and professionalism. not 'coloured' specific service quality - fair treatment. this is RARE now.food - i had the steak with eggs.... i wanted more! the portion was good and satisfying. the rosti with sausage was just as good and so was the big breakfast. coffee was normal.crowd - families, friends. night crowd is more... you know.... the 'bankers', 'traders', 'daddy bought me an R8' kind of crowd but still tolerable.verdict - brunch with family, coffee / tea / beer with friends and people hunt in evenings and nights with ease
3
We had drinks & dinner with in total 8 pax. The service was fast and friendly, however, they did not lower the music volume despite asking 3 times. Overall it is a nice place with good outdoot seating.
5
I was with mum here on lazy afternoon. We ordered Oyster w/Duo Dressing, CM-PB Salad, Brownie and Melon and Mangosteen Tea. The food was excellent. Service was great. Really enjoy!
4
Good snacks and sharing plates. Very yummy basic dishes like chilli and nachos, crab tacos were great, salt and pepper squid, wag you bites. All really good and a great selection of drinks. Very nice casual atmosphere.
4
The environment is just nice by th time I was there. Not so crowded, may be Monday night . Food and beer is up to standard.
4
Tables outside are away from the parking area in a courtyard. Lighting is nice and its a nice atmosphere. Menu is varied, cocktails good, on the pricey side but not too bad for Singapore. Service was average but I would come back because unlike most restaurants at Dempsey you don't feel you are eating in a car park

We came to this place in a group of 10. We were all sampling from each other's plates and I will just give some feedback about the food one by one.Wagyu Burger: Prepared well and the meet is obviously tender and juicy. I guess they did a very good job grilling it. The patty was thick and just the right size for the bun. Tenderloin: Disappointing in size but it was very good but obviously you can't compare it to some of the big steak players like Morton. Fried Rice: Coming from Indonesia this would be considered an ok on.. a 7/10.Spaghetti Aglio Olio with Crab meat: Awesome. Tasty. Couldn't finish the crab as it was a lot on top of the pasta.Grilled Chicken: Best Ive ever had. I think Singapore has much better chicken than Indonesia. Its juicy and tender. (even the local Hainan chicken is bigger and juicier then anything in Indonesia)Spam Fries: A little over the top portion wise consider its such a heavy food we couldn't even finish it. But pairing it with Japanese Mayo was yumâ€¦. I couldn't figure out what kind of oil they deep fry it in as it has a very nice scent. I can't seem to remember the other dishes. But again it was a very nice meal and I would recommend this place if you are visiting Demsey and want an all around menu for a big group. There should be something for everybody here
2
OK, we didn't order immediately, we took our time, but that didn't mean that they tried to serve our three shared starters along with our main courses. Actually, it took over 40 mins for our starters to arrive. And then another long pause before our main courses arrived.This slow service let down the quality of the food served and the location
3
On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate the food as 6. The service is good but the place was half empty when I was there. For a place that serves various alcoholic beverages they close their last order quite early. it gives the ambiance of a bar but it would have been better if they extend their services up to the wee hours of the night. In general the place is fine but for the price you pay I think there is room for a lot of improvement
4
We have been a couple of times to CM-PB and it has always produced reasonable quality food with reasonable service. It didn't disappoint this time either.We sat outside, which in Singapore at night time is normally fine. However, our group had to request for the fan to be switched down (and then off) as it made us freezing to the point that we were violently shivering.We had the salt and pepper squid and chicken wings to share (and there was a great amount of meat on the chicken) followed by the CM-PB burger, fish and chips and one of the pizzas. All were what you would expect.Reasonable value for money - the house wine is $50 per bottle.Do book - by 10.00pm there wasn't an empty table. The live band were also very good
4
It was quite hard to locate the restaurant for the first time walking ard dempsey but once we found a place to settle down, we love the place. It was in the afternoon with my girlfriend. We had a little bite of nachos and other snacks to go along with our usual drinks. Service was good. Always there but never intrusive. Food was wonderful. Huge servings. Its a place I would go to and unwind from the busy city
