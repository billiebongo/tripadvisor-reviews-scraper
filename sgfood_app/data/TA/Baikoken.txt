My "go to" place if I want a good ramen fix. My son and I ordered the Shoyu ramen with an egg as an extra whilst my daughter ate the char siew ramen (miso). Portions are generous and the soup hearty. We also ordered a plate of gyozas and a char siew don to share. All in a very satisfying meal.

It's always my favourite ramen since its first shop opened at North Canal road.Simple menu with three soup base, shoyu, shio and miso.My favourite is always vegetable shio ramen.Full flavour of pork bone with sea salt broth and specially picked cabbage, carrot and capsicum make your day wonderful

This ramen restaurant was originally located in boat quay but after that shift to takashimaya. It is located in basement 2 corner, the seating is a bit cramp so sitting down is a bit uncomfortable for me. The ramen as usual, tatse good and you will need to order and pay at the counter first before they will deliver to your table. There is a cup of water that served to you, waiting time is fast and there is no service charge so this is a good catch. Highly recommended to try

Baikoken, together with a slew of other Japanese eateries, is hidden in a corner of Takashimaya Food Hall in basement 2 of the department store. It's a simple, barrier-less set up (but make sure you're not seated in at another eatery's table. I had the cold ramen which came with 2 large pieces of pork, some mustard, and an assortment of shredded vegetables, omelette and jelly fish. The noodles, together with the jelly fish gave the dish a springy texture while the veges gave it crunch. Light, refreshing and hearty, it's really not bad

Was surprised when the bowl was served. The charsiew and everything else was piled up high atop the noodles. While digging , I realised I couldn't even get to the noodles yet, there was so much bean sprouts too! So kudos for the monster serving, but the taste was average. Also, not sure if there was too much miso or msg, but I was so thirsty after the mea

located in small corner in the taka food hall, this little restaurant serves a hokkaido style of ramen (although, probably localised..) vegetable portions are really generous, especially if you ordered the vegetable ramen. the sprouts and scallions and other vegetables are piled up so high, it'll take you awhile before you get to your noodles! the miso soup base comes with minced meat (not sure about the shio and shoyu ones), but so even the vegetable ramen is not vegetarian. loved the ajitama too, although it comes at additional cost. they have a loyalty card system, which is very quickly filled up.. gets you a free plate of gyoza or chasiew don. never tried the don, but the gyoza is not too bad, though not fantastic
