Definitely a cut above the ordinary. Some dishes and ingredients I’ve never seen on a menu before. Everything my wife and I ate was a wonderful taste sensation.

it is pricey ... unfortunately nothing special/stands out from the dishes we tried compared to other establishments in the red dot ... stick with the vegs and don’t bother with the desserts

This new restaurant is a gem - superb food, especially the fish starter. Super attentive staff, with a noticeably higher staff to tables ratio than at most Singapore restaurants. There is an upstairs bar, for the thirsty.

Did not quite meet expectations. Many hidden costs (tasting menu mandatory for bookings of min 6 pax). Also charged $20 cakage fee for a birthday cake (which we cut ourselves). All these without being told upfront when making reservations. Food was good but not fantastic.

Not exactly great.. lunch was average. Hit n misses. The blackmore wagyu was good. But the pork collar was disappointing. Bland n uninteresting. Squid was tender but portion was sml for the price. Dessert was totally a waste of time. The barley ice cream was so so..saved by the berries puree! Coconut sorbet was a let down. Din taste of fresh coconut cream. Wat i din get was coffee served in jap teacup.. it was impossible to hold as the drink was so hot. I almost drop the cup!Pls serve your coffee n tea in proper cups.. totally impractical!!Overall.. not recommende

Blackwattle serves modern Australian cusine & it's a good replacement for Zott's that had served Alpine cuisine for the past 3 yrs until it was closed down last yr. Probably best to come during lunch when it's less busy. The S$48++ 3-course lunch set is especially value for money. Good place to chill for a relaxing meal in the competitive Amoy/Club St, Telok Ayer area.

The tables are placed so closely together that I could hear the lovey dovey sweet talk of the couple next to me. I was sitting a mere 30 cm from the lady at the next table. It is old school canteen style seating. You can be sure that whatever you say to your guest can be heard by customers to your right and left. This is unfortunate as the restaurant is not charging school canteen prices. The meat main course are S$50-$60++. The portions are small. The taste were decent. Unfortunately, the price point is too high. When I first arrived, I asked the Maître D' whether I can have a corner table. He asked me whether I was a first time customer. I replied yes. He told me that the corner table was taken. That was at 7:15pm. When I left at after 8:45pm, the corner table was still empty. I am not sure what to make of it. I left disappointed. Most Maître D' will do their utmost to fulfill guests requests. Not this one. Most restaurants place their tables further apart (eg Rhubarb). Not Blackwattle. The price point which Blackwattle adopts does not justify the quality (average to slighty good) /quantity (very small portions) of food and the ambience (school canteen style seating). I will not be back

Came with anticipation of a tasty dinner. Came away disappointed.Ordered octopus, short ribs and brocalinni. Tye one Octopus tentacle was of average size and seasoning.The ribs were mostly fat. And brocalinni was , well, brocalinni.Service was lackluster, amateur. Wine by the glass was served like water, without even proposing for guestrooms taste, nor were the labels shown.Restaurant was half empty. Probably won't be here next December

After reading the reviews & to be honest, curious because of the hype, my friends & I decided to try this restaurant. We found it lacking in so many ways. First it was very cold inside. Second it seemed like they didn’t quite know what music to play & how loud it should be. It came on & off at different decibels during our meal. And sometimes not at all. Third the service was lackluster. The waiter forgot our wine. Then proceeded to offer a meat-based amuse bouche after specifically being told that one of the diners doesn't eat meat, just 10 minutes earlier. The lady manager looked like she didn’t want to be there & described our courses when she served them with such a bored face & tone, I almost asked if I could buy her a drink. But maybe I’m being pedantic. Let’s get on to the food. Amuse bouche cracker was tasteless & rather hard. Gooseberry in ginger broth was also bland. Aside from the tartness of the berries, the so-called broth tasted like ginger water. The stracciatella with mussels was pleasant enough. The halibut on pumpkin purée was also all right but nowhere near being a revelation on the palate. The beef was cooked to perfection but somewhat marred by the salty jus that accompanied it. To me the highlight was the dessert. A rich creamy tasty coconut ice cream topped with crispy lightly sugared apple slices, all on a bed of ginger flowers, only this time the ginger actually shone through. Pity that all the courses were not as inspired. Perhaps by this time I may be accused of having a not sufficiently refined enough palate to appreciate the delicate balance of what was offered. But as they say, whatever. At a $118++, there are many other options on this small island which are way better in taste, in service and in decor
