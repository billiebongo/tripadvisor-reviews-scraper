Crowded during peak hours, but the food quality stays the same. Very affordable choices and there is certainly something for everyone (except for vegetarians)
4
When we went there it was not that crowded, so no need to waited for long queue. I order the sirloin steak come with two side dish. The steak so tasty and juicy. Overall this western food is good, reasonable portion and worthy price.
3
Affordability priced western casual cuisine usually found in shopping malls.
Safe taste cooking. Nothing spectacular.
4
Had a really nice Prime Ribeye steak with french fries and coleslaw. Seems to be very popular also with local youngsters. Located at JCube shopping mall
3
Ordered the chicken chop and I have to say the quality of the chicken chop had maintain. Only issue I was the tasty rice side turn out to be only plain rice? Kinda disappointing.
5
Delicious selection of food at reasonable prices. Bit of a walk up to the restaurant as its on the upper floors, seems like mostly locals which makes it a hot local tip for us and a great find. Easily accessible all the same

Pretty decent place with sausages, ribs, pasta and chicken combos. The dining area is spacious, but the hold up is at the cashier/ordering area at the front, where indecisive people hold up the queue. You need to place your order before staff will lead you to a table.Food was not bad. We had the pork chops and bbq chicken, with sides of corn, baked beans, baked potato and slaw

We stumbled across Ashtons quite by accident and were so please we did. The menu is quite extensive, something for everyone, the cost is very reasonable and the service from the staff is excellent. Upon entering you choose the meat you want for your main, which comes with two side dishes of your choice, you then pay and are shown to a table, which if you are lucky overlooks the river, your drinks come and your food follows in no time at all. We went twice on our way over to the UK, a two night stop over, and once on the way back when we only had a one night stop over. No doubt we will go back when we are next in Singapore

We order 2 dishes: crispy fried chicken and prime ribeye w 2 free side dishes. But the veggie is overcook and the fried chicken also. The taste of chicken is just so burnt. The steak which they call "prime ribeye" is just very thin slice and very dry. Totally disappointed.

Someone recommended this place to me. So I skipped my regular spots and rushed to Astons (as they close at 10). I managed to reach just in time. I ordered the Black Pepper Chicken with a side of Mac & Cheese and BBQ beans. The order arrived 15 mins later and boy was I happy! For the price they charged the portions were huge! I dove right into the steak and I was blown away by how well cooked and flavorsome the steak was. It was unreal. And the sides were superb as well. Astons definitely goes right up my priority list for filling meals at affordable prices

Everytime I went to Cathay to catch a movie, Astons is the place I would definitely drop by to get their steak.
Personal favourite is New York Strip Medium Rare with 2 sides. Good Service with Great reasonable price Steak!
3
It's good value for money, as it's cheap and cheerful with ok steak and sides. Is not going to win any awards but it does the basics fine. Good student steak option.
4
I was at Bugis+ outlet...prepared to queue up but the waiting time is reasonable.
The steak and pork chop are good.
Staffs are friendly but the dining environment is quite noisy. There is a pub next to Aston.
Recommended but consider to try other outlet.
4
I had a wonderful time. I ordered Black Pepper Steak (medium well) w/ mac and cheese and potato wedges as side. Service was fantastic, it didn't take long for our orders to arrive. The food is delicious and pleasing to the eyes.
4
I visited Astons for lunch and tried the Grilled fish with herbs, with salad and potato wedges. Great meal indeed, well cooked and served nicely.
1
Ordered the Wagyu Burger for $18-00. It came on a plate with no chips, no sides, absolutely just the burger. Within the bun, one dried out, over-cooked piece of coarse meat(?) - could not recognise if it was beef, let alone wagyu, one slice of cucumber, once slice of tomato, both wilted. No butter on the dry as a bone bun. Took a couple bites, could not carry on, dinner ruined.
4
I love their set meal. You get one main course such as chared grill chicken, black pepper chicken or steak, and get to choose 2 other side dishes. I love their mac and cheese although the portion is rather small. However, the meal is generally affordable and great for students
4
A dinner for a friend's birthday was definitely delightful! I commend the helpful and cheerful staffs in this branch. Please keep it up!Get ready to get in line when you come for a meal from 7pm up. There's a load of people during this times.Had medium-well black pepper steak with baked potato and house salad and truly enjoyed it. The steak sauce is one of the best I had. We had spicy seafood marinara to share but nothing extra ordinary. The prices are decent for the serving size so it's value for money? Checked!Gonna visit next time for their "fisherman's pride" menu
4
With set meals of S$15.90 with 2 sides and main course of prime sirloin cooked to your required taste of medium rare, rare well done.The chargrilled chicken is very juicy and flavourfully marinated at S$9.90 yes $9.90 with 2 sides of fresh salad or potato salad or macroroni cheese.Lots of menu and beverages for you to choose and share.A good gathering for all before you board your plane at Changi airport.

It was my second visit at this branch with my friends and still enjoyed our dining experience, our orders came in quick and was very thankful as we were very hungry. I ordered the pork chop with corn on the cob and tasty rice for my dinner and root beer float as my pre-meal drinks. Staff was efficient, however they need to smile more and be more hospitable to create a better dining experience.
4
Good value for steak. Big portion. Good service. Avoid coming on peak hours, else you will be caught on queue.
5
Steak is juicy and tender. Fries is good. Staff is fast in service and food was served fast. I will dine here again in near future.
5
After going to many restaurants serving steak, I find astons still has one of the best steaks around. Helps a lot that it's affordable too. :)
4
My first time here and glad I came food is reasonable and pretty good.... The best part not to crowded so you can relax and enjoy.
5
I been to Astons at Changi airport many times and raffles plaza, Excellent service, Very tender steaks, Amazing prices especially for Singapore , A++
4
Foods are still amazing, but change of upfront payment and menu selection upfront seems to chase the customers to immediately finish the selection. Beside it seems to make the restaurant like a fast food restaurant
5
This Astons Specialties in branch is I liked the most but mind that all of their branches serve good food. However this one in Cathay is special due to its location and the ambiance of Restaurant. They serve affordable steaks and grills for delicious food and wonderful place. It is really worth your money
4
Reasonably priced. Good portion is large. We went to the Astons Specialities at Changi Airport. Queued for close to an hour before we got a table for three. We placed our order at a counter, paid and were then shown to our table. Main dish comes with a selection of sides. Food was served in a short time. Will be happy to eat there again if the queue is shorter
3
It is a popular place for young people and they serve value for money steaks. The queue can be long and the reason is that you place your orders at the cashier upfront. Unless you already know what the family is going to have, it will take a while. And I'm one of those who hates to be rushed to decide what to eat. And they are ever so eager to clear your plates even though you're not done with your meal. Go there for the value for money steaks and nothing else.
5
The last time we had Astons's was a couple of years back at the airport. This time we were again on a stopover in Singapore and was walking past Cathay when we spotted Astons and decided to step in. It was a great choice and restaurant was not that busy. Staffs were attention and efficient and food were promptly served. We had grilled pork and it was really delicious, juicy and just perfectly done with sides of vegetables. Not too big portion but just nice for a satisfying meal.Would definitely visit one of the Astons again when in Singapore
4
A great restaurant choice for reasonably priced Steak in Singapore. The quality of the meat was good and the service was friendly. Self service sides, salad and soup is a great addition to the steak.
4
Cheap chicken bbq steak ..you get to choose ur sauce..
Very delicious..will definitely come back..good for group of friends, hangout with officemates
5
on the 5th floor of this shopping mall we found astons that had steaks at a good price. but we were so please with their service especially from a young man called CLEMENT. we promised we would return before flying back to uk as we were so pleased with this place and quality of staff
4
Well I had one of my best meal at Singapore during my two week Stay. We (myself and one of my friend) went by accident to this place but we were extremely happy at the end of the meal. Had a Tiger Pint and the Combo of Chicken and Sausage with two sides. It is really VFM and had a great time. :)

I was at the Sports Hub yesterday, glad to find a new Aston restaurant at the new mall.We had to order our food and made payment at the front reception before we were usher to our seats. The restaurant is very spacious with cowboy theme deco.Food was as usual good, portion was reasonable. Definitely value for money
3
This is apparently a popular chain and always has long lines during dinner time on weekends. Especially with the teenagers. The main reason is that it's cheap, about $15-20 for a steak, and less than $10 for chicken or pork chopsYou order at the front and pay, before getting a seat. They served our drinks and they got my drink order wrong. The steaks came and i had the 1st bite. it wasn't any good (tough and you know it's a lousy cow), but edibleOverall, it's consistent with the adage "you get what you pay for". It's just like eating at mcdonald'

Astons Specialties Singapore serves western food at a budget price. I've eaten at several of their outlets - Cathay Singapore, Changi Airport, Resorts World Sentosa, Bugis - and find that the outlet at Changi Terminal 1 has the best ambience. Choose a seat near to the glass panel at the far end, and you will be rewarded with a view of, not only the action happening on the level below, but also of the airport area outdoors. At first impression, the restaurant looks like quite an expensive place to have a meal BUT it is not. Prices are highly affordable and portions are enough for those with an average appetite. Quality of food is quite good too for its price. It is not full service though, as one has to order and pay at the counter - although the food is served to the table. Overall, Astons is a relatively nice place to have a casual, no-frills meal that is easy on the pocket. There is a wide selection of western dishes to choose from and the restaurants are decorated with taste. A word of caution though - given its attractive pricing, it is popular with youths, so be prepared for long queues at outlets which are located at favourite haunts of teenagers, like Bugis, especially during weekends. You likely might have to put up with incessant loud chatter as well

We were looking for a restaurant on Sentosa island to have our dinner but well known locations like Hard Rock Cafe are quite expansive thus we did not hope for good meal and reasonable cost together however our accidental visit to Astons ended with positive results. First of all, we were surprised to see in a restaurant that we had to order and pay before we were seated. We ordered and then we were seated Nevertheless we enjoyed spagetti Bolognese which was accompanied with a mushroom soup from the house, sirloin steak and four cans of beers.Compared to other fancy restaurants on the island or anywhere else in Singapore, this has been the best place in terms of benefit and cost comparison in Singapore. .

we ate there after a long day at Universal Studios. The filet was over cooked from their standard of Medium, it looked closer to well done and had the texture of a slightly damp piece of cardboard. My onion rings were stone cold and limp. We asked for plain spaghetti, with no sauce. It took me 5 minutes to get the waitress to understand this then i watched her explain it to 3 cooks who seemed even more baffled as how to make plain spaghetti. After the food was delivered not a waiter in site the rest of the meal. I had to ask the cashier to help with additional order. Better to eat at the Mcdonalds, probably the same beef anyways

On last Monday I have to wait my connection flight for 6 hours at Terminal 1 Changi Airport.While too short to see Singapore city centre, I decided to spend and exploring Terminal One restaurants. On Level 3 of T1 I saw Astons Specialties Steak restaurant, and it looks OK for me to try.My chicken fillet steak is OK and served with a huge portion of Garden Salad, and my friend Fish Fillet steak served with Corn Cob and soup looks yummy also. Well, It is a kind yummy food for very affordable prices. Totally spent less than $23 for 2 people is a good choice while waiting at Changi Terminal One, Singapore.Moreover, the restaurant location at level 3 is adjacent to the T1 Viewing Platform to see the airport area outside, while eating we can see a lot of planes moving outside of the windows
