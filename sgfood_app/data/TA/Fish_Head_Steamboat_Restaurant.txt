It was a great restaurant close to hotel.
Reasonable Prices and service.
Always busy so food is good.

One of the best in years, and I have 46 years of seeking out the same whenever I come to Singapore, and once being a resident! Don't dress up for this one! And chat with the locals!

The ambiance is sort of fast food local style and the dish after which the restaurant gets its name was a really spicy treat. If you are in Singapore it is worth a visit as you visit the various ethnic districts of the city

Great for rainy, coolish evening in Singapore.Very popular and quick service. No brainer - just order the fish, the size and voila you have a great steamboat

Great local food must try the steamboat
We had red goroupa steamboat, sambal clamp, chicken wing and brocoli scallops
Excellent food but the place not to comfortable *usually place with great food doesn't have comfortable seating in asia

Our hotel was across the street and the cab driver mentioned that this restaurant was always crowded. Decided to give it a try on a Tuesday evening. Ordered the fish head steamboat for 2, which came in good serving size. They refilled the soup once for us. My favourite is the soup from the steamboat, which has left me with such a vivid memory that i will definitely be back here when am in Singapore again

We met for dinner here during one of my many stopovers. As we had 5 people , the service staff suggested we take the set menu. We added additional dishes like Malay fried noodles with seafood. We changed the choice of fish from regular to white pomfret and top up a small charge. One dish that stood out in particular must be the tofu with salted egg and the combined flavor was outstanding. The fish steamboat broth was excellent and hearty to the last bowl I would suggested another repeat visit soon

My friend and I arrived in Singapore jet-lagged, suffering from the humidity but most importantly of all, hungry. We noticed this place due to it's unusual name, but weren't hugely impressed with the decor.However, we decided to give it a try and what a decision that turned out to be. From a 3 week trip in Southeast Asia this restaurant gave me one of my most memorable meals. The establishment serves a variety of Chinese dishes, mostly cooked in the Fujian style (lots of crispy meats, slightly sweeter sauces, copious rice) in none-too-small portions. Service is impeccably fast.The only criticism I would have beyond the decor is that the place does look rather shabby towards the back which made me question the hygiene standards. Although I suffered no ill effects from my engorged meal, I would recommend some tidying up towards the kitchen and back door area, if for no other purpose than to reassure future customers. However despite this, I would certainly recommend you give this memorable (in more than ways than one) place a go

We are staying at the Days Hotel in Novena and we found a restaurant near the hotel. The restaurant was packed with local people. The staff was helpful and informative. We decided on the steamboat which is a white vegetable soup with whatever protein you want in it. We had a white boneless fish. The dish is presented in a donut shaped metal bowl with a chimney in the center. They put hot coals in the center which keeps the soup bubbling hot. Rice is served on the side and you ladle out the portion you want. Two people eat for @ 30S. They have these bowls for up to 8 people. What a great meal! If you would like traditional Asian food in smaller portions they have that also
