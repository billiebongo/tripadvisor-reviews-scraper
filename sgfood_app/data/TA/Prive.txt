Very nice environment, good atmosphere, good food, price reasonable and staffs are friendly, all my friends like this place very much, will be back again.
5
Ambiance was great as usual, with delectable food options. Staff are friendly and helpful. Loving the fairy-lights decoration.
4
Food for the Valentine's day dinner set is good. Pricewise is worth it for the experience & atmosphere.
5
It was a awesome experience! Was so overwhelmed by their birthday surprise of balloon, card & cake w/ sparkles. Thank you Privé team 😘
4
Enjoyed the view . Good to sit outdoor on windy days. Good quality is average. Cakes are nice. Recommend for friends catch up with kids.
5
Requested a table that was quiet and had a nice view (as it was my girlfriend's birthday) and they obliged. They even provided a birthday card and a balloon. We liked the food too. Overall good experience.
4
A great place to chill with a view especially when you are sitting outdoors. There is also a mini playground for kids to play.
5
Outdoor seating is definitely better! Just a little noisy because of the mini play area for kids next to our table. Other than that everything was great :)

I visited this restaurant on Valentines Day. I’ve always wanted to come here since it had a nice view. I was really looking forward to it.When we arrived it was not crowded, perhaps because it was during weekday afternoon.Upon reaching, the door hostess offered us 2 options- Bayswater restaurant or the cafe area. While me and my significant other were looking through the menu to decide, she went ahead to bring the person queuing behind us to his/her table. And she never came back....My Boyfriend and I were standing there waiting for her to come back. We stood there for a while. Understandably the Waiters and Waitresses may have different set of duties, but they simply walked past without attending to us or alerting anyone to do so. We had to walk in to approach a staff to bring us to our seats. Even if the door hostess (aka vanishing staff) was preoccupied, she should have excused herself or delegate another staff to attend to the waiting customers. After all, first impression matters.As for the food, the fish and chips was fresh and crispy, portion was also generous. The wagyu beef burger was delicious, the bun was really good...Though they forgot to add cheddar to my burger. All that aside, the waitress who served us was cheerful and friendly, that deserved a commendation. They offered me an option of sparkling, still or tap water. I ordered still, they gave me warm water. So if you’d like iced water perhaps you’ll have to specify clearly. My iced lemon tea was too sour. No sugar syrup offered, so you might want to steer away from ordering it.Overall, I enjoyed the the company of my Boyfriend, the view and the food
3
The keppel bay branch is just by the waterfront, so it’s pretty nice to have your meals there if you are planning to go with your partner. Food was okay only. We ordered the chilli crab pasta but the crab was either very overcooked or not fresh. So food experience wise, not too impressive for us
4
The atmosphere was good, great place to chill out with friends. The good was good, service could be better:)
4
Nice place to hang out for water front dining. Food is nice and prices reasonable. Service is prompt.
5
Celebrated my wife’s birthday along with 2 young kids. Great value from the food and a complimentary slice of cake was served that cake along with a card from prive. Great gesture!

Their main assets - location, music and the kids' small playground cannot compensate for the slow service and very inconsistent food quality and presentation - the main reason you are there, Prive?We go there with friends from time to time and the food and service is increasingly disappointing. Dear management - you could really work on it as not much more effort is required to improve on what you should do best. Prive - it is such an aspiring poshy name but you do not deliver. Maybe some of you could go undercover to check this out few times. If you are lucky you will get beautiful chips and if not - they will be soggy, salty and tired looking as if they were collected from other plates. The same goes for other dishes, taste and how your plates are decorated. One day the plate is beautifully arranged and one day - just random and untidy. One day they taste ok, one they - as if a random person prepared it. I tried to grab somebody's attention for 15 minutes to pay the bill - hello - it is Sunday evening - of course it will be busy so why are you understuffed? should you not be prepared for it and have someone on stand by? the staff is nice, but they are inefficient. so little is required to improve this place and with your name, location, aspirations you should excel as you take money for it. I am just frustrated that I did not ask for money back. Apologies to other reviewers - maybe my expectations are too high
4
If you are walking around Bukit Chermin or Keppel Bay this is a nice place to have a drink or brunch.It faces the marina and Reflections and the Caribbean.I was there on a breezy morning and it was a nice relaxing breakfast.Food and service were good but not much to write about
4
Always love coming to this restaurant - usually after a nice afternoon walk from Labrador MRT nature walk (passing through the mangrove boardwalk, bukit chermin boardwalk, Reflections at Keppel Bay condo, the row of boats) then turn right via the long bridge to Marina at Keppel BayNice ambience, lovely view, soothing jazzy music, good service & overall nice food/drink options. Some food could be better :) Price is quite reasonable The nutella milkshake ... mmmhh is Yummy ! Slrrpp
5
As a frequent patron of Privé, I have nothing but good words for them.They have a very good variety to choose from and their food never fails to amaze! The staff always has a smile on and their service and attentiveness is a huge welcome. The Keppel Bay location speaks for itself with its relaxing and peaceful ambience.This is definitely my favourite Privé outlet of them all
5
I’ve dined here on more than 3 occasions, the food selection is good, the food is served pretty quickly, of Cos, it was delicious and the service is impeccable. Brought my brother and family to have his actual bday celebration at Prive yesterday. He was really pleased... thank you
5
I was here on a drizzling weekday but everything is as smooth as a sunny day. From walking from parking lot to the restaurant to ordering food n payment. I strongly recommend avocado toast and mushroom soup. The toast comes w salad n chips. It is a very quiet afternoon w a awesome yacht view.
5
Brought some friends there for a casual dinner and to some of them, this is their first visit and they love it. Love the ambience and food was good too. We also celebrated one of the friend's birthday there and when they heard about it, they presented her with a card and balloon which I thought was a nice touch.
4
Surrounded by the sea and yatch - the perfect place for a leisurely meal. Mini playground for the kids.
3
Good ambience
Food is average
Deep fried chicken can taste out of fridge
Attentive waiter/waitresss
Prompt services
5
Food was quite nice, and price was really reasonable! Breakfast set contains so many things that couldn’t really finish for 2 person! Service staff was really enthusiastic so 5 stars for that
5
One of my favourite restaurants
Cons limited indoor seating and menu
Pros out of city feel and good service
5
Food was absolutely excellent. Spread of choices covering continental, some ME and Asian makes this place a one-stop satisfyer for all fuss-pots!
Go try it out - it’s good value too!
4
I love the ambience of the area. It was beautiful and dreamy. It would be nicer if there is more choice for the food. Most of the good has bacon/ham, especially for the pasta
5
Thank you for putting my name on the reserved table, made my guest feel special. Nice ambience outdoors, though it might be messy if it rains. Grateful also for holding my reservation though I was late.
5
Their deserts are great! Mediterranean salad is worth trying. Great lunch place to have a short getaway from the office.
2
was a frequent guest for prive keppel bay, i have invited a guest for a dinner but some reason all the dishes served are below standards. we ordered no buns burger made of beef patty and deep fried chicken as a bun. the chicken is unedible, it is so dry and seems that was in the freezer for too long same with the beef patty. the vanilla milk shake is not a shake but rather a juice. the only thing we ate that we like is the wedges
5
Reserved about 1 week in advanced. Upon arrival, was promptly shown to a cosy table outdoors underneath shelter (as indicated in reservation request). Food was good but not too value for money as the portion is not very large. Service staff was polite and very helpful. Great ambience, good place to chill out.
5
The food was great, the peice was ok, the place and the view was amazing, but most of all, the staff were very accomodating and friendly- very attentive and mindful of their customers. Will definately come back.
5
We went there for a birthday celebration away from the city to find great food and time. This place served us both
5
the service is perfect and the environment was nice and is a good place to take photo. the food is delicious
5
Relaxing to have your meals while watching yacht. Food-wise rather decent. Just beverage service kinda slow.
4
Overall was good. Transportation conviniency is another consideration. Happy with that dinner. Will consider another round of visit.
4
Tasty lunch and drinks place. In midst of Keppel Marina.
Had nice Eggs Benedict as late breakfast / brunch. Recommendable.
5
The staff were very polite and helpful. We did not know about the complimentary red velvet cake for birthdays, and when we mentioned that we were here to celebrate a friends birthday, they informed us and did the necessary preparations very impressively. service was great and we had a great time.
5
I was looking for a nice place to have brunch after a staycation. I came here once before and have been eager to bring my boyfriend after he enjoyed the desserts at Prive at Asian Civilisations Museum. I had the wholemeal club wrap. It was filling and delicious
4
Prive is located in an ‘island’ separated from our busy working city. Just like a scene in movie… yachts docked at the bay, serene surroundings with fresh sea breeze. We booked a table for dinner, and they made our reservation so personalized!The staff are friendly and attentive. Food is marvelous. I love the Sticky Date Pudding. Pizza is good
3
Upon arrival at the restaurant, was greeted by the manager and after verifying the reservation details was usher to a table outdoor. The view was amazing. Upon seated, the manager asked for preference of sparking water or ice water. I order ice water and the manager went off. After deciding what to order, i try to get attention of the waiter but all seen to be rather busy.Waited several minutes and finally an Indian waiter notice us waving and was given a 'wait' hand sign as he was settling the bill for another table. Few minutes had passed and the another table had left however no one approach us to take our order and looking over i saw the indian waiter was tickling another korean waitress playing around instead of attending to us. Did i mentioned ice water was not even serve to us. after another few rounds of waving then the indian send a korean waitress to serve us.the food was amazing when it arrived. we enjoy the food and everything was great. after our meal, the Indian waiter came over and ask permission to clear the plates and was given. left over our coffee that we haven't finish.moment later after I finish my coffee but my wife have not, the indian waiter just came over to remove our cups without asking permission. My wife wish to eat the biscuit given but was taken away by the waiter and did not even ask.Much later when i ask for the bill, the indian waiter came up with the bill. after payment was done, the indian waiter just return my card while flirting with another waitress. A thanks you or wat so ever was not even greeted and walk away. Probably the Indian waiter look down on us and the service given by him was not welcoming not much communication. with him around the cafe will tarnish the reputation overall, the food and view is amazing will return again and hope that the service standard could be better. We are paying customer and we deserve to treat like one as we pay for 10% service charge!
5
Lovely place, good service and kid-friendly! Food was great and of substantial portion (at least for me).
5
Overlooking the marina, great food and atmosphere. Ideal location for adults and kids alike. Deserts are fantastic.
5
Had dinner at Prive Keppel Bay with le wife, great ambience at casual mood.. food was above average at affordable prices, drinks were good esp during happy hours
4
good food, great service and awesome atmosphere! perfect for dates. absolutely love it. always threr for brunuch and tea.
4
Went to Prive for lunch and had the tofu sandwich. Definitely came to me as a surprise because the tofu came as fried chips but the menu didnt say so. Veggie patty was a lil too moist and soft. Boyfriend had the steak and frites, which was so-so. But the oreo mudpie was good!Ambience was nice too, and service pretty good.
5
My friends from Manila were in town last week and their perception of Singapore is just work and shopping. Prive gave them a view of how Singapore can also be a place where we can just chill. Thanks for the awesome food and service! Kudos to Rey who was most accommodating and friendly!
4
Good food n ambience but service can improve. We were there for breakfast amd reserved for table of 5. Restaurant in that hour is not crowded at all, and we were shown to a reserved table that is 2 x small square tables tuck at a corner. Granted there was a nice small name tag bearing my name that was custom made, but frankly it turned me off, how could whoever in charge of doing reservations not be sensitised. In the F&B industry, being able to delight customers is key.In the end we requested for a bigger longer bench table and was grante
5
I visit here often for brunch with my family and friends. They have a nice selection including a huge platter if you just can't pick one thing. There is a nice kiddies play area to keep the little ones occupied too.Prices are reasonable and the view over the harbour is great
4
The restaurant is located by the Keppel bay with views of the Harbour. You get a nice breeze to cool you down. We tried chili crab pasta, fish and chips, salads, steak and burgers. The food came very fast. They have a playground for the kids in the middle of the restaurant
4
I visited this place together with my date on a Saturday night for dinner. The restaurant was busy when we arrived at around 8.45pm.Make sure you make a reservation on chope beforehand if you intend to visit. The service staff promptly show us to our table upon confirming the reservation. Both of us had the Pan-Roasted Chilli & Lime Salmon, and a cup of coffee each. The dish tasted good and the waiting time was surprisingly short. Dining outside in the alfresco also makes for a pleasant experience with the dimmed lightings, and you get to marvel at the architecture and private yachts around you. I would recommend this location for a meal if you have not visited the Marina at Keppel Bay area before
4
Nice place. Food is ok. A little hard to get the waitress. Overall ambiance is very good. Quiet at night and nice for a chit chat.
4
Ambience was relaxing and romantic. Had a great dinner with my friends. There is a satisfactory range of the choices of meals. Definitely going back again!
5
Like my title suggests, it’s:
Super family friendly
Good selection of food
Excellent service
Beautiful location
5
Good service from the waitress there! Special details was added into the dining experience! My date love the arrangement from the team very much!
3
food served were not hot. taste wise was just normal, nothing fantastic. the crab cooked in chilly crab spaggetti was not fresh. thus, over priced for the food!
5
Good food (with wide selection of breakfast, brunch and..dessert!!) good service and good ambience, super family friendly. A good place to start your weekend. Will definitely visit again.
5
I am a frequent diner at Privé cafe (Keppel island outlet being my favourite!) as I really love their Eggs Benedict. It is my usual order all the time! Coupled with the pretty views of Keppel, this is truly the place for brunch. :)
4
Their breakfast choices are nice, especially the french toast and pancakes. However, the price is slightly steep. Will not consider coming back unless I don't have a choice.
5
Mostly western food. We had wagyu burger, aglio olio with crispy pork n a steak. All are good. Nice ambience
5
Thanks to each and every of the staff in Prive Keppel Bay for the arrangement of the surprise cake which I requested and also the super surprise card from them with all their well wishes to my husband, he was really happy and shock. Thanks once again. :
4
Good place for gathering over brunch!
Very thoughtful of the staff to provide complimentary cakes and cards with staff signature for our birthday celebration there! thumbs up!
4
Pros: Food was served promptly. Beautiful ambience.
Cons: Ran out of certain items such as fries. Cookies used in the desert was too hard. Feedback was given but manager did not address it at all.
5
The service was great. The ones who served us was friendly and welcoming. Food was not bad, but the atmosphere really made the whole experience amazing.
5
Love all the Prive outlets especially the Keppel outlet. Great view. Great range of cakes and desserts. Food portion is big. Service is excellent.
4
I ordered Fish & Chips, the portion of the fish is 30% smaller compared to my previous visit few months ago. Overall food still good. Reservation is highly recommended especially during weekend.
4
We went here to celebrate my birthday, the atmosphere was superb and the service! They gave me a free birthday cake with lil fireworks lol! Overall food was average but big servings! Service was awesome!
5
Requested for a surprise cake for my Boyfriend's birthday and the staff serve it with balloons, cards and sparkles from them. We are really pleased with their service and personal touch for us. Thank you!
4
It was nice but service can be abit more attentive . Keep waving and waving and maybe it was so dark that they couldn't see me.
4
Staff were friendly and food were good! Ordered clam chowder, linguine with crispy pork belly and roasted half chicken.
4
We love this place. Once you enter, you feel like you're on holiday with a nice view on all the yachts there. The people are friendly, the food fine (not fine-dining, but decent food) and as said, the setting great. They have a small playground for kids and they can also stretch their legs on they quay, where there is a fence. Great place
5
Had lunch there to celebrate my bestie' s birthday. As always, the quality of food and service was excellent. They even presented my friend with a huge greeting card signed by the staff there. Sweet!
1
I ordered pork knuckle. It was cold, tough and tasteless. I politely made this known to staff who refused to do anything whatsoever. I was more upset about the attitude of the staff than the meal.
5
We did enjoy the foods, cakes and the place.
Excellent services.
We did appreciate the birthday cake arrangement too.
4
Came here for the desserts before and came back to try the brunch and it was not disappointing all. Good food with good ambience. Everything was perfecttttt👍🏻
5
Generally nice setting and good food. Burgers are juicy. Try the outlets at the ACM and Keppel Bay which are very different in atmosphere.
3
We had a hens party here but the food is really expensive. 3 pieces of chicken wings for $12. You have to drive in order to reach this place, not able to get there via public transport.
3
The view and ambience are excellent, the service is alright and the food is overrated, not bad but it's average
4
I liked this little bistro with its lovely decor and delicious food. You could be forgiven thinking you were in Nice or Cannes as you dine on delicious fresh salads with a cheeky glass of red. Food is very fresh and varied and the staff are exceptionally nice, The only down side as with many places in Singapore that are so tasty is timing your visit so you get a table
3
Delightful view of the marina and very nice to enjoy.Food is so so - rather bland and not special at all. Served incredibly quickly - so quickly that our starter and main arrived together in about 5 minutes. The place was packed with a mixed crowd and buzzing.
5
I had also completely forgotten about this place if not for a friend's suggestion to lunch here .Couldn't be a better choice , especially on a weekday when the crowd was thin . Such a pretty sight with all the boats in the marina around us . A nice change from the hustle n bustle of the city . The food was good too - a miss of local and Western favourites . I had the quinoa Salad and my friends had chicken rice , Nasi goreng .we'll be back !
4
We came back to Prive at the Keppel Bay after a few years & the quality of the breakfast is still as good as before!
5
Wonderful view & chocolate milkshake, atmosphere is perfect for a lazy Sunday chill out.
The staff here are extremely attentive too. Kudos!
4
Area has good ambience be it indoors or outdoor, great venue for catch-ups/dates! Wide variety of food and desserts too.
4
The atmosphere was good. We had a nice evening. We were a little let down by the portions though. The staff were polite.
4
Service Good, food good with excellent view too! Recommended. Would love to try other dishes and during night time for different view.
4
Attentive staff. Decent food. Nice ambience. There were some vegetarian options. Enjoyed the evening.
5
awesome view and ambience at this outlet. their brunch is highly recommended! definitely have to try their egg benedict, one of the best i've tried so far!
4
Been there for couples times, the portion is quite large. May need to share with friends but with really good and tasty brunches.
3
It was my second time dining at Prive Cafe, however this time round the services provided was rather poor. Perhaps, it was due to one private event held and it seems to be short of manpower.Thus, the waiting time to be served for seating, taking order and payment were longer and slower than normal
2
The restaurant was under renovation and we were seated in the next door kids cafe area watching children running around and Cartoon network. It was supposed to be a special dinner experience but ended up feeling like eating at a nursery school canteen. The food was sent late after a few reminders to the waiters. The restaurant should inform the customers they won't get the nice sea views but instead be watching cartoons on the TV screen. We paid for the special dining atmosphere and felt short changed.
5
the food was good. served quite fast and still piping hot.
service was good too. waitress was friendly.
4
We come here for brunch time to time and our favourite is pancakes. We always enjoy the food and the lovely view from the restaurant.
5
My friends and I weren't expecting birthday balloons and card from Prive Cafe Changi. The extra mile effort the team did, had make the celebration unforgettable. Really appreciated.
4
I enjoyed the brunch with friends at this Privé Cafe. This was my second visit, will be back again soon. :)
4
Prive did it again by giving great birthday surprises. However, my previous experience is much better than this time round. Perhaps, the mornings are better than evenings.
3
Good atmosphere and good food. However even when I email them in advance to serve the cake once we are seated, I've to remind them multiple times until the sky had already turn dark resulting in a not very satisfying photo taken.
4
A good place to escape from the usual bustling city, slow down the footsteps, and take time to enjoy the breeze and scenery.
4
We had fun n good food here, and my kid enjoyed it most. With an indoor play area n sheltered playground, it's the place to go and have kids entertained while adults can enjoy a good chat and good food.
5
Booked Prive Cafe for our BFF birthday celebration and we were very pleased with the nice ambience and great service! The service people were all very friendly and kind, all wearing a smile on their face. They also gladly helped us take photos. Food was fine as well, although it was rather pricey. We were also very happy with the complimentary slice of birthday cake for our friend. It was definitely a nice gesture! Surely will reco friends to go there
5
The food the service and the smiles on the servers face just made my morning breakfast experience perfect. The server's bright smile and warm greetings was great. Singapore being Singapore, yes I was sweating throughout and the 2 huge fan in front of me didn't quite help. I am in a tropical country and chose an outdoor seating. I should suck it up. Lol!
5
I like the eggplant sandwich w chips as well as the moscato. It is a very nice place to chill out even though it is raining. A perfect place to dine w yacht view. Very close to Harbour Front.
4
Love the sinful Gula Melaka smoothie and the local delights. Had Chicken Rice, pasta and pizza. Good thing there's fan, not humid to dine outdoor with view of the yatches and Carribean.
4
Very welcoming, reservation was personalised with my name on the table. Ambience is still as nice, however standard of food seems to have dropped and price on the high side.
4
Prive @ Keppel is idyllic with good view of the docked boats while having a meal and/or a drink. Or a dessert while watching the boats.
5
i've been back a couple of times and i always have a good time. This time round it was for a birthday. There were sparklers, cake and card. My colleagues are a believer of Prive Cafe now. The cool weather, jazzy music and beautiful view were perfect. Thank you, Prive, for valuing your supporters and making our visits great experiences
4
This place is an extension of the Asian Civilization Museum and right by the Singapore river. It is ideally located. The food is good, the price reasonable, and the scenery beautiful. If you take a friend or visitor to the Merlion Park and need to find a good place for a meal, this is a good choice. Just a few minutes walk from the Merlion Park
4
Visited Prive Cafe at Keppel Bay as heard of good reviews on the view. However, the service really needs improvement, we have to keep asking for the same thing over many times but it was not given to us (ie menus, children cutleries). Have to also wave real hard to catch the attention of the service staff. When pre-arranged with the restaurant on the birthday cake, the person-in-charge assured that it will be arranged accordingly after our meal & table will be cleared. However, the table was not cleared with dirty plates when the cake was brought over. And I have to remind the staff a few times that the cake can be served.Is really a nice place but lack of good service
3
Table reserved was wet and the children activities were not given to all. Some kids were given so many balloons but some none at all. Could pay more attention to the kids since it's a kids friendly restaurant. We had to ask for kids' utensils and high chair.
4
This is in a lovely location with good service. It's not fine dining, but what is there is of good quality and fulfilling. Had lunch there and enjoyed the wagu burger and then pizza for dinner. The portion of chips will do two people! Reasonable price as well
4
Had just finished dinner and came here for a rest to whilst away the time. We took the seat out in the outdoor. Luckily, it was not too hot and you can oversee the marina area. The place is relaxing with music playing though the noise level can be a bit high. Good to just chill here and talk the night away till 12am. We got latte and tea since we could not eat anymore. Latte was so-so. The servers however were quite enthusiastic and friendly. Will be back to chill and try their other foo
5
Had a relaxing lunch at Prive! Though it was a hot afternoon, I didn't feel the heat at all, with the big fans blowing. Had the mac and cheese and carrot cake. Food was ok, service was great.
5
The food was good, the staff were so friendly and helpful. I celebrated a birthday there and they were so generous with the celebration! Good atmosphere and amazing service! would go back there again and again!
4
Their location is very nice at outside terrace.
The food is nice and service is also good.
The point is the restaurant is too busy on weekend,
so the service is a bit slow.
But recommended.
4
Food is great, price is reasonable, portion is large. Please make reservation before you go, else you will expect a long queue.
4
Simple breakfast in the morning. Staff is acxommodating and food came fast. Abit disappointed w ultimate breakfast. Eggs Benedict was nice n filling. Nice ambiance
5
Easily accessible by Uber. 10/10 experience if not for the intense heat at 12 in the afternoon. The food was great and the service excellent. We went for a nice walk around the area beautiful!
4
The service was excellent. Servers are polite. The food serving is generous and the ambience is cosy.
4
Seamless dining experience from start until end, the food were generous in portions and the staff were remarkably efficient despite the crowded weekend crowd. Making a booking for a table is certainly advisable, or you might just be left waiting. Take a stroll around the area after your meal, it is quite a pretty sight
3
My advice is to go only if you are going to travel by car/taxi. The location is good because of the ambience and view but it is not accessible at all. So what happened was, my boyfriend went there by public transport and we had to walk for about 10 minutes from the bus stop. By the time we reached Prive Cafe, we were sweating and although we wanted to dine outdoor because of the view, we had to sit indoor for the air conditioning. Thankfully we still were able to see the view from our table. My boyfriend ordered the Ultimate Signature Breakfast whereas I ordered the Margherita Pizza (because I'm a vegetarian). Sad to say, we both felt that the food was just average... maybe we ordered the wrong food
4
My kid wanted to eat out on her birthday at a place that faces the sea and we thought this place would do just as well cos if you sit outside the restaurant, you will have a view of the sea with the boats berthed there too. We didn't tell the restaurant exactly that were celebrating our daughter's birthday but I am rather impressed that they picked up the unintentional clue that I left on my reservation note and that was that the birthday girl is coming in on a wheelchair and needs somewhere convenient. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised when they called up to enquire whether I would like to order a slice of cake for her with complimentary wordings on the cake and sparklers. It was really a nice gesture in their partWe ordered the Pan Roasted Chilli & Lime Salmon, Boston Clam Chowder and Margherita Pizza and they were yummy although the Spicy Spaghetti Arrabiata with Seafood was not great. Perhaps because I have been spoilt by my helper at home who can cook this dish very tastefully The Choc & Salted Caramel Cake is not great either. Tasted better ones elsewhere. But the service here is rather prompt and I am happy with this. Oh yes! I love their Sunset Sangria and as it's happy hour (daily 5-8pm), we were supposed to get either one for one or one at half price. I would definitely come back again especially during their happy hours for the drinks and to try other food.
5
The best place to bring your true love. Great food. Even greater is the ambiance and view. Service is beyond words. Mt favourite place to recharge and refresh.
4
The environment was fantastic, great view, nice ambience. However food wise was just satisfactory. However the dessert was great, great presentation too.
4
Love the ambience at night. Furthermore the staff was really friendly. Seafood was really fresh as well. Would definitely go back there again
4
We had a great time with the food and view. The birthday gal was very happy with the place. Most of them were there for the very first time and we talked about how we should come back again. Love the mushroom soup and pasta!
4
Nice ambient and service, but food is average, especially the steak menu.. over cook despite requested for 50% done.
5
Went there for brunch with families. Kids love the place much. Food is definitely no complain and price is reasonable.
5
My second visit there and I had bunless burger. As the name suggest, there was no bun in this burger. It was beef patty between fried chicken! A must-try for meat lover like me!
5
it was my sister birthday so we bought cake from the display. The staff gave her birthday card and design the plate with words but cake taste normal.Carbonara tastes so goodPork belly too crispy and too 'well done', difficult to cutScallop in the pork belly set are too saltySpring chicken taste norma
5
We got here on a rainy day. However, our experience was still very nice. The service was great. And the food was a little bit pricey, but very satisfying. I had a Wagyu burger, clam chowder, and Mac and cheese with my wife. They had interesting ice coffee too, where are the coffee was the frozen into espresso cubes and you pour the milk into it to make a drink.Their systems are very efficient, with automated reservations, and even using iPods to take your order. They had nice outdoor and indoor seating and the rain made sitting outdoors very soothing and calming. This place is also very kid friendly with lots of colouring and activities and a children's play area for the whole family as well. I would definitely recommend this place and come back again.
5
Booked a table last night to celebrate wifey's birthday. Not my 1st time there but 1st time with family, they love the bay view ambience. Though it was not windy but fans were provided to give us that sea breeze feel, the restaurant is really thoughtful.Food were above average and portions were just right. Service staffs were cheerful and attentive. My daughter have bought a cake for my wife's birthday and dater our meals the service staff cleanse the table and bring out new set of plate and fork, they also light up sparkle and candle before we sing the birthday song....Kudos to the service staffs for their excellent...we will come again because of your wonderful deed and service

Staffs and food is always excellent. always a great place to chill on weekend or after a hectic day of work.
4
Great food, great harbour view! It's an old favorite where my family has came back time and time again. The burgers are our favorite.
4
Always enjoying the view and the atmosphere. Good service and friendly staff. One of our favourite restaurants in Singapore.
4
its always nice coming back to this cafe. even though its at a prime location, service here remains heart-warming. food is good as well.
4
Nice place for brunch with view of Keppel bay. Food pretty average but cakes were above average. Good place to bring kids as they have kids play area.
4
great venue for friends for TGIF. you can have food at privé cafe and then drinks after at the bar outdoors.
5
The food was good with decent portion. Two thumbs up to the service crews whom are attentive and very prompt upon request for items.

I'm a regular at Prive but this is my first time at Prive for dinner. Their brunch and lunch offerings are extensive compared to dinner but just as tasty. I had the salmon with couscous and my husband had the roasted whole chicken with roasted potatoes + veges topped with port wine sauce. The creamy dill sauce brought together the favlours of couscous and the fish. Extremely delicious! If you are having desserts, don't miss out on their sticky date pudding! And the truffle fries with garlic mayo for starters

We arrived into Singapore for a 5 night stay with our son and his wife living at the nearby Caribbean complex on Keppel Bay. Arrived late so straight to this cafe overlooking the harbour on Keppel Island with the collection of luxurious boats and yachts. A beautiful spot but have to say the food was a big disappointment. I wasn't hungry so ordered Parmesan chicken wings which were bland to say the least (certainly couldn't taste the Parmesan at all). whilst my wife had the "Mediterranean Mezze Medley". She let me try it and I have never experienced a dressing so tart that puckered your lips and constricted your throat! No way did the chef taste it before sending out - it was just drenched in this off putting dressing to the point it was almost inedible though my wife did her best to eat it given she was hungry.Their wines by the glass were good especially the Pinotage ($15).Thus overall, it was disappointing given the potential of the place and the chef can do a lot better, if in fact he cares about the food he serves. If he doesn't then time to change him out
4
It was peak period when we called to make reservation (was actually trying our luck), but the service staff was friendly but suggested to us to do a walk in. And we thought since its quite close to vivo, if its too crowded then we do a detour. Turn out they had a table for two (smoking area). The ambiance is wonderful, the weather was fantastic and the service is great. They will check if you want your food to be served in any particular order. We had pork belly, mushroom soup and pasta. The food was served quite fast. I really liked the place
5
I ordered steak and it was nicely done as per requested ( medium rare) and all our food were served fast. We do not need to wait long to have our lunch. Waiters were prompt in their response. Service was good.
4
A repeat visit... This time for brunch instead of dinner. Staff were attentive and friendly. Main courses served promptly. However the desserts took a while. The ice cream for my kid never came, despite it being part of the kids set meals.
5
Definitely good food with great service. Love the view and ambient as well. We ordered the egg benedicts and big breakfast and it was good.
4
An awesome venue. Despite the Valentine's Day crowd, the staffs were all happy and cheery. Couldn't have asked for more.
5
The food portions were just nice for us. Definitely not on the cheap side but I am definitely paying for the view regardless if its day or night. The service crew were all very well mannered and cheerful! Great job!
5
It's a good ambient and place for couples to relax and enjoy. Windy sea breeze makes the environment more comfortable to sit.
4
Generic menu which is adequate and a pretty okay kids menu, the little kids play area outside and a kids corner inside keeps 1-7 year olds entertained either side of eating time. Nice setting, good staff - it's an easy choice when looking for a bite to eat with the kids in tow.
4
Café plus....adjoins the wonderful museum of Asian Civilisations where (free for Chinese New Year period) a most enjoyable couple of hours were spent. Outside tables didn't appeal as rain was looming indeed a mad scramble to transfer gear and people indoors ensued. In Malaysia and Singapore coffee houses are everywhere but the coffee itself highly variable...chains offer Starbuck style dishwater in various forms...here the coffee smelt good but still seemed under-par...ok we are spoilt in Auckland and Wellington. A peanut butter and cream cheese pie was an enticing Americano concept but disappointingly dry. Croissant perfectly respectable, and a (house creation?) mango chia seed pudding superb...that's the one to go for and about half the price of the Euro stuff. Lovely setting by the river and well worth a visit. SIngapore staff come in two varieties a bit like HK..those who pretend they cannot understand, and gabble back so as not to be understood or be put in any sort of unwanted helpful position, or those who behave as if they love you and their work and are attentive, helpful and considerate. The latter here
5
Me and my boyfriend celebrated our advanced Valentines Day at Prive Café. Despite the location not as conveniently accessible (however you can easily grab a taxi), the ambience was out of my expectation! The vibe is good and the weather complimented our whole experience. It was a wise choice to opt for outdoor seating! Overall would highly recommend this cafe for great brunc
5
Perfect Eggs Benedict and the Perfect Cheese Omelette!! Even the side order of bacon was Perfect with the right crisp! All in all a Perfect breakfast that's why we can forgive the fact that our flat whites arrived after three reminders and after we were almost finished with the food. We empathised because on the morning in question, their order/cashiering system had gone kaput so the staff were hard pressed to get orders out in good time. The food arrived pretty fast and as we looked around, all diners looked satisfied so it was only the drinks station that was facing issues. We asked for a table inside because with the Singapore weather, you never know but no complaints. It was a lovely sunny day with a nice breeze but we were happy in our air-con cocoon where it was quiet (i.e. no kids running around!). With the convivial environment, lovely pathways to stroll before and after a meal, the excellent service staff and great food, we will definitely be back for more
3
The food was great. Atmosphere amazing but service sucks. If you don't drive good luck trying to get to this place.
3
The ambience was good. However, the food & coffee was a disappintment. There is still room for improvements.
On the other hand, it is advisable for the staffs to check "how's the food" at appropriate timing and once will do.
4
The service was great and the waiter even ask us how was the food. The atmosphere was the best of course but it was a little dark
3
The food is very average and not value for money. The playground there is not well maintained as well.
4
Good ambience and excellent service. The food wasn't excellent (we ordered the pork bellow, clam chowder and mac & cheese), but they're okay. Take the outdoor seat, it has a much better view than the inside if you can stand the heat!
5
Perfect date to bring your girlfriend/ boyfriend to Prive Cafe which is located at Keppel Bay! Great food comes along with great atmosphere!:) you can catch a sunset after it ^^ Which is very beautiful!
3
Celebrated my bestfriend birthday over here and no doubts the ambience was good. The songs played, the view, and our seat is just right. A lil disappointed with the food though cause I felt like it could have been better. Ordered the burger and the rib sandwich and it just average. Didnt even take a photo cause it doesnt really look nicely presentable or even insta worthy. Nevertheless im impressed with the wide range of cake that I can choose from to surprise my bestfriend. And im surprise they even present it with a firework. That was good! All in all, my bestfriend still enjoyed her birthday dinner despite the average food. So im still quite thankful. Thanks to the lady who lighted the firewrk and took picture of us!

It was supposed to be our wedding anniversary celebrate therefore i have made table reservation early at 12.30pm for my family of 5Knowing that come late will affect the cafe business, so i plan to go earlier before the timing. Prior to this there was a reminder call from the cafe a day eariler and i did inform them that i will be coming eariler at about 12pm.Unfortunately my table was not ready when i reach at about 12pm, so i was sitted at the outside area while waiting for my table. 12.30pm my table is still not ready. I have to ask them about my table at 12.31pm. To my surprise, previous guest had left but the table was not setup. We were only sitted at 12.33-34pm. I was quite disappointed because i notice walk in customer tends to get table faster than reservation. So what was the point of reservation? I also do understand the cafe limited eating time of 1.5hr therefore i plan to go early and not overrun the timing given.Luckily the only thing that save the day was the prompt service and food.

It was our first time we tried prive in keppel bay and we usually go to chjimes. Ambiance is good and relaxing but too crowded on weekends. Yes we just tried it yesterday sunday at 12 noon.the smooties are good however the quiche of the day that was served to us wasn't fresh and we didn't complain (our mistake as we don't want to ruin our sunday) we thought they used some different kind of mushroom and cheese when we got home we had a food poison and terrible diarrhea. We knew it's from our Quiche. Second check your bills as they charged us 16 dollars for mango and watermelon which we didn't order at all. We knew it when we checked our bill in the car. Our mistake we didnt check at all when paying. We had to go back and of course ensure they waived off the 16 dollars which they did. Just be careful and check your bills as prive keppel bay is too crowded on sunday and they might charge you unneccesary orders. The salad was not fresh either and the restaurant can't handle on busy periods. The lady on the counter can't speak english and we had to wait for the supervisor to handle our take away dessert. Overall, we're not coming back the food was not fresh and we had a diarrhea. We still kept our receipt and if we still have diarrhea we will complain and see our doctor. Not a good start for having brunch in keppel bay. Disappointed. The price that we paid for is not worth it. We might as well go to Wild honey or Bakers and cook for brunch same price but we are more satisfied with the food. Price here is a ripped off
4
We just fall in love with their Aglio Aglio. It is one of the best that we have eaten and it is a must to order if we dine there. Service is great despite at time the staff is super busy during peak period. Nice ambience to relax and chill. It is also a good place to bring the kids there as they have an indoor kid corner and also an outdoor playing area
5
Perfect ambience, great food. Servers were friendly and the place has an absolutely remarkable view. The staff even called me a day before to understand my needs for my booking the next day and helped arranged it as requested.
4
I went there with my parents on New Year's Day. Overall food is good but not superb. Red velvet cake & coffee was rather good. Outdoors ambience is nice but if rainy or too hot it's an issue.
4
A cafe with very chill vibes, that serves up an interesting and varied menu. Tried the beef sliders and they were really yummy. I was particularly impressed with the selection of milkshakes. Besides, the atmosphere is casual and relaxing, perfect for a weekend brunch.
4
The service of the staff there were great! The view was good, even though we are sitting outdoor but there were sufficient fans around.
4
The waitress is very patience with customers when we cant decide on the main course we want. She will explain to us on the different kind of cooking as well.
2
Wife chose to come here for birthday lunch but ultimately a big disappointment. The so called bacon in my breakfast and the carbonara turned out to be fatty gammon... my wife's burger had to be returned twice for undercooking. Cancelled order. Great location and away from crowds. At least my coffee and my son's chicken rice were okay.
3
The tables were small, cluttered with utensils and plates, water jugs and pepper/salt mills...so left with little space for serving our dishes. Dining was inconvenienced by the space constraints on the table top. Food wasn't exceptionally nice, so felt overpriced. We celebrated a birthday and it went well because the staff were attentive and helpful.
3
This is our 2nd visit and we kind of like this place as it is away from the crowds. Food is average but i think it's fair for the price. Service was kind of slow though, you could be standing at the entrance and none of the staff bothered to attend to you.
2
Came for breakfast (dinner service is usually ok). Waited nearly 10 minutes for menus and rather longer to order. Staff had no idea what they were doing. They seemed to be playing with their phones half the time. Wrong orders brought twice. They did not know what was on their menu. No issues with the food when it finally came
4
Booked a table for 2 for business discussion. The cafÃ© was pretty quiet for that evening. We managed to find a section where there are hardly any other customers that evening. In many ways, the idea was good but it was let down by the fact, the staff rarely appeared and we had to look for them a couple of times.The wine ordered by my associate was good (Australian sharaz which is very popular these days) and we both ordered 3 course dinner where main course was the steak. The Australian grass fed steak was good as it was really medium rare that night. Alas, the staff forgot about our dessert but they was fast to remedy and even offered us the buffet spread of dessert above what we ordered. The setting was pleasant with a bit of breeze coming in but it was too pitch dark to enjoy the marina and the waters. As we left, I saw that most of the customers they had that night were there for drinks instead of dinner
5
Loved the food anx the unique shakes. Even on a sunny morning it was cool and refreshing to sit out. Great way to spend some quality time with close friends and family. Enjoy a lazy brunch.
5
The view and food was great.Service staff did an excellent job especially Ms Wani. It was a memorable birthday celebration for my wife..Thks
5
Enjoyed a BEAutiful eggs Benedict.... my first time here and really really look forward to coming again sometime. Three thumbs up.
4
Strongly recommended for casual dining in alfresco setting. Very relax ambience with lots of greenery. Food wise affordable with great service. Could be better if oyster happy hour offer can extend to Prive Cafe dining.
4
Service was very good and we were greeted with a very welcoming smile and greetings. Overall was satisfied with the food and service.
P.s. The food was very nice and worth the price
3
The big let down was the presentation of my wife's birthday cake despite I paid for the cake.nevertheless it's not bout the money. Really wished the presentation of the cake was pleasant.
4
This is my 2nd visit to Prive Cafe. I was there with my wife, 3 year old daughter and my siblings. Just like my first visit, the food was really good though it comes at a premium. The view was lovely and they have a few big standing fans stationed at various parts of the outdoor seating to ensure it wasn't too warm. Food was served relatively fast after ordering so the food arrived still warm/hot. The servers tried their best but I think they were overwhelmed as it was a Saturday evening and the place was crowded. I also wished they could install a few bug zappers around the outdoor seating because when the sun went down you will notice some small flying insects which can be irritating when you are trying to enjoy your meal. Also take note that you need to drive, take a cab or use UBER or Grab to get this place as you have to walk quite a distance in from the main road
5
Visited the Prive cafe first time . My friend suggested me about this place . Wonderful view of river/bay . The food was great . Especially the service was excellent by (Sikh guy) always smiling on the face and very polite and friendly . Nice place for Food 
4
Came by here for brunch and was very satisfied with the food and service. I thought th prices were very reasonable and the portions were large enough to fill you up but not bloat you.Service was excellent from the moment we walked in. The wait staff was friendly and always attentive.I would like to highlight that if you intend to sit outside to enjoy the view, your table options are very limited. The establishment needs to install more umbrellas to offer shade from the sun and potential rain. I thought that would have been a given in a climate like Singapore and was a bit surprised it was not
4
We took the whole family - 6 kids - ages 3 to 15 to this Cafe on our first night in Singapore (we were tired) and it was great. The food and drink service were very fast and the food was enjoyed by all ages - different and interesting kids menu (not the standard chicken nuggets) and the range of food for the adults was excellent. Would definitely go again.
5
Love the vibe here! Service is very good too. The waiter promptly asked us to move indoor when the weather changes. We were saved from being drenched by the heavy downpour which came a few minutes after we shifted to our table!
4
We had lunch today and had a great table overlooking the harbour. Very attentive staff and nice vibe. Nice small play area for kids. Foods and drinks very truly value for money.
4
Just at the harbour of Keppel bay. Really nice location. Service was just okey but food really good. They have everything al from good breakfast to lunch to dinner. Strong recommendation if you are in the area.
5
This is one of the best cafe to bring kids along. Kids enjoy playing at their small play area. Great ambiance to just sit and have a drink.
5
The food was good and served quickly. The servers were friendly.
We enjoyed the atmosphere and food.
2
Since I life in the neighbourhood I am a regular customer of the Prive Cafe. Unfortunately, I experienced over the last couple of month that the food as well as the service is getting worse with every visit. It doesn't matter what you eat, the burger or eggs benedigt etc. The food doesn't look appealing and the taste is below acceptable quality. I wish we could enjoy the prive as it was a year ago. Nice food, perfect service and beautiful ambience
5
Food portions were appropriate and price reasonable.the gula melaka dessert was delicious.Ambience for breakfast with the morning breeze and boats sitting lazily there is soothing.Great place for dining too as the setting sun puts the mode for relaxing.A bit too hot to sit outdoors for lunch
5
Visited the cafe for the first time to celebrate a friend's birthday. Made reservations over the phone and the lady was nice and helpful. I told her I was celebrating a birthday and she suggested for us to order a dessert then so that they could prepare it in advance, with a message written in chocolate on the plate; a lovely thought that I agreed to. When we arrived, a lady received us with a smile and let us choose a preferred table, as the cafe was fairly quiet on a weekday afternoon. We ordered the ultimate breakfast and straight cut fries. The food was excellent. Prices are affordable and portions and presentation are good (we spied the other tables for their food and it looked great!) I'll definitely be back for the food. We were stuffed! When it was time for the special dessert time, we were blown away by the service. Our birthday girl was served the lovely dessert with balloons (!) by the staff singing a birthday song, in Korean! A big shout out to all the staff for warm memorable service, especially to Joe who sang us the song in Korean. It just turned out nicely that the birthday girl loves Korea and their lovely culture! I will be back for the service. The only negative feedback I have would be with the desserts. They look gorgeous and the cheesecake was great but some cakes like the raspberry cupcake were misses because they were dry. But this minor point can't take away the great experience I had today. Thank you Prive! You have exceeded my expectations
4
Dinner with The Ultimate Fish & Chips that is normal and Braised Duck Leg Pie which is a bit salty. Atmosphere is solid sitting outdoor for couples if the weather is fanastic during night time. The service by the waiter/waitress is good recommending and explaining the types of food/drink/desset that they offered. I would recommend the outdoor tables during evening times for this restaurant to couples who are celebrating their birthdays, anniversary, proposing etc. The evening atmosphere looking at the sea and yatch are sort of cool and romantic
3
We had the indoor seating but felt that the aircon wasn't strong enough probably cos we were sitting near the glass and therefore nearer to the heat.We were asked if we want still or sparkling water, but weren't informed that there was a charge to this. Only realised it when we asked for the bill. So do take note of this. There's FOC water at the water station though.I ordered Prive Ultimate Brekkie. It was quite delicious. But the potato rosti wasn't what I expected. It was more like a hash brown. But overall it was good.My hubby had the pull pork burger. The bread was grilled a tad hard and need some jaw exercise on it. Other than the pulled pork, there was also this red cabbage which is together with the pork as filling. We find that the cabbage somehow stolen the taste of the pull pork as it tasted a little sour, I think its pickled or something due to the sour note.Service was good in general
4
Service stafg was kind enough to suggest if we wish to share a pot of tea instead of us hving to order a pot each which we may not finish.
4
The restaurant was very child friendly, with a tv area for kids indoors and an outdoor playground area. A good place for parents to chill on a weekend while their kids busy themselves with activities.
5
Love the vibes of the cafe. Ordered the ultimate brekkie, pancakes and straight cut fries (with truffle oil). Food was decent. Will be back again because we simply love the atmosphere and the tranquility of the place!
5
Nice place for food and drink!
Alfresco area and friendly staffs.
They serve nice food and wide range of innovative beverages
3
They have staffs but mostly looks like v new.. not much experience.. ordered coffee n waited for more then 10mins for it to arrive. Food was average.. price kinda steep.. view magnificent..
3
Chance upon this place while taking a walk from VIVO city. It has a pretty relax and casual ambience facing rows for luxury yachts. Had a beer and some snacks which is overall decent enough for me to come back. Will try their lunch or dinner someday. Sort of place where you can be alone or with a friend. Enjoy the breeze
4
Love the ambience. Enjoy the Breeze from sea. View of the marina and luxury yachts.Foods are ok, but a bit pricey though. But you pay for the ambience.I was told that the weekends brunch was very popular with the expats staying at the condos around the Marina Club.Will come back again for the ambience
5
Its a lovely place to chill with friends with really affordable prices. It has become one of my regular chill out places !! Their deserts are yummy especially their passion fruit meringue chiffon and their red velvet. Their bread are yummy too !! Service is prompt and staffs are friendly. Highly recommended !
5
Great central location at the banks of the river; Wonderful view over the city / river / little green park.We went there several times to relax and recover after strolling through the crowded city center. We truly enjoyed sitting in lounge chairs shaded by large trees.Food is delicious, too: Fresh and modern small dishes like salads, quiche, sandwiches, and pastries.We would definitely go there again
3
Headed over to Prive Cafe on a Sunday early afternoon for brunch, with high expectations of the food and ambience. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a host, who was not very friendly. We made a reservation for indoor seats. The indoor area was cramp and was no where near cosy. We waited for the table behind us to leave before we took the empty chair to put my bag, in order to have more legroom to dine in comfort. Food: We ordered the Prive ultimate brekkie with scramble eggs and Ultimate Fish & Chips. Food was served promptly, but cold. Scramble egg had too much of the milk taste. Fish & Chips were cold as well, too much flour coating for the battered fish. Won't revisit again..expected a more spacious and cosy seating with better views.
4
Was given outdoor seats although I've requested for indoor seats. Staff was kind to explain that it was due to faulty air-conditioning & it'll be better to be outdoor. Food was nicely presented and yummy too. Service staff were attentive and quick to response.
4
The outdoor setting was lovely. Service staff were attentive and food was great:) good for family outings
4
Good food, good service and nice and informal. Look out over the marina so you feel you are out of the city. Very relaxed. Loyalty card if you are a resident in Singapore.
4
Fantastic ambience and lovely wait-staff. The main courses were filling and satisfying. Enjoyed the drinks too
5
Service staff was good and polite. Only gripe is kid's meal portion downsized by a lot. But overall, the service was very good.
4
Nice view with good food, is a good place for family and friend gathering and for couple who want a romantic dinner.
4
Love their fries with truffles oil and the wings.
Atmosphere is good for gathering with friends.....
3
I've been coming to Prive and bringing people to Prive for at least 8 years only due to its million dollar location and views. Whilst service and food have improved over the years (it used to be disgraceful) it's still not great. I waited exactly one hour today before I was asked if I would like another coffee. Whilst they have upgraded their seating the restaurant next door drags it down with a random display of fans, furniture etc outside looking like someone forgot to clean up.  The venue could be one of the best locations for al fresco dining in Singapore but sadly they've missed the mark
3
Stopped for a quick drink and decided to try the much promoted 'Perfect Mojito'. Not sure what we were served but it was definitely no Mojito. It's a drink often made incorrectly but when an establishment promotes such as the highlight you expect it to have the correct base ingredients. We tasted, paid and left leaving the drinks behind without any query being raised by the staff. Normally when a customer does this it is an indication that something is not quite right - that is the moment in which to ask
3
We were attended by Kiran, and he made our lunch a real pleasure. The service was excellent. Food was okay, the view was beautiful. Though it was too hot outside. It is a great place for kids as they have a little play area for them too
4
Finger foods are good, but main course so so...
Compensated by hardworking staff and nice environment.
5
Always loved the place and ambience little on expensive side but secluded place away from city life can really have peaceful time
5
I was just thinking the kids would love to see the yachts right outside the cafe. But I had a pleasant surprise when I saw the playground at the cafe itself. They really enjoyed themselves before and after their meal, which they enjoyed too.
5
Good location and beautiful ambience! Love their attentive service and will definitely come back again.
5
You must try the Pork Belly here, simply the best pork belly I have ever tasted in my life. Without comparison.
4
With family of 3 pax and total damage is abt S$80. The view is nice and service crews are friendly, just a bit hot if site outdoor aft 930am....

A restaurant situated right by a boat dock, what kind of atmosphere would you expect? This restaurant has friendly servers who had a cheerful disposition. We came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning, and ordered the below:- Ultimate Breakfast - $20.00- Hazelnut Pancakes - $12.00- Mocha - $7.00- Long Black - $4.50- Babyccino - $3.00The ultimate breakfast came with scrambled eggs (choice of scrambled, sunny side up, or poached). The eggs were too buttery alas. The rosti tasted like it was leftovers from last night as it was rock hard at the bottom like it was re-heated on a grill.The sausage was decent enough with soft meat but the skin was a tad too tough to chew through.The hazelnut pancakes came with Nutella spread (which was nice!), but the pancakes itself seemed also to be leftovers that were reheated haphazardly - there was no taste of freshly-made pancakes. The piece of honeycomb on the side was a REALLY nice touch which I liked very much.The mocha was so-so, and the long black was too sour/acidic.All in all, the dining atmosphere was great; although the quality of the food could use some improvement. Adding together a 10% service charge and 7% GST, the total bill came to $54.70.I will return to this cafe, but only because it's probably the only cafe by the marina
3
Its a beautiful place surrounded by blue sea and yacht. The downside is its too crowded for comfort. Food was pretty much average, nothing wow. Service was good with attentive staff who actually take initiative to offer kids bowl set for my toddler. Its has a mini silde outside but it was placed under the hot sun, so didnt let my toddler went to play. I notice its not very well maintained either. After reading so many positive review on prive, I would say its pretty overrated, there is still room for improvement.
3
We have been to this cafe on many occasions and I must say they have better and worst days.1. Service - poor, very slow but friendly. Unfortunatelly every time we went there they mixed up our orders. An example: I have ordered eggs benedict with salmon - they forgot about salmon and the eggs came out cold2. Recently their food became worst. Perhaps they have changed their chef.3. What saves them is the location and the decor. Very relaxing atmosphere if you are not in a rush, beautiful view of the Marine Kepppel Yacht4. They are child friendly - have mini playground, colouring books, child menu etc.5. They serve freshly squeezed juices, coffee with soya milk but no gluten free options on the menu6. Price o
4
This restaurant has a nice view of the Marine Keppel Yacht when you have your dining outdoors. It is outdoors but sheltered so even on a wet weather day you can still be seated on outdoors to enjoy your food or drinks. Indoor dining is great too and with a children's corner within proximity grown ups can enjoy their meal and at the same time keep watch over children. There is a small play area for children at the outdoors too. The service crews there give their best to provide good service and are very alert so you don't have to raise your hand for too long before you get their attention. Food is great for both kids meal and from the main menu. Excellent place for a weekend meal.
5
Nice place to entertain visitors in a pleasant casual setting, sitting al fresco overlooking the marina at Keppel Bay. Service has improved out of sight since we last visited several months ago. Food was prompt, good value & tasty.
4
Lovely place to sit outside by the marina and watch the world go past while you enjoy a good food and a relaxed atmosphere.
4
Lovely breakfast would not hesitate to return. Not only was the food good but the price was reasonable as well. Great place to go even with kids as the can play on the glass while the adults finish up.
5
Good food and very cosy ambient. We love the casual dining and excellent service. The food was served fast and delicious dessert to end the meal.
4
Hi we were group of 6 Adults and 5 children, a great place with natural light and an excellent view of the Yachts of various Shapes and Sizes.
4
Nice view from the restaurant, the foods are nice and service is good. The restaurant has very nice decorations too.
5
It was a lovely brunch time which we had at Prive Cafe. We enjoyed the relaxing ambience, good food quality and friendly staff. Thanks!
4
Enjoyed the leisure afternoon at the cafe. Though a bit noisy due to a large group dining at the cafe with children, overall experience was good. Staff was attentive and this helps to keep our cool. Pleasantly surprised also to see the cafe offering 50% of cakes after 3pm. Will sure visit the cafe again.
3
Definitely not my first visit which was why I suggested for my friends to dine at the place. It's usually ok but on that particular Sunday afternoon, the servers seemed to be in a foul mood and it shows on their faces and body language. When the food was served, one even slammed the plate onto the table without apologizing. One didn't even know they serve Sangria on their menu. The minute steak panini was way off standards. My partner gave up eating halfway and was reluctant to feedback because the entire cafe seemed to be in a foul mood. This incident was one-off and I know this is definitely not the Prive I know. I will still return, however, based on my previous experiences with them.

Been to here quite a few times n yet to write a review. Standard of service is there each time i was there. In fact i think the standard has improved even more from the last time I've been there. Keep up the good work! Very kuds friendly and there's even anice cosy kids corner with storybooks!! What's more to ask for... great food, wonderful service n not too pricey! :)

It's not the first time I am here but my first time taking the outdoor seat. Nice & romantic sitting outside just a little warm.
5
Great selection of food, staffs were very attentive to our needs. Love the atmosphere. Thanks for making it a pleasant.
4
Was at the Prive Cafe recently to celebrate my son's birthday. The food was great value for money but some food is pretty rich e.g the Pull Pork Knuckle Panini. Portion is generous but there was too much butter and pork fat in the sandwich!
4
Food was tasty and portion size was decent...the environment is casual and there is variety to choose from...it helps that there is a view to enjoy the meal with...
4
The outdoor seating provide great view of the yatches, the sea and sky. Coupled with comfort food, make my brunch gathering with friends a very enjoyable one.
4
Easily accessible by walking. Duck leg salad was nice. However, the service could be better. We had to raise our hands a couple of times to get the servers attention when it wasn't crowded.
4
Came here with a group of friends on a Staurday morning. Got a seat indoors. Great service. Good food. It will always be my first pick to have eggs Benedict. Generous servings as well.
4
Privé is a favourite of ours living so close by. The food is always amazing, this mornings choice was the Omelette.I think though the best thing about Privé is the attentive service you get especially when visiting with a 3 month old.Unfortunately this time there was no shaded seating outside so we choose to sit inside, which is nice however nicer outside. The restaurant may want to consider giant umbrellas for the tables as a suggestion
3
Went by for a late lunch with my mom on a quiet Monday. Service was slack but nothing to complain about. Food was unimpressive, overrated and frankly, not worth the price in our opinion. Our mains came out 15 minutes apart, which I didn't understand since it wasn't busy. The view was beautiful though
3
The best thing about this place is the setting and atmosphere. The outdoor seating overlooking the Marina is lovely. There is a nice buzz and it's very relaxing. The menu is quite extensive with plenty of options, though not many if you don't eat meat or fish. The service is very lack lustre, and during a previous visit the service was downright stroppy for no reason. The mains were just ok, nothing to rave about. And they came at different times, some along with the starters! Why?? The desserts were good however. This is a passable place. It has so much more potential
4
Gathered with friends in the evening and enjoyed pretty much good food with friendly service. Except insect biting..
5
Great staff, great food, great ambiance. Excellent! Will certainly go back again soon! I would recommend it to my friends too.
4
Beautiful way to spend a Sunday lunch on the water, sitting outside at Prive. Food was above average with huge portions and service was friendly and attentive. Would recommend
5
Always a pleasure to spend an evening at Prive. Great food, Great Ambience, Great Service. Keep it up guys!
4
This place is nice for a sunday afternoon. Food is ok. Staff helpful and the view on the Harbour with,sometimes, impressive ships is great!
They could improve on their interior though.
Worth a visit. Ps also for lunch!
4
Great service, staff were attentive and the ambience is excellent for children.
Will recommend for family.
3
Food value for money. Great ambience. Unique latte served. Some of the cakes are quite nice..a different experience between day and night
4
We really enjoyed our dinner. The service was very good and the atmosphere excellent.
We would definitely go back.
4
I must say, the sticky date pudding is to die for! We didn't enjoy the mains as much as the desserts. The variety of cakes available is plenty. Kids menu is available too. Staff are very friendly and accomodating! Reservation is recommended especially on weekends.
5
Been going here for many years, I usually take a stroll over mid morning to get the pancakes, alongside a fresh juice. The staff are always helpful, and its relaxing especially through the week.Would definitely recommend if you want a nice brunch breakfast looking out over Keppel Marina!
4
The pancakes were v good and the staff made an effort to ask if everything was ok and if we needed any other condiments. Generally the cafe is crowded during weekends but the vibes are still gd.
3
Will give higher rating if their staff can be more attentive? I had to yield at them to get their attention when come to ordering food.
3
The fan was blowing directly at me. Other than that, everything was fine. The outdoor tables have smoking trays for us.
5
The ambience and service were fantastic. The pork belly was superb and the pizza with artichoke had a nice thin crust
5
Prive used to be and is still me & mr hubby's dating place. We loved the food, service and atmosphere. We agreed to re-visit the next time with our princess.
5
Food is generally good. There's not much sea salt taste to the sea salt and caramel cake. Ambience is good.
5
Good for an alfresco dining experience, if weather permits. Food of decent portions, above average in taste with a slightly higher price tag for the ambience.
5
Was here last Friday 15 April 2016 to celebrate my wife's birthday. Ambience was wonderful. Opt for outdoor seating. Though Singapore is going through a heat spell but there were ample standing fans outside to make it bearable. Love the view of the yachts berthed at the marina. Food was definitely not cheap but above average and yes you can tell them to remove things you don't want in your meal. I felt the kids' meal was worth the price. We ordered a cheeseburger for my 3 year old daughter and it came with a side order of fries and a cup of cranberry juice. It also came with dessert which was 2 cups of vanilla ice-cream with 2 small brownies, a chopped up strawberry and lychee topped with mango puree. My little one loved it! Service staff were attentive and I didn't have to wait long to get their attention. You can pre-order a cake from them by calling up their customer service but you have to do it 3 days in advance. All in all a wonderful dinner and will definitely return
5
I was really satisfied with my visit at Prive Cafe. The ambiance was perfect for any couples out there who plans on having a nice dinner date. Apart from that, the service and food there was great as well. Although the food took some time to arrive, but well, it was worth the wait. Definitely a place I would recommend people to come. Thank you for the great service, food and place:
3
Definitely easiest to get to Prive by car, table reservations highly recommended especially during weekends. This is the ideal place to chill and have a long brunch session with friends and family, or even as a couple, topped with great view and outdoor seating available. The food is generally of average quality, though they have some pretty interesting items on the menu. We spent about $25 per person on average. Service can be rather slow due to the full house situation. Overall, nice hang out place for a relaxing afternoon
4
great breakfast with a view. service staff are friendly. The ony thing that disappoint is the menu is limited before 1130am.
3
The food is good, quality and quantity matches the price. Of course, need not to mention, the view was excellent.
5
A visit here is always worth while..as awesome as always... Great for family dining and wIth friends.. Will return again..
4
Great ambience and good range of food and desserts to choose from. Sit outside to get a view overlooking the yachts n water.
5
My daughter absolutely LOVES Prive! She had so much fun on the toy car, the playground, the colouring and the cartoons. Food was reasonably good.
2
My wife and myself went for dinner on Friday 11th March. We ordered a bottle of wine , a salad , pasta carbonara and fish Mediterranean style. Within 5 minutes even before we got the wine the salad arrived it was fresh and no issues. However before we could even eat half the salad the main dishes arrived and then the bottle of wine. The fish dishes must have been from a cancelled order as the tomato puree actually had dried up on the plate and the fish was very dry. The pasta was cooked fresh but it was more cream than pasta. Since we were really very hungry we ate it and then decided to order a banana strudel with ice-cream what we got was a warmed up muffin !!!!!! However this time we called the staff and we were told that it was a new chef and he was confused!!!!!. Overall not impressive and later we both had to take medication as we had stomach upsets and my wife had vomiting as well. Last time we go there
5
It is most unusual to find such a lovely eatery by the water in Singapore. We loved the whole ambience of Prive Café. There was a beautiful breeze blowing whilst we had our lunch outdoors. The ingredients for the dishes we ordered were very fresh and well prepared and the portions generous. The staff was not only courteous but also friendly. Definitely a place to return, bring and recommend to friends.
1
Our family of 4 went there last Subday for brunch. The restaurant was busy and there were many screaming and crying kids. As we had made reservations, we were led to our table without delay. That was the only good thing. 1) the table was dirty with food stains. My shirt was stained after I leaned forward while seated because I did not realise that there were food scraps at the edge of the table.2) the drinks coaster where our glasses of water were put on also had leftover food scraps. It looked like a piece of banana or egg yolk. When I pointed this to the waiter quietly, he simply removed the coaster without an apology.3) we wanted some ketchup during our meal but could not see any staff around. While trying to be understanding that they are busy, my husband walked to the cutlery station to help himself. As he was there, two waiting staff walked past him without even a pause to ask if they can help!4) the wagyu beef burger looked and tasted like it came out of the microwave. Not even a hint of char on the patty. The patty wasn't pure beef patty but instead uses onion as a filler. Totally disappointed. Will not go back again.
4
We changed our reservation from a birthday dinner to lunch due to unforeseen circumstances. We managed to get an outdoor table. Good service by the servers, the cafe was quite pack. The pasta wasn't good - undercook and abit bland on the sauce. DIY hot chocolate is an interesting concept, I like. Birthday cake was a good one - with firework! Thanks
5
Really enjoyed our time in Privé Café. So breezy and such a lovely view of the marina. The food was a good complement to the ambience. The duck confit salad was one of a kind. I also enjoyed the aglio olio! Divine :)My friends didnt quite like the Fish & Chips tho.
4
The service staff is attentive. The food is nice but fish and chip can be better, the fish is alittle to dry to my liking.
4
Breakfast was good and good kids meal set with drinks and deserts. TV indoor with CN to entertain the kids and also colouring activites were available. Outdoor playground is great too!
4
Really beautiful place but don't expect too much from the food. Decent but not exactly amazing. Would definitely bring my partner for subsequent date definitely.
4
Wanted to come here for a long time but never got around to doing it. Glad to have come here - the portions are generous and taste great! Hope to come around again to enjoy the child-friendly facilities.
4
Staff were very responsive with good service and dining atmosphere was excellent. Food was not as spectacular.
2
Good for bringing girlfriend for the scenery, but definitely not for the food, one of the worst egg benedict I had eaten.
1
Ladies night promotion is not applicable for CafÃ©. Only available at the bar which is only a few steps from our table. Alfresco seatings was in a mess. Cushions were not prepared and tables are not set. Not given a desirable table but we are not allowed to choose
5
This place is good for a chill out, gathering with old friends or even family. Service is great, the manager Bernardo goes out of his way to make everyone comfortable and accommodates requests as best as he can ! Will definitely be back to this plac
3
Had lunch here. It has good views, overlooking the marina. The menu is lovely, good choice of food. Healthy choices as well, unless you want to indulge in a thick creamy milkshake . Quite good for families. Personally, it was a bit too crowded with children. The service was average. Not very personable. Took them forever to get our coffee to our table
2
We live at Telok Blangah and decided to take my parents here for dinner after a walk along the pier/harbour.Maybe I booked incorrectly on the website but we arrived assuming we'd eat at the restaurant upstairs, to be told it was closed. It wasn't closed. There were people in the restaurant.We were seated in the cafe downstairs - right next to a climbing gym and garden spotlights shining right in your eyes. We decided to make the most of it, which was difficult given the screaming, uncontrollable children next to us.We ordered our meals. A pizza came first. 10 minutes later - 2 of the other mains. I was brought my chicken 20 minutes later.Seriously though - why sit us near a climbing gym
4
Location is good alongside the Keppel Marina's waterfront.
We've just sit outside, alfresco is better than air conditioned.
We've order Vegetarian pizzas.. Wow! it was very nice. Service staff are all friendly.
Definitely I will come back for their another pizza!
4
The service was prompt and courteous, and you need a reservation as the indoor seating are limited.
Mostly western dishes a la carte order and wine list has a ggod range.
Prices are slightly higher
5
Food was good especially the cake.
They even made a surprise to my boyfriend with the happy birthday cake and sparkler!
A pity it was raining heavily and could not see the sunset. However, there were many stars at night.
5
The atmosphere and service is of commendable standard. Great place for chilling. Will definitely visit again!
4
Visited on a quiet Monday evening with 2 friends to celebrate a birthday. We were greeted by friendly staff and they managed to help us out with the cake. All in all a good experience, would come again!
3
Having heard wild raves about Prive over the years, I thought it would be a perfect place for a birthday brunch. However, as I was there on a Saturday afternoon, (and being really unlucky) the cafe was filled with huge groups of diners. I made a booking for indoor seating, so you can imagine the amount of commotion going on in there. It was also difficult to get hold of the service staff. Oddly, the staff behind the counters will watch as you flail your arms trying to get the attention of their colleagues (who were not too far away from them) and do nothing else. Anyhow, once you get hold of the service staff, they are really nice people. The breakfast set was edible. The sticky date pudding was soggy. I don't know if anyone likes soggy sticky date pudding but I didn't like it. Overall, the place's pretty average
4
We visited this restaurant twice one with the large family group and one time just the 3 of us. Both times our experience was great. They were able to accommodate different choices not mentioned in the menu. Service was fast and good and view is breathtaking
4
I always enjoy going to Prive Cafe for dinner because I like the atmostphere there. Went there over the weekend to celebrate my husband's birthday with some friends from Sweden. Service there was good, as usual. But the food I had selected was quite a disappointment - at least to me. I think they may have revised their menu because, and if I remember correctly, they used to have my favourite grilled salmon but it was not on the menu anymore. Instead they had fish & chips and the Mediterranean baked snapper, which was what I had selected because I prefer seafood to meat. Whilst the fish was quite tasty, I can't say much about the accompanied sides, as I am not a fan of cous cous nor olives :) I hope they can bring back the grilled salmon item. If not for this dish that I've chosen, I would have given it a 4-star rating at least for the food.
5
Second visit and still loving the Keppel atmosphere, and dining experience. Spicy arribiata with slipper lobster, squid ink rice and sticky date pudding was still my favourite! Staffs are all very young and friendly. Noticed this particular waitstaff Angie who was always attending to our requests, I must say she's always on the move and giving prompt and attentive service. We need more of such service around. Everything went well, would visit again
3
It wasn't a pleasant experience as the water glass broke suddenly and scared the kids. Limited manpower and took us about 30 min to order. Good portion is big but croissant wasn't good as the dough in it wasn't fully cooked and we asked for replacement 3 times. Kids friendly with all the toys being helpful
4
- at the Keppel Island marina, past the signature Prive Grill and the Bar
- lovely view nearby
- has a small children's play area outside
- plenty of alfresco seating
- young, friendly staff
- food tends to be a bit too oily.
5
We were late for our appointment, but the restaurant called and reserve the table for us! Amazing food yoo!
5
Nice place to eat... Will go back again. Although limited area at outdoor not much spaces... Food is good and service was not bad
5
Very smooth and wonderful brunch. Staff were accommodating and fast to respond. Everything went very welll!
4
A great hangout place with friends & family! Great ambience good food! Will definitely visit cafe again!
3
We had a light dinner here. Party of five. Meals are mid range European/American style cuisine. All tasty enough, but not particularly remarkable.
A great location with a nice viewpoint and a busy vibe, but I wouldn't be rushing back here.
1
While I have no issues with kid-friendly restaurants, this one takes it up a notch by providing young children with toy cars they can ride around in. The problem lies with the restaurant allowing the children to ride anywhere and everywhere in the restaurant - between aisles and tables etc. The kids kept bumping into our seats and the wheels of the cars made a loud, annoying noise that prevented a quiet conversation. So, this place is perfect for families who need entertainment for children but a nightmare for everyone else who is looking for a relaxing brunch venue.
2
The Initial waitor couldn't speak English fluently so we couldn't really tell her about the doneness of the burger.We couldn't switch seats despite the fact that we made a prior reservation.The chili tasted alot like ketchup.The soup was full flavoured but the truffle oil wasn't fragrant enough.The pulled pork burger was also full flavoured with a slightly tough texture and had a fairly awful presentation with veg spilling out.The aglio olio pasta was nicely El dente. Slightly salty though. The Burger nicely done with crispy fries and a decent salad.Both drinks were niceThe Triple chocolate was sweet and rich but not too sweet due to the presence of dark chocolate. The Smoc was attractive and interesting visually.After our meal was done for a good few mins, the staff appeared more interested in staring at their phones than helping to clear the plates. Water wasn't refilled either.Decent food with a few hiccups, at this price a slightly better standard will be ideal. 3/
5
Highly recommended for those looking for a nice casual dining venue for a lazy weekend.Food here is great! Beef done in the right doneness, fresh fish dishes (I would recommended the beer battered fish n chips or pan roasted seabass for fish lovers), portion is not small. They even have a decent kid's meal for the fussy little ones.Leave some space for desserts, worth trying their red velvet.Diners get a good waterfront view and if you're lucky, a nice breeze on a windy day. Just need to be a little careful of the poor toilet trained birds if you're going for their outdoor seats
3
One of our close friends had invited us for lunch here...a group of 15-20 people. This is a good place to unwind on a weekend afternoon. The menu is built around fish n chips, burgers, pizza, pasta and wines-n-beer. Average price per main course serving is about S$25 and drinks are about 9 bucks for a pint and 15 for a full bottle. This place is very similar to Sentosa Cove in its feel but smaller. Food is decent (again, many more eateries at the Cove). However service is average. Our party was marred by a heavy downpour and the staff was all at sea while making alternative arrangements even though the place wasn't that packed. Could even hear lot of cutlery and crockery being broken. All in all a 6 on 10 experience. Sentosa Cove is pretty much in the same price range, has more options to offer and is more buzzing. Guess this place is more for the nearby residents. A beautiful place though with lovely yachts and sailboats to ogle at while having a lazy brunch by the sea
4
Food @ Prive are delicious. Our family had a great lunch there.
Portion of the food served is generous. Value for money!!
5
Amazing waterfront view with refreshing breeze, paired with lovely food and top notch service. Special thanks to one of their staff, Angie, for constantly looking out for us and taking care of our needs. A place that's recommended for all 👍🏼
4
Mains, all day breakfast and desserts were very good. Nice coffee too. But certain cakes were not as good as they look. Nice environment overlooking the marina and yachts.
3
food was normal. Cakes were quite good. Staff service can be better. Took quite a long while to get their attention while asking for bill. Restaurant was not busy at the time. They were always head downs. so had quite a hard time to get their attentio
4
The place is awesomely romantic... I was there with my wife. Eating your dinner right at the bay with yachts all around you actually gives you an Australian feeling. They have (re)created the ambiance perfectly.Food actually could have been better. 1. We ordered a Salmon dish which was good but not GREAT. I was told that it'll be lemony and tangy flavor, but it wasn't exactly like that. 2. The second item -> Grilled Vegetable Sandwich was PATHETIC. I had to return it. It was supposed to have tomatoes, onions, pickled cucumber and a lot of other stuff apart from beetroot. In reality, it had just "Boiled" beetroot in it... bland taste... very bad sandwich. Do not try that.I must mention that on knowing that the sandwich was so bad, the restaurant didn't charge us for the same. The service quality overall was excellent.Overall, as we were in good mood because of the ambiance, so it was a nice evening. But the food was a bit of letdown.Although, I will try this place once more
4
We went there for company Christmas dinner. The location and environment is quite good. We had a toast first by the bay and had dinner with four courses. The duck as main course and the dessert Chocolate pot au crÃ¨me were very nice! The service is good as well. It was a unforgettable experience to have dinner with all my colleagues there
4
We were visiting friends in Singapore and specifically told them we didn't want the over crowded vibe of Orchard Rd. & didn't want to eat at Hawker centers cos we wanted to chit-chat and spend some time catching up on things. They suggested we go to Prive Cafe, and boy did it surprise us! :D There were a lot of people considering the place is not really accessible by public transportation. You have to walk around 10 mins to reach the road that leads to Vivo city. GREAT views of the harbor with yachts all over the place. Very chill & cozy. Perfect if you just want to escape and enjoy some downtime - with friends, or even by yourself.I think the food was good. We tried the Big Breakfast, the Eggs Ben, the pancakes, & some pulled pork sandwich. I would say the food was at par with the other brunch places in SG. But nothing extra-ordinary too
4
They were not able to contact me for my seating preference and took the initiative to reserve an indoor table for me in case of inclkement weather. The rain stopped and when I asked to be moved outside, they managed to set up a table for me without fuss, after checking that my party was okay with a table near the smoking area. Very thoughtful
5
This is my second visit to Prive and this name as we booked early got a seat indoors. We were very happy with the service, the wait staff were friendly and immediately gave us kids dining plates and even some paper and colouring pencils. The food was delicious and great coffee. Overall we had a great time.
4
Lovely ambience.The food was served quite fast, though the quantities of the main course were rather small and you need to order a few starters.It was my daughters birthday and they called earlier to market a slice of cake, thought the 'Happy birthday' lettering on the plate and the sparkler were free of cost.
5
The staffs are extremely helpful and offer me great assistance to make this day successful and great :) will recommend to my friends
5
Everything was perfect plus the superb service of their staff "Angie". Relaxing place and good value for money
5
Went there for my anniversary. Food quality and service was top notch. Outdoor seating was romantic.
5
Perfect place to go with family. Even though the air conditioner was too strong but all the atmospheres and food and services were perfect!
3
I went to Privé restaurant on a friend's birthday. Lunch was good, salads and sandwiches. Nothing outstanding and a bit expensive. The marina view is very nice with a cool breeze (which really helps in Singapore's heat).
5
Privé wrote a personalised happy birthday on the plate without me knowing even though I just ordered the cake itself. They remembered my girlfriend's name because I wrote a special request on Chope when making this reservation. All the staff wished her "Happy Birthday" when we went off. It was an amazing experience.
4
Everything was perfect, the view, the staffs, except for the soup. Soup should be serve first before the main course. Our soup was delivered together with our main course, end up we only manage to drink half of it as it had turned cold while we were having our main course.
4
The beautiful old buildings at the centre of this complex drew us in, and the festive lighting above beautiful gardens – not to mention the buzzing night scene - kept us there.Privé Bar’s outdoor setting and informal seating was the most appealing, among several other similarly groovy eateries. Perhaps it was the Bee Gees soundtrack that also seduced us to stay and eat.The beef pies were perhaps not the best choice in a café that recommends its burgers, but the drinks were well worth staying for. A couple of Mojito and Dirty Sanchez cocktails at a reasonable price were the perfect accompaniment to the nostalgic eighties music and we swayed happily to the romantic memories of Saturday Night Fever.Aah, Singapore. Privé does you proud
2
We arrived for Sunday lunch with 2 kids and 3 adults. Drinks took 15 min to arrive and we had to remind the staff twice. 2 adult meals arrived first, 15 mins later the children's meals arrived and the final meal a full 25 min after. The staff look frazzled and I could hear other customers complaining about the wait times.I asked about the sea food platter which is only available form Friday to Sunday to be told that they were too busy to make it
3
We went to Prive as it was the closest to Keppel Bay, where we were staying.Good location, right on the bay - however, it doesn't have a bay-view like some of the amalfi or Santorini cafes would. The pier is docked with boats and its a small one at that. Still, its a good location.Outstanding service.. Top draw.. Every order met with a courteous smile, all dishes very well explained, small alterations to our orders (we are pure vegetarians), and a really good sendoff.. Totally amazing.We ordered the beetroot salad and spaghetti pasta, both of which were very good. And even though we didn't plan to have desserts, we ordered 2 portions of the banana cake with ice-cream.. It was that good.So a touch expensive, since we paid 94 dollars minus drinks, but it was a good place to dine.Our friends told us to go for dinner as it would be alacarte. That would be for another time
4
It's my 2nd time here and i still find the experience very pleasant. I ordered ultimate brekkie and it was so good. Service was prompt and they do ask for your feedback during meal time.
Definitely coming back again!
4
Great place to hang out with friends and loved ones. Food was average but the ambience makes up for it!
5
Perfect place for a date, the view was amazing, food tasted really good and service was excellent :)
4
yummy breakfast, beautiful settings / views. Staffs are friendly and attentive. The views during its day and night are different.
5
Great service and the food is good! Attentive to my toddler too! The coffee is good too! Thank you! :)
5
The food was great, the staff were friendly and accomodating. Exactly the place i was looking where we can dine and my kids can roam around and play at the same time. There will difinitely be next time
5
Had fish&chips, fishermen catch pizza and the mushroom soup. Awesome food! Moscato primo is good too
2
We were meeting a few friends for Sunday lunch and they decided to book a table in Prive Cafe. The place is actually rather nice (although most taxi drivers get lost trying to reach Keppel Bay) with views of the Marina and the amazing sail boats,etc anchored in this new area of SG. However: food was ok, nothing really out of this world. Drinks: it is summer time and they did not have cold diet cokes. Buckets of ice were needed if you wanted a refreshing drink. Service: I think they would be better off having a self-service restaurant, at least they would save themselves the money they pay to those people that were standing there doing not much..
4
Nice venue for lunch during the weekdays, especially for those working nearby. Quiet and nice view of Keppel Bay. Menu has a wide selection of food. Friendly and helpful staff who will drop by to check and ensure everything is fine. Perhaps, not very crowded during lunch on a weekday. Availability of indoor and outdoor seating. Overall, a nice place for food with friends, colleagues and loved ones
2
This restaurant has a great location at Keppel Bay and its perfect for a leisurely meal, while having a great view of the bay. Both the outdoor and indoor seating areas are nicely done up, with a great ambience. It is also kid friendly with a mini playslide in the outdoor area as well as a colouring corner indoors. Unfortunately the food did not cut it for us. We had brunch and everything was very average, even without considering the price we paid. The eggs royale was average, the pancakes was dry, the omelette was tasteless. Coffees were ok but not great. It would be fairly acceptable if the pricing was lower, but there are just lots more great breakfast places around. Service was not the most friendly and staff made it fairly clear that the moment you are done with your meal, its time to go. Not a place I would come to again for the food. The service did not win us over either
2
We went here for a late lunch. The venue is lovely. However my husband's fish was not fully cooked and the batter was nice. The food was also a bit expensive for what we got. Disappointing and we won't be back.
5
Excellent service and food!! This is my 2nd visit and I'm still loving their food, service and of course the atmosphere! Celebrated my friend's birthday at Prive this time round and everyone really enjoyed themselves. Thumbs up for the staffs service!
3
é waitress forgot é order 4 our kid; only when asked, then they discovered they did not send é order!
5
Went during lunch time. View was great with cool breeze and a rare sight of all yachts. Will definitely go during dinner time for my next visit.
5
Relax breakfast at Prive. They even provided a complimentary slice cake for birthday. Thank you very much!
4
Located on Keppel Island on the southern end of Singapore, this restaurant has an amazing location by the waterfront which is more private than Sentosa Cove which has a lot more restaurants. Food and service are reasonable if you are there for its location which is all so perfect for a romantic meal or drinks under the stars
4
Had a raging hangover when I went to Prive so I was desperate for a strong coffee and a heavy breakfast. I wasn't disappointed with either. Very friendly service from Nancy. I likes the little kids play area and equipment for my 2 kids. Nice to go for a walk around the Marina afterward. Innovative kids menu. Reasonably priced for Singapore
3
3 adults and a baby, Seated quickly, attended to quickly, drinks came quicklyUnfortunately the time to get the food quite long and they got 2 of the orders wrong (side order of spinach and mushroom never came but mums ham omelette became a spinach and mushroom omelette)They offered to change but due to time restraints and needing to feed the baby we went with what we were served. We did ask for them not to charge us for the sides which never came)Bill came with the side order included and took about 10min to resolve so just waiting around.Food and setting was nice, staff were very good, service a little let down by the missed orders and trying to resolve.Would hit this place again as not a bad experience but would hope it didn't happen agai
5
Located at Keppel Bay, Prive has amazing desserts and brunch items to sample. Their chocolate desserts are amazingly rich and decadent. The view is also relaxing as you get to enjoy the scenery of the bay. The only comment of criticism I have to say is the distance to reach the restaurant so be prepared to walk if you're coming via bus

Breakfast birthday celebration. Waited five minutes before the hostess even acknowledged our presence. Very inefficient process as the reservation book seemed to be at a different desk than the entrance, involving much walking back and forth. Nice table by the water. Another lengthy wait for a server to take our order. He repeated our order so quickly he was difficult to understand. I ordered an omelette with what the menu said was an additional "topping", but it came on the side instead. Curious. The food, overall, was excellent and plentiful. Two milkshakes in our order were delivered at the end of the meal, despite two pleas to deliver them sooner. I don't expect to have to get up and chase someone to serve my food. We would probably go back for the food and the ambiance, but definitely not for the service. Shame. It could have been a first class meal but it wasn't

Awesome ambience to relax and catch up with friends. Selection of food was adequate and reasonably priced.

This is a great place to bring your out-of-towner friends for Sunday brunch. Overlooking the numerous yachts parked in the Keppel Bay harbor, the view of this place alone could make up for the fact that the food is decidedly average. If you are willing to pay 25 SGD of corkage fee, you can also BYOB and enjoy your bottle of wine. It is a family-friendly restaurant, so don't expect the place to be calm and quiet.

We stumbled upon this place and it's quite a charming oasis. Nestled in the midst of the Marina with Harborfront on one side and Sentosa in the other there was a nice enough view of people's luxury yachts. The food was also good and reasonable though I must warn that between 9-11:30 there are only 5 or 6 breakfast items which was the only disappointing feature. Also I ordered the Eggs Royale and it was just the eggs and I think toast which seemed to me a bit bare for a main dish.However, there was a wide assortment of pastries, desserts and drinks to make up. Therefore, I do recommend to go for a later lunch slot as opposed to an earlier brunch one. There's also a little play area that kept our youngster happy. Definitely a nice place for a family, we will certainly be bac

We went there for Sunday brunch and had tried to book earlier but they were not taking any more reservations. However got a table fairly quickly. But nobody took the order for more than 25 minutes.Food was good though. The location and the view are great. Their outdoor seating is ample and comfortable

On the waterfront with a refreshing breeze this a great spot to relax and enjoy some comfort food.We selected from the breakfast menu and I can certainly recommend the "Elvis french toast" this is a popular place so at weekends you may to wait for 10 minutes or so to get a table, but worth the wait

Made a reservation to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday at Privé and it was a well-made decision. The best takeaway from Privé cafe is its prime location in Keppel Bay that allows you to enjoy the beautiful scenery and yacht setting. Best time to go will be around 5 i guess as you can sit and watch the yacht setting transform in the setting sun. Definitely a very romantic ambience to the cafe.Food itself was also above average. We were totally taken away by their new dessert Cookies and Ice Cream Tower, which consisted of 2 layers of large Chocolate cookies and 3 scoops of ice cream in between, topped with a massive meringue layer. Simply guilty pleasures. Service was also excellent. The staff took the effort to answer all enquiries to the menu and also recommended the dessert which we thoroughly enjoyed. After dinner you can walk over to Keppel Bay pier and enjoy stargazing too. Will love to come back again

This cafe has one of the best locations in Singapore and therefore you would think the service and food would be at a high standard. Sadly, I think this restaurant relies on its location to attract customers as our experience was terrible. Firstly, the service is terribly slow, on several occasions I had to play "hunt for the waiter" as there was no one to be seen. When the waiter did appear she was friendly but the frustration of trying to locate her was irritating. Secondly, the food we ordered was average. I ordered an omelette with cheese, ham and mushrooms, it arrived with no ham and the mushrooms in a small bowl??? My wifes ordered basic scrambled eggs and bacon and her meal arrived after I had finished mine. Her eggs came in a small bowl and on a separate plate was her bacon, no points for presentation here!! She asked for her eggs to be made without milk as she is lactose intolerant...... and they came with milk in them (she was sick in the afternoon). It seemed like there was no leadership at the cafe as quite a few other tables weren't satisfied. Finally, the last negative. They have a lady doping face painting for children right in a busy section of the cafe, surely this can be moved to a more spacious area so that people eating don't have wild kids with face paint screaming around their table?? I'm not going bac
