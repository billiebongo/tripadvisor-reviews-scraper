The food quality is there, and the price is reasonable. The service and atmosphere are both above average. We went there twice, specially like the dumpling with pork and jyajya men (Japanese style Zha Jiang Mian) Recommended!!!
4
I like gyoza so it is almost 100% probability when I'm close to ION at the dinner time I will have gyoza in Gyoza-Ya.
This time I tried Kimchi and Truffle gyoza which was a good choice.
3
When I'm around always stop for some gyoza,the service is quite fast and the price are ok,have also promo for beer
2
order total 6dishes. gyoza came in 10min but sushi waited for like 20min and was told that they did not received the order. if did not received the order why there is 1st dish and drink being served. ridiculous and restaurant it's not crowded. service staff not attentive enough as can tell from table there is only 1 dish being serve for so long. not even to check.
3
Tasty, but portions were small for the price. We ordered the truffle ramen and my wife, who is a small eater at times, still felt hungry. I had the braised pork with rice, which was the same size, but almost half the price. The onsen egg was lovely though.We also ordered the pork, and pork with vegetables gyoza, and preferred the former
3
Title says it all. Great food, but overpriced for what it is. I came here with my mother and we had Takoyaki and Miso Mentai Gyozas with a spicy pork ramen to share. Ramen was average, but the gyozas were delicious especially the gyozas with mentai topping! It was so rich and flavorful, I'm still craving it now. Service was quite good, but gyozas took abit too long to arrive at our table. Total waiting time for those gyozas was about 20 minutes. We had already finished eating our bowl of ramen and still waited for the gyozas for awhile. I would still come back for the mentai gyoza, but maybe only that? Everything else was quite average for me
3
Came here for lunch today with a friend and opted for a selection of gyoza and some other small dishes. Servings were small but service was efficient. Gyoza was tasty but a little expensive for lunchtime. Not much change from $50. There's much better value for lunch in the area (places that actually offer lunch sets)
3
The title summaries it. We enjoyed the pork and vegetable gyoza. The pork gyoza is certainly the star. We had the bara chirashi which consisted of raw salmon, cooked prawns, crab stick, squid bits and seared mini scallops. It was terrible. Lesson for us: stick to gyoza at a gyoza shop.
2
Went to the Robinsons branch for lunch. Ordered glazed eel on rice. Minute quantity of tasteless eel served lukewarm on barely warmed up rice. My BH ordered seafood ramen- she got a tiny amount of noodles, two microscopic shrimp and five clams all floating in an oversalted broth. We shared five "Red Crab" gyozas which were barely warm and tasted only of "fishiness". Service was agreeable enough but had to remind staff to bing me my order as it was sitting on the kitchen counter cooling down rather than in front of me, going down. Three poor snacks for over Sing $40. Will never return
3
Wouldn't call it a gem but it's a hidden restaurant located at the basement of Robinsons. Ordered a few dishes to share among three as the portion was really small. The bill came out to be quite expensive just for a few side dishes. Would not return again since the taste was very average
2
Small portions, bad service, order in iPads only to find out that the item is 'sold out'. About 20-30% of the menu was sold out on the day that I came.
2
Very poor service. I order drink 3 times and only come after i finished my food. Ordered the truffle gyoza as well but it just a waste of money.
5
The gyoza there is really great among the best I've ever tried. For gyoza lovers its a must go!!!!!!
3
The service at this place is excellent. From ordering your own food by ipad to the servants bringing it. The dumplings were very good; unfortunately my noodles were a bit average, both in size and quality. My female colleagues loved the green tea dessert though. It is a bit weirdly located in my opinion, seeing it is almost in the middle of a household store
5
My first time dining in Gyoza-ya at the Heeren. Its located at B1 level where Robinson's household department is and so is Marks and Spensers. We were there at about 630pm on a Sunday evening and it was not crowded yet. Had the gyozas and the skin was thin and the filling so delicious. The garlic fried rice was one the best because it was garlicky and fragrant. The noodles was done just right with a poached egg and soup as an option. I had that and the broth with miso and poached egg was the perfect ending to the noodles.After our meal, we continued with our shopping. Very convenient indeed.
4
To be very honest, we were attracted by the $5.80 price tag for 5 pieces of cheese gyoza and we decided to walk in at 9.15pm. Last order was 9.30pm. We ordered two plates of gyoza, namely the above and another with mentaiko ($8.80). They were very good, fat and juicy. We will be back for a full dinner. Young staff were friendly and attentive
2
I was looking forward to this place after reading some good reviews but was a bit puzzled why there were some negative reviews. I now know why.Service was friendly (unlike some of the other reviews). The waiting time was long as expected. The table next to us had some dishes delivered before we arrived and 30 minutes later, their final dishes came after a lot of chasing.However, what really dissappointed me was the gyoza itself. The fried ones were just not quite there. The filling had the texture of sausage filling and tasted like it too. I have had better supermarket ones. The boiled vegetable ones were better but still, I was underwhelmed.I won't be back. Osaka Osho is cheaper and significantly better
4
This chain gyoza restaurent has 4 outlets in Singapore.It was recommended by my girlfriend for a short gathering.The service is good - you order trom the given ipad. Food will be deliver to you in 5-10mins after order.It is at the basement of a busy robinsoon hereen in Orchard road.Gyoza comes in pan fried or boils.. boils one taste nicer..Ramen or rice is nice as well.Reasonable price.. Hope my photo can be uploaded..

I've been here a few times now as I typically stay at the Mariott next door to the ION mall when on business travel. I have tried all the Gyoza and the Unagi Don bowl. The traditional Pork and Veggie Gyoza are delicious; and the prices are pretty cheap. $6.50SG for a beer to boot...which is actually cheap in Singapore! Outside of the traditional Pork and Veggie gyoza, everything else is meh...but if you want a quick snack or lunch this is a great spot
5
Have you ever had yuzu soda? No? Get one here. Yuzu is a citrus from Japan and so delicious and refreshing. The yuzu soda here was awesome with little bits in the glass. On top of that, the food was a good portion and really tasty. The bara chirashi was especially good with little bits of seafood and tamago over rice. The Omigyu miso don was flavorful and a good portion size for lunch. We also had the truffle gyoza, which might be a limited time item. It was good with mushrooms inside and a truffle "baste" on the outside. Ordering here is insanely easy. You get a tablet, you scroll through the options, all with photos, and click what you want. It's very easy to get your order in. As a side note, the chairs have notches for purses to hang on. That's pretty nifty
4
I took my friend here he'd never had gyoza before so it was a real treat, it's a nice little restaurant in a food court at Ion orchard Singapore but well worth it they have a big selection and lovely as well
4
The gyoza is very good the salad fresh n crispy the deep fried Chicken is fabulous and nothing like colonel sanders variety.
The beer cold
Hate now ordering off an ipad....
4
Very good food quick service and always keen staff. The range of gyoza are great and the steamed ones are very good. Yakatori beef sticks are a little pricey but that's not an major grip. Will always return there.
3
I was here for lunch with a friend on Saturday at about 2pm, The place was relatively quiet. Food was ordered with an ipad. There were not many choices available, Gyoza, noodles, rice and some appertisers or salads. We ordered the vegetable Gyoza (Yaki Yasai) which was pan fried with mushroom and vegetable filling. Crispy and not too oily. My friend has the spicy Kaisen Ramen. It came with a few pieces of cabbage, clams and prawns. The ramen was al dente and portion was large. I ordered the Unagi don, the don had a reasonable portion of Unagi andsmall amount of rice. It would be better for the restaurant to offer a set with miso soup and some pickles on the side. If you ordered the Unagi don alone, it would not be enough to fill you up. We paid about $41 for the meal.
4
We tried this place on our shopping trip. This place was busy and crowded, however staff is friendly. You may order on iPad. Most of the nice plates from the menu were finished so we had limited options. I must say truffle mushroom dimsum was heavenly
4
Set at basement one level of the Hereen, where Robinson department store is. Friendly service, and orderly is done on iPad. Gyoza is made fresh on the spot, having a seat at the bar top gets you close to the action of food preparation and cooking. The ramen and fried rice dishes ok.
5
Terrific gyozas (Japanese style pot stickers), we tried 3 types with pork and seafood, all very tasty. Ramens (we had tonkotsu) were good enough too. Order on tablets at your table and pay at the counter, so not an uppity place. But service was quick and the food was excellent, which is what really matters. Very reasonably priced as well.Highly recommended

If you are craving to eat Japanese gyozas, you may want to check out Gyoza-ya! This is a restaurant specializing in various variations of the Japanese dumplings. They have the grilled or boiled versions. The gyozas come with pork with vegetables, just vegetables and those that come with layer of cheese on top too. The skin of the gyozas is quite thin and they use a specialized machine to insert the ingredients. I tried the gyoza with pork and vegetables and was slightly disappointed that the gyozas seem to be under grilled with no crispy edges and the color of the dumpling looks slightly pale as well. However the skin of the dumpling is thin and the amount of ingredients in the dumpling is just sufficient! The price for the gyozas is reasonable. Surprisingly the iced lemon Earl Grey tea is really nice! They have 3 outlets, one at Ion, one at Paragon and one at Heeren B1 at the basement of Robinsons. The service at Heeren that I visited was prompt and the waitress will present a tablet for you to make your orders

This was my second and third visit to Gyoza-Ya in the last year. I had lunch and supper here, eating at the bar both times. Quick meals done in <30 min.Gyoza are made in plain sight of the customers in an open kitchen using two machines. The gyoza have a crispy, well fried bottom that gives a nice crackle when you bite them. I have now tried all the types of gyoza that they offer. Photo below of the shrimp (foreground) and octopus gyoza. My favorite is the traditional pork gyoza. They have recently added tonkatsu (chicken-fried pork loin) to the menu. Ate it twice, good both times. Kirin goes well with the gyoza. They have sake as well. I will come back during my next visit to Singapore
5
Buried deep on 4th basement level at Ion Orchard is this small but wonderful spot that seems t be very popular, especially with younger people, for very good reason. The food is delicious, the priced are great and both the staff and customers are friendly. If there is a queue, wait and eat. I loved sitting at the bar and watching the cooks work. Try the dumplings, they are great
4
we visited on a whim whilst passing through the department store, we order a few to try and a beer each, a great little place to stop and rest you feet after shopping.
4
For its price point, it serves pretty decent dishes that are not short on taste. The ramen stock was rich and tasty. The jya jya raven was innovative with its dry presentation of minced pork and cucumber shavings.
5
Went for lunch, excellent food quick service - both steam dumplings and pot stickers were excellent!
5
Loved the food. Great gyoza dumplings! Have to be one of my favourite foods! Cute little place for lunch!

Gyozas are the best quintessential comfort food; they are packages of joy in each bite, and generally inexpensive. They are usually a sideshow at most Japanese eateries. But over at Gyoza -Ya, these doughy half-moons have been turned into the main event.As you would expect from the restaurant’s name, there’s a decent list of gyoza – pork, vegetable, crab, prawn. The pan-fried beauties here are delightfully plump, succulent, and juicy. Their edges seared to crisp filigrees, their seasoned interiors dense and my fav, the pork ones are pork-heavy. Service is swift and super friendly and the menu un-intimidating. Bottom line? Gyoza-Ya doesn’t serve up haute cuisine, but it does make for a pleasant spot in which to indulge in a not so- light lunch or dinner, at wallet pleasing prices.They are (to borrow a description) “softer than your lover’s thighs” and yet I won’t want to share them with my lover. This is the true truth as I say it as it is
3
It may be our 1st patronage at this over-rated Gyoza (pan-fried dumplings) outlet @ Paragon B1, Orchard Road, but definitely not #1 dumpling shop in Singapore ! Gyoza gourmets should better get their $ worth by patronizing the traditional Chinese "Tianjing Fong Khe" Dumplings stall, Peoples Park Centre, Chinatown albeit minus cool air-con comfort

Lunched here for convenience yesterday. Food was average and service was below par. No smiles around and some of the staff (think students on vacation work ) were like bored looking. Average priced compensated by small servings. Price was reasonable though. View of open kitchen is Japanese style and would be ok but you need to be sure the food ingredients are placed properly and appears clean. Staff too should be seemed as cheerful would help. But if the order to take food by the servers came from a voice that's not so pleasant please consider swapping to the younger servers.
4
We popped in here after we got a bit tired of walking out in the heat on Orchard road. They offer a delicious variety of Gyoza, and also noodles (such as ramen) and sides. I had the veggie Gyozas and they were delicious! My partner had the ramen and was quite impressed. The prices are fairly reasonable for the Orchard Road area
4
 I like the healthy JyaJya Me. They have instruction brochure on each table to teach you how to eat it. The ordering system is also impressive. Take the tablet that is hidden under the table, place your order and click confirm. All orders will be centralized and sent to the kitchen. Cheese Goyza is great eaten while hot. We finished all we ordered for two.
5
Food was fresh and tasty. Small portions but good prices . Our waiter was fabulous gave us a lot of info what to do in Singapore wished I got his name he was lovely. Not a lot of dishes to choose from but that's why it's so fresh and delicious 
4
the second time lunch at gyoza-ya, easy to order, just chose the menu from tablet..and soon our order serve on our table
4
loved it, fresh refreshing, a great place to pause a while. good service and good food, great staff and a very clever and unique ordering system, great value for money and a quality product
4
Very nice gyoza, try the mentaiko miso, mjam!! Also staff was very friendly, also to our 1.5yr old who had difficulties behaving 😀
4
Good tasting gyozas with prompt service from staff. Salmon sashimi was "okay" and the garlic fried rice was also good for small portion sharing. Overall, a good value meal.
4
Got hungry while milling around Orchard road and came across this little gem in Robinsons department store. Decided to have a nibble. Having visited Japan I recalled Gyoza meaning dumpling..... so of course I has Miso soup with pork!..... and some steamed dumplings. All was delicious and priced well. If in the area again I will certainly have another nibble ther
4
Easy eating! My minimum standard for a gyoza. Did not like the crab gyoza. Original and the one drenched in mentai are my favourites. Always pairing them with the noodles with bean sauce. The special thing about the noodle is that when you are almost done, you get to break a soft boiled egg into your bowl, add a little water and you get a perfect soup that cleans your palate. You will order your food via an annoying ipad
3
The first time I came to Gyoza-Ya, I was quite impressed! The menu is not extensive, but that's what makes it great. Because it has a limited menu, it's easier to decide on what to order and it typically means the place is good at what it makes. It had really good boiled and pan-fried gyoza and starters such as the miso eggplant and cucumber. The first time I came, I shared the ramen with my brother but was not so impressed. I found it quite ordinary and bland in taste but my brother on the other hand, thought it was decent. The second time I came (in the summer of 2015), I was shocked to find that the quality of the gyoza's had dropped! The skin had become much thicker and thus, the meat inside had become smaller. So the ratio of meat to gyoza skin wasn't proportionate, which made the overall bite too starchy. There was too much gyoza skin and so I couldn't taste enough of the meat. That being said, the starters of miso eggplant and cucumber were still as good as I remembered them to be
1
had my worst ever experience in a restaurant to Gyoza-ya at Robinsons Heeren ... customers were made to wait for extended periods even though there were seats in the restaurant, insufficient number of wait staff, tired and unfriendly, and the worst are the 'so-called' chefs who are definitely not customer-focused ... it doesn't matter that the food may be good but the entire dining experience was made into a nightmare by rude and arrogant staff!
4
We ate at at the robinsons location. The menu is quite quirky, you basically order yourself from iPads at the table. The gyozas were very good, as was the chicken nabaan. The prices are ok and there was a bit of a line of locals which must mean it's ok. We went back a second time
5
I was introduced to this place via a close friend, and ever since then i've been going back there. You just cant get enough of the Mentaiko GYOZA. It's really really good. The other great thing about the place is the jajiangmian, they provide you with all the usual stuff but once you get half way through, you can request for them to add a egg some paste for a new soup! It's a great experience. i totally reccomend this
4
Dropped by for a quick lunch. Reasonably priced for orchard road. Paid about $6 for 5 boiled pork gyozas. Maybe the miso sauce was a bit on the salty side but still, for that price along one of Singapore's most expensive streets, it's not bad.
5
What a agree find, Goya was spectacular , crab on in particular and made fresh in front of you.Garlic rice was a great accopliment and very moorish , tempura prawns nice and fresh, highly recommended place to eat.
2
Ok ramen soup, but not any more. The chicken karage was not from leg as it should be and tasted like it was cocked in old oil I'm sure some of the other Japanese shops around there is better than this.
3
I love dumplings and gyoza. But I did not like the fried pork or prawn gyoza here. The skin and the frying were good. The filling lacked the taste of meat.
The Tori Karaage was excellent. Hot, tender, and crispy skin.
5
Simply love all the gyozas that are being served here. Definitely the best in Singapore. Their other dishes like Jya Jya Men is also very nice. Simply love the Mentaiko Miso Gyoza, Originial Gyoza and also Curry Chicken Gyoza!! Brought my Mumbai friend there and she loves the Curry Chicken Gyoza so much!! Definitely worth a visit
3
Well, I love good gyoza. All kinds of fillings. Big or small. Read my Tokyo review. But this one is just average. In fact 3.5 stars I would have given if TA allowed it.+ good looking gyoza in the ok to good range+ little bit izakaya feel+ not expensive - gyoza don't taste wow - iPad order pictures do not match what's being served- red bean desert gyoza too swee
3
My experience with service at this establishment was not exactly pleasant. I'm a very reasonable customer by nature, so it pains me to say that my dining experience here was ruined by a sulky waitress who repeatedly avoided eye contact when my sister was trying to get attention. To their credit, there were two other waiting staff who were prompt with our (and other diners') requests. Nevertheless, I thought the quality of food was okkkayy...... The pork gyoza was okay, and the portions of ramen and Japanese fried rice that we ordered were small. I had a seafood ramen which consisted of a large chunk of crab stick meat. It would be plausible for them to consider offering bigger sizes of ramen/rice for a different price, of course
3
I rated it as average but in fact towards the lower rank of average because this restaurant had no service being provided. Basically everything was ordered from the ipad and all they did was just bring food to you. As for the payment, it's quite typical that we have to walk up to the counter for that.For Gyoza, yes I believe they did well. I also ordered their fried rice, tasted horrible. The rice wasn't even Japanese rice and it tasted so bland and hard.Anyway I would only go back for their gyoza but nothing else. Of course without any other expectations as well
1
My family and I visited this place for lunch whilst we were in the area. We were completely ignored by the waiting staff and had to wait at the door for around 10 minutes even though there were many free tables . When we ordered they informed us that many of the things we ordered were "out of stock " ( around 6 items out of a 20 item menu ). When our food came , the dumplings were very undercooked and blood red on the inside . Even though there were 2 plates of dumplings ready and we had ordered 2 they only gave us one , with the excuse that another table was also waiting , even though they had arrived and ordered after us , The food was quite salty , and the noodles were quite mediocre . To top it off they ended up "forgetting" about 2 of our dishes. Would not recommend this place at all
1
This Gyoza place was my family's favourite until today... This female attendant by the name of Rue Ling, ruined the whole experience ! First, we were offered the counter seating but we told her we wanted the table seating so we were told to wait for 15-20 mins as the many empty tables were under the "closed" area. I went shopping while my husband queuing. I came back after 15 mins, my husband was with his order and we were still in the queue. She approached us and offered us the counter seating again, knowing we already told her we wanted the table. I asked her why she could not give me just a table, knowing there were plenty of empty tables. She said if I wanted, I had to wait. Well, she's not happy when we asked her how long did we have to wait. She showed her attitude, as she still believed we should just sit on the counter. My husband asked her why the people in front of him were given a table seating while they wanted the counter. Her answer was ridiculous, because they were 2 people and we were 3 ! She separated the table for the 2 people and made us waiting again. We were upset at the way she treated us. She challenged us to report to her manager, slammed the menu in front of us and walked away!We did report the incident through Robinson Concierge ! They were very helpful and courteous. We hope the management on Gyoza-ya would improve their service moving forward..

Enjoyed the vegetarian food preapared & served the Japanese way we relished the Sui Gyoza Veg, Gyoza-Ya Salad & Yasai Itame & Edamame with the Japanese Kirin Beer. In Robinsons at Orchard a pleasant experience.
5
The food here is great, the best for lunch. The staff are very friendly and like to help mix and match the food based on what you are feeling you would like to have. They are very happy to work there.
4
it is located at the basement 2 of Robinson at Heeren. It serves nice noodles besides dumplings. Very reasonably price too. It is a good place to be if you are in a hurry and want something light.
4
This is a gyoza bar, meaning most selection would revolved around Gyoza - fried, steamed, with cheese, etc. The food is reasonable - around 3-6 SGD - though please be reminded that these are all small servings. The only thing I think you may share is an order of gyoza with 5 pcs. That being said, may not be for daily lunch for working people. But the place is not crowded to a good for small meetings or chitchat with friends
4
How could a restaurant only sell gyoza and a few other small menus? This restaurant is and it is selling one of the best gyoza and chahan ever! The gyoza was great bu the chahan taste even better (chahan is Japanese fried rice btw). The portion is small though, better to eat 4-5 people so you can order other types of many gyoza it has
5
What a pleasure to find this gyoza bar. We didn't manage to get a seat, but ordered for takeaway instead. The price was good, taste was delicious, we ordered one with the shrimp and was fantastic. It is really value for money, the queue can be a stress though
3
I want to give this place a better review, simply because the gyoza are awesome. But the service lets the place down so badly I just can't justify a better review. Been twice and on both occasions was ignored for some time before being acknowledged and seated, despite the restaurant not being very busy. Waiter spilled ice on our table and simply walked away; we had to get him to come back and clean it up. Out of 3 plates of gyoza ordered today, only 2 turned up, despite asking 3 times for the last plate. We gave up and cancelled the final plate. Staff seemed surly and unhappy. Despite all this, the gyoza are good. If you want a gyoza hit, head on down to Hereen... but know that the service will be a real let down
4
been in love with this place since it first opened and wasnt so crowded. hate that i have to queue now but it's total worth it. i highly recommend theTokusei Tonkatsu Udon - super tender pork belly cooked to perfection in delightful soup. all the gyozas are great too, especially the vegetable ones. cant get enough of their dipping sauce. this place is also super affordable so if you're feeling like having some good japanese food but dont want to burn a hole in your wallet, this is definitely the place to go to
5
If you are looking for fried dumplings aka Gyoza, look no further but at Gyoza-Ya. Dumplings here are served in fried or boiled versions. The succulent fillings make the dish perfect. Other than Gyoza, this restaurant situated in the basement of Robinsons Orchard, also served noodles, fried rice, fried chicken, etc. Given the pricings, the serving size is just right for one person, not too little nor too much. A good place to nurse hungry stomach after shopping
4
This place is hidden in the basement of The Heeren department store. Fast food Japanese style at its best. The speciality is very tasty Gyoza fried or steamed. You can choose from Prawn, Pork or Vegi. We had smoked aubergine for starter. The Marcha ice cream with bean soup however strange it sounds is a perfect desert. The place is crowded with locals but you will be served in no time. Highly recommended
