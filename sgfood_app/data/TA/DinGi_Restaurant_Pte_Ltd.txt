Not easy to find healthy and fresh noodles these days. Really glad that places like Dingi still exists in these days of mass produced nutrients-deficient fast food choices.

I went to Din-gi noodle again on my last trip to Singapore.
This time I tried the Single strand noodle, a single 10 metre long noodle, measured and cut from an even longer noodle. I tried the noodle with minced pork. It was nice.

We went to Dingi noodle house today with my family, I ordered their dumpling, ' Chong Qing ' noodle and beef noodle, omg, both of the noodles were just so tasty. Good fine we will definitely go back again.

Noodles these days that are hand-made are hard to come by. The taste and quality of the Dan Dan one strand noodles exceeded my expectations. Will likely to return to try the other choices soon.

I stopped at this restaurant in the basement at Plaza Singapura for a light meal.I tried some noodles with pork and chilli. Here they have a choice of noodles, Knife Sliced (roughly cut flat noodles), Thin Noodles, and One strand noodle. I tried the Knife sliced noodles.After I had ordered, I realised that the One strand noodle was a single noodle ten metres long !Next time I have to try it. While leaving I saw the chef measuring the single noodle, pulling and stretching his arms as he did so like a taylor measuring cloth.I also had dessert. Iced clear jelly with black sugar (caramelised sugar). Simple but nice

Visited this place twice. In the basement of Singapore Plaza DinGi offers up a range of noodle dishes, cold vegetable sides, pan fried baozi and dumplings. Ordering is via a tablet attached to your table and apart from some difficulty on our first visit (which the waitress helped with straight away) this is a smooth process. There are various options including wonton noodles, beef, chicken. You can also choose what sort of noodles (pulled/ lamian, knife cut, or single noodle). The portions are good and filling, with plenty of veggies along with the noodles, broth, meat etc. There are lunch and dinner set meals. The dinner set is any bowl of noodles, a cold veg side, a drink (hot/ice tea, hot/cold soya milk, lemon ice tea), and a jelly pudding which I liked a lot, even though I'm not normally a fan of these things. Service was quick and paying/ leaving as simple as going up to the counter. Dinner for 3 came in at between SGD35-55 depending including tax

We were wondering where to eat in Plaza Singapura. There are many options available here, but you know that the cost will be comparatively higher here than in the suburbs.So we found this place at Basement 2, which we know would be a little more pricey compared to counterparts in suburbs. After all, ban mian in a suburb would cost about $4 - $5 per bowl, but here the price starts from $7.90. But looking at the set meal (which is also available on weekends), you pay minimally $12 for a bowl of noodles, a side dish and a drink, all of your choice. Quite value for money in a way.These are all Chinese dishes, cooked by I presume a chef from China. They have specialties, such as the longevity noodle, which you can get at $13.90 on your birthday ( usual price is $29.90, and includes abalone, scallop and a king prawn). Another special is the one stranded noodle. A pity I don't have pictures to show this, but it is a hot favourite for patrons.Portions are reasonable and filling. The service is prompt - you order using an iPad attached to the table. And the waiter would serve almost immediately after. Food is served piping hot too.Possibly the only downside is payment modes. You can't pay by credit cards, only cash and Nets are accepted. Well, if this helps to keep business costs manageable, maybe it's a smart move after all

We had been very challenged finding vegetarian food in Singapore and no I was not going to eat Indian food outside of India. So coming across this restaurant quite by chance, for the last meal before leaving Singapore, I asked if they would do something vegetarian. They did. A very tasty dish of hand made noodles. But what we really appreciated was their allowing my friend to bring in her vegetarian pizza from the restaurant across them. We thought that was really very kind. So 5 stars to them for a lovely meal and friendliness
