Zhong Shan branch seems like shortage of manpower and food was served to the wrong table . Other then this , everything was ok .
5
Great place to chill. The roasted pork was crispy. Salted egg burger was huge. Most songs sang were in english classics which brought nostagia.
4
The food and beer is nice. Been here a couple of times before. Definitely will go there again one day.
5
Went during their free ale promotion day. No lapse in service despite the promotion, high crowds, and wet weather. Thank you for the friendliness, great food and drinks.
Cheers!

Service was pretty good...
Went extra miles for my group. My guests enjoyed themselves very much. :)
4
We had celebrated our new year countdown there. The food & beer were great. Love the live band too. Will be back soon!
4
reserved a table under chope, it’s a good place for gatherings over food and drinks. Service so-so. /
4
this bistro is one of my favourite hangout. It has a nice ambience and very relaxing. Food is pretty good too, especially the Pork knuckles

If you want to get away from the madding crowd of Clark Quay, Boat Quay especially on a Friday or Saturday, to wind down a stressful week, this place is for you. Located along the foodie street of Balestier, there is ample parking. Also very accessible via buses and Novena MRT.Basically German xuisine that goes well with German beer. There is also live music.Or let your kid romp on the grassy lawn beside while you sip a cold glass of lager

Starker serves freshly brewed beer. A group of us met up and had a great time there, enjoying our beers and reminiscing our good old days. You must try some of the signature beers. To save some costs, you can order your beers during the happy hour promotion. In addition, you can sign up as a member to enjoy some discounts off the total bill. They have a few outlets. We would usually hang out at their Zhongshan mall. If you are around the area, and a beer lover, you can try to pop over the place. A word of caution: If you drink, please do not drive! There are many taxis and private hired cars around to bring you home safely
5
Excellent with good food. We love the ambience and also the attentiveness of the service crews. Definitely will return back to try out other food items.
4
Food portion is okay. Wide choice of food. Ambience is suitable for both group or private dining. Price and service is reasonable.
5
Food was good and tasty and beer had many variety for everyone. Personal favourite was Lychee Beer. Recommend to try the pork knuckle. Music performance was wonderful with great performance on stage. Definately will go again.
5
Great atmosphere, fantastic live band. Awesome food, and some of the best beer available. Good for friends catch up and gatherings. Highly recommended!
5
Great service! Great food! Nice ambience for winding down after a long work day, with good live band!
4
Restaurant food was decent and the live band was great. The live band area is actually pretty small and separated from the main eating area.
4
Good place to chill with friends and chat over a beer and live band music. Ordered a platter, Pork knuckles and baby back ribs and fries. My friends love the pork knuckles while I like the baby back ribs. Live band is pretty good, the girl can sing.
4
Not my 1st time visiting Starker at Zhongshan Park and facing same issue. Booking was made & twice table was not reserved. This trip booking made at 4.30pm for 2nd level. Arrived & was told 2nd level section only open at 6pm. No one call to inform us and were advice table reserved below but was taken up??!! In the end they have no choice but to open 2nd level section for us. Guess they were to busy to take note of reservation made.
4
Catch up with old uni friends on Fri night @the Zhong San outlet. Pretty crowded & almost full house. House beer was v good, especially the Lychee flavoured one. 5pax downed 4L of beer with an array of Pork Knuckles, Chilli Wings, Roast Pork Belly, Lamp Rack, Cheesy Fries, Mini burgers.... No regrets checking out this new joint!!
3
I will say this place serves GREAT beer ! If you are on a business trip, staying in hotels nearby... nowhere to go, this is certainly a great place to be for dinner and a pint or 2 of beer.Great service and a great live band as well. Just a pity, they had not even heard of a very popular Chinese song that I requeste
3
Hoped for a great evening out for a friends birthday...instead got average food, service and atmosphere:(
It’s a Shame as the place looks great but...
Also why only one toilet for such a huge place where everyone is drinking beer!?Not well thought out at all!!!
4
This place is great for hanging out with friends. Although they offer slightly costlier alcohol, the ambiance makes up for it.
5
Great spot to sit and unwind by the park - quiet - lots of young locals - not touristy !! Try the lychee beer
5
Nice beer, good food. Enjoy the evening with my friends. Will bring my family there one of the day..
4
Happy hour promotions are good. We usually order a crate of beer. The beer tastes good. Vegetarian options are limited (only pizza).
5
Service was prompt. They also came to offer a new frosted mug for my friend when they noticed his pint had been sitting for some time. Food was good, though the meat could be more moist. Beer was fresh! Had the Lychee one and it's really great
3
Staying at a hotel next door we thought give the bistro a try, not much else of any quality near by but good service and good beers, food also good.service very quick for my liking a little too quick!! like to choose and relax a little, but not complaining, very strange they bought out all the food in one go, but this appears to be a Singapore thing, we had starters and mains and sides all on table at the same time........glad we did not order dessert :):). good selection of craft beers, although barman needs to learn to serve a pint without 1/2 meter of head, also strange they come around and constantly decant your beer into a new glass................just leave my beer alone!!!!must try the Charcoal beer just to my liking
5
We came here on a Friday night and the place was packed with people. There was a live band playing inside, so the atmosphere was very lively.It was very pleasant and relaxing to sit on the outside, as you can see Zhong Shan park beside it.We had their lychee draft beer, which has a unique taste, and it was good.The service was excellent as the servers were constantly filling up our empty beer mugs
4
Visited with a group of 5 friends for the first time and all of us agreed that this is a good place to chill out. The food was good and we especially like the pork knuckles and of course not forgeting the lychee beer.Ambience is good except that the place is a bit narrow
4
I visited Starker with my friends to celebrate my friend's birthday. The food was great at typical prices for a restaurant-bar. Service had much to be desired as it was crowded and happening. The waiter missed out my friend's order and in turn, she had to wait almost an hour for her food to arrive after we had alerted the waiter about it.All in all, a great place to chill with friends though :
3
Not bad, good and nice. Quiet and my family like the place alot. Band was not nice but food can improve
4
Great beers that they brew themselves although selection is not that broad. Food is really good especially the ssausages, pork knuckle, and pizza
4
Nice Lychee Beer. We are pleased with the Food. Waitresses very attentive. Good plane to bring friends and family there.
5
Great place and great beer! Love the dunkel so much! Was there early and no too many people around. Overall is great!
5
Quite frequent visit this place. Food is reasonable good and ambience is very versatile. There is outdoor/indoor/live band.
5
1st time visit - very good & attentive service by a 19 yo wait staff! Beer is very fresh. The only food that we ordered -wings, was yummy!
Will definitely return real soon!
5
Had a great time with my colleagues , nice spot to relax after busy day, the sweet potato chips are awesome , really like the idea of change of glasses when beer is half over:)
3
Place is nice and staffs are very attentive & friendly. But for such a big place only one toilet which non customer also use it. Customers have to wait in line to use the toilet. Inform the manager, seems he don't have interest in it. His response is oh ok. Need to go the mall to use the toilet. Pathetic to have only one toilet. Really disappointed with the attitude from the management. Hope this can be improved. For a paying customer, and above average prices, to get the kind of attitude. This is bad, paying for an expensive place.

Went on a Thursday nite with friends to chill out. The beer was fresh and crisp, really refreshing. The pork knuckle we had was excellent at $38++. The skin is crispy but the meat was not dry but tender. However the truffle fries was not fantastic, can give that a miss. The 3 person band that performs on every Thursday night is great! Tricia the lady singer sings both English & mandarin songs so well! They also take your song requests. They have both indoor and alfresco sitting. Was really pack, maybe of the band, so should make reservation like we did on Thurs

Whenever I reviewed a restaurant , I would usually take into consideration the quality of the food and service which unfortunately this place did not excel in either.As we have a rather big group so we get to sample quit a few varieties of food there which unfortunately none really stood up to be worth mentioning which is maybe this place is really for bar snacks but then again we did order some but it just did not leave an impression.Among the bar snacks, I would rate the wings above average as it does not come oily and the sweet potatoes fries is too bland and turn soggy quickly.Among all the main course we ordered, none of these is also worth mentioning which is a surprise as we have almost 10 of them!!The service is not attentive and what makes me a little annoyed was when I passed an empty bottle to be refilled with water , the staff asked what I want it to be refilled with!!! Can't be beer right ?Overall just an average place for dining though on the night we visited it was very crowded
5
The atmosphere is great for hanging out with friends and family. There's life band on the first level. Wide selection of food and drinks. The service was great, too. We'll keep coming back for sure.
4
The food and the beer was good. The pizza and the pork knuckles were delicious while having it with the Lager. Overall my family enjoyed the ambience too.
5
great place for chill out. great music and ambience.
Love how the servers always making sure your beer is chill.
great service
4
Came here for a late dinner. They’re one of the few places open late in this area. The food was good, service was excellent. They’re located at the park, so the view during dinner is pretty.
4
The food and beer were good, especially the Lychee beer which the ladies would love. However it was not worth it to get softdrinks ($5 for a glass).
4
Good beer and food with friendly service staff, value for money with member discount and happy hour price
4
2nd time here but 1st time at this outlet. Food is not bad but menu is not 100% reflective of the food.
5
I always love to hang out at Starkers Zhong Shan Park. The guys servicing at this outlet are friendly as compared to the other outlets. Atmosphere is great, and my friends & I enjoy sitting right in front of the bar. But it is quite warm lately especially when the place gets crowded.
5
This has got to be one of my favorite (new) places to hang out (apart from the fact that it is literally 10mins walking distance from my place). We all know the beer and food Starkers carries and the standard is equal, if not better, than the other Starkers. What makes it worth going - the fantastic service and chill ambiance. The service staff (or at least the 2 waiters serving our table outside) were friendly, attentive and prompt (but... they owe me a birthday song). The ambiance as good, totally windy, chilled and really a great place to unwind. Would definitely continue to support this branch (ZhongshanPark @ Balestier)
4
Located at Zhong Shan Park, it offers great ambience and good food. The waiting time for the food to be served was very short. Beer was served in ice-cold mug which makes the drinking experience even better. I tried the fish and chips and I find it to be good. The tartar sauce that comes with it compliments the fish and chips very nicely. There is a live band that starts playing at 8pm. Do come to this place to chill out.
5
Good beer as always. However service was a bit slow as they were quite full. My pint took 15 minutes to come.
5
The ambient is great. It's just next Ramada hotel. A live band music and an extensive menu of bar bites can be found here. I just like the fresh beer here......
4
Away from city feel. Chill w beer, snacks and live music. Friendly staff. Change ice cool beer mug every few minutes.
5
Great food, good music, excellent beer. Had a great time with a bunch of merry friends. Will visit again.
5
Overall service is good and food is nice. Price is reasonable too. Will visit again in the near future.

It's my 2nd time ordering the molten chocolate lava cake. And I requested for it to be warmer as the previous time when I ordered it, it wasnt warm at all. The lava cake was already broken when they served it, and I thought that could be the reason because I requested for it to be heated up more. But it wasn't even lukewarm. I had a bite and returned it. The service staff didn't even bother asking why, when they saw the dessert was returned in almost food condition. Was really disappointed by this lackluster service attitude. Just keep to their bar snacks and beers, which they are known for.
4
Starker serve freshly Brewed Beer that is smooth and fresh. Would Personally recommend the Charcoal and Lychee Beer.Register as a member and get 15% discount anytime of the year, alternatively go before 8pm on weekdays to enjoy the happy hour ratesThe Beer quality is worth the price but the food prising is on the high side and the Kitchen is a bit slow in serving the food.Would recommend the Beer and not the foo

We were there for dinner on 15 April - Saturday. Most of the food items were still good except the Clam Vongole which was full of sands! Services (we were sitting at 2nd floor) were indeed disappointing by the 2 staff stationed at the floor, to be fair, there were a several cheerful staff appeared occasionally to deliver our food, unfortunately they were not on duty for 2nd floor. The young waiter & waitress who were supposed to 'take care of' customers upstairs had successfully made me feel that we owe them a living after begged for water, failure to get my bill after several attempts to even get my bill! Had to walk downstairs to request for our bill.. indeed sad for the short change for this bistro experience with service charge though.
3
This is a nice place to have a more western style meal. We had steak, mashed potatoes and vegies and of course beer. We sat outside on the patio and it was beautiful. The wait staff was effective but all seemed very confused as to what was their responsibility. Over all it was a good experience but the wait staff needs some direction
4
Come hungry to this restaurant. Lots of outdoor seating, where dogs are also allowed, or choose to sit inside. They have live music. You can get a sampler 'platter' of all their types of beer, or just enjoy trying different ones. There is even one that has fruit in it. The food is very good - the crispy pork knuckle is huge so think about sharing that! Great sausages too - and most all come with potato and gravy - true comfort food! Be sure to ask for the side of greens as the meals come with only the tiniest bit of lettuce leaves. You cannot walk away hungry
5
Fresh & tasty beer with delicious food. Tried sausage, king prawn & seafood pasta, all are fantasic.. services are warm & friendly even on a busy Friday night. Amazing
5
Food and service was excellent, including the atmosphere and all the staffs was friendly and prompt in responding.
5
I always prefer wine to beer but the beer here is fresh and refreshing. Service is always good. Will return again! We love the snacks too. Yummy!!!
5
Starker can always be relied on for fresh, great tasting beer and delicious pub food. Great atmosphere
5
Great place for a wind down with a pint and good pub grub. There is also live bands at times. I love the beers here.
4
Service was excellent , frost mug was change frequently... Food was delicious .. Great place for hanging out
5
Nice ambience, great good and delicious beer! Staff seems abit new to the line, but attentive. Generally speaking a great visit.
4
Was there last weekend with friends, the service crew were nice and friendly. The lychee beef and BBQ rib was good. The rest of the sides we ordered was normal. The live band consists of 2 youngsters, a guy and a lady. They play Chinese, Cantonese and English songs, very good standard from my perspective. We enjoyed ourselves.But the damage was relatively high given we ordered during happy hours
3
The upper floor of this bistro has a pleasant ambience. I had the sous vide chicken roulade, which was tender enough but could have done with a little more salt. The only flavourful parts of the dish were the sautÃ©ed greens! While the staff were polite, service could have been a little more prompt, such as in the refilling of water
5
Came here with my BFF. We have an enjoyable night eating and drinking beers here. The crowd and the live band is good. The service was good too. What l like is each they pour your beer they change the mug into an ice cold one. Which mean each time your beers is ice cold. I would recommend to give this place a try when near.
