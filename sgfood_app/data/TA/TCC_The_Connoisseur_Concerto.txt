For coffee lovers, TCC cold brew coffee has its unique, strong and real coffee taste. It comes with iced, milk and syrup for your personal choice!

Such a beautiful selection of fresh drinks! I opted for the avocado and mint smoothie --- super refreshing! Expensive @ $20 for 2 drinks but I guess that's Singapore!

I started with a coconut & banana juice and then a flat white. Both were excellent and reasonably priced consisting it is in a serious tourist precinct. Attentive but unobtrusive service.

This is a great little restaurant in the Marina Bay Sands shopping center, Great Service, best of all the coffee is very good, and the Gourmet dishes were very good, well presented, great menu, and nice small portions, perfect. Have interesting dishes that will appeal to every-ones taste and the prices are fair. Will diffidently be going back, when in Singapore again

We had coffee and some moon cakes (snow skin) with cold brewed and iced coffee soy latte. All just not to my liking. Cold brewed coffee was strong but not the usual coffee taste. The iced coffee soy latte I almost can’t taste the coffee. The only consolation was the French fries, it’s simply delicious. I feel this place is an expensive place to get unusual taste of coffee.

Staying near Robertson Quay, TCC was one of a few restaurants open for lunch. There were 3 of us and we ordered a beef burger, chicken burger, and the seafood pasta.Service was adequate, although when we asked for ketchup to go with the French fries, we given only a one ounce portion. I guess they are rationing ketchup here.All the dishes were quite good and better than I had anticipated

Very spacious layout, with plenty of space for larger gatherings. The staff were pleasant, but were a little inexperienced with the menu items which detracted from the overall quality of the experience. The food is excellent. We ordered a couple of pastas (prawn and a crayfish) which were delivered in large portions. The taste was refined and well balanced to let the natural sweetness of the seafood shine through. For the price of the food alone it was a little expensive, and the service was sub-par making it difficult to recommend. If staff were better trained, TCC could really be a great place to dine out

We had dinner at TCC @ GreatWorld shopping mall. My sister and I were craving for our favourite crayfish salad which is done to perfection always at TCC (tried several places but none comes close). We ordered our usual favourite and 2 seafood alio olio (cooked al dents so it's really firm and tasty). We had fresh avocado juice but personally I think with a dash of lemon would add to the taste. Service was attentive and friendly, especially Hailul (sorry if the spelling is incorrect). Will definitely recommend to friends.

We went to MBS to see the ballet at the Mastercard theater and stopped by TCC-- a reliable standby in Singapore for bistro food.Had the special chicken mushroom roulade and smoked cod pasta specials. Portions large and yummy for Singapore standard taste. Only disappointment was my grapefruit yuzu soda that had canned peach in it and did not taste of grapefruit or yuzu. Way too sweet.It is telling that on a Wednesday evening opening for the ballet that TCC was the most crowded and filled with locals compared with the luxury restaurants by signature chefs around us which were empty.Leave that for the out-of-town high rollers and go to TCC for a reliable meal at half the price of other MBS outlets and use the money to upgrade your theater seats instead

We were looking for a place for a late dinner. We walked along the river from our hotel and picked this restaurant. We ordered a shrimp spaghetti and a pasta. Both were delicious. The decor is contemporary and it provides a nice atmosphere for dinner without loud music. Service is good. The price is a bit on the high side

We paid twice what we pay in Australia for our coffees. And they were basically very poor. Sorry but if you like Italian espressos and cappuccinos then look harder.

Burger and chips were fine, can't choose doneness level though.
Expensive but that's Clarke Quai after all. The only down side was the bun, which was very soggy.

Always have a good variety of drinks menu; with a new drink introduced from time to time. Like the food options too. Being a vegetarian, helps me decide what food I can consume cause of the vegetarian symbol.

Family lunch and we ordered 5 dishes- mushroom soup, scallop baked rice, black beef burger & fries, steak with sunny side up eggs (breakfast section) and prawn mentaki pasta. All were fantastic!
Worth the trip.

Stopped here from a quick bite to eat, beautiful Wagu beef burger for $18 with a wee salad and chips. Totally great value for money

Our general comment is that the variety on the menu has shrunk. choice of steak entrees is less than previous menus. Nevertheless great taste still.
The uploaded photo shows the new Egg Soufflé - part of the all-day breakfast menu.

Charmimg & comfortable cafe ambiance. Menu catering for the sweet and indulgent tooth! Gourmet coffees giving interesting descriptions and a wide variety of other drinks. Plating of food a little prescriptive - but look like the menu pictures.

What a wonderful experience this place was. My granddaughter insisted I go here on my first trip to Singapore. I was not disappointed, the food was simply the best I have eaten. The waiter was so polite and helpful. The place is quaint a just a delight. You can sit outside or inside. Love love love it.

Service very slow, waited for waitress to stop talking on the phone, until we were seated. Ordered the Chicken and Mushroom pasta. The Chicken was that processed Chicken made to cut thinly for cheap sandwiches and at 23 SNG D. Disgusted. Had to ask for my coffee after my food was already delivered.
