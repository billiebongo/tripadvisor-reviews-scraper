Can't remember which one I had but I had some sort of ramen. I was quite impressed . The interior is quite nice also with its Japanese style. Pricing was reasonable. I would go again

This is one of the hidden gems at Robertson Quay area. I tried my first bowl of tsukemen (ramen dipped into separate bowl of soup) in November and it was really a filling meal. They come in sizes of 150grams or 200grams if you are a big eater. So i came back in December craving for more noodles and tried the usual ramen in pork broth. Tastes pretty good too. Strongly recommend to download the JPassport app for great deals and discounts

Had lunch at Daikokuya - went for Ebi Curry. The portion is quite small but presentable. There are quite a number of choices in the menu. Setting is traditional Japanese ramen place more or less. Price is a little bit steep when compared to portion. Worth trying at least once.

Came here for ramen and i was very impressed by the quality of the food. The sliced pork was just to die for, it breaks apart easily and melts. Did an add-on of prawn oil to the broth itself as it was recommended by my foodie friend. The broth became simply amazing and i finished the entire bowl in minutes.No questions ask, i will be back here again

They have quite a variety of ramen, and even rice dishes, such as curry katsu, salmon don, unagi don etc. So for those who don't really like ramen, you can still dine at Daikokuya!~The interior looks very classic japanese style, with booths accomodating 4-6 pax. The manager strongly recommended that we try the Roasted Miso ramen $15++, and I was glad that I did, because it was the most flavourful of the 3 types of ramen. The other two were Rich Shio $12++ and Roasted Shoyu $12++. The char siew slice given was slightly on the fatty side, which I didn't enjoy too much.Shio, The Shio ramen had the least flavour, but it was still strong in my opinion. The Shoyu had more flavour than the shio, but still less than the Miso. So if you like your ramen broth strong, just go for the Miso.The egg was okay, just tasted like any normal egg you would get at a ramen place.I decided to try their Salmon don, but was so upset to realize upon my first mouthful, that the rice was not japanese rice, instead, it was American rice, as later clarified by kitchen staff. What?! American rice? I am confused. The salmon was also quite dry.Would I come back here? Possibly, if I wanted ramen and was in the vicinity..
