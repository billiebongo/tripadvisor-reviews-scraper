Foods are generally good. The only suggestion is for those that not familiar with Korean bbq, can try to find out on how to really grill and eat it in Korean style first haha.

It's my first time eating with my friends for gathering.
Cost for $25/pax weekend, public holiday and dinner daliy
$18/pax weekdays for lunch only

Good staff from korea, she teaches us how to grill the meat, and how to eat like an original korean , free drinks, wifi and ice cream

I am a kind of meat lover person although my boyfriend likes vegetable. That day is Sunday and we've planned to meet cousin, friend and aunt. Total pax is 5 and we enjoyed our dinner. I like to eat pork belly and meat while others love to eat meat with vegetables. There are different type of sauce you can choose according to your taste. I drank 3 cups of peach drink. The drink is good soft drink with pink color. I don't know how to write review. While I writing this review, I really missed the taste I had at there. There is one thing I like this restaurant is that they change the hot plate when it becomes dark

Visited this in last December 2016, make a reservation 6 pax for lunch. It was weekday lunch, not much crowds. Greeted by a lady with big smile on her face. Price is definitely worth it as it was $SGD15++. Food replenish was quick. Raw and Cooked food is fresh. What amaze me is the service is super good every 20min to 30min, they would change the new grilled plate for us to enjoy. Help us to take pictures without us asking them. There was even 1 free melon ice cream for dessert for each paying pax. Great for Family dinners!

The discount Buffet on Sunday costs $20/adult. Value for money based upon the assortment of dishes offered. The condiment range is not as varied as some of the more posh Korean restaurants. Anchovies and seaweed pickles were absent, as was Kimchi Soup. Must try is the delicious Soju @ $15/bottle, which serves about 10 tiny cups. The ice cream is superb but extra at $1. Not as diverse as Seoul Korean BBQ, but has pork on the menu. Attentive service

Me and my husband try this Korean BBQ buffet because during Monday to Thursday they have a promo of SGD$14.00 ++ per pax. We end up paying SGD$35.00 for the 2 of us (PHP1,190 - conversion depends/at this time its x php34). The male in the reception was all smile when we arrived. There's a choice of pork, beef and chicken to grill. Free drinks, soup, a little selection of veggies, kimchi, chicken sausage, rice, sliced oranges, dips and that's all. Not much, but if you're just craving for a BBQ, their bacon strip is a must. As of this writing they have two (2) locations in singapore. One is in Bedok Point and Tampines. Really worth it if you are on a budget. Place is clean and surprisingly not smokey at all but, be sure to bring extra shirt as the smell of grill meat clings to your clothes
5
We arrived there at 11.30 am and we can start grilling the meat, but I dont know how to grill and eat well, so i ask one of the staff and she teaches us how to grill till the meat is done and how to eat like an original korean people with lettuce wrapping. There are also many side dishes, drinks, and free ice cream. The price is awesome, only 16++ per person and you can eat till you are full
4
The spread is more than adequate for the price you pay. Meats are very good, and they have a small selection of cooked food as well (including two choices of soup). I would forgo the squid...it could be our cooking skills, but after a while, the squid looks and taste like rubber bands. There were prawns too but it is not as big as I like it to warrant the effort of peeling... Drinks free-flow but I only like the sugarcane (I think)...which is the only drink that has flavor...the rest are more like colored water. Place was packed when a bunch of overseas exhibitors from Suntec arrived. Our BBQ iron plate was changed regularly, do watch out for the fire...instruction on the knob is in Korean, so better to check with the servers. The buffet items are replenished regularly, so don't worry and start dashing for the good stuff when it is out. For a short while, they have to opened the windows as it got really smokey, and yes, you will leave smelling like what you ate...All in all, I would return, good food and service, value for money
5
I came here with a large group, and the restaurant was more than accommodating. Not only was the service good, but the quality of meat and selection were fantastic. I really enjoyed sharing this experience with my peers. Especially the way meats are cooked and eaten
5
Very good for value
Unlimited BBQ meat and hot food to eat within a limited time
Good place for a gathering with friends
5
The food are all sumptuous! All the meat were tastefully and carefully marinated. They also offer fruits.
5
This place shows the latest kpop mtv on the tv, and the food is not bad. It all depends on ur own cooking skills and the way you mix the sauce. Remember to wrap all the meat in vegetables for a healthy meal
3
Not your friendly staff restaurant, with long waiting queues (probably because the food is okay and price is actually quite reasonable).
4
Huge all you can eat Korean BBQ selection incl fish and prawns for SGD 25++. Grab a Korean beer and some soju from their fridge, ignore the idiotic music videos on the TVs and dig in. Very full, very popular, seems like Koreans go here too.
4
I love well marinated Korean BBQ meat, least the BBQ smell that get on your body, clothes and hair!The marinated meat was very tender, juicy and awesomeeee! Though it also depends on how well can the person cook! If all else fail on the raw meat, you can always go for the cook food! Its equally tasty and delicious as well!Free flow drinks and food for 2 hours, way enough time for any meal. Will visit again should I not mind the BBQ smell on my clothes, hair and body
4
Although there are not much dishes to choose from compare to other Korean buffet, but the meats are very well marinated and tasty. They also have other side dishes such as maki, onion rings, japchae, Tteokbokki, etc, in case you are tired of meats. Personally I love their beef bulgogi, can’t get enough of them. Service is generally good and it is quite easy to get the servers’ attention. Highly recommended but be prepared to queue if you have not made any reservation
5
We liked this place a lot. The ingredients look very unassuming, but once you grill them you realise that they are all very nicely prepared in all sorts of tasty marinades. The selection of drinks is a bit meagre, but okay. My son and I went here twice, the first visit being on our first evening in Singapore. That was a funny experience, since we did not realise what we needed to do and just ate delicious but already prepared chicken, vegetables, noodles and some other goodies. Staff, when they realised that we were not going to actually do a proper barbecue went running around us all excited and totally astonished. In the end they cut our bill in half and charged us only for one person. So if you want to do it on the cheap, try this technique. The second time we did it properly and were well pleased. And make sure to take their amazing (low fat) green ice cream when you leave

My friend and I considered a few other BBQ places in Chinatown, but based on reviews decided to try this one. We were not disappointed! Some of the ribs had too much fat, but we found the cuts we liked and walked away satisfied. Make sure to grab a melon ice cream bar on the way out. It came to $28 sing dollars each for a weekend buffet
5
They got the meat variety and shrimps (freshly dead)
and at $35 per person, we shall return. Great service too!
4
What a great little find here in Chinatown Singapore. Fresh, healthy and delicious. The only reason I didn't give it top marks is because i would have liked a larger selection of Veges to grill, otherwise it was great!
4
Been wanted to try~ At last, I get to try it last Decemeber with my cousins and niece, celebrated our birthdays (December babies) over buffet lunch in Ssikkek Junction 10. Great meat choices and even some seafood.
4
The korean beef set meal is very nice and come with miso soup and kim chee. The Ramen is nice too but too spicy for me as it is chilli hot
3
Visited Ssikkek @ Tanjong Pagar Branch on New Year's Eve with my family.The price is reasonable at $22++ for adults and $16++ for child. I have walked pass this restaurant many times and saw many people queuing. So I decided to bring my family there to have our last meal of 2014. As expected there were many people but since we are early (6:20pm) we managed to get in before the next reservation.It is located on the second floor. The restaurant is kept clean by a crew of about 6-8. The hotplate that you barbecue your food on is lay with aluminimum foil. There is no grease or butter provided so you basically have to start off with bacon or something fatty to get some oil. The condiments spread are quite good and so are the small dishes. They are readily available as it is buffet style. There were 4 beef, 3 chicken and 6 pork selections. The only seafood is prawns.. although they were frozen prawns they look quite fresh. There are only orange and watermelon. The Enoki mushrooms are ever popular.. so where the prawns. Only lime juice and cold water is served, they do have beer and soju for you to other. The restrooms are relatively clean. The staff are quite prompt to change the aluminium foil when they see that your's need to. Although the food is decent and the spread reasonable for the price, the restaurant is not suitable for young child especially child that would run around. The restaurant is crowded and patrons are constantly moving to the buffet area to get their food

i was here last week with my colleagues who is Korean. for 24 bux plus plus i never expect much and turn out, im wrong. it has huge spread from beef, chicken, pork and they even have kimchi soup, seawee soup, chicken nugget and spring roll and drinks!what else you can ask for.?beware that you will be going out from there smell of bbq. but dont worry they do have febreeze to help you to get rid of the smell.and be prepare to wait as it can be crowded in weekend
4
Was at the Tampines branch on a weekend for dinner with a 2 hours limit for the meal.Restaurant was crowded and waited about 10 minutes to be seated.Spread was quite good and generous. My favourite is the marinated beef.There was free flow of drinks, rice and two different types of soups.Side dishes of doppoki, fried sweet potatoes, pancakes and of course kimchi.Service was good, with a grill change when necessary
4
There were 5 of us but table arrangements are only for 4 so space-wise, it's very crammed. Crowded, needless to say. Not much service to talk about, as everything is self-service. But food is just great!! Lots of meats, rice and noodles, which suits us fine as we are all big eaters! The sound of sizzling meats on the fire is enough to drive us crazy! Will definitely come back with my friends. A perfect place for young people who doesn't go for frills, doesn't expect much service, don't mind the non-service and just love to eat!

Visited their branch at Junction 10 twice recently and had a great time. The buffet is at a very reasonable price of $14++ for weekday lunch and although the selection of food is not great, their quality of food is quite good. I personally love their pork belly and chicken marinated in BBQ sauce. Unlimited drinks including soft drinks, korean tea and calamansi juice is also provided. Although the location of the restaurant is kinda out of the way (if you are taking public transport), i wouldn't mind coming back once in a while for this great value buffet.

When: Sunday DinnerWhere: Junction Ten (Woodlands Branch)Cost: $113 for 4 adultsFood Spread: good varietyMeats: Mostly non marinated which is good. Lots of pork, beef, chicken. Sliced very thinly and cooks fast.Veges: Not many varieties, but I guess it is enough. Fresh lettuce was nice.Cooked food: Interesting variety. Curry, Toppoki, Some maki, Pasta, mixed variety, plain rice, soups.... Seaweed soup delicious. Kimchi stew tasted like minestrone soup. Drinks: usual soft drinks.Atmosphere: not smoky at all. Service crew changed the grill at our request very quickly.Set-back: there was a 2-hour limit to our dining. Made us feel a bit hurried. Also, it would have been nice if ice-cream was included for free

Been to Ssikkek for plenty of times and never get bored. The BBQ meats are really good, well marinated and tender. Varieties of soups, vegetables and drinks, salads, cooked food. Can drinks (Coke etc) are relatively cheap, only $1 per can. It is a good place and a lot worth for money, make sure you come with an empty stomach, the food can really make you addicted :)Unless you don't mind your hair and clothes get smelly after, then nothing for you to complain about :) This is an average service BBQ Restaurant, do not set overly high expectation before your visit. Some staffs are really attentive while others won't even throw a smile. Come not during weekend but also not on regular hours when people are usually having meals would make a lot of differences. If you choose to come during lunch or dinner hours you might need to queue for quite a while. To avoid this, I usually come during weekdays after the regular lunch break (between 2.30pm to 5pm). Will give more space, so that I can easily pick up the food back and forth from the buffet table to my dining table, no annoying queue and less noisy, so you can eat while enjoying your food :)The same advice from me if you decide to come during the weekends
4
Had dinner at Ssikkek just a couple of nights ago! All the beef is very tasty! Good seasoning and very tender! My family especially liked the ribeye and the prawns! The prawns very fresh and reasonable sized! If you enjoy eating meat and don't mind the loud noise and average service, Ssikkek is a great restaurant for you
4
Not exactly traditional, but very worth the money ($24++); all you can eat BBQ buffet. Large spread of good cuts of meat, like pork belly, beef rib eye, bacon. So pile on the meats and start frying!Service is decent, with staff coming regularly to change the aluminium foil. Eating is limited to 2 hrs per group, so make it count. Queue is also always pretty long without reservations allowed, so you want to go down early. Note: After dining your clothes and hair will smell like a piece of bulgolgi beef, so bring a change of clothes if you're heading anywhere else preferably

In here you can really indulge in great korean bbq meat. The meat is very well seasoned and always replenished. They offer pork of various kinds, beef, mutton, chicken, apart from all kinds of additional seasoning, fresh vegetable, readily prepared soups as well as changing dishes - not to forget KIMCHI! The staff are friendly and courteous and change your bbq pan regularly to avoid burned food in your dishes.However, due to the nature of this bbq the floor is often a bit greasy and thus you must walk carefully in order not to slip. Proper detergent in the water could ease this problem, simply water to clean does not. In the evening, when you don't want to be an early bird and start eating at 5:30 it is advisable to have your reservation done on time. However, coming early has also the advantage that you could ask for a more quiet place since in general the acoustic is not the best and noise dominates the overall atmosphere.One small disadvantage is that there is a time limit for guests. Within 2 hours you have to vacate your table to give others a choice, so if you plan to have a comfortable night out with your friends you better plan ahead for the next place to have your drinks after the food. It might be necessary for digestion anyway!But despite all, I love to come back here regularly, the food is just great

There's really nothing impressive about the restaurant. When I stepped in with my friends, the first thing the waiter said was "You can only stay for 2 hours." There might be people who take advantage of buffet by lingering for ours, but for us it's a little insulting cos it made us feel that we're asking for free food, while at $15++ for lunch, it's not cheap at all.As for the food and drinks, both are ordinary. My friends really like their pork belly, but the only thing I enjoyed was the bacon. The atmosphere of the place is quite nice as there are screens that constantly plays Korean video music and the seats are not so cramped.I wouldn't say the food is horrible, it's acceptable, but I guess the place will be better suited for those who look for quantity more than quality
4
Since moving to Singapore, my husband and I have searched for good Korean bbq places. We found it here! The meat selection is good, though we favor the non-marinated meats and there are fewer options of these. The vegetables are fresh and a good variety is available. We tried some of the hot dishes which weren't very impressive but not bad (compared to some of the other places we've been). We are definitely going back when we crave meat since it's all you can eat
1
This is the 1st time I've eaten at this restaurant and this will definitely be the last time too. Forget about any service and when I requested the grill to be changed, the waitress told us that the grill was not easy to change by she had no choice when I insisted. Food was very limited, such as besides prawns, there were no other seafood at all. Even the meats choices were little.... Besides some cut watermelon, there was no dessert available. As the place was rather crowded, the staff were rushing to clear the tables for the other diners that were waiting. They kept coming to our table to ask if we had finished eating and wanted to clear our table too even though we were still chatting and not ready to leave. With this constant asking from the staff, it gave me the feeling that I was being rushed to ask for my check and leave, to make way for new diners.I will never recommend this restaurant to anyone cos besides the staff being unfriendly and not approachable, the man behind the till, a Mr Kim I feel was also very abrupt and rude when comes to speaking to customers. Definitely not value for money and extremely foo

...and I need not say more! Variety of meats and side dishes aren't overflowing, but the spread keeps everyone busy and satisfied. The restaurant is run by a Korean couple (I guess) and 90% of the staffs are also natives. They even have Febreze fabric spray on standby for that after smell on your shirts! How thoughtful is that? *wink

We went there for a saturday lunch & ate for almost 2 hrs. There were four of us and we ate mostly grilled food. I loved the spicy pork. I also liked the rice drink. My friends tried out the pre-cooked food but i was happy with eating all grilled so i did not. What i didnt like as much is the salt/pepper with the sesame oil (thought the one from goki day is much better) & they do not help you clean the grill often (goki day cleaned it often)

Went with my colleagues to the branch at United Square. Made a reservation for 7 adults and 1 child. They gave us a corner seat with 6 chairs and no room for the baby chair. I requested to change a table but was rejected by the staff. He told me, "All these have reservation." I asked him to kindly show me how to have everyone seated at such a cramped area. He turn and walked off. I walked over to the counter, queued and waited for the someone to speak to me. He then allocate another seat for us. This time round, a table with only 1 grill. We were all hungry, so we decided to take the seat and save the hassle of changing and waiting again.Service was slow, no one came to clear the table. I have to clear it myself and look for the service staff and pass it to them. There was not much aircon for the restaurant. The BBQ smell will definitely stay. The queue for the food was messy. The food always runs out.If you are looking for cheap korean BBQ with free flow servings of meat. You can consider coming here. We paid $22 ++ per pax. If you are looking for good service and all, not recommended

This place is nothing special. Could best be described as a cafeteria with rows of simple tables. What it offers though is quality beef and pork with some good side dishes at a very affordable price of S$15 for lunch and S$24 for dinner. If you like Korean BarBQ you will like it and if you never tried it this is an affordable way to give it a try. Very no frills and completely self service. Location is very convenient on second floor of Bras Basah Complex. To be clear, my rating of excellent is on value for money and quality of the beef and pork. Service is nil and you are the chef. Decor is minimal

I tend to eat in restaurants which are busy and full of local people as it is a good indicator that the food is good. I was staying in Chinatown and this restaurant was just around the corner. There must have been 100 people inside and although I was on my own, they found me a table even though it was a Saturday night and the place was full. The idea of cooking my own meat at table was very appealing and there were lots of meats and sea food available, along with plenty of vegetables, sauces, soups, noodles, rice and fresh fruit. You can eat as much as you like for a set price of $24 with the proviso that if you take more than you can eat and waste food, they will charge extra. I enjoyed my meal immensely and was surprised that I seemed to be the only elderly, female, westerner eating there

We visited the United Square outlet on 23/06/2013 for dinner. Arrived about 7.10pm, the place was not fully booked. The first item my 2 kids get from the buffet was the ginseng chicken soup and it was lukewarm. It seems that those were the last 2 bowls of ginseng chicken soup. While waiting for them to replenish, I helped myself to the rest of the items available. Their Kim chi soup and seaweed soup were also lukewarm, very disappointing. I told a wait staff that their wafu dressing has run out and can he please replenish it – his immediate reply was “no stock”. Then about 7.30pm, the wafu dressing was replenished. This seems to be the start of my “great experience” with this buffet restaurant.About 7.45pm, I check with the person in charge when will the ginseng chicken soup be replenished – SSikkek’s stock reply: “no stock”.I told them that it was not even 8.00pm yet, and then they grudging said, “Madam, we can cook it now, but if we prepare it now, it will be of a large quantity, and our kitchen will have a lot of leftovers tonight”. I reminded them that it was only 7.45pm, how can they don’t replenish the items just because they are worried about leftovers. And I went back to my table.About 5 to 10 min later, the person in charge came and ask me “madam, are you able to wait for an hour for the chicken soup, as that is the time needed to prepare a fresh batch of chicken soup”, I told them yeah, sure….they should be replenishing the food since now is only about 8.10pm.I noticed there were still walk-in customers at that time so went and ask the person at the front desk (a Korean gentleman) what time is their last order, he said something like 10pm or 10.30pm.Their Facebook page indicated their weekend buffet is from 11.30am to 11.00pm. At 7.45pm, they are already running out of items with no intention of replenishing and most of the rest of the items available were tepid.  Non-existent customer service, lukewarm food, food run out way before closing time without intention to replenish. That sums up Ssikkek BBQWe left this place at 8.35pm and no prizes for guessing it right - the ginseng chicken soup pot is still empty
3
We went there as a group of 10. We made a reservation the previous day and when we arrived, our table was ready. It is one of those all you can eat places for something like 24 dollars, if I'm not mistaken. There is plenty of meat available, but some of it of so-so quality. The place looks a little proper ventilation so we smelled of our food when we left. Keep in mind,there are no hot drinks, not even tea, available, even for an additional payment

If you are in a hurry, please don't go to Ssikkek Korean Grill BBQ Buffet, because you will probably need to wait in queue to get in. I usually visit the branch at Novena Ville for lunch (at least once a month) which is super cheap. Lunch is only $12++ with unlimited serving of authentic Korean side dishes, soups and fresh romaine to wrap up your BBQ meat that are well marinated and juicy to the very last bite, this place is heaven for budget buffet diners! The staff are very skillful in changing the aluminium foil for the BBQ, so you will not be cooking your food on charred blacken foil and risk getting cancer from it. Due to the en-bloc of Novena Ville, the restaurant will be moving to United Square soon, hopefully the standard will remain this good even in the new location

Been here so many times already. My korean colleague introduce us to this place. Food was superb! Very affordable price with a good quality of meats. They also offer cooked foods, their fried chicken is one of my favorites! Mr. Kim, the owner of the restaurant is very generous as he knows that we are regular diners, he always gives us free melona icecream! :)I suggest to make a reservation ahead of time to avoid the long queue! Spend your money wisely!Jecca Fernande

avoid this place at all costs if you are not prepared to queue to get in. Otherwise the food quality is top notch. Since this is buffet style, I would advise you to go on an empty stomach so as to be able to eat to your heart's delight as I am sure there are some dishes, you will be going for seconds or third helpings.Understandably due to the crowd, the staff are overwhelmed and may not offer you personalized service a la some fine dining restaurant but as long as you ask for something, they will provide you with it, sooner or later (Within a reasonable amount of time)

Located opposite Novena church,it is very popular with young customers. Buffet lunch & dinner charges are $12 and $22 before tax. Advisable to dress down and comfortably, make a reserrvation before going down with your friends. Very crowded on fri nite, we had a table for 18, enjoyed the food and company. Can be stuffy and crowded, dont expect restaurant service and you will not be disappointed. I find the kimchii and fried rice cake sweet and not spicy enough.

My family of 6 visited the novena outlet for lunch and the service is horrible. There was this particular petite girl with big plastic frames who doesn’t acknowledge when you try to get her attention and instead tells you off saying that she is attending to other tables first.No smiles, excuse me, please hold on etc and it happened thrice. The Philipino staffs are pleasant and helpful so we turned to them for help instead after this really nasty girl. The “aunties” there are polite so we were unlucky to get that girl serving our section. Our observations confirmed that she is the sort who doesn’t smile at diners and is just plain miserable working as a waitress. Even my dad who is a really patient man shook his head at her curtness. We won’t be going back there ever again no matter how good the food as there was no service recovery after our feedback
