Very tasty fish. Spicy, so ask for few peppers if you're not into spice. Had a refreshing passion fruit beverage - perfect for a hot Singapore day. Service was fair.

If you love spice food, this is the place for you. Food is overall average, nothing outstanding.
You cannot taste whether the fish is sweet or not as it is covered by spices... You know it is not spoilt...
Overall still ok.

I loved this little restaurant. Went back twice. Nice staff and excellent Chinese Food. Try their Garlic Strignbeans, totally "out of sight".

The fish is well cooked. You can choose the spicy level. I would recommend medium spicy. I gad tried the extremely spicy level but if you cannot handle spiciness please do no try. You will encounter toilet trips after that. In addition, the concept of the restaurant is nice and staffs are friendly.

Good service and food was tasty. Not for those that can't take chili though. Almost every dish was spicy. Deep fried fish skin was very good as were the vegetables. Only thing that let it down was how salty everything was. Unable to sleep as had to keep getting up for water!

We saw the buffet promotion, the price looks reasonable so we decided to go for that. You can order whatever on the menu except drinks. Food overall are good for me except it is quite oily for some. The highlight are the grilled fishes. 3 of us had 2 fishes and some other dishes. We consider big eater as we finished all the food.

Booked a table at Chongqing in Chinatown. Had a couple of Harbin beers out the front as we were early. Ordered the whole red snapper and a few other dishes. Service was prompt - my partner speaks fluent Chinese, so that makes life easier despite the fact all speak English !! Four friends ate and drank and the bill was $120. We all agreed that it would have been so much more in Melbourne. The whole snapper came to the table with it's own tabletop cooker to keep it warm

The fish was bbq-ed to perfection then laid on top of the other ingredients we ordered on the side like noodles, potatoes, vegetables and etc. The fish was exceptionally fresh and delicious.We only chose mild spicy as we did not know what to expect of the spiciness level.Overall, the dining experience was enjoyable and we will come back for it again.Better to get there early like 5.45 - 6pm before the crowd starts to queue up for their turns
