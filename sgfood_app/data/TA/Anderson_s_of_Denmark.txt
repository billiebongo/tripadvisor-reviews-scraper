I always thought this brand rivals Royal Copenhagen ice creamery (their outlets are opposite each other at Adelaide’s Glenelg beach) as they have similar names –suggesting their connection to the Scandinavian country - Denmark. However, surprisingly Anderson’s ice cream has its roots in Singapore! Having tried Royal Copenhagen beforehand I wanted to know if Andersons was better. I took their single scoop vanilla bean flavor on a waffle cone with chocolate sauce topping. The quantity was much lesser than that of Royal Copenhagen; however the waffle cone was superior with its supreme crispy texture and biscuit-like sweet flavor. The chocolate sauce was unnecessary; it had a gelatinous consistency that I found weird. The ice cream had a mild vanilla flavor and was extremely dense and creamy, it reminded me of the Turkish ice cream ‘Dondurma’ that I had in Istanbul few years back. Dondurma is much denser than regular ice cream and doesn’t melt easily thanks to the addition of starch extracted from a type of Orchid. Rates are slightly on the higher side – a single scoop costs $5.5. Sydney’s darling harbor has it’s outlet, but you rather pay a visit to the nearby Gelatissimo; agreed that Gelato is a different genre of dessert than the ubiquitous ice cream, but considering the variety, quality and pricing Gelatissimo, Darling harbor is a better choice

The ice cream is full of flavour and portions sizes just nice inside the cones, although you can get a tub or an edible tub.Standard is 2 scoops which you can mix and match.I have tried cookies and cream, mint choc chip and strawberry cream all very tasty - there are many different flavours to indulge in

This is the first time I had Anderson's of Denmark Ice Cream. I had the strawberry yoghurt ice cream cone, and my husband had the almond chocolate bar, which was a bit too thick for him.  They also sold a lot of different varieties of cakes, which looked delicious
