The food was delicious and fresh. Service was also good. The duck green curry is highly recommended for the flavours but all the food was very flavoursome. Would happily eat here again. They were surprisingly accommodating of our two young children as well.

Had a really nice meal in a nice location (on club street). It was weird that there were no other tables at the restaurant, we were the only people dining at the restaurant. Food was genuinely good! The wine list could be better though.

Had a wonderful meal here. Loved the Tom yum soup, shrimp spring rolls and everything else we ordered. Yum!

I was there for my birthday; and we ordered a selection of share dishes.. Being in Singapore we thought it was opportune to order the "soft shell crab in Singapore chilli crab sauce"... This was the first disappointment, the sauce is nothing like what one would experience at authentic restaurants like "Jumbo", "No Signboard" or "Long Beach" (down at East Coast Seafood precinct). If they call this "fusion" as their website states, they've failed miserably. Next the salted egg yolk prawns had no flavour and the quality of this same dish at hawker centres (eg Newton Circus Food Centre) is a better option. The Vietnamese beef salad offered tough beef - not what you would expect at a mid-range/up-market dining experience. On a positive note, the deserts could not be faulted

Actually a coincidence that we found this rooftop bar on top of one of the trees at gardens at the bay. We just enjoyed the music and lightshow by night in these spectacular gardens and passed by the entrance by surprise. A little fee later we had an amazing view and a nice cocktail in our hands

I have recenty visited the bar, and it was a very pleasant experience. The atmosphere was very relaxing - the bar is rather quite and not overcrowded like majority of places with paniramic view. The bar opens view on 360 degrees which is also quite outstanding.The ordered food was prepared extremly fast and turned out to be tasty.The coupon drink was served in a plastic glass what was quite strange, but the next ordered drink was served in a normal glass.The service staff was attentive to demands and pleasant.Overall - I liked the bar will come back and recommend to friends

There was just a handful of us who agreed to part with $20 to enjoy the view and a glass of wine the day we visited. We were away from the crowds and sat outside to drink in the fabulous view. Mesmerised we stayed for lunch. The food was overpriced but ok. The service on the other hand was terrible. When the diners are outnumbered by the staff you would expect more. I would pay the $20 again and linger longer over my drink but lunching or dining......NO

We made a reservation for the restaurant and we pointed this out a couple of times but we were seated downstairs in the bar on what I can only describe as really uncomfortable low outdoor furniture which wasn't particularly clean. I was sat next to a fake banana tree which was thick with dust and covered in spider webs. The table needed a good clean as did the plastic menus. The food actually was not bad at all but all sauces were served in little plastic take away pots. There was no air con to note and the service was not attentive. The serving staff were more interested in the drink service outside and to top it off the bar man inside spent quite a lot of the time shouting at his colleagues. We won't be returning

This is at the top of one of the trees and we booked in advance before travelling to avoid disappointment, how often do you get to eat in a restaurant like this? It's a bit pricey but well worth it. Great atmosphere. The views are incredible, there's a walkway that you can walk out onto whilst waiting for food etc. The food was great too, although a little disappointed to receive only luke warm rice with the main course. Although everything else was tasty and large portions too. After the meal, it's also well worth visited the rooftop bar for the amazing views up there too.
5
We timed our reservation for during the nightly light show and it was amazing. The food was excellently presented, the cocktail and drink selection almost limitless and the view spectacular. The music was a bit odd, an 80's remake mix set to reggae? We couldn't stop laughing about it. Still, it was a magical night for us

Cute, quaint little place, perfect for a few drinks with friends during happy hour. Everything about this place is adorable. We only came for drinks so I could not review the food.

Not worth the $12 entrance fee.should be free with the only requirement that you buy a drink. Bad seats too

I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a few reasons. The food was very well presented and tasted really, really good. The views from the restaurant are well worth the visit. The ambience of the restaurant is very relaxed and comfortable and I didn't feel rushed during my meal. I went with a friend who was also in Singapore and I am glad that I did.The prices are quite reasonable and the smaller plates have generous portions (see photos) though the wines are expensive but this is the case with most Singapore restaurants.It specializes in seafood dishes with either single or shared plates but there is also a good choice of meat dishes.Note that there is a minimum spend of $80.00++ per person. The ++ are taxes, so work on an average of about 10% above the price you see on the menu eg $80.00++ will be about $88.00I would definitely go back there to eat

Located in the Park by the Bay in the tallest central tower. We took advantage of the S$12 per head offer to pop up to the viewing platform (which was amazing) before dropping down one level to the restaurant where we had a cold drink (included) and spent some time in the air conditioning.Staff were helpful and friendly + there are facilities available to Customers.Given prices in Singapore we didn't feel it was bad value for money - it very much depends on respective exchange rates

Even with only 3 tables occupied on the 24th December. The service was slow and not attentive. The soft shell crab was over cooked in lots of oil. The steam fish was full of garlic, we had an expensive bottle of Mcguigan Shiraz from Australia $130, the host never came and topped up the glasses. When we ordered the dessert they did not have the dish on the menu. Banana Fritter with Ice Cream. We had vouchers for $400 and they would not give us the change back....even though I had paid $400 the manager Nizam was no help

Tucked in second level of shophouses along the hustle bustle Club Street, this place is overshadowed by hip bars around.But once you're inside, the ambience will transfer you to different place as how Indochina wants to place itself. Love it!Food is amazingly good, service is very nice, but it's just slightly overprice.However, if you're a big fan of Salmon Sashimi and Oyster, come on Wednesday and they have them as a 'secret' menu with a super competitive price tag! (I won't spoil it

We were there for the Oyster promotion that they were having. For the price, it is definitely worth the trip here. Good quality shucks and 1 for 1 drink ( not applicable to all hence please check with wait staff on the selection ). Other food selection is available. We had the sashimi and garlic beef. All good. Overall, had a great experience

I ordered squid and Hokkaido scallops. What a disaster. The squid was obviously frozen and then thawed. The result was the texture was almost Slimy. I waited more than 50 minutes waiting for the 36$ and still waiting. On top of that the place was dead . No reason then on top of it scallops were col

We were in a bit group of 11 so they set us up upstairs in a long table. Downstairs seems to be pretty crowded. The dishes were definitely Indochinese. We had Somtam (papaya salad), Tomyum, grilled scallops, vegetables, curries and they were all good. Maybe the somtam is a bit strong (fishy) most of my colleagues of different nationalities (Danish, Turkish, Australian, Indian) didn't like it. Service was generally good though the beer took some time to come.

We ate at the 2nd floor, there are 2 type of seats available. One is the purple color soft cloth seats, which is very comfortable. the other one is the smaller metallic seats, which feels very much like the patio furniture, not comfortable at all. The menu consists of vietnamense, laos, and south east asian mix. We ordered the spring roll, black peppered beef, tom yum soup, and seafood platter. Well, the appetizers ( rice paper spring roll, seafood platter ) actually came after evereything else. The black pepper beef is flavorful, but, quite chewy and not tender at all. The friend spring roll was dry. Overall, the food was really not very exciting, and seems to be geared more for tourist

Great deals for 1 for 1 housepour beer/wines and spirits .they also have monthly promotions to choose from wines , beers etc. Do check it out from the friendly staffs or managers for more promotions. Excellent service and great deals!

Restaurant was located at 47 Club Street, Singapore. Been here many times with friends and recommended this restaurant to my manager to have our team dinner here. Nice environment and friendly staffs. The food was fantastic. Highly recommended.

Very nice indoor design both downstairs and upstairs. Food is very varied and it's fun to try Lao or Cambodian food. We enjoyed the downstairs cushion sitting area with our son and the 2 for 1 happy hour drink deal.

Well, it is not a Vietnamese cuisine place, the choice of Vietnamese dishes is limited, they only carry the most common ones. But they offer some nice Thai and Khmer specialties.
Staff was nice. Price is high.

I have been to many of the Indochine group restaurants in Singapore. This was my first time in the Club street venue & as always the owners have the formula right. Great food & great service.

This review is meant for Indochine holland Village. Arrived at the restaurant and asked for the host if we were supposed to grab a seat or to wait to be seated as we were waiting for 10 mins without anyone attending to us and there were empty tables. Host just gave us the talk to the hand and said "wait!". Than she proceeded with the question" how many?" We were than seated with a no smile what so ever nor welcome. Than after a couple of drinks a waitress came to the table and said I have a big group coming, move to the next table. There was no courtesy or even a simple please. I do not know how Indochine provide or employ thier people but this restaurant has the worst hospitality and I can't believe how rude and obnoxious the employees we have encountered. I would never ever recommend anyone to this restaurant. Don't expectant service and they definite don't look happy with their job

We chose this restaurant prior to seeing the Gardens by the Bay sound and light show. On booking we were advised of a $80 minimum spend, and discovered on asking for our bill it was an $80 per head spend- difficult to do if you have kids not drinking alcohol. Perhaps they need to change to a degustation or set menu? A shame really as the food was delicious. Service inattentive and in need of work.

We had not been there for a few years and based on previous visits we were full of expectations. Not fulfilled. Half empty on a Friday night and if not for the bachelorette party close to empty. Food was from ok to not good at all, the latter being their signature main course dish.Service was ok, but then again should be. Club Street was full of people and life, should have dined somewhere else
5
The staff was extraordinarily helpful and the food was great. once again the red curry was the star. Tried the vietnamese rice paper rolls and the spring rolls both were great. try the lemongrass beef for a unique nice beef dish. thanks for making the night enjoyable and paying attention to our needs
5
Been here many times for drinks. Very good ambience and very friendly and helpful staff. Value for money.If you ever need a place to unwind and feel relaxed, Indochine at Club Street is a place to go. The staff service is excellent which makes me keep coming over

The original Indochine in Singapore. The one by the Asian civilisation museum is closed. Also has a new one in the Gardens by the bay. We went to the original and had a great meal. Club street is also lively for bars.

Dined with a group. Wine requested was not available. No sparkling mineral water available (offered soda water). Food was OK, however expensive for the quality and what was presented.

Larb Gai or Laab Kai, whichever pronunciation is at its best at Indochine on Club Street. And God knows, as a fan I tried them all up to Geylang! This particular one is fresh, delicious, spicy as it should. Ingredients of quality, ample serving, if combined with nan kaoh, absolutely splendid. Pliz go and let me know..

As a fussy eater, the kway teow @ IndoChine was surprisingly delicious and up to expectation. In addition, I went there with my boyfriend and he was in love with the mango sticky rice. Do drop by and try it :) Choose a food of your own preference and you'll enjoy it more

So it was a anniversary of ours, I made a reservations to the restaurant and secured a table for two, also dropped by earlier in the day to deposit a gift that was meant to be a surprise for my other half. The manager greeted us warmly and seated us at a private corner on the 2nd level.Environment rating was a cool 9/10 rating I must say, with lots of abstract art / design pieces & not to mention a huge water feature connecting both levels.We wanted to to place our orders, but being first timers here @ Savanh, honestly we were clueless about the menu, so we kindly gestured for the attention the service staff and asked for some recommendations. For the next 5mins, we were given a detailed breakdown on what seemed to be a complex menu, and we didn't hesitate further to place our orders.So in the end, we had 3 appetizers & also a entree to share, namely1) CHAO TOM - Vietnamese Prawn on Sugarcane2) CHA GIO - Crispy Vietnamese Spring Rolls3) THIT BO LUC LAC - Pepper beef with garlic and butter4) INDOCHINE FRIED RICEThese items are simply amazing. Service was prompt as well. We only a waited for a cool 12-15min before everything was served together on the table. Upon laying down our dishes and knowing we're first timers, the manager came by to present the dishes and to set our expectations right.Honestly, I can no longer find such services in the local scene anymore, this is more than a work, a personal touch was felt.Shortly after we're done with our meals, I signaled for my gift to be brought forward, the manager then came forth with the bouquet of roses and was warmly presented to partner. This was more than what I could ask for, seamless service!To end the perfect evening, gave a tip of $20 :)I'll be back

We were a group of 26 celebrating a colleague's retirement. The set menu and free flow drinks was a great deal. The food was outstanding as well as the service. A special thank you to Sam, Joey, Nizam, and Ting for making it a very nice and special dinner
5
We came here for the food and it was amazing. We were seated on the second floor for dinner and the atmosphere was very comfortable and inviting. We ordered many different dishes for the 6 of us and enjoyed each item greatly. The dishes were beautifully prepared and the flavors exceeded expectations. I was a very happy man at the end of this meal.As a side note based on the clientele and what I saw of their orders, most people come here to enjoy drinks and the oysters. The bar area downstairs was very busy for a Wednesday night
5
My last meal before trekking to the airport, Indochine was stunning - huge flavours and more food than we could eat, some decent wine by the glass and great service. Shame the place had only one other table occupied while we were there, but I guess that guaranteed us prompt service
5
Lovely unusual flavours in magical setting, would definitely go again, loved the Vietnamese flavours and the atmosphere. The views from the tree were delightful. The staff were attentive which added to the pleasure able experience. We didn't mind paying a little extra for this unmissable experience

We put Indochine on our list because of high ratings on past reviews. Perhaps we went on the wrong day of the week, perhaps it was the chef's day off. The food was sad - not fresh, seafood overcooked to rubber flavours unbalanced. But on the plus side, our complaints instantly acknowledged with apologies, and an overgenerous adjustment made to our account. We won't be back, but they are good people and we think they are trying to get it sorted
