It’s quite a nice place for a date considering the decorations and cute food presentations. Very creative and yummy foods but as always, the food looks quite different from the menu (kinda a letdown)

We had lunch at this cafe. We ordered baked rice, sandwich and the Dutch Baby pancake with apple caramel.
The pancake was served in hot cast iron pan. It was delicious and the portion was good for sharing.

We found this place by accident, had the quant gravity teapots and great smoothies but the best thing was the mango pancake ---the best ever----do your tastebuds a favour and go there.

This is one cute and brightly decorated Japanese desert café, located in the basement of Paragon. We were seated after five minutes although there were empty tables. They were lacking staff hence it was understandable.The pancake is the specialty, and it really lived up to its name! Very fluffy and full, not the normal flat kind you'd find elsewhere. The vanilla ice cream is creamy and coupled with the maple syrup made it sweet (kind of killed the vanilla taste I'd say.) Fruits and berries were fresh and everything tasted fine.The tart was quite a large slice! It's mostly full of cream, but the cream was tasty! Couldn't stop helping myself to it. Tasted better than the ice cream itself! There was glazing and the strawberry sauce drizzled on the plate made it sweeter. This is also something you should order.The fries though not on the menu can be ordered separately with a premium. It tastes somewhat like McDonalds and was not bad! Quite a big bowl.We were pleased with the service. Though they were short-handed, the staff attended to our needs quickly. They were friendly - allowed us to order food not on the menu. Thumbs up for going the extra! We had a nice dessert session that day. Great food, good service and pleasant experience overall. (A grade!)Will return to try the savoury dishes – they look very appetizing!

I accidentally saw DBC on my way home. The cafe layout was difficult to miss - warm lights, cozy environment. Though I passed the cafe, I had to come back to check out their menu.The menu and the fake display were truly inviting so I chose to have sort of a late lunch. I had a DBC signature dish, Pork Cutlet Omurice, which came with a side of salad. Enjoyed the pork and fluffy omelette, plus the rice, of course. Perfect complement was cold, freshly squeezed orange juice.For dessert, I recommend the mixed berry chocolate. It's a fruit tart made up of strawberries, blueberries, raspberries over chocolate cream and tart. It contains a bit of alcohol. Superb taste. Not too sweet.Fantastic food, excellent service. I got a very good first impression of Dutch Baby Cafe.Oh, and I haven't even tasted their specialty - puffy German pancake. I'll definitely be back for more

I was there at Paragon on 22/12/2016 after shopping at Metro. Too early for dinner so we popped into Dutch Baby cafe cos of the variety of pancakes they had. They serve Katsu sandwiches too like at Takashimaya basement. We had mixed fruit pancake n it was soooo good. Light, with super crisp corners with icing sugar dusted on top plus topped with generous ice cream that didnt melt that fast though the pancake n pan was hot. We shared but I think I could finish it by myself cos it was the size of Pizza hut pan pizza however it was light, thin and so nice. Was priced around $13.80-17.80 and if u take the set(additional $3), u get a pot of tea (choice of sangria, flower etc). Big pot enough for 2. Must go n must try. Their display is not so attractive so u must see the real thing n you will wanna go back there again
