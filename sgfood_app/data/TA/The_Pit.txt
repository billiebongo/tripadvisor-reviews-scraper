這裡的Draft Beer和酒本來就很便宜，$9.9/pint，星期二晚上來的時候更加有Promotion，$16有兩pint。很喜歡Irish Ale，很清甜。Bar food也是很便宜，Fish & Chips $10，份量很多，而且炸得很新鮮，好好吃。不要點雞翼，太咸了。

Tucked away at the far end of holland village, away from the sports bar crowd. A nice selection of craft beers. The surprise comes in the must have burger.

The location is far from the busy and crowded part of Holland Village which is great for my friends and I to have a night of drinks and talk.They sell Archipelago beer in which they have different choices. My favourite is still the pear cider.Drinks are affordable but not much food to choose from.I still miss their garlic fries although they no longer have this is their menu

Since being introduced to The Pit almost a decade ago, I have always liked this cosy HV pub which is open to the air and always seems to have great staff and first rate Archipelago brews. Now a trip to Singapore is never complete without a reunion at The Pit with old friends and some eats at nearby Crystal Jade or the hawker centre. The pub food at the Pit is not bad either if you fancy fish and chips, sausages, a burger or chicken tikka masala. Archipelago brews are consistently good and with two for one offers during happy "hour" (before 10 pm when we last visited) are great value. If taking a taxi home, take the stairs up to the road at the back (Holland Ave) and the taxi rank is about 50 metres away to you left (saves a roundabout walk out along Lorong Liput)

IF you are over many of the places in Holland Village, back behind the COld Storage there is the Pitt. This is not your fancy place this is a come as you are and have a beer or two and meet locals as well as long time Expats. Typical bar food fair, and a great place to have a drink first then head over to Chip Beet Garden for a nice dinner.Get there early as by night fall it is packed with regulars. But not to worry all are friends when you go to the Pitt

If you're tired of the usual Holland Village scene and Tiger beer in Singapore, This place is at the bottom of the other end of from where most of the restaurants are. It serves great music and Holland Village's first microbrew which actually is the earliest brewery (Archipelago beer) babyback ribs, hot wings and Chish and Fips. Simple and wonderful food, warm and friendly service and quaint games. Its alfresco and evenings are a great time to watch the Singapore scene go by as you sip on a beer. Last time I tried the steak and burgers weren't quite as good as the ribs or fish.Started by a well known restaurateur, Rossi fan and Paris trained Chef the late Saran Dorairaj, it is a legacy left to two brothers who still remember the man on a wall with his quotes like "....leave the awnings open when you close for the night....because there are a lot of homeless people who will need a dry place..." - Saran. They play the music he collected over his lifetime and cook, clean, serve and talk to guests.Overall a simple quaint place with its own identity and purpose and uniquely Singapore...
